But I can speak to the quality of this phone model - which I highly recommend to anyone on a budget looking for a fast smart phone with great call quality.The biggest con on this phone is that you can only save photos and videos to your SD card - not your apps. This is a problem because the internal phone memory is REALLY tiny.  I don't have many apps and the phone freaked out and ran out of memory in a few minutes, then it couldn't update any apps because it was full.  I was able to work around this by clearing everything out and NOT downloading any apps other than what was factory installed (they try to automatically import when you enter your g-mail account information). I changed the settings to save to SD card - then when I did download apps, I FINALLY had the option to save to SD.  If you save to SD card, you have to leave the icon on the main screen.  I went to two Best Buys and no one could tell me how to do this. They told me the phone wasn't capable of saving apps to the SD card. I had to research online and after a few hours stumbled on a web page that described what to do to work around the memory partition.  If you import your apps BEFORE you insert the SD card and change the settings, there is no option to save to SD. If you try to change settings to SD after you have apps installed, it gives you a warning message that you will basically make the apps unstable and it persuades you not to do this.  Downloading any app moving apps didn't help this situation or allow them to move (no option available to do so). Anyhow, it appears most retailers don't know (or disclose) whether the a phone can save apps to an SD card, so you may want to research this on any phone model you are interested in purchasing.  It appears, after my research that Huawei is known to be fairly good about \"allowing\" SD card to save apps.This memory issue aside, I am SHOCKED at how much I like the phone.  My last phone was an LG Connect - it got dismal battery life from the start (dead in three hours if it wasn't plugged into a charger).  This phone can sit on my desk all day and barely loses any battery. I can surf the net for hours and still I am barely down any juice.The speed is phenomenal, especially compared to the LG I had previously. The screen isn't the sharpest, but at this size, it doesn't matter much.  The camera isn't stellar. But the call quality is excellent and the surfing speeds are really fast. Considering that the next best phone is the Samsung and the price is about $400 more, this is the best you can do for a budget smart phone.My caveat was that I wouldn't get another LG phone because of the SD card unmounting issues and overheating and poor battery life on my last LG phone. In researching the \"best\" metro pcs smart phone I did note that the LG options didn't seem to have the same 4GLTE capabilities as this one and frankly, didn't look any better. Several sales people mentioned that LG phones tend to be \"buggy\" and indicated they would go for the Huawei over the LG.  I am glad, now that I've been using the phone, that I took their advice.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent phone", "Author": "Belkis", "ReviewID": "RETOF8VTH8XXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great product, excellent price i bought it for a gift and hes really happy with it, the phone is fast and very easy to use", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Calidad y buen precio", "Author": "Kenya St Bernard", "ReviewID": "R2FKJQJ049ZQ7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's just the phone that I needed.

The price tag is more than fair considering that many phones out there can add up more money for the same build.  However, I've encountered a defective unit which does not give this phone any justice to its respective build and price tag.  The issue I've encountered is the phone doesn't seem to carry the electric charge, therefore, the moment you turn it on even though the charge states that the phone is at a 100%, it will automatically shut the phone down.  I've never made it on the home screen...Now, going accordingly to give this phone and its manufacturer some justice based on professional companies who had spent time on this phone and enough time to give it some reviews along with many people who had reviewed this phone, I would honestly say this phone is a 4.5/5.0.  Here's some Pros and Cons accordingly to what I've seen:Pros:-PRICE TAG:  Not many people understand this concept.  You get what you pay for!  Obviously you're buying this phone and cannot compare it an IPhone or a Note 3 (which I proudly own both).-Screen:  This is mainly the only thing I was able to take a look at (on the phone that I've bought) considering the fact that I wasn't able to make it to the home screen LOL.  The screen is smooth and doesn't seem to be easily damaged.  Anyone who has damaged theirs, here's a tip:  DON'T THROW IT AROUND!  You've got to be super careless to even get a scratch on this phone.  Here's a second tip:  BUY A SCREEN PROTECTOR!  :)-Resolution:  The resolution is fair.  Once again, you get what you pay for so please do not compare it a $700 phone with at least 15 megapixel, along with HD specifications, etc.  Once again, you get what you pay for.-Performance:  I've seen this phone in action from a friend who bought this quite a while back.  Yes, it is a fast phone but the more apps you leave open, the more slower the phone gets.  Please consider the fact that the price tag is at a $100.  So please don't be upset at the phone if it starts to slows down due to it's 512 ram built in it.  It's a no brainer even with networked advertised phones out there.  if you don't like, spend $700 or so or get a contract to get it lower.-Size:  I have a ton of phones of all different sizes and brands.  I collect them.  The phones size is not too big, and not too small, and easy to carry around.  Phone sizes has been an \"On and off\" trend.  At one point, the smaller the phone, the better it trended, and when smartphones went big, the bigger it was the better... until the public became aware of the battery usage.  The size it equivalent to an IPhone 4, making it easy to carry in your pocket with or without a case.Cons:-Here is one biased detail I will give.  I received a defective unit.  The phone doesn't make it to the home screen at all.  The battery doesn't seem to carry the charge even after a days worth of charging.  Now, is this the phone's fault?  I say \"no it isn't\" considering that this maybe the course of my luck doing its run.  There's always going to be defects as you one tries to manufacture anything.  Even as carefully as a company can, there's ALWAYS going to be a defective unit, even with a very well established company supported by an actual network.  It took me three tries ordering an HTS Inspire when they first launched and finally got a working one though AT&T.;  I know life isn't fair but why me?  LOL  :)-Quality/Back Cover:  Okay, here it is.  Even with the price tag and I stating several times \"you get what you pay for,\" the back panel which you open in able to put your SIM Card seems a bit thin and flimsy.  It seems that a bit of pressure applied to the panel can damage it easily.  Accidents happen... get it a bit more secured.-Operating System:  This more to like \"in between\" rather than a Con.  Here we go again with the price tag but here's a tip for manufacturers:  don't try to put the latest operating system on the phone with only 512 ram on it.  It's like trying to play Crisis on a Windows Vista with only 4 gigs of ram and a very low end graphics card.  You can play it, but its will be very frustrating.  The latest OS Version of android is very nice, but with only 512 ram, seems that you're just trying to hurt someone or yourself.  Still very nice for the price tag though LOL :)-Volume:  The volume is fair but with other phones on the similar price tag trying to compete on a guerilla market strategy implemented on this day of age, you've got to stay in the game and offer a better quality.Overall:It is a great phone definitely accordingly to its price tag.  The screen and resolution is justifiable along with the size and performance.  However, the quality is not where it should be at considering that the phone seems to be very fragile especially the back panel.  The phone seems to be a \"one-drop-dead\" quality meaning that it only takes you to drop it once and you can say your condolences, however, it is justifiable with the leather case you can buy easily on Amazon.With unlocked smartphones flooding the market these days, the OS plays a big role and for a phone with 512 ram built in, it seems a bit risky trying to justify the latest OS on a phone with 512 ram.  it's doable but patience is required.  It's a risk for a company to add or deduct a key feature and may seem that boosting its performance or deducting the feature to be a candidate on its price tag may do the trick to make everyone happy, but it is a risk for a company to do so.  This is what they went with, therefore, this is what we have but don't compare it to the latest of the latest brands with super features and expect it under the price tag it has now.  This is reality, you get what you pay for.If I didn't receive a defective unit, accordingly to my little experience on the phone I had purchased along with me tinkering with my friends phone and other professional reviews, I would give this phone a 4.5 out of 5P.S.  You get what you pay for.

There is a lot of good sub $200 Android phones, but my target is to get something in the $100 price point. At this price level, there is a lot of junk. I finally decided on this Y300 because Amazon had a used one form their Warehouse deal for less than $100.The item that I got was a prepaid Bell Canada version, model Y300-0151, running Android 4.1.1. No carrier branding on the phone, and it is unlocked (tried a T-Mobile SIM and it worked). It uses standard mini SIM. First impression is that the screen is pretty decent. Many phones at this price point have really poor screen, with washed out colors and poor viewing angles. This Y300's screen is actually pretty good. It has decent resolution for the size too. There's no coating whatsoever though, so it collects fingerprints instantly.The OS has a custom Huawei skin. It offers quite a bit of customizations with themes, each with its own set of wallpaper and icons. You can even set what kind of animation you want to see when you slide to different home screens.As for the performance, well, you get what you paid for. The biggest issue is the 512MB RAM (the OS reported even less). I practically have to disable a ton of apps and services just to have an audio player running without crashing or restarting. Forget about having widgets and whatnot unless you want your phone to lag severely. I don't feel like I'm using a phone with dual core processor. Things can get laggy very quickly. Huawei put an option to restart the phone when you push and hold the power button, in case you need a quick reboot. I can't imagine how bad other phones are in this price range, where they are still running older single core snapdragons.Internal storage is quoted at 4GB. In reality, there's only about 900MB left for user space as most of the space are used by the OS and pre-installed apps (that you cannot uninstall). There's a microSD slot that is located separate from the battery, so you can hot-swap the card if you want to (make sure to un-mount it first from the OS). I did manage to get a 64GB microSDXC card to work with the phone. Using the card straight won't work. Also, the phone doesn't seem to be able to re-format a 64GB microSDXC properly. I have to format the card on my PC. Make sure to format it using FAT32 file system. Downside of this filesystem is that if you have a file or folder with extremely long name, apps will simply crash. I put my music in the SD card, and some of the folders have a fairly long name. Every apps that try to access the storage (the music player, file manager, etc) crashes. Took me some time to figure it out.Other tidbits: Camera is poor, but not much to expect at this price point.The speaker seems decent and loud enough. Doesn't support 5GHz wifi.So far, it fits for what I bought it for. The performance can be maddening due to the extremely low RAM. KitKat is supposed to have better memory footprint, but don't expect this phone to be updated at all.In short, if you really want a good cheap phone, spend a little bit more. Most other phones in this $100 price range probably are not any better as most of them seem to have 512MB of RAM. There are a lot of better Android phones once you go to the $200 price point.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "I don't recommend it", "Author": "Alejandra Fuenmayor", "ReviewID": "R2M7LVA1BZ2A1M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't know what happened, but when the cellphone arrived was the best, the camera was excellent, and the cellphone very fast, but suddenly the cellphone shut down and it didn't lit again! now the cellphone don't work", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is a great phone.", "Author": "Fredys G-Venezuela", "ReviewID": "R181PL9HGOR6GV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have just two three weeks with this phone and it has worked great.good screen resolution; a camera of 5 megapixel; and 4GB internal memory.

Before buying this phone I tried LG L7 P705 which turned out to be extremely slow - slow UI and even slower internet connection. It went back to Amazon. I also tried Blu 4.5 Dash but it had build problems and was not connecting to my car using bluetooth. It also went back to Amazon.So far I like this phone a lot - it connects to my car, has responsive UI, internet is reasonably fast with AT&T.;2 core cpu is fast enough for most applications.This phone has a customized UI and instead of hating it, I actually like it!Couple of issues related to connectivity: for some reason it was not able to connect to internet until I entered all connectivity options in settings. All other phones I used recently were able to connect to AT&T; without any extra steps. Another issue is  that internet speed is not very high, I think it is less than 1Mb/s. The phone shows \"H\" instead of \"H+\", I think that explains slower internet speed. Still, internet works reasonably fast for checking email and some light browsing.Build quality is good, although it is not one of those super slim models. On the other hand, being fatter, the phone actually feels like a phone and not like a thin piece of paper.Battery life is ok but not great. It can last 2 days with little use or 1 day with heavy use.I was not able to install Skysafary pro on this phone because it does not give much space to application.
