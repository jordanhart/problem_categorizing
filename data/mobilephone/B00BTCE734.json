Am using easy battery saver now  and it helps  a lot. The phone also packs quite a bit of heat from the screen and from the back it self, not sure if that can be fixed thru software but if you are planning to make a lot of long calls, you might want to consider a blue tooth device in addition to this phone.Camera, pics looked okay on the phone out of the box but can be grainy when you start to view these on a larger display.  There might be some settings that are changed to get the hi res pictures that are advertised on gsm arena. But after some tinkering the camera can look great.Features and quality.Excellent screen does not get better than super amoled in my opinion, and resolution is top notch.Phone calls and texting feels as they should and sounds as they should.Beautiful finish and the white looks just perfect.Advanced features like the air and smart gestures work but I have not gotten the smart pause to work just yet. People are usually amazed by these features especially when little is known about the phone itself.In the end it is a great phone,with some unique features and high quality that needs some adjustments to get 5 stars but with the adjustments you can have lots of quality fun and experiences.Hope this was helpful.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Gonzalo", "ReviewID": "R2BWOXM3A1XYNV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product was brand new, eveything works well.I just would have known that the firmware of Android that came installed was from Singapore and just included English and Singapore languages.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "The product is perfect", "Author": "FELIX LEMA ORTIZ", "ReviewID": "RZU8OHRJZDL0A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally I have a celullar the best or the best I love it, because the options are very well for my applications for my job", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "multi-services", "Author": "mardy zenbaa", "ReviewID": "R3OQLQ9EBEBBVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has many services and applications cuz I can use it as laptop for using facebook and skype and other services such learning.
