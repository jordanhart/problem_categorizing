Very sleek, light weightb. Beautiful , and look good fashion accessoryc. If it is for a person who might need to use this to occasionally use the internet viz an occasional email or , get an address, or look up a restaurant etc.... it does the trickCons:a. Slow processorb. less responsive touchscreenc. not the most intuitive or user friendly phoned. Sound and ringtones are not too loud, if you work/live in a busy placeIn a nut shell, this is a great phone, but as the old adage goes \"there are no free lunches\", so you get more than what you pay for, a good started touchscreen semi smart phone. But this is no iphone, nor an alternative for a \"real\" smart phone", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2G Network:GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 / 3G Network:HSDPA 900 / 2100 /\nInternal Memory:128 MB storage, 168 MB RAM / EDGE:Class 10, 236.8 kbps / 3G:HSDPA / WLAN:Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g / Bluethooth:Yes, v2.1 with A2DP\nMessaging:SMS (threaded view), MMS, Email, Push email, IM / Browser:HTML / Radio:Stereo FM radio with RDS / Games: Yes /\nJava:Yes, via third-party application ; - Digital compass - MP4/H.263/H.264/WMV player -\nBattery:Standard battery, Li-Po 1200 mAh\nSize Dimension:99 x 54 x 15 mm / Weight:104 g / Display Type:TFT capacitive touchscreen\n16M colors / Display Size:320 x 480 pixels, 3.0 inches - Scratch resistant surface\nAccelerometer sensor for UI auto-rotate - Proximity sensor for auto turn-off - Timescape UI\nGPRS:Class 10 (4+1/3+2 slots), 32 - 48 kbps /\nCard Slot:microSD, up to 16GB, 2GB included /\nCamera:3.15 MP, 2048x1536 pixels / Video:Yes, VGA@30fps / OS:Android OS, v1.6 (Donut) / CPU:Qualcomm MSM7227 600 MHz processor /\nColors:White, Dark Blue/ White, Aqua Blue/ White, Pink/ White, Silver/ White / GPS: Yes\nMP3/eAAC+/WMA/WAV player - TrackID music recognition - Google Search, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Calendar, Google Talk - Facebook app", "Name": "SONY ERICSSON XPERIA X8i (BLACK)/ BRAND NEW ORIGINAL UNLOCKED INTERNATION GSM PHONE (NO WARRANTY)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413rurUDKXL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0049FVMQ8"}}
