{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A solid, basic phone", "Author": "Comdet", "ReviewID": "RSICR30WQT542", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Summary: Excellent for texting, good sound quality and decent battery life. It won't impress anyone who likes leading edge phones, but it is a great option if you're looking for a basic, text-friendly phone and don't want to spend the bucks for a smart phone.Review:My requirements for a new phone was that it have a QWERTY keyboard, be easy to use, and have a decent battery life. I went with this model since pre-paid plans are a perfect match for my needs, plus it is CDMA, which means in my area it runs on Verizon. Tracfone's plan (with TMFL) came in at a better price than any other carrier for my usage patterns.Build quality: Pretty good. It feels substantial, and the slider works well with very little play or sloppiness. The keyboard keys are easy to push and register a keystroke. The keyboard is also backlit, making it a snap to see what you're typing in low light. Also clear to see the key markings in bright sunlight. I was surprised at how well it was put together given the price.Sound quality: Excellent when speaking into the phone. Invariably, when I asked people how I sounded, they said they thought I was using a land line. The sound quality on received calls was also excellent. The speaker phone was decent. Not the clearest I've heard, but certainly clear enough that it didn't interfere with use.Camera: Not bad for outdoor pictures or very well-lit indoor shots. The quality falls off quickly in dim light.Screen: Very clear and easy to read. No problems with legibility even with my aging eyes. It does get washed out in full sunlight, but retains readability.Texting: Such a joy to use the keyboard coming from a non-keyboard phone! Texts are limited to 160 characters, but that's what I was limited to on my old phone, so no change there. I wish the keys were bigger (both on the keypad and the keyboard) but I have that complaint with every phone I've used. Still, it is worlds better than any virtual keyboard I've ever used on a phone.Web: Poor. It works, but this is not the phone to get if you plan on doing a lot of web browsing. Slow and clunky, and the screen is too small for any meaningful use.Battery life: Appears to be excellent. I've been using this quite a bit for 3 days, and still have 2/3 battery life remaining. (Update: been using this for a while now, and find that the battery lasts about a week.)Convenience features: Like the fact that with the key lock on, you can still just hit any key and the screen will come up so you can check the time without actually unlocking the keypad. Also, you don't have to do the unlock if you slide out the keyboard - it automatically unlocks. If you accidentally hit the browser key you don't get dinged for a unit of time if you cancel it quickly. That was a real problem with my older phone (a Motorola) which would ding me for a unit as soon as I hit the browser button.Value: Love the TMPL! This keeps my monthly cost to a pittance compared with a traditional contract. Activation went smoothly and easily, although as a new Tracfone user, I didn't have any minutes to transfer (I've heard transferring minutes can be a bit of a chore). Really like that texts only cost 0.3 units.Bottom line: This phone won't impress anyone who's into leading edge phones. But I use a cell phone to talk and text every so often (usually about 30 min or so a month), and perhaps access the Internet once in a blue moon. I wanted a phone that makes those activities easy and cheap. This fits the bill perfectly. Very pleased, and highly recommend it as a basic phone.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung r455c vs. t404g", "Author": "E. Richards", "ReviewID": "R140KCNOEW2Y30", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just switched to the r455c from the t404g because I get much better reception from verizon than at&t.; I wish that wasn't the case, because I preferred the other phone. But I waste a lot of minutes on at&t; because the service drops out after I hit send on a message, or someone calls me and I can't understand them. The t404g was the best phone I've had to date. It took decent pictures and videos, the display was nice and texts were displayed well. The r455c has no video. The pictures are fuzzier, because the camera is smaller. The screen is larger, but so is the clock display. I prefer a smaller display with smaller sharper numbers and pictures.There is no real customization of the display beyond changing the wallpaper, and choosing whether the airtime due date and/or remaining minutes are onscreen. Most of the screens you click into have no \"back\" button. If you hit the \"c\" on the front of the phone it will take you to the previous screen.Photos cannot be edited on the phone. Including rotated. And the camera saves photos in landscape orientation, so if you are trying to take a picture to use as a wallpaper it's going to be sideways or cropped to the center if you turn your phone to take it. So take the picture with the phone sideways and set it up so the part you want is in the center of the photo. When I press the camera button on the side of the phone it often takes me to \"my folder\" instead of opening the camera- you have ot hold the button down. Camera options include # of shots, resolution (up to 1280x960), fineness, white balance, day or night shots, timer up to 10 seconds, color setting: normal, b&w;, sepia, negative, green, aqua, shutter sound, save settings. There is no zoom on the camera, and trying to take a close-up is pretty much pointless.Also, on the r455c there is no place to block numbers from texting or calling you. But I think that may be a Verizon thing, that they don't have that feature on their phones.And the texts, which is a big issue with me because it's pretty much all I use the phone for, are kind of annoying. You have to add a contact before you can even write a text. I don't like this, because if I accidently hit the ok button, which is located right next to the space bar, the text will send whether I wanted it to or not. The t404g you didn't have to add a contact to write the text, so if you accidently hit send it doesn't go anywhere. Also the t404g you could keep writing as long as you wanted, it would just add more pages to the text. The r455c you can write 160 characters per text that's it. So if you write alot, like me, you have to make an individual message for each text, you can't write one long text and send them all at once. (I am talking about regular SMS texts, not MMS texts which can have 1000 characters, 80 in the titles, and photos. Those are sent as data, not texts, and are a different thing. You can send MMS messages on the r455c.) I also like to write texts when I'm thinking about it and save them to send later so I don't bug my friends too much. With the t404g you could save the whole 4 or 5 page text as one item in the draft folder, and if you edited it you saved the new version and it replaced the old version. With the r455c you have to save each page individually, and if you  edit it it saves the new page separately so you have to go back and delete the previous page, hoping you picked the right one to delete, and if it was like the 3rd page of a 4 page text they will now be out of order.You can't scroll through the inbox, you have to open each text individually. If you decide you want to change an SMS to an MMS after you write it you can't. You have to start over, you can't just add a photo to what you've written.There are also only 2 text tones on the r455c, and there are 4 on the t404g. The one I prefer is not available on the r455c. Which is not a big deal, but you'd think since they are both Samsungs they'd have the same tones. I made my own.The bluetooth works fine for transferring files; I sent several picture and music files from my computer to the phone easily and quickly. BUT I paired it with my car stereo -- like I had previously done with the t404g with no problems -- and I had to disable the bluetooth on the phone after about 20 minutes because the phone kept restarting itself. Literally every two minutes it turned off. So there was no way... even if I got a call in those 2 minutes I couldn't have talked to anyone before the phone turned off again.The keyboard doesn't seem as glitchy as the t404g. Other than the default Abc setting disappearing and the poor location of the send button, the keys all respond as they should I don't have to erase half of what I write to correct missing or extra letters like I did with the t404g. The backlight goes away sometimes while you are typing and I have to turn a light on to finish writing. It is missing some basic symbols such as < and > on the keys so if you make a lot of hearts <3 or Santa hats o<0  it requires extra steps.You can lock the phone by pressing the lock key on the front to avoid pocket dialing.As usual, it is a hassle to get my minutes to transfer. I had to call because it would only transfer 1100 of my 2367 minutes online, and as of now I have 10 minutes and 59 service days of the 2367 minutes and 199 service days on my former phone. The last time I did this I had to write a nasty letter to the headquarters to finally get the rest of my minutes, I'm hoping it won't be as difficult this time but it's hard to say. It should be something you can do online tracfone has pretty bad customer service it's always a headache to deal with them at all. It's not that the people themselves are difficult, it's just sometimes they don't seem to understand what you are talking about, and tell you things that aren't always true. For people with fewer minutes to transfer it may be a simpler process. I didn't have any trouble transferring my 21 minutes that I have under a different number.The t404g was great, aside from the glitchy keyboard which either added 5 letters or no letters for m's b's s's and spaces but I really like getting to write one text with 4 pages instead of 4 separate texts. The r455c keyboard is set up a little differently. It has all the numbers grouped on the left side instead of across the top. That's probably something that it will just take time to get used to. But this set-up puts the \"s\" key right next to the number 5 key. They are about the same shape and size, so I keep hitting \"d\" instead of \"s\" because I tap the \"5\" which is on the \"d\" key, thinking it's the \"s.\" It takes longer for me to write texts, because I'm afraid of accidentally hitting the send key.As someone suggested, you can just put a 1 in the contact space so the text doesn't go anywhere if you hit send, but it DOES still send. It just doesn't send to a person. You still lose the minutes though and your text is now in the sent folder instead of the drafts folder. With the old phone that did not require a contact hitting send did nothing if it wasn't addressed to anyone, you lost no minutes and could continue editing or typing.Also I have the text default set to Abc but after the first sentence it keeps changing to abc so I have to pay attention and hit shift to change the setting or I have no capitalization at the beginning of sentences.I have hit the limit of drafts which can be saved, which is 20. The t404g I had 70 multi-paged texts saved and I never hit a limit. Sent messages starts deleting old texts at 30. There is 100MB of built-in memory on the phone, I hate when the manufacturer tells you what you can use it for. I have 93MB remaining memory, I should be able to save whatever I want until the memory runs out.There is a recorder to record new ringtones on the ringtone page. It records and adds the recording to the list of tones. BUT if you actually try to set the recorded tone to something, such as an alert or caller, it says the file format is not supported. Meaning it's a pretty useless tool. It is incredibly easy, however, to create a small clip in itunes and send it to the phone via bluetooth to create your own ringtones. If I'd known how easy it was I'dve never bought a ringtone.Call quality is very good. I hear people fine and they hear me. Cell phones have gotten so much better in the last few years I don't even think about call quality anymore. It seems to depend more on the network than the phone. There is also a speakerphone function which works well.The battery life is good. I don't have to charge the phone that often. Maybe once a week if I write a lot of texts or someone calls me.Has an alarm which works fine, calendar, memo pad, world time, calculator, stop watch, tip calculator and converter for measurements, temperature and currency.You can store 1000 contacts each with 4 phone numbers, an email and a fax space. You can also put them in groups and assign them pictures and ringtones.The call logs are somewhat lacking. If you call the same person 3 times in a row, it only shows the last call you made in any of the lists: outgoing and all calls. So you think maybe you imagined the other calls. But if you call someone else in between it will show you the call to person 1, the call to person 2, and the next call to person 1. It's kind of annoying to know you made calls and not have any evidence on your phone if you needed it for something. The T404G would list the people only once, but there would be a (3) next to the name indicating 3 calls were made and if you clicked on the name it would show the details for all 3 calls. So you knew you weren't going crazy.You can't see who texts are from until you open them. Which is how many of the Tracfones are.This phone also gives you the ability to use voice commands, I tested it about 5 times. 1 of the 5 times it actually did what I said. But it seems like it'd be easier just to make the calls and stuff yourself, especially the send text command, since you still have to use the keyboard to write the text anyway. And there is a browser, you can use facebook, email, etc. but I don't use the tracfone browser it costs too many minutes so I can't say how well it works. If it is like the browser I used on my Samsung Straight Talk phone it is clunky but functional. There is a music player, you can store music on a mini SD card if you have one, and you can play games (none are included) and download apps but I don't do any of that either.I guess if the text thing isn't an issue and you don't take video the r455c will be great. But if the provider doesn't matter to you I'd go with the t404g. At the moment both these phones are the same price, and both have triple minutes for life. Which for me means buying the 1500 minutes (triples to 4500 minutes) + 1 year of service for 200 dollars. You also get 10 minutes and 60 (I think) days of service for activating the phone. This is still a good phone, if I hadn't had the t404g in between the verizon straight-talk phone I used and this one I would've liked it more.UPDATE: I did get my minutes and service days transferred fairly easily on the second day when I called back.UPDATE #2: I have noticed that when I get a text and I'm not around to look at it right away I hear the text alert and press the button to check it but the screen stays black and the phone doesn't respond. Sometimes after I press the button enough times it will respond but I've had to take the battery out to get it unfrozen. If I slide the phone open instead of pressing the button it responds.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "What an improvement!", "Author": "Thom", "ReviewID": "R5UWR2Y9EEWDU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally retired my OLD Nokia Tracfone.  I've waited years for Tracfone to have a nice offering on the Verizon network since GSM coverage in our rural area is poor to non-existent.  This one has a fair feature set given reasonable and simple expectations, it's not a smart phone.  Just wanted something with a camera, basic net access and a real keyboard, the Samsung filled the bill nicely.  Got a great gal at customer service who totally knew her stuff and we sailed through the set-up and number transfer in less than 15 minutes.  It doesn't have all the latest bells & whistles, but I'm VERY happy, especially with triple minutes and .3 of a minute texts!", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "This ain't your daddy's java phone.", "Author": "Ye Olde", "ReviewID": "R36EW1LND6TH7H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had finally had enough of Sprint's $100 a month bill.  Despite their promises of only seventy bucks a month for all the data you can use, I somehow wound up spending more than the aforementioned promised price.  So, I set out in search of a prepaid alternative.  My monthlong search led me to the Samsung R455C, and I have no problem saying that for a \"basic\" phone, it delivers, and then some.  And then, it delivers some more.  It has this techie giddy, and a chunk richer every month.Now let me say that I am the guy that was coming straight off the HTC Evo 4G, the standard-setting smartphone powerhouse.  I loved the Evo, but the bill was killing me, and if I wasn't in 3G territory it bogged down to a useless crawl. I discovered that I primarily used my phone for emails and a little multimedia noodling, so I was wary of buying a non-smart prepaid phone.  (That, and the fact that my friendly neighborhood Wal-Mart had it for $79.99 instead of the more widely advertised proce of $59.99.)The R455C has all of the basic functions of a smartphone---web browsing, email and camera---but it is laid out like a traditional slider phone.  It features a slide-out QWERTY keyboard that flips the screen when you pull it out.  The good news is, the layout of the keys means that the functionality doesn't miss a beat when you pull the keyboard out.  You still have navigation arrow keys, as well as two menu keys below the sideways screen, meaning that you're never at a loss as to what to do when browsing or texting.  Its a smooth, seamless experience that grabbed me right away.  Call quality was bright, crisp, and clear, with negligible connection times.As far as the higher functions go, the browser is basic, so ya gets what ya pays for in that respect---expect to see generic texts and very little in the way of pictures.  But again, the scrolling and functionality with the keys makes it a breeze (and if you plan on doing high-powered surfing, this isn't the phone for you anyway.)  The good news is, even at 1X speeds, web pages download in relatively little time, fast enough to surprise me.  The camera is passable, but at 1.3 megapixels it is bigger than the digital camera I bought in 2004, so I can't complain about it.For me, email was the make-or-break for the phone, and luckily, it was much easier than I expected.  There is no main icon for email, but there is a shortcut through the browser menu (meaning that you have to connect to the web every time you need to check your email.)  In a few short minutes I was logged on and checking my mail.  Images are downloadable through email, but they are scaled down for viewing in the image menu, meaning that you won't get to see them in detail...but that's why you connect the phone to your PC and upload them via USB, and that, too, is a snap.And that is what has endeared me to this phone; high functionality without the bogged-down pretentiousness of a smartphone.  It does anything I want, when I want, where I want, for $45 a month, and that makes me feel smarter than I probably really am.  And if we aren't smarter than our smartphones, should we REALLY be spending so much every month just to use one?", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone, No Extras, Rotten Customer Service", "Author": "Sunshine Online", "ReviewID": "RGW8F1681R6WR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the Samsung R455C Tracfone because it uses CDMA towers, which are a majority in our area.  I love the QUERTY keyboard.  The phone looks nice, battery life is good to excellent.  For some reason when making calls, it takes a good 5 seconds before the person being called can hear me.  Meanwhile, I can hear them just fine.  Only 4 screen savers to choose from; has 1.3 camera, but does not have any photo editing capabilities; 15 ringtones to choose from; a very basic, no frills phone.While I'm basically happy with the phone, transfering my minutes and phone number was quite a hassle.  It took 5 days, 9 calls totaling almost 6 hours, lost phone number that I've had with them for 12 years, lost over half my minutes, and lost my patience and respect for Tracfone customer service.  They've always been a bit slow, but this almost had me tossing the phone out.  At one point I requested a supervisor, but was denied until 40 minutes later when they still couldn't get the phone to work.  I then was on with the supervisor for another 97 minutes.  This is my 5th phone with this company and each start up is a trial in patience.  Unfortunately, this  was the worst experience I've ever had.  I highly recommend using most of your minutes before purchasing a new phone.  Other posters have also mentioned losing half of their minutes.  Good Luck!", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very functional", "Author": "jkgolf", "ReviewID": "R1XE75YLM0NDLG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted to change to Tracfone for the savings and coverage.  This phone was not available at the stores and I was surprised Amazon carried it (They sell everything else, why not a Tracfone!).  I was tired of texting from a phone keyboard and wanted a full keyboard, this phone offers that.  Although the placement of the numbers on the keyboard are difficult to distinguish from the letters and vice versa.  The numbers share the letters on the left side of the keyboard not across the top.  The 8 looks like the B and that was something I had to get used to.  The phone works well, the setup of the features is different from my last phone and the calendar (which I use a lot) is buried in the menu.  Just something to get used to. The triple minutes is a bonus.Now getting set up with Tracfone was a nightmare!  I asked to have my old number ported, and thought it was when I activated my phone.  Come to find out I was given another number and was making calls and wondering why I was not receiving any.  I spent a half hour with a tech and got my number ported so I could receive calls and texts from friends. Then three days later, I had no phone use.  Verizon had taken back the number and I was left with a dead phone.  I spent and hour and a half with Tracfone asking for my old number back but they insisted it was gone and they could not get it back.  Then I talked to someone in management and told them I wanted my original number so I did not have to change my contact number with everyone I knew!  We went round and round for about an hour until I finally asked to cancel the deal and get my deposit back.  They found my old number and set my phone up with it.

Henry \"atlantagreg\"", "ReviewID": "R3UKKZGWGT5MOL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One of the biggest issues with prepaid phones and service is that some folks have higher expectations going into it than perhaps they should.  It's best to keep in mind that this is a sub-$100 (retail) phone, in a market where top selling cell phones can go for up to $750.00 retail.  It's on a prepaid carrier, so you cannot expect to be able to walk into a physical store and get American-based service the same way you would get at Verizon or AT&T.;  They charge rates that are half (or less) than those by the big name carriers, and piggyback their service on the big names.  They have to cut corners somehow to make a profit, so those corners are going to be phones that are not \"top of the line\", and customer service that is not always top-notch or of a level that some expect as well.So long as you realize what you're getting, what to expect, etc., and can live with it, these can still work out well for you and your family.  Here's my pro and con list for the R455C as I bought one to use as a secondary phone:PROS:1)  Pocketable - decent size to carry around.  Rounded corners make it comfortable in a pants pocket.2)  Large, bright, screen (320 x 240 resolution).3)  Good battery life.4)  Micro-SD card slot for memory expansion (suggested for photo storage) - located inside the case on the side.5)  Uses Verizon towers for service - if you get good Verizon signals in your area, this will/should work well for you.6)  Slide-out keyboard is decent (keys are a bit flat), but for this price level of phone, are good.7)  Triple minutes with each minute purchase (plus look for online codes for extra bonus minutes).8)  Web surfing is very slow and tedious. (This is NOT a 3G or even 2G phone).CONS:1)  Camera is only a so-so quality 1.3 megapixel resolution - no autofocus, no flash.  Lens easy to scratch with no case.2)  No camcorder function - cannot take video.3)  Front keys can be a bit fiddly due to phones shape for those with larger fingers.4)  Weighs a bit - you'll know it's in your pocket weight wise.5)  Headphone jack is nonstandard.6)  While charger is the same as a \"micro-usb\", not all micro-usb chargers will function with this phone - there seems to be some sort of chip perhaps in the tip of the one that comes with it that is not in all micro-usb chargers.  Some will work- others will not.LAST THOUGHTS:  This is not a smart phone - not even close.  It's a basic phone that's good for talking, texting, and picture messaging at a reasonable price, and if you're in a well covered Verizon area, should work just fine as a basic phone for your needs.  If you need something to surf the web on, Facebook and Twitter on, or regularly check emails on, you should invest in a smarter style phone like one of the basic Androids on Net10 or Straight Talk.  Plans can range from $15 per month for 200 minutes on their prepaid plan to considerably more depending on use, so there's a range of plans for everyone who's not a super power user on Tracfone.  It is again, a sub-$100 phone on a prepaid service, and that's what you're getting.

Paying 40+ dollars a month was overkill for me.  I got this phone and with Triple Minutes for Life I'll probably end up spending 40 every 3 months based on my normal usage.  The phone is decent for the price.  It doesn't feel flimsy, but not quite as rugged as my last LG slider from Verizon.  The screen size is nice, but there is not way to customize shortcuts like my old phone which is a bit of a bummer.  The keyboard layout takes some getting used to but that seems to be true with every phone these days.  Why can't they come up with a standard keyboard?  Even other Samsung phones have a different layout.The sound quality is great and the speaker for the ring tones is plenty loud.  Add a 16gb memory card and you can use it as a music player too.  The music player is a little quirky (like adding your ringtones to the shuffle all playlist), but it works.If you are a tracfone user, this is a great upgrade.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Functional Phone for Teenage Daughter", "Author": "S.

It comes with triple minutes for life and they are running a special online for 1500 miinutes at $199 so the phone and 4500 minutes cost just over $250. Based on my last year with TMobile this should last me 2 years so I am cutting my cost considerably.  The only weird thing was that for some reason they could not port my old phone number, which I originally got from Trac fone and ported to TMobile, to my new phone and get me access to the web.

The reps were very polite, but they also required me to enter huge numerical strings over-and-over into the new phone, and that didn't work either.

This resulted in a 24-hour disruption of service, where I couldn't send/receive calls (and I had no idea what was going on...).When I tried to solve the no send/receive calls problem, here is my experience with customer service today:1. First customer service representative informed me that my phone number (that I had been using for 9 months) did not belong to tracfone, and that he'd transfer me to \"Smart Talk\". I agreed, and got disconnected.2. Waited a few hours. Called back, and representative told me he was transferring me to \"Smart Talk\". I asked to speak to a manager instead. The manager had me dial a reprogramming code, and when the phone reset, I had a new phone number. The manager then had the audacity to tell me that my new phone number was the one I had all along, when my phone was first registered 9 months ago.I asked for a minute/service credit for my inconvenience, and she could only give me 30 additional minutes. No admission of error or apology.(Tracfone has perhaps the best value per minute if you go with the triple minutes and buy an internet-only massive minute card, but you get what you pay for. Customer service is the first thing to go.)Negative Aspects of Phone itself:When you look at your message history, it is easy to accidentally resend your message. The \"OK\" button turns into the \"Resend\" button, with no confirmation.Message size limit. You can't compose a longer than 160-something character text at once. The older T301G let you do this (taking up more than 1 message unit, but that was fine with me).Inability to insert a number from contacts into your text message. You have to write it down or something to send someone a number from your contact list.
