At first, I have placed an order with PVCS on October 21st for Unlocked Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 (White phone). The shipment had been in transit for 3 days and the item will be delivered the next day until I got an email from PVCS on the 3rd night apologizing that they do not have the White phone in stock only Black. When I placed the order they have 8 in stock available. I cancelled my order but I did not get credited after a week (Oct 30th). When I clicked their link on my Orders it directed me to another seller. It looked like they changed their name and bumped up the price for White phone.. I read reviews about PVCS before placing the order, I thought they have good ratings but they have proven me wrong! The 2nd time I have placed an order was with OPEN GROUP WIRELESS for the same item on Oct 25th (Black this time, for some reason White is hard to come by, but Im still hoping they will have White available). Scheduled shipment on Oct 28th BUT they shipped a Red Nikon camera coolpix s6500 instead!!! How could they messed this up? You would think they would print out the order slip and the invoice to match with the item before shipping?? I contacted the customer service so they could issue a return shipping label. I had to look for UPS drop off location, wasted my time and not to mention I can NOT get refunded until they receive the item back and will only credit it back to my bank account in 2 weeks.The 3rd time (you would think I would learn my lesson by now) I placed an order on Oct 29th with CELL-SOURCE this time for the same item. Their ads says \"available one day shipping for Prime\" member, so I placed the order. Upon check out the shipping confirmation is expected to be delivered on Thursday Oct 31st by 8pm, whatever happened to one day shipping for Prime member? so I was a little bit disappointed about this. The next morning of Oct 30th, says it's been shipped and it's in my hometown on Oct 30th at 7:16pm. I have waited, been stuck in the house all day waiting for the package to come in. It is Oct 31st and past 9pm, I still haven't received the package. I got a hold of the customer service, again, about 2 hours ago to express my frustration. I was told that the shipment is expected by Nov 2nd, and if not the item is considered as LOST. I have been having so much problems with these 3 sellers just to get the item I want. How hard is that??? The one thing I've noticed they keep on changing their names. This review will be copied and pasted to all 3 sellers...

I have had all the Notes, S4 and tried the S5 for about a week and currently have the Nexus 5.  This baby is just the thing for old guys like me who are finding it harder and harder to see tiny stuff on a screen.  I no longer have to use my Tab3 and it will be going on eBay.  I was a bit worried that it didn't have LTE, even though the signal pounds hard here in Phoenix.  However, the H+ I get all the time here seems to be only about 2 mgs slower each way on Oklaa Speed Tester.  Camera is very good too.  Remember folks, when we got our first 3mp camera and how monsterous we thought that was.  I am convinced unless you are using the camera as a professional photographer 8 mp is plenty good.  Same goes with speed.  Not 800 or 801 processor????  You mean we have to wait 4 milliseconds for a screen to change or an app to open instead of 1?  If your time is that precious to you, methinks you need to think about a lifestyle change or less coffee or something.  I am as happy and probably more happy (because of the screen size) with this than my Nexus 5, which will also be going on eBay.  My second most favorite thing is the volume.  Awesome.  Call quality is great with a LOUD speakerphone.  So, if you can live with a big screen and no LTE you have to try this magnificent device.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "It makes other big phones look small...", "Author": "Shawn C.", "ReviewID": "R1HBWC90JVQ6HW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you Samsung for filling the niche market of those who want to get biggest display they can get in a phone at reasonable Price. Mega isn't premium phone in today's standards as it uses last year's specs. It's bigger but not better. STILL, that is perfectly fine by me. I wanted bigger display. I didn't need better specs. The phone isn't slow at all, but it just isn't as fast as the today's premium phones. Still upgrade in speed in real life is not very noticeable in my opinion. As for the display, now smaller 5\" display phones are sporting 1080P Full HD display, but Mega \"only\" has 720P HD display. Can't you tell the difference in real life? I doubt it. The display looks beautiful. Period. I have Nexus 2nd gen with 1080P display with bigger 7\" display. When I compare 720P and 1080P videos on Nexus, I don't notice the difference in extra resolution in a small 7\" display. So what benefit do we gain in getting higher resolution after 720P? Hmmmm... perhaps a satisfaction in \"knowing\" that I have higher resolution although I may not \"see\" the difference. You will see the 6.3\" vs 5.5\" difference very clearly though. Bottom line, if you don't mind carrying around a big phone, you will enjoy the mega. If 6.3\" mega is simply too big, don't get it. This is a love it or hated phone. I am actually glad that they used the older specs since I can get a bigger display phone like Mega for a price much lower than the newer Note 3 or S4 with smaller display but higher resolution.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "100% recommend", "Author": "Mario B.", "ReviewID": "R2FQCZK62GQOZ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have purchased many samsung phones I can say this is one of my favorites for its design, camera, speed and size is obviously super comfortable and goes into the pocket", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Arrived as Promised!!", "Author": "40angle1", "ReviewID": "R2QVFISOBS3U3F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Samsung Galaxy Mega arrived as promised on time.

Hardy \"-SuPa23-\"", "ReviewID": "RZP2CCW1P3KRU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My intial thoughts on this phone was \"WOW! This phone is huge!\", however, this novelty soon wore off. Aside from the fact that the 6.3 inch dispaly is quite beautiful (yes even for a 720p larger display), the phone really has moderate specs as compared to the higher end phones. I've never really been the biggest fan of Samsung's TouchWhiz UI (having owned an S4, Note 2, and Note 8 tablet) mostly due to the half second lag that seems to follow swyping from screen to screen, or opening an app, but in the past I've usually been able to modify the settings enough to make it work for me. I find that I can't tweek this phone as much as I'd like to due to the fact that the developer's option is gone. I ususally found that if I turned off the animations, S voice, and other options that I normally don't use then TouchWhiz runs pretty fast, but again I can't do that here. Also I'm not sure if it's the 1.5 gig of RAM, but I find myself constantly restarting this phone due to the screen freezing. Maybe I'm just trying to do to many things at once, but why put a multitasking option into a phone if the phone can't constantly support multitasking?Again this is just my honest opinion about the Galaxy Mega 6.3. I still rated it 3 stars for 3 reasons: the size of the screen, the fact that I can sync all my notes I've taken from on my Note 8 to the phone, and the battery(3200 mAH battery) that can easily go all day without the worries of having to recharge your phone half way through the day. Overall, a moderate BIG phone that has its issues as well as its perks.

First off I just had the att version of this phone but it was lost or stolen so I really wanted to replace it but not with att so I found this one. It is not the same. Now it is very close but not the same. The pictures look very grainy and just old school. the screen is just not a clear screen. I would describe it as not being high definition verses usually seeing through high definition, you can notice. There are a couple other things like I am not seeing 4g lte anywhere on this phone.. It only picks up 4g no lte so far for me. So besides that it is a great phone all around especially for the price seeing as others are 6-700$. I love how big it is, I seriously don't need the computer or tablet anymore. Camera takes decent pics but nothing special.

Even with heavy use, watching videos, editing  videos and other activities, the battery always lasts me the whole day.The only thing I've noticed about the screen is that if you have it tilted back a lot it's kind of hard to see (compared to the s3) but that is such a minor issue. You can see it just fine in the daylight (even better than s3).Yes, you can put it in your pocket.  Several of the high school kids have challenge me.  I've had them try and even the boys who wear the skinny jeans can fit it.Bought a prepaid SIM card for tmobile at Walmart and had it up and running in no time (no special adjustments needed).
