I KNOW, I KNOW. people  reading this that know more about phones will say that it is because it is a small computer that if you play whit it using games,internet,Wi-Fi. and so on.It will deplete the life of any phone. and that is true. and i did not know till i got this phone. that is the only reason of a 4 star rating.but i love it  there is a nice fell when you grab your i1 for the fist time . for those that have been w Boost Mobile for years. this is one of the best moves the have done. introducing smart phones to the prepaid world.REMEMBER TO ALWAYS CHARGE YOUR PHONE BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP. DISABLE THE GPS,Wi-Fi, BACK ROUND DATA,AND IF POSSIBLE TURN YOUR PHONE OFF BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP WILE IT CHARGES.

Data speed is low. But...I`m using google talk, google mail without any problem. If you are not itchy guy - you may just put web address and wait for some time when page is loaded. In most cases enough to take a look at 2-3 news pages per day. Usually - chat and mail.If you do not need to take a look at different online videos and games - this unit works WELL for MOST business cases. There is no big difference between IPhone and I1 usage here.About other things...Built very well. Acceptable camera pics, not very good video, but this is not video capturing device.OS version 1.5, but covers all you need and has friendly interface.Average battery life 1-1.5 days with my settings. This is the same what others smartphones has.Control your running application, screen brightness and other options, shutdown for night and you may get up to 3 days of usage.Boost Mobile provide 35 cents per day unlimited web access, so I`m spending $15-20 per month for web and voice and I have all I need from cellular network. So I have much more reasonable solution than buying other sort of thing and spent up to in $100 monthly bills.Right now I have only one question to myself.

If you are going to do a lot of texting, be aware that the incoming text messages may be delayed for hours before you get them!And while the phone in an Android, it is slow and sluggish compared to other phones I have used. It also reboots itself a lot without warning, and it has locked up a lot when I have tried to make a phone call or text.I spent nearly two hours talking to Boost Mobile customer support trying to find out why the text messages were showing up hours after being sent to me, also they could not figure out why the phone keeps rebooting. I am hardly running any apps on it, and always clear out old messages.This phone was basically a waste of money.If you absolutely must have an Android, skip over this one, and go look at one of the other prepaid services that offer Androids now. This cellphone will leave you  frustrated, especially when it reboots in the middle of a phone conversation, or you are expecting an important response to a text message, and it shows up 5 hours after the other party sent it.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "No more Motorola for me!", "Author": "Neal M \"Nitty\"", "ReviewID": "R34DLZZNSGIWEH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a Motorola i1 with Boost Mobile. For a phone that cost over $300, I expected some level of quality. While the OS is not ideal, it works decently. I have been able to download some apps for it, but between the issues with Android Market and the older OS on the phone, there is a limitation to what you can do with it. For instance, the Compass and GPS apps will not download. I tried the continental airlines app, but could not find it on Android market when I searched Market from the phone, but saw the app on Android Market when I searched from my desktop. Strange. Also, no matter how many times I try to register with Android market, market says \"There are no mobile devices associated with this account\"Now, MOTOROLA! Three weeks after purchasing the phone, the handset speaker stopped working. That meant that I had to turn on the speakerphone or the headset in order to take a call. I tried to contact Motorola support several times but the support website is poor at best and the helpline is painful. I eventually spoke to an agent three months after my initial complaint. After more than an hour doing exactly what I had been asked to do before (all teh diagnostics including a full reset and losing all the data from my phone another time), the agent said that I had to send the phone in for repair, that he would send me an e-mail with the steps to do this and that would happen within 30minutes. That was four days ago and still no e-mail. I tried calling back. After battling through the menu options to get to speak to someone, I said \"Hello\", she said \"Hello, I am ____\" but was not clear. I asked what her name was and she hung up the phone on me. Very rude.All in all, it has been a nightmare getting Motorola service on this. I contemplated buying another motorola product (the Xoom tablet) but will NEVER buy Motorola again. It is just not worth the stress. AT the end of teh day, my phone remains unfixed. It's an expensive disaster that I carry around in shame.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "The i1 is slow, buggy, and somewhat useful", "Author": "Mandy K.", "ReviewID": "R3V3WDKSN17B7V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well my phone broke, so I was forced to upgrade. I chose the i1 after spending 10 minutes with the in store display. This was my first touch screen phone.I returned it to the Sprint store after just 12 hours. It was so horrible, I can't believe this is sold.Here is the bad:Right out of the box, the phone is so slow with typing on the keyboard. This is without any apps downloaded. Sometimes the phone keeps up with you, but then in the middle of the sentence, it lags. It doesn't catch up, just mashes random letters together so you will have to go back and fix what you typed.The screen doesn't register when you click on something. I was trying to turn off GPS, and after a few seconds, nothing happened, so I hit the check box again....then it registered both clicks and turned it back on!You can expect this slowness with just about every part of the phone, even dialing.Forget about whether or not Boost/iden is the right network for you, the phone is worse than any limitation you will have with Boost!Ok, then I tried to set up wifi. That worked, except entering the wifi password took about 3 tries b/c of the phone keyboard.Next, I tried to download an app from the Android market. You have to setup a gmail account (unless you already have one). This was painful. The phone would say \"problem with the server. Unable to access....blah blah\". I was able to go online with my wifi connection, so I knew that part was working. For some reason, the phone could not open up a new gmail account.I gave up fiddling with that.Tried to take some photos, and the quality is really bad. Then, I tried to email them, but the phone doesn't support my email service, even though my crappy $49 previous Boost phone did.  This is because the i1 hasn't had an update since the day it was released.I found this out online: Basically, motorola abandoned the phone and a lot of the games and apps aren't even compatible with this version of android, it's so old.This phone tries to do everything, but had trouble with the most basic of tasks. After 5 hours of trying to setup this phone, I gave up.I returned the i1 and got the i886. It is waaaaay faster. It has a real slide out keyboard (backlit and auto dimming) runs android, but no android market.  Much better if you type a lot on your phone.  It is a sprint nextel phone with push to talk. It is not yet available on boost. When I called boost with the imei number, they said it wasn't compatible. I liked the i886 so much, that I switched back to contract.The i886 has a very smooth fast interface. It does not have the standard motorola interface like every other iden series phone. It is a hybrid version of android.  It is a rugged spec phone. I can't wait til boost gets this phone! I will cancel my contract, pay the fee and go back to boost.  Even with the penalty, I will come out ahead b/c the boost plan is $150 cheaper than nextel per year.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "I LUV my i1", "Author": "Mila", "ReviewID": "RF7OUTCMX8OAQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this phone.

I used to use an iPhone 3G, and really became unhappy with the AT&T; service and also the phone's performance after upgrading to a recent OS (software for the phone).  Sick and tired of paying over $100 per month (that's over $1,000 per year people!), I found the Motorola i1 on Boost Mobile.I pulled the trigger one year ago and have THOROUGHLY enjoyed my experience with this phone and also with Boost Mobile in general.  $50 per month is a great price for unlimited everything, and the phone's service is just good (if not more consistent) than AT&T;'s service for my previous phone, the iPhone.It is true that this phone is noticeably behind the iPhone in \"coolness\" in many of the small features, but it does everything I need it to.  I can download a ton of apps, sync with my corporate Outlook email account, have a secondary gmail account, run the Facebook app, watch YouTube videos (thanks to a recent Boost mobile software update), take pictures & video, etc.  Seriously, I love this phone.  It's very rugged and can stand up to a lot of wear and tear.  Plus the cost savings of the Boost service make it a home-run to me.

I have to say that I am happy with my Motorola i1.([...])PROS:1- General: I used to have a BB before, and I thought it was the best thing.  However, looking at the applications and utilities that this phone has (in addition to the extended memory to up to 32GB) this is the best phone I ever had.  I am still getting used to the touch screen keyboard, but I found out that laying the phone horizontally and inclined, really helps a lot.  In the almost full year that we had this phone we have experienced many issues, but mainly because the kids play with the phone while locked.  Therefore, if you have this phone and kids, I suggest that you do not lock the phone while they are using it.  We have learned how to reset it to factory settings, because it has locked on me at least twice.2- Platform: The Android 1.5 platform might not be the best, still it gives you access of many of the applications that are very important, gives you extra performance, and tools that you will learn to love.  Motorola has no plans to update the software at this time (per the website and Customer Service).  However, the applications on the Market for this phone are great!  For example, you have free antivirus applications (Lookout, etc), Bank applications (Bank of America, PNC, etc.), games, productivity (Quickoffice, etc.), among gadgets that are cool (Google Talk, Google Sky, Gmail, eMail, Gasbuddy, etc.).  Therefore, you do not need to have the latest phone to have a cool phone.3- Physical: The phone itself is slim and has very little weight.  What really sold me out in the physical aspect is its MIL-STD-810 qualification.  I work in different environments and this type of weather and situations I can find them at any moment.  A regular phone has to be in a protected casing to withstand some of the things that this phone can do out of the box.  However, I did bought a hard cover to provide further protection (Premium Black Rubberized Snap-On Cover Hard Case Cell Phone Protector for Motorola i1 [Accessory Export Brand Packaging).  The shock part of the standard refers that the phone can survive a fall of at least 5' with no problems.  You might think this is nothing compared to the stories of iPhone surviving parachutes falls, but having toddlers and kids around phones this is priceless.  Especially when they want to use it, while drinking juice or milk.  In more than one occasion I had \"saved\" the phone from my kids, but just a quick paper towel do the trick.  DO NOT THINK YOU CAN SWIM WITH IT OR PUT IT IN A BUCKET OF WATER!  That is not part of the standard.  However, if you are running under the rain to your car or from one place to another, it should hold some.4- Service: Having the Motorola i1 in the Boost Mobile Company (and Nextel for the walkie-talkie feature) gives you the liberty of having no plan (chains) with the company.  Right now, with their shrinkage plan, you can end up paying just $35 dollars a month for unlimited service.  Where we can get that with an Android Phone and unlimited data usage?  Now, you can always add extras to the phone.  They offer now insurance (yes insurance) for the phones for $5.  If you like making calls to another countries, they offer international call plans starting at $5 (see website for more details).  The walkie-talkie feature is the best after texting.  I used it often, but be mindful of what you say since the phones goes into speakerphone mode automatically.  This is great if you do not have the need to make a whole phone call, or cannot type in the touch screen for a text and goes directly to the phone.5- Memory: Memory plays a medium part for me.  Although I have not been able to get a 32GB micro-SD, I am looking for one at a fair price.  The moment I do finf it, this will become my MP3-Movie player for everyday use.  There is no further need to carry my iPod, which can stay at the car or at home, where fidelity is necessary.  Nevertheless, for listening to music at a doctor's office, or waiting for the bus, this is the best solution.  In addition, you can have Pandora, Spotify (Motorola's Music Service), Slacker Radio, You Tube and other apps installed in your phone if you don't want to use the 32GB card.  Convenient, right?6- Software: Motorola has one software tool called Motorola Media Link that allows communication between the phone and a computer to transfer music.  Well, Windows Media Player does the same, so use WPM.  It will treat the phone as a memory card, and you can synchronize your songs into a playlist to fill as much memory as you want.  Always leave space for your pictures and your applications, but with a 4GB, you can have half for music and half for apps with a large amount of space left.CONS:1- POWER: When it comes to power consumption this phone is not that good.  If you use the web, video, camera, radio, Facebook (yes it has Facebook APP), then the charge will be short.Suggestions: Like someone else said, charge your phone overnight, and mind the usage unless you connect to the charger.  To increase the life of the battery, I suggest that you turn off the until you need it the WI-FI, Bluetooth, and automatic Sync for apps (Google, Facebook, email, etc). In addition, decrease the brightness of the screen and reduce the screen time-out.  Furthermore, you can install a task killer application (there is one app call Android Task Killer) which will allow you to kill unwanted apps running in the background (similar to a PC task manager feature) to consume less power and internal phone memory.  Finally, if you are able, I suggest you get at least one more spare battery and have it with you charged.  In case the phone turns off because you have been using it a long time without charging, the extra battery is a saver.2- Speed: If you are a \"speed junkie\" and want to have a fast phone that has everything readily available at the microsecond, this is NOT YOUR PHONE.  Do not expect to have a very high speed in the phone itself compared to a newer phone.Suggestions: You can increase the speed of your web browsing (a very significant amount) if you are near a wireless connection and using your WI-FI access.  Having less apps running in the background also increases the speed of the phone, so once again I suggest a task killer application.  Finally, do not go crazy opening multiple windows and trying to go to many pages \"at once.\"  Give time to the phone to work, and you will see that it will respond.3- Shared Frequency: Let us say that you want to make a call, but you want to surf the web at the same time.  You will not be able to do this in this phone.  Even the walkie-talkie feature will alert you if you or the other party is available due to network use.Suggestions: Many applications allow you to use the phone by receiving calls.  Make sure that the settings of the apps, and the phone itself, it says that it allows phone calls to come through.  Once again, having a task killer application will allow you to control those running in the background and turn them off to avoid communication problems.  A PLUS OF HAVING A WI-FI in the phone: if you can connect to a wireless network with your WI-FI you can increase the productivity and communication of the phone. You will be able to make calls while usinf the WI-FI.4- Memory: Internal memory of the phone is only 256MB.  That is enough to install applications on it, but not all the ones in the Market.  Therefore, you have to select at times the ones you really need to use versus all of the ones that you want.  Remember that the applications share the internal memory with the emails you get (Email, Gmail, etc).Suggestions: Check your cache for applications from time to time.  Some applications give you the ability to delete cache.  However, I found that turning the phone on and off, from time to time helps you clean the cache.  That, paired with a task killer application does the trick for me to have at least an average range of 70-90MB available all the time. That is even with apps installed in the phone. To put music in your phone, you need the external card (micro-SD).  The phone comes with one, but it you want more you can extend to 32GB, which is roughly the same size as a regular iPhone nowadays.  Neat, right?5- Software: The CONS with software are the drivers needed for connecting the phone to a PC.  The phone does not have a CD in the box and when you connect your PC to the phone, you might not get the right driver.Suggestion: Go directly to the Motorola website and download the latest driver for the phone or use their tool to find the right one.  This will allow you to not only synchronize the music but also charge your phone from your computer.  Hence, this is another idea to battle the problem with the short life of the charge in your phone.  Additionally, you could find a way to tether your phone into your PC for wireless access.  However, I do not have information about it.SUMMARYAlthough you might see some concerning CONS with the phone, I have found ways to minimize them and avoid having problems. The suggestions really help me out, but it all depends on your use of the phone. Many applications from the Market will help you use this phone in many ways and harness its potential.  If you are looking for a phone that gives you the benefits of a regular cell phone while at the same time is a Smartphone, stop looking no more.

Most certainly NOT on the level of Apple's iPhone. This phone is made with substandard parts that break easy. Plus, Motorola tries to find any reason to refuse to repair the phone. For example, my phone broke while in my backpack. It was new. one week old. The little pressure on the phone from the stuff in my bag cracked something under the screen. You would never know it was broken. Everything on the outside looked new with no scratches. iPhone would never break like this.This Motorola Android phone is one cheap piece of crap. Plus, many of the Google android apps had viruses or they did not WORK properly....I am going after Motorola legally for faulty design/manufacturing/parts.

Whats unacceptable though is shipping the i1 w/ an obsolete OS, not supporting it, not being honest about not supporting it, and c*ckblocking the community from doing it themselves because ur evil crap motoroloa. long story short, motorola hates you, your money-sheep to them, and they make crap. buy iphone, buy htc, buy samsung. dont buy motorola, they suck. the good? at leats there is a pre pay smartphone, so they get one star, they also get 1 star because i cant go lower. i know i sound unreliable, but uber tech nerd here says: motorola hardware and software is obsolete garbage, and the only reason they still exist is because they make deals like with boost so people like me have NO CHOICE. your time will come craperola, oh you wait.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "it's ok!", "Author": "PHIL", "ReviewID": "R2XNALDRZYREM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was expecting a lot more of this phone.
