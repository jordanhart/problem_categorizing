The instructions provided do not offer ANY information hardly.2. The top left slot in the back of the phone is for your SD Card, the two in the upper right are SIM1 and SIM2. NOTE: THIS PHONE ACCEPTS STANDARD SIM CARDS ONLY! IF YOU HAVE A MICRO OR NANO SIM, YOU CAN BUY AN ADAPTER TO USE YOUR MICRO OR NANO SIM BUT FIT THE STANDARD SLOT FOR LIKE .99 ON EBAY OR AMAZON. Nobody told me this and since the instructions offered little help, I was stuck trying to figure out how to put my micro sim in it. lol.Other than that, this phone is a great product! Very well built! User friendly! It's my perfect smartphone. I have always loved the look of the iphone but the ability to customize my OS. I have always said if Iphone and Android got together and had a baby it would be my perfect phone, and here it is....what's more...at like a 5th of the price! I highly recommend! Also, it doesn't say this, but my phone came with Android 4.0.3 installed along with the Google Play store and other Google apps, something users buying non-brand android products always worry about!Hope this helps!", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks like an Iphone 4 and does FUNCTION", "Author": "Adolfo Matos", "ReviewID": "R2JCZGL7D9STW6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "\"You get what you pay for\"It looks just like an an Iphone 4 and even came with a case, which was a surprise. It came with two batteries and has dual sim card . I bought it as a gift and only for that.  The camera is low quality on both sides. The screens brightness is minimal. The calling quality is pretty good and the speaker phone compares to store bought phones. If you want to ease yourself into the Iphone trend , this ancient Chinese secret will give you that facade.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "J Bailey", "ReviewID": "R2QQAKWAZGGH7S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:- compact size- works with Tmobile SIM cards (voice & text, can't confirm 3G data)- my light usage resulted in 2 days of battery life.Cons:- bulky charger/converter combo- occasional freezes when exiting app in landscape mode to the Home screen.- Android ICS 3 soft Navigation buttons not present (Hopefully I haven't missed a setting to enable them). Recent apps is the button I needed so I installed \"Recent Apps Quick Button\" app and placed icon in the Favorites tray.- No default notifications for missed calls/texts when phone is sleeping. Installed NoLED app to show icons on screen.- availabilty of accessories. It takes a lot of trial & error with iphone 4 stuff.The phone arrived within a week. After a few weeks of use this phone has been perfect for me.My mobile phone usage pattern is mainly voice and text. I rarely use data, so no need for web browsing, email, content streaming, GPS, camera etc. I didn't need a big GPS screen type phone.My previous phone was Motorola flip phone with Tmobile Pay As You Go by the minute plan.I needed a phone for voice and more texting, so I went with this as my first Android phone.The included manual doesn't provide much information. Based on comments from others I supplemented it with the ICS 4.0 user guide for the Galaxy Nexus from Google.I inserted my Tmobile SIM in one of the slots and it worked right away.When the phone is powered on it generates a log entry that a second SIM is not detected.I have now converted to Tmobile monthly Pay As You Go plan. I also added a G.Skill 16GB MicroSDHC class 6 card.The screen size may be small but it is OK for me. I have it set to the Extra large font so I can read it without my glasses.I carry the phone easily in my front pant pocket. I just have to make sure the phone is locked first. If it isn't, it will be on a screen 4 menus deep when I next unlock it.The USB charger is very bulky. It is the international charger with dual round plugs. The phone includes a converter to dual spaded plugs. I can plug it into a wall plug but the charger keeps slipping out of the converter. It also takes up a lot of room.I now have it plugged into a power strip so the charger fits into the converter vertically.Phone was rooted using the TPSparkyRoot procedure.Most of the apps I have installed were based on recommendations from friends. I have loaded the following successfully so far:Droidwall - firewall programTitanium Backup Pro -Comodo Mobile Security - anti-virus and malware scanner.Comodo Battery Saver - provides quick access to turning phone features on/off.Recent Apps Quick Button - provides quick access to the open Apps list.NoLED - takes a lot of tweaking to get the settings correct but it is worth it. When a notification is active it increases battery drain.Swype Beta - replacement keyboard. No more pecking at the keyboard.TouchPal Contacts - dialer which allows you to assign gestures to your contacts.There are a lot of comments on the amazon uk site worth taking a look at.The phone will occasionally freeze for about 10 secs when transitioning from an app in landscape mode to the Home screen in potrait mode. It runs fine once this is done. It hasn't happened under any other circumstance.I am having trouble finding a slim case for this phone.I have tried one of the bumper cases from china. It fit OK around the phone but the depth front to back was too small.I have an aluminium case on order. The rear of the case with the screws will face forward, but hopefully it fits.I bought some front/back screen protectors for an iphone 4. They front one was about 1mm too narrow on the width and the back camera opening is a little too high.Someone on Amazon UK spoke of modifying a flip case, but I am not at that point yet.The Wireless-G reception is not as good as my laptop. I am not able to compare it to other phones or tablets.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "ITS BEEN OVER A MONTH", "Author": "Kimberly", "ReviewID": "R19FIMTY3ZGDJ4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone the beginning of JULY it is now the middle of AUGUST.

It does work good, sound and function are fine. I was hoping to get 3G speeds, but finally read a older post that this phone are for European 3G. The channels are not the same in the US. Don't buy if you think it will work here. My Straight Talk T-Mobile sims works great, but only Edge speeds. I have a AT&T; sims that is 3G and still no 3G. Straight Talk (Walmart) and at T-Mobile tell me that I have to have a data plan because this is a smart phone. Why pay for something you can get.It has froze up at least 10 times, but nothing bad. The only other thing that I don't understand is the numbers that I add to contacts. I can type in 7045558900 and it adds (704)555-8900. You can make a call on this, but when I select message I have to change to 704-555-8900. I've read everything and can not find how to stop this.I'm going to next time I re-activate my Straight Talk, just use the unlimited talk, text and data for $30. Maybe if I don't tell what kind of phone that I have, they want know. There are MTK 6*** phones that listed 4G LTE compatibly and this may work in the US. If I can use the $30 plan I'll still be happy. In two months with this phone, I have never needed 3G. The wifi works for anything that I want to get from Google Play or the web.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving my new phone", "Author": "johnie m. thomas", "ReviewID": "R2U3GNCS83W0CA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my new phone I got it in way less time than stated, it was package very secure I almost had trouble getting in the box it was package so tight.

The Volume buttons are on the right instead of the left, so you need to use iphone bumpers because the cases wont fit right.

When i received it about a week early it was a version of the iPhone 5 instead, which was a nice surprise. I was so excited when i got it, it was a really cool phone. But there were some issues. First, the reception was terrible and i would randomly loose signal and it wouldn't allow me to be on the internet. Also, most of the phone was in Chinese and i was not able to change it but changing the language setting. Siri Doesn't work. I ended up sending the phone back because as soon as i let it die it wouldn't charge. I really liked the phone itself and wouldn't have returned it if it would've charged while turned off.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "iphoney", "Author": "james", "ReviewID": "R1PBXDGFNSBPWO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "iphone  look alike .good ass cell, not iphone but just as good if not beater ,iphone two much money and 2 sim.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mine Works", "Author": "2cen", "ReviewID": "RKIYZ5CFKDYKZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Two Months with the phone and I've learned to double click to go to desktop, hover over to delete a message, hold the button to bring up menus, hold the start button or pull the battery to revive a freeze (though I haven't experienced this yet).I believe if you want 3G you'll have to go with tmobile or att and not the cheap piggy-backers. I get edge (enhanced 2G)with my cheap network. The data is slow(maybe even throttled)but messaging is fine,SMS is fine.My buddys with older android os's are jealous of ice cream sandwich, although they can surf the internet 10xs faster, but they're also paying 2xs as much.Mine came with a chinese browser but with play store. So I was able to load english chrome or whatever, using play store.Not sure why gps is so bad (slow network?) but it rarely works. No built in compass either so night sky will be useless.All that being said I'm pretty happy with what the phone does do well.
