It was not fully compatible with Cingular's voice mail system.  For some reason the voicemail indicator light would not register when there was a message.  When it did work it would not register when the message had been deleted. According to both Nokia and Cingular the software for the phone is not updated yet for this Cingular feature as the phone is primarily made for European and Asian 3G and GSM networks.", "Date": "December 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great phone but not At&T; USA compatible!", "Author": "Dave Nat \"dave_nat\"", "ReviewID": "R27WL50VYCOBX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As another reviewer noted, the listed description of this phone is wrong, read down to the detailed specs and you will see. It is not 850mhz compatible, actually it is 900mhz, so it will not work with AT&T; in North America. For that, you'll need to go with the Nokia 6120 or 6300, which are similar in features and do actually offer 850/1900mhz.", "Date": "October 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "WRONG INFORMATION", "Author": "Antonio H.

It is so for two main reasons: for one, no one and I mean no one that has used this phone (even just once) forgets how perfect the keys are to use and touch. Very well designed and as mentioned in another review, navigation and text messaging with these keys is wonderful. The second reason is that the system in itself is pretty quick (access from one folder to another, opening apps, loading sms, etc), unlike most nokia models which are constantly criticized for carrying symbian software that is too slow. The camera is just a plus, it's nothing special, there is no flash and the only way to appreciate the 2 megapixels of the camera is to take a picture in conditions with plenty, and I mean plenty, of sunlight, otherwise the quality of the photos are pretty average.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nokia 6233 cell phone, is a phone for all seasons.", "Author": "Nashat Mostafa \"Consumer Electronics Consulta...", "ReviewID": "RXPBZVUC3MFF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Whether it's for business or pleasure, the Nokia 6233 phone gives you the best of both worlds.
