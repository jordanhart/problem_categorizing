I bought this phone because the free phone that AT&T; gave me had almost no signal everywhere that I went (including my house) and the battery life depleted very quickly. So I was just looking for a cheap replacement until my contract is up and I can switch carriers. This phone does exactly what I want it to do and NOTHING more (no camera, no micro SD slot, nothing fancy). I don't have a data plan currently so I can't say anything about browsing the web. But this phone does have a very consistently strong signal and now I don't drop anymore phone calls. This phone is fairly easy to text with but, the buttons feel kind of cheap and there are a lot of sub menus ( and I do mean very many sub menus). So all in all, it was a solid purchase and I feel like I got my money's worth. Not the most convenient phone ever but a good backup to keep around in case I drop a better phone into a puddle or something.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "its ok", "Author": "The Pearl", "ReviewID": "RJXVP40M2O3B6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I knew it was a used product, and it works very well, many thanks for the item.I will stongly recomend this Phone.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect for busy people", "Author": "Alex Souther", "ReviewID": "R1XYHMEPYEXETI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So this phone came out a while ago (in phone years)Long story short, the battery contacts wonked out on my newer blackberry, and I needed a phone ASAP so I ordered this one.It is incredible. The size is perfect as compared to thinner phones, because I can rest it between my ear and my shoulder when having a phone conversation. The qwerty keyboard provides excellent tactile and auditory feedback, and I can type with ease on it. The screen has a hard plastic over it that I would never imagine breaking through normal wear and tear. The side has a scroll wheel which makes navigation easy and efficient (no rubbing the little box or clicking just next to a link anymore)The biggest selling point would be the battery life, though. I bought this phone USED and the battery lasted on a full charge for 2 days. Note that I used the internet, receive and send text messages, and make phone calls practically all day between work and school. I still had a good chunk of battery left before I put it on the charger. I cannot recall owning a phone with such a good battery life in my phone-using days (I have owned a samsung t209, a nokia flip phone, samsung gravity I and II, g1, sidekick 4g, and the latest curve)", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Whats up lol", "Author": "1908", "ReviewID": "R33S6U194GC6O3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone dosent have a camra. they dont tell yoy everything about there phones so be cearfule if you like this phone.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Includes OEM battery, battery cover, data cable, holster, and wall charger\nBluetooth enabled\nSpeakerphone\nSim card not included\nPC Sync, email, web browser, text messaging", "Name": "RIM Blackberry 8700g T-Mobile Bluetooth Unlocked GSM QWERTY Smartphone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Z471PPWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000FIBEIO"}}
