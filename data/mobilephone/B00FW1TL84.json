The WiFi in the AWE is more sensitive, always picking up more access points than the Optimus sitting side by side. The GPS in the AWE locks in quickly and has no problem picking up 21 satellites while the phone is inside my house. The Optimus sitting next to the AWE sees only 8 satellites.The AWE has front and rear cameras and both are able to record 720p HD video. The front camera has fixed focus while the rear one has auto focus. I have found that to get good pictures with the rear camera it is important to hold the phone as steady as possible. The rear camera seems to do frame averaging under low light conditions and that guarantees fuzziness if the phone is moving around even slightly.The only real disappointment so far is that tethering via WiFi and USB do not seem to be supported.out of the box. There is an app that makes USB tethering possible, but I haven't found a way to make WiFi tethering work yet.Another minor issue is that when the display is in auto brightness mode it looks darker than I would like.

It was 7 months old at the time.  I was upgrading from a Kyocera loft so I was moving into the world of touchscreen smart phones.The first thing that irked me about the Wildfire S was the lack of storage for apps (only 156 mbs of space).  That's it.  So I purchased a 16 GB mini sd card, but many apps cannot be transferred onto it.  Also, the HTC had a ton of things that could not be uninstalled which came with the phone, most notably, twitter.  When the battery stopped lasting for even a half a day with moderate use, I needed an upgrade.Went through black Friday without buying a phone and then somehow I fell upon the ZTE Awe on Amazon.  I checked the specs and they were heads and tails better than the HTC.  I purchased the phone from a second hand seller, brand-new, for only  $52 total with shipping included.I've been playing with the phone for the past few hours and it is extremely easy to navigate.  Apps can be added and removed with the greatest of ease and with about 2 GB of space for apps, I'll never run out of room.  The screen is a perfect 4 inches which is an upgrade from my old 3.2\" screen, but not too big that it feels uncomfortable in your pocket.The speakers are very loud for the phone.  I played some youtube videos and some music and had to turn the volume down since it was too loud.UPDATE:The battery is very good.  I used the phone heavily throughout the day and still was at about 50% when I recharged it before bed.There is one downside.  The camera, albeit 5mp which is pretty good, doesn't take great pictures.  If you don't hold the camera perfectly still it will be blurry.  If someone is walking by, they will be blurry.The 3G is fast.  With ZERO bars, the 3G kicked in and did everything I needed to do.  Grant it, I live in Columbus, Ohio, so it's a major city, but the fact is the 3G worked fine.If you're like me and just want a fast, responsive, easy to use phone with plenty of storage space for a lot of fun apps, then get this phone.  The dual-core processor makes it run remarkably effortlessly.I'm not sure why it's so inexpensive, but I don't think I'll need an upgrade any time soon.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice phone!", "Author": "Sang Walker", "ReviewID": "R194ULE4STWH2X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very good phone! internet seems to work great, quality on it is great! music player is clear. runs on jellybean. touch screen responds perfectly good. battery life is ok.But the only thing that i dont like is the camera.. even though its a 5mp camera, the quality sucks!If you like to use phones to take pics i wouldnt recommend this phone but other than that i really would recommend it!", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Smartphone that I Have Owned So Far!", "Author": "ATrustworthyReviewer", "ReviewID": "R2J9KZZGUHO6P4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I  was in need of a phone and wanted to replace my LG Optimus Elite phone. The Awe ZTE N800 phone is the perfect combination of all qualities that I liked in  LG Optimus V phone and the Optimus Elite with  additional features that the newer higher priced phones provide, but at a cheaper price. I had my eye on this phone after seeing YouTube reviews and reading about its capabilities. I was willing to by it at  full price, however I was blessed to buy  this phone for $20 on Black Friday from Target.It has a front facing camera and back camera both of which work very well. I am able to move apps and download directly to my micro SD card . This was something that I couldn't do on my Optimus Elite. I can also watch movies which is a feature that my Optimus V couldn't which is why I say that it provides me with the features of my previous phones and offers more. Apps and music download quicker since  it has a 1.2 GHz processor. Since it runs on the Android 4.1 Jelly Bean platform ,I am able to use apps that were not compatible with my old phone. The Awe ZTE is the perfect phone to upgrade from the two phones that I mentioned before without breaking the bank.  I love the size of the phone, it is not humongous nor is it too small.  The battery life lasts longer than my previous phones and I use it the same way. It also chargers fairly quick.I was surprised by the quality and features of this phone  for its list price. I totally recommend this phone to anyone who needs a smartphone , It is the best one that I have owned. The only con is that it is hard to find a case for this phone in an actual store so if you buy one ,don't forget to buy a case online too. That is a minor setback to a great product. I never heard of the company that makes it but I certainly do now. Please don't hesitate to buy this phone, you will not regret it.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Enjoying this phone", "Author": "Crystal \"kavanava\"", "ReviewID": "RDUI1GCZ3RERX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am one of those grandfathered VM $25 a month users. When I moved back home I decided to change from Verizon and give VM a try and I haven't looked back. I purchased the LG Optimus V and it was a great phone when I purchased it but like most electronics a few years down the line and it's getting too slow for the current technology. I went looking for a new phone and luckily VM had this phone on sale cheaper than Amazon. It seems some got the phone as cheap as $20 on Black Friday at Target. I can't say I got it that low, but I got a great price and it's gone up since I purchased at VM plus I got it delivered for free to my door in a few days. In my mind the extra money was worth not having to drive to Target, find parking and wait in line.Anyway back to the phone. I have never used ZTE before and I must say I am impressed. I put in an 8GB mini SD card into it. I loaded on over 300 MP3s onto the SD card via USB and when I played them the speaker on the phone wowed me. Usually the speakers on these small electronics don't produce much of a sound. The phone also had no problem automatically finding the MP3s in the folder I named Music on the SD card (I used the phone to erase the card when I first inserted it as I figured this would leave the card clean and formatted). I have Norton 360 so I am able to load a mobile version on to the phone. I did a scan and with the app downloads, MP3s, etc. it took under 40 seconds. Pretty speedy. Since I am still on 3G network it appears I get to keep my $25 a month plan. I was considering purchasing a LG that was 3G and 4G capable also on sale, but I wasn't sure if I would keep my $25 a month fee and after reading the description except for the 4G capability this ZTE phone was fairly similar and was less than half the cost. Of course, not as fast as 4G for loading web pages, but a big improvement over my old phone.The phone is slim and lightweight, but the screen is comfortable. People seem to think it's somewhat flimsy, but I have a feeling it stand up fairly well and I plan to get a case and screen protector for it so unless it takes a fall on some rocks it should be fine. I haven't used the 5MP camera and video. I'm sure it takes a fair picture, but I don't expect it will be up to iPhone standards. I don't use my phone much for those purposes anyway. The phone was easy to use and I had no problems setting it up or figuring out how to use it. I loaded as many of the downloaded apps, pictures, and music on to the SD card as possible and there is still room on the card so everything is running smoothly and these days many are using the cloud or streaming live off the Internet so there isn't need for tons of storage for many users.And now for the annoyances, which are minor ones so far. When I restart or turn off the power and start up (like to do that when there is an update to downloaded software) the sound level from the \"welcome screen\" is quite loud and annoying. There does not appear to be a way to adjust this except by turning off the sound. I'm used to being able to press any button to bring up the lock screen, but on the ZTE Awe only the power button on the top of the phone will bring up the lock screen. Typically the phones these days come crammed with so many apps taking up precious memory. And some of the apps I do use such as the calculator weren't to my liking so I downloaded a different one. The phone gives you the option to disable some of the apps which I did and so far I haven't had any problems, but of course they are still on the phone. Battery life on any phone is an issue. The more you keep the screen on, etc. the more you drain power, but it's adequate and I can plug the phone in the car charger to keep it going. If you're into heavy duty games I doubt this phone will do it for you. I don't play games on my phone so it's not a problem for me.This phone is a winner and given what I paid for it I had to give it 5 stars for value. In a few years I will no doubt have to replace it and bite the bullet for a more expensive plan so I am very satisfied I didn't have to pay hundreds of dollars that will essentially be down the drain and I get to keep my $25 a month plan which also more than makes up for the little extra I paid for the phone over the $20 others paid at Target. I got this fabulous Christmas present for myself and I'm so happy I did. It's a Merry Christmas for me indeed!", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awe Some Value", "Author": "Gavin T. Davidson", "ReviewID": "R29Q3XSYB19A5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this phone (as well as a few more) up on Black Friday for the $20 offer price.I had no intention of using the phone with Virgin, only as a small portable wifi device that could slip into my pocket.I did not have any real expectations for this phone but had previously owned a ZTE F102 candy bar style phone that was very reasonably priced ($22), reliable and well made.The build quality of the ZTE Awe is very acceptable, sure, it's not a premium quality phone but you will not be looking at some obviously cheap Chinese low quality product. It's very nicely put together and does not feel cheap or budget priced in my hands, of course YMMV depending on your expectations and comparisons.The battery life is very good and I run a number of WiFi based calling applications for communication, including MagicJack, Skype & Viber.Viber is good for messaging on this phone but for some unknown reason, I cannot get the audio functions to work for calls.Skype is generally good but I find that incoming calls usually drop then I have to call the party back, which, is usually successful. Video calls work very well indeed with a good Wifi signal too.I've found that since Microsoft took over Skype, the program is a bit less reliable on the Android platform than it used to be.I tend to run older versions of Skype as a result, with better consistency but there are still various quirks.I'm not necessarlily blaming the ZTE Awe for these problems, as I can get similar results on other Android devices.The camera function is fine for taking candid snaps but don't expect too much from it. It even comes with a separate dedicated camera button but I have to say I don't use this nearly as much as I thought I might.If you decide to purchase this ZTE Awe to use only as a wifi calling device, you will be constantly nagged to activate the phone each time it is powered up. You can turn this off by choosing Airplane mode in the settings. Don't forget to turn Airplane mode off again if you want to use GPS functions, as it won't lock on to any satellites.I've been using MapFactor: GPS Navigation as a free offline application. I can't say I'm particularly impressed with the program but it does function without a data connection, which can be very handy indeed if you are in a bit of a jam!I've also used this phone as a remote webcam over the home network and it produced very acceptable images for keeping an eye on the neighbourhood.For $20, I couldn't expect more to be honest, if there was one thing that would have made this phone even better, that would have been if it was a GSM model phone that could be used overseas.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really like this droid phone", "Author": "eternitybound", "ReviewID": "R1IGCKRWJ8IA8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace a defunct HTC One V that only lasted 16 months before behaving so erratically that it had to be replaced.

It is faster, lighter, easier to maneuver and battery life appears good so far.  I am very impressed with this Virgin Mobile offering.

It is very responsive (only occasionally laggy), operates smoothly, and basically does what it's supposed to.I love using the GPS with Google Maps. Love using Google Drive...I find myself taking more notes in meetings or in a lecture setting. I am a heavy user of Google Drive, so Android was a no brainer for me and this phone has been a big help for doing things on the fly.Other things I like using the phone for: YouVersion Bible, kindle, amazon, youtube, documenting work-related items, sharing photos, trying to find places, comparing pricing...basically using it as a smart phone. The selling point for the Awe is the fact that, while lacking in certain high quality features, it is actually feature-rich and is incredibly affordable.Battery life is good. I typically leave 3G off most of the day and flip it on as-needed. This gives me 3-4 days of use before recharging. If you leave the 3G on and use it regularly, you'll need to charge it at least once a day.Footprint: I think the phone is an ideal size. Slips in my pocket unnoticed and doesn't drag down clothing, but still comfortable enough for reading.3G: not the fastest...browsing online pages will be a test of patience...but wifi is great.Internal memory: lacking.Camera: just ok. Flash provides inconsistent results. I do like how you can immediately edit/crop then upload/email/text.Apps: basically function correctly. Facebook tends to stop connecting to the internet and I'm forced to reboot. Manually force stopping FB app doesn't correct the problem. It would be nice to be able to force stop all apps at once, maybe there is a way, but I haven't found it...so you have to either force stop each app or reboot.Build quality: light, but everything is tight adequately strong.

It's fast, has 2 gigs of internal memory for apps, has a 4 inch screen, and has a front-facing camera.  Also, it's voice-to-text is almost FLAWLESS!  I don't have Netfilx, but I'm sure if one did have Netflix and used it on this phone, they'd be pretty pleased.

It is thinish, feels good in the hand and responds well.Four weeks after purchase the phone began to drop the mobile network connection every 10 seconds and then reconnect.  It would do this and play a chime until it died.  My return window for Amazon was 30 days so I had to go through the RMA process.  Once you can find the contact information for the warranty you get connected to a call center in India.  The phone prompt scripts are technically in English but sometimes so badly written you have no idea what the prompt wants you to do.  Once you make it through to support their first answer is always the same: \"Contact the mobile service provider to fix the phone\".  I have a 'pay as you go' contract with Virgin which at the time I had stopped paying for as ....well I had no working phone.  Needless to say - IF you can get through to a support person for Virgin they have no interest in helping you with a broken phone that you did not buy from them when you are no longer even paying for their service (I certainly can't blame them).On the plus side when I got my result from Virgin Mobile I called back ZTE support and relatively easily got an RMA from the rep with instructions on how to mail the phone to a repair center in Texas.  Shipping to the vendor cost me $16 bucks.  The repair was accomplished quickly (about a week) and they shipped it back to me in the same packaging I sent them with no note, invoice or anything.  I assumed they fixed it? as I was able to reactivate it and and three days later it seems to still be working.SO...nice phone, pretty cheap, if it breaks you are in for a world of hurt.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "Claudia Brown", "ReviewID": "RX9IHOCYOEBJP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "average phone works for what I need only and soo is my son's phone also, we like it  battery runs out all the time.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "ZTE Awe", "Author": "Tammie Taylor", "ReviewID": "R23TER2DX2BB97", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone exceeds expectations!

I got mine on ebay for 50 bucks. Black friday was 20 bucks. For this kind of price I think it's a steal. It's not your high end 4g lte with dual processing with 8 mp camera, but it gets the job done. Camera is decent 5 mp. Speed is good enough for me. When you start running multiple apps at once that's where it start to slow and lag a little. People have reported the phone restarting on its own occasionally. This has happened to me a few times and it's most likely due to the fact that I was running too many apps at once. I play deer hunter on this phone and it runs good enough. I get occasional lag spikes but It doesn't affect me too much. Rumor has it it does have a dual core. Idk about that really. Overall, this is a decent phone and for under 100$ it's worth every penny.Update: 3/24/14The reviews about the phone breaking down after a few months are true. The phone likes to restart on its own for no particular reason. sometimes it fails at restarting so i have to take the battery out and restart it that way. I try watching movies on this phone and it just looks like a mosquito net covering the screen for some reason.
