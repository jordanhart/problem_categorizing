{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Upgraded from a LG 840g and I'm not looking back.", "Author": "PepperPot", "ReviewID": "RJ6K59K9883MZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My prior phone was the LG 840g. Although the LG served its purpose providing a mp3 player, a better GUI experience, easier texting and a touch screen in comparison to my Motorola flip phone that preceded it, I was growing a bit weary of the limited software available and was anxiously waiting for tracfone to offer an android phone. I also admit I have been obsessed with the sony smartwatch and its not compatible with any Java tracfone. Anyhow, after 4 days I can say I am more than satisfied and, no, it has nothing to do with the watch. I didn't buy it yet. The most difficult issue I had was transferring my contacts from my old phone. Eventually I just transferred them phone to phone using bluetooth which was super easy after I figured it out. I went to the tracfone website to complete the transfer myself and it was easy. The transfer itself took about an half hour after I completed everything.Things I like:1) Multitasking - you can browse the web, play a game or access an application while you're on a call. Smart phone users might read this and say \"welcome to 2011\". However for tracfone users transitioning to android, its a mind blower.2) Text messaging arrangement - No more going back and forth from your outbox to inbox just to see a full conversation. It's rite there on one screen. Your texts are on the right. The recipients response is on the left.3) Triple Minutes - nothing new to LG 800 and LG 840g users BUT you get triple minutes for calls, text and web each. In other words 20 min are actually 180 min divided 3 ways. Have fun with it while you can. Someone is going to realize they made a mistake and change it. Just a Note; my LG 840 automatically utilized wifi when I was in range for the web. This phone will use your minutes if you don't turn off Mobile data under settings -----> data usage. Thanks to C. Overhulser for pointing this out.4) Phone looks good and feels solid. Looks much better in person if that matters to you.5) No issues connecting to Wifi.6) Google Play - the software available on android is more than enough for anyone. I downloaded a free call and text app that I can use to make calls over wifi instead of using the minutes I paid for. That means I can do what all my friends love me for, which is listen to their relationship issues. Lucky me . . . I think.7) Bigger screen - not in comparison to the current phones on the market but enough over most tracfones.Things that I'm so so on:1) The learning curve if you are transitioning to Android, could be a bit challenging. I went through hours trying to figure out how to transfer my contacts. At first, when I tried to connect the phones via bluetooth it didn't pick up. Under Your centura bluetooth menu select \"only visible to paired devices\". That switches it to pick up devices that are not paired. For some reason none of the tutorials I found on the web mentions transferring contacts phone to phone via bluetooth. Save yourself the trouble and pair the phones.2) I don't like the tracfone app. Unlike the LG, its not real-time. You basically refresh the app through the web. No web, no update. It was automatic on the LG. No internet needed. The widget is also huge, but considering the info it provides I understand the size.3) My 3g signal has only reached 2 bars, but honestly, I'm not even sure what that means and if it relates to me specifically.4) The psychological transition - how do I explain this? Tracfone users like myself see a phone for what it is - a phone. The extra bells and whistles are a convenience, not a necessity.  The smarter the phone the more personal it tends to be. For example, I synch'd this phone to my email which automatically makes this phone almost as important as my wallet. For me, its a bit uncomfortable. Of course you don't have to synch your email or any of your accounts but the whole idea behind upgrading to an android is to take advantage of what a smart phone has to offer. That can be a good thing and a bad thing. It's something \"dumb phone\" users like myself never had to worry about. It basically means your phone may contain sensitive information which makes it more than just a tool to make calls.  In other words password protect it.If you're on the fence I say give it a try. Overall, I'm happy with this phone. The price was not even a question for me. It's worth it. I took advantage of a deal on ebay that offered 200 minutes which broke down to 600 minutes each. It takes what the LG 840g does to a smarter level. I would also urge anyone looking over reviews or writing reviews to take a second to distinguish if the faults are a software or a phone issue. For example, although it was resolved, there was talk there was no way to view your remaining minutes. I can't hold samsung responsible. That is an android/tracfone issue. If you are new to android and your issue is software related, it will be an issue regardless of the phone you buy if its on android.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it", "Author": "Daisy", "ReviewID": "R2IWTYXJPSJS9E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I saw a lot of people complaining transferring the current phone number and service through customer service. I did it by myself through website and followed steps exactly. No problem at all. After two hours it's done. I got my 1010 minutes, 1010 min text, and 1010 megabyte. It's very nice to have text and data megabyte. When I logged in using my existing GMAIL account, since I have another android phone used same GMAIL account, amazingly it will install and download all the settings and applications matching my old smart phone. I didn't do anything, but I saw my contacts, my games(candy crush, soduku,...etc)and my applications(whatsapp, skype, wechat,...etc.) are already on the new phone. Of course some is missing, I need to reinstall again. I saw one people from HSN site complaining all his data megabytes are gone, it may be caused by this auto updates, so make sure you use WIFI when you set up the phone. For me, I had the data usage disabled and wifi enabled all the time.For this new phone, if you send out a short text message, it will deduct one minute. Not like LG840, it only deduct 1/3 minute. If you make a phone call, the timer is started when it rings. If you hang up early, you will see your time in your call log already and feel like it has used your minutes, but it may not. I called one friend which has longer waiting ring and hung up early, it didn't charge me. But if I call the friend with 3 waiting ring, and I hung up after 2 rings, I got charged. you can check your balance from the phone. Click on the web browser, the first item in the list is for balance. It will use your 3G data if you connect to 3G. Every time you check your balance from your phone, you will receive a text message showing the left balance, this is nice.My son played the game on my phone, and he said the phone is nice, he likes it too.One thing I don't like is the signal strength. I got the phone, no signal bar and \"x\" on signal bar which means no service around. I have to go upstairs (showing one bar)to make a phone call to have it activated. After activated, I saw the \"x\" has gone but still no signal bar when I am in downstairs. I was very upset. But somehow my phone still rings, I can call and answer the phone. I went outside driving around, the signal bar is always weaker than LG840. I was told the phone uses verizon network, it suppose should be better.I just found out if you use your left hand to hold the cell phone, it will weaken your signal reception. It can drop 1-2 bars comparing if you use your right hand. And when I connected my phone to PC to copy music to it, in the middle of transferring, I got a text message which caused rest transferring error. I have to set the phone to airplane mode to complete my copy.I bought a ZTE valet tracfone and used it for one week now. Comparing the two, my recommendation is buy Samsung Galaxy Centura.1. Samsung Galaxy Centura's screen color is better.2. Samsung Galaxy Centura screen responding is better.3. Samsung Galaxy Centura's signal strength is better(both wifi and mobile network). I stay outside of my house, samsung is still connected to my wifi, but ZTE is not. Make sure using your right hand to hold the phone.Found out another interesting thing. This is about MMS message. If you want to send and receive MMS message, you have to enable mobile data plan. If you only have WIFI enabled, you can't send/receive MMS message. Your received MMS message will tell you \"can't download\".", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I am not so lucky as the other user to have 100% data transfer", "Author": "Giamseko", "ReviewID": "R3QCALJQ7RBPKD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I transfer my old Tracfone to this Samsung Centura on Oct 2, 2013.

I use Tracfone since 2007.My suggestion to use this phone economically, install Google voice and GrooVe IP Lite for voice call, LINE app for international message and voice, I can use these apps to make call on WiFi before I even activate the phone.

Tracfone smart phone service is affordable, more value-added than traditional Tracfone service. will give 5 stars based on the proCon : no prepaid menu, need to go online to check remaining minutes, text and data.

Past phones availiable were pulled from a time capsule at best. This centura is an entry smart phone. But quality, performance, and price far surpass the $120.00 going rate. The screen resolution is good, and touch interface is excellent for this price point. Processing is adequate for most tasks. Phone performance feels snappy navigating menus and apps. The phone itself feels solid, and looks better in person then the pictures show. Battery life is fair, but as expected. This samsung phone is leaps and bounds better then anything Tracfone has offered before. You cannot underestimate the value here. I disregard reviews of people comparing this phone with others that are 5 times as much money, and with monthly services that cost at minimum 4 times as much. This phone and service is the best value to users who keep their cell phone usage and texts to a minimum.

I like it, it works well, a good solid phone.  The problem is, there isn't an airtime balance ticker like every other tracfone. There isn't any way to check your airtime on the phone itself.  That being said, it's not that hard to go to tracfone.com, type in your phone number, and get a free text seconds later with your balance.  I just did it on the phones browser, took about 30 seconds total. Kind of a pain but I'll take it to have a smart phone with no service contract.  I would recommend this phone, would be 5 stars if not for the airtime business.Update: there is an app that displays your balances so I upped my rating to 5 star", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Didn't Want to Like It", "Author": "sickphil71", "ReviewID": "R2I6CIVKXWKFDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I HATE smartphones in general.  I'm very much a use-my-cellphone-to-make-voice-calls-only-when-I-need-to type of guy.  I don't text.  I don't surf or watch movies on a phone.However, I'm now a convert.  This little thing ROCKS!!!  I learned what I've been missing.  The touch screen is fast and responsive.  It has a gyro that orients the picture when you tilt the phone.  The camera is surprisingly good for both stills and video (and good sound, to boot!).  Granted, it will never replace my nice \"prosumer\" Canon equipment, but that's not the point.  If you want to capture extemporaneous events, you've got something that's not horrible.  File transfer of said images is a snap.Back to the screen (I'm sorry, I'm wandering, I know.): it is clear, sharp and surprisingly easy on the eyes--even for watching YouTube videos.  However, at my age, I doubt I'd ever watch movies on it.  The colors and detail are fine, but when I watch a movie, I want to use my big, glorious HD TV.  Anyway, the screen is fine for the purpose of reading books, recipes and--if you must--texts.  With headphones, the sound is surprisingly robust and you can use Bluetooth if you don't like headphone wires.Even without the headset, BTW, the phone itself is very clear--no dropped calls.  Yeah, imagine that--I use it for calls.  Speakerphone is very good and the virtual number pad is responsive.  I'll admit it took awhile for me and my less-than-dainty fingers to grow accustomed to it, but now I'm a pro.Obviously, this is a prepaid phone, but it's a really good value.  You get a HUGE number of minutes and texts to begin with, plus a considerable amount of data.  I got 1200 minutes/texts/MB of data when I initially purchased the phone in November and I have yet to use more than 300 minutes and almost none of the data.  How is this possible?  Well, that would be because although you get 3G data service with this phone, you also get wi-fi, which means you can get your data for free any time you have access to a wi-fi signal--which I have in my home, at work, at Panera's, McDonald's, etc., so I haven't really had to use my 3G.  On the very rare occasions when I've used it, it's pretty quick.  Granted, I haven't been playing video games online, but why would I?There is one thing I HATE about this phone which, ironically, will be something that most people love.  Since it's an Android phone, it automatically synched my phone to my G-mail account.  I despise when devices do this automatically, because it basically creates an open door to that account so that if someone uses or steals my phone, they automatically have access to it.  Furthermore, it's not easy to disable this link.  I don't want everything hooked up to everything else.  I don't like all my eggs in one basket.  If I wanted that, I'd buy one of those Windows phones (ha, ha--yeah, I know.  Funny).Other than that, this has been a GREAT purchase.  Oh, and the battery life is good, too.

I know many of you can't decide which phone to get when upgrading tracfone service to a smart phone.  I hope I make your decision easier than my was.I first bought the ZTE, used it for a few days then returned it for the Samsung and have been using that for a couple of days.To make a long story shorter, the SAMSUNG is the better choice.I loved this phone from the second I put it in my hand.  It feels great, looks great, and equals or out performs the ZTE.Comparisons:The ZTE does not light up the 3 lowest buttons on the front of your phone unless it is very dark out.  This is a real negative.The Samsung is more intuitive in both set up and use.  It just feels right, where the ZTE doesn't.Both perform at about the same rate of speed, but the Wifi is better on the samsung.  In fact,  the range on the ZTE is poor.Both versions of android work smooth.Many more accessories are available for the Samsung.Price:  There is an e-bay site which sells the Samsung for $109 (-5$ for using Paypal I think)  Anyway it cost me $104...no shipping or taxes and arrived in TWO days.In summation....BUY THE SAMSUNG and you won't be sorry.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy Upgrade from Samsung S390G Tracfone", "Author": "VaMos", "ReviewID": "R1984YHAWTWQ70", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over all, this Samsung Centura SA S738C phone is an excellent upgrade from the Samsung S390G.  This CDMA smart phone provides easy and intuitive navigation through a touch screen instead of a track ball and the menus are logically organized.  The user interface is very similar to other Samsung products I own: the Galaxy Tab 3 tablet and the Samsung GT-S6102 GSM smart phone.  The large minute balance on the old phone transferred easily and quickly (in about 10 minutes) to the new phone on the Tracfone Website.  Since many other reviewers had trouble with this transfer, I would like to make few comments on this process to help other buyers.  First, make sure the battery is installed and the new phone is fully charged.  Second, do not de-activate your old phone.  You cannot transfer the service from inactive phone.  Third, go to the Tracfone Website and select the \"Activate/Reactivate Phone\" option from the main menu.  In the activation menu, select \"Transfer my number and service from one Tracfone to another.\"  Fourth, follow the instructions CAREFULLY to enter the codes from the old phone in response to each request.  If all goes well, the system will instruct you to wait till your old phone stops working and enter a confirmation code on your new phone to complete the activation and transfer process.  The system also issues a \"Ticket Number\" that you can use later, should you need to speak with a service rep.  The exact balance of 5208 talk minutes transferred as new balances for ALL three types of charges.  The new balances were 5208 minutes talk, 5208 text messages, and 5208 MB of data.  You can monitor your balance using the TracFone My Account or Tracfone Data Usage apps available in the Google Play Store.I was able to access my contacts on Google by logging on my existing Gmail account.  Be sure to turn your WiFi on and data usage off when you first turn on the phone so that the phone uses WiFi to install any available updates rather than your precious data balance.  So far I am very happy with this phone and it is great improvement over the old clumsy S390G.Added Note: after several weeks, I did not encounter the problem of the unit resetting time by -6 or +6 hrs, mentioned by other reviewers.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Centura so that I could accept credit card payments using the Square Up", "Author": "W.

Overhulser", "ReviewID": "RQ2HOP8PWHOX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I should say I have other Tracfones but this is my 1st android phone so still on a learning curve.  The phone is great, WiFi, used with airtime data turned off is fantastic, connects easily and flawlessly and uses no minutes.  Bluetooth connects to both my vehicles' Motorola IHF1000 handsfree speakerphone units, reliably and flawlessly.  Phone has acceptable signal strength even in my weak signal home area - the calls still connect and come through loud and clear in both directions, both on the phone and through the bluetooth hands free units. This is a great improvement over my previous Tracfones which ran on T-Mobil in my area.  I find the 'save numbers to contacts' and 'contacts setup' a little convoluted, maybe because I'm not used to it.  Can't find a speed dial or favorites contacts to put my Home or other close contacts into.  Maybe it's there but I can't find it.  I haven't yet figured out how to get my contacts info from my old, non-android phone onto this new phone without having to re enter everything. Overall the phone is great and a significant improvement over previous Tracfones. I can do a lot of the same stuff I can do on the Kindle Fire HD plus a phone too. Next I will research and order phone case, SD card and car holder.Now to the Tracfone service...  I'm setting this phone up for my wife and ultimately will transfer her existing AT+T number to this phone but initially I'm setting this up as new service with new number.  Once it's working, to her satisfaction, I'll transfer the AT+T number.  The Tracfone saga...  I activated on-line and applied a 60 min pin.  Called *22890 and phone seemed to activate but no airtime applied. Waited 2 hours, still no airtime. It took 4 calls, 1st call I was told to be patient and wait awhile - waited 12 hours. 2nd call, no resolution, after 30 min I ran out of time at lunch and had to hang up. 3rd call, connected to supervisor who had to set it up manually and got it working but when I checked the airtime on-line found only 60 (1X) minutes. 4th call, I was told my phone did not allow for 3X minutes. Many 'Wait a moment while I check further' episodes. After insisting repeatedly, I was connected to techsupport who again told me that according to their records, my phone was not set up to have 3X minutes. I told her to check their web site and read the description. I also read her the 3X description off the box. Finally after 'checking further' repeatedly, determined that she could fix the phone to allow for 3X minutes and update my original airtime to 3X. So after 4 calls and 2+ hours on the phone, seems to be all better with 3X on the airtime/text/data balance. Next test will be when I add another airtime card and look for 3X.  The phone finally is working with triple minutes applied.

All 3 of us highly recommend this purchase.  We first charged them.  Then we set up WIFI, remember to turn off DATA in the settings.  We used the phones for a week to set up email and check out all of the features of the phone.  Remember these features work without signing up for TracFone.  So if you ever upgrade your phone you can still use WIFI and the camera any time like a mini tablet. My daughter set up all 3 phones on line.  Did not talk to any representivies from TracFone.  Read all directions very carefully!!!  Maybe a couple of times.  In just a few hours all 3 were activated.  We are all TracFone customers for a long time.  She had no trouble bringing over our phone #'s, Years mine ends in 2017,  and 2 of us  had  6000 minutes each and they transfered to 6000 minutes, 6000 text, and 6000 data.  Plus the promotional minutes, text and data.  Also we all had gmail accounts and she had no trouble getting our $25 Google Play money.  I bought covers and screen protectors from Amazon!!  Remember to go to the Google Play store to get the TracFone app to keep track of you minutes, text and data.  A widget goes on your home page.Husband's phone is for emergency use for phone calls and WI FI in the house for email and games.Daughter uses hers in addition to her Virgin Mobil phone.  We live in a very rural area and even the police carry phones from different carriers for coverage.  She uses hers where the other phone won't cover and when she is out of minutes.I love mine because it is on the Verizon towers. I carry mine 24-7 in case of an emergency.  I have a very bad back!!!  I baby sit at one of my daughter's home. My old tracfone would not get coverage in the home, down the street.  I would have to travel about 1/4 mile before the phone woud work.  Very dangerous not having a way to get help.  Daughter does not have a home phone only an expensive Verizon phone.  This Samsung Galaxy Centura gets coverage everywhere the other phone did not and where it did get coverage!!!  A life saving feature.  And I love the fact it hooks right up to the WI FI in all of my families homes.  I just put in the code one time.  Also I have hot mail and when I look at my emails while resting my back in bed it updates my email on my laptop!!!  Wonderful!!!

AN UPDATE: At first I thought I would not be able to do things like download cool ringtones, then I found the free app \"Fusion\". This app will let you use all kinds of music and downloadable stuff as ringtones.  I've been able to \"personalize\" people, like my husband with the Indiana Jones theme, etc... Really FUN!  Right now my main small problem with this phone is I can't figure out how to turn off certain sounds individually, like email notifications.  Unless I remember to switch off \"Wi-Fi\" every night, the phone will wake me up with notification alerts whenever I get an email, and running an online business, I get bunches.  I did try someones suggestion of making default notifications \"silent\", but it still sounds for every email received. There may have been a way to do it on that first \"set-up\", but not sure. Bottom line, this is a great phone and I am super happy with it, I am even MORE happy with TracFone.  I should be fine with a $10 a month plan as this phone triples everything; a 120 minute card becomes 360...and now I can take credit cards at trade shows using a free Square reader I ordered online.  That was the main purpose for getting this phone.  I've already run a sale, and this phone works great to do it. As you may already know, TracFone buys services through the big cell phone companies.  Which server is determined by which phone. This is a Verizon phone, so if you get a good signal with Verizon, you will get a signal with this phone. We live in a mountainous area where Verizon is the only strong server.  There are websites that will tell you which TracFones use which servers.  Takes a bit of research.  And a last bit of advise, if you buy this phone, as soon as you activate it, go into \"system settings\", then \"data usage\" and switch off \"mobile data\".  I used up half my data in the first couple days before figuring this out.

I have never used a smart phone, but I have no complaints about this one, other than that it occasionally drops the wifi and has to be restarted. Turning off 3G when you don't need it greatly extends the battery life and ensures that you won't accidentally use data when you don't intend to. This phone doesn't display minutes or your service end date, as others have mentioned, but if you go to the Google Play store, there's an app you can download that will fetch that info from the Tracfone web site.When I went to add a 1-year card to this phone, I learned that Tracfone is not honoring promotional codes for smart phones. If you are upgrading from an existing triple-minute phone, I suggest that you add any air time and promotional code to your old phone before activating the new one, then transfer the number and minutes over. Also, if you're using more than 100 minutes/month, consider buying a 400-minute 1-year card on their web site and taking advantage of the offer to buy an extra 400 (i.e., 1200) minutes for $25 before you transfer service to the new phone. You can't get this offer if you add minutes from a store-bought card, and I don't know whether you can get it if you add minutes directly from the phone (I never tried to). I also don't know if they offer this option with a smart phone, as they have different offers for different types of phones.The other, more important issue that I didn't understand when I bought the phone (since this smart phone program is brand new) is that when you buy minutes for a smart phone, they go into 3 \"buckets.\" For example, a 400-minute card would give you 1200 minutes of talk, 1200 texts, and 1.2 GB of data. In a way, this is an advantage - you're getting 3 services for the same money. However, a problem arises if you use a lot more of one service than another, since you can't fill the \"buckets\" individually. For example, you could be forced to buy more minutes for all 3 buckets after sending/receiving only 1200 texts, whereas on a regular Tracfone, you could have sent up to 4000 texts for the same money.P.S. I just noticed on the inside of the phone packaging that you can add data to the smart phones separately from other minutes - but not texts. 2 GB costs $50 (does not triple).", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fourth TracFone, First \"smart phone\"", "Author": "Sutton Reid", "ReviewID": "R2HGRFG8KIA1CD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After buying this phone and using/testing for a week, I bought a second one for my wife. Everything you see here applies to both phones. I also bought a 32G micro SD card for each phone.1) Bluetooth features work well with Honda HandsFreeLink. (2012 Odyssey EX)2) Voice recognition works very well, although severe limitations due to the language, not the device. For example, the phone doesn't always discern the difference between \"to\", \"too\", and \"2\". Neither do I.3) Screen keyboard works well, although I'm thinking of getting a stylus.4) Camera is good enough for casual snapshots, especially if you have an emergency need, such as a fender bender.5) MapFactor \"Navigator\" installs on the optional SD Card and gives you extensive offline mapping and GPS capability, while not impacting the amount of internal storage. By \"offline\", I mean that if you are in the middle of nowhere with no phone service and no wifi, the GPS and mapping work.This phone is my fourth TracFone, all with the same number. The following technique successfully transferred my number and minutes.1) If you don't already have an online account with TracFone, create one and register your current phone.2) Add your new phone to your account and check the \"I don't have a phone number and will get one later\" box when you add it.3) Click on \"activate\" for your new phone and you should get an option that says \"transfer your existing phone number and minutes\".4) Follow the instructions carefully.Bear in mind that what worked for my phone may not work for yours, so if you have any doubts, call TracFone.The biggest con so far is that downloading specific maps is extremely slow.MapFactor Navigator tips:1) Install your micro SD card before installing. You will then get a prompt to choose where to install it. I tried installing it first and then moving it after installing the SD card. I ended up uninstalling, deleting the navigator folder and reinstalling from scratch.2) Go to MapFactor's website and install the free version onto your desktop/laptop computer. You can then more easily download all of the maps that you want, even if it means leaving your computer on overnight. I'm not saying that this will always work, but so far, it has for me. Once you have the maps downloaded to your desktop/laptop, you just copy the files over. Make sure that Navigator is not running on your phone.

Stewart \"Occasional Amazon Shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R2YV0QDP8RD0U1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best phone that I have ever got for Tracfone. It is a true Android smartphone. The phone is solid, touch screen very responsive, and performance is good, even with many apps running. GPS seems to be flawless with this phone; it shows me in my house, almost dead center of the parameter, and keeping GPS on all the time does not seem to consume any excess battery; just make sure you close any associated apps when not in use, such as Maps. The voice recognition search functions also seem to work well. The camera is ok too, although all pics that I take show a focal length of 2.79, so not sure if the phone has an autofocus or not, but pics are way better than my previous phone (LG840). The camera does have a zoom function, but I think that is standard these days.To start with, activation was a breeze. For the first time I was able to perform the activation solely via Tracfone's website. I purchased two of these phones, and the entire transfer process took about 45 minutes for each, one of which was on Christmas day. Both phone transfers were from current Tracfone phones, so I am not sure how long a port will take from a different provider. Both of my old phones also continued to work until the new phones were activated, so they have greatly improved this process. For some reason I also received 600 bonus minutes/texts/MBs on each phone; still not sure why but I'll take it. I do like the idea of having three separate balances. Although you do use an entire unit per text, you can use apps like Facebook Chat to chat all day for just a few MB of data usage. Also stay on a Wi-Fi connection whenever possible. If you manage your minutes and data usage, you can get a lot out of this phone - I am still on the family plan and pay an average of 8$/month per phone.The battery life is ok, but you will need to charge it every day - that's just android for you. You can cut down on battery usage by monitoring your apps and background data. For instance, Google Hangouts seems to be a big power hog. Also, restricting background data on certain apps helps with data usage as well.Being a true android, it does not have your standard Tracfone software, which I like, so you will have to download the Tracfone app to check your balances and stuff. The phone also does not do a lot natively, such as file manager, PDF reader, or notepad, but guess what?? - There are apps for all that. You can basically customize the phone to meet your needs. I definitely recommend linking your Google account with this phone, which you do on setup, so if you do not have one, get one. This makes installing apps and backing up settings much easier. I also recommend using the Google+ app and installing SMS Backup; this will allow all of your pics and messages to be backed up to your Google account, so if you ever have to do a factory refresh, you will get it all back. I also have to add that I have not had the problem previously reported with the time zone changing. The time is accurate every time I pick up the phone. Perhaps there was a previous update/fix for this.Bottom line - this phone is awesome. I liked my LG840 and LG800 models, but they were outdated. I have been a Tracfone user for well over 10 years, and have had many phones, but I finally feel that I am up to date with the rest of the world.

I figure that I can buy a One Year Card for $100 and get all the phone minutes, texts, and data I need for a year. Most of my data needs are fulfilled when I'm on WiFi, which don't count against your balance. If you run low on data, data only cards are available. Best place to buy phone, text and data is through the tracfone website as they often offer bonuses. Search for bonus codes. Watch for offers to supersize your purchase at checkout. Don't be fooled by those saying that Tracfone has raised the cost of texts with their android phones. Yes, a text now costs a full unit, but you get triple Phone minutes and triple text units when you redeem a card. That's actually a better deal than before.Sure there are fancier and maybe faster phones, but I've found android apps for my Centura that do, just as well,the things I do on my IPAD.If you need cases or screen protectors, order them from Amazon or EBAY you won't find much in stores.

So far, so good.I am far from a tech newbie - I've had and currently have countless mobile devices (tablets, mini's, ipod touches, etc). But I am one of those people who really does not feel that I *need* a phone or *need* to be text-enabled. However, having an \"all in one\" device can be useful, so I decided to take the plunge when HSN had its incredible Fall offer (phone, $25 play, 200 minutes that triple, 90 day service, car charger, case).I read countless horror stories from others about problems encountered transferring a number and service to this particular phone. After reading and reflecting on this for a while, I made the simple decision to get a new number with this phone and leave my existing phone in-place until I was confident that everything was OK.As others have mentioned, there are a few steps you really must do before activating this phone.(1) Fully charge it. Mine took a couple hours, but I read materials that it could take upwards of 5 hours. Leave it plugged  in overnight.(2) Turn off data, enable wifi, hook up your Google account, and begin your system & Google updates. It takes a while.(3) Add antivirus protection. I chose Kaspersky for Android, and a 30-day free trial is available online.(4) Change system settings to prevent non-market apps to be downloaded. Added protection. BTW, Kaspersky AV is a non-market app.(5) Get a service card with minutes. The 200 minutes, 90 day card is a good choice & came with the HSN offer.(6) Log onto tracfone and activate the phone - a number will be assigned (unlike before when you could choose from available numbers).(7) Get comfortable with the phone & make certain that it is fully functioning BEFORE moving over your existing minutes & service.For me, my existing phone had 2 weeks of remaining service but 1600 minutes. A call was required to move over those minutes and days (thereby disabling the phone). I had the 2 phones for 10 days before I felt comfortable in making the switch.BTW - Google the 1-800 number in Miami to bypass the off-shore csr script-readers.

I bought this for my daughter (13yo) to replace a \"slider\" phone. Yes she's spoiled, but not as much as the kids with the latest iPhone...  She already has an android tablet running 4.0.3 and the interface is consistent, so there has been very little learning curve. She mostly uses it for texting but has also installed a few apps from the GooglePlay store and they all seem to work fine.We use Tracfone exclusively for our cell phone service (4 phones total). It has good and bad points, but with our limited usage the cost savings are substantial so we've stuck with it for several years now. The integration of the Centura into the Tracfone network is seemless. In fact, it seems like it works better for simple voice than the phone I currently carry: my phone has a dead zone in much of our house, but the new Centura seems to work fine. To tell the truth I haven't noticed that the Centura is a Tracfone except the silly logo at the top and the app to check the minutes usage (it comes with free \"triple minutes\").As for minutes usage, there really hasn't been much. Like most smartphones, the Centura uses wifi instead of a cellular connection when its available, so things like texting are \"free\". Since my daughter texts a lot while sitting around the house where we have wifi, I may actually save some money (yeah right).It's a great phone, but it doesn't have all the Gucci features of the best android phones so far (super high res camera, rear facing camera, LED flash and large screen). It works great, runs android 4.0 and cost less than a Franklin so I gave it 5 stars.On a related note: I bought a ZTE Valet for my wife recently (another Tracfone android offering), and while its an impressive phone, so far I don't \"like it\" as much. It does have an LED flash for the camera, but it doesn't support WMA music format (which our entire library is in) and there are some other things that just don't seem to work as snappy.

If you are not interested in learning the clever things an Android smartphone can do, well, maybe you'll be happier with a good feature-phone.As others have noted, the Galaxy Centura is the best phone TracFone has ever offered.  However, it is far from perfect.  For the most part it is an old design and it appears Samsung has elected to save a few pennies by using inferior components in the radios.  If you compare the specs, you'll find that the Centura is almost a twin of the Apple iPhone 3G of approximately five years ago.  Same screen size and resolution.  Roughly the same data capability.  Impressive then.  Not so impressive now.Some positives:Standard micro-USB connector works with your other cables and chargers.Responsive touch screen.Small power adapter, with industry-standard USB and micro-USB connectors.Android.Access to wonderful apps in the Google Play Store.Some negatives:Radios are crippled.  Wifi only works on 2.4 Ghz band.  No 5.0 Ghz.  Link speed limited to 65 Mbps.  Essentially 802.11b/g, not 802.11n.  May not automatically re-connect if wifi SSID is not being broadcast.  Speedtest reports down/up rates of 15/4.5 Mbps using wifi.  That's about half of what I get on my Xoom tablet.  Speedtest reports down/up rates of 1.5/.7 Mbps using cellular.  The 3G speeds are terrible, but at least there is a connection.  For comparison, my Xoom on cellular 4G LTE gets 24/12 Mbps.There is no front-facing camera.  Thus, no video chat.The rear camera is low quality, is almost useless with barcode readers, and has no flash.Many common Android 4.x settings are missing.  For example, there is no portable hotspot or tethering.Bottom Line:  TracFone should have offered this phone years ago.

In my opinion, it is currently one of the best true smartphones you can get with a prepaid plan costing <$10/month.  You should also consider the lesser known ZTE Valet TracFone. It has similar specs and is ~$25 cheaper.  These phones are a lot better than the pseudo-smart Java phones like the LG800G that TracFone sells.This phone is great for tech savvy users who occasionally need a cell phone and web access, and do not want to waste their money for an unlimited plan.  If you need an unlimited plan, Walmart has the same phone under Straight Talk for ~$45/month.  TracFone allows you to refill data separately if you use more web than voice.I own an old iPod Touch and a Samsung Tab 2 Android tablet so the setup was pretty straightforward.  If you are computer challenged, this phone is probably not for you unless you get your kids to set it up for you and maintain it.Remember, this phone cost a lot less than the full feature smartphones but you do get less too.  It runs slower because it only has a QualComm Snapdragon S1 MSM7625A 800MHz single core A7 processor with only 396MB of usable RAM and 2.75GB of usable flash.  I ran the Quadrant performance benchmark and it got a 1555 vs. my Tab 2 of 3138.  Screen gestures and simple apps work smoothly though.The phone uses the Verizon 3G CDMA network versus AT&T; GSM.  So depending on where you live, this may be better or worst for you. I got 0 bars in the house with GSM.  Now I get 2 bars with CDMA.  Note: TracFone uses C in the model number for CDMA and G for GSM.Issues-The power button is on the upper right opposite to the volume button on the left.  It is easy to accidentally change the volume.-The display size is only 3.5 inches but fine except for the tiny cell signal bars.  It is hard to read in sunlight even at max brightness.-The phone speaker for your ear is not loud enough at times even at max, and the speakerphone's speaker faces rearward so you lose a lot of volume.-When using the phone, it does not display the numbers after you connect so you need to press an icon to get it when responding to number inputs.-I could not get a MP4 video to play.-It has a tough time reading QR codes unless they are large.-The menu-home-back buttons are not lit until you touch them so they are hidden at night.-This phone does have a GPS satellite receiver. I was able to use the GPS Test app to verify. Turn off wifi and synching in the power control widget to help it lock-in the first time.-It vibrates when you turn the phone on/off.  No option to shut that off.-Voicemail does not give you an option to delete for some odd reason.-There is no widget to end apps like the Tab 2 to save your battery and prevent apps from monitoring you but apps are available to handle this.-If you use a lot of data over a short period on the 3G network, the software keeps displaying a high mobile \"data usage warning\" that you can't reset.TracFone seems to be still working out the bugs in handling smartphones on their websites, apps, etc.  The phone does not display your minutes and service end date automatically like the old TracFones.  You need to go to Tracfone's website, input your phone # (and  the last 4 digits of your phone's serial number if you not doing it on your phone) to get the info.  It displays the info on the website, and sends a text message to your phone.Very few apps are preloaded.  You would think TracFone would preload their own app and widget that gives you the minutes and service period but you have to download it yourself.

The simple reason?  I don't need to make or receive a lot of phone calls when I'm \"on the go\"...most of the time family/friends can reach me at home or at work!That being said, I've never really been opposed to owning a cellphone (either a simple flip phone or a more advanced smartphone); it's just that up until now I've never been able to justify the cost of the many unlimited plans vs. the little benefit they'd be for me.I decided to look a bit further into TracFone back in mid-December after seeing an in-store display and was extremely pleased to learn that I DON'T need to spend a fortune each month with Verizon Wireless!  After reading a number of reviews on this particular Samsung model, I decided to take the plunge.  I bought a 120-minute, 90-day airtime card (which gives you triple:  360 minutes, 360 texts and 360 MB mobile data) for $30...so for $10/month I have 2 hours of phone use and more texts and mobile data than I really need (make sure you turn OFF mobile data unless you need it; I usually use wi-fi for FREE when I'm in my house).Seriously, I can check my e-mails on the phone, surf the web, play (a few) apps...the TracFone app/widget is something I'd recommend you download and put on your home screen so that you can easily see how many days/minutes/etc you have left.  Oh, and did I mention that unused minutes/texts/data ROLL OVER?  Just another great thing about going with the TracFone service as opposed to the unlimited plans offered by Net 10, for instance (TracFone also owns Net 10).I've been EXTREMELY happy with the phone thusfar.  In the past 3 weeks I've used about 2.5GB via free wi-fi use but only a miniscule 40MB of mobile data.  (For example, if I wanted to check the score of NFL games when I was out, I'd turn on the mobile data since wi-fi wasn't available, open up the CBS Sports app that I'd downloaded, check the scores quickly, and then turn mobile data off.  Same routine with e-mail:  turn on mobile data, open e-mail and read my messages, then turn mobile data off.  When data is used sparingly, you won't need to buy additional data from TracFone.  Believe me.)The only negative I've seen thusfar is that the built-in rear-facing camera's picture quality is just OK, but that's not a major concern.  If I'm going somewhere important, I'm bringing along my normal camera for picture-taking.  Phone calls on this phone (in central NJ) have been clear, and the e-mail/web/app functions have been a nice convenience.In conclusion, I very much recommend this phone to low-use cellphone users who are like me:  people who don't always \"need\" to be in touch during every waking moment with everyone they know.  For the price of a C-note (to buy the phone on Amazon) and for $10/month, I'm all set.  I also bought the gel skin offered via Amazon; it's an excellent idea because the phone is very slippery without the skin on and can easily fall out of your pocket/hand/etc.I'd rather pay $10/month than the $60, $80 or even $100 that many others pay each month for their phones' plans.  Those monthly savings add up over the course of a year.  You'd be amazed how interested some people have been when I've told them how little money it costs me each month!

I shopped around because I was watching the price on the ZTE plummet, but this phone stayed at $99 until a recent drop to $89. I hit a different retailer who was selling the unit for $79 and figured I would pull the proverbial trigger. I upgraded from a really nice and functional Samsung 425G and really do miss my slide out keyboard, but all things considered, THIS is a superior phone to my previous Samsung and a definite superior product to the ZTE offering - don't get me wrong, my wife likes that phone, but isn't one to explore the phone and find out what it can do.Best advice I can offer potential buyers of ANY Tracfone you're considering to purchase is to go to the manufacturer's website and download the full manufacturer's owner's manual. You can also get them at Tracfone's site...but load and read the manual BEFORE you buy the phone. These android phones offer more bells and whistles than anyone can (or will) utilize. Now, if you're familiar with Android, and I am ... you've got a step up.Next, if you plan on utilizing the MP3 player for music ... buy a memory card. One does not come with the unit as it does with the ZTE - a small one, but it is included. The music player on this phone is very restrictive. The CD's that I own and had copied to my old Samsung would not play on this phone, even after I converted that content to an MP3 format. I don't illegally download music so, it's just some copyright garbage at play here, so I went to Google Play and purchased the PowerAmp player for $4.Phone reception is really good. At times, the unit will only show 3 bars - mainly in my home - but I haven't had dropped calls or anything. On one occasion, I was in a 'dead spot', turned the \"data\" on and the 3G kicked in...and the call went through. As I rule of thumb, I keep \"data\" turned off and live off WiFi sites...not even 'hotspots'...businesses that I'm in...restaurants, banks, what have you will usually give you access.Do get a phone case. The phone looks like a more expensive model...but...it has rounded, smooth edges and honestly is a little slippery.Now granted most of what I've covered is what I call fluffy stuff. The phone itself is a superior bargain. I can not stress enough the importance of getting the manufacturer's owner's manual. I also can not stress enough reminding potential buyers that you're not getting a $400 phone that you think should wash and wax your car.Major difference with these Android phones is the pricing structure. The cost of sending a standard text TRIPLES - that's right -- TRIPLES. My not-so-smart Samsung 425G (also a triple minutes phone) cost me approximately one-third of a minute (or unit) per text. Every text now costs a full minute (or unit) per. Plus, if you're looking to text a large file (photo, video, et al), you're probably going to do well to turn your \"data\" on prior to sending that text and shutting it back off afterward. Use the WiFi as much as you can because I know full-well that the new pricing structure was set up to get users to pay for 'data' cards. Which is fine.

So I'm getting 150mb data per month.  I am a little surprised that it's looking like that's pretty adequate.

I've used various tracfones over the years and I can say this is the best full featured phone they've ever offered their customers.  Two reasons to love this phone are 1) it's a very attractive phone and 2) its a full featured smartphone.  Without rambling too much I'll try to sum up the pros and cons of this great phone.PROS - Attractive full featured android smartphone.  The color of the phone is more a stately blue than grey.  - Very good battery life if you manage things you aren't using (i.e. BT, WiFi, screen brightness, data, other services)  - Excellent standby battery life (it can easily last for 8 days if you use it infrequently.)  - Incoming phone voices sound natural  - The phone's speaker sounds good and is loud enough when listening to MP3s and MP4 movies  - Accepts and plays android APPS from the Amazon store.  - Offers TALK, TEXT, and DATA  - 3 MP camera.  Takes nice pictures.CONS - You will need to download the user manual from Samsung if you want the FULL manual.  - There is a learning curve if you are not used to using the android operating system.  - You will have to register for Google services like the Google play store if you want to use them.  -  Price.  The phone is $99 which is a bit more expensive than older tracfones of lesser value.I still own and use my trusty semi-smart LG 840G as a second phone but if you are looking for a phone that is FULL android OS and are up to a little learning curve I think you will enjoy being able to use various android APPS on the Samsung Galaxy. Something to keep in mind is that Tracfone distributes the minutes for this \"triple minutes\" phone a little differently from their other phones. So if you buy a 200 minute refill card you will get 600 minutes of TALK, 600 TEXTS, and 600 mb of DATA.  You will have to decide if this kind of distribution meshes with how you use your phone.

Considering Straight Talk was selling the same phone for 30 bucks, and ST and Tracfone are one in the same. Phone time is a better deal on Tracfone however.Coming from the LG840G to this one seems to have made for a steep learning curve. Though not to hard to figure out within a little time. I had contacts transfered in about 3 minutes.The Centura is pretty glitch free, and you have the ability to turn off data so that's a plus. I like how triple minutes is tripled on calling, texting, and data. True 1 text takes a full unit,  but it does not take away from calling or data.Some of the things I don't like are items connected to google. Like you need an account to use the calender. Setting up an alarm is not as easy as with the LG840G, and though I can find an app called voice recording. I can't for the life of me find a way to use it. I assume there is an app for that like there is for everything else. I don't like the Tracfone app, but at least you can add time though it with a store bought card and not have to use their slow website.This phone seems to run a straight android OS, without the Tracfone dated OS's that they have used on older phones. I have not rooted it, but it looks like I can without a problem. You would also think that if Tracfone is going with some android phones now, they surely could offer the premium phones.Sound is good, much better than LG. The screen while smaller than other phones is more than usable. Even running at 50% brightness, I have no problem using it.Rambling I know, but it is what it is.On a scale of one to 10.

Though we had LG smartphones, I still had a \"backup\" dumb TracFone with minutes and service on it.  I was quite happy to be able to transfer the minutes and service days to my new phone just using the TracFone website with no human assistance.

Before the phone activation process was completed, I was using the WiFi capability to set up my google account.  My contacts transferred automatically to my new phone.The bottom line: it wasn't a nightmare getting the phone setup.  I have figured that in about 6 months, the cost of the new phones will have been recovered from the money I saved by not paying $35/month times two for both my wife and myself on Virgin Mobile.I have no complaints with their service, but money saved is money saved (I just ordered a Samsung for my wife too).The only issue I have noted so far is that the voice input for texting requires an extra step to utilize.

Now the Samsung Centura is probably no iphone but for a fraction of the cost, I'm very satisfied.There are a few quirks that are frustrating to me.  One, the hardest thing to figure out was how to set up speed dials - the functionality is there, it's just not very intuitive.  To set up speed dials, touch and hold the contact widget and drag it to your home screen.  Then your contacts pop up and you can choose which contact to assign to that speed dial.  You do this multiple times for each contact that you want to add a speed dial for.  You can either have each one be a separate icon on your home screen or, you can do what I did and drag and drop them on top of each other which puts them all into a folder which you can name \"speed dials\" or whatever.  Then just tap the folder, tap the contact, and tap to call or text.Also, it's kind of annoying that if you miss a call or get a text while your screen is \"asleep\", there is no visual notification that pops up- you have to manually turn the screen on to check for missed calls.  Seems like this has been a feature on all my previous phone so I'm surprised that this phone doesn't have that.  But, there are a few apps that you can download to fix this.  The one I have is called No LED which works fine.And the last thing is that the calendar/reminder function is not very robust.  For example, I like to set a reminder to take set my garbage out every other Tuesday.  Well, there is no way to set up an event for alternating weeks like on most other calendars and, again, there is no visual notification or alarm that will notify you if your screen is asleep.  Even the apps I've found for this don't do exactly what I'm looking for.  Maybe I'm missing something but haven't found a good solution to this yet.Oh, and I've had problems retrieving mms messages but I just read one of the previous reviews that said you have to turn on your mobile data to get those to download.  Just tried that and it worked!So overall, a really really good phone for the price.  Just be prepared to do some research to get some things to work like you want them to but I'm finding that if you just spend some time reading these Amazon reviews, you'll pick up a lot of good tips :) !", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my needs", "Author": "Judy C. Kibler", "ReviewID": "R2UF3HLN760GJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first smartphone so I cannot compare the Samsung Galaxy Centura to more expensive smartphones. I have been a TracFone customer for nearly 7 years and, although I yearned for a smartphone, I didn't want to spend several hundred dollars, have an expensive contract, or even pay for the least expensive plans of $40 or $45 per month. I have had the Samsung Galaxy Centura for several weeks and it suits my needs perfectly. I love that it has wi-fi so I do not need to use my data if I am near wi-fi (I have a router at home).Everything has worked perfectly so far. Apps I have downloaded from the Google Play Store work fine. Love the Android OS. On wi-fi, downloads and web page loading is reasonably fast. I haven't tried the cellular data connection so can't say about speeds there. YouTube plays well. NO FLASH videos, though, since Flash is not supported in Google Chrome anymore (an Adobe decision, from what I understand, not Google's decision). I have had no trouble with the clock as some reviewers have complained of. Though not as large as some more expensive phones, the phone and screen are a good size and the weight feels sturdy. I bought a nice (and pretty) protective cover from a kiosk in the local mall which makes it even sturdier and less slippery to handle.No trouble transferring my number and minutes from an old TracFone.The one con I have encountered so far is the cellular signal is not very strong at my home, although I checked before purchasing the phone and it said it would work in my area. At my home I consistently have one, two, and, only occasionally, three bars. When out and about, however, the signal is usually much better. I have not had a problem calling, however, even when the signal bars show low reception. But I have not made extended phone calls so I don't know whether calls may be dropped or the signal would break up if talking at length on a low signal. Also have not traveled out of town since purchasing the phone, so I'm counting on Verizon to give me good coverage when I travel I-95 to visit family and hope I won't be disappointed.I do not keep the phone on all the time, only when I leave my house, so my experience may differ from someone who uses the phone more heavily. I recommend reading the manual available for the phone. It can be downloaded from the TracFone web site or one can find it by Googling.So far, I am enjoying the phone and it is fitting my needs well. For someone who talks, texts, and browses the Internet hours each day, a TracFone would probably not be a good option since they would blow right through the minutes and data, but if you are looking for a nice smartphone for lighter use and you just want to introduce yourself to smartphones, I would recommend the Samsung Galaxy Centura Android Prepaid Phone (TracFone).", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Some issues with new Galaxy Centura", "Author": "Liesel", "ReviewID": "R2H53K992GMQTF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It seems to be slower with internet, which I expected, being reasonably priced, but I have had problems with screen freezing.

At the time I purchased Tracfone only offered the Samsung Galaxy Centura or ZTE Valet for my zip code that also ran Android 4.0 or greater. Not a lot to choose from.Call Quality - I am very pleased with the call quality as the Galaxy Centura uses Verizon's networks. It is far superior to the Samsung T404G (I believe AT&T; network) being replaced. This is really dependent on your local area and which cell phone has the best coverage.Overall performance - 800 MHz processor single core- sometimes it is a little slow compared to my iTouch when running apps. Changing screens and such, you can see some hesitation. Definitely acceptable, especially considering the price.WiFi - My router at home is centrally located in a 2000 sq ft house and I get wifi reception everywhere in the house. Compared to the iTouch that this unit is replacing, the Centura does show fewer bars, but again it still connects and I have had no problems.Head Phone jack - The sound coming out of the head phone jack is terrible, a lot of feed back noise. I bought two phones at the same time and both phones exhibit this behavior. If you turn on the equalizer in the stock \"Play Music\" app the noise is greatly amplified - very irritating. The only saving grace is that the noise is not present when transmitting via blue tooth. So I use a Blue tooth head phone set (Sony SBH20B) or the car stereo to listen to music.Time - Every now and then the Centura loses what time it is, not often ... for instance in a month it happened once on my phone and my wife's phone it hasn't happened yet. The fix for this is to use ClockSync from the Google Play Store. I still would not use the phone as an alarm clock.Data usage - I am using the family plan at Tracfone and only get 150mb a month, therefore one of the first things to do is go into the data management and set the phone to only use wifi for data.Tracfone - I had no problem transferring the minutes from my old phones to the new phones.

She has been a Tracfone user for over 10 years.  I was a Tracfone user for many years but left several years ago when I bought my first smart phone.  I'm very pleased with the purchase.  A couple of issues my mom has with the phone is the predictive typing and accidently touching the ring volume button on the left side of the phone.  I turned off the predictive typing and have to remind her to be careful not to press the ringer volume button on the left or she may not hear her incoming calls and text messages.  I'm very happy with the purchase.  I'm thinking of switching back to Tracfone now that they carry Android phones.  P.S.  This phone does not use a SIM card so you won't have to call Tracfone to get a SIM card for your calling area.  I tried to switch my moms phone number, air time and minutes through the Tracfone web site but was unable to complete the transfer so I had to make several calls to Tracfone to get the new phone activated but that's par for Tracfone.

While the Valet was functional enough for simple Android tasks, it would quite frequently labor under its sluggish hardware.  Samsung's Centura is a definite upgrade, especially when it comes to display and processor capabilities.  It most certainly classifies as an entry-level Android device like the Valet.  However, its overall performance level is a notch above what a typical user would experience on ZTE's TracFone offering.There are a couple of drawbacks to the Galaxy Centura, the biggest being its lack of a notification LED.  Unlike the Valet, you'll have no flashing light on the Centura indicating missed calls or texts.  You'll have to periodically turn on the screen to verify such activity.  The other key feature missing here is an LED flash.  The ZTE's camera was pretty lousy, but it did have a flash which could be turned into a flashlight with any number of apps available at Google Play.  That is not the case with the Samsung counterpart.  If you like having LEDs (both notification and flash) on your Android device, then going with a Valet would be a wiser choice.  The Centura lacks both.In the final analysis, I'll always prefer a device with better performance and a superior screen.  That's where the Centura really wins this contest.

For this they allowed me to pay them $83 a month!  I once had a BlackBerry Storm 2 for four years which I loved but I wanted something that was 4G.  My husband has had TracFones for years and has gotten good service given the little he needed a phone.  However, he is always asking me if his phone can do this or that and I tell him no because he doesn't have a smartphone.  Well for Valentine's I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Centura for him.  It is 3G, but works wonderfully on our WiFi network. When it's on any WiFi (which is most of the time) no time is deducted from the time allotted after buying an airtime card.  I downloaded a texting app that is free and he uses it for texting because it also uses WiFi ).  Therefore, he seldom pays for a call or a text (and now data) except for buying a $20 card every 90 days.  He has many minutes to use because TracFone triples the new minutes from each card and rolls unused minutes forward. (This doesn't apply to data).  The clock (doesn't keep right time) issue (discussed by other reviewers over and over again is also true for my husband's phone.  I downloaded a clock app that seems to be working just fine so even that isn't a real problem. This phone doesn't have a front-facing camera so Skype Tango and OoVoo aren't possible, but other than those items mentioned this is a \"GREAT\" phone for a good price.  Unless a person is using the internet, talking on the phone all the time, and texting a lot (and doesn't have WiFi) don't hesitate to purchase this phone.

It's an Android phone2. It's Tracfone - no contract and inexpensive monthly if you use your WiFi at home and don't use it every 5 minutes when you are out3. The phone is relatively inexpensive given its capability4. Tons of apps - Playstore and of course Amazon Appstore are fully loaded for your handheld application needs.5. Samsung makes a good product with good functionality6. There is an app on Playstore that also has a Widget to show you your remaining talk, text, and data.  Don't freak out when you can't find the \"Prepaid\" function, it's not on the phone.  You have to activate your phone first, then get the free \"Tracefone my account\" app on Google's Play Store.  This app does what the old prepaid button or menu selection did.7. Triple minutes, texts, and data separately.  So you buy a 200 minute card and get 600 units for talking, 600 units for texting, and 600 MB of data.  You can also buy data separately on a data card.8. It's WiFi so you don't have to use any units for text or any data if you use an internet text app and of course use your or someone else's WiFi.9, It supports a 32 GB micro SD card so you can load a ton of photos and music without overloading the phone's memory.The downside:1. It's Tracfone - customer service is usually jammed especially at Xmas.2. The instructions tell you that you can go to the website to activate the phone but you CANNOT.  I hate it when instructions are wrong and I spent a whole lot of time trying to figure out how to activate my phone online only to realize you CANNOT.  You have to call the customer service and deal with folks whose English may not be so good and don't know how to do everything that is necessary.  It took two people and one hour (no exaggeration 1 hour)  to get my daughters minutes transferred.  In fairness to Tracfone on Xmas day the initial phone setup part was relatively fast but the minutes transfer on my daughter's phone two days later was literally one hour of me waiting while this poor guy tried to help me but he just didn't know what to do and then finally me getting his supervisor who fixed it in about 5-10 minutes.3. It took literally 2 days for my wife's phone to transfer over.  Everything was right but it took literally 2 days.  Again I think this was due to the high volume at the holidays.  But two days.  Come on.4. I don't know if it is the version of Android or just some bad apps but I've gotten Google's music player to crash the operating system multiple times and two purchased apps to crash it as well.  The phone comes with the \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" version of Android (4.0.4) which is two versions ago relative to the newest \"Kit Kat\".  The thing is I have a Samsung Galaxy Player which uses the 4 version old \"Gingerbread\" Android operating system and I never got it to crash.  Don't fret though.  Most of this happened when I was deleting files from the micro SD card or modifying MP3's so the album art would show up.  Since I finished all that, no crashes.5. It doesn't recognize most of my album art.  All my MP3 downloads show album art but almost everything I ripped from CD's does not show up.  I got a free app called \"iTag\" on Play Store which was tedious to use (I have hundreds of albums and had to change each one) but worked as advertised to fix my album art.  Note that you need to just fix the first song on an album and check the box entitled \"Set this cover art as album's default cover art\" and all of the songs from that album will show the album art.Overall, I like the phone a lot.  It's by far the best Tracfone I've owned.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 mostly because the instructions were wrong and the customer service, though trying hard and having good intentions, was inadequate.

My kids text more frequently, but seem to get a good life span before text needs to be reloaded.  They tend to use their itouch to text chat while they are at home, using the house wifi.  This also helps to maintain the phone text units.  This way they have units when they are outside the house.  The same goes for data usage.  We all use the house wifi for data when we are home.  If my kids are just surfing the internet, and are away from home, they often find complimentary wifi while out .... restaurants, malls, school etc.  We do not use public wifi for checking email or any other financial or personal transactions.

There are some issues, but I'm happy to finally have a smartphone without having to spend 80 bucks a month for a phone with a data plan. With this Tracfone with its triple minutes, if I buy a 200-minute card, it's parted out differently than with the regular phones. I get 600 talk minutes, 600 texts, and 600 MB of data, along with 90 days of service. That's awesome, and lasts a long time. Plus, it has wi-fi, so the data actually doesn't get used very quickly. I went through programs and chose which ones I wanted to get notifications from (basically, all I really want are texts and Google Chat messages; I don't need to be connected to Facebook constantly), which took some doing. At first, the phone was beeping at me constantly.I love being able to access all the Android apps and play a lot of the games I've played on my tablet. The screen size is pretty decent, although it's hard for me to text with the phone in portrait mode. I finally figured out how to allow the phone to go into landscape mode, so that helps some.I'm disappointed that texts aren't more prominent. With all my old phones, a text was displayed on the phone until I acknowledged it in some way, by reading it or dismissing the message. With this, I get an audio sound (which is the same as the audio sound for everything else, and a tiny icon up in the top with all the other tiny icons. It's not immediately clear that there's a text waiting for me, which is frustrating when someone needs an answer quickly. But I suppose I'll get used to it. I did download an app (Skyvi, which is a free Android take on Siri) that gives me a clear indication that I have a text, but it has to be always online to use, which I'd rather not do.I am also frustrated that I can't save apps to the SD card, like I can with my Android tablet. I've read that's a Samsung Galaxy thing. It's kind of pointless; within two months of having the phone, the internal storage was full and I had to start deleting larger programs. There are programs I won't use specifically because they take up too much space. I did find out how to set the SD card as default storage for photos, which was a big deal for me as I take a lot of photos. The phone has a pretty decent camera, and I love that I can pinch-zoom on the photos. As for video, I wish it had both front and back cameras so I could do video chat. I tried Skyping with my friend and while I could see him, all he could see was whatever my phone was looking at. I ended going into the bathroom and pointing it at the mirror!While I don't use the 3G a lot (and I'd avoid watching videos for sure), it's nice to have if I want it, to look up a map, a phone number, or just resolve an argument when I'm away from home. I do try to avoid using unnecessary minutes, but I restrict that mostly to apps working in the background. I don't hesitate to look something up on the phone; it's what I have a smartphone for.I do have a couple of odd issues with this phone that go beyond my complaints with the actual features. Every once in a while it will just stop working. Nothing happens when I press the buttons, and it will vibrate over and over. I have to shut the phone off and turn it on again. And a few times it has turned itself off and won't turn on again until I pop the battery out and put it back in, which is a pain because the back is hard to take off (I've gotten better at it). Also, I hate that the micro SD card slot is under the cover, which pretty much precludes my putting the card into the reader on my computer unless I absolutely can't find a micro USB cord.It sounds like I don't like my phone, but I really do; part of my frustrations, I think, come from being a new smartphone user and being used to a phone that's just a phone. I looked at all the smartphones Tracfone offered, and this one appeared to be the best, and I do like it, especially with the savings I got here on Amazon. When they offer better phones, I'll probably seriously consider getting one, but I think I've got the best smartphone I can get through Tracfone, and I'm happy enough with that to give this phone four stars.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pretty okay with just two lil' problems", "Author": "Jypsycat", "ReviewID": "R193SG64XF9QE1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think the phone itself is pretty nifty for an old babe like me. My chief gripe, and I know others have expressed this concern as well, is the division of the talk/text/data minutes. I text, but not a lot. I don't use the data at all (I'm in front of a computer for most of the day, why should I?). I do talk. So I have a ton of data minutes, and quite a bit of texting minutes but my talk minutes are way down. I'm assuming when I buy more minutes, I'll have a plethora of data, a bucket load of text, and I'll run through my talk minutes in a heartbeat. I also don't care for getting online to request my balance amounts. All the other Tracfone's I've had showed it right on the screen; what's so different about this phone? I do like the phone, however, and will stick with it. I haven't had the freeze up as some have complained about, my calls sound good and the signal is much better than my old Tracfone. Plus, as a long-time Tracfone user, I think it's absolutely the way to go smart phone wise, especially when I hear my friends talk about how much their cell bills are every month for phones not all that different from mine.

I decided now that Tracfone is offering Android devices, and after punching my zipcode into their website, it was determined they would work in my area, so I decided it was time for an upgrade.After receiving my phone, I followed the directions to transfer my number, my old phone quit working, then it came time to activate my new phone. It would not activate using the instructions of calling *22890. When calling that number it stated \"this call cannot be completed as dialed\".I called Tracfone support and after several hours of powering phone off, do this, do that, it was determined the phone must be defective. So I returned it to Amazon, and purchased another model Android phone. After receiving this phone, it would still not activate, and spent a couple more hours on the phone with elevated tech support.Now, I'm finally at Level 3 support, and they have a carrier network engineer (for Verizon, since that is the service these phones operate) on the other end. I was told drive a few miles from my home zip code, activate it, then all would be good.I proceeded to do this, and after returning to my home zip code, I could receive calls, but when making calls, all I got was a message \"please re-enter the phone number and do not press send\". I had to do this for every outgoing number.After researching further online, and no help from Tracfone support, I found out I'm living in a area that Verizon does not consider a \"home network\". But still showed me as having service in their extended network.So to sum all this up, unless you live in the Verizon \"Home Network\", you will not be able to activate your phone, and if you do travel to an area to activate it, and return home, it will be extra steps to make outbound calls because you are essentially roaming on someone else cell towers.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "clock randomly changes, alarm clock unreliable, shame on Samsung.", "Author": "JEP4", "ReviewID": "R26A08ERKM2KAX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The clock randomly sets itself back 5 hours, making the alarm clock pointless.

I reset the time to the correct time and when I hit set it jumped to 6:25 am. Turning the phone off and back on corrected the issue but I can't rely on this phone for any alarms.No matter where I try to use wi-fi the phone never shows more than one bar.When my alarm does go off at the correct time it has locked up the phone. The alarm will sound jerky and the only way to get it to stop is turn the phone off.Dialing phone numbers is counter-intuitive. I have called peolpe while I was just attempting to update their profiles. It is easy to pocket dial people as well. When I'm done using the phone I have to lock the screen so that I don't open up apps, dial or message someone.I get good battery life out of the phone because I downloaded a battery doctor app and it seems to help but it takes vigilance.I can't get the phone to sync with my computer.

(My old phone was the 800g.)The Tracfone story..very abbreviated.After 14 days of no phone service, 8 phone calls to Tracfone customer service--(3 of them over a hour in length), 5 SIM card replacements, I finally had phone service again. I have been with Tracfone for over 9 years, and never had this kind of trouble before. Every customer service rep was courteous and helpful. But there were mistakes, and every mistake led to a new SIM card and more waiting to see if the phone would activate. I complicated the process, because when the Samsung had no service bars, I decided to change back to my old phone, and then to the new LG. In the end I have good reception in an area where other networks fail, I love my phone, Tracfone gave me 3 months and a thousand extra minutes. During this time I was home recuperating from knee surgery, so at least I had the landline to depend on.I actually did some research to change phone systems, but didn't find anything out there as economical. I have so many minutes on my phone, that it could spend hours and hours on it and never run out, so I guess I will stay with Tracfone in spite of it all. The problems with activation were not entirely the company, because I am sure I added to the confusion along the way. But we got it right in the end, and every rep I talked to was helpful, courteous and pleasant.The phone:Basic, easy to use. I like the touch screen for sending texts. It isn't as easy a touch as an iPhone screen, and I got a stylus to help me hit the small keypad. Not a good phone if you want to use it for email/Internet use.

The support person told me that itwas automatic and she could do nothing about it (I had called prior to doing this to see if there was a way of returning adefective phone while keeping my minutes until I got a replacement. No, you have to transfer the minutes to another phone - noputting them in 'storage' til a new phone arrived). Since I had the need to go to tech support some years back when I lost myminutes, I knew that there was a way to do it through a supervisor who walked me thru a lengthy process of adding numbers tovarious screens until I got my minutes back. So I argued respectfully with the tech support person, who eventually asked: \"Do youthink I am lying\". I replied that I did - that's as disrespectful as I got (side note: when contacting them, don'tdisrespect/swear/etc. just don't allow them to hang up, don't give them a reason to hang up e.g disrespect/vulgarity.) When sheasked me if there was anything else she could do for me, I just kept saying she needed to connect me with or provide a phonenumber for a supervisor. She said repeatedly she couldn't do it and even claimed she WAS a supervisor. But I stayed on the lineand she would occasionally ask: \"Are you still there?\" to which I replied \"yes\". After about 30-40 minutes, she finally said shewas transferring me to her manager, who resolved the issue for me and I'm able to keep my minutes while 'downgrading'.One factor might have influenced my success: no minutes were purchased thru the Android phone receiving triple minutes - all my minutes were purchased with the previous old phone. And I only had the Android phone for a few days.Two days later when my new SIM card arrived to be used in the old phone, I called to finish the task. Even then, the first rep Igot repeated the tiresome litany about not being able to transfer the minutes back to the old phone and said my confirmationnumber was in valid. When I argued for a while with him and insisted on speaking to someone. He transferred me to someone who hung up on me pretending not to hear me. So I called again and got someone who started the process and said there were some issues. He asked me to hold while he reached a supervisor. I was then transferred to a very pleasant female rep who completed the process without batting an eye. I didn't even have to go thru the process of entering all those codes on the phone like I did some years back with my first experience of recovering lost minutes. From then on it was painless and I have my old phone back in operation with my minutes restored. Apparently from my conversation two days prior with a manager had gotten the whole process settled so that this last rep only asked me for my phone no., serial no. and SIM serial no.The key: persistence and patience. ;-)  Sorry you had to lose yours and give up on Tracfone - their service/support is ratherlacking...it shouldn't have been so hard.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "okay, maybe for the price", "Author": "The Queen", "ReviewID": "R3KSYDSODETLNR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Smart phone - check.Cool apps - check.Locks up daily - check.Won't play all of my music, necessitating some internet research - check.Google Maps app stops functioning regularly mid course - check.Does NOT have as good reception as the TracFone dumb phones - check.Would have been a better deal at half the price.

On her previous phone a 120 minute card tripled was 360 minutes. A text was 1/3 of a minute so she got 1080 texts. On the new Android phones you get 120 phone minutes, 120 texts, and 120 data minutes. Since my daughter usually texts she was out of texts and had added enough air time to have over 1000 talk minutes built up. We decided to transfer her back to her old phone figuring she could at least use those minutes up before getting a different service. They transferred her number, but the Android phone contract does not allow for transfer of minutes. No service rep (and I talked to too many in the transfer process)mentioned that, and the first rep actually said they WOULD transfer. Her new phone from a different carrier arrives today. They have lost one customer from this family and once my minutes are gone I will be considering new carriers as well.

For starters the phone likes to go to sleep sometimes when I click on an app. I have to press the power button to wake it up. Not a big deal but annoying still. My phone actually turned itself on! I shut the phone off before going to bed. As usual it did its routine and turned off. About five minutes later I hear music, turn to look at my nightstand and bam, the phone started back up! Very creepy. Then this morning I turned the phone on and it came on in some kind of protection mode. I had to choose a reboot option and it finally came on...slowly. Now to cap it off I discovered I couldn't receive group texts from friends. Tracfone said the Samsung galaxy doesn't accept them! I still get charged for them though! It will say the network is busy, try again later. I did and nothing! Its bad enough the smart phones charge more per text than the the dumb ones but to charge me for a text it doesn't allow to be opened?!
