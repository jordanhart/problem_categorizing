When you pick delivery companies and people that leave valuable mercahndise that is paid for on people's doorsteps or outside you cannot possibly think that package is going to get to the rightful owner!  What a dissappointment!  I could not recover my property no matter how hard i tried.  To fix this error and make the party responsible for this error to reimburse me will never happen. No matter who I talked to each person tried to put the blame on the other. You should tell the company you  hire to do your deliveries NOT TO EVER EVER leave merchandise outside the person's door. It is your mistake for hiring these people to do your deliveries.  It is your responsiblility to make sure the products your customers order from you get to them!!! I dont think i will ever order anything online again because of this.
