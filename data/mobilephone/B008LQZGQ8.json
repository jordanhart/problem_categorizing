After a little trial and error i found that the JVC HAFX5B Gumy Plus Inner Ear Headphones work just fine once you cut back the base a couple of mm, easily done with just a sharp knife.they have pretty good sound too. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking to get on the big phone bandwagon without spending too much money. If it wasn't for the problem with the headphone I would have given this phone 5 stars.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works well", "Author": "NC", "ReviewID": "R37GL76SA1O55Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price I got this, it is extremely good. I connect to office network and home network, and occasionally to a Mifi device.  So did not test Sim card, and am not intending to use it.  Everything else works as per expectation (not as great as iPhone, but the price makes a huge difference).  Also, initially they said it will take about a month, but came in about 2.5 weeks (so +1 for that).", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008LQZGQ8"}}
