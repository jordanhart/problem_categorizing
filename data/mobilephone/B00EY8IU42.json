However, this phone is not meant for usage in the United States on the T- Mobile network. I could not make any outgoing calls what so ever. I called T-Mobile and was told that it is not the network but yet the unlocking and the firmware of the device that prevents the outgoing call. Truthfully this phone will only get you 2G/EDGE at best. Which I was cool with that. I really only wanted to make and receive calls and txt. But when I found out that this phone only supports one aspect of T-Mobile I was very disappointed. Again beautiful device but I don't want beauty, I functionality. So I am sending it back to Amazon for a refund due to it not working properly. By the way this is not my first go around with generic clone phones and this is a very common issue with phones made over seas. My suggestion is please do your research before ordering.I am in no way bashing the seller. I believe that, they believe they are selling a product that will live up to expectation and the specs that they were told. Again please research so you too don't by something not worth having.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "TAM", "ReviewID": "R366M74PLI3TXB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love it.I gave it as a present.  she said it is a wonder.  do not let home without it.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Eson I9220", "Author": "tori hardy", "ReviewID": "RII5FM1Q1A4O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is only worth it appearance, a couple weeks after I received the phone it stopped charging.
