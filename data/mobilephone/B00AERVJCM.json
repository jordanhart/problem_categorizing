If you are wanting a phone that is WAY better than the flip phone you previously had through Tracfone (plus triple minutes for life!) than it is well worth the $45.00.  I've been a tracfone guy for 10 years.  I have a land line, I have a computer at work & home and a laptop I can travel with.  I don't talk on the phone or text that much (200 minutes a month if I'm lucky).  I just couldn't justify a REAL smart phone like an Iphone or droid and a $50+ a month bill when i'm paying less than $15 now.  I mainly got this phone because frankly I was embarrased to be seen talking on my flip phone and texting was a joke without a keyboard.  I HAVE connected to the internet but you have to jump through so many hoops it really isn't worth it and that's with the Wi Fi. I wouldn't even waste my minutes trying to get on the internet with 3G. I loaded my Mp3's on it, can take pictures and video and it LOOKS like everybody elses smartphone.  It doesn't have some features that I would have liked like voice activated dialing and some other things.  The real thing I don't like is the fact that when a call comes in it becomes \"unlocked\", you don't have to finger slide it to unlock it like my wife's smartphone so it is easy to accidently either answer it without wanting to or reject call just by reaching into your pocket to grab it.  I could have switched to Virgin and paid $35.00 a month and $400 for an Iphone but for my line of work where I am in the office most of the time and next to my computer it really doesn't make sense at this time, maybe someday, but for now I'm happy with my $45.00 aquisition.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty doggone good for a Tracfone-A Long Winded Review.", "Author": "squashpup \"squashpup\"", "ReviewID": "R302R4WBV0KFBS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had several LG Tracfones in the past and they were always quality products.  The LG840g is no exception.  I got mine to replace a LG500g that I had for over a year.  After one week, here are my impressions.The phone itself is about the size of an Ipod Touch, and similar in shape and appearance. It looks expensive. The \"wake\" button is recessed which makes it difficult to hit accidentally, and the volume buttons are on the side where they would be on an Ipod.  The buttons on the front are capacitive touch, like the screen.It is not a smart phone and runs a java based proprietary operating system which allows the installation of .jar apps.Battery life depends on how you use it.  I left the WiFi running and the battery drained to one bar in 24 hours.  It didn't shut down, but it was definitely low. Only using the WiFi occasionally, the battery is still on full bars after 3 days.  I haven't run the phone all the way down yet, but the advertised standby is over 10 days.The interface is easy to use, and the touch-screen is capacitive, which makes it easy to use.  It feels a lot like an Ipod/Iphone.  I don't like the pale blue backgrounds for the menus, but there's no way I know of to change it.It wouldn't connect to my home WiFi, a Belkin router, unless I set a static IP address.  If you're having problems connecting, choose \"Edit Network\" and under IP/DNS Setting, choose \"Static\".  You will then have to configure the settings specific to your router using your keen sense of Google Fu.One problem is the keyboard.  You only get a QWERTY in certain situations, such as entering web addresses, texting, etc.  If you go to a website that has input text boxes, such as webmail, you'll be sorely disappointed.  One solutiom is to download the free Opera browser that comes with its own keyboard, which always lets you enter text with QWERTY.  It's a little sluggish, but usable. It beats the default browser by far.When you do download apps for this, you'll notice that third party apps will display a navigation keyboard at the bottom.  If you use a JAD file to install, open it in Notepad and insert the following at the end:Navi-Key-Hidden: trueNokia-MIDlet-On-Screen-Keypad: noMIDlet-ScreenMode: ROTATEMIDlet-Landscape-Support: trueLGE-MIDlet-Width: 240LGE-MIDlet-Height: 400LGE-MIDlet-On-Screen-Keypad: noLGE-MIDlet-Display-Mode: bothThis will kill the navigation keyboard, which is unnecessary with a touch screen and just takes extra space anyway.Doing this, I was able to run Opera Mini, Google Maps, UC Browser, and eBuddy in full screen mode.  Also, with this phone being similar to the LG T375 Cookie Smart, some apps made for it will run on the LG 840G.  Again, using your Google Fu will help you find apps. Download them to the SD card in your phone, find them in the menus and tap on them to run.Video conversion is easy with Mobile Media Converter, a free video converter from Miksoft that runs on Mac, Linux, or Windows.Install it and drag and drop your video(s) into the window. From the \"Conversion To:\" menu, choose \"Iphone/Ipod with Subs\" and hit the button marked \"Advanced\" .The \"More Configuration\" menu will come up. On both \"Audio Bitrate\" and \"Video Bitrate\", the lower the number, the less quality, but smaller the file. Higher numbers will be better quality but take up more space. Video FPS (frames per second) should be set to your preferred quality...a smaller number is more \"jittery\" but a smaller file, and a larger number is smoother but takes more space. If you're encoding a 4:3 (square) video, make sure \"Video Size\" is checked and enter \"320:240\" in the space beside it. If you're encoding a 16:9 (rectangular) video, make sure \"Video Size\" is checked and enter \"320:200\" in the space beside it. Audio Frequency: higher is better quality and larger file, lower is lesser quality and smaller file. If you're not using headphones, you can also choose to only have one mono channel instead of a stereo channel, which will also save space.This phone charges differently for data than other TracFones I've had previously.  The old ones used to charge for time, regardless of data transfer.  Meaning, 1 minute of web brwosing was .5 units.  This made it dangerous to leave the browser on for long periods of time!  Then new one seems to charge for transfer, but I can't figure out the ratio exactly.  Regardless, I can load a page and actually have time to READ it.  The pages I visit are mostly text, so this works out better for me. There are differing theories on what the actual cost per KB are, and TracFone's website is no help.  You'll have to blow a few minutes and do experimentation to figure out what your frequently visited sites cost to browse.The email program is simple, but works slickly enough with Gmail.  I haven't tried it with another provider.YouTube works only in the default browser, and even then, it is scaled down to a size not much bigger than a postage stamp.  This wouldn't be so bad if they allowed you to scale the video up to a reasonable size, but they do not, so you're forced t watch a 1.5\"x1\" video in the middle of a much larger black screen.It also has a Social Networking Service app that allows you to access your Twitter, Facebook and Myspace accounts.All in all, the LG840G is a nice, solid phone, and leaps and bounds better than TracFones of the past.  I will be updating this review later, but as for now, I can recommend the LG840g, especially if you handy and don't mind tinkering a little to get added functionality.UPDATE 5/13/13: I added some pictures of what this phone can do.  Note that some of the features, like Opera and Google Maps, must be downloaded and installed by the user, and may require the modification to run in full screen as shown in the pictures.As far as day-to-day usage goes, there are quirks, but it is still pretty darn good.Sometimes, when using Opera, the connection to the browser drops, even while the phone itself is still connected to the internet.  The solution is to stop the browser and re-start it, something of a hassle.  On occasion, the phone itself crashes and restarts, but this is rare - once every couple of months or so.Even so, Opera is worth the trouble of installation. With Opera Turbo running, it compresses data and makes it possible to browse occasionally without burning through too many minutes.  I can usually browse a few sites and kill 5 minutes here and there for 2-3 units. It also can tell you how much data transfer (and therefore, money) it is saving you.  It also speeds thing up significantly.Call quality is good, but reception is not what it was on my LG 500G.  I can't talk in some places that I used to be able to, like when camping. For around town, though, reception is adequate. And, in those places, I can get 3G, which makes surfing much more enjoyable.Wifi kills the battery pretty quickly, like 24 hours or so.  It is easy to forget and leave it on, which could drain your battery in an emergency situation. With the wifi off, the phone will go for days at a time between charges.After living with it for five months, I can recommend this phone to those looking for a good deal on a prepaid phone, but want something that doesn't look like your grandparents would use it, or something from 2003. It is great for talk, text, and occasional web browsing, especially with the Opera upgrade.  If you have any other Tracfone and upgrade to the 840G, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "For what it is, it's 5 stars!", "Author": "Charles P. Shingledecker", "ReviewID": "R1SQEW0SXWRW26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new Tracfone LG 840G touchscreen is by far the best \"poor man's\" phone out there. I have no major complaints with this phone since I bought it for $30 just before Black Friday, 2012.Like all of my previous tracfones, the LG 840G has awesome coverage and reception. The Wi-Fi connection works very well and it enables users to connect to the internet, check email, etc without getting charged valuable minutes by connecting with 3G. However, I have connected with 3G on occasion and it seems to work very well. I've only connected for brief periods of time (all under 5 minutes) and it doesn't seem to deduct huge amounts of pre-paid time -- but I'd never trust myself to surf the web with 3G. However, since it has Wi-Fi, and Wi-Fi is available pretty much everywhere now days, there is no worry.The Touchscreen works pretty much flawlessly. It does take some getting used to, but it works very well. The camera and video are -- well, they're not great, but they are okay.The phone also has MP3 capabilities which I love, and comes with a micro SD card, which is expandable up to -- I believe 32GB.Now, you'll probably see a lot of people complaining that the phone isn't as good as an I-Phone, or a full blown android smartphone -- DUH! It's not. But for what this phone is, it is very good. For those of us who can't afford $50 a month for a full fledged Android service, (or those who just think $50 a month for a cell phone is a ridiculous amount of money) this is the phone to have. Can I shoot HD video, and upload 6MP pics to facebook in 10 seconds? NO! But that is not what this phone is meant to do.It is basically an \"almost\" smartphone and can get people a touchscreen, easy to use, multi-function phone without the huge costs and commitments associated with I-Phones or full blown Android phones.There are a couple of other better options out there in the pre-paid markets, that are actual Android phones -- but again, the monthly costs go up. If you're on a tight budget, but want something that has a lot of the bells and whistles of higher end phones, then this model of worth checking out. The bells and whistles on this one aren't clad in gold and silver, but they do work and are a lot of fun to use.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2A8XR9AMPMRPB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're not me and you don't require a super fancy phone with tons of gadgets, widgets and apps and you're just looking for a phone that will get the job done, then look no further than this phone.

And while it's not one of the \"I just gotta have it\" phones, you won't be disappointed by it's functionality.  It has everything you need from a pretty decent camera with a zoom function, Wi-Fi, 3G, Games, and a Music Player.  This phone comes with a 2GB mini storage card but it has the capability to use up to a 32gb card.  The storage card is used for your music.

I liked the fact this one had 3G and WiFi as well as triple minutes for life.  It is a well built phone.  I already had a USB to micro USB cable and car 12V plug so didn't need to buy one of those.  I spent the first couple days playing around with the Browser over my home WiFi (phone not activated yet).  I saw on youtube how to download the Opera Mini browser and easily did that.  Admittedly the viewing screen for the web is small but it works ok.  I set up my gmail easily in Opera Mini and like the interface there.  After I activated the phone I set it up on the phone's email app which is also decent.Call quality is good.  Speaker phone works well.  i easily dragged and dropped an album onto it.  It's an ok for music.Pictures and videos are grainy but the camera is easy to use and can readily email or text pictures.  I liked that the phone will store phone numbers and email addresses for contacts.Setup thru the tracfone website went well and I got my minutes and days transferred.I didn't have trouble signing on to WiFi or transferring my old phone number.  Sure it uses minutes when on the web via 3G but they don't get sucked right out of the phone as some reviewers implied.  But practice your web usage, email, sending pictures on WiFi to get efficient before going 3G.I had been thinking 'gee I should spend $400-600 then $45 per month for the Walmart iPhone' but now don't feel it is necessary.

Light-years ahead of any previous Tracfone offering (my opinion) this is the best phone I've had since my contract driven Motorola RAZR. In fact this phone does one better with it's WiFi capability with which it instantly found available networks and connected to my home network in a flash after I entered the WEP code. I also used it with public networks with no problem. So if you have a WiFi connection problem as some may have indicated, the problem is with you or your network. The touch screen requires a light touch and is very responsive, it took a little getting used to compared to the heavy handed operation of my previous LG800g. The look and feel of this phone make it worth every penny and it won't embarrass you in public. In fact the only indication of it being a prepaid phone is a tiny obscure Tracfone symbol on the lower back case that at quick glance could be mistaken for the Apple Logo. Update: FYI, be sure you are connected to a WiFi network if you intend to connect to the internet without using up Airtime. If the phone sees no WiFi connection when you open the browser it will connect via the cellular network and your minutes will begin to be used immediately. Simply turning on WiFi from the quick drop down menu may not automatically connect to a network. Use the WiFi icon from the main screen and the WiFi screen will open instantly to show available networks and will automatically connect to your home or any network previously set up to do so. Once you've established that you are connected via WiFi you can be certain the phone will connect you via the WiFi connection and not cellular. Also I downloaded and installed  the Opera Mini 7.1 browser and found it to not be worth the time. Opera is sluggish and does not offer widescreen viewing and about a third of the screen you do have is taken up with a nav bar that you cannot hide. It offers a QWERTY keyboard that is squished compared to the widescreen version already on the phone. I found the phone QWERTY keyboard is available for most all input including adding recipients to your email.  So with that I uninstalled Opera; stick with the Tracfone browser until something better comes along. I did manage to set up the email client on the phone to use my Gmail account. The sound, reception and overall performance of the phone is exceptional especially when considering the price.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "As far as dumb phones go... this is pretty awesome!", "Author": "B. Matthies", "ReviewID": "RW7WLU39UAZBK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a lot of great things to say about this phone. First, I'll tell you a little about me so you can get an idea of where this review is coming from. I'm a 30 year old guy, and I've loved technology all my life. My family got our first computer when I was about 5 in the 80s, so I got started from a young age and it has just continued since then. I'm a geek of sorts and have always been somewhat obsessed with phones of all types. I've a vast amount of knowledge from both research and personal experience. Between prepaid and postpaid accounts, different carriers, etc... I've probably had close to 20 cell phones already!Naturally, smartphones are my current obsession. I currently have the iPhone 5 with Verizon. I love the phone, love the service... and hate the price tag. Even with a hefty 22% corporate discount, my bill still runs me almost $78, with another $5 in local taxes and fees. $80/month is about standard for an individual smartphone plan these days... and compared to standard pricing for Verizon and AT&T;, it's actually a good deal. However, after being laid off recently and seeing the pitiful size of my unemployment benefits, I have been forced to reconsider my finances. In comes the LG 840G.In an effort to save money, I started contemplating suspending my service with Verizon for 90 days, saving myself that $80/month, and living off my old prepaid phone with a ton of minutes on it. However, my old prepaid phone was an absolute nightmare to use, especially when texting. So I did some research and decided on this model, because of the touch screen and other features while still having a very reasonable price. I opted to pay $60 at Family Dollar instead of $40 on Amazon, because I wanted the ability to return the phone without losing out on shipping costs.So, finally starts my actual review of this item! Keep in mind, even though it's touch screen and has the icon layout of a smartphone, IT IS NOT A SMARTPHONE. However, for being a feature phone (or \"dumb phone\"), this phone is actually quite impressive. I enjoy using it and messing around with it, even while having my iPhone 5 sitting right next to me. Granted, that's because it's new to me and anything new is always fun... but I could seriously see myself using this phone regularly if I wasn't locked into a contract with Verizon.The touch screen is fairly accurate and not a pain to use, except when swiping through the icon list. The animation of the pages changing slows down the phone because it isn't that powerful, and if you swipe too quickly, sometimes the page won't change and you have to try again. You get used to it though and within a day, I didn't even notice it anymore. Texting isn't too bad either, especially considering the tiny size of this screen. Like I said, it's pretty accurate. You just can't speed text either though, because the auto correct on this phone is not nearly as accurate or helpful as it is on smartphones. All in all, it's still very usable -- and that says a lot coming from someone who usually uses smartphones.The features on this phone were also pretty nice. WiFi on a basic phone seems crazy to me -- but it's very nice to have, especially on prepaid so you don't burn through your minutes on data. The phone can use apps, but only Java apps. What that equates to is this: remember browsing mobile web on your flip phone in the early/mid 2000s? The apps and browser on this phone are pretty much just like that, except your using a touch screen instead of keys. Mostly text with an occasional small graphic here and there. Facebook is the only thing I HAD to have on my phone... and luckily, as soon as I loaded Facebook in the browser, it notified me that there was an app I could download. It's very basic, and somewhat slow... but you can still see all your Facebook content, and you still have an impressive set of features for such a basic phone. I could still check in, check my notifications, like statuses/comments, send inbox messages... if you're not obsessed with Facebook or smartphones and just want to use it occasionally, this would definitely be enough for you.The rest of the features on the phone aren't bad either. For being a basic phone, the music player operates well and has a decent volume and sound quality coming from the external speaker. It also has a standard headphone jack, which is a great feature -- you don't have to get an adapter for headphones. Just plug in your existing pair and jam away! However, keep in mind this is not a very powerful phone... so if you insert a 16 GB microSD card full of music and photos, the phone will take longer to sort through everything. It doesn't freeze up the phone immediately or anything... but once you open the Music Player or Photos option, it will say \"Loading\" while checking the microSD card, and you have to wait for at least 30-60 seconds before it finishes and begins operation. However, once the music player gets going, it operates fine and stops lagging. Photos, on the other hand, is never speedy. Each photo takes a few moments to load and the app overall is tedious and time consuming. But then again, that's probably ok for most because this phone wasn't designed for photographers. :)Call quality is decent -- but keep in mind it's a GSM phone, and GSM call quality is inherently poorer quality than CDMA. Voices aren't quite as crystal clear as they are on Verizon... but I had no problem understanding anyone, and the volume levels available for the earpiece were more than adequate. The speaker phone is also fairly decent. The volume didn't get quite as loud compared to using it on the earpiece, but it will still be totally usable unless you're in a very loud environment. The mic on this phone picks up your voice fairly loud though... when recording my voice mail greeting, I held the phone about 4-5 inches away from my face so it didn't sound like I was yelling! Speakerphone quality is good in that respect -- my voice was recorded at a more normalized level when using speakerphone, but very loud when using the phone traditionally.Battery life, as to be expected with a dumb phone, is pretty great. I played around with the phone for hours and hours the first night I got it, and after sitting overnight without charging, it was still 2/3 full the next day.Overall, this is a great phone. If you're expecting a smartphone, it will disappoint you... but if you want a basic phone that works well and has a lot of nice little extra features, and a touch screen to boot, this is the one for you. All the other positive reviews aren't lying! If your expectations are reasonable for this phone, you will probably love it.** Something to note: TracFone customer service reps are notoriously outsourced and poorly trained. As a result, the language barrier compounded with the lack of proper training (or competency?) makes customer service a nightmare. SOLUTION: If you are having a problem finding resolution by calling, message TracFone via Facebook. I saw someone mention this online and tried it, and they messaged me back willing to help within 15 minutes -- ON A SUNDAY. I had waited overnight for this new phone to be activated and still nothing. After replying with the new phone's serial number as requested, she messaged me back within 20-30 minutes and asked that I power cycle the phone and try a test call. Not only did the phone work, but I was assigned a new number as I had requested! That was a big deal to me, because I had tried to change it previously, I was without a phone for three days and when it finally started working again, I had the same number! Obviously, I would assume you can't message them on Facebook for every little question or with things of a confidential nature, but if you have tried and failed with phone support, it doesn't hurt to give them a shout on Facebook.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG840G", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R2TDIHBATG8098", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG840G is defiantly a step up from the previous phones tracfone has offered.

Did free super saver shipping and received it earlier then expected. Seems the only negative comments are from people who don't have service in their area ( make sure you check their service map if your going to be a new user on the network) and from people who couldn't activate it which is the easiest thing to do.For current Tracfone users.When you transfer your phone over do it on the tracfone website- much quicker.I would also make sure to have a significant amount of minuets because when you do transfer on to this triple minuet phone your existing minuets will triple,  10 free mins, and 60 extra service days.For new users- questions i had about this phonewifi is free- as long as your connected, either at home, or starbucks or where ever has wifi and you can connect you will not be charged for anything except phone calls (obviously)Email and browser speed depends on your wifi connection ( just like a laptop and anything wifi capable)No there are no awesome apps like angry birds and if you must have games there is an app store- which have a few okay games ( who cares its a 45 dollar phone that does more then alot of phones)I believe you can download java apps but if your just useing it for the pleasure of having a smart phone that calls texts and to surf the web your better off on not bothering with it.Now there was very little I disliked but for having average sized hands this phone seemed pretty small and thin- though it feels durableThe keyboard in the browser ( not text) was kind of annoying but im pretty sure you can change it, and i wish it had a frount camera and maybe more pre-downloaded utility apps - Facebook messenger? Skype (if it had a front camera)This phone comes with basic accessories - the obvious charger, back, sim card and battery.

This isn't an Android or iPhone.  It has it's own proprietary operating system.But, if you are a loyal Tracfone user, and if you, like me you want a cheap phone solution, this is perfect for you.  This review is for the average user, so I won't talk about loading 3rd party apps or messing with the operating system.The phone provides basic phone functionality, plus has a web browser that will connect via wifi to save your minutes.You can program the email app to connect you your email (I have both Yahoo and Gmail).  One drawback is that the calendar app does not connect to outside calendars.  Nor does the favorites connect with your email favorites either.  These would be great future upgrades, or I would even pay for apps that do that.Takes photos and videos.  You can load your own photos and music onto the microSD card.  It took a couple of tries, but I got it to work correctly.The app store has just ringtones and a few games (the Texas Hold'em is ok).  Demo versions of Uno and a driving game are free.The touchscreen works pretty good, but it times out quicker that the setting indicates.  There's a pulldown with music player, bluetooth activation, alarm, silent mode, and wifi activation.  Then there are three screens section buttons: \"contacts\" (your favorite contacts), \"widget\" which allows you to have a permanently displayed clock, calendar, and a few other things you can choose from, and \"shortcut\", which basically is a page of your favorite apps.  At the bottom are icons for dial, contacts, messaging, and apps.  There is a call, back, and hangup touch buttons at the bottom.Some apps will allow you to display in landscape, but there's no sensor, you have to activate from the menu, and it resets to portrait when you exit.  The browser is ok, a little tricky to scroll with your fingers; sometimes it zooms instead, even though there's also a button for that.I tried to play a YouTube video, at first is didn't work, but then it did, albeit a bit small.Documentation is limited, but there are a lot of forums out there.  One thing they don't tell you is the security code is factory set to 0000.  I guessed that one and reset it to my own code.

However, I \"upgraded\" to this phone from an old flip-phone. It does not work well where I live, yet the flip did! My husband got the LG 840G and we both have phones that barely get service where we live. Tracfone would not offer a reason for this problem, and frankly their customer service is very frustrating. Prepare to spend at least 30 minutes to try to explain what is going on. Or keep reading.Talking to Radio Shack helped to reveal what was up - the LG phones that are configured for TracFone (\"G\") use AT&T; and the older (\"C\") phones (Motorola) used Verizon! Verizon is all that works well in our area. AT&T; barely gets a signal.TracFone has two coverage maps. One is for Code Division Multiple Access, (CDMA) which is older technology. The other is for Global System Mobility (GMS), which is the norm now for world phone usage.Here are links to the two maps, read 'em and don't buy these phones if you don't see good coverage for your area:[...][...]I hope this helps someone before they invest in a year's service and find out this phone doesn't work where they live.

It really eats up the battery because at my home the signal is weak so it searches a lot. Have to charge it every day. Does better out and about. I called them on it since my last phone did the same thing and when I called they did something that improved the battery life considerably, they just sent me a new battery free gratis this time, but it was not the problem. I was hoping time between charges would get better as the battery got excercised, but it seems a little worse now.I had about 1200 min left on my old Tracfone that died and they moved them to this phone with no real hassle.One problem that came up was that they had to send me a different SIM card (most likely because of my location) before I could use it or port my minutes and phone number, but it arrived in a day via FedEx, and to Alaska that is no small feat.When I went to activate and move minutes I did have the direct phone line from \"get-human\" (dot com). Got a real english speaking person who was very helpful and we worked our way through the new sim card and moving minutes. Normally moving minutes to a new tracfone can just be done on their website with a few clicks, but perhaps the HSN promo had something to do with it.As for the phone itself, texts are the regular Tracfone .03 min per text, but it breaks my longer texts into several pages so it seems to take more minutes than the last phone I had. On the old one (Motorola EX124G) I could write a very long text and it only went as one, this phone will often make them 2-3 pages. Photos in texts can really eat up the minutes, though! When I send a photo it can cost anywhere from 3-6 minutes per photo/text. If I send the same photo to several people at once I have seen it eat up 8-10 minutes, so texting photos is reserved for special occasions now.The rings can be pretty loud and the vibration is much stronger than my old phone. I missed most of my calls because the old phone was not loud enough and I could not feel it vibrate. The first time this new one went off I thought I had bumped into the electric fence it gave my hipbone such a jolt!The best feature about the phone is that it has a choice of text sizes for old fogies like me. I no longer have to take my glasses off to read the phone, everything is in nice big text. The screen leaves a lot to be desired because of it not being super fine resolution, but it is clear enough. You can see a sort of texture / fine hairlines if you look close. If you want an iPhone clarity you are not going to like it.The camera is only 2 megapixel and I thought that it would be poor quality, but even on the computer the photos look decent. I wouldn't trade my real camera for it, but it is good enough for taking occasional photos in good lighting. The videos are \"OK\", but again, 2mp doesn't allow for a very big video without pixellation. Here is a sample I took and put on YouTube, even if you change it to 720p it is not great.  [...]For sending texts it has a regular qwerty keyboard, somewhat like an ipod/iphone. Putting in contacts has the old 123, abc PIA method. Fortunately you don't have to do that too often.One other annoyance/negative (to me anyway) is contacts are sorted by first name. I can't find any way to sort by last name unless I go through and put all my contacts back in with last name in the first name field. I find sorting by first name unintuitive and just plain idiotic. I often contact several family members with the same last name and have to scroll all over to get all the names. If they were sorted by last name it would be a non issue.The browser is kind of meh. I have tried it on the house wifi and it works, but is not very user friendly. Very slow. Doesn't like to go to some pages and browsing is just reserved for necessity. You are not going to use this like an iPhone for browsing. It has been able to fetch my email decently, showing headers so I can download only what I want to spend the money to download. That will be nice when we are on the road. I do find that the screen can be a little over sensitive at times. Just handling the phone with the screen unlocked often makes random calls, including 911, or takes you to other odd pages. Sometimes I swear I didn't even touch it and it makes a call. I highly suggest enabling the screen lock.If you keep an eye on Amazon you can get the 400 min 1 year card for $79-$89 and with this phone that would be 1200min + you can always find a promo code for another 60-200 minutes (just Google Tracfone promo code) to add to it when you put the minutes on the phone. So I generally only spend $80-$90 per year for phone service. It is just an inexpensive phone with decent features for the price of the phone and minutes. Good enough for me, but I will certainly try something different when this one dies.If you have any questions I will try to answer them. If you found this review helpful please give a thumbs up!

I always note down the balance of my minutes when I shut it down. When I next power it up, I always noticed that a minute or two would disappear from the balance. This may not seem a lot, but would total 700 minutes per year stolen from you.At first I thought that the phone automatically used the 3G to receive my emails or turned on the built in browser. To prevent that, I deleted my email account from the 840G and used only my home laptop for emails. I also left it on the Shortcut page when shutting down because the browser is not on the Shortcut page and should not be turned on. I also left the wifi in activated mode when shutting down so that it would automatically connect to my home wifi router when I power it up. In this way, I hoped that it would not automatically start the browser with 3G when I power up the 840G. Despite these precautions, the phone continue to steal my minutes. Mind you, I have not installed any apps at all, except filling some 60s oldies songs in the music player. Also, I have not given anyone this new phone number nor received any phone messages or spam calls.I am retired and make one or two phone calls per week with this Tracfone, all local calls. For other calls, I use my landline. I bought the Tracfone mainly for emergencies, in case of car break down, as almost all public phones have now been removed from streets and highways.I think that this Tracfone LG840G is programmed to take away minutes when the owner does not use it to make phone calls for days in a row. Or maybe the software on it has gone kaput; big mystery. But I feel cheated. This 840G model is a beauty, but a pickpocket. When the remainder of the 60 days expire, I will not refill it, though I still have over a thousand minutes that were transferred over upon activation. I'll just pass this over to a kid to use as mp3 player, or the camera for fun.Those of you in similar situations as me might want to test it out yourself.

At forty bucks with triple minutes for life, the 840G is just cheap enough to have for minimal use, plus, you get all kinds of useful features if you need them.Some of the features I found useful were wifi, email, and Facebook.  On my old phone, I could only use email and Facebook on the raggedy browser it had while using minutes.  The 840G's wifi works great, and can save you plenty of minutes.  Email and Facebook work pretty good.  The default web browser works okay, but I get lots of tapping on the screen with nothing happening.I installed Opera, which generally works a little better, but there are also times when the default browser works better.  So, I wind up going back and forth between the two.  For example, the free wifi at the airport redirects you to a Terms of Use acceptance page where you have to click an Accept button before you can use it.  Opera won't open that page, but the default browser does.  So, I can only use the default browser at the airport.The Pros:-Very inexpensive to buy and use.-Reliable, good sound quality.-Some very useful features, if you need them.The Cons:-Lots of tapping with nothing happening in the default browser.-No phone number reject or block list.-The camera snaps the shot a second or two after you click the button.  I know lots of cameras do this, but they're all annoying.  Snap the picture when I click so I get what I wanted when I clicked.-The camera only zooms at lower resolutions.-No parabolic mirror next to the camera eye for self-pics.This isn't really a Pro or a Con, but when you're using an Internet feature, the wifi takes a few seconds to connect after unlocking the phone.  So, if you start your Internet app before it does connect, you'll connect to your phone network and use minutes.  So, you just have to wait for the wifi icon to appear after unlocking before you start the app.The bottom line is that this phone, with triple minutes, plus a 400 minute/365 day card (1200 minutes for a year) from the same seller for ninety bucks, is a great deal for somebody that just needs to have a cell phone on them at all times, but doesn't use it much.  Being able to also use the extra Internet features by wifi is a great bonus.Update, 8/6/2013:Downgraded from four stars to two stars.  Everything I said about this phone a few months ago was true at the time.  Since then, my work email accounts can only receive, not send, and Gmail doesn't work at all.  I've been through the settings over and over, and the accounts only stopped working on the phone, nowhere else.  Most likely, Tracfone blocked the ports used to minimize traffic.  I emailed to complain, and was told my issue could be only handled by phone.  Also, half the time, neither web browser works right.  They don't connect, tapping the screen does nothing, etc.  A few months ago, they worked as described initially, above.In my initial review, the bottom line was that the 840g using Tracfone service was a good inexpensive phone and service, with some extra good features.  Now that the extra features are gone, it's just an inexpensive phone and service that works adequately.  As far as an inexpensive phone and service goes, it doesn't even have a block list.  And, when using a headset, the sound is choppy and unusable, unless the music player is running.  Adequate phone and adequate service for a low price.

If I ever do upgrade my phone, I was thinking of this one.On the surface, it looks like a really nice phone. It has Wi-Fi (huge feature for Tracfones as they never have it before), a good quality touch screen, and comes with and SD card (only 2GB, but they never used to with anything)! It seemed like a high quality phone in general. However, when I dug deeper, I noticed that a lot of features are missing and the phone is not an upgrade over my 500g AT ALL.1.  The call recorder is GONE. They removed the feature! I have looked everywhere, it simply does exist. The phone has a voice recorder, but that can't be used while you are in a call. This is feature is deal breaking for me. When I get calls with important information, I record them so everything is captured. I don't want to have to take notes (and it's not even always possible, like while driving) or miss something that is said. It's just not as efficient. My 500g had this, so why not the 840g!?2. They removed the previewing of new, unopened text messages. You must open them the whole way to see what they say now. On the 500g, it would show you a little bit, even before you opened it. This was so useful because it saved me minutes not having to open things like \"OK\" or \"be there\" or other really short things. Now you need to open every message to see what it says, even if it's just a dot. Put the feature back!3. The keyboard is never used by default, and for some forms of entry, completely missing. The only time the keyboard appears automatically is when sending text messages, otherwise the text entry mode is keypad, even when it makes no sense, like making notes. To switch to keyboard, it takes 3 clicks. It may not sound like much but if you plan to do any typing or text input it gets old fast. And if that wasn't bad enough, the keyboard is unavailable for places it seems necessary, like for typing Wi-Fi passwords, renaming files, and the calendar. Who is responsible for this!?4. When you put profile photos for contacts, it doesn't simply take them as - it requires you to crop the head out. The crop size is quite small even at the \"largest\" size, and it took 3 tries to get a single photo pic for a person because the original photo and even the phone's camera were making images that were too close to use. Ridiculous. I had to find a headshot that was really tiny in a large resolution picture. Way too much work for what should just be crop or use full image. It also uses a square crop aspect ratio, which is odd because nobody has a square head. Either you chop off some hair or their neck.5. The camera is the same Tracfone low quality.  However, now you get 2 megapixels of it, not just 1. Seriously... no autofocus, no improvements? It looks like nothing was improved from previous generations.6. The \"Call Reject\" feature is missing as well. Previously you could block who calls you, either all calls, those with no caller ID, unregistered, anybody in your contacts, or contacts in a group. Not anymore. What do we, as users, gain from this!?7. The fonts are kind of large, even at the small size, and almost ugly looking. I really don't appreciate them.8. Settings all over the place and somewhat sparse. I wish they were all consolidated in one place. They've also removed the Profile feature, which makes making changes to your ringtone volume and other common settings fast.9. The phone takes 30 seconds to start... it feels like molasses. It also prompts you when you turn it off, with no way to disable the prompt.I would never recommend this phone. It looks like an upgrade at first, but what kinds of upgrade cannibalizes past features!? Like my 500g, it's also an LG, so I expected some consistency. This is the usual Tracfone phone quality - feature phone with basics, but with the basics missing. A lot of these problems could be fixed with a software/firmware upgrade, but Tracfones don't have the ability to update themselves, and I doubt updates would ever get issued in the first place. This is their 3rd or 4th touch phone, and so far, TF can't get it right.

Bernadett", "ReviewID": "R2IZGTONKME5N4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros:  Not bad for $15/mo.Cons:  Keypad/T9 layout comes up too often, when QWERTY would be appropriate.  In some places QWERTY is not offered as an option, so Keypad/T9 must be suffered (this is the fault of the app).BIG COMPLAINT:  Tracfone purposely makes it confusing to try to get the most minutes for your dollar.  First, you should use their website and avoid purchases over the phone or in stores.  Then you need to learn their system in order to optimize your purchase.  First you select a 'card' with a base service time and minutes for a certain price, then only if you proceed to the next page do they give you a 'supersize' option to add more minutes or more time at a different, usually lower, rate.  Try a few combinations and compute the total minutes per dollar before committing to a purchase.  Also, check tracfonereviewer.com to get a current promo code for the 'card' you've selected.  It's like the game of Let's Make a Deal!  I recommend a spreadsheet if 10-15% makes a difference to you.Also beware that all orders are FINAL, no refunds or changes.  Obviously I failed to optimize one of my transactions, and bought a 450-minute 'card' when I would have done better with a 200-minute 'card' with a 200-minute 'supersize' added.  I called customer service in India, and was told to take a hike.  You would think I was trying to unwind a bad stock trade or something.This is my third tracfone.  I started 4 years ago with a Moto370, then LG420, and now this one.  Each one was an upgrade from the last.  It's not a smart phone, technically it's a J2ME device, but it benefits greatly from the standard set by Apple and Google.  However since it gets much better battery life than the smart phones, it's a good compromise between a smart phone and a long-lasting feature phone.This phone has both WiFi and 3G, both of which work well for browsing and apps.  I've confirmed that when WiFi is connected, you're not charged any minutes for browsing and web apps.  You can leave WiFi switched on in the menus, and it'll automatically switch off and on when you sleep or wake up the phone, saving your battery.  When you wake up the phone, it'll check for the strongest saved WiFi net and connect to it within about 3 seconds.  And you can switch off WiFi easily to further save battery while you're out of WiFi range, or within WiFi range but just talking, texting, or using non-connected apps like notepad, calendar, calculator, stopwatch, games, music, camera, etc.The built-in browser is fairly impressive for an on-phone browser in a lightweight (low power consumption) device like this.  It'll handle my Yahoo web mail, Google, Amazon, Wapipedia (Wikipedia reformatted for mobile), and most sites that have a separate mobile 'version'.For large, non-mobile-friendly sites, or others that just don't work well with the built-in browser, I recommend installing Opera Mini V4.5, and adding the Java Keypad hide option as outlined in another review here.  I tried Opera Mini 7.1 and found it too bloated for this device, although one possible advantage of 7.1 is that it has its own QWERTY on-sreen keyboard.  Be advised that Opera Mini is a server-based browser that renders pages on its own servers out on the web, and feeds your phone compressed images of the pages for interaction, so you can't use it for internal, 'intranet' sites.The best app I've gotten so far is Google Maps, which works just as well in 3G as it does in WiFi on this phone.  Get the signed version with the local Java keypad removed, from [...]  The version you get from m.google.com isn't signed, and pops up 'untrusted midlet' warnings every 5 seconds or so (every time it loads data).  You can zoom in and see labeled attractions and businesses, you can use the satellite and street views, and you can turn on the live traffic overlay much like the full browser-based version.The built-in e-mail app was easy to set up with my Yahoo e-mail account.For 3G, it appears you're only charged for data transferred, as mentioned in other reviews.  About 2 units for a quick e-mail check, and 3 units for a quick check of Google Maps traffic.Caveats:I couldn't find a setting to leave incoming e-mail on the server for reading and deletion from my normal webmail browser interface.  This means new incoming e-mail appeared on the phone but didn't appear on the webmail interface.Between the built-in browser and the e-mail app, I wasn't able to come up with a satisfactory interface for deleting incoming mail, but at least I was able to read it with the built-in browser.  Later I go back to the webmail with a PC browser to delete mail, move it to folders, or handle attachments.The e-mail app doesn't have a spam filter, so you would need to be able to adjust spam filtering upstream of POP or MAPI access with your e-mail provider.There is no browser plug-in for displaying PDF documents.  I've seen evidence of a PDF display app., but it's not available from Adobe apparently, maybe shareware.It appears that the bluetooth functionality is limited to headsets only.  I tried an external bluetooth keyboard, and it paired with the device, but when I tried to select it, it said 'connect headset only'.  (Update)  Bluetooth may also be used to transfer your contacts between tracfones. I was able to transfer my entire contact list from my old LG420 to this one in one operation.If you haven't had a touch screen phone before, try to remember to hit the button on top to put the phone to sleep before you put it in your pocket.  Otherwise it'll butt-redial your last contact almost immediately.  Also, when you power it on from a cold power-off, don't just get it started and put it in your pocket, because when it finally boots up completely, it'll be unlocked and butt-redial same as above.My wife found the settings to use the QWERTY keyboard layout by default for URLs in the built-in browser and for text messages, but for Notepad I have to change it from Keypad/T9 to QWERTY every time.  Also, Opera Mini 4.5 brings up the Keypad/T9 layout for URLs and text entry, and I've found no way to select the QWERTY layout!  In general this phone (the apps, really) frustratingly keep using Keypad/T9 in situations that call for QWERTY, which is available on the phone but underutilized!Recommended Accessories: EZOPower Extra Long 6ft Black Micro-USB 2in1 Sync and Charge USB Data Cable for Samsung, HTC, LG and Other Smartphone, or EZOPower Extra Long 6ft White Micro-USB 2in1 Sync and Charge USB Data Cable for Samsung, HTC, LG and Other SmartphoneYou'll need a micro-USB cable to connect the phone to your computer to move pictures, music and apps onto it (and move pictures off, I suppose).  It appears on your computer as a regular USB mass storage device, with steps to enter and exit that mode on the phone.  This gives you access to both the phone's internal storage, and the microSD card, without having to open up the phone and take out the microSD.  This cable also charges the phone while it's connected to a computer or USB power outlet.  No USB cable is included with the phone, only an AC charger.  The micro-USB cable from my son's Google ASUS Nexus 7 worked just fine while I had this cable on order.  I also got this phone in white for my wife, and the white USB cable to go with it.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dumped AT&T;", "Author": "Sacredtouch \"Chi\"", "ReviewID": "R1988QVAAY77BT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was paying AT&T; around $200/mo for 2 iPhones sharing 350 minutes per month (which we never exhausted). I decided to dump AT&T.; I do still use my iPhone over WiFi at home with the Talkatone app for free/cheap calls & texts (I work at home) but I needed a phone to use away from home. I purchased the 840g here, then found a really good package deal with 1400 minutes/triple minutes/1 year of service on a site that offers \"flexpay\" and bought that with the intention of returning this one. I then decided to keep it for the extra battery, charger cable and battery cover. I just swap out the battery when it runs down. Battery life is really good compared to the iPhone, which I have to charge daily even if I don't use the phone. I like the touch screen. Its value is basically swifter menu navigation. I don't use the 3g browser unless I want to kill 5 minutes or so when I am waiting for someone in my car. The web browser's home page links are crowded together and it is too easy to hit the wrong link, causing the browser to load the wrong page. Then you have to clumsily navigate back to the home screen and try again. Pros: A good, solid phone for texting and talking and 3g web access if nothing better is available. I like that the ringer volume is nice and loud (adjustable). Battery life is great. Cons: 1) Text messages are not displayed in a continuous scroll as on a smartphone. Instead, the Tracfone screen pops up, confirming how much you were debited for each message sent. 2) The battery cover is the most brittle, cheap plastic imaginable. Glad I have a couple of extras in case this one cracks. 3) There are no cases specifically for this phone. I use a cheap leather pouch (B009HOSU8E) for mine then slip it into my purse.

Richards", "ReviewID": "R2DGIDG9QZTF0U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall, this is a decent phone. I bought it because Tracfone had refurbished models for 10$ and my keyboard on my other phone was kind of glitchy making texting a pain, so I thought I'd give it a try for that price. Basics: It has triple minutes (I buy 1500 tripling to 4500 once a year.) It is touch screen- no slide out keyboard which I wish it did have. Camera, video, works on GSM (AT&T;) towers. Wifi, bluetooth, a couple apps a 2GB micro SD card for music. It has a nice large screen that is easy to use and see, similar to using an iPod touch.Texting: this is basically what I use a phone for. You can make SMS texts up to 5 pages long, it sends them as so many pages but you don't have to start a new text every 160 characters. You can add a picture, music, video or other files to SMS texts, otherwise it will send them as SMS rather than MMS, it doesn't give you a choice which kind you want to send beforehand. As usual with tracfone you don't get to see who's texting you until you open it. I don't really like the touchscreen keyboard, I keep hitting the wrong keys. Also when you try to scroll through stuff like templates it's nearly impossible because every time you touch the screen it thinks you're selecting something. It has autocorrect, but I have that turned off. It's useful to have a stylus.Calling: If you live in an area with good AT&T; coverage calls are fine.Browser: I don't use this because it takes up tons of minutes and most websites don't actually work or show up correctly because there's not a real operating system. Works fine to check email or facebook messages though.Camera: Camera is 2MP but doesn't take great pictures. There's no zoom, unless you are using a low resolution, which is silly, why would you want to take low res photos to be able to zoom? There are lots of adjustable features, however, such as brightness, white balance, night mode, color effects like mono, sepia, negative, blue, a timer, normal or continuous shot mode. Plus you can edit pictures you've taken or downloaded with frames, flip, rotate, resize, add an image like a crown or a heart etc. to the photo, change the colors, adjust brightness, contrast, hue etc., add a filter such as sharpen, emboss, water color, sketch, neon, cartoon etc., draw with a pen, add text, crop, or add a stamp. You can also print via bluetooth.Video: Basically the same settings the camera has to take the video, plus the ability to zoom.Functions: Screen locks after a set period of time (you can adjust the amount of time) You push a button to turn the phone back on, and slide the lock up to unlock the screen. There's a \"home\" button at the bottom left on the screen. You can set contacts to shortcut to from the main screen, and you can set shortcuts to the widgets like email or messaging. There are also 4 buttons in a bar on the bottom of the home screen to make calls, go to contacts, go to texts or go to the widgets screen. You can scroll through widgets using this bar, or click on the apps button to go to the apps screen. If you don't want to add a widget to your shortcuts but want to easily access it for a period of time, you can slide it from the bar up to your wallpaper and it will stick on the main screen until you slide it back to the bar. These widgets include prepaid, where your phone/minutes info is located, contacts, messages, dialing, recent calls, games, calendar, camera, video camera, alarm, browser, settings where you can change the display, call, phone, and touch settings and sounds, email, SNS (facebook, twitter, myspace), voice recorder, file manager (photos, videos, music), pictures, music player, notepad, audio, video, sound settings, wi-fi, bluetooth, calculator, tip calculator, stopwatch, unit converter and tasks.Ringtones: You can add your own ringtones, but for some reason you are limited on file size. I put several ringtones on the phone that I'd had on my other phone, and all but 4 of them were blocked from being set as ringtones because the file size was too large, even though they were only about 16 seconds long and I'd used them as ringtones before. On my old phone, I kept the volume set at medium. I have this phone set all the way up and I can still barely hear it when I play the ringtones. It seems loud enough when the alarm goes off though.Contacts: You can add photo ids and ringtones and emails etc for specific contacts. But unlike every other phone I've ever used you have to crop the photo to a little square. You can move the square where you want on the photo, but you don't get to resize it the size of the square is what you get. Which is annoying. There are message and call icons next to the contact name in the list, so you don't have to click on them to send them stuff. And, as I said, you can add your frequent contacts to the shortcut on the home page and not have to go into contacts at all.Bluetooth: This works fine, I transferred several files between the phone and my computer as well as my other phones and had no problems.Case: I got a case because I like the colors, but you really don't need one for this phone. The screen isn't covered by a case anyway, and the back cover is textured so you don't see scratches or fingerprints for the most part. And a case is only going to give you minimal breakage protection.Battery: I still have a full charge though I've been playing with the phone for a few days. But I'm not a heavy user so I don't know how long it lasts with frequent calls/ texts because I just got it.There are tap sounds when you touch things on the touch screen that you can turn off or change.When you enter info into contacts etc, the default entry method is keypad, but you can change it to keyboard. You can also add things to your dictionary and change between English and Spanish languages.Managing calls: One of the reasons I liked the AT&T; phones I've had on tracfone was the ability to block numbers from calling or texting me, so I didn't keep getting the same sales calls etc. This phone does not have the option to do that. And the lack of that feature when it was on the other phones knocked it down a star, because it was one of the two selling points for choosing AT&T; over Verizon, along with being able to create multiple page SMS texts, if the network works equally well for both in your area.So overall, it seems like a decent phone. If you like touchscreen keyboards, AT&T;, and don't care about being able to block numbers (which you can't do on the Verizon phones either) or take good pictures, you should like it, especially if you get the refurbished phone for 10$. It has a 3 month return window and a 1 year warranty. Though it is quite disappointing to \"upgrade\" your phone after 2 years and have to take a step backwards in functionality on many of the uses. If you've never had any of the things this phone lacks, however, you'll probably be a lot more pleased with it.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT DEAL FOR THE MONEY", "Author": "beechgirl", "ReviewID": "R82VK6VZCYF1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "However a friend just informed me both QVC and HSN offer the phone with case and charger and 1400 card to use in 1 year and triple minutes for life, all for $79.99.This means you basically get the phone for free as the 1400 minute card costs $94.99 on here.Then you have to buy the case and purchase the phone of course.

They don't try to sale you anything besides their cheap phones and simple plans, and everything they sale does what it's suppose to and does it good. They have data that doesn't consume much minutes for ebuddy or browsing, long distance is 1-800 based and costs the same amount of minutes as local calls(although they don't cover some countries like Estonia); with a huge array of nations, and there are text messages, email, and voice-mail.Now, On to this phone..THE GOOD-Triple minutes for life-J2ME based Apps, Google Earth, lots of games that are functionally on par with Android and IOS games(for small screens), IM support through ebuddy client or site-2MP camera-VGA video recording-Good coverage-HTML+Javascript+SSL capable web browser-microSD card up to 32GB and verified up to class 2 speed-Bluetooth 2.1 with all the modes enabled(file transfer, audio, contacts, modem etc..)(modem probably doesn't work)-MP3 ringtones and media player(podcasts, music downloads etc..) with good sound even in cheap headphones, compared to my high end unlocked xperia-Nice geometry, nice back plate, lots of cases and plates to buy cheap-802.11a/b/g WIFI with WEP, WPA, WPA2 support-Good battery life-Fully functional microUSB port with the exception of host mode, which is commonTHE BAD-2MP camera is cheap legacy webcam grade with no type of stabilization and even with manual white balance and light configuration doesn't pick up most dark colors, and even when it does there is heavy grain, motion blur, and fringing-Web browser dies or reboots the phone OS when you browse too complex web pages. I suspect because the phone only uses RAM, which it has very little of, for rendering and cache for storage with no pagefile/swap; I've seen this before on Java based phones, I don't get why they would just let the OS reboot instead of coding in a RAM cache-No flash(kinda expected though)-Screen has extremely low PPI/DPI, color range, and if you look at it from even the slightest angle you see gray-Screen cover material not really scratch resistant, compared to even the first generation of gorilla glass-Bad analog circuitry on the headpphone jack, tested with all types of headphones. You get buzzing if you put pressure on the plug or cross headphone wires a certain way-I can't keep it on and locked in my pocket because somehow it dials emergency or my contacts sometimes. Holding volume or power unlocks it but how it gets to contacts or dialpad I don't know. I'd like to keep it on to check time at work but can't..SUMMARY: Unless you want to deal with the fees and maintenance and activation of the big carrier prepaid plans, go with Tracfone and go with this phone. Carry an internet device separately though that has flash and can handle any website; like a cheap tablet or 7\" netbook. You can actually likely use this phone as a modem for it over USB and BlueTooth.

Koller", "ReviewID": "R1B4C5EDV5JQRO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been a Tracfone customer for almost seven years. My first phone was a Motorola C139 (2.5 years). My next phone was a Motorola w376g (3 years). My third one was an LG231c (1.25 years). While my last phone worked fine, I wanted something that was as close to a smartphone as possible without breaking the bank. And truly, this is it.The phone is amazingly beautiful looking inside and out. Smooth black casing, clear touchscreen, crisp menus and pretty icons. The touch screen's responsiveness varies, but overall I love it. While it relies heavily on an alphanumeric keypad like older phones, it's several times faster to use. My advice for anyone having problems would be to rely more on your index fingers than thumbs.The operating system is a Java-Based proprietary OS. I'm still learning it, but it comes with a mobile browser, java based app compatibility, a standalone email client, camera, video camera, music player, video player and then your miscellaneous cellphone tools (voice recorder, calculator, etc.). Most apps run in Portrait mode (though video runs native Landscape). The browser has the option to flip between Portrait and Landscape. SNS Facebook uses Landscape mode.On the subject of the keyboard, the email client and SMS texting client use QWERTY. The browser defaults to alphanumeric but you have the option to use QWERTY (personally, I prefer the former). You can swap between letters/numbers, numbers only, and symbols with ease.The built in Music Player is as good or better than the MP3 Players I have owned. It is incredibly loud and still retains good quality. The video, on the other hand, I'm still trying to figure out. As the quality goes up, the framerate drops significantly. And Youtube doesn't like this phone, so if you're buying it to play video you will be disappointed.The mobile browser is very limited, but also very powerful if you know how to use it. Familiarize yourself with all of the features first, and focus on finding as many mobile sites as possible. When you find said sites, bookmark them. I have BBC News, Google Calendar and a few other sites already bookmarked and they all open to mobile and are relatively quick.Now, the phone falls flat in one major area: It's labelled as a GSM phone, but it cannot use GSM frequencies with a Cingular/ATT SIM Card. If you have this kind of SIM Card, you can only use EDGE signals (denoted by an E on the device's signal meter), and 3G signals (denoted by a 3G on the signal meter). If you use the phone in rural areas, you might find that it has bars but still says no service, and this is why it does that. Now, I don't know how it is if it has a T-Mobile SIM Card, but I would assume it behaves similarly.The phone is designed in a way that keeps it compatible with future advancements in telecommunications, but this severely limits your use of it if you live in the Western US, at least for the moment.However, I'm not too bummed. I love this phone, flaws and all. It does everything I want it to do; that's good enough for me. I hope that it's good enough for you too, and I strongly recommend it.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome", "Author": "Words are alive", "ReviewID": "R3RITUDEJUO703", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got what i purchased for. im very glad for the speedy delivery by the seller.

You can't even upgrade the phone by downloading a very simple application that permits you to block unwanted text messages. With the LG840G, whenever you get a text message, you have to open it and read it before you can determine who it is from. If it is a spam message, you have no way of blocking that person (or spam robot) from sending you more spam text messages.Most phones do come with the ability to recognize who is sending you a text message, and the ability to block messages from unknown contacts. In fact, the previous version of Trac Phone (the LG 800G) actually DID have a feature that permits recognition of who a text message is from, and the ability to block phone numbers from unknown contacts (spammers). My suspicion is that TracFone deliberately did not add a text message blocking feature for the LG840G because they do not want you to be able to block spam calls and messages. This missing basic feature will cost you a lot of wasted air time answering calls or opening text messages to see who they are from--only to find out it is another spam. Moreover, such an application is very simplistic and would be a very simple add-on application for a a Java programmer to write. But since this basic application is (STILL) not a feature of this phone, it is probably an intentional way for TracPhone to rip off people who own the LG840G by permitting them to receive countless spam calls and messages.Too bad that TracFone does not sell a Android smartphone that can have air time replenished by buying airtime cards. Smartphones with the Android OS are very popular because the Android operating system permits access to thousands of FREE applications to download.

Another plus is that it takes excellent pictures, so I can snap away if need be and not worry about quality. This phone uses apps, which is great for a no contract phone. I will probably use that in the future, I just haven't had the opportunity yet! However, the best part hands down is the price!

I got it primarily as an upgrade from a full qwerty LG I had previously, because I liked the more modern look/feel of this phone.  The phone performs just fine, I use the phone, texting and alarm functions the most.However I REALLY miss the full qwerty keyboard and am seriously considering downgrading to get it back.  Text messages at least gives you a keyboard to use, but if you use any other function (feeding in names into your contacts, trying to input anything on the web) it's a pain in the behind - a throwback to a decade ago for input.I also have NEVER had a Tracfone that had a good web interface.  To call web browsing \"clunky\" is to be overly generous.  It is so frustrating that I really don't even bother, from simple email to just doing a Google search it is so annoying I never end up sticking with it long enough to complete!  If you know going in that you will just never be able to really use the internet on a Tracfone, then their phones are just fine - a bargain really!  I have been a Tracfone user for over a decade and it is my only phone, dumped the landline years ago.  But you really must own another device for web browsing - this just isn't it, whether it's this phone or any other in their stable.This phone, like any other Tracfones I've used, is pretty intuitive.

There is a feature on the Tracfone website that supposedly allows an existing phone number to be transfered to a new Tracfone.  This feature is useless because after all the information is submitted nothing happens. After waiting three days for Tracfone to activate the phone, I called customer service.  I was informed that I needed a different SIM card for the old number to be ported.  After 5 days I received the new SIM card via FedEx.  After installation of the new SIM card, the phone did not activate.  I called Tracfone again and after being passed around 4 times to various people who did not have a clue on how to activate the phone, finally I was passed to a lady that told me that I needed to remove the new SIM card and reinstall the one that orgiinally came with the phone.  She was able to activate the phone after 45 minutes of trying.  I would recommend the phone only with the condition that it be shipped with a new working phone number.

I am a firm believer in using this type of pay as you go service.  My $40.00+ plan with ATT left me with unused minutes that they started to take away.  Now if you are a heavy data user and use the phone all the time this may not be for you, however if you research your usage and costs it can be a benefit like I have found.  Don't have exact figures but pay less than 1/2 of what I was giving away to ATT.  Make sure if you buy on Amazon or TV you get the triple minutes.  Be aware also that you must buy \"service time\" in addition to the minutes, meaning the phone has to be activated and sometimes this is not clear in the advertising.  Look at other sites to purchase both minutes and service time, you can find some cheap deals.  The phone is reliable, clear sounding and I have less dropped calls than before.  Customer service is a joke.  I spent almost 2 hours with \"Rosie\" to switch from my damaged phone to the new one keeping the same number.  For some reason their accounting and service departments are not in sync because she kept asking me how many minutes I had left on the old phone.  Kept telling me to look at the screen when I told her the thing was damaged and I could not read anything.  Put me on hold several times to speak with accounting and said oh, you are right.  For a while thought I was going to lose my minutes but I was ok.  She also wanted info on when I bought the old phone, how long and such?

He's downloaded a few games but doesn't really use it for that purpose. Call quality is top notch, as with most Tracfones, it gets service everywhere, even in the backwoods of WV. The only qualm that my husband has mentioned would be that when he goes to retrieve it from his pocket he often accidently hits the ignore button on the touch screen and has to call the person back. It has a lock function on the top of the phone that you can activate but the screen activates itself when a call comes through. Sometimes in the process of digging it out of his pocket he presses the ignore button. Not really a big issue but kind of annoying. It has email capabilities and receives/sends picture messages (picture quality is decent, but looks grainy on the screen. I've sent them to my phone and printed them out and they actually aren't bad) but that normally burns up a lot of minutes so he rarely uses it. If it has a web browser he doesn't use it either.

It does have some annoying problems though. One of which there seems to be no solution for.First the good: The phone is cheap to buy, and with triple minutes, cheap to use. It has a nice bright clear screen that is easy to see even in sun light.  I've had no problems with coverage or dropped calls.  I have a hearing problem, yet I have no problem hearing the other party during calls and no one has told me that they had trouble hearing me.  I only use it for voice & text and for that I have no complaints.  I tried the email & browser apps once and they work okay with WiFi, but I never use them on this phone.  Also the battery life is great, it goes about 3-4 days on standby if you don't use it much.The bad:  The most annoying problem is that even when you have the screen locked, the screen comes on and it unlocks itself when you get a call.  When you carry the phone in your pocket and a call comes in the fabric of your pants will answer the call while you are trying to get it out of your pocket.  This happens every time.  By the time I get the phone to my ear the person on the other end has said \"hello? hello?\" a few times.  I've tried all the settings and searched for a solution to this online and there doesn't seem to be one.  This is the only reason I didn't give the phone 5 stars.The other problems are that the screen isn't made out of gorilla glass, rather it is some very scratch-able plastic.  If I would have known just how easily scratched this screen was I would have bought a screen protector right from the start.  If you are buying this phone, buy a screen protector.  The other issues with the phone are to be expected at this price, it isn't a smart-phone and you can't compare it to one.  If you want it for voice & text it is fine.

If you're looking for the latest iPhone or Samsung Galaxy with a million apps and bells and whistles, you'd certainly be disappointed in this Tracfone LG 840G.

It feels like a much more expensive phone.  The actual calling functions work well and are easy to figure out, easy to set up voicemail and add contacts.  It has a decent still camera and video camera functions.  It's got some simple apps like a notepad, voice recorder, tip calculator, calendar/schedule organizer, etc. You can put your videos and mp3s on it.

This phone has a lot of nice features.  While I won't be using email much, as the minutes really get eaten up, it's nice to know I can access my email, which was easy to set up.  I quickly tried to access the web, but couldn't get it to connect to my home wifi.  I will try it somewhere that offers free wifi and see what happens.  It takes great pictures that I think I can download to my computer via the usb data cable.  However, I think I threw away, by accident, the micro SD, so the pictures don't show up on the computer from the \"Pictures\" folder.  I think they might have to be on the micro SD.  Not sure about this.  I hope so because to send an email picture eats up about 5 min.  I will see if I can purchase another one.  Only negative I have found is that the screen is very sensitive so when I try to scroll through my contacts, it opens ones I am not looking for.  Maybe there is some secret to scrolling the right way.  I have also found that my reception is much better on this phone and the voices are clearer. All things considered, I would definitely recommend this phone as long as you keep in mind that it is not a smartphone and will not do all the fancy things they will do.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ex CELL ent experience so far", "Author": "RVD", "ReviewID": "R407VWIDKC83K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have only had this phone for about 4 days to date but I decided to write my review on what I have seen and used so far. I decided to move to using  Tracfone service where you purchase minutes as needed vs. paying monthly for a set amount of voice and/or data time as I had been in the past and this phone seemed to be a good choice for me. My old LG phone was quite a few years old but it still worked pretty well on my old carrier's system for making and receiving calls.  The first thing that impressed me with Tracfone was the phone number port transfer operation. Tracfone did the  moving of my old cell phone number over from my old cell service/phone to this one. It went very well and only took around 3 hours to complete. I then worked with customer service and got my phone activated. After entering several code numbers they gave me I could here my phone come to live next to me.  And  I think the only reason I needed to do that extra step was I purchased my phone elsewhere. My guess is phones purchased directly from Tracfone are pre-setup for the most part when they arrive at your house. Signal strength around my home area is pretty good and seems to correlate with the service maps I looked at before deciding to buy this phone/service.  My first LG 840G test was its Bluetooth compatibility with my car. After putting a couple of contacts into my new phone  I paired the phone up with my car's Toyota Bluetooth interface in less that a minute. I then found that I could even copy my phone's contact/address book information to my car's memory. That is something I couldn't do with my other old service which placed some restrictions/locked some phone functions such as copying data to or from my old phone. My first Blue tooth call with the LG 840G while driving was quite clear and worked well. The call recipient who i found out was actually out of town when I called said the call quality was quite clear on his end also.  on my end I didn't see any difference from the earlier test call I had made from this phone while standing in my house. And considering I was driving during the Bluetooth call, I was pretty pleased.  Although I seldom texted in the past on my old phone (partly because I would have to use its standard mechanical phone dial buttons just to create a text) I tested this phone's text capability by sending a text to a friend. It seemed like it sent it as it told me I was charged the standard text charge of .3 minutes of call time. Later I got a return text from that friend saying he had indeed received my text. As they say 'Life is good'.  I do not believe that everyone who gets this phone ends up with ATT as their backer company as I did however. I'm not sure what decides who you get. Maybe it is the area you live in?  I haven't tried setting up email yet. I don't plan on using that regularly per say but would like to set it up and test it just once so that if needed in an emergency it will be there. There are a few other features in this Java-based phone such as a 2M camera and I think you can even capture a small video if desired. The phone comes with a 2Gb memory card installed. Remember this is not a smart phone and it really should not be compared to one. There are some things like extra ringtones, etc. that can be purchased on line at Tracfone but all purchases are paid for by 'phone wampum'. ( purchases are paid for by using some of your previously purchased calling minutes).  The phone operates on a 3G network for me around here. It also has a Wi-Fi connection that can be enabled when one wants to use that. I haven't tried that out yet but will eventually do so by setting it up to connect to my home Wi-Fi .  So if you just want a decent basic phone with some extra communication features this may be a good choice for you. If you get it I would recommend also buying a protective cover for it in case you accidently drop it. Unlike my very old tank-like LG flip phone this smaller, lighter phone may be  better off with a little protection around it just in case. I got a Dynamic Hybrid Tuff Hard Case  for mine which I like a lot, but there are many different options out there. So if you are in to buying minutes and service time in advance and aren't looking for a mobile computer-like phone you may just want to check this one out. Sure it's not perfect, nothing ever is, but I'm pretty happy with its basic functionality so far and especially now knowing that any left over call time as well as service time simply will add into the next call card that I purchase and is not gone forever like the unused allotted monthly minutes in my old service's monthly plan. I almost forgot; this phone triples the minutes purchased in any offered Tracfone plan for the life of the phone. It'd be hard to pass this up for that feature alone. So if you do decide to get this phone I really think you'll enjoy it !", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone is not made for older  Seniors", "Author": "Kenn Stoliker", "ReviewID": "R3UMLHUD5RFEK7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This Phone is very touchy , and did not like it very much. went back to my LG 800 which Is working fine for me... ..", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor reception", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R1HR03U9ANG74D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Lots of good features for an inexpensive feature phone.

She wanted an iphone (what 12 year old wouldn't?) but my biggest concerns were 1) too much unnecessary \"access\" and 2) cost.  No matter how I sliced it, an iphone would cost $1,000 for the 1st year ($199 for the phone and ~$75 for the phone line, data plan, insurance, taxes and fees).  THIS cute little phone works great, looks \"cool,\" is significantly less expensive than a smartphone on a 2 year plan, and it makes my daughter have to \"think\" about what she's texting, deterring her from being on the thing all day long.  The phone cost $42 and I bought 1,500 minutes for 365 days on the TracFone website for $199+tax.  This phone automatically triples the minutes purchased, so for $250, she has a new phone with 4,500 minutes equating to ~12 minutes of calling per day, or 40 text messages (or some combination of the 2).  In my opinion, this is \"enough.\"  She's psyched to have a phone and she's pleased that the interface is what she's used to.  (She never owned a flip phone so it would be taking a step \"backwards\" to start doing the 2 thumb texting on a keyboard).  Like a real smartphone, she can access the web but again, it uses minutes so it's like a built in \"control\" that limits her being attached to it.  She's a reasonable kid so when I explained the cost of an iphone vs. the cost of this, she understood.  I'm really pleased.  I was skeptical since I don't really know anyone that has this type of phone but I think it's a great option for my daughter.

I don't need a smart phone with a data plan, just really need a decent-looking phone that is not a flip phone and this works for me. I'm happy that I will not get a bill, not tied to contracts, and no hidden surcharges. So refreshing.An update:So, the above was my review in the brief time I've owned the phone. And here's an update: I still like the phone because well the one it replaced was a Sprint flip phone. I changed my rating from 5 stars to only 3 stars now which is the median because whenever I receive a text, that's sometimes even broken up to more than 3 texts for some reason, well it removes .30 seconds per text I receive. So 2 texts received equals to one minute spent, and even though I'm hardly on the phone and I monitor my use tightly, it seems I end up spending about $29.99 worth of minutes every 2 weeks, so about $50 to $60 a month, mostly coming from unwanted incoming texts, ugh.To remedy this, I went to the tracfone website (did this tonight), and signed up for a value monthly plan, it seems the cheaper way to go..", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't believe what you read it can do-even Tracfone doesn't know anything about it!", "Author": "Karen Kain", "ReviewID": "RFDJDR1MV7QX5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It says it does a lot of things and it doesn't.

My problem is with customer service.  I'll briefly run down the two problems I've had to indicate my reason for this review.Problem 1.  The phone would not allow me to make a call after I had it about 3 months. Fortunately I still have a landline phone so I called customer service.  To begin, the connection was really bad. It sounded as though the person was standing in the waves on a beach.  I believe it was the Philippines so it was an international connection.  This required me to constantly ask the representative to repeat instructions.  She was patient and after 45 minutes the problem was corrected. Something about the SIM card.Problem 2. I was going to travel and I wanted to access my email on the phone.  Did all the set up instructions per the User Guide for the phone.  Could not connect to my gmail account.  Called customer service. Same problem with poor connection.  To make a long sad story short after 50 minutes talking to numerous people a customer service supervisor told me they could not fix the problem and I would not be able to access my email on the phone.  REALLY???There's an icon on the phone for email, but I can't use it?After I use the remaining minutes I will  recycle it and go to another carrier.

I actually prefer flip phones, but since this was cheaper and it came with triple minutes, I got this instead. Even though I prefer flip phones, I am not going to review this phone based on that fact. I will mostly be doing a comparison between the LG 840G and the LG 800G, since that was the last phone I owned.Pros:1. This is the most important one: the touch screen is much more accurate and responsive than the LG 800G. I find myself hitting \"backspace\" a lot less, and a character is printed every time I touch the screen without using a lot of force. This results in much faster texting.2. The screen is slightly larger, making it easier to see. That said, it is only just as long an just as thick as the LG 800G, and only slightly wider, so it is still a nice, compact phone.3. The battery cover is better for several reasons: A. It has a rough texture to provide a better grip. B. It is constructed out of a more durable material than the 800G. C. The cover does not slide onto the phone like the 800G, but clips directly on. This keeps it from flying off due to slight impacts. D. You don't have to remove the battery to access the SD card.4. The phone has the feature that turns the screen off when you hold it up to your ear during a call, and turns it on when you remove it from your ear.5. This phone has Wi-Fi, so now it doesn't cost you minutes when you are just surfing to get a new ringtone and what not. It also has 3G, but I am not sure what is so great about that to be completely honest, but I guess it is better than not having 3G.6. Multi-media messages cost less minutes for some reason, or maybe its just for \"group\" messages. Example: whenever a friend sent me a group message on my 800G, it would cost me 1.50 minutes. On the 840G, it costs about 1.0385 or something like that. Still a lot worse than a regular text, but not as bad as the 840G.Cons (mostly just nit picky stuff, but I don't see why some of these cons are present when they weren't present on the 800G):1. The most important con: while it is now easier to text, there is no feature that shows you possible words you are trying to type, like on the 800G.2. The difference between 0% and 100% brightness isn't that huge.3. If you receive a text from someone and their name is too long, it doesn't display their name at the top of the message. You have to exit the message to see who sent it to you. This is more confusing than anything, because I keep thinking that strangers are texting me.4. If you sent a text message by clicking on a contact, it doesn't tell you who you are sending it to. I like to be sure I am sending my messages to the right people. You can avoid this by creating the message and THEN choosing who to send it to, but that is a hard habit to start.5. Not sure if this is how it worked on the 800G, but the 840G's music player will NOT allow you to choose the first song you want to listen when shuffle mode is on.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not very good phone reception", "Author": "BeckyK", "ReviewID": "R7VS2ILRWF7FG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you live in a rural area the reception on this phone is not the most reliable.

I had my 800g for quite sometime and it has been a great phone but I've worn it out.  (I'm rough on phones).  The 840g will handle up to a 32g micro sd card also which is one of the reasons I changed phones. I have a 16gb in it now.  Works fine.  The bigger the card, the longer it will take for it to load your songs and pictures if you've got a lot on it.  I do recommend this phone. Especially vs. going to a huge monthly payment - even vs. android yet.  I just can't see the need for paying 50 bucks a month for a phone.  Right now, we are paying  right around 30 bucks a month on the tracfone family plan and have 4 phones on it and have never needed to add minutes.

The first thing you notice is that it does not feel cheap in your hands.  The build quality seems very good.  I purchased this phone for a friend that has never had a cell phone and has no need for a full blown smart phone.  I have yet to give it to him, but it appears to me that it would fit his needs perfectly.  You can send or receive 3 text messages per minute.  Also, if you have issues with trying to figure out the security PIN for the phone it seems to be 0000.  This was not documented anywhere in the manual or online that I could see.I have seen many comments regarding terrible customer service from Tracfone.  When I had the issue with the security PIN I called their customer service expecting to be on hold for a very long time.  However, I was talking to an agent within 2-3 minutes.  She was very helpful and gave me the information that I needed.  I purchased this phone with a 1500 minute plan.  It will be interesting to see how long that really lasts.I own a Razr Maxx for myself because I do use a fair amount of internet usage.  But if I did not use the internet, I would buy this phone for myself considering the phone and 1500 minutes was less than what I pay for one month on my phone.If you are just needing a basic phone for calling and texting, I don't see how you can go wrong.  Also do not count on playing games.  It comes with 2 and they are both trial versions.  You can also change the keyboard layout to use a qwerty style instead of keypad which is nice for texting.7/11/13 update - As an FYI to those that may be looking to use this also as an MP3 player, there is a limit of 2000 songs that can get loaded onto the device.  I replaced the 2GB card with a 16GB card thinking I could load a lot of my music on it.

So my use of any phone is minimal so I don't want to spend a lot on plans and fancy smart phones.  Thus, Tracfone.  It's worked fine for me for the past 5 years.  I've never had any problem activating new phones and transferring the minutes from the old to the new phone online.  I haven't really had much need to contact their Customer Service but when I do, it's been alright.  Not terrific but they get the job done.  I don't expect Apple service when I'm paying Walmart prices.Now for this phone:  I upgraded from the LG800g to this one because of the high rating it got from other Amazonians.  I was nervous because I did NOT like the LG800g.  Well, I'm happy to say that the LG840g has resolved all of the issues that I had with the 800g and added some new features that make me totally happy.  It's a little larger (maybe .25\") but the added size all goes for a larger screen.  The QWERTY keyboard when texting is so much easier and faster than the T9 of the LG800g.  Since I already was familiar with the LG navigation, adapting to the newer model was easy.  Also, it's a real sleek looking little guy.

Wifi works great on my home network and was no harder to set up then any other device I use. If you have problems, do a google search and you will find your solution. Same with downloading Opera Mini which I  recommend. Tried the standard Tracfone browser and while fast, I had a few issues with displaying some web pages. Perhaps there are shortcomings on the Opera browser, but for me it was more user friendly. Again google Opera Mini to find the correct version of Opera for the LG840. Then there is Google maps. After locating the correct version, the download went smoothly. Why use Google maps on your cellphone instead of a dedicated GPS?. Well for me it is a hassle to carry along the Garmin when 99% of the time I don't need it. If the unexpected happens or I need to refresh at the nearest pizza joint, I can pull out this cellphone and quickly locate the nearest gas, pitza or whatever. Then we got the mp3 player.

Started to activate it online, but got to a point where it said try back in an hour to see if activation went through. An hour later, still could not continue the process so I called.  Tracfone Customer Service is as bad as everyone says.  EXPECT NOTHING - don't even expect understandable English.  Expect to wait a lot.  Their favorite line \"PLease wait a moment while I access the system.\"  or \"Please wait while I investigate further.\"  The customer service reps told me some incorrect things -First off, I did not need to enroll in any program or have an airtime card at the time of activation.  They automatically give you 10 mins free plus 60 days of service.  Because I didn't know this, I enrolled in the monthly plan of 50 mins for $9.99 b/c I wanted to try things out before buying alot of service/minutes.  The phone is supposed to be triple mins. so it should have given me 150 mins but only 50 showed up.  I called Tracfone and was on the line for 43 mins getting the activation and transfer of my AT&T; number set up.Customer Support on the other side of the world walked me through it but the set-up guy told me that the monthly plan did not give you triple mins.  Shortly after I got off the phone w/them I decided to call back b/c maybe I would cancel the monthly plan if I wasn't getting triple mins.  This time the girl told me that I should be getting triple mins and after some code entering i was given those extra mins and she explained that since I got 60 days free with activation I would not be billed for the monthly plan for another 90 days. Whew!  The language barrier with Tracfone is pretty big.When I tried to transfer my AT&T; number to the tracfone the rep told me that the number that came with the phone would remain active until the AT&T; number transferred over.  WRONG.  What she failed to mention is that as soon as the transfer goes thru, your tracfone # won't work but you will have to wait a few days for the new SIM card to arrive in the mail.  So my phone worked for an hour or so and then it stopped working.  When I called Tracfone they were inept at explaining what happened.  They said my phone was defective.  I called again and someone in tech dept said they were sending me a replacement SIM card.  The card was sent via FedEx 2 day, but they were unable to provide me with a tracking number.  I would have been fine if someone could have explained all this to me but they were really not trained enough to tell me what would happen next.  As it turned out, I got the SIM card stuck it in the phone, and it worked fine and has been fine ever since.  I don't use it much.I will say a few other things for new PAY AS YOU GO users who are transitioning from a monthly service plan.  The first time I purchased minutes we were traveling and I went into a CVS and bought an airtime card.  I scraped off the paper to reveal the code and 3 numbers also came off.  By this time we were riding in a car somewhere else.  I had to call tracfone and after 45 mins on hold and being transferred around they said they were unable to figure out the missing codes and I should bring the card back to the store.  Not a possibility.  Also, on my receipt it said phone cards were non refundable.  So I played around on my laptop typing in all possibiliies of what the missing numbers could be and finally, in less time than I spent on hold, I was able to get the code right and my minutes appeared.Second time I bought minutes I tried Walmart online with electronic delivery.  The website said the code would be delivered within minutes to my email.  I waited 14 hours.  It was a weekday.  I emailed Walmart and they said that they were verifying the charge (AMEX $32) and that it would take 2-3 business days before they could release the code.  Walmart has no customer svc number on their site, only email or snail mail.  What a joke.  I always hated Walmart, now I hate them even more.  Eventually I cancelled the order b/c after 20 hours, during the week, I had no reassurance I would get the code.For the same price, you can purchase airtime right online from Tracfone's website and the code is immediate.  There is no need to support Walmart.I am still getting used to certain things, but I like the phone.  The music player is good enough.  I went to a workshop and was able to record the speaker from a few rows back and it was good enough.  The pictures/camera is very poor quality, but I have a nice digital camera.  I have not been able to access the web yet - my home wifi network takes a long time to load, and the browser is pathetic.  I have not had time to install the Opera or whatever else some other reviewer suggested.  The 8G memory card is plenty good for me too, I like the calculator, timer, stopwatch, alarm, clock and a few other gagets.

Everything about this phone is labor intensive.  I knew it would not be \"smart\", but didn't think it would be this bad even with the low expectations.  Even trying to type in contacts was a trial.

So with the very limited options, am thinking of switching to the old flip phone since that was actually easier to to search and type into...Update:  Took a week to change out phone.  Thought I'd give it a bit(didn't want the hassel).  But in the end, I had to.  The sound quality on this phone was terrible.  Could not hear on it well and others said they either could not hear me well, or I was \"staticky\". Disappointing.  (Also the battery on phone is less than desirable).Further update:  Purchased the lg530g in its place.  The key pad is perfect for my thumb nails to type a text quickly.  Sadly, can no long utilize home wireless connection or any wifi connections, but since the 840g moved so slow, don't feel I would have utilized it anyway except mini emergencies, and I can use the browser on this newer one if necessary.

I purchase the LG840 phone specifically for the WIFI which works well, although when bringing the phone out of sleep mode it takes the WIFI about 5 seconds to connect so if you tap email or browser too soon you get charged.The screen display is absolutely hideous! The LG800 has a superb display that you can view at any angle whereas this phone has a silver sheen that makes it very difficult to see at even the slightest angle and in landscape mode it's even worse straight on.The Bluetooth doesn't stay connected even though the phone sits about 4 inches away from the device it's paired with. It constantly disconnects and reconnects and drains the battery.Setting up imap email is impossible. Every time you go thru the laborious process of entering in all the information and hit connect the phone reboots and all the settings information is lost. After doing this about TEN flipping times I went in and set it up as POP3, connected and saved the settings then converted the saved setting over to imap which worked perfectly.The phone also doesn't have a NONE category in the ringtones. On my LG800 I have a couple of groups that I have set not to ring.

Sometimes my wife and I had two phones and sometimes one.  Over the years I have recommended TracFone to friends and relatives, several of which have taken my advice.  Once my minutes run out, we are done forever.  Apparently the management of TracFone feels that screwing a loyal customer out of 112 minutes is worth the loss of revenue and the bad publicity.Over the years customer service has not been great.  When I called, I expected to wait on hold for about 20 minutes and then talk to someone in India where you (or they) had to repeat things sever times to be understood.  This is what I expected and this is what I got until now.  I accepted this level of service because of the low prices and the fact that I could do a lot of things on-line.  I only had to call on the phone once every year or two.Recently a relative died and we were left with a phone with 112 minutes on it.  TracFone has a policy that lets you move minutes from a phone you are taking out of service to one that has service.  There appeared to be no way to do this online, so I waited until I had an hour of free time and called.  At the end of one hour on hold, I had to leave for a doctor's appointment, so I was forced to hang up and loose my place in line.It took me four days until I had enough time to try again.  This time my call was taken after \"ONLY\" 40 minutes on hold.  I was told that normally I could transfer the 112 minutes, but that my airtime had expired 10 hours before my second call and I would have to pay for another month of air time for the 10 minutes needed to transfer the minutes over to our other phone.  When I told them that the time was expired because they made me wait on hold for an hour, they would not listen.  They kept claiming they were not at fault and I would have to pay.  I then asked to talk to a supervisor.  I was given excuse after excuse as to why I could not talk to a supervisor.  Finally after asking six times, she said she would put me on hold and try to get a supervisor.  After a few minutes, she came back and told me that no supervisors were available and one would have to call me back.  I gave her my name and phone number and she promised a supervisor would call me back.  It has been six days and there have been no calls.  I even checked my caller ID log to make sure I didn't miss a call (I do have voicemail).So feel free to become a TracFone customer if you like dealing with a company that will keep you on hold for hours, cheat you out of money you paid, treat you like s***, and lie to you about calling back.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "UN HAPPY", "Author": "ME", "ReviewID": "R2UBE7IUVPSCT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I called 5 days in a row, hubby is critical in hospital.

Unfortunately, for the other 25%, not so good.One of my key uses is while driving. I use a wireless bluetooth Motorola speaker/mike for hands free. It worked great with my previous LG flip phone. I could activate with voice commands \"Call TK Pizza\" and the LG flip dialed it. All voice and response was through the speaker/mike. Completely hands free. Not any more.  The LG840G has bluetooth capability but won't do voice commands through my Motorola speaker/mike and apparently, most other speaker/mike devices too. I don't even see a way to dial via voice commands with just the phone.  This is a killer. When my minutes run out, I will be going back to my LG flip or hope that Trackphone has introduced something better.WiFi - one of the main reasons I decided to purchase this phone.  I travel a lot. WiFi is available in airports, restaurants, hotels, everywhere. So this would be great. I could email and get information without using minutes. Unfortunately, it sounds better then what it really is. First of all, connection to WiFi was easy. No problem. Then the issues become apparent. The browser function included is tedious and extremely slow. The screen size is too small and the resolution is too low to be usefull for browsing. You definitely need to go to the mobile version of a site you are interested at looking at. Even that doesn't always help. The screen view won't flip from vertical to horizontal if you move the phone that way. So you can't even get a proper perspective. I don't see a way to do that manualy either though there may be an option.Volume - When listening to a call I have to turn it way up to hear clearly and my hearing is fine. If your hearing is so so, stop now and look for a different phone. The LG840g on speaker however, sounds pretty good. The microphone is also decent. Folks I call have told me how clear I sound on it.Querty keyboard? Sort of. Another reason I bought the LG840 was to get away from the number/letter multi-key strike to set up new contacts etc. It turns out that the keyboard appears for various functions on the LG840G but not for all. Contrary to what some have said, you can use it to set up contacts. However, it's not easy.  \"First Name\" - select the input type from the option window in the upper right hand corner - keyboard. Low an behold, the keyboard shows up but you have to flip the phone horizontal to use it!  \"Last Name\" - flip the phone vertical and do the same selection for keyboard and flip horizontal - TEDIOUS! Again, low resolution and this is no smart phone. It's a dumb phone that looks smart.The bottom line - the LG840G looks good. That is the main idea. From a functionality standpoint, it isn't that much better. It was made to appear like a contemporary Android or Apple phone. Appearances are everything you know. Sorry no. This phone is not even a step up from my previous LG flip and I actually have lost some important (to me)functionality.  All this being said, it's still worth the money for what you get but next time I will look harder at some of the other tripple minute phones.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little phone!", "Author": "P.

It's simple, It's called adding contacts. Sure, this has a Qwerty keyboard for texting, but thats where it ends for the keyboard. If you want to put a contact in your contact list, you will have to use the old one letter at a time method to spell the entire contacts name.....UNLESS, you have another LG phone that already has the contacts in it, then you can send them over to the phone using the bluetooth feature. I had absolutely no problems bring them over from both my Net10LG500G and Net10 LG900G using the bluetooth communication. I tried to get it to work with another brand of phone and it would only send the first name in the contact to it. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, I don't know, anyway, Other that that, I'd give this phone 5 stars. I like it, it's compact, it has good battery life, the touch screen works well. You can also use it as an MP3 player, I don't, but you can. I like the size of the screen, I like the icon setup. It has the High ring to vibrate notification feature.

The first time I added minutes, I got triple minutes as promised. In conjunction with a promo code from a popular Tracfone blog, paid for 200 minutes, got 630.Call volume much better than the old phone. Every single call I have made or answered has connected.As others have written, if you do heavy duty web surfing or email, this is probably not the phone for you, but in a pinch, I can get on the web. Bluetooth found my home network easily. Speaking of bluetooth, I recently had a rental car (Nissan Sentra) with built-in bluetooth and it paired with the phone easily and worked wonderfully. I'm now exploring bluetooth options for my own car.I was able to easily install the Opera browser and google maps. Not nearly the selection of apps that are available for a true smart phone, but any java app with a .jad extension should work.For less than 40 bucks, you get about 90% of smartphone functionality, a good phone for making phone calls, cheap airtime and no expensive bills.

I have to agree with those who said it was very time-consuming and very annoying.  I went to the website and filled in all the info, and read how usually it takes only a few hours, but may take up to two days.  After four days, their website said to call Customer Service.  What a nightmare!  I got a recording saying, \"Our operators are busy assisting other callers, but to avoid waiting on hold, we can call you back in between 19 and 26 minutes.\"  I was transferred from department to department to department, each time having to start over, and always being told they needed to transfer me to someone else.  Then I would get disconnected.  I'd call back, go through the same waiting for a return call, only to be given the run-around again and again.  They'd always say, \"I don't know why they transferred you to me, this is the wrong department for you\" and transfer me again.  I got disconnected several more times.  This went on for FOUR HOURS!  Finally someone told me it was going to be activated within an hour but the next morning it was still not activated.  I had to go through this laborious process of entering strings of numbers, like 16 to 20-number strings, only for it always to say \"invalid code\" and to call Customer Service.  After two more hours of aggravation, it was finally activated, but I got only 10 minutes of airtime.  (I had read earlier that by doing it on the website I'd get 40, if I did it with the phone I'd get 20.) I'd already tried to do it that way, but was instructed to call for assistance.  Because I called, I got only 10.  Then I tried to set up voice mail. This cannot be done online, so I had to call.  I was prompted to press 1 or 2 for various choices, but each time I looked at the phone it was on the \"Low minute\" warning screen, and I had to exit that before I could make my selection of 1 or 2.  I wanted to make my own greeting, and they have various long explanations and defintions that you have to listen to before you can proceed.  I got as far as recording my name, but not my greeting, when the call was cut off and the phone said I was out of airtime.  So that's where I am now.  No phone service, no voice mail.  I have to buy minutes just to set up my voice mail.  I had T-Mobile before and things were smooth and simple.

I have had a very cheap basic Tracfone for a backup or emergency. I had extra money on my gift card for another order, I saw this and said, What the heck, it is cheap, what do I have to lose?Well I was very surprised by this phone! It is NOT a smartphone, but it is so close in my opinion, that those who have smartphone will only be mildly \"annoyed\" by the difference for such a great price.To those who do NOT have a \"smartphone\" because it may be more complex and expensive, this is the perfect middle ground or stepping stone to modern phones.If you text your grandkids and the tiny letters and having to hit the button 4 times, this phone does it on a touchscreen, which registrars every thing you press right away. You don't have to hurt your fingers anymore, especially if you have problems with arth. or other age related pains ;).Some have mentioned problems with the Wi Fi. I had no problem, I simply found the Wi Fi emblem in the menu, turned it on, chose my home Wi Fi, entered my security password(for my home internet protection) and was up and running. I think a mistake people make is they turn the Wi Fi button on the phone on and turn \"airplane mode\" on also. Airplane mode needs to be OFF. This button is there soley for when on an airplane, no need to push it for any other reason.One caution is to make sure you have a good Wi Fi connection or it will switch over to the phones \"mobile web\" which deducts minutes, WiFi DOES NOT USE YOUR MINUTES/UNITSIt is \"mobile web\" which is different than regular internet. It is not as good, but, it is more than adequate for getting news, weather, sports and all that. I installed Opera Mini and UC browsers on the phone and it is still not the full internet, yet it is really an issue of adding a few seconds to find what you want. I have Google Maps WITH street view loaded on this phone.To add things like the browser, Google Maps search for \"signed versions of opera mini browser or google maps\" you will be given a code and they can be installed in a couple minutes. I actually watched live TV news on this phone. Is the picture perfect? No. Is it good enough to watch tv or videos? YES. It is not going to be the quality of a big screen TV's, but it is more than OK for you to watch and hear it perfectly fine. If you are used to a 84 inch HD TV screen, this is probably not going to please you. If you have ever watched a Coleman TV for camping or an old Sony Watchman, it is like that, but in color and in my opinion a bit better.I know this was a looooong review, but I think this is a very good phone for the price and I may even let my contract expire and use this for my everday phone. Oh yes, and it does have a camera, which took very clear pictures of my dogs when I tried it out.I should mention that when first setting it up have your laptop or \"regular\" computer to get it going. Once it is set up as you like it works great. I HIGHLY recomend this phone. It is the best phone you can get without crossing into the $100-300 range market.

That part was OK, as I wanted a phone to talk with, perhaps some texting and also to read/send my g-mail.  Well 2 out of 3.  The LG 840 uses some version of Java as an operating system.  From reading, this was compatible with g-mail until August of 2013.  It no longer is totally compatible.  I am able to SEND mail through my g-mail account but not RECEIVE.  From the LG840 blogs, this appears to now be universal.

He is kind of behind my brother and I - as soon as I upgrade - I will try to give him my LG840G. I can go days without charging it too.  I try to shut it off at night - and if I do - it lasts even longer - almost a full week before it goes down to 2 bars. Believe me, you cannot go wrong with this phone.

Unfortunately, when you are entering new contacts, you have to do it using a phone keypad, not the qwerty keypad, so you are right back to where you were with the old clamshell design.The functions are similar to the old clamshell, so this is an easy transition to make. I don't think I will be using my valuable minutes to surf the internet or connect to facebook, by any means, but I will enjoy the easier texting capability this phone provides.Finally, beware the shipping costs for this item: I paid nearly $25 in shipping for a $100 phone! The only options were 2-3 day priority or overnight, so you're paying through the nose. Not only that, but I ordered the phone last Saturday, and this Saturday I see it listed for $27.99.

This is great looking - I look more 21st century now and it does the basics - talk, text, music, camera, video, and microphone, etc.  The internet features are a bit lame and cumbersome but they are adequate - in a pinch.  Internet is not my primary concern with this phone.  If that's what you want, pay the big bucks and go with an overpriced smart phone and plan.  I like that this little phone costs me $10/month for airtime, looks good and does 95% of what I need.  I have over 3K minutes with the triple minutes I haven't used over the years.  What's not to like??  Great little phone, transferring from another Tracfone was a breeze and the customer service is good.  One small complaint:  I'd give it 5 stars if the keyboard feature was available for EVERY function.  In some instances you have to deal with the irritation of using the abc, def, ghi then scrolling through until you hit the right key, but thankfully that is only for a couple odd notepad tasks, plus the keyboard is super sensitive, but that just may be me.  I'm not used to touch screen yet.I am having some issues with some of the buttons.  I cannot figure out how to get some of the quick select buttons on the bottom of the screen to work like music icon without going to the multimedia folder, same for the graphics icon.  For some reason, I do not have coverage in part of my house.  No signal.  May be because it's a two story house, but that stinks because my old LG505C worked great anywhere.Update:  There is an in depth user's manual on the Tracfone website under tutorials.  At the bottom left of the page is a link to the in depth user manual.  I have found that the signal is not nearly as good as some of the older Tracfones I've had - it breaks up more easily.  Over all I'm not sure I'd order this phone again.  I might spend the extra money and get a better phone.Additional update:  Tracfone deducts up to 5 minutes if you send a picture via email to yourself!

I rate them from 8 to 10. High praise indeed but earned.For some strange reason the activation codes were unrecognizable to the tracfone system and when they were finally acknowledged it said they were associated with another account. So I was fed a series of numbers, sooo long as to seem improbable, to feed into the system and that did almost fix thing. The phone activated immediately with extra months added to my one year and all the 1200 minutes + 10 extra. BUT, when I called my land line to try it out, my caller ID said my name was that of a complete stranger, not my own. Back to tracfone customer service and they said it was the fault of my internet provider; COMCAST. ... Comcast gave me a # and said if I do not hear from them in three days to call again and use the # to identify my complaint. ... I`m thinking I`ll give comcast 1 day to get back to me and, if they do not, then go back to tracfone and ask for a new cell phone number....UPDATE TO THE NEXT DAY... I did go back to tracfone customer service and had them change my cell phone number. It was done fast, in a couple of minutes, and the new number works perfectly without some stranger`s name showing up as me. But the GLITCH that caused the original failure to activate was still lurking in the system. Although patched over now, I tried to clear it to prevent future problems.

It also has a slide to unlock feature (slide the bar up instead of sideways), I do not see how you could accidentally turn your phone on.  Furthermore, the \"slide to unlock\" screen stays on for about 3sec. before disappearing (should you \"accidentally\" unlock the phone.)  Suffice it to say, you pretty much have to \"intend\" to unlock the phone to use it, no accidents there.  Yes, you can access the internet with its 3g wifi, but, honestly?  If you want to \"surf the web,\" buy a \"real\" smartphone or a computer or tablet or something.  No tracphone is intended for that use.  This tracphone will also replace my Ipod Touch as I can get a 32gb hard drive for $25, including the USB hookup and a flash drive, and upload my music from my computer onto it.

I found it was very easy to set up, easier even than the Lg 800.  I had my contacts loaded on a SD card and was able to import my contacts and not have to reenter every last one!!  The wifi is terrific.  I set up my own home network and it was very easy to get that going, I never had to look anything up.  I simply went to the wifi icon , the phone scanned the available networks, it located my network and then I input the password.  After I did that , it saved my password so I don't have to do it again.  There is a limitation with some of the java apps from get jar, a keypad pops up on every page in an app .  This cuts the screen size down by almost half.  This is not a good feature.  I am able however to go online to some of my favorite web sites and that makes this a great phone for me.  I found the call quality to be good, am able to hear the other callers.  It was really good to get the 2 gig micro sd card.  The photos are not too bad however don't expect too too much, it's only a 2 megapixel camera .  The display screen is very bright and colorful, photos received by mms look very good on it.  This phone has triple minutes for life which is good as the mobile web can use quite a few minutes up.  The 3 G service is appreciably faster than the 2G which I had previously.  All in all, this is a good upgrade for tracfone from the LG 800 G.  Now, if they could only get an android phone available, even one with the older operating system, I keep hoping.I found purchasing from this dealer on Amazon to be very good.  I ordered my phone very late on a Thursday night and my phone arrived on the following Sat. at noon!!", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Vince   DiVarco", "ReviewID": "R1VCG2RF30ZXK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this phone, slim, compact,fair battery life and triple minutes don't hurt.Some features I will never use, but nice to have if i ever need them.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thanks", "Author": "Marlene Golden", "ReviewID": "R2U1Z1NGT124KK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the phone been wanting a touch screen for myself for a while, it meets all the standards.

The interface is worse than the standard browser but happily it solved all the page drawing problems the 840G had with one particular website that I use a lot.If Opera Mini didn't fix the problem I would have returned this phone, used the 800G and shopped for another phone that could handle that particular website.

The wifi was a bonus I guess but not sure how much I'll use it. The browser it pretty lame and I might try the wifi to do a Facebook check in without using units but otherwise not really worth the hassle. I can send a tweet to Twitter via text. One disappointment is that the lock screen and the homescreen share the same picture...BOO! I liked my last phone where I could have my Bugs Bunny pic on my lock screen and a family picture on my home screen. I downloaded 1 ringtone from tracfone.com and 1 graphic. The first time I tried after activating my phone it said I needed to wait 24 hours. I tried again after about 18 hours and was able to download both at that time. Honestly if my husband would let me get a Smartphone I'd love one but for now it's Tracfone for us. And this phone works well for what I need it for. I can just annoy him with my text alert ringtone.

I give 5 stars to the phone reps who took care of the very complicated business of transferring everything over and back.]There was a time when you could call 411 on a Tracfone. They charged you a dollar or 2, they found the number, and they called it for you. Now--- you dial 411, and immediately get a long-winded voice ad. I'm paying them to sell me stuff??Anyhow...next, a recorded voice asks you what number you want. It does not matter how clearly you enunciate, or how close to a cell tower you are. (I was less than 1/2 mile away from one). Their voice recognition software does not recognize human voices. \"I'm sorry. I can't understand you\" is their response for every slow, distinct, pear-shaped tone I can utter.The first time this happened, I was freezing cold and soaking wet, standing out in a blizzard with a flat tire. The Gods smiled, and a good Samaritan with a real cellphone happened by to bail me out.The second time this happened, (today) I was trying to help someone else - trying to call the police for them. The term \"Police\" must be too difficult for the Tracfone software. So much for that false sense of security that I used to get from having a cell phone.Now to get to the phone itself. Using this phone is like handling an explosive device. Every time you move it - no matter where or how you hold it - the screen changes on you. Given how many different screens it has, this can get very confusing. It does have a tiny onboard keyboard for certain functions, but my small, woman's hands are a bit too big for it. I can zoom in and make the screen bigger, but that function is so buggy that it will just zoom up, zoom down, at will, without any input from me.I didn't pay much for this phone, and I was willing to bite the bullet and live with it. But what happened today was the clincher. Since I could not get the police phone # from 411, I tried to get it online. The browser window kept changing size all by itself. It was very cold and windy outside by the ocean, and you just can't see the screen in the daylight. Not really conducive to \"Browsing\" as we know it.But the real shock came when I gave up and tried to go OFF line, and stop the minute-eating-meter from ticking. I kept tapping \"Close Browser\" but it would not close. I was hammering it, but it would not close. It finally closed, after nearly 3 minutes of tapping. The same thing happened when I tried \"End call\" for the useless 411 feature, but that took over 5 minutes. The call simply would not end; the electronic woman just kept yammering on about how she did not understand me; I was ready to throw her and her whole outfit right into the water. I was finally able to just power off the phone. (When it happened again the next day, I actually had to pull the battery to make it stop.)After 5 minutes online and 7 minutes to 411, my balance was down by 50 minutes. Sort of like having a hole in your pocket, but you can't stop the leak.So I got home, went online and tried to transfer my number and minutes back to my old, trusty flip phone. But they have to send me a new Sim card for that. I really hope it gets here in time, since I only have 9 days to send the LG 840g back to Amazon.Maybe I got a lemon, but this phone is absolutely not ready for prime time.

Triple minutes, you can find the minutes cards almost anywhere and, if you can't, you can purchase minutes online at the Tracfone website.  Clear, vibrant, sharp display screen.  Quick response to icons.  Exception:  Surfing on this is abysmal due to browser given and performance but that's perfect as I don't want my son wasting minutes surfing.  Has a slot for a MicroSD card.  They give you a 2GB MicroSD card as a freebie but I'd pump it up to at least 32GB if you want to turn this into an MP3 player.  I transferred my son's old T-Mobile phone number to this phone on a Saturday and the process was fairly straightforward.  They (Tracfone) ask a lot of nosy questions - really.  My address I can understand if there was loss or theft of the phone.  My email address - I said \"no\".  They had the nerve to ask for the last 4 of my SSN.  I said no way.  Things proceeded anyway.  Phone number was transferred within 4 hours.  You just power off and power back on and there ya go.  When they prompt for \"activation\" it's kind of a misnomer.  What they really meant in my case was \"Add Airtime Minutes\" which I did.  A $39.95 200 minute card became 600 minutes due to the Triple minutes.  This is what I wanted as, while I liked T-Mobile it is very difficult to get enough \"talking\" minutes from them under $50.00 a month.  Yeah they (T-Mobile) and Walmart sell a lesser known (semi-hidden!) $30.00 per month service but it didn't meet our needs.  This is my speed.  If you don't use your minutes you have (I think) 90 days before they expire.  On my personal tracfone, I can get through an entire year by buying maybe 3, 120 minute cards ($29.95) that get tripled to 360 minutes.

I needed a phone for my aging Mother that would be quite easy to use and loud.  The LG 840G doesn't quite fits the bill.#1)  I thought it had a full keyboard.  It does, but only for when composing a text message!  You still have to use the tap 3-4 times to get the correct letter when entering contact information, for the notepad, and anything other than sending a text message.  Seems very silly that a full size keyboard is on the phone, but not accessible for everything.  This was a huge disappoint for me.#2)  The phone has 3 \"home screens\".  One is called \"Contacts\" but it is really \"Favorites\".  Again confusing when trying to set this up for someone not real familiar with cell phones.  Same for the \"Widget\" screen - would have preferred it to be called \"Home\".#3)  The phone is not nearly as loud as I'd hoped.  The ringer is adequate, but the call itself could be louder.  The call I made was clear on both ends.#4)  You get the most skimpy instructions and the on-line tutorial is not thorough at all.  But I was able to figure out everything.  Someone new to the phone may have more trouble or not use the web.#5)  A great thing was the size of the text, very large and bright!  But this causes most of a person's name to not be shown.  Wish they had used some word-wrapping here.  My Mom only has a few Contacts so this isn't a problem, but still not well thought out.#6)  A lot of features are useless and almost make the phone more confusing than it needs to be.  The widgets are quite useless except for the Notification Bar.  The Notification Bar widget is a very nice feature but could be better.  When I received a text a screen popped up that didn't seem to disappear until I tapped it - so there was no way to miss a text message anyways.  If you dismiss the text, it will show up in the Notification Bar along with # of missed calls and the \"!\" will turn orange if you have a voicemail.#7)  Most everything is quite straight forward and easy to use, except that darn keypad!  The camera is easy to use, sending a message is easy, setting an alarm is easy.  Folders is somewhat easy to navigate to files.  The Music Player isn't laid out as well and is more confusing.  Also, when marking someone as a Favorite, it uses the first phone # you entered in Contacts, so be careful when putting in your Contacts information - you don't get a choice.#8)  The screen is very sensitive and there is no setting to change that.  Like one reviewer said, I can see that when an incoming call comes in, it would be easy to accidently reject the call when you take the phone out of your pocket.  It also needs higher settings options to keep the screen on for a longer period of time.  For someone not quick they'll be tapping the on button and sliding the lock screen very, very often.I sent the phone off to my Mom along with my 7 pages of instructions, so we'll see how it goes.  It seems that that rather than than make a nice simple non-smartphone that it easy to use, LG cluttered this one up a bit.  I can't help thinking that if someone wanted a lot of features, they'd buy a smartphone.Regarding Tracfone itself - I'd give them 0 stars.  It was a nightmare dealing with them.  I cannot say enough bad things about them.  The convoluted way of transferring my Mom's service over to her new phone was insane.  I had to call her and have go through rather difficult steps to do it.  I was praying I wouldn't have to call Tracfone and use their horrible Customer Service.  They actually lied several times about sending me the phone and sent me a $10 phone to replace my $50 phone - really!  Getting this corrected took 2 months of phone calls and going through their horrendous phone system.  Really, really, really bad!  Had I not gotten the new phone this last attempt, I'd have just thrown the phone away and moved on as one really pissed off customer.I am a android smartphone user with Boostmobile.

Boy was I wrong!!!  First, it turned out that the phone had to be activated by putting in codes from numbers to be obtained over the regular telephone.  First I tried to get the numbers from the automated voice which was clear and understandable, but which paid absolutely no attention to what I was doing.  The keypad, which was not querty,  was too sensitive so I kept hitting the wrong numbers. I was not told how to correct the numbers so I gave up on the automation. The human voices came from the Philippines in broken English in a phone connection full of static.  Again i could not get any help but only told to start over and over again.  It happened that the slider did not unlock the screen as it was supposed to, yet the \"helpers\" just kept telling me to keep sliding.  Later I found I could unlock the screen by pressing the top button, so why didn't they say so?I should have mentioned that the phone came without a real manual and no manual was available online either.  Eventually I was able to activate the phone by writing down the numbers dictated by the automated voice and inputtting them afterwards.  When I tested the phone by calling it from my home phone, I found the sound was mediocre at best, very much inferior to the old Motorolla cell phone from ATT that I had intended to replace. By the way, when I originally purchased that Motorola phone, ATT activated it by a simple phone call, no coding nonsense.I ordered some airtime online which took three days to actually arrive on the phone.  Why so long?  On my current prepaid phone, new airtime is available immediately after I pay for it.My conclusion is that if you are skillful with smartphones, buy one that is top of the line.  If you are as awkward as I appear to be, stick to a simple phone that does not use a touch screen.  Here I had become rather discontented with my ATT Motorola phone, but now I see that things can be worse.

It's easy to text with and uses less minutes than calling voice usually.  I've never had a phone like this before but I haven't had any difficulty setting up wifi on two different routers or getting email to work. The browser experience is slow and not so great but on a screen this small, I wasn't expecting too much. It's nice to be able to track delivery on a package or such on the phone if necessary and it doesn't burn a lot of minutes to do so when I don't have wifi access.The screen is bright and text is easy to read.  The touch screen is pretty sensitive too, a little too much sometimes as I activate things without intending to with my clumsy fingers.  Holding a skinny phone is hard to do without touching something on the edge of the screen.2014-01-09 Update: On Dec 24, 2013 the power button died.  The phone wouldn't turn off or on.  I found a tip online to insert the charger and when the screen lights up with the LG logo, unplug the charger and alternately press the lighted screen buttons at the bottom of the face a few times, they will go dark when the screen shuts off. The phone reboots and stays on.  That's the only way I could turn it on so I left it on until my new phone arrived; charging it each night. I can light the screen with the volume button on the side, not turn it off though; have to wait for the screen to turn off automatically but can set the time as short as possible.I ordered another LG840g here at Amazon on Christmas Eve as for the price, there's just nothing better with Tracfone service. I'm contemplating buying a third as backup. I decided not to bother with warranty repair as paying to ship a cheap product with the possibility of receiving a used product in worse shape than my own, rather than my own phone repaired, isn't satisfactory to me.I still love the phone model.

Since then there have been some developments that I feel you need to know about. Before I purchased this phone,I made a call to customer service at tracfone and I was told that if I used the wifi feature that my phone would not be charged for minutes. Today, I hooked up the wifi and attempted to send some pics to my email addy. The pics would not go through, but the phone was charged several minutes for the attempts. Eventually I was forced to call customer service to get to the root of the problem, as the pics would not go through. I ended up having to phone the company three times before I reached a tec person who understood the problem and was able to correct it. The first time I called, while following the instructions of the customer service rep, my phone was charged for just over fourteen minutes. The customer service rep at first flat out refused to replace those minutes, or the forty minutes that were eaten while I was trying to get it to work as instructed by their booklet to begin with. Instead she offered me 10 min. and claimed it was company policy not to replace more than ten minutes ever.( this was proven to be the second lie I was told by a customer service rep) Eventually, after the third call to get this problem corrected, the gentleman who was speaking with my son, (by then I had taken myself out of the equation as I was understandably a screaming mimi by then, lol) apologized to my son for the fact that I had been lied to, and he also replaced all of the minutes I had been charged.He was also able to finally correct the problem I was experiencing. I appreciate the fact that this man owned the fact that the company spokesperson had lied to me to begin with. How ever, that never should have been an issue. I do not believe that she told me this lie because she was inexperienced, as I had requested a manager when I called. So I know she knew what she was saying. It seems that if you want to use the wifi to send pics for free, you must first log into your email carrier account, and then send the picture that way. (I haven't tried this yet, so I am still not sure if it will avoid being charged for sending the pictures in this manner, but the gentleman gave my son the impression that this would be the best way to do it.) If you send pics through the messaging option, you will be charged, and depending on the size of the attachment, it could be a very hefty fee, All in all, I am satisfied with the phone, but I must say that when it took 3 calls to get an honest person on the line, and when it takes 3 calls to get a problem addressed properly, well that doesn't reflect well on the technical help at all.The fact that I was lied to in my first contact with the company does not reflect well on them either. I do have to admit however, that despite the problems encountered today, I still am happy I purchased this model, and I am happy with the phone. Just beware of customer service, and make it clear to whomever you speak with, if you have to call, that you want ALL of your minutes back when they are through walking you through the problems encountered. I would make sure you get that promise up front before allowing them to blow through your minutes while they make mistake after mistake on your behalf. Technical support really left a bad taste in my mouth, but that having been said, I do like the phone.Merry Christmas everyone, and good luck with your purchase. (By the way, these problems should in no way reflect upon Amazon, they had nothing to do with the problems I encountered with the tracfone company spokespersons.)", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Happy", "Author": "Marilyn Clemens", "ReviewID": "R9ERCD9QN9DSM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Can't get it to activate and now they say have to have a new sim card in it.

The touchscreen is not as sensitive as a premium glass screen on a high dollar phone so it won't recognize many of your taps forcing you to tap more then once.2. The web browser is excruciatingly slow making it pretty much unusable. If you had thoughts of surfing the web while waiting in the checkout line at Walmart, forget about it. By the time it even finds your web site, you'll be reaching for your wallet to pay.3. The web browser forces you to enter text by using the number pad. The whole reason I bought this phone was because I hate using a number pad to enter text.4. The screen resolution is horrible. Yeah, you can check Facebook on this phone if you're willing to wait forever to get your feed. But when you do, the screen quality is worse than a childs toy. The pictures and text look pixellated and fuzzy. It makes you forget about using the phone to look at Facebook or Twitter.5. Checking mail is convoluted. I was excited about getting my e-mail on the go. However, to do it, you have to go through like three or four screen before it finally checks. And it is so slooooww[...] Plus, the text is so big and the screen so small that you can barely see anything on the screen without doing a lot of scrolling (which is bad because the screen doesn't always recognize your touch).What did I like about the phone? You can text using a full landscape keyboard. That is MUCH better than texting with a keypad. Call quality was ok.So, in short, you won't want to do anything with this phone other than make calls and text.  Forget about web browsing or Facebook.

Also, when I turn my phone on to unlock it to use, I have a very hard time of getting the screen to scroll up to open to use.  I also wish I could get it to stay on longer than 30 seconds.

Eight out of ten times when I turn it on, I get the message that the SIM card is not recognized; I have to turn it off and on again. I bought it because reviewers said it would allow the use of free wi-fi. Well, in my experience, it works sometimes. When I really need it, it won't work at all. The tracfone browser cannot handle a lot of websites and it closes with the message the site is too large. I downloaded Opera Mini and it stopped working for no known reason, I did not change anything/settings. Every URL I try to access on Opera Mini, I will get the Untrusted Midlet message and then it goes nowhere. It is so annoying that I want to smash the phone against the wall.Unfortunately, I need a better phone; I would not recommend this one. It makes good calls but I rarely call so it ends up being a fancy organizer with alarm and a 2 mega pixel camera. The truth is that I don't like this phone and I would not recommend it. I don't have the time to spend waiting for Tracfone customer support; I doubt they would be able to help me with the issues I am having.
