I haven't have any issues with my HTC One.  Battery life is staying steady since day one, and the phone is just as fast as it was when I first received it.  Very happy with the purchase thus far and hopefully will continue to be!EDIT (11/28/13): Another four months later, I'm still very happy with my purchase.  I haven't had a single problem with the phone, and it's just as fast as ever.  Seems fitting to post on Thanksgiving because I'm definitely thankful for such a great phone.EDIT (7/17/13): Two months later, I'm still in love with my HTC One.  The build quality is amazing and haven't got a scratch on it yet (no case but I'm very OCD when it comes to electronics).  BoomSound (could have perhaps picked a better name) still gives you the best sound quality out of any phone currently available.  My phone still has the same zip from day one.  Swiping screens, opening and closing apps, etc. still butter smooth.  The lag and jitters the Galaxy S4 sometimes experiences was a big turn off to me, which is why in terms of everyday use, the HTC One is much faster and more responsive.  If anyone has any questions, leave a comment and I'll definitely reply back.Original Review:It came down to the Galaxy S4 or the HTC One, and I'm definitely glad I went with the HTC One.  HTC truly outdid themselves with this phone, both in design and quality.  I'm coming from an iPhone 3GS, but even if you're coming from an iPhone 5 or a Galaxy S4, this phone is impressive.  I'm mainly comparing the HTC One against the iPhone 5 and the Galaxy S4, because I've had hands-on experience with both and also because I don't think any other phones even come close.Design:The HTC One not only looks amazing but has one of the best builds I've ever seen on a phone.  Its build quality is only rivaled by the iPhone 5 (I'd still say HTC wins).  It's not featherlight, but the slight heft you feel when you hold it only makes it that much better.  It's the perfect mix of premium quality, great design, and the intelligence to actually put it all together without screwing it up.  The Galaxy S4 in terms of build quality can't even compete.  Don't get me wrong, the Galaxy S4 feels solid in your hands, but the HTC One brings that experience to a whole new level.Screen:Simply stunning.  The HTC One currently has the highest pixel density of any phone with 468 ppi, followed by the Galaxy S4 with 441 ppi, and finally the iPhone 5 with 326 ppi.  I love the fact HTC went with an SLCD 3 display versus SAMOLED.  While SAMOLED displays offer truer blacks and usually better color saturation, this comes at the price of often times over saturating colors and not being as crisp and clear as an SLCD display.  Both the Galaxy S4 and the HTC One offer full HD 1080p displays, but I'd still go with the HTC One despite the slightly smaller screen.  Colors are simply more accurate and text is crisper, clearer, and easier to read whether indoors or outdoors.Hardware:The Galaxy S4 has a slight advantage on paper when it comes to processing power, but you'd never guess it by using the two phones.  The HTC One is actually a lot faster in everyday use.  I was amazed the Galaxy S4 still experienced lag and stutters when it came to simple things like switching screens or opening/closing apps.  While almost every benchmark you see gives the edge to Samsung, it really only proves that Samsung is better at... you guessed it: benchmarks.  In terms of raw processing power, the Galaxy S4 clearly wins, but in the real world benchmarks mean next to nothing, and HTC shows this pretty convincingly.  I'm not saying the Galaxy S4 doesn't have any edge because it does, but processing power alone is misleading.  In the words of another reviewer, \"In terms of performance, this phone is pure butter out of the box,\" and I couldn't put it any better myself.Camera:HTC shows you don't need a high megapixel count to experience amazing pictures.  I've never seen a camera take pictures as well in low light as the HTC One.  The detail and quality you get are ridiculous.  The Galaxy S4 is great in bright light, but if you're like me, most of your pictures are not in perfect lighting, which means the low light capabilities of the HTC One are much more valuable.  The Galaxy S4 also tends to over saturate colors, so while pictures may seem brighter, they're not true to color.  The colors and contrast on the HTC One are more accurate.  The HTC One is also quicker at taking pictures than the Galaxy S4.  If you're someone who spends a lot of time outdoors (in the sun) and wants a high level of the detail when zoomed in, the Galaxy S4 would work best.  If you're someone who spends most of their time inside or out at night, the HTC One would be a better fit.  I'd probably put the iPhone 5 somewhere between the Galaxy S4 and the HTC One.Sound:Beautiful.  The dual front speakers with built-in amps sound better than any phone I've ever heard.  There's really not much else to say.  The sound is crisp and clean even with the volume up.  Since the speakers are on the front rather than the back, the sound isn't muffled when it's lying down.  It also doesn't sound tinny like most phones.  Both the Galaxy S4 and the iPhone 5 have a single speaker and simply can't compete with the HTC One in terms of sound quality.Software:There's been some fuss over the HTC One being released with Android 4.1.2 instead of the latest version (4.2.2).  I couldn't care less for a few reasons.  First, there's not many differences between the two versions to begin with.  Second, HTC is probably holding out for the KLP update and simply skipping 4.2.2 altogether.  If you're someone who always needs the most up-to-date version, the Galaxy S4 is probably a better choice (ships with 4.2.2).  I have to give credit where credit is due, and Apple wins hands-down when it comes to update releases (not necessarily talking about quality).  All iPhones regardless of carrier receive updates at the same time.  Some argue Android has become too fragmented due to all the different versions currently running on phones and tablets, which in the end tends to hurt Android.HTC offers their UI called Sense while Samsung has their own called TouchWiz.  Here's where personal preference is going to come into play.  HTC's Sense 5 UI has been stripped down and takes a simple approach and design concept.  Samsung on the other hand has a lot more bells and whistles.  I'd say once again Apple is somewhere in the middle.  If you're someone who loves using a lot of apps and features, Samsung certainly has a lot more to offer in this area than HTC and Apple combined.  When it comes to what I'd call useful features, however, I think that comparison is much closer.  I like HTC's \"stripped down, no nonsense approach\" versus Samsung's \"throw everything at a wall and see what sticks.\"  If you're someone who likes to mess with things, the Galaxy S4 is more geared toward you.  If you're someone who enjoys simplicity, the HTC One is probably more your style.Battery/Memory:The Galaxy S4 has a larger battery than the HTC One but in real world testing performed about equal, so the extra 300 mAh doesn't give too much of an advantage (you could argue because of the Galaxy S4's larger screen but it's hard to say).  The main difference is the HTC One doesn't have a removable battery (much like iPhones) while the Galaxy S4 does (I've never been one to use multiple batteries, so it doesn't bother me).  There's another slight difference that usually goes unnoticed.  HTC chose to go with a Li-polymer battery versus the normal Li-ion (Galaxy S4 and iPhone 5).  Li-ion batteries suffer from \"aging\" or losing capacity even when not in use.  Li-polymer batteries, however, can hold a much better charge over time.The fact there's no microSD card slot on the HTC One might be a deal breaker for some, but I don't think it should be.  First, the HTC One starts out at 32 GB, which is double the Galaxy S4.  Second, the OS takes up less memory on the HTC One than on the Galaxy S4.  Roughly half of the 16 GB on the Galaxy S4 is reserved, which means you're already down to close to 8 GB before you download a single app.  It seems as if Samsung is literally forcing customers to buy a memory card, and worse yet, apps can't even be stored on them (only internal memory).  Out of the box, you either start with a little over 8 GB with the Galaxy S4 or close to 26 GB with the HTC One.  The HTC One is also currently about $40 less than the Galaxy S4 (AmazonWireless).  Apple wins again though when it comes to OS size with iOS taking less than 2 GB.The HTC One to me is the perfect blend of design, practicality, and power.  While it might not be perfect for everyone, I honestly think it's currently the best phone out there.  Perhaps the Galaxy Note 3 or the iPhone 6 will change this, but for now the HTC One is king (or rather the one :P).", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "The ONE to Rule Them All", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R2TVWV23K6SB5X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What is there to say about this phone? If I just write about it, I'm just going to ramble on and on. So to save everyone some grief, here are bullet points (my direct comparisons are to the iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note 2, but mainly to the Galaxy S4):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5 is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the Droid DNA/HTC Butterfly's screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 4.7\" 1080p(468ppi) form. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Why do most reviewers laud the iPhone 5's aluminum construction so much, when it chips and nicks so easily?? If you want a true masterpiece in design and craftsmanship, look no further. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other case). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication(*cough*Samsung*ahem*).3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick!5) For a near 5-incher, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 2. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance.6) The UI and software design is now very minimal and simplistic. For better or for worse, if you are used to the old Sense UI's, you will need some readjusting. Personally, I like this new one better. If you're a casual news reader, then you'll like new default home screen which displays a gathering of news sources - some of its own partners, some for your Facebook and Twitter, etc. - to form a Flipboard style of news reader. Personally, I'm a huge Pulse news reader fan, so I only use that.The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2300mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. Another bad thing that I've noticed is it charges slower than most other phones.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4, the One is lacking. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4's fancy functions. The S4's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light. The S4 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and MUCH better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S4 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S4 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones right now.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "HTC One - Back with a Bang!", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R2UGHYM59QZFWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is HTC on the verge a splashing comeback? HTC reminds me of Apple in mid 90s when they were struggling. People had ruled out HTC but they have come back with a bang! I upgraded one of my family phones to HTC One. I have a Galaxy Note 2, and recently used S4 for an extensive period. So at places I may compare with what I have experienced.HTC One build is excellent, smartphone design absolutely amazing, and a delight to hold. Aluminum is used for the backplate and sides, making it an all-aluminum body. It certainly feels better than Samsung phones in some areas. The ergonomics and looks of HTC One are stunning. The screen size is certainly smaller than Note 2 and even S4.4.7 in screen with a resolution of 1,920 by 1,080 pixels. Full HD 469 ppi (Corning Gorilla Glass 2, Gorilla Glass is the alkali-aluminosilicate sheet toughened glass manufactured by glassmaker Corning.  Version 2 of Glass was introduced in 2012). The phone is thin and light. I highly recommend you to try it at a nearby store. Reading reviews do no justice to the phone; once you experience it, you will drool. I am happy there is a stiff competition between phone vendors. I don't have attachment to any one vendor. I am open to trying all vendors.HTC One runs Jellybean Android 4.1.2, using HTC's Sense user interface, not sure if it will be upgradeable to version 5.0 \"Key Lime Pie\". We may see 4.2.2, or 4.3 version of JellyBean rumored for Google I/O in May 15-17 2013, just a week away as I write this review.Key Notes:* Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor running at 1.7GHz with 2GB of RAM* 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac support future proof for now. Note the support of \"ac\"* GPS, NFC, gyro, accelerometer, proximity, ambient lightAWESOME speakers. Per HTC, stereo speakers come with amplifiers, and Beats Audio technology for deeper bass. HTC one also has 2 microphones for reducing noise.* Camera is awesome; don't let the 4 MP fool you. It is the old photographer's adage. It is the not the megapixel, it's the sensor that matters! This camera is very light sensitive, and I was able to get great photos in low light situations.* micro-USB port for battery charging supports MHL, so if you buy an adapter you can use HDMI. Lot of people are not aware of MHL and not widely popularized. Basically you can make your smartphone into a giant computer. Connect smartphones to HDMI monitors or HDTVs, use Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and control smartphone. Per Wikipedia \"Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an industry standard for a mobile audio/video interface that allows consumers to connect mobile phones, tablets and other portable consumer electronics (CE) devices to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and audio receivers. The MHL standard supports up to 1080p/60 high-definition (HD) video and 7.1 surround sound audio while simultaneously charging the connected device.\"  DLNA Support is also included. These are awesome features indeed, and not noted much.* Just like the Samsung Galaxy feature, HTC One also works as an infrared sensor for controlling the consumer devicesSome cons:* 32 GB/64 GB models , but Lack of microSD card support may come as an issue for some* Battery cannot be removed (Li-Po 2300 mAh battery)* microSIM card is released by punching a paper clip. Just like iphones. As battery is not removable, this design is adopted by HTC* To Note: unlike international version, the Chinese models feature a removable back cover, featuring a Micro SD slot for storage expansion and dual SIM card slots. Dual SIMs are very popular in Asia not in US.* Crapware/Bloatware. Why do the phone manufacturers think they are adding value by adding software like Blinkfeed which cannot be removed. HTC advertises as a feature, I view it as a nuisance. There are no alternatives except vanilla Google Nexus phones. ASUS adds its own extra software, Samsung has its own. I feel they at least make provisions to remove these crapware.

However, this tiny, thin volume button is on the right side, forcing myself to hold the phone w/ my right hand instead of left.-No physical buttons to turn on the screen, resulting in only the power button to turn on the screen (S4 is a better design as it is located on the side for easier access).-The power button is flat on the top of the phone, causing inconvenience to find the button every time I turn on the screen. The button also get scratch up easily as it acts as an IR blaster. If they separate the IR and power button would be better.-The sense Home and Back button are not as consistent in sensing, which can cause frustrations at times.-Only two buttons on the bottom instead of three with an awkward design of Home button on the bottom right instead of the middle (This causes user to use the second hand to access Home instead of one hand due to the button either too far from the left thumb or too close to the right thumb)-The reception never gets full bar maybe due to the aluminum cover (my max is always 3/5 even on the streets)?-Takes a long time to fully charge (2 hours vs 30min. for iPhone 5)-Poor quality hand-free as recipient can't hear clearly unless I hold the mic up close to my mouth.*For personal preference: Although HTC One seems to be better than S4 in many aspect, S4 seems to be a better transition for iPhone users than HTC One.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Amazing", "Author": "J. Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"", "ReviewID": "R3SM6OZMESHVRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HTC One is one of the newest flagship Android phones to hit the market and aims to compete directly with the Galaxy S4. Like the S4, the HTC One offers a large 1080p screen, a fast quad-core processor, long battery life and more. However the HTC One does set itself apart from (and above) other phones in several significant ways. Overall, the HTC One is the most attractive and responsive phone on the market with an impressive screen, speakers and battery life.== Construction ==The HTC One has a remarkable look and feel that surpasses even the iPhone. The aluminum \"zero-gap\" housing conforms perfectly to the matte, white, plastic elements. The aluminum lends a sturdy feel and holds up well to fingerprints and really sets this phone apart from the plastic-dominated masses. Unfortunately, like the iPhone, the HTC One does not permit easy access to the battery. Also, the One is a bit heavier (5.1 oz vs. 4.6 oz) than the S4 and a bit thicker ( .36\" vs. .31\"), though the contoured back of the One makes it more comfortable in your hand.== Display ==The HTC One has a crisp, vibrant 1920 x 1080 LCD that offers the same resolution as a 1080p HDTV but in a 4.7\" screen. The pixels per inch come out to about 470 ppi, higher than the S4 (which has the same resolution but a 5\" diagonal) and much higher than the iPhone 5. In addition to its breathtaking resolution, the contrast is also much better than the S4 and most other phone displays. The HTC One screen offers very good blacks and extremely bright whites. This is one of the brightest displays I have seen and it functions very well outdoors. The color accuracy is also better than an AMOLED (like the S4), which tends to oversaturate colors, though many people like the punch of over-saturation.== Sound ==The HTC One is one of the few phones to make external speakers a major feature. The iPhone hides its single, external speaker on the bottom of the phone. In contrast, the One has two speakers located sensibly on either side of the display and (thankfully) facing toward you. Thanks to these dual speakers, you can actually enjoy videos in stereo without headphones or a peripheral device. The volume output is substantial and I found that only 50% volume was the perfect level most of the time vs. close to 100% with many other cell phones. Naturally, headphones will still sound much better and a 3.5mm port without obstruction makes it easy to use any pair.== Interface ==The software for the HTC One is fairly good. There is some bloatware that clutters your phone and saps battery life, but not enough to make me root the phone in disgust. The default screen seems inspired by Windows 8 and offers custom feeds in a tiled mosaic. It should work well for most users who want to check their phone frequently for news and updates from social media. Bypassing this screen will lead you to a generic Android icon list of apps. They are large enough and spread out enough to make things easy to find and you can sort them a variety of ways, including most recently used. The included apps will get you off the ground running and many are good enough not to need replacing. By using your gmail account you can sign into a number of google services at once to make everything operate cohesively. The best part of the interface is how responsive it is. The touchscreen works perfectly and the hardware is fast enough to keep up with multiple demanding tasks at once. The software keyboard feels a little cramped despite the size of the screen and I don't like how you have to switch between numbers and letters. The keyboard does respond well though with very few typos.== Camera & Calling ==Although I hardly use my phone for calling people, naturally, I found the HTC One provides great clarity using the speakerphone or earpiece and the dual microphones work well at eliminating background noise. I have been using Ting for service with this HTC One without issue. The camera is an oddball at 4 \"ultra\" megapixels. The S4 has 13 MP and most high-end phones offer 8MP. The difference is minimal when viewing un-cropped photos, but zooming in or cropping can make the HTC One's camera turn out noticeably less detailed photos. However, the \"ultra\" pixels are no gimmick. The HTC One is capable of using a lower ISO setting than other cell phone cameras while achieving the same (or better) exposure. While this doesn't work so well on moving objects, the HTC One excels at low-light and bright-light photographing of still scenes. If you are able to frame your pictures such that they don't require excessive zooming or cropping, then the HTC One camera should do a great job, though not quite up to the S4. Also the HTC One offers image stabilization for those (everyone) who rarely use a tripod.== Miscellaneous ==The HTC One has a 2300 mAh battery vs. 2600 mAh for S4, but exceeds the S4's battery life according to several professional reviews. In my own experience, the HTC One has more than enough juice to last me a whole day, any day. The HTC One also has a power button doubles as an infrared port and using the included TV app, you can easily control pretty much any home theater. Setup with my Samsung TV, Denon Receiver and Motorola (Verizon) Set Top Box took all of 3 minutes and was very straightforward. I still prefer my Logitech Harmony 900, but always having a remote on hand for any room in my house is certainly handy. Finally, I do worry about damaging the HTC One more than my wife's iPhone. I am a little apprehensive about denting or scratching the aluminum, but I hate cases (except for my wife's iPhone which loses reception otherwise).

My wife's iPhone 4 recently died and instead of upgrading hers, I switched my iPhone 5 to her account and upgraded mine to the HTC One. I'm REALLY glad I did. This phone is brilliant. Not only is it one of the most beautiful devices I've ever seen, but it does all of the things my iPhone wouldn't do. I found myself super frustrated with all of the things iOS can't do. The things it does, it (generally) does well, but why do I have to do/have everything the way Apple says I should? The things I ended up being frustrated about with the iPhone are the very same reasons my wife likes it. She's not a tweaker...she just wants it to work and not have to think about it. So Apple says, \"This is how you do it\" and she does it. For me, I say, \"Why do I have to do it that way? Why can't I do it *this* way?\" And with Android, I can. I can set it up however I want (and I have).OK, all of that said, the phone itself is just brilliant. It's super fast and responsive, and so far there are very few drawbacks (most of which have to do with Android rather than the phone itself). The biggest issue is that actual call volume is fairly low. The speakers are amazing, but when on a call, I find myself wanting to turn the volume up a bit. Not unusable by any means, but literally the only negative I can think of about this phone.The screen is beautiful. I wasn't sure about the larger size, especially coming from the iPhone. Apple seems obsessed with one-handed phone usage. This screen is too big to use one-handed, but it's so nice having the extra space. Overall, a wash in that regard.Much has been made of the camera. I don't use phone cameras that much, so I haven't paid much attention to it. It seems to take decent enough pictures, especially in low light, but they definitely don't compare, pixel-wise, to other cameras. As soon as you start zooming in, the HTC's images start to get a bit pixelated. Not a big issue for me at all.Overall, this phone is absolutely brilliant and I'm really glad I switched from the iPhone.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Arguably the best Android phone", "Author": "Jason A. Kentros \"SharkByte\"", "ReviewID": "R1OI20YSSL6T2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd Android phone, coming from the LG Optimus G and the Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket before that.  Both were good phones, the Optimus my favorite of the two, but I experienced some frustration with the software update process and some buggy issues with the Optimus as a result.  I wanted to have a phone that will receive top priority for future updates, and the HTC is among the most popular of all flagship Android devices, for good reason.Here's a breakdown of what I feel makes this phone stand out from the rest...1. BUILDThe solid aluminum body gives this phone a premium, high-end feel superior to most of the other Android phones out there, mostly encased in plastic.  The Optimus did feel more solid than the Galaxy series, and many others I've looked at, but nothing in comparison to the HTC One.  The  HTC and Optimus have the same 4.7\"-size screen but a slimmer bezel makes the HTC One fit in the hand just a little more comfortably.  All around, this feels like the most premium Android phone and closest possible competitor to the iPhone in the build quality category.  In making the phone as sleek as possible, HTC chose to tuck in the power and volume rocker buttons very flush with the body.  To some, this could be an annoyance as I've read that some cases make it very difficult to access those buttons, just a little warning.  Regarding the choice between Silver/Black (or other colors depending on where you purchase from), I've read that black shows wear and scratches more than Silver if no case is used.  I really don't think any phone should be left unprotected (especially considering the massive variety of cases for this phone) because accidents can happen and even the most well-built phones will not fare well if dropped even a short distance over a hard surface.2. SCREENAs mentioned, this is a 4.7\" screen.  It is full HD and has higher pixel density than any other device available right now (including Apple), and the display is STUNNING.  The text is flawless and images are sharp and detailed with realistic colors, not oversaturated as Samsung and LG tend to be.  The screen sits beneath Gorilla Glass 2, which may give you some peace of mind if dropped, but I use the same argument as above regarding protection.  Screen protectors are not expensive, and for this phone are very easy to install (simple rectangle); make a simple investment to keep this amazing screen flawless.3. SOUNDHTC advertises its \"BoomSound\" powered by Beats Audio and it is very impressive, even down to the slightest details like notifications and ringtones.  The front-facing speakers make a big difference in giving you a more immersive experience while playing games or watching video, and the added boost translates even when using earphones (as can be tested by turning Beats Audio off/on while playing any media).In those 3 categories, I really don't think there is a better phone out there, at least until the HTC One Max is released and mostly that will just be the \"big brother\" to the current model.---------CAMERA-This is an \"ultrapixel\" camera, not the typical megapixel standard used by others.I have not taken a lot of pics yet, but I can see that it does well in low light conditions and the pics I have taken look sharp.  From what I've read and heard, the camera is not the strongest feature on this phone, despite impressive editing features and the Zoe software that is part of Sense but I've yet to see any shortcomings.BATTERY LIFE-The bulk of my usage is tied to music/apps followed by texts, then calls, and so far I can get through the day just fine.  I have made a few tweaks to help it along though, such as conserving CPU power in the Power Saving mode which is always on, and turning off animations (in Developer Options/Advanced).  Neither setting will cause any noticeable lag in performance.SPECS -Honestly, only when doing benchmark tests will you see much difference between the high end Android devices (same for Apple vs. Android), so boasting about CPU/RAM is pointless.  The HTC One is incredibly fast, but to the naked eye not vastly superior to comparable devices with similar specs.  Once you get past the specs and build, all that's left is the main thing that sets Android and Apple apart, the OS.HTC uses the Sense UI to optimize the experience for their users, much like all Android phone manufacturers.  Samsung uses TouchWiz and LG has the Optimus UI to add their own flavor to Android.  Sense's most polarizing feature is Blinkfeed, a Flipboard-style homepage that incorporates news/weather and social media in one place for quick viewing.  It cannot be fully disabled until Sense 5.5 update is released, but can be bypassed by setting another screen as the home screen if you want a more \"stock\" look.In conclusion, this phone really seems to bring the very best Android has to offer across all features/specs.  Love the way it feels, looks, sounds, love the processing power.  It's already got the latest version of Android available now and it is RUMORED to see KitKat 4.4 before the year is over (on or around Christmas) so if you want a phone that is well made and will be future-proof, look no further!NOTE:For those who are coming from an Android device with the 3 touch-sensitive buttons and miss the \"menu\" button, fear not as you can change the behavior of the home button in settings (with 4.2 update or higher) to long-press for menu.  The product details state that the Android version is 4.2 but the one I have came out of the box with 4.1.2 so you would need to install the latest update (4.3) in order to change that setting.If you love the hardware, but just can't stand the Sense UI, you could always buy the Google Play Edition straight from Google which just has stock Android loaded on it, or root the phone and install the ROM yourself.  Keep in mind that rooting your phone will void the warranty and you will not receive the over the air (OTA) updates as issued by Android, you will need to install them yourself.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Android Phone On The Market Hands Down!!!!", "Author": "Nicholas R Acho", "ReviewID": "R347YRNO86P60J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best Android Phone On The Market Hands Down!!!! Worth every penny great buy. Makes Iphone 5 cry itself to sleep.

I'm someone that always likes to jump on board with the latest and greatest and so I tried out the HTC One shortly after it came out. Despite my initial excitement and some positive aspects to the device and the software, I ultimately ended up returning it. I've tried to highlight the pros and cons below that led to my decision.Pros- Fantastic build quality: This is what an Android phone should be built like and it just feels fantastic to the touch. High quality materials all around - save for a few bands of plastic for the cellular and Wifi radios. Holding this in 1 hand and the SGS4 in the other makes it readily apparent which company went the extra mile to build something that feels solid in the hand. I feel like the black version in particular has a sort of soft-touch finish that makes it feel just a bit nicer to hold in the hand, and with some more grip to it as well.- Excellent screen: The color reproduction is by far the more accurate out of the recent crop of android devices on the market. I regularly use a color-calibration device on my computer monitors, so I pay particular attention to this. The unit I specifically got has a slight red-shift, but nothing that impairs the overall quality. It's definitely got more accurate color reproduction than the Samsung Galaxy S4, but some people might like the \"richer\" more saturated look that the SGS4 provides. Viewing angles are only about okay, but not a big issue for me since I'm the only one that uses this. The 1080p Resolution makes everything crisp and easy to read.- Above-average low-light performance: This phone overall does a better job than most other competitors in terms of low-light performance. I wish I could say it stands above the rest, but Nokia takes top honors in low-light and in terms of mixed lighting scenarios I still think the SGS4 is still a step up. See the cons for more information.- Good camera software: The Zoes feature is pretty cool and is a great way to create little clips or pick out the best image of the lot. It's easy to share and integrates well with existing social networks. It's one of the unique software features HTC offers, and is definitely one of the fun highlights that most people I show really enjoy playing with. I just wish it came with a dedicated camera button to make taking pictures a bit easier.- Great built-in speakers: The speakers that are built into the phone sound pretty solid if you're holding the phone in the standard portrait mode. It's great for sharing something with a friend when you're in a more public area and most phone speakers give out. Don't expect miracles from phone speakers, but as far as phone speakers go they are a step above the rest. The beats software also does some great synthesizer work when you plug in your headphones, though it's more suitable for current pop and hip-hop music than for other genres.- Blinkfeed: Blinkfeed sort of integrates all of the news you care about into one convenient sliding panel. I tried it for a bit, and while it's convenient I also feel it was reducing my battery performance (no evidence of this), so I simply chose to ignore it. It's a great option for those of you that want to pull in information from all of your favorite sites into one area. I don't think there is a way to remove blinkfeed entirely, you can only choose to ignore it like I did. Still work trying out though!- Includes IR integration: This means the HTC can connect and control your TV, which is pretty handy when you can't find the remote. It's pretty basic in terms of the controls you get, but it works well in a pinch.- Solid wifi performance: I have a Asus AC-1750 802.11ac router and tested speeds on file transfers and media playback with the HTC One and it came through with flying colors. I was easily able to transfer a 1080p MKV movie file of around a few gigs in size in minute or 2. It's not as quick as the external 802.11ac adapters I have, but excellent for a phone.Cons- The metal build of this phone means that if it gets dropped it will definitely show some serious battle-scars, paint chipping, and dents. The SGS4, though plastic, does have durability going for it. It's a shame to feel like you have to invest in a case since it's such a good looking device, but I just don't feel safe about using this phone outside without one because it's so easy for someone to bump you accidentally and for this phone to get thrashed. The metal also means this thing heats up quite a bit when you're doing things like watching movies/tv or playing a game.FOR THE BLACK VERSION: Please note that when the black version picks up small scratches and dings, which it does pretty easily I'd say, it is very noticeable because they appear a bright silver against the black finish of this phone. So buyer beware, that while the black version looks fantastic, you're risking a phone that picks up and shows scruffs very easily.- Camera is just not that great overall: The camera integrates what HTC is calling ultra-pixels, which are basically a smaller number of bigger pixels to capture more light. While this is a fine solution to capture more light and give you better low-light performance, it's not the best choice for when you do have plenty of light or even moderate light. Frankly, I just didn't think the images were that great, and the lack of zoom while working with them on your desktop becomes readily apparent - especially if you like to crop your shots after taking them like I do. I personally think Nokia's implementation of using a ridiculously large megapixel sensor and combining multiple pixels to oversample is the better solution. Take a look at the new Nokia 1020 sample images and compare to see for yourself. If I had to buy a Android phone today and wanted the best overall camera - my nod goes to the SGS4.- Average battery life: While the capacity seems decent for a phone, because of the higher resolution and larger screen I've been seeing very average to poor battery life results. I've used it mainly on my daily commute, which involves listening to Pandora to and from work, checking gmail very regularly throughout the day, and using the calendar and GPS functions frequently. I do watch a tv show during the afternoon sometimes if I'm on the go, and make about a hour or 2 worth of phone calls a day. Put simply, I've bought a external battery pack and a spare charger with me everyday that I had this phone because if I wanted to go out after work I could not trust the HTC One to make it through. Every HTC device I've tried has had middling battery life, from the HTC Sensation to the HTC One X. It seems HTC hasn't changed much here, and it's a shame because the battery is sealed in, so I'm not at all confident about battery degradation over time.- No expandable storage: The 32gb that's built into this phone, with a fair amount used up for the HTC software, just isn't enough for power users. I load on a good deal of my own music and I used to just swap out movies and tv shows onto a microSD card slot to take on the go (thanks to data caps ruining the fun of streaming them on the go). I think 32gb will be fine for most people, but not having the option to expand like the SGS4 or Sony models just puts HTC one step below.- Still some lag: This phone has some really fast internals, and does indeed run very smoothly most of the time. Unfortunately, there are still those moments of slow-down and lag that have plagued Android handsets for a while that I at least still notice. This isn't going to be a 100% smooth experience, but it's not enough to severely impact the daily use of this phone. Just wanted to mention that it still is there for those of you that care.- Poor button placement: The power button is along the top part of the phone because it's integrated with the IR blaster, meaning it can be pretty hard to reach for those with smaller hands. Moreover, HTC decided to break the Android standard and include only the back and home button with a big non-functional htc logo in the middle. I can't tell you how many times I've pushed the logo expecting to go home, and this is something my friends have done too when playing with the phone. It's just a poor design decision.Ultimately for me the most important aspects of a phone are camera performance, screen quality, and battery life. In terms of camera-performance the HTC One is just not as good as the competition, and I cannot recommend buying it for the ultra-pixel (4MP) camera when there are better options available today and coming out soon. Screen quality on this phone is probably the best you can get in nearly all regards. And the battery-life is just something that on day-1 isn't good enough for me on what I consider moderate usage. Overall, if I had to own this phone for a few years, I wouldn't feel too happy about it. While the screen quality will hold up over time, the camera performance is already behind the competition and the battery life will only get worse as the battery degrades over time. I'm glad HTC is staging a comeback and this is a great first-step, but it's still got some work to do before I can recommend their devices for long-term ownership and satisfaction.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone for everyday use", "Author": "hanawababe", "ReviewID": "R2ED9KOQJPBATS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because of the overwhelmingly good reviews from almost every website.

Selected this one for the awesome speakers and camera that seem to be unmatched by the competition.Forward facing loud stereo speakers just make sense.  Why would you want one tinny speaker facing backwards or hiding inside?And I'd rather have fewer pixels that capture more light: the ultrapixel camera does a great job indoors, without a flash.  I'd rather not consume 12-40MP to store each picture; 4MP is plenty since the quality is higher.  These pictures look great on a big screen TV.Then the Zoe features are icing on the cake!  I've used this extensively in just the first couple weeks.  In the space that the megapixel cameras would store just a few pictures, Zoe captures 20 pictures and 3 seconds of video.  This enables the amazing automated event highlights that are much better than slide shows.  If you hit the shutter too late, chances are what you meant to capture was captured in the 5 frames before you hit the button; just back up and there it is.  I sometimes slide through the Zoes to find the best picture of 20.  I've used the overlay feature in action shots to merge multiple pictures into one.  And I've used the slow motion video capture with variable speed playback.  Very happy with the Ultrapixel camera and Zoe.The FHD display is beautiful.  Blinkfeed is a nice home screen but you can easily change it out if you like.  Calls sound great.  The whole interface is well done.  The solid aluminum construction is great.There's nothing I don't like about this phone but I might be biased since it's my first.

But...", "Author": "Odubb31220", "ReviewID": "R3V32KE6GQUMCQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, I am very impressed with the HTC One.  It's a beautifully designed phone which operates quickly and smoothly.  I ordered mine in Stealth Black and it's holding up extremely well.  Honestly, my only issue is its battery life, which I'd rate 3 out of 5 stars.  I'd get at least two more real-world hours from my iPhone 4.  By no means a deal breaker for me...I just wish I could be a bit less dependent on a charger.  Apps load and operate very fast and I have yet to experience any issues with overall usability...quite stable thus far.  Also, when I am able to pull an LTE signal in my town, network speeds are very, very fast.  3G and HSPA+ performance are very good too.I'm platform agnostic and run many an operating system (Windows, Mac OSX, Ubuntu, iOS, Android), simply because I like to mess with different tech.  My main reason to switch from an iPhone 4 was to get another Android-based phone in my stable; and with an iPad and two iPhones in the house I was yearning for something other than iOS.  A couple years back I had a Motorola Atrix 4G (Android 2.2), which I tried really hard to like (I really liked the finger print reader!!!!).  But constant hardware issues prompted me to switch to an iPhone 4.  Since then I've been waiting patiently for a high-end Android-based phone once I became upgrade-eligible.  I was split between the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One.  From my experience they both gave the same experience.  Decided to get the HTC One over the Samsung Galaxy S4 since it was aesthetically more pleasing.  Personally, I feel its 4.7 inch screen is a good balance of size and ease of handling with one hand, not to mention it is very sharp and, compared to my iPhone 4, is much easier to see in bright lighting.Additionally, most of the non-Apple apps I use are readily available on Google Play.  I personally don't buy into iOS having all the good apps...so I encourage you NOT to drink that Kool-Aid.  BlinkFeed is just okay...I'd rather use Flipboard or Pulse reader.  It's held back by a limited source of feeds.  If a wider range of feeds were available it'd be quite nice.  That said, I do use it occasionally...but it's not my \"go-to\" news reader.  The camera takes great photos (Zoe feature is pretty slick) and the quality of the speakers is excellent.  I'm a bit hard of hearing in one ear, so it's nice to have a quality speaker phone option.  The included ear buds are, surprisingly, not too bad and can produce some fairly high SPLs with a a tiny bit of strain.  They aren't audiophile-flat...to my ears the top-end is a little rolled-off, but that may be due to an influence of some bloated bass.If battery life is a big deal for you I'd look elsewhere, but if you can get past that shortfall I'd definitely recommend it due to its overall speed and solid software performance.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lots of AT&T; bloatware...", "Author": "Samuel H Thompson", "ReviewID": "RUIGRZGZA2HOP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very quick and snappy, given its hardware specs, but the AT&T; bloatware is annoying to look at.

Gimmicky name but they are really good, much better than any Galaxy phone. I use the speakerphone whenever I can instead of holding the phone up to my ear, and I don't like using bluetooth. They are loud enough that I can't use them at max volume. Music sounds great but the volume is limited by the quality of music you listen to.2. Build quality. To each his own.

All email is set to not sync, Facebook does auto sync though. And I use an app called Juice Defender in the Play store.Things I don't like.1. Sense: I will agree that it is better than Samsung's TouchWiz skin though. The dialer is straight up fugly.

I was certain I'd be going for a Galaxy S4, but after reading numerous reviews and testing phones head-to-head in store, I went with the HTC One.  It was a great choice.  The aesthetics of this phone have been praised in nearly every review, and I must say it's deserving.  But there's a lot more to like, including:- Speediest performance I've experienced in any smartphone.  Faster than Samsung and either tied or slightly better than the iPhone.- Excellent camera with lots of customization options.  The built-in filters are great.- Great sound, from both the front speakers and also the tangle-free headphones (included with the AT&T; version, not sure about others)- Great screen resolution.  I don't watch movies on my smartphone, but I'm nonetheless impressed with the picture quality.- Surprisingly good battery life!  It's not eternal like the Droid Razr MAXX, but it seems as good as anything short of that.  (And it's a much better overall phone than the Droid.)  Particularly impressive given how slim the phone is.- Call quality is only so-so.  This could be the phone, this could be AT&T.;  It's decent but not abundantly clear.  But the reality of my own particular situation is that calling has become secondary to internet/email and texting as far as smartphone communication goes.  If you spend hours each day talking on the phone, you may want to shop around.  This could be one of the best phones for calling or it could be one of the worst.  I really wouldn't know.  I will remark, though, that call quality across all phones/carriers hasn't improved nearly as much as internet speed and connectivity has.In terms of the service, I switched from Sprint to AT&T; when I bought this phone.  It costs me an extra $10/month and I no longer get unlimited data, but I believe it's worth it.  AT&T;'s overall coverage is just better, period.  They also have pretty much uniform 4G coverage wherever you go, whereas Sprint is still besotted with sluggish 3G in most locations.  Also text message delivery is speedier with AT&T.;  You'd think there would be no difference, but there is.  I'm finding AT&T; is the sweet spot between Verizon (great service, but simply too expensive) and Sprint (somewhat cheaper but frustrating service).

The big downside to this is that the black color is NOT anodized aluminum(some sources say paint, some say dye, others say it's anodized), leaving any scuffs with aluminum protruding through highlighting the fact the phone has received a scratch.  This differs from the black iPhone as when that scuffed, the \"inside\" color would still be dark and not stick out like a sore thumb.  HTC instead chose to paint the phone black instead of having the color be throughout the phone.  They need to have a better coating on the phone to protect the finish.Get the aluminum for the longevity.

I've tried looking for solutions or people having similar problems, but haven't found anything helpful yet. My best bet is that the lag is caused by my hard drive being at capacity (with mostly music), but that's just my guess. Also, i highly advise getting a case for it, because my exterior is now chipped up heavily, and the sticker with my bar code and phone info on the back is almost completely faded /rubbed off. I don't use my phone excessively; this is just from normal use. One plus: I had the misfortune of dropping my phone in the toilet, and it was completely submerged for about 2 seconds (just water, thankfully). After submerging the phone in a bag of uncooked white rice for 24 Hours, it turned on, and has worked fine ever since (this happened several months ago). I know what you're thinking, but the lagging issue was happening well before the drop.To elaborate on the lagging: I will be typing and the phone will freeze up for a couple of seconds. This happens almost every time I use the keyboard. Also, when I wake my phone and slide from page to page of my apps, it will freeze up for a second or two. This, too, happens frequently. Same goes for when playing music and using any apps, particularly Maps. Besides all that, the phone is great! Lol.

The juggernauts of the smartphone world are devouring the market share and HTC is feeling the crunch. It's a shame really, because this is the best phone HTC has produced in a decade. The HTC One is great. I've had several HTC phones over the years including some of the missteps that have kept them out of the top spot amongst Android phones. But this ONE is the best one. The casing feels elegant and sturdy. The design is simple and sleek. The sound? The sound is incredible. The quality of the front facing stereo speakers is better than most laptops. Beats Audio is put to good use here. The screen is bright and crisp and the animation transitions are smooth and snappy. The cameras are not the best in the biz, but are by NO means flawed or underwhelming, but it would be a mistake to compare it to the outstanding camera of the Galaxy S4. The camera has good clarity in low light but does not handle colors particularly well in those instances (which can be fixed afterward with an image editor.)The home screen app, Blink Feed, is pretty cool. I wasn't sure that I would like it at first, but it has grown on me. It allows you to set up different newsfeeds and social networking \"at a glance\" features. The weather widget is the standard HTC AccuWeather powered app that other HTC devices utilize. It is very nice and often imitated.Battery life is pretty good under normal use. I would prefer that phone manufacturers return to a design that would allow for easy battery replacement, but that is a minor point.This phone is not upgradable in storage either. There is no SD slot which I would also appreciate. Still, the 32gb (~25 usable) on board is  sufficient.PROS: Beautiful design and form factor. Top notch response and screen.

Also feels sturdy considering its flatness and thinness+ The camera is awesome! Produces very clear pictures+ Tons of customizable options+ Love the notifications! You can customize what you'd like to be notified of and they'll all appear in a list that you access by swiping down from the top of the screen. Settings can also be accessed this way+ 1080p screen is simply stunning+ The speakers are very crisp for a phone, and I'm very happy that they face the front+ The music app is wonderful and easy to use. Luckily it has a different and far more functional bar that houses tabs (genres, artists, etc) than the annoying swipe bar used in the phone app, as detailed below. Switching between Now Playing and the list of songs/genres/artists is a sinchCons+ There's no button on the front of the phone to unlock it. Only power button, located on the left of the top side, will unlock the phone. It's a bit annoying for a right handed person+ Some buttons are difficult to press accurately and I frequently miss them, even though I have small fingertips: the always-present back button on the bottom of the phone, the back button in the internet browsers, the exit/close buttons on certain apps (for instance, when I press the button to view multiple tabs open....I accurately press the close button 25% of the time)+ Even being fairly tech-savvy, it required a good bit of research on how to customize the phone the way I like it, and still am not entirely happy with what I've got+ A ridiculous amount of apps come standard with the phone, but they cannot be deleted. I don't use even half of them. They all go into one group labeled \"Don't Use\"+ The \"phone\" app that you use to make calls on is really frustrating.

I decided it was time to check out the 1080p 5 inch phone with juggernaut specs. It has an all aluminum/metal casing with an IR blaster, 4 Ultra pixel rear camera (which just means it is a 4MP camera that lets in more light) and dual front-facing Beats Audio speakers. It\u2019s innovative, different and just an eye-pleaser. However, the inside is a problem. The Android OS is faster more than ever, but there are still huge issues, including random freezing, added skins by manufacturers, overly complicated menus and hard to find features. The new Kit Kat 4.4 OS is supposed to make the look simpler, but the problem is if you have an HTC, you have to wait until the manufacture or your cell phone provider decides to provide the update. It would be nice if it was a uniform release because I was still running on Android 4.2 and was not even given the option to upgrade to 4.3. Additionally, a big issue was the IR blaster/lock/power button that was very flush/sunk in; it is hard to reach and hard to press with your finger. I would consistently have to use the tip of my finger or finger nail to press the button, additionally, since it was so sunk in, I would have to look for the button to make sure I\u2019m actually pressing it. The 4 MP camera provided decent pictures outside but inside it produced grainy, almost distorted pictures. It\u2019s a great concept to have better megapixels instead of more but I think HTC compromised by not providing enough of the pixels, if it was a combination of more and better, you\u2019d have yourself the best camera in the market.Now the positives: It has amazing dual stereo front-facing speakers, which after listening to them you wonder why other cell-phones don\u2019t have this convenient features that just makes sense. It\u2019s not on the side or back so you can listen to it without having to worry about muffled sound and the Beats Audio boost actually provides a noticeable difference. The phone also has a great 1080p bright screen that\u2019s great to watch and stream videos. The extra viewing space was a treat after transferring from a 3.5 in. iPhone screen, it was especially apparent when using apps like twitter and Facebook and browsing many websites. Finally, the phone feels great, all aluminum casing means it\u2019s cool to the touch and will stand out. It actually makes you never want to place a cover on it.In closing, the HTC One is One of the best feeling and looking phone I\u2019ve ever held but unfortunately because of a hard to use and reach lock button and the software it does not provide superior functionality.

The screen, performance, design, and minimal Android overlay checked all the boxes for me, and after several months of owning it I'm glad to say that I've never been more satisfied.Pros:- beautiful screen- highest quality design/sturdy premium feel- blazing performance- fast, good quality camera- all the benefits of Android and GoogleCons:- short battery life due to components it's powering- recessed power button difficult to press without adjusting hand position- HTC logo where a home button should be, although relatively easy to adjust- Sense 5 is great, but some superfluous features and slow upgrade processAlthough the list of pros and cons are similar in length, the latter three bullets are easy to overcome with practice. The first con is universal among high-end smartphones, except the Droid Maxx.If you're in the market for a well-built, high performing product, then look no further. The range of high-end devices are high and an equal argument can be made for anyone of them, but the One provides the best of all worlds and any shortcomings can be adjusted with apps in the play store and some change in smartphone habits.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it.

Those have been discussed to death in other reviews (both on Amazon and gadgets sites around the internet). What I can tell you though is that this phone is a great, high quality phone. HTC really went all out with this device and it shows. The body, the screen, and even the camera are all as good as promised. If you're debating between this and the Galaxy S4, make sure you stop in an AT&T; store and hold both models in your hand. For me, the HTC One *felt* better in my hands. You my find the opposite to be true.If you're worried that the camera is \"only\" 4 megapixels, don't be. This camera takes decent pictures in most environments, including darker areas. That was important to me. I didn't want a phone that took just good photos in well lit areas, but one that took them inside, where lighting wasn't always perfect. This camera delivered on that. But that's something that's important to me. If you're going to take a lot of well lit photos, you may want to go with a different phone. This one takes good pictures in many kinds of circumstances, as opposed to being good in just one area.This is a top of the line Android phone and for this year your choices are this or the Galaxy S4.

If you have read all the reviews on Amazon, you should have known all the pros. I'm writing to inform potential buyers to be aware of some issues that HTC One has. First of all, the unit I have has slight gap between the top and bottom cover. How big is the gap? Mine is noticeable. Google \"HTC ONE gap issue\" and you will find this is a pretty common problem. I hope HTC has came up with a solution to this. I'm sending my unit back for an exchange.Typing on the keyboard is more difficult than on iPhone (that was what I have been using for the past few years).Also, the HTC One is very slow on charging. My iphone 4S charges very quickly (I would say from 0-60% in an hour) and HTC One only reaches 25%-35% in an hour. This is another common complaints on forum which some said it has to do with its new Li-polymer battery; slower charging will prolong the battery life which is important because it is not replaceable like the Samsung S4. Even with all these cons, I still insist on an exchange of the phone instead of returning it. The design of this phone is marvelous. To me it is the best looking phone right now.

Industry reporting indicates 44 percent of Android users are still using versions 2.3.3 through 2.3.7 - known as Gingerbread - which were released in 2011 and have a number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions. The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date.\"The bulletin proceeded to identify SMS Trojans, rootkits and fake Google Play domains as security threats and offered various mitigation strategies.For example, to fight against SMS Trojans it advised, \"Install an Android security suite designed to combat these threats. These security suites can be purchased or downloaded free from the Internet.\"To protect against fake domains, \"Install only approved applications and follow IT department procedures to update devices' OS. Users should install and regularly update antivirus software for Android devices to detect and remove any malicious applications.\"The IT industry and tech-savvy users have known about these types of security concerns - stemming from Android fragmentation, most mobile phone manufacturers' sloth and indifference, and user inertia and ignorance - for a while now.
