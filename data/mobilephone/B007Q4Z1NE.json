{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just about the only way you'll get real Google Android on VZW", "Author": "Richard Allen", "ReviewID": "R23SJDST5WWSZB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is, and has been for more than a year, one of the finest phones on Verizon Wireless in my opinion. I really prefer the open nature and usability of pure AOSP Android OS with full Google Services and that's what Nexus devices are known for. The Verizon and Sprint editions of this phone are plagued with a few issues such as only passable battery endurance, and updates that require carrier approval which means a rather lengthy testing period before release putting it months behind sibling unlocked GSM edition, but if your savvy it truly is a piece of cake to unlock the bootloader, install a custom recovery and flash a ready built up to current source code built rom from somewhere like the excellent XDA-Forums without issue. If your even more savvy its fully possible to install the Android SDK on your Windows or Ubuntu PC and roll your own build from the very latest source code from Google's Android Open Source Project repositories. You cant really say that about many Android devices outside of the Nexus family, and this device is completely worthy of the name.Lets talk about specs. The Galaxy Nexus has a 4.65\" 1280x720 Super AMOLED-HD display with pentile subpixel arrangement. To my eyes, the display density and color depth hide the usual issues of a pentile arrangement quite well and I quite enjoy the rich inky blacks and vibrant (if un-natural) colors of an AMOLED style display as opposed to LCD (although HTC and LG have managed to create some stunning LCDs lately). The Galaxy Nexus is powered by a dual core OMAP 4460 SOC at 1.2 ghz with 1 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal NAND storage, and a qualcom radio chipset that in this variant is capable of CDMA 1x, EVDO rA, and LTE c13. In my personal usage I have seen LTE download speeds in excess of 30 Mbps and EVDO at a solid average of 1 Mbps. The GPU is the now standard fare SGX540 which is capable of playing some higher end games at decent framerates, but without the jaw dropping special effects you would see in software optimized for Tegra based hardware. In other words, it competently gets the job done and does it well, but its not going to make your jaw drop and it was really never intended to in the first place. Call quality is what I would consider average. Noise cancellation works quite well and both parties can hear and speak clearly, but the earpiece volume could be louder, as could the speaker around back when using speakerphone or music.Build quality is what one should expect from a Samsung built device. The body shell is composed of strong but flexible plastics, and the screen glass is scratch resistant, but lacks the rigidity of the Corning Gorilla Glass you would see in a Motorola or HTC device. Overall I would rate it quite good for impact resilience and overall durability, but after riding a few months in your pocket you can expect it to have a few random scratches and some fading in the gloss around the spine. Battery life is merely OK when you are not in an LTE coverage area or have LTE disabled. When you use LTE (4G in laymans) you'll suck down battery like a kid on a juice box. Luckily this phone continues Samsung's tradition of removable batteries and they are very reasonably priced. There are also numerous options to choose from for extended life batteries, so battery life is not as big an issue with this phone as many people make it out to be.Overall I give this phone four out of five stars because it really is that great, and if you can nab it for $200 or less in decent shape and manage to keep your unlimited data plan intact with VZW the way I did (without a subsidized upgrade), I would totally recommend it. Its strong, beautiful, and because it is clean android without all the clutter, everything runs great. It truly is the reference platform for Android apps and even a full generation later it performs admirably.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT NEW", "Author": "PJ911", "ReviewID": "R813T6JQX2Y4A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this phone from Pure Mobility to replace my broken Galaxy Nexus. Amazon search for \"New\" galaxy Nexus led me here. Phone was received and activated and after only 4 days, the phone stopped working on 4g. Verizon tech was unable to fix this even after a factory restore. My SID card was tested in shop and was fine, so the phone was bad. Return was authorized and I returned. Email to Pure mobility asking if they had a NEW Unused one for exchange instead of return and was told \"Sorry, we do not\" even though their storefront shows them still having MANY for sale as NEW.NOTE: Verizon queried the serial number of phone and found it had been previously activated last year 2 times !

WIFI speeds are Very fast. Easy connect to Open or WPA AES Access Points.Screen quality is about as good as it gets barring some HUGE screen that may arrive later or something with a denser pixel count.This is likely the most versatile phone on the market right now.CONS:Sometimes battery life is lower than expected.4G to 3G connection transition sometimes leaves you with no internet. (to fix, hit airplane mode on, then off. All set in a few moments)WIFI secured with the old WPA PSK may have an issue connecting if there are multiple Access Points (like in an office or school).Conclusion:Overall Very nice will get 5 Stars once the few issues I see are resolved.The upcoming update to Android 4.0.4 for Verizon should fix the few issues i have.(VZW holding it back for some reason?)", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "R38DZPP3LHHQP3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Despite being a year old, this phone still races through anything I can throw at it.

As an Android/Google power user I need a \"pure\" Google experience phone which seamlessly integrates the host of Google apps I use on a daily basis - Drive, Gmail, Books, Music, etc. Since I am also a Verizon loyalist, this phone made the most sense after my OG Droid (love that phone too) was finally laid to rest.If you are vested in the Google ecosystem, I recommend this phone. But beware! It has a number of issues which may be deal killers for some: bad camera, frustratingly quiet in-phone speaker and horrific battery life. If you are going to purchase this phone take heed - you will need an extended battery, a car charger or Juice Defender to manage power usage.Of course, the biggest impediment for many Galaxy Nexus owners is Verizon - they will slow the update process. At the writing of this, Android 4.2.1 has rolled out to other \"pure\" Google experience devices such as the Nexus 4 and Nexus 7. Verizon will slow the update of your Galaxy Nexus by rigorously testing causing two to three month delays. Caveat Emptor if you need updates right away.In short, this is an excellent phone for purists of Google. For everyday users, I highly recommend the HTC One X or the Samasung Galaxy III.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R35X3XAMICSIA9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best phone I have ever owned.

Lyk \"Edjeu Lyk\"", "ReviewID": "R3B6715HV03217", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I guess I should have done my homework better.  First when receiving this I tried to activate it on-line just to discover I needed a SIM card from Verizon.  I went to the local Verizon store and they gave me one for free and activated it for me, but it took an hour in the store. The Droid 3 this replaced had 3 bars in my apartment, this phone has none. I was hoping for the better 4G speeds but have yet to ever see 4G appear and yes, I live in a major city with Verizon 4G.  Next is the battery life. I charged the battery to 100% and with using no internet usage nor even one phone call it was dead (well, 10%) in 6 hours.  Yes, in my pocket from 100% to 10% in 6 hours. I is a cool phone, it upgraded over the air to Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2 as soon as it connected to WiFi. Unfortunately to use it for something other than Solitaire I need to stand on the roof of the parking garage with it plugged into the car. I just ordered an extended battery, hopefully that will correct at least one issue.UPDATEI just want to be clear I have no problem with the seller Oakland Wireless. They did a great job, the phone arrived quickly, is in excellent physical condition, it looks new. It was packaged very nicely. I highly recommended them to anyone looking for a used phone and will likely use them again myself.

So I was looking for a powerful phone for this network. I wanted stock android without the annoying extra software from both the network and the manufacturer, as these software usually runs on the background using your battery and RAM memory. That brings me to my last criteria, at least one gigabyte of memory.This phone fits the bill. I got an used one because my 2 year contract is in the middle of it, so I have to buy full retail price.  So far so good. I should say, this is the best android phone I have ever had. I want to upgrade, but I don't think any of the new phones both android and IOS have enough new tech to justified any of them at full retail price.

The phone is fast, beautiful and runs android jelly bean.In simple I like: - The screen is bright, clear and a good size. - The phone is big, but not overly large. Fits in my jeans nicely - The phone has almost all the bells and whistles - NFC, 4g, Nexus tag (up to date software), bluetooth ect... - Fast. this thing runs everything I want quickly, smoothly and without problemsI don't like: - Outdated - this is no gs3, nexus 4 or note2 - I have had battery problems (see below) - Battery could be better, I need to charge during work most days.Now to my battery problems. I have had to replace the phone and the battery on two occasions because the battery decided to no longer charge. The first time the phone wouldn't realize I had unplugged it and I was forced to pull the battery to reset this issue. If I did not pull the battery it would die very fast. The second time the battery would not charge. Both times I was able to get replacements hassle free. My new setup has worked for several months without issue.In all I love this phone.

There are newer phones, and there are better phones.  The radios on this thing aren't the best, but I keep my unlimited data and 99% of the time it's just a nice, smooth phone with a great screen and adequate internals.I run it with a Hyperion extended battery and a Seidio Convert case.  The hyperion WILL fit in the case if you scrape a little of the felt lining out.Keep in mind the reason that these phones are so readily available is that they shipped them new with a TINY battery and everyone returned or sold them.  With that battery you might not make it until lunch.  You HAVE to run the extended.Run it with:http://www.amazon.com/Hyperion-Extended-Compatible-SCH-i515-CAPABILITIES/dp/B007C8XRJY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1398914910&sr;=8-1&keywords;=hyperion+galaxy+nexusYour phone is going to eat one of these batteries about every four months, but they get replaced for free by Hyperion's amazing customer service team.  The battery will get really hot and then stop holding charge.  Before then, it will give you all day power if you're using it smartly.http://www.amazon.com/Seidio-BD4-HKR4SSGNL-CONVERT-Holster-Samsung/dp/B006ZGB4FI/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid;=1398915075&sr;=8-6&keywords;=seidio+galaxy+nexusI was a little concerned about ordering a case from a company I'd never heard of, but this thing is a beast.  Otterbox quality.  Tough and excellent, and fits the extended battery like a glove.Finally, you want to run it with one of the Cyanogenmod 11 preview builds.  They're really stable, so don't worry about them not being totally done.  The thing that makes the 11 build so much more desirable than the 10.x buillds is that it's based on android 4.4 kitkat, which was designed to use RAM much better on phones that don't have a lot.Like this phone, which has less than 1GB.  New superphones have double or triple that.I was about to get rid of my nexus before 11 came out.  It was buttery smooth after I installed it.  READ UP on the process before you do it.  It's fairly simple but you could have a $200 paperweight if you rush in and don't do your research.So, there you are.  These components and setup will get you a beastly, hotrodded, modern phone for less than $300.

It's certainly not a new phone, and isn't the fastest thing out there, but unless you're part of the small minority that plays extensive 3D games on your android device, this phone will have plenty of power to run your applications.  32 GB's of storage is more than enough to store media, no expandable storage, but again not many people will use more than 32 Gigs, especially considering Google has a great music streaming app.  The phone is thin, and has a slightly curved glass screen.  Functionality of the curve is not existent, but it is neat to look at.  The battery is only 1850 mAh,  which will drain faster than you can count to 10, so expect to buy an extended battery, or at least a spare.  Battery life is, and has always been, this phone's undoing.  The other complaint people have about this phone is the slow update cycle.  While other Nexus devices are running Android 4.3, this one is running Android 4.2.2.  Not missing out on much, but expect to be sideloading a custom rom if you NEED the newest firmware, VZW takes forever to approve updates.OVERALL, this phone is a great phone, and is the only way to get a Stock Android experience on Verizon.  It's missing Google Wallet (Easy to get working with some changes to the build.prop file), doesn't update as quickly as other Nexuses on other carriers, and has pretty bad battery life with the stock battery, but these are the things that caused Verizon to stop selling this phone in the first place, and in turn, are why this phone is so cheap.  I've always seemed this phone as a compromise.  You sacrifice some of the things that really make the Nexus brand special (Updates and freedom), to instead be on the \"Nation's Most Reliable 4GLTE Network.\" It's not perfect, but it's the only phone I'll use.

I received a response within 6 hours and the seller informed me that I can get one for free at the verizon store (which I did).. The phone came as advertised (perfect condition, like new), and 4 days earlier than the estimated delivery date.Now onto the phone. Just as a quick background, this is my second smartphone. My first was the iphone 4,which I loved. My only issue was the size of the screen. I have pretty poor vision, so it was hard for me to to read mobile apps on it, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a smart phone. I'm was one year away from my 2 year update, so I decided to search for a used phone with a larger screen. My research led me to the galaxy nexus and it's 4.65 hd screen. This suited my needs much better. I will say one thng, do yourself a favor and buy yourself an extended battery or an extra battery. Having read at least 100 reviews I found 1 common denominator= the poor battery life. knowing this before hand was beneficial, as when I ordered my phone I also ordered a hyperion extended battery and case. It does look a little silly to make such a big phone even bigger, but believe me, it's worth it. I got a full day and a half out of it, which is better than my iphone. The phone is an absolute monster. I would say it blows away my iphone 4 in just about every category. It's ridiculously fast and the display is beautiful. Coming from the retina display to an amoled screen takes some getting used to. The colors on the samsung amoled are absolutely stunning, if not over saturated at times, and blacks are incredibly black, much more so than the iphone. The iphone has the more realistic colors, but blacks are greyish and the colors aren't as vibrant.

In my opinion it is nothing in comparison to the droid.  It feels flimsy and cheap., like i could break it between my fingers.  thats a large negative for me because i am not always very gentle with my phones.  Another neusance about it is that mine ccame with a broken battery cover (seller's fault, not samsung)  The keyboards on the screen are too tiny and the battery life is nowhere near the droids.  Another huge downside is that there's no memory expansion slot.  then on the phone itself theres that google search bar on the top of my home sreen i just cant get rid of! overall i guess if your on a tight budget like me this will get the job done...but i probably wont be buying a samsung phone again", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "VERY DISAPPOINTED.", "Author": "Joseph Francis Dellaquila", "ReviewID": "R3E8NN6CE4V11Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Where do I start? Perhaps the fact that the battery only lasts 4-6 hours on my phone- I have to charge it 3 times a DAY- Unbelievable. This is why I cannot wait to be eligible for my upgrade so I can get an iphone like I used to have. I would not recommend this phone, nor would I recommend buying a used one from anyone on Amazon- I'll probably have to buy a new battery for my phone soon and I only had it for 3.5 weeks.

The replacement phone had the exact same problem however.  It seems like this seller has a bad batch of Nexus phones. They claim that it is my SIM card which does not make sense because the same sim card works in my old phone and three SIM cards from Verizon never worked.
