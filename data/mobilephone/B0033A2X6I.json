The phone is fine, and it looks great, and functions well.But there were some issues...... The box said White. I got a black phone, which was OK, because it is in a case and the color cannot be seen anyway. The phone said it was unlocked. I wanted that, and not a jail-broken phone. The phone is indeed locked, and cannot be used on any other network besides AT&T.; If I switch carriers, I must apply to unlock it myself, or jail break it myself. This is what I wanted to avoid. It was not clear that the phone was refurbished. In fact, I would categorize it as misleading in that the word was never used in the ENTIRE ad, and should have been. Given the price that I paid (over $400), I was well under the impression that I was indeed getting a new phone. Anyplace else I looked at had them to $100 less. I think that the seller misuses unlocked when it should be clear that this phone would have been jail-broken.All in all, I got a nice working phone, but I think that this seller is misleading and dishonest in dealings.BUYER BEWARE!!", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "What is this?", "Author": "Meeshka", "ReviewID": "RA6BMOLR201A2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I charged the iPhone 3gs for two hours.

Golde", "ReviewID": "R33067E9JHIOLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased an iPhone 3G when my Samsung Galaxy died with 6 months left on my T-mobile contract. I wanted an iPhone and I didn't want a new contract. Besides, T-Mobile doesn't offer the iPhone (why has this gone on so long) but you can use unlocked iPhones with T-Mobile because they are a GSM provider.I got the phone at a good price and it was shipped and received quickly. The iPhone was new and in the factory package as promised, in absolutely perfect condition. I needed some answers off the internet to get the SIM card installed (never owned an iPhone) but that was simple. The phone worked immediately.Two problems. First, the 3G is definitly out of date. It runs iOS4 and can not be upgraded to iOS5. The problem is, most apps you download today need iOS5. If you have had a 3G a while, you downloaded the older versions of the apps and they run fine. Since I just bought this, I have to find old versions of the apps to have them work on this phone. THis is a pain, however a function of my buying an out of date phone, no reflection on the seller.The second problem was worse. I didn't know, but iPhone users mostly do, the 3G will not charge with the provided equipment if the battery runs out all the way. This was really upsetting. I called the seller and left a message. He called back within hours, explained this was a known problem with these phones, and if I had an iPad, that charger was more robust and would charge the phone. Sure enough, that worked. Now I know not to let it go to 0 and if it does, use the better charger that comes with iPads.I really appreciate the personal service from the owner of Better Deals Faster, Kyle, and getting to know iPhones without spending $750 ( a new iPhone 5 without a contract).", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not factory unlocked.

I bought the I Phone 3G this spring & right away it had charging issues. I put it away as I intended to return it & had another phone I was using at the time, but since my other phone had a smaller screen that I don't prefer to view emails on, after a few weeks, I decided to give the I Phone another shot. It wouldn't take a charge from the wall charger, but would charge directly plugged into my computer. Then that didn't work after a very short while, so I purchased a portable charger box that works for several older phones, & that seemed to work sometimes ..other times no. I got tired of this since use of the phone has been unreliable from the beginning & I just figured it needed a new battery. I took it to Apple & had the phone verified as an authentic I Phone. They told me it is from 2008. I had the battery replaced which I was told wasn't dead btw... & also had the phone charger port checked while they were in it looking around for the possible cause of the problem. The port is fine. No defects & nothing disconnected. The phone charged when it felt like it wanted to after doing all of this & has been no different than before, but for the last two days it simply won't charge at all! It doesn't even chime when you plug & unplug the chargers or turn green. The screen shows it's plugged in for a second without making any noise then goes black. It shows a thin red bar that should change to green when it's on the charger, but nothing happens. I don't know what the deal is with these older I Phones, but I don't want to pay to try and find out any more as I feel I have done all I can. It's been a few months since I got it & I regret not returning it right away. ... The reason I don't recommend this seller is because the phone did this from the beginning when I got it, but I was certain I could get it to work as I've had older phones of other makes for years.. (global sim card capable/ unblocked phoned don't come too cheap is why I kept them phones for years). They always worked. If the battery life was gone, I would just buy new batteries, so I never would have anticipated that the phone just wouldn't work from the beginning!Hope this helps.. if your phones don't take a charge from the beginning, don't make the mistake I did. ..RETURN THEM IMMEDIATELY!!!", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Jailbroken", "Author": "Rachael", "ReviewID": "R1MOUGT7U9KPI1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As many others have said, this is a jailbroken phone, rather than simply being unlocked.
