In fact, for my phone line never served. I wanted to return, but will not give further details. The Seller was another drama ....I recommend, especially if they are outside the U.S. and want a good sized product that offers fast, do not buy this phone!", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "slow data connection", "Author": "Ta W.
