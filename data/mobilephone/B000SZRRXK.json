{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Another winner from Palm!!!", "Author": "Ivan Alfredo", "ReviewID": "R2YP4QOKMJR6OT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I decided to buy a smartphone I seriously considered buying the Treo 650 since many reviews written at the time the 680 was launched mentioned a poor battery life for the Treo 680, and an apparent lack of improvements over the previous model. Most reviews were written before the camera patch came out which solved the battery drain problem, so, here's a review from a longtime Palm user who got his first Treo. The Palm website includes a page where you can check if your device needs to have the camera patch installed (you need the Treo's serial number).This is a great combination of a high tech phone and a Palm PDA. It has all the functions I was used to on my previous Palm-powered devices. I have owned a Palm Vx, a Clie PEG-615T, and a CLIE-PEG TJ25, and lately a Palm Tungsten E2. The only thing I really miss is the grafitti (handwritten) function. The keyboard is a little cramped for my taste, but I assume I will become used to it. Apart from that, I just love this phone. The battery life is adequate, since I used to charge my handheld daily, charging the Treo's battery daily is no big deal for me. The device's stability is also great. So far I have not had any trouble with the Treo blacking out or restarting on its own. This device is great for people on the go, and I still believe it is far superior to any blackberry device and Iphone, since a Palm-powered device is a handheld computer and not only a fancy cell phone. The Treo 680 is easy to use and very intuitive. I comes packed with useful applications, and there thousands of applications you can buy and install customizing the phone to your personal needs. The documents to go application is great to take with you spreadsheets, powerpoint presentations, and word documents. The pocket tunes software is great for listening to your favorite music (with a SD card, not included), and the amount of RAM (64MB) is just great for taking all the applications and games that you need on the go. The only thing I wish it had is wi-fi capabilities, which it doesn't. It is great to finally take along only one device instead of two (PDA and phone)!!!", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Rocks!", "Author": "B.

I've used several smartphones in the past, both Windows Mobile 6 as well as Palm based.  I keep coming back to Palm because of its ease of use and stability.I love the keyboard on the Treo 680 as well.  I can fire off emails very quickly, and the keyboard is quite spacious.One thing I like most about the Treo that no other cellphone or smartphone offers is the threaded chat feature.  Your Treo keeps all incoming and outgoing texts in a chat-style layout, so you know exactly who said what, and when.  Very cool!", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Product Is 5 Stars But I Need To Make A Point.", "Author": "An Ikearat's Brain \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R11LPDIQQ0543", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First let me say that Unlocked Cell Phone Kings has done very well for me. I like these guys.That having been said let me draw a little bit of attention to a very minor detail.The \"new\" (Silver) Palm Treo 680 I just received from Unlocked Cell Phone Kings is branded with AT&T;'s logo and has AT&T; software in it. This is no problem, but I was buying this phone to get an unbranded, International Version. I wanted both the non-logoed casing and the ROM -without- the AT&T; \"junk\" in it.Still, the phone they sent is a really nice unit and I can and will use it.The only other issue I have is that they sent a power supply with an HTC brand on it. A \"new\" Palm Treo is never equipped with HTC branded products. Also, that fancy HTC power supply got lose in the packaging and put a big nick in the side of my nice \"new\" Palm Treo 680.Again, let me say I'm not unhappy here, i just want to know in the future I can depend on Unlocked Cell Phone Kings to deliver what they are selling. They price amazingly well and no one can beat their delivery speed!Contact me and we can talk about the 3 star thing. There seems to be no way to get ahold of you guys without making a telephone call.Update: Returned the phone. It was not unlocked, did not recognize my T-Mobile SIM card. Wanted to send email to the seller but no address, not even on their company web page. Did not try calling them. I liked the phone and would have used it even with the AT&T; stuff but the not-unlocked twisted the knife as they say.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "about my treo 680", "Author": "Eric Kwame Adjei \"nanakofi\"", "ReviewID": "R2MM650W0GUWAY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the palm treo 680 is one of the best pda smart phone i have ever used.the only problem is the battery.its a superb smart phone.i am happy to have it.", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Palm Treo 680", "Author": "Cliff", "ReviewID": "RVQMD49W9NGQF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good phone from Palm.

Even worse, the battery drains completely overnight. I'll fully recharge the telehpone, unplug it, and leave it off overnight. In the morning the battery is completely dead - the phone won't respond at all. I'm very disappointed in generally poor battery performance, and especially disappointed in the complete drain of battery power overnight while the device is turned off. Palm needs to come up with a solution or design a better GSM smarthpone.", "Date": "November 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Can't read SIM card", "Author": "Unhappy Customer", "ReviewID": "R27WSDY72VXOBT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone came faster than originally stated, which was the only positive I can say. I placed my SIM card in and the phone wouldn't register it. This is a SIM card I've put into other unlocked phones without any problems, but this phone failed on multiple attempts reinserting the SIM card and never registered the SIM card at all. The phone was a complete waste of money. It never worked, even briefly.
