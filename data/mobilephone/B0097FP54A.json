{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Highly recommended (for Virgin Mobile users)", "Author": "Brandon", "ReviewID": "RM4H6MN1HZQBI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to get this phone at an amazing price just after Thanksgiving -- however, I feel that, even at the regular retail price, it is a great buy. Compared with all of your options for phones from Virgin Mobile, this is probably the best choice for 98% (or more) of users. I made the switch from a LG Optimus Slider, and I'm loving (almost) every minute of it!This phone is slim and lightweight, but still with a bit of substance to it -- so you can still notice you're holding onto something -- it just won't weight you (or your pockets) down. I put my Samsung Galaxy Reverb into a made-to-fit \"rubberized\" case (while I purchased the case elsewhere, I'm sure the ones being sold on amazon are identical). The case is (surprisingly) really not that \"rubberized\" of a texture, it's just not slick like polished plastic. I like uniform flatness the case gives to the backside of the phone, and I especially like the rim ('round the edge) it provides on the front side.Anyway, on with the phone... Yes, the screen is not the biggest available -- it is precisely 4\" when measured diagonally. There are some other phones with larger screens, but screen size is not everything. Four inches is a pretty good enough size for me (especially when upgrading from the Optimus Slider's 3.2\" screen), and it should be sufficient for the vast majority of users out there. Any bigger and you start getting to the point of asking yourself, \"Is this supposed to be a cell phone or a tablet?\" Besides, the screen, with its high resolution and brightness, is beautiful -- and incredibly touch responsive.While the screen is made using Gorilla Glass (many sites do not note this fact, but I've come across resources that confirm it), it still feels like glass. Be it however strong and crack resistant, there actually IS a way to make it so your fingers slide across the screen with absolutely NO effort. In my hunt for a good quality screen protector, I came across two that use an application process that does NOT use static (like most cheap screen protectors), as well as that are cut to fit the screen exactly (rather than have a cut-out section, with corners, for around the earpiece and camera areas). They are from Skinomi and IQ Shield -- both true \"screen shields\" rather than just \"screen protectors.\" Being that reviews for Skinomi screen protectors (for other model phones) tended to be less-than-stellar, I chose IQ Shield. IQ Shield LIQuidSkin - Samsung Galaxy Reverb Screen Protector Ultra Smooth Film + Lifetime Replacement Warranty Pair this screen shield with the Galaxy Reverb and you won't be disappointed.Android 4.0 ICS is really easy to use and to get used to. There are many more customization and settings options compared with previous versions of the OS. I like how they did away with the \"search\" button at the very bottom -- it looks just a little cleaner. I'm not really sure how to describe the rest of the OS, so I'll just say, \"Try it, and I'm certain you will like it!\"I haven't heard anyone else mention this, but when I first was setting up my phone, it immediately started downloading something called Mobile ID. I'm pretty sure this is Virgin Mobile's new version of their own proprietary app package. Right after installing (which also was automatic) it changed a few things, including the home screen and the icon layout. I did not like this and was irritated. I tried to find the app by name and uninstall it, but to no avail. So, since I'd yet to add anything personal to the phone, I did a Factory Data Reset. But that just took me around in a circle, leading back to having the Mobile ID package load back onto the phone. After a minute of playing around, however, I was able to get things back to the way I wanted them (still, though, without being able to uninstall the Mobile ID package). I just wish it were mentioned somewhere (especially on the Virgin Mobile website) so that I wasn't left confused and perplexed.The specs do mention that this phone only has a single core, rather than dual-core (or more) like the higher-end phones. But to me it seems very fast, fluid, and quite capable. I'm sure this phone will handle almost anything most users are going to throw at it. The only problem I've run into so far is that I sometimes have to tap the screen more than once to get it to register my command. I'm not sure if this is a hardware or a software issue, and I'm also not sure if this little problem is unique to me and my phone (since I haven't heard of others mentioning it). Anyway, it's really not something to give a big complaint about. I'm especially hesitant to detract from the features and usefulness of this phone, given it's many highlights.I've yet to play around with either of the cameras, so I cannot comment on that. Wi-fi works great, as expected. I was pleased to be able to set it up using the WPS feature -- super easy! I was hoping that this phone would make a big leap in signal strength compared with my previous phone. There is a bit of a stronger connection, but nothing incredible. My house, as well as my sister's, is just in a precise location where the cell towers don't reach very well. Messages are never missed. However, voice calls can be difficult to connect to at times, and data connections, even 3G, are usually painfully slow. I don't find it as much of a fault of the phone, though -- just crappy network locations. Anywhere away from the house, especially on the road, is just fine. The GPS is quite intuitive, by the way. You practically may not even require an individual GPS unit, depending on your needs.After experiencing the ever-so-popular lack of battery life with my previous Android phone, I was very relieved to find that this phone's battery lasts for quite a sufficient amount of time (still, obviously, nowhere near the \"rated\" battery life --- I'd like to know who came up with those ratings). I'd been so used to having to recharge my phone EVERY night, many times before the day was over, that I'd given up on thinking there were phones that existed with much better battery life. Even before I installed the Juice Defender app (highly recommended for getting the most out of your battery) it was noticeable how well this phone's battery preformed. Now I can go two full days (of light phone usage) without connecting the charger and the battery hasn't been completely depleted yet. By the way, I especially love, and find quite useful, the optional feature of the percentage indicator (located next to the battery icon). Do take into account, however, that I'm not a heavy user, and everyone is bound to have different results. I just thought this all was worth mentioning.So, everything taken into account, I'm extremely pleased with my purchase of the Samsung Galaxy Reverb. While not quite top-of-the-line, but definitely miles above bottom-of-the-line, it's quite a feature-rich, affordable phone, especially when paired with the Virgin Mobile service. You can go ahead and do all the research you want (which I encourage) but I'm sure you'll be pleased if you decide to land with this phone.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Definite Upgrade", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1MDM4OWJUHB12", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll start by saying that I upgraded to this phone from an LG Optimus V from Virgin Mobile.With the recently reduced price point on this phone, it became an increasingly attractive option. This is a great phone for the price. The phone is lighter, thinner, and has a larger, more beautiful screen that has rich and vibrant color. The processor, while only a single core, is very responsive. Setup was a breeze. I've also been able to enjoy a number of apps due to the large internal memory, which is upgradeable through an SD card and also because of the more recent operating system, Android 4.0.4 (or Ice Cream Sandwich). I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone that is looking for an affordable upper-mid range phone. Especially if you don't utilize your smartphone to talk a great deal, as the $35 plan comes with a 300 minute allotment (Which is plenty for me. I only talk about 3-4 hours maximum in a month).As this is still the honeymoon phase (I've had the phone for less than 24 hours at this point), I'll keep an eye out for any problems or issues and revise this review if necessary.Edit:I have now had this phone for a few months and it is still a great phone. The only issue I've run into was a part of an OTA update from Virgin Mobile that caused the keyboard to become very slow to load, which could cause some issues when trying to browse the web. Going into the Google Play app and downloading another keyboard app made this a non-issue. Otherwise, I stand by the previous comments. This is a great upper-mid range phone that comes with a \"plan\" that is hard to beat.Edit #2:After another OTA update, the phone is now running Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) instead of the 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) which is what is advertised. That is certainly an upgrade in my opinion, as Google Now is a wonderful addition to me. However, for those that are not interested in Jelly Bean, you've been warned.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Upgrade from Samsung Intercept as well", "Author": "VectorJoe \"Regular Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3PJ7CMP68LRSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, like at least one other person here, I upgraded from a Samsung Intercept.  (Note:  if you were running an early generation Android on VM-USA and had the $25 plan, your upgrade means you can't keep the $25 plan and need to go to $35 plan minimum.  Wish it was otherwise, but not too big of a deal.)So in terms of performance (after 1 day) it is much faster.  The screen is easier to read.  Battery so far seems to be much better as well.The one negative I've noticed so far and others have noted as well, is that it is a bit slick.  I got a generic case/holster to protect it, but I might actually go with some grip tape in some strategic spots for holding the phone.Anyway, I really like it so far.  I'm still getting it set up.  Great deal for $99 on CyberMonday.I'll update this review if I find anything that would change my mind.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "UPGRADE", "Author": "Quenisha", "ReviewID": "R108IGPGV4F7EC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got it in the mail today and it's already light years ahead of my old phone. I previously had the LG Optimus V. At the time I thought it was a good phone but after a while it got laggy and a I wanted a newer model of Android. I researched for WEEKS about which phone to get from Virgin Mobile and settled on this. After receiving it I am BEYOND pleased. I'll do an update later on in the week to let you guys know how it's going. But as of right now, in this very moment, I am VERY MUCH in LOVE with this phone.UPDATE: I've had this phone for about 2 weeks now so I feel that I can give it a proper review now.The phone is a comfy size for texting. I've got rather small hands and if feels just like when I type on my iPod touch. The keyboard that it comes with is absolutely DREADFUL. When I'd read reviews on it and people said that I just thought that they were exaggerating but no it's the truth. They would all recommend Swift Key. It's a paid app so I was skeptical, I don't like buying apps. I had the trial for a 3 days-week I believe (I don't remember the exact dates). That keyboard is beyond amazing. It's customizable so you can change the back ground and the settings and you can add another language. It's great. Definitely worth the 3.99. However, if you are a big fan of Emoji's I'd wait a bit as they don't have support for it yet. They have everything else, just not that. If you are a fan of it (I am but I love the keyboard to much to care) then I'd recommend GO SMS Pro, I hear they have support.The battery life is pretty standard. Just remember to close all of your apps with the task manager every couple of hours. It's got a good camera. Well above what I thought it was going to have. The flash is really bright and the auto-focus is a dream. I also really love the front facing camera. If you are a big fan of picture apps then this is a big plus.There is something that I want to warn you about. There will be something called the VM Pack or Mobile ID something, that it will ask you to download. Just don't it'll change the whole layout and then you'll have to go into the settings to manually change everything back and it's a hassle. If you like the interface how it is fresh out of the box (and you will) then ignore it.The apps run beautifully. They don't lag or anything. I downloaded Temple Run 2 (I didn't even know they had that) and played that for a while. It's really nice.The screen is pretty bright. You'll forget that it's not turned all the way up if you are indoors however outside, you'll want to beware of the sun as it makes the screen seem quite dim.There isn't much bloatware. It's just a few Google/Samsung products that you'll actually end up using.So yea that's all I have to say on the phone as of now. I do recommend getting a case. It's quite slippery. I got one for like 4.54 including tax in a gorgeous Blue color and it's quite nice. Adds a small bit of wait but makes the phone see,s bit more protected.

The intercept was ok but the overall speed was atrocious.  Upgraded to the Reverb with Android 4.0. Even with a single core, the speed is great.  This phone has a good display.  The extensive use of plastic helps keep the phone weight down.  However, this does make the phone slippery and potentially fragile.  You will definitely want to get a case and cover for this phone.  The screen toggle button is on the top right of the phone and is on the smaller side.  This can take some getting used to.  The phone is 3g but for the money I can't complain too much.  I do use wi-fi when possible.  My main beef with this phone is that the camera does a poor job with close up shots of text and bar codes.  Perhaps a future software update can address this.11/4/2012 - Forgot to mention the Reverb comes with a transparent screen cover on it.  It has a tab so you can remove the entire cover.  I just removed the tab and it use it as my poor man's screen protector :)3/4/2013 - Still no patches for the terrible barcode focus / scanning problem.

If you should decide not to use the new wallpaper pack, you can always switch back to your previous Factory-State preference by way of Choose ID Pack via the Mobile ID widget.I was upset that I couldn't use my original $25.00 phone plan with this phone, as I was told that I had to pay a $15.00 charge to transfer my older VM number to the new phone and pay the new monthly charge of $35.00, so I opted for the upgrade of $10.00 more per month @ $45.00 and get 1200 minutes.This phone is alot faster than my previous Optimus V.

I thought it was good with ICS Android but it is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH JELLY BEAN FROM WHAT I've FOUND OUT. Samsung knows all about this and after 1 Virgin replacement (Bought from Best Buy) and THEN 2 SAMSUNG DIRECT REPAIRS its worse than the beginning. They just told me they repaired it as per request but as soon as out of the box INSTANT RANDOM REBOOTS! Same thing with the Samsung Ring too since the internals are almost the same. Do NOT Buy these Cells unless you want to have a useless phone withing a week to a month.Mine reboots at anytime whether Wake Up, App touch, During text and almost anything. Plus after the Samsung Repair it now has an occasional endless boot loop.

I'm just pissed off at their attitude.They told Virgin to Update from Android ICS to JB by their thorough testing which was a joke.Virgins kind of caught in between now.I always look at benchmarks first to see what your getting for your money and this one is low.Using Performance Benchmarks lets you see EXACTLY where these cells fit in the power and performance range. You can download the Passmark Test from Google Play yourself and run several for an average but make sure all open Apps are closed and reboot once.

Here's why:After the Android update mentioned on other reviews, the phone does indeed freeze up every so often. You need to hold the power button down for a minute until it restarts itself. Of course, the phone has a panic sensor and freezes at the exact worst time when you need to make a call.The screen responsiveness is pretty mediocre; I can type better & faster on my old 2nd Generation Ipod. I installed Go Keyboard and only modest improvement. If you have fat fingers like me, beware. I am constantly mistyping things and autocorrect is awful.The phone does get bogged down when multitasking. Running something like Pandora and GPS Navigation simultaneously while driving will drain the battery even when plugged in. The phone gets toasty hot in the process. So, if you're in for a long car ride, decide which is more important because it can't handle much more than 4 hours of both -- even plugged into the car adapter and you start off fully charged.That said, for this price range, it's pretty good, especially considering the monthly savings by not being locked into a contract. But at this point you can probably do better if you can spring 50 bucks more. I am still happy overall as I can use Skype to make overseas calls for cheap, check the weather and look up restaurants on yelp when out of town. But, I wish it had a bit more oomph.One thing of Note with Virgin Mobile: It only works in the US. You travel out of the country, there is no way to use the phone except over wifi at a hotel or so. There does not appear to be any roaming plan one can buy which was a bummer on our vacations abroad this summer.Old review:I was one of those people who still had a \"dumb phone\" -- I refused to pay $80+ a month on a contract carrier to have a smartphone. Once I learned of Virgin Mobile, I could not wait to drop the contract. I ended up getting this phone, I was debating between this one and the HTC Evo V and the HTC One V. The Evo had some terrible reviews concerning battery life and connectivity, plus the 3 D camera seemed like a dumb gimmick. The HTC One V has a smaller screen and no front facing camera (I wanted to be able to do video calls). I live in a mostly rural area and 4G is practically nonexistent so I did not feel like shelling out $100 extra for a 4G phone (e.g. the Galaxy SII) that would only work in whenever I would take a trip to a large metro area. Once they expand the 4G LTE network to my area I may consider getting an upgrade but I presume that is still some time away.The Samsung reverb fits all these requirements perfectly. I have family overseas so I really wanted to be able to do video calls on Skype. This works great when connected to WiFi, and can even do voice calls with Skype if the 3G signal is strong. Battery life is good, I get about 2 days but I am a light user -- I just use it to check the news or email every couple of hours -- I don't spend hours gaming or texting each day. I love streaming music with it while at the gym or at the office. I may get a bigger SD card and put all my music on it and have it as backup to my iPod, which is getting kinda old.The camera pictures do come out rather shaky and blurry. Other than that, it runs pretty smooth. The transition from landscape to horizontal is a bit shaky, it always takes a few seconds to register you have turned it. So, as others have reviewed, is it the best out there? No. But pretty good enough especially if you are a non-power user. Watch for fluctuating prices here on Amazon and Virgin, I spent 2 weeks watching the price go up and down $30.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "STEER CLEAR: update to jelly bean has Ruined this phone", "Author": "... \"Johnny7\"", "ReviewID": "REQPPZ5HUFAR3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "UPDATE on 23 June 2013: I've revised this to 2 stars instead of 1 star because i'm holding out hope that Samsung/Virgin will get issues resolved w/a new OTA update at some point.  But since updating to jb, i've had nothing but problems with this phone.  It's a shame because, as you can see from my glowing review from before (the part that follow this updated review) I really liked the Reverb when it was running on ICS.  but now it freezes up at lockscreen with regularity and, worse, I suddenly lose all my internal (rom) memory!  I called Samsung tech support and supervisor said they know that the update is not working for this phone but he couldn't be sure when a fix would be issued.  I would NOT buy this phone unless/until they figure out how to make it right again.  What a shame that a once reliable phone is now the cause of so much frustration.  I feel like I've lost all the $ put into buying this phone and accessories for it.  I'm hoping Samsung will stand behind its product and do right by its customers.  and SOON.  Depending on how this gets resolved, I may not even be sticking with Virgin.  I've read many recent reviews on their site w/ppl complaining that Virgin is only replacing phones with refurbs that have same problems.  (that's because it's the new OS that's the problem and until that software/firmware is resolved, nothing else will fix it)  This phone would be better off if they just returned the OS back to ICS, but I doubt they'll do that.  Again, steer clear of this phone.  The recent negative reviews are true.  You've been warned .........OLD REVIEW:Got this phone during Black Friday sale for hundred bucks so couldn't justify paying 3x that for the newly released Galaxy S2.  This phone has not disapointed, esp coming off the LG Optimus V. It's an upgrade in every possible way.  ICS is great and, while the 2gb of internal memory that's available isn't spacious by today's standards, it's still plenty for loading up a raftfull of apps n games.  The 1.4ghz processor is more than serviceable and  can handle even  some of the more demanding games on the market such as Dead Trigger w/nary a lag.  I liked the physical build features of my old Optimus V and this phone shares a number of them:  there's an actual camera button, a solid volume rocker, an external microsd card slot that isn't hidden under the battery cover and the power button on top has worked w/out a single glitch (some others have reported that it sticks but, thankfully, not the case with my phone) The 4\" screen is very good tho could have a little more contrast.  (this is where the GS2 woiuld prob really outshiine the Reverb w/bigger Superamoled screen)  Still, overall this display  is just fine.  My poweramp music player sounds just great pumping music through the single speaker on back, as do other apps like Google Music and TuneIn radio.  Battery life has also been more than adequate, going most days on a single charge.  Have also heard that this phone now has root access so that's another positive for those looking to go custom rom route.  Adding a case and screen protector (liquid iq shield) has  made this phone feel very solid and safe.  It also accepts 64gb microsd card. (just insert in phone w/nothing more to do.)  Regarding that pesky \"ID pack download\" that is always ready to install, I finally installed it w/no damage done.  I just returned to my Nova Launcher as deafault.  Didn't seem to take much internal memory away either, which was my main fear.  (I didn't download any additional ID packs tho, either)  Finally, call quality is excellent!  Can't comment much about the camera as I've not taken many pix but it does have a nice UI and from what i've read, is pretty decent.

At least I won't have to keep telling it I don't want to update it.\" BIG MISTAKE!!! My phone volume has not been loud enough since the change, but the biggest problem is that it runs LIKE MOLASSES! Even such a simple task as opening the contacts, or even opening the phone app take FOREVER. I've pretty much given up on texting people in a timely fashion and just call them as it is easier and faster than waiting for the darn keyboard and messaging app to load. I can't use the internet as everything takes too long to load. The phone also randomly reboots again, and sometimes the screen locks up while I am doing things like talking to people on the phone, so I can't disconnect calls and have to hold the power button until it reboots. I tried doing the various troubleshooting steps for this known issue, to no avail.

I did all the fixes and even removed screen lock but it still freezes regularly.2. My SD Card became corrupted after the constant hard resets (5 - 7 daily).3. I had to remove the Google Play Music app because it ran constantly after the update and was chewing through the battery.4. My battery life sucks after the upgrade and barely lasts 5 hours with minimal activity.5. All apps lag terribly now. If I press the phone button, I now have to wait 30 secs before my screen displays.6. My phone no longer recognizes or can play MP3 songs.7.

Horrible waste of money considering that I paid full price for it. Don't waste your time on this phone.I called Virgin Mobile and they gave me a fix to completely reset the phone back to Icecream Sandwich. Not certain why they pushed the Jellybean update because that update is intended for dual-core phones and this is a single core phone. I found an app called SMS Backup and Restore to save my text messages before the reset since most of my other phone settings are backed up to the Web. I have not tried the fix yet but will update the review after I do so.Update: 10/9/13I didn't find time to do the Virgin Mobile update but it worked out well because the latest Samsung update appears to have fixed all the issues the first Jellybean update caused. The Android version is still 4.1.2 but the phone is so much smoother now. The battery stays charged all day - 76% to 85% at the end of the day with minimal use rather than completely dead like it was just a few days before. The phone has not frozen a single time in 4 days.

It has exceeded all my expectations in the price range. While it does feel slightly fragile, it feels good in the hand, and very lightweight. The screen is of very good quality, and after clearing the default launcher to use the stock ICS launcher, I love this phone. The interface is clean, and easily managed. It operates at a reasonable speed, even with CPU throttling enabled under power saving (an awesome feature, btw). Battery life is exceptional for the specs and size of this phone.In my opinion, this phone is the best overall value for the carrier.My only real gripe, is that Samsung has an emulated \"SD card\" built into the phone separate from any installed SD card, and as such this phone does not allow moving apps to the SD card. The good news is, there is plenty of internal memory available for apps, and while Virgin Mobile's \"Mobile ID\" software is present on the firmware, and unable to be removed, it is possible to disable it and it has not bugged me since.EDIT - 11/13/2012After spending some more time with this phone, I have deemed it unacceptable for my demands. Granted, I only had it for temporary use while my iPhone 5 is unavailable (long story) so I've got some pretty high demands when it comes to a phone, this one, while being the best in Virgins' lineup (in my opinion) is still just not very good, especially not for the price.When first using it, after reverting to the stock ICS launcher (TouchWiz is an abomination), it seems fine, but even after installing nothing but Facebook on the phone, it begins to get very laggy (a problem I haven't had on many ICS devices), and also can get very warm. I actually had 2 of these over the course of a couple of weeks, and returned both because the led backlights on the bottom buttons just stopped working periodically, even when set to \"always on\". Battery life became abysmal, with no apps installed or running, brightness on the lowest setting, and pretty much any and all battery-draining services disabled.I still say this is the best Virgin Mobile phone (except the comically overpriced iPhone options), but it is still just not very good, especially in the price range. I ended up jumping ship to Boost Mobile (basically the same as Virgin Mobile, same network, etc.) and picked up the Galaxy S2 for $369. I've been very pleased with that so far, and it performs very well for its price class, considering that Sprint (who also owns both these companies) sells the S2 contract-free for $699. If you can afford an extra $100, I suggest looking into that instead. Service options are the same, same price, same network, only Boost has better phones, and shrinking payments.Just my .02", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Avoid this phone.. only read latest reviews", "Author": "SW", "ReviewID": "RN6DJ66AGM2DJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "On the surface, Reverb appears to be good phone. Cheap price, great reviews and runs the latest Android software. And Virgin had some of the best pricing for smart phone plans.Problem as stated by some of the latter reviews is the auto-update to Jelly Bean turns the phone turn into an battery draining, software hanging dog of a phone. Maybe this is how Samsung is trying to get people to upgrade their phone. Just roll-out a release to make you hate your current phone. They just should have not allowed the release on this phone. I didn't see a permanent way to avoid having the release or rolling back to previous release.The screen is unbearable in direct sunlight. Makes it very difficult to take photos of your family out in the park. And dimming the screen is needed to make the battery last. Can literally be impossible to see the screen outside.Some of the cool apps that I wish worked great actually fail. Google Hangout works for a bit and then hangs. I was using Wi-Fi so it should have worked. Also, for some reason the buttons at the bottom of the phone become unresponsive and make it impossible to click the \"home\" button. I wish these were real buttons and not capacitive buttons. Since you have no feedback I wasn't sure if it was me or the phone. But its the phone.This is my first smart phone. I switched from a flip phone that had a battery that lasted weeks even with several calls. This sound is decent but sometimes is robotic sounding. Maybe it was because I had less bars than my Verizon flip phone. But I had less bars in a lot of areas in town. Data connection is actually pretty good. So, email and simple apps that use the Internet run great (eg. banking app). I wanted less bells and whistles but you might be better off a bigger phone with more memory if Samsung auto-updates the OS.I like Virgin Mobile and the do allow upgrading a better phone without penalty.

I wanted a good amount of time to see how the phone and virgin mobile holds up in my area of central coast california.The Phone:The phone is a decent size. It is not tiny but it isnt the monster like the Galaxy S2 that people are so fond of these days. Its light and fits in all my pants pockets very well. The phone has very rounded edges and overall very smooth. It is a good balance between screen size and comfort.Camera: This is one of the weakest points of the phone for me. The camera always gives you fine grains in the image even when turning the sharpness off and going to the highest resolution. 5 mp is just enough to make decent pictures but dont expect to blow them up and put them on a wall. Plenty for people who want facebook photos.Front Facing Camera:Mostly for skype as the pictures it takes are very low quality and have to many digital artifacts. The face unlock screen for security  works but it can be defeated by using a picture in front of the camera. So I prefer to use a pin number to keep my phone secure.Battery Life:The battery life on the phone is decent lasting all day web browsing and watching netflix on my phone. I have let the phone go a few days without charging when I am only texting and calling.  But generally it should be a good idea to charge any phone when you get the chance because you never know when you may be without a charge and you dont want a dead phone in an emergency.System: The ice cream sandwitch 4.0 is a decent system with common and farmiliar andriod feel we have all come to know and that has become the 2/3 of the phone market.Virgin Mobile:the coverage in my area is pretty good. A few times I have traveled to berkley a 2 hour drive away for a concert and to San Jose a 40minute drive away and I would check my bars and 3g along the way. A few times I have seen the bar drop to One and none. BUT every time I go to make a call my bars average 3. And that is really what counts is when you make a call or send a text that you get too.Overall:  The only thing that seriously brought down to a 4 is that it randomly restarts itself once a day at least and sometimes up to 5. Never in the middle of a call or text, but happens usually after being online or on charge unattended for a spell. Its no big deal since most times it happens when on the charge or in my pocket and I here the restart song my phone plays.The phone and service are not solid pieces of fried gold. I came from Verizon to Virgin mobile. Is Verizon faster?... yes.... Does verizon have better coverage?... yes... BUT my monthly verizon bill was $106 every month for almost 3 years. My Virgin bill is $49. So I can pay two months for the price of one. And given that Verizon no longer goes unlimited if I would have signed a new contract my bill would have been $120 a month with Verizon. And yes I know that verizon is the best overall, but at almost 3 times the price thats madness.Yeah sprints network has slower 3g and 4g. Yeah their coverage isnt what verizon or at&t; is. But for $49 a month I have 1200 minutes, unlimited texting, and unlimited data. If you do your homework and check the converage maps for your area you should have a good idea of how the phone will work for you.

Despite that, 2 gbs is way more space to play around with than my old 170 mb, which was a headache to have to always work around. I'm still on the honeymoon phase since I only had this phone since the 9th, but I definitely agree with others on it being one of the best on the VM line up.If you are a gamer who plans to play games such as Chaos Rings or Final Fantasy, I would suggest you go for the Galaxy S II instead because you will definitely need the space. If you are like me and only plan to run apps that are 50 mbs or less, then this is the phone for you! As for the actual service, I didn't have any qualms at all setting it up.

Affordable can be a relative term, so I will clarify even more.  I was looking for something like $80/month for me and my wife.  Back in the Spring of 2013, I started looking and I checked out the mainstream cellphone providers (ATT, Verizon, etc.), but they all seemed to push us into the $120 - $130 range.  I started looking at the no-contract options with the main providers and the rates came down, but you had to buy a pretty expensive phone.  I went to the smaller no-contract providers and out of them it was fairly even.  It mostly came down to a coverage question.  I found that Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile (who lease from Sprint), had the best coverage although not like the main providers.  I started looking for phone deals in both and found the Reverb to be a good capacity smartphone for a the money ($130).  I bought two.  I can say that there are days that I really appreciate the phone because it provides all the things you need fundamentally from a smartphone.  But, there are a few things that frustrate me: 1) battery life is bad.  If you are constantly using the phone you have to develop a discipline to keep it plugged in even during the day because the battery drains quickly.  2) Virgin Mobile coverage is spotty.  I live in the Modesto area, where the coverage is pretty good, but just outside of it in surrounding communities, the coverage lowers significantly.  3) the phone initially froze a lot, but now it seems okay.  I think they did a system update to fix the bug. 4) the phone is a bit slow.  5) back camera does not work with QR code reading.  I have to use the front camera, which is totally annoying.

The first thing you should know is that if you haven't have a smart phone before this will excite you. I spent far too much time playing with my new 'toy.' If you've had a smartphone before you may or may not be entirely pleased.Apps work fine and there is no shortage of freeware to go around. I would be careful with how much you download because the phone only has about 2G of space. That seems like a lot but it's really not. If you want to fill it up, I'd recommend a microSD card (which is has a slot for). The screen is bright enough, though it could be brighter. Still I have no complaints.The service has been great (I checked the map BEFORE buying the phone/plan), though there was one minor hiccup. When I moved to a new location, the phone failed to pick up the 3G even though it should have. My SO bought a different phone but also under Virgin mobile and he managed to pick it up fine. If you have this problem you can probably factory reset. Instead what I did was update to the Android 4.1.2. I have no idea what OS this is -called.- Once I updated, it mapped onto the 3G and I've had no problems since.The update HAS slowed the phone down. It use to be much faster and now it runs a bit more snail-like. This is frustrating but OK. I have had a few problems with the phone but on rare occasions. Just recently the screen locked and wouldn't let me swipe it. I restarted it (held the power button until it just shut off) and it seems to be working normally. IF you can find a way to make it stop nagging you about the 4.1.2 update, then I'd recommend it and not update the OS.Otherwise I'm fairly happy with the phone. I would recommend it to someone who wants a smartphone without being destroyed financially. If you look at the map of coverage before buying the phone then you will get great coverage and a great plan for minimal price. I pay the $35 for unlimited data, unlimited text and limited calls.

The Sony was a gorgeous work of art to hold and admire, but had lots of bugs and faults (probably more related to its dated Android Gingerbread OS).  The Samsung Galaxy Reverb is just the opposite: not much to look at but works flawlessly and reliably.The phone itself looks cheaply made, with a flimsy, slippery back that makes it hard to hold without a case.  In fact, less than an hour after owning it, it slipped out of my hand and fell onto a hardwood floor.  The back cover and battery flew off.  Luckily after putting everything back together the phone worked just fine.  Recommendation: get a rubberized case.  It will make it easier to hold and help hide the cheapness of the case.Other than the appearance, I have no complaints at this time.  Call quality in both speaker and handset mode is excellent.  Most apps work well (although some are a bit slow but about what you'd expect for the price), and 3G/WiFi data access are seamless.  Virgin Mobile's 3G data speeds (Sprint) are adequate for most web browsing and e-mail applications, video might take a bit longer to stream (get used to seeing the \"buffering\" message\").  The battery life is getting better as the phone gets broken in, but a good battery saver app will help that quite a bit.All in all, the Samsung Galaxy Reverb is a good all-around Android phone that does almost everything pretty well, except for impressing your friends.", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "Terrisa", "ReviewID": "R11CWVI5Z4U0SJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the same phone for about three years and it has been getting slower and slower.

If you like being frustrated, this is the phone for you!  The Reverb loves to stop working at the most inopportune moments, like when you're GPSing your way around a new state or trying to check your email for your flight confirmation number.  God forbid you try to both take a picture and listen to Pandora.  Satan's Reverb will laugh in your face at the mere thought of multi-tasking.  I'm on my second Reverb, and phone number two seems to have been crafted by the Devil's minions themselves.  This phone will constantly slide out of your hand, pocket, purse, cleavage, ect. and delights in smashing itself on the ground and hurling its case and back cover off.  Hopefully you like to text, because then you will get a taste of the best part of this beauty: its total inability to display a keyboard in a timely fashion.  If it's an emergency, you'll probably want to just call the person.  Satan's phone is known to shut down all touch responsiveness the moment someone is trying to call you.  You will need to reboot it in order to try to return the call.  But good luck!  Often the battery needs to be removed completely, so don't bring this phone with you in a blizzard because the more you rely on it the more likely it is that you will freeze to death before it deigns to assist you.

Extremely sluggish, poor battery life, and unreliable.

At best, if I did not use the phone at all, I could get the battery to last about 24 hrs.  I finally did a complete factory reset on it and avoided installing ANY apps, including the Virgin Mobile ID package.  That way, I resolved the screen freeze problem and was able to get the battery to last about 2.5 days max.  Performance still slow however.  Even using my home wifi network, it would take forever for the phone to load a single webpage.In addition to all these frustrations that render this phone pretty much useless, I would regularly get text messages a day late or miss phone calls that simply did not even register.

After reading all the glowing reviews, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  What a HUGE disappointment.  I got the phone activat4ed without any problem, but from the first, the sound quality was deplorable.  I have a Virgin Mobile Assurance phone, and i thought the sound quality on that was terrible, but the sound on the Reverb is equally terrible.  My friends tell me that it is no better on their end.  Then I tried to download a ringtone.  The phone could not  handle that, 24 hours later, and it still refuses to download any file.  It simply keeps telling me to sign in the the VM site, despite the fact that I am already signed in.  I e-mailed and phoned Virgin Mobile tech support, and received a return e-mail with detailed instructions which did no good at all.  I also spent over 4 1/2 on the phone with nine different tech support reps and two supervisors.  Not one person out of the eleven had a clue as to how to solve the problem.  Just as in the e-mail, they simply had me deactivate and then reactivate the phone repeatedly.  I do not mean simply turn the phone on and off, but literally wipe out the activation information and start from scratch.  Again, with no solution to either the sound problem or the download problem.  They checked the tower coverage to see if an outage might be responsible, but said that all the towers were up and operating, and that I had full coverage.  As I said, I was excited about this phone based on the myriad of gushing reviews, not only here on Amazon, but on other sites as well.  For my part, at least, this was a total waste of money.  I am no better off than with the cheap little Kyocera Assurance phone which coincidentally is also from Virgin Mobile.
