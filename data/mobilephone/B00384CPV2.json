As far as the picture messaging goes for T-Mobile you can find their generic settings by Googling \"T-Mobile generic MMS settings\". On the phone tap Menu/Messages/Settings/Multimedia messages/Profiles/Create/Set name. Call it T-Mobile MMS and then enter the settings. Alternatively you can try to find a nice customer service rep at a \"real\" store, they'll do it for you. It's not one of their phones so some of their reps might say no (but it is your service plan, so they usually say yes).As far as the startup language goes, the instructions that came with my phone said to insert the SIM card first, prior to doing anything else to have it come up in English instead of German. I noticed that afterwards but knew enough German to find the right setting.

The phone itself is really cute and the touch screen is easy. I use T-Mobile and had no problem getting my plan switched over from Blackberry to this phone. All I did was insert the sim card and called t-mobile who walked me through setting up the phone's web set up. I am having a hard time with web access though and using MMS. The phone won't allow me to use both, so I manually have to switch between mobile and MMS profiles. There may be a way to do this, but I haven't figured it out yet. The tools on my widget bar also are not working on t-mobile's network. I LOVE the phone. I just don't know how to do everything yet.

I got it for my thirteenth birthday a couple months ago. At first I liked it, but it got old REALLY fast. It doesn't have threaded messaging like I would have hoped. The touch screen is fine. Not too sensitive. Camera is okay. Kinda blury :/. The side keyboard is bad. I usually just use the T9 mode when I text. Not many text tones to choose from. About four. One good thing is that you can use recordings as ringtones. Good vibriation for the most part. One thing that pissed me off is that you have to like email T-mobile to actually send and recieve picture messages and the like. It was a HUGE hassle! Good radio and reception. Cute outisde. It is also VERY SMALL. Also, it hasn't froze up yet, but would NOT be surprised if it did. It's good for younger girls that want a cute, touchscreen phone, but for older girls/teenagers/women, it's not a good phone. Maybe try the LG unlocked Xenon cell phone.
