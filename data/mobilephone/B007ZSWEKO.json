Unfortunately, the menu system is overly complicated and the user manual is the worst I've experienced.  It is not user-friendly to set up in that it requires extensive menu-surfing.  Still not bad for the price.*The following is my revised review:Two weeks after my above comments, more information has been obtained - no thanks to T-Mobile. The manual provided in the box from a T-Mobile store did not match the TO 665 cell phone menu system.  A \"Getting Started\" guide was not included and should have been.  It is available as a PDF download at the T-Mobile web site support link.  The OT 665 User Manual is also available as a PDF download at the T-Mobile site but doesn't match the phone's menu system either.For the correct User Manual, got to the Alcatel web site support link for the OT 665 phone.  The web site is: ALCATELONETOUCH.COM/USA.  Click SUPPORT, click DOWNLOAD then select the One Touch 665.  The next screen will provide the download links for the correct User Manual and the Quick User Guide.  Also available for download is the Alcatel PC Suite V.7.0.36 which allows PC management of the phone's contacts and multimedia content.  A USB data cable is necessary and the driver software is included as part of the Suite's PC installation.Even though it may display the T-Mobile name of the front of the phone, it is an Alcatel product and that's where we need to go for the proper support.T-Mobile 665 Prepaid Phone (T-Mobile)", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad for what it is.", "Author": "R.

The replacement WORKS VERY WELL with NO PROBLEMS. I added a star to my rating. If I'd gotten this phone first, I'd probably have given the phone 4 stars. But, primarily because of my very poor customer service experience, I'm leaving it as a 3-star rating.This review is NOT about Amazon service. It's about the T-Mobile/Alcatel 665 phone and T-Mobile service. I did NOT buy this phone from Amazon. I bought it directly from T-Mobile.On the good side (yes, there is a good side to this phone):1. Very light and portable2. Great MP3 player3. Nifty FM radio w/decent receptionDOWNSIDES:1. DROPPED CALLS--I mean ALL THE TIME. I've been a T-Mobile customer for well over a decade. There are currently 4 T-Mobile users in my household. None of my previous phones (for the past 7 years or so, anyway) EVER dropped calls--not once. The other, non-665 T-Mobile users, NEVER experience dropped calls. My phone--this 665--drops calls w/absolutely no warning. I show full bars--all the time--then...BANG...dropped call. More on this in a minute.2. Ridiculous, Inconvenient UI/Menu system. Certainly the worst visual UI I've worked with on a phone. I STILL can't even find where to check my phone log. If this is there, it is NOT on the first level of menus.3. Output volume. Despite my praise for the MP3 player, the amplitude out of the headphone jack is so small that the only device I've tried that is usable is the earbud system that came with the phone. These are okay, but if you lose these or they break, then you'll have to find a direct replacement. I've tried four other earbuds and headsets and the output volume is unacceptably low for all three of these. -T-MOBILE SERVICE for this phone -- NEGATIVE 2 Stars...TERRIBLEI bought this phone at the T-Mobile store in Issaquah WA. 2 weeks after I bought this phone, I took it in because of the dropped calls. They replaced the ancient SIM card, which I'd installed from my 6-year-old 2G T-Mobile Samsung. That seemed reasonable. They assured me they'd never had problems with this phone and that this would for sure fix the dropped call problems. I gave it another couple of weeks. BAD MOVE. When I returned, apparently I'd just gone over the 30-day mark and T-Mobile wanted $20 before giving me another phone. Sheesh. This policy was verified and stipulated by the local T-Mobile manager and the central T-Mobile support group. This is an absurdly consumer-hostile attitude.Just a warning to all.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "my 1st phone", "Author": "PLutoc", "ReviewID": "R76K7RCWQMJVS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had never had a phone and I am 23 years of age. The reason I chose this phone is because it's simple and it functions for what I needed it for (texting and phone calls). I didn't want a high tech smart phone, so I searched for a flip phone that was simple, easy to access, looked slick and plain (and it came in my favorite colour, Blue). Fortunately, this phone has been useful and has worked well (I received it on Sept. 7th) !! The downside of it is that the camera sucks, and there is no volume control (well that I haven't found, at least), but over all, I do recommend this phone for anyone that desires simplicity. My mom liked it and was thinking of getting one, she's quite old school and wants an easy phone as well.

My parents had large fancy smartphones and it was driving me nuts having to troubleshoot with them every day and constantly having calls rejected, phones stuck on airplane mode, muted volume, dead batteries, deleted contacts, frozen or nonresponsive phones, and a million other things that can go wrong with super fancy technology and old people. These phones were a godsend. There are no volume buttons to accidently mute, no way to butt dial with a clamshell, actual physical buttons to push, no millions of extraneous things that detract from the main calling function. It works well as a phone, with a loud enough ringer, speaker phone, good reception, great battery life, and a durable and tossable body you don't have to worry about baby-ing since it is so cheap you could always get a new one. For the price of one mid-range smartphone, you can get two dozen of these to pass around at your next birthday bash. And in five years time they will still be going strong too, even with dozens of drops and the occasional angry hurling at people's heads.I am actually a smartphone enthusiast and I change my smartphone every six months to the latest and greatest bleeding edge thing. But in-between the downtimes I use this as my temp phone and man is it a breath of fresh air. Something that just WORKS, is no nonsense, and I can just slam on the table without a care.

I needed to port my phone number from my VoIP provider to Google Voice, but Google Voice can only port in mobile phone numbers.

I barely used this phone, but for the extremely low price it seemed like a decent phone if you need to keep things simple and inexpensive.  The buttons were nice and large and the screen was fairly easy to read.  The menu navigation was a little weird until you got the hang of it.  It is so amazing how low the price is for this phone, especially since there is no contract.

Like all clamshell styled phones, it's BASIC. If you are thinking about using it as something other than a phone, then you have \"some\" options, but DO NOT think that t his is a substitute for any other device. I use it for making and receiving important/emergency calls. For those purposes, it's really very adequate.AS A PHONE - The design is nice and slim, and the buttons are very large, which makes it very convenient for people with poor eyesight. The buttons, however, are very FLAT, so dialing is occasionally less than \"smooth\", and you won't be able to dial by \"feel\", but will actually have to look at the keypad when you dial. Since this phone (like every phone out there) can store your contact numbers, that shouldn't be too inconvenient. The reception is good, but that's more a function of your service provider than the phone. If you're looking for a nice basic phone that fits very comfortably into your pocket, this is ideal.TEXTING - As mentioned, the keypad is extremely FLAT, and the input modes are somewhat non-intuitive. If you text a lot, this is not the phone for you.EXTRA FEATURES - The fact that this phone comes with an MP3 player and an FM radio is very appealing for people who want to listen to something while they travel. Be warned...this is not the premier MP3 player. These features are \"extras\". Don't go confusing this with some of those smart-phones. Considering the price, this is actually a great little unit, but there are some limitations that people should be aware of.The MP3 playing software seems determined to limit the user to just 600 songs. Any other songs that you wish to listen to should be placed into a different folder, accessed MANUALLY, and played one at a time using the filemanager funtion (it's right there in the menu, so it isn't too inconvenient). Still, 600 songs is a lot to choose from for a steady stream of music, and playing additional songs (one at a time) is still possible. I have well over a thousand songs stored on the card (my 8 gig micro SD is filled), and if I feel like listening to one that is not in the main MUSIC FOLDER, it's only a few button-taps away. One \"work around\" is to simply transfer an entire group of songs from your CD as a single MP3 (such as side B of Abbey Road and a lot of Pink Floyd albums).Other comments have noted that there is no volume control. This is untrue. Just press the Up/Down keys WHILE THE SONG IS PLAYING. The low volume of the unit can be overcome by getting a better set of headphones. I'm using the JVC Gumy HAF160s (I don't use the headset for phone conversations, so that's fine). These headphones seem perfectly matched to this MP3 player, and the volume is more than adequate.I have also read that the construction seems a bit flimsy. Yes. It SEEMS that way, but being abit of a klutz, I've dropped this phone 4 times, and so far, everything is still working FINE.The menus are not very intuitive, but you will get used to it, and you can always CONSULT THE MANUAL. It isn't hard. Overall, I'd say this is  a very good basic phone (but quite weak on texting, which I never do so it made no difference to me), and comes with enough extras to make it an excellent purchase.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible", "Author": "June Visintainer", "ReviewID": "R3986DPYPSQD9S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone 4 months ago.

But I didn't feel like getting another android phone or apple, especially with news of the upcoming Nexus and iPhone 6 later this year. So I decided to tough it out and get a basic flip phone. Just 8 years ago touch screen smart phones were barely coming in and people were crazy about getting latest and greatest bar, flip or slider :) I want to gain an appreciation of wireless phone technology by removing the clutter of apps, finicky OS's, short battery life, featureless slabs of gorilla glass and sky high prices.I chose this phone for its utter simplicity and long battery life. It's running smoothly for me no hiccups at all. With my SGSII I had gotten into the habit of charging it every night. But with this phone Alcatel 665 I haven't had to charge for three days before one of the bars disappeared. Reception with tmobile in my area was better than the galaxy and at times was more accurate at reading service availability.Operating the phone Is pretty basic and you'd be able to figure stuff out pretty easily. Just make sure you go through all the submenus, cuz they hold extra tidbits of information -sometimes important ones. Comes with one battery, micro USB charger, instructions and a SIM card.

The phone I bought came with a kit including the phone itself, the charger, headphones, a SIM card, and instructions on how to use and activate it. Was able to get it to just work easily.I like this phone for the fact that it can make calls, listen to radio stations, take pictures, record videos/audio, and can act like a MP3 player.Its possible to text and send messages to people and its even possible to add your own ringtones and wallpapers besides the ones that came installed.The Softkeys and Numberic keys can be set as a speed dial for a personal number OR set to one of the functions on the menu (Radio, Alarm, etc.) and comes with a Calendar that can be used to set up \"Appointments\" (The phone rings on a specific date).It has a Converter that can convert currency, length (M, Cm, Km), and weight (Kg) and also has a Calculator, Bluetooth, Stopwatch, Notes, and Weather.An alarm is included so you can set it up to ring like on the Calendar. Also vibrates, has Caller ID, and can display the time and status of the phone while its closed with a push of a button.If I were to describe what it could do better most is in its navigation. Even with the manual I still had to explore it a bit to get a good handle on what it can or can't do. Also changed some settings because it was somewhat difficult to understand what the phone displayed on some parts. (Like setting Languages to USEnglish instead of Auto, turning Conversational Mode Off in Messages, etc.)The time it displays has to be saved manually every time you want to change it. If you save it by Auto Update it might be off by a minute because of this. Texting messages on the phone is...well what is expected from a number keypad and its camera is nothing too impressive.The online store for this phone lacks somewhat. In the box this phone only has a storage of 3.2 Mb so a Memory Card needs to be obtained elsewhere if saving long videos and songs/audio.Its battery is so-so and only displays how many bars out of 3 it has left. (More or less up to 9 hours of talk, 400 hours on standby like described on the official T-Mobile site)Overall even with its flaws I still like this phone. For what it could do and its price it works for me. Would recommend it for its FM radio, Speed Dial function, Camara, Video recorder, Voice recorder, Alarm/Calendar function, Caller ID/Time and Status display,and for being able to make calls.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "perfect gift for him", "Author": "TONIA", "ReviewID": "R1M6G9EX0AXJIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was purchased for a valentines gift.

Add to that the fact I only paid $22.00 for it. It might not be a Smart phone, but it sure is INTELLIGENT and Strong. It handles the phone conversations well and plays FM Radio and MP3 music plus a ton of other intertainment things. If you need a reliable phone and reliable cell phone company, then the T-Mobile T665 is an excellent option. The fact that it's a Flip Phone is a huge advantage because it eliminates the pocket dialing and screen keyboard keypad breakage.

They tried to tell us we couldn't get this phone for less the $110 after they did the minimum signup they said it required. While standing there waiting for them to figure out their own system, I used my smart phone to pull up reviews. Amazon came up, I saw the price, and shut down the sale right then and there.This phone came in, I charged it, swapped in the sim card from her dying phone, and it just worked.
