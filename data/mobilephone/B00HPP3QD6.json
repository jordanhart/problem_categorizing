I was using another $99 prepaid Android phone and it was painful to say the least. Slow, bug ridden etc. This phone allows you to have a mid range phone for a low end price. The Moto G completely blows away all other phones in it's price range and many that are retail for $200-$300!Since Google owns Motorola you're able to get this phone at a great price AND has a guaranteed update to KitKat! The ONLY downside is the 8GB storage and no microSD slot. Personally, I am not a heavy app user or gamer and I transfer my photos to my laptop often as well as switch out my music.

I primarily use phone as a Kindle reader which it has worked well. Be advised the G stands for Google and it definitely has a presence on the phone.  The phone is inexpensive so if I break it, I can just buy another.I have been a Verizon pre-paid customer for many years and now I almost want to thank them for making this phone available.

HD screen is vibrant and slick. The size and form factor is perfect for me in that it is neither too small nor stupidly huge.Some very minor negatives:No MicroSD memory expansion (but phone comes with 50GB Google Drive space)1GB RAM (phone can get a little laggy if you open up a bunch of apps and leave them running in the background. Solution - close apps you are not currently using)For some reason the phone back cover feels a little slippery. This can be solved by getting an inexpensive aftermarket phone case (worth while to protect your investment anyway)Not a true negative of the phone itself but just an FYI - Verizon keeps its no-contract phones restricted to 3G. But honestly not a issue for me as their 3G service in my area is good and fast.BOTTOM LINE: At $100, loaded with current tech and features, the Moto G is an excellent value for a no-contract plan.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Reviewed as a WiFi device", "Author": "Bay Area Tech Junkie", "ReviewID": "R1IBP5NUD1ESQH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this up to use as a WiFi device with no immediate intention of activating Verizon prepaid service. The first thing you notice about this phone versus others is that it forces you through an activation process via a phone call with an automated Verizon robot. That was a little disturbing given why I bought it, however if you go through the process, it creates a Verizon account, you set the PIN for the account, and it assigns you a phone number, and the LAST step of the activation process is to enter payment information. If you hang up on the call on the last payment step, the phone will come to life with the assigned phone number, and it works as a WiFi device, even though it now has an assigned Verizon phone number. If you hang up before that point it continues to force you through the process - so go all the way through except payment. I took one star off for forcing customers through this activation process before you can use the phone.As other reviews say, it can't be beat for $99. The 4.5\" form factor is noticably smaller than say the Nexus 5 and Galaxy S3/4, 720P screen is nice, and I also was able to upgrade to Kit Kat 4.4.2 OTA over WiFi. The music player also sounds great.One disturbing note is that leaving it without mobile service and WiFi connected overnight it drained the battery to zero. Putting the device in airplane mode and only turning on WiFi seems to have fixed that - it drained from 100% to 63% overnight with those settings.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exceeded my expectations!", "Author": "Adam Ganey", "ReviewID": "R34UDE4YZ1N35V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Better than I could have asked for.

Mediocre voice quality.", "Author": "Keith H.", "ReviewID": "RX8NZTQBJ7COT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My thirty days are up and I am sending it back.  Sadly so.  Incredible android performance at this price point.  No freezing, glitches, slowdowns or problems of any kind.  Day and a half battery life with modest use.  This is a very solid device that is fun to use.  I am not going to nit pick it to death since that would not be fair.  If you buy one you get A-LOT for your $100.00.My only real issue is the voice quality of my sample.  My ten dollar Samsung Gusto prepaid flip phone blows the Moto G away in voice quality.  Words have a slight buzz on them at the earpiece and a very slight buzz attached to them going out from the mouth mic pickup.  I like it enough that I may explore some blue tooth options  to see if it is possible to get around the call quality issue.  I may also try another one just to make sure it was not my sample.Call quality can fluctuate quite a bit throughout the day on the Verizon network in my area.  The time of day, my device, the tower, other peoples devices and carrier, it all adds up to a lot of potential variables.  When the stars line up and everything is perfect, the call quality of this device is just barely good with most of my calls falling into the mediocre to poor range.  Other callers say that I sound OK, but on my end I have to keep asking people to repeat themselves.  It can become really frustrating and makes talking and driving more dangerous than it already is.  I will not answer this phone while driving.Any android device I use must excel at being a phone first.  This one does not. All of my comments about voice quality are specific to my sample of the Verizon Moto G prepaid device on the Verizon 3G prepaid network.  In general there seems to be an overall decline in the voice quality of the Verizon network.  Even in Consumer Reports magazine I see their phones are not scoring like they used to for voice quality. I don't know if it's a network issue or the way they spec out their devices.  In the 90's to mid 2000's I could always count on Verizon devices for top notch voice quality.  Today it's getting harder and harder to find one of their phones that sounds really good.  I hope they can find a way to reverse this trend since it's one of the fundamentals they built their business on.If voice and photo quality are not important to you and you don't mind the limited storage capacity then it's highly recommended.  The Moto G is a very pleasurable android experience.UPDATE:  6-4-14.  Bought another one just to make sure it was not an issue with the first sample. Call quality on my end is still OK to poor. Calls are not usually very clear but they are usually acceptable.  The Moto G is an absolute delight to use as long as I don't need to make any phone calls with it.  My only other issues has been that the screen is hard to see in bright daylight.  In direct sun it is totally unusable.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "ups and downs", "Author": "Matthew Rummler", "ReviewID": "RVPC0XCTDVKTY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is by far the best phone I've ever owned. I previously owned a ZTE Merit, which was... behind on the times to say the least. What I absolutely loved about this phone was that as soon as I turned it on it updated to android Kit-Kat. (Amazing btw) Seeing as how the screen isn't OLED, it does use a bit more power, which brings me to my next point. On moderate use I get about 12-17 hours use. Much better than the Merit I had before. Another great point about this phone would be its speaker. I work in the back of a busy restaurant and we don't have a radio. We previously used an iPod that we put under a plate to amplify the sound, but now I have to put this phone at only 75% and everyone in the back can hear it.The notification LED is only one color (white)The removable back is just for show, you can't remove the battery, and there is no micro sd card slot. Which is the only downside to this phone, no expandable storage. You're stuck with the 8 gigs they give you. Sure you get 50 free gigs of Google drive storage upon turning the phone on for the first time, but unless you have a constant internet connection that'll be worthless.I highly recommend purchasing the flipshell case from motorolla.

My first major annoyance with this phone was the lack of a physical home button, unlike the iPhone and GS3. After 2 weeks  now with the Moto G I've gotten used to that, but it is still a bit annoying that the digital buttons are part of the actual screen. Again, that's not a deal breaker, just kind of weird that it was designed that way, rather than using the extra space below the screen for the buttons.Overall, for 100 bucks, this is a spectacular phone. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it is not an 8GB phone, as advertised. The phone comes with a total capacity of 5.52 GB, and about 4.5 available GB after the Kit Kat update.Again, for 100 bucks, I am shocked at how great of a phone this is. Its not AS good as an iPhone or a Galaxy phone, but it is actually conparable, for a fraction of the price. If you plan to use your phone to store tons of music and apps, this phone may not be for you (4.5 GB with no SD slot is hardly any space).

I tried calling both numbers from my old phone and got the same response then went on line and tried to use the temporary phone # given to me, my current phone #, and the old account number when trying to sign in -- no dice, kept saying not enough information (despite the fact that the guy who was helping me said that any of those would work if I wanted to go online).  finally used my husband's online account and had a chat session (with another very helpful, courteous person) who explained that the reason for the message about roaming was due to the fact that the device was still in the \"porting process\" and is not actually able to be used as a phone until the # is ported which she said could be up to 72 hours :(.  I'm just beyond 24 hours so, hopefully, it will complete before too long.  I'm happy I still have about 6 days left on my straight talk account because the old device has to be up and running throughout this process.

As a student with a part time job, I need a phone, but in no way can I afford to pay the contract plans everyone - including most of my friends - seem to get.Unless you're entering a contract with a bunch of people, you are going to pay at least 70$ USD per month (depending on carrier, for Verizon you have to pay 40 per month per smartphone and 50 per month for the individual BASE service plan [500 MB cap]) and is just not a good value, unless you HAVE to have the latest smartphone with the best features, such as the beautiful Galaxy Note 3 or the Samsung Galaxy S5. My TOTAL plan cost for this phone with Verizon is 45$ per month flat, and I get unlimited TALK and TEXT, with 500MB of data - AT+T has a similar no contract plan available, and I'm assuming other carriers have close to this per month cost as well.I did a lot of research into what might be good values for no-contract and prepaid phones, and it basically came between this phone (99$ but locked to Verizon), the unlocked version of this phone (199$), the unlocked Galaxy S3 (199$), the iPhone 4 (199$) and the goofy knock-off-Windows Nokia Lumia 520 and 521 (54.99, AT+T// 69.99, T-Mobile). I won't go into the pros/cons of each phone, but this phone had significant points that bought me over.Pros:Snappy Dual-Core processor, perfect for flipping between tasks, opening word documents, browsing the web.. and my favorite, running GameBoy Advance emulators - something you can't do on IPhones (IOS) or windows phones (Nokia Lumia series).8GB of Flash Storage - plenty, to be honest. Remember, you're buying a Smartphone! This means if you want music, you have many outlets, i.e. Pandora, Slacker radio, Youtube, Spotify.. This means the 8GB you are given will go a long way to hold photos or games you might want to install.Google Drive - Cloud storage for your music files, videos you purchase through Google Play, Photos, ect. This is what makes the quantity of storage you get worth it.Office Suite - built in QuickOffice suite is pretty self explanatory; you get a fast little word processing app/spreadsheets/presentations. For jotting down notes (which I do a lot) the Word option is very sufficient.Voice to Text - Facilitated by a WiFi (or 3G) connection to Google, it is possible to - using the base Google touch keyboard - literally talk text into your phone. This is not a gimmick, the accuracy is quite good and the tracking is fast, I impress people daily about how well thought out and QUICK my text replies are. Absolutely an awesome feature.Battery Life - Awesome! If the phone remains in \"sleep mode\" (screen off) I have seen this battery last for over a week if not used much beyond simple calls and texts. Additionally, with web browsing and hours of GameBoy Advance emulators compounding to roughly 3 hours of screen on and processing power, I charge this phone roughly once every three days. This is quite good, and my HP Pavilion 14\" laptop has worse battery retention when performing the same web browsing intensity.Verizon's network - I have no other option in the area. AT+T gets calls dropped often, Sprint and T-Mobile has 1 / 0 bar service places and I've not seen people attempt other minor carriers. With Verizon around where I live I get a solid 2-3 bars most of the time, and I have not experienced a single dropped call/poor quality anywhere within a 70 mile radius.Cons:1 GB of RAM is eaten up by multiple processes quickly. If you are a power user like me you WILL have to do some memory management - my 360 Mobile Safe Antivirus/Memory management app tells me that the system uses 40% of this all the time, and it doesn't take much to fill up the remaining 600MB of System RAM. Luckily, Google gives you some powerful memory management capabilities built in, but the mentioned 360 Mobile Safe App (that is free) has a one-button memory dump, which is quite nice.No Micro-SD card slot - Definite con. You can remedy the lack of Flash Storage with cloud storage, but this isn't ideal, and was enough of a problem to drop the phone down one star.3G only - You can't get hyperspeed on this phone, unfortunately. Sorry guys, you can't host this phone as a mobile hotspot AND get better download speeds you get on a home WiFi... Why would you want to anyway? 3G is plenty fast for streaming Pandora, watching Youtube videos and Browsing the Web.

Amazing Phone...Wish I couldve used it!!!", "Author": "TGon9505", "ReviewID": "R3LOEV5Q5OIKGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really did my research on this phone and was very excited about the purchase I made from Amazon! Unfortunately, the very next day when I received my phone, thats when the nightmare started. The phone looked brand new and sealed in the packaging just like you would purchase from the store. For example, I literally had to use scissors to cut the packing to even get to the provided books and then had to cut through a complete different package to even touch the phone.I went through the proper procedures of activating the phone and purchasing a bundle plan for use.  Once the phone was completely done programming the customer service rep tells me to make a call and an error message stated the \"PHONE CAN NOT BE AUTHENTICATED\" This happened on February 27th and today is March 3, 2014 AND I JUST LEARNED I HAVE TO RETURN THE PHONE TO AMAZON!!Tthis review is just for \"Customer Beware\" purposes only!! Both Amazon and Verizon Wireless had excellent customer service and tried very hard to fix all issues.HERES THE CRAZY PART!!! I LEARNED TONIGHT THAT THE PHONE I PURCHASED HAD ACTUALLY BEEN HACKED INTO AND WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO USE!! Granted, I was upset after almost a week of late nights with verizon reps..it was getting old trying a million things repeatedly to try and fix the phone...but tonight the verizon rep told me straight up \"Maam you need to return this phone, somebody has hacked this phone and resold on whatever site you bought it from\"! I was shocked, I told him exactly how the packaging was and literally argued with him because I thought he was nuts.  But he was just telling me the truth and even promised a full bundle will be applied to the new phone when I get it. When I contacted Amazon they were just as amazing! They refunded my money and sent me a shipping label for an easy return!!I always shop online and this is the first time anything crazy has happened....but worth mentioning for customers to know!!!", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love my new phone", "Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "RHRLN54SJ18A8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Still learning how to use this phone as I was a hold out with the flip style, but must say this phone has everything I wanted, nice camera, great video, fast, love it!", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great design and phone", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R1ZL9TC6LY7AU6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Motorola Moto G is one of the TOP Phones as of 2014 beginning. I was definiely disappointed with Google selling it off to Lenova. The phone is awesome and I used for few days with my friend. The battery with all of the speech recongition is great as it has two chips.  This is really the next generation in user interface. The specs in a nutshell are:Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)In my opinion, these are key specs to consider. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don\u2019t advertize or mention SAR prominently.Some of the other competing phones in this segment are follows and use them if you are shopping around!Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version):  5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)HTC One: 5.41 x 2.69 x 0.37 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.7 in, 469 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 4 MP/2.1MP, Qualcomm APQ8064T Snapdragon 600, Quad-core 1.7 GHz Krait 300, 0.66 W/kg (head), 0.40 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP,  Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU  Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "S.

I have to think about this, is it worth getting it or not?  You can post comments down below.  After I buy it, I will be reposting an update for this soon.

The only OK things about this phone are the Kit Kat update, picture & video quality, and camera flash. Other than that I can give you potential buyers 2 reasons NOT buy this phone: 1) No SD card slot (i thought I could do without, but I can't ); 2) no mobile hotspot. My LG Optimus Exceed can be used as a Hotspot (Verizon just enabled this capability) and so can the low end LG Optimus Zone 2 (on verizon's website for 49.99).  I knew not to expect much considering the price, but the Zone 2 is half the price of this phone with more capabilities. Too bad I can't send it back.
