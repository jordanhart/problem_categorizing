{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent mid-range phone for the masses when the price is right", "Author": "jamesr", "ReviewID": "R2XY5ME842C72U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently purchased this phone on cricket service during a sale, then proceeded to do a lot of research on it. I salute ZTE and cricket for offering a new mid-range handset that subjectively provides a higher-end experience.Summary: Especially if you find this phone on sale it's an excellent bargain and feels like a quality android experience. The screen is good enough so that you won't be feeling cramped or dealing with slow-refresh times that some cheaper LCDs have. The battery is the best you'll get - it's the new generation chip at 28nm so it bests high-end phones from just a few years ago in many ways. The 1.2ghz dual-core CPU performs smartphone tasks (including web-browsing) as fast as any phone will.If i had to say one thing I did not like, it would be the (sadly commonplace) omission of a tie-point for a lanyard to the phone to make it safer to hold while active. But that's a personal gripe.In depth:Positives: +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The screen resolution might \"only\" be 854x480, but the size of the pixels and display means this dot pitch is actually very well suited to a smartphone. The pixels are just on the edge of visibility; it's not a retina screen, but that actually saves you power so I like this resolution a lot.. plenty \"hi-res\" enough to feel like a quality display. The display also uses IPS technology, so the colors are good, blacks are deep, and refresh times are very good - animations don't flicker, netflix looks great.To me, the device is thinner than it looks in the pictures. With a case it will be thicker of course, but the thing feels good in the hand, and not too big for a pocket.The 1.2 ghz dual processor is qualcomm's latest, the MSM8930, so it's as power efficient, with as modern a feature set as you can get in terms of standards. Being a moderate smart phone user, it's a *huge* performance increase from my last budget android i purchased three years ago.The video card, the Adreno 305, is plenty fast for smooth transitions and netflix, even pretty good with gaming. The chipset supports a resolution up to about 960x500 so it's actually driving a smaller screen that it was made for and that means a faster experience. In fact, the 305 is architecturally identical to the Samsung Galaxy flagships' Adreno 320 in standards and speed; it's just that the Adreno 305 in this phone sports one core, while the higher end 320 has four of them.... and four would definitely be overkill for the resolution the ZTE Source handset has. Dont feel like i'm missing out.The camera has autofocus and works about as you'd expect from a cell phone - not superior but good enough.The micro usb port is on the side so you can use the phone with a stand in portrait mode.The battery life is exceptional - it really does last a whole day, even if you check it constantly. The Qualcomm CPU really shines here; it's best-in-class beating many high-end phones from just a few years ago.The speaker is quite loud and clear and microphone picks up quiet sounds accurately.In general, it's a very solid mid-range experience which would be \"high-end\" for anyone who is currently using a budget or previous years's mid-range phone.(somewhat) Negatives: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------The 1GB of memory, while much better than 512MB, still means you can only have a few apps open at once. Something like 220MB of that is dedicated to the video card.The high-res camera does not capture 30 frame HD video - it must be 24 frames or something (or less?). The front camera (1.3 mpx) records at 30 frames, so video chats are good.Lack of a tie-point for a lanyard means you can't easily secure the phone when you use it during activities. Seems lots of phone makers enjoy the idea of phones breaking -- wink winkNot good or bad: ==========================================================The phone storage has only 2GB free (for the use of the user's content) which would be too small, but that ZTE wisely allows you to move many apps to the SD card (some manufacturers like Samsung do NOT) - and with 32GB cards running 30$ or less, there's really no reason to feel cramped for space. Lots of songs, pictures, apps fit into that 34GB space.The \"mifavor\" user interface ZTE included is a stylistic choice favoring a \"bright\" layout and that may or may not be your thing. Unlike the launcher, which can be changed easy enough, it seems you're stuck with a white-backgroud phone interface when you make calls. it's not bad, but it's different from stock android.Like all phones using this Qualcomm chip (again, the MSM8930), it has single-channel RAM configuration so specific high-bandwidth applications (like video gaming or video recording) won't be as responsive as a dual-channel configuration in phones that cost hundreds more... but i also presume having the single channel saves power versus dual-channel, so to me, it's a wash. This explains the lack of true 30 fps HD video recording since dual-channel is effectively twice as fast... but that only matters if an app actually needs it. The system launcher and netflix and texting etc... do not care. Bandwidth you have but don't use is just waste!)", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "great value", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "RXM4H82IOEKZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great phone, highly recommended. fast, smooth, decent camera. has a good size of 4.5 inches. screen resolution could be a little better though.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "The phone dropped dead on me one month after purchase", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R2U1XHHNIXXKQ5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1Out of nowhere the phone just dropped dead on me.  There was zero damage to it.  Physical or liquid.  It just decided to stop working.  i purchased it through cricket's website. When I called their customer service number which is probably in India I had a very hard time communicating with them.  I found them unhelpful and lacking in information they could tell me.  1I eventually asked if I could return the phone.  They told me no even though I was calling one month to the day that I purchased the phone.  If you don't count the days it took to ship to me, I had the phone for less than a month.  I pretty much thought I was up s***'s creek without a paddle so I had them activate my old Cricket cell phone.The woman told me there would be a $15 activation fee.  For my inconvenience I asked if it could be waived.  She wouldn't waive it.  This discussion went on for another 15 minutes and I go absolutely no where with them.  I even told them if they couldn't solve my issue I would be taking my business elsewhere.  The call center supervisor was fine with this.I called back a few minutes later and selected a different option on the automated system and got in touch with a woman who did activate the phone for me for no charge.  After all, it's not my fault Cricket sold me a defective product.  I asked this woman if I could return my Source.  She also told me no but suggested I call the manufacturer.  So I did.When I got in touch with ZTE the man told me it could just be my battery.  How useful!!!!!!!! Why did no one at Cricket tell me this?  Maybe if they did I wouldn't have activated my old phone and just gone to the Cricket store in the first place.Another thing with the Cricket store.  There are NUMEROUS in my city but the only one's that will handle issues relating to products purchased online are the corporate owned stores.  To find out which store was corporate owned I had to call random stores and ask the person on the phone if he knew which one was corporate owned.  Thankfully he did because Cricket does not seem to share this information.  Another issue with the corporate stores is that they're not listed on google maps.  It's almost as if they don't want you to find them.  When you click to get directions google will literally not register the address.  I have no idea if this is a google maps issue or a Cricket issue but there were too many hurdles to jump through to actually step foot into the store to begin with.Once i got to the store the assistant manager was extremely helpful and told me I'd have a replaced phone in 2 days.  It wasn't the battery.  The screen just wouldn't turn on for reasons unknown.  Hopefully picking up the replacement will be an easy process without any hurdles to jump over.Now onto the phone.  I was really happy with the phone, the speed of it, the size of the screen and the quality of it.  The back of the exterior seems to be made of a very thin cheap piece of plastic.  To prevent this from ever becoming an issue I bought a case.  Inconveniently the case did not allow for an aux jack to fit into the headphone jack completely.  So I had to take a knife and cut out around the space so the cable could completely fit in.  This is one thing in my journey with this phone that I do not hold Cricket accountable for.What I am extremely dissatisfied with was the fact that the phone dropped dead on me after one month.  Up until that point, I was happy with the phone.  Their customer service call center is TERRIBLE.  Next time I have an issue with them I will just head to the corporate owned store.  On a side note I've used Cricket wireless for around 4 years and never had a problem with aphone, their coverage, my billing or anything substantial.  This was the first time.I really was very ready to take my business elsewhere.  Hopefully someone in their company will read this.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00G4HTPKE"}}
