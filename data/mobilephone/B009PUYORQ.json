Calling for support, I was told to remove the battery and that it would need repair. When I received the phone back in the mail, there were no details about the repair and no instructions. Now, the phone had to be reactivated, but that process failed even though I tried numerous times. Unbeknownst to me, the motherboard was replaced in the phone and the device now had a new MEID/serial number, which was not in the . Six months later, the company still has not gotten around to putting that new number in their network database so that I can activate it.I wasted $300 on HTC for a phone that has no possibility of ever working again because of a technicality in their limited warranty repair service. HTC handed off this disaster to me with the claim that they took care of their responsibility to the buyer under warranty -- though, obviously their policy of repair with new MEID is responsible.This is not a one-time thing or a rant from me, one unsatisfied customer. Numerous of their CSRs have told me this is a very common problem they get phone calls about every day. They refuse to send me a phone which can be activated right away.Thus, I will never, ever buy another HTC phone (for instance, I had to buy yet another phone to be able to have service again and though an HTC phone was at a lower sales price, I chose to get a Samsung instead of throwing my money away with HTC). I would never and will never recommend an HTC phone simply based on my experience with their customer service, which was of no service whatsoever.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Vicki", "ReviewID": "R1ODPEFYDMFR8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son had a phone like this and when I saw it came in purple I had to have it.
