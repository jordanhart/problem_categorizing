You can perform gestures such as sliding pictures or scaling them with two fingers.- Nice interface: the rotating cube is great. The contact manager is as good as it gets, I loved it.- Wonderful screen resolution: 480x800- Good looking and not bulky at all, especially for that resolution.- Great multimedia features: decent camera, video with sound, 8GB, nice music player.- Good battery life when used as a music player: I had this phone playing music for hours in a party with no need for a charger.Cons:- Average battery life with day to day use.- Slow: Browsing is embarrassingly slow. I thought that was normal for a cell phone until I saw some other phones browsing way faster, even phones worth half the price. Navigation is fast 90% of the time but occasionally it'll freeze for a few seconds. Same thing with the accelerometer, sometimes it just doesn't realize it has to rotate the screen.- Interface mistakes: regardless of the great looks, it has some obvious mistakes. For example, when you make a call it locks the screen, so far so good. But sometimes you need to unlock the phone (to dial an extension number for example) and guess what, as soon as you click the unlock button on the highly sensitive screen there's a red \"hang up\" button just below it waiting for you to click it by mistake.Also, IMHO the \"call\" button on the phone should open the dial-pad and the one on the screen the \"recent calls list\", not the other way around.- Kind of fragile: I've had Nokias fall harder with no problems whatsoever.Well, that pretty much summarizes it, I hope you find my review useful.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Review Arena", "Author": "Roger \"Roger\"", "ReviewID": "R7KXTFTKREMVW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this Arena via Amazon.com (MobileCityOnline) and connected it to my desktop to synchronize it. LG PC Suite III asked me if I would like to update my Arena, which I did.After this been done I could not use this phone anymore and having VERSION MISMATCHING in the phone display.Amazon as well as MobileCityOnline refusing to have it flash resetted, as this phone is an international one and can only be resetted outside the States. I paid 520,00 US for this phone and still can not use it. I feel robbed. DO NOT BUY THIS ARENA FROM AMAZON!

Nice when it worked, but the software problems made this thing a P.O.S.. Could not send photos via email when using the 5MP camera.  Not enough memory to send it.  I had to downsize to 3MP. Would not fetch mail at the intervals I had put in.  It tried and locked up.  LG did not think this software through.  Allot of money for bad software.  Sent it back to mobilecity and got hit with a 15% restocking fee even though the phone was defective.

So I like this phone and I wouldn't trade it in for any other (at the moment) but that's just me. It comes with it's fair share of problems though. One key problem is that when i'm on the net, say checking my mail, if i choose to save the password (prompt from phone) and then try to sign into the same mail service with a different username and password the phone restarts. To avoid this (I've learnt all by my lonesome) You have to either clear the cache (or turn it off completely) each time you want to use a different sign-in for the same email service...OR opt not to save the password each time you put one in and are prompted to chose whether or not to do so. There are other little probs but I really don't care as I said I like it despite. The good stuff can be found all over the net and some more of the other trivial pitfalls of this model", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buggy", "Author": "PStreet", "ReviewID": "RZP0I2LV1785X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am in the US. This product is really intended for the UK or Ausi. Theoretically, this should not be an issue, however I have learned that the carriers will not support you at all if you do not use one of their branded models. I have also learned that LG will not support you at all on this model if you are in North America. Luckily there is the internet - coupled with many hours of surfing, I was able to get this phone to limp along on T-Mo.I was never able to get the settings to get the 3G to work, however the T-Mo edge network is fast enough in my area, so I am happy with that.I got a great buy of $175 from a Chinese distributor and received it in a week, however the firmware was way down rev. As I said before, there was no support, so I had to figure out how to do it over the web, this took way too many hours but I am now running the latest firmware.The phone is still sluggish - it takes getting used to, but many phones in this price category are sluggish.This phone is still buggy. There are many ways to lock it up which then requires you to remove the battery to get it to restart. It seems to happen for a few days in a row, and then it will work fine for 1-2 weeks.I am getting annoyed with it, but not enough to give up on it because it does have a lot of great features.My advice is that you should never buy a phone that is not supported through your carrier.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excelente, pero no perfecto", "Author": "Juan Ortiz Guti\u00e9rrez", "ReviewID": "R3BXP6J7YBGU09", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "El celular es muy bueno, es verdad que de f\u00e1brica presenta problemas con el software y tiende a trabarse, pero cambiandole el firmware se arregla, lo del gps no me interesa porque yo no lo necesito, en cuanto a funcionalidad me parece excelente, buena pantalla que responde AL TACTO Y NO A LA PRESI\u00d3N, excelente c\u00e1mara y wi-fi con r\u00e1pida conexi\u00f3n, yo me siento satisfecho con \u00e9l, aunque siendo sinceros el windows mobile lo hubiera hecho perfecto...por lo dem\u00e1s me parece una buena opci\u00f3n de compra", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "I do not recommend", "Author": "Armando", "ReviewID": "R36DNP37PDZB3B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "overall the phone is great but the firmware is very limited to the specific characteristics of Vodafone making it incompatible for many connecting services to other operators. the wifi is slow and unstable.
