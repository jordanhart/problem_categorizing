Erica Griffin) on YouTube for THE quintessential, in-depth review!!! (She does other phone reviews, too!): www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDqyYgBm7YPersonally, the Android system/compatibility suits me best and the quality is outstanding! I also needed a way to transfer files from SD cards to an external hard drive AND access files on drives, but I didn't want to use my computer (and batteries, cables, etc.) to reduce bulk and weight in my travel luggage. The answer was to ROOT the phone! Here, I would strongly advise researching the PROPER procedure for your phone/system version! If you have the right procedure, it's FAST and above all, SAFE!!", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as great as Hype but nice", "Author": "Michael Cross", "ReviewID": "R2QZUMA3LHU3BM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sound sucks.

The biggest problem with the 4S smart phone is trying to understand the Samsung model numbers, as I was only able to locate two model numbers (GTi9500 and GTi9505). However, when sold to specific wireless providers then there is an abundance of different model numbers and adds more complexity understanding model numbers.My goal was to purchase a GSM \"unlocked\" 4S with 4G capabilities, but there is confusion about what model of Galaxy 4S supports 4G capabilities, as some models only support international versions. I still don't know which model is for international and domestic, nor do I know what model supports 4G. I purchased the GTi9500 and it didn't support 4G, as a matter of fact the best I could connect was HSPA+, which is somewhere between 3G and 4G (I think).The 4S does have some positive notes: the screen is stunning, very vibrant, clear and big (the size of this smart phone is somewhere between a smart phone and a tablet). So this smart phone could be called a \"Stablet\"? Photos and videos are awesome. However, the S4 still lacks the ability of playing mp4 video as it wouldn't play any of my mp4 videos.Battery performance is better as the OS is managing power more efficiently. Although, there are times with the OS seems to hang or freeze for a few seconds, as I think the OS resources are prioritized to the stunning screen.If you are in the market to purchase a 4S unlocked GSM smart phone, the Samsung Galaxy S4 is not the phone you want to pursue, as the model numbers are too vague to understand what features or speciation's. Perhaps a Galaxy S3 is the better choice when it comes to 4G capabilities.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CIVY75S"}}
