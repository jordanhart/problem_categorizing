It works fine and do not have any problems with it. It is no thrills but works. It is a get me by phone until I get something better.

Both units looked very good, but while one worked like new, the other had some intermittent operating issues.

The replacement phone arrived the next day, along with a prepaid mailer to return the unit with the intermittent problems.

This phone lasts 2 weeks on stand by!!!!!2. Water will not stop this phone!I have had this phone for 3-4 yrs every night in my humid bathroom showers before I was informed by Customer Service Representative, that I probably should not be doing that. Humidity is the same as dipping the phone in water, I guess? well, ah, I did that too... : / ah.. ahem.The phone has fallen in the child's bathtub and the little purse belt clip would get soaked before I realize it to remove the phone from the soaking wet purse. This phone is amazing! I have never DL games, APPS, or Music tones, but I believe they are available, I just do not know what website to visit to obtain such things? My one half complaint, is that I have trouble working the Blue Tooth (My phone has blue tooth, I do not see this listed here for some reason\u00bf?) but the trouble could be user error or the fact that the phone was consistently next to the shower with me every night for three years. I have Never operated Blue tooth functions in my life, and I'm not even sure I have the correct password. (This:  depends on your talk/data plan with verizon,) .. but My phone has no memory card to remove photos, they must be upload to Verizon Pix Place at 25 cents per photo or txt pic to a friend to email back to your PC. Other that Blue Tooth, I could not see a way to get the photos off my camera phone. It seems to have pretty good memory for the price! I have over 560 photos on my phone with more memory available. My phone is not capable of carrying MP3s, however, I am sure Zune is available \"live\" via the web browser, just can not DL the songs due to the somewhat less than stellar memory size.Recently, I even accidentally left the phone out in the rain. Literally. rain. I knew it was going to rain that night. I dropped the phone! Eek! I searched and searched! I could not find the phone in the dark, as it was still  in \"standalone mode\" for movies, church and stuff. plus it is always on Vibrate. In the morning dew/rain (I am pretty sure it did rain as predicted). There was the phone! The screen even lit up for me when I opened the phone! Wow!Finally, I am upgrading now to a new phone for a better camera.I love this phone though! I really do! Wallpaper on main screen and front is not static. It is set by the user. I like this phone! It's simple, yet I always find some interesting new function hiding somewhere on the list. Such as \"add... graphic\" of small cute yellow smiley face, or even animation to boring txts. My friend sat on  and broke his smart phone. I can't help but ask \"How smart is your 'Smart Phone' now, mister?\"  : )  no, really, I had two friends that had to repair smart phone and i phone, (the iphone actually places random calls when in my friend's pocket! ! Really!! really!!!) I never did trust those touch screens. I have crushed my LG phone by laying down, my hip, my entire body weight on my friend's carpet more than once. It keeps functioning just fine. This makes me very nervous to buy a new phone! Why would I give up such an amazing phone???????? I've held on to this phone for 3 years! I love this phone! What if my next phone is not this wonderful?My plan was pay-as-you go, with $1 per all day internet access (only on days you use it), $1 talk all day verizon to verizon, and ten cents per text message (without incurring the $1 daily use activation fee). $15 was sufficient for my texting needs. (including many 25 photo text messages, my favorite fun...).I believe the SAR rating was like 1.2 ....  for my phone, .. this Amazon phone (although same model number as under my battery) may be some version of upgrade. I don't see the blue tooth function listed. My phone even has voice recognition Command \"call ____\" function. I have not used this, but it seems wonderful. I've seen my friend use this with his Iphone over the car speakers. Yes, I have the same technology on my phone. Blue tooth???....Anyway, That's pretty neat, from 4 yrs ago, technology.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returned Items", "Author": "Bernie", "ReviewID": "R10FWVP2DCMY11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I orderd 3 phones.
