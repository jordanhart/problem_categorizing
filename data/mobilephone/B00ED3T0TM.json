{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love the phone but NOT 4GLTE compatible!", "Author": "M. Turner \"PhoenixFireDesigns .com\"", "ReviewID": "R2TFZZ4IOUIYZB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I did not realize there are TWO versions of the Galaxy S4: the I9500 and the I9505. The I9500 features the Exynos Octa core (8 processors) which has better benchmarks and the I9505 features the quad core (4 processors) Snapdragon 600. Problem is that the I9500 version is NOT LTE enabled.Regardless of whether or not you buy it as the \"international\" version or not, if you get the I9500 version, it maxes out at HSPA+ speeds (which is marketed as \"4G\" on some carriers like T-Mobile but is NOT to be confused with 4G LTE which is faster.) You can see specifics in Wikipedia: [...]I love everything about the phone. The blue color is beautiful. I had no problems getting a MetroPCS (owned by T-Mobile) SIM and running it on their 3G/HSPA+ networks. It's a GSM device so I could also bring it to AT&T; if I wanted. The 5\" screen is gorgeous and it's truly an awesome device. It was unlocked, unbranded and official as listed.But all that said, I'm really frustrated because I did not know this or find this out until after my 30 day return period had passed. And when you spend $550 for a phone, you want to get the most out of it which includes the fastest speed possible for the longest amount of time.So head's up to those wanting an unlocked/unbranded S4. Make sure the device is the one you want: I9500 for the better processor but no LTE or I9505 for slower processor but faster LTE service.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone, beautiful color!", "Author": "Kev.j.a", "ReviewID": "R2CO1LBBQXFXI9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is a great piece of technology! and delivery was speedy.

I had purchased online, so it was international i9500. Battery bulged and had standard issue that is widely reported in the press. I called Samsung USA. They refuse to change the battery and say that it is international. The phone is British EU based. I checked with IMEI number also. Samsung US claims the phone is from Syria! and refuse to replace the battery. Well that's it for customer Service. So warning that the international phones have no warranty!UPDATE: 10/8/2013:An updated NFC Tag from Whiztags is just awesome, has 450 bytes of memory and I use several of those in office and home with my Samsung Galaxy S4 NFC tags - Topaz 512 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writeable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 3 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee!I have been using TechMatteTM Qi-compatible Wireless Charger for the Nexus 4, HTC 8X, HTC Droid DNA, Nokia Lumia 920, LG Optimus Vu2 (With AC Adapter and Micro USB Cable). and TechMatteTM Qi-standard Wireless Charger Receiver Coil for SAMSUNG Galaxy S4 SIV for wireless charging and they are very convenient for charging by placing on the mat.UPDATE 9/15/2013:I thought I will update since it's been a while. We have two Galaxy S4 in the family. One black and one white both unlocked. There has been few firmware updates to the 9500 International series. I have been asked about the heat issue. Other than normal electronic heating feeling, it does NOT get super hot etc. In the initial days some people had issues, but apparently firmware has patched it. Version 4.2.2, BUILD: JDQ39.I9500XXUAMDX. Kernel 3.4.5-526212. I use Battery Widget Pro and has been watching battery usage. Easily for a day with normal usage. If I use video streaming and use NAVIGON indiscriminately, of course battery usage will shot down. Camera app does crash with latest updates. If I don't use camera for a day and use it, sometimes it crashes and phone reboots. After that no issue in subsequent sessions.  I have been using NFC a lot. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with  NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.Get a spare battery if you are using phone in an intense manner or if you are on long road trips or for just peace of mind. Timetec 2*2600mAh High Capacity Li-ion Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 S IV SIV, I9500. Samsung Galaxy GT-I9500, Verizon SCH-I545, AT&T; SGH-I337, Sprint SPH-L720+Free Bonus TimeTecTM Multi-purpose USB Travel Charger is a great choice.Another great gadget to have in your backpack while traveling or at home is an excellen remote for this phone. Yes a remote for media and camera. I have reviewed it at Satechi BT MediaRemote Bluetooth Multi-Media Remote Control (White) for Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, S4 / Note, Note II / Galaxy Tab / Galaxy NexusORIGINAL REVIEWGalaxy S4 is an incredible phone. I have been using this unlocked S4 for past 2 days helping a friend to migrate from iPhone 4S. My friend has been on iPhone and it also gave me a unique perspective. I used iPhone for couple of years and been using Android for past 3+ years.I have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvTriggerGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4.

I got sick of getting the run-a-round from all of the service providers and their tricky ways of hiding the costs of the phone.  In a fit of pique one night, I came to Amazon to order one without strings.  It arrived within two days and was immediately put into service.  I did not think our carrier would insure the phone, but since it was new, they agreed to fully insure it, even though it was not purchased through them.  The fact that I have purchased dozens of phones for my company from them had absolutely nothing to do with their willingness to accommodate me, I'm sure.NOTICE: This phone will not work on Verizon. Sprint will tell you they can't authorize this phone, but ask for a supervisor.  Most of the CSRs just don't know how to program it for Sprint.The features of the phone are as described in the listing literature.  It's pretty much everything you'd expect in a phone (we moved from iPhones), but the Android OS takes a little getting used to.  It figures, right after purchasing this phone, Samsung announced that the S4 will arrive in April, and it has the nifty finger-print unlock system, a MUCH better camera, and some other goodies.  Unfortunately, Samsung still hangs onto the plastic cases and backs.  Maybe someday we'll get a titanium frame to help protect it.  Otter has some stylish new cases for these phones, so I'd advise getting one. Since the user is not going to tax the phone's capabilities anyway, it should work fine.  THE ONLY PROBLEM WE HAVE HAD IS THAT THIS PHONE WILL NOT \"GET BARS\" IN THE EXACT SAME LOCATIONS AS MY SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 3.  If we can't resolve the problem, I guess I will be testing return service through Amazon.One other drawback (for me) is that, as much as I hated the iTunes interface and the limitations Apple imposes, the neither the Galaxy nor the Note have comparable music players that do not require a paid subscription to some music service.  With the optional SD card, there should be plenty of room for music, and I'm pretty certain I'll be able to find an Android music player somewhere.  If you know of one, please post it in the comments.A very unexpected surprise is that both phones will run 3-5 days without a recharge.  On the Note, the standard USB3 connector allows the flexibility of external power packs, but it doesn't look like one will be necessary.If this site lets me, I'll post further information later.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Nickeshia", "ReviewID": "RSEKC30X4DA4H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it the but it hot it thin its amazing phone........... its the best phone i ever had  just love it", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Hector", "ReviewID": "R2KK3B6ZK32WMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone, the color is very nice and works perfectly with any mobile telephony, is great, thank you very much!", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's beautiful the price is ok, but the phone stopped working all the time.", "Author": "Szabina Bakos", "ReviewID": "R3CSBSL62RBHYH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was so excited to have this phone in beautiful blue color. Actually, it started to 'freeze' on the first day and many times (2-3 daily) I couln't even turn it off (so I had to remove the battery). I couldn't afford a phone what I cannot trust in 100%, so I decided to return it in my 30 days. Now I had to buy a black one from an other company, it works perfectly -1 week experience with the same AT&T; Sim. I feel so sorry bc of the color.
