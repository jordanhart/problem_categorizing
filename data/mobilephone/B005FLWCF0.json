Love it.  Thought I'd try to find another to use as a spare, but they no longer make the Rock.  I searched and searched for the Boulder, which is the replacement for the Rock, and finally found one. You have to be very careful about buying cell phones on the internet because there are retailers who claim to be selling new products, but often they arrive without batteries, backs, chargers, etc.  The Rock will always be my favorite because it is indestructible (went through the wash once with no problems).  The Boulder has less rubber and may be not as tough, but it works just fine, holds a charge for quite a while and I have no complaints.  You won't find any of these fine Casio phones at Verizon, so if you want one--and you should--try this retailer.  You can't beat the price ($79.) plus a few more bucks for the chargers.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its tough but not invincible", "Author": "kyle", "ReviewID": "R3IOS5B9RMNATW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "amazing phone if you want just that a phone that is tough its good for calling and texting that's about it.
