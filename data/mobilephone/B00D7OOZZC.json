Since, I was not looking to spend too much, happy with what I got. Handset fits hand nicely compared to other big phones.OS is great too. I like customizing tiles for her based on her usage. All essential apps were available for free..Only negatives could be about Camera not having flash and the screen display is not as great as other Lumias. however, I didn't spend to get everything either.", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone Worked very well", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2P47ZBBCUJC6R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone for my mother to use on straight talk. I knew that just getting an AT&T; locked phone would have been fine (and cheaper) but I figured if we were spending the money on a non-contract phone we might as well get something we can take to other carriers. We haven't had the chance to take it to another carrier so I can not guarantee that it is unlocked or not. You should be aware though that the model I received was AT&T; branded with a tether lock so even on straight talk, if we tried to tether it, it would give an error and direct us to an AT&T; page.Now for the general overview of the device, we love it!The Camera is not the best, but it is certainly not the worst. I have seen some phones that have 8MP cameras with flash that was only slight better than this one. In daylight, this camera will work great and give you suitable shots for a phone. At night, it has the capability of shooting at an iso of 800 and has a night-mode though I am not quite sure what that does yet. Photo Albums on the device are excellent and pull in photos from multiple sources and you can view them just like you took the photos on the phone.The Phone quality is pretty good for a cell phone and I have not had much to say about it. Speaker phone works pretty well alsoThe Web browser on the device leaves some things to be desired in comparison to the browser on Android. For example, the speed of browsing on this phone feels slower than a comparable Android phone. You also can not really change to a different browser. Sure you can download another browser app, but that is really just Internet Explorer wrapped in a different container.Music on the phone is decent, I just wish it allowed for more enhancements. In the Audio enhancement settings, the only thing it gives you is \"Flip to silence\". However, if you don't have much of a budget than you will find the Xbox Music Subscription to be heavily desired because it gives you a huge library of music that you can download for only $10 a month or $100 a year. With the way I listen to music, I could go through that $100 in about 3 months by purchasing music. I will take some loss of rights for a deal that good.GPS and Navigation is also decent, it isn't Google maps, but it gets you around and it does allow you to download the maps for your entire state (or more states if desired) so that you can continue to use the maps and navigation even when you have no data connection. If you are out of the United States it also has maps for most roads in the world in whatever country you are driving in.The largest issue I have with this phone is App Support. Windows Phone could be amazing if they only had more Applications. I know this is no fault of Nokia but considered that the applications is a big reason that somebody would buy a smartphone, I feel the need to comment on it. You have all the basic applications but don't try looking for anything special.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "like it", "Author": "kieon nicholas", "ReviewID": "R1Z9HMBWNNV3TG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i just like it wish i could change the background into different colour that the only thing that missing in the phone beside that i like", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "phone is defective don't buy it", "Author": "mayada", "ReviewID": "R2D35BF9FZ0IIB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the product is defective. it's not working properly.
