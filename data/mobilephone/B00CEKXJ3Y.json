{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Blows the competition out of the water!", "Author": "MOAR COARS", "ReviewID": "R310TOEUT190WV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE#1: The battery life seems great, better than on the S3 even though the screen is larger and has a higher resolution than the S3. When I had my S3, I used to lose about ~3-5% of battery every two hours or so but with the S4, I seem to lose about ~1-2% so that's awesome. The phone comes with a ton of bloatware and the only way to get a good battery is by removing all the bloatware. I was getting terrible battery life when I first got my phone but after reading online it seems that everyone suggests removing the bloatware for batter battery life. Like I said in my review, the snapdragon 600 uses very little battery when it is not being used so that's a big plus. I'm a heavy user and when I say heavy user, I mean heavy user. I do pretty much everything on my phone from taking a crapload of pictures/videos, watching YouTube videos, playing 3D games, phone calls and surfing the internet. At the end of the day the phone has about 30-35% of juice left. Also, one thing that I forgot to mention was the speakers on the phone. Samsung decided to move the speakers which used to be at the top near the camera on the S3 to the bottom of the phone which wasn't a good idea if you ask me. You can block the sound coming from the phone when holding the phone with your hand.----------------------It's been a week since I got my Galaxy S4 and this thing is super awesome. My previous phone was the S3 which I loved to death and this time I'm super excited to have the S4 in my hands. I had absolutely zero issues with the S3 but the S4 looks so sexy with the metal edges. I seriously don't understand why people buy an iPhone because let me tell you that the Galaxy S4 blows the iPhone 5 out of the water and every other phone out there. The Galaxy S4 wins hands down in every category compared to the iPhone 5. I was blown away by the performance of this phone. The Snapdragon 600 is blazing fast and uses far less battery than the S3. I can get through the day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. I'm a heavy user so this says a lot about the phone. Even my family who loves the iPhone is blown away by this phone. My family just loves the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iPhone 5. There are many reasons why I decided to go with this phone over the other smartphones on the market but the main reason is the screen size, camera, storage, processor and the battery life.These are some of the things that the Galaxy S4 has over the iPhone 5 and other high end phones:Pros:-Screen: The Galaxy S4 has a nice 5 inches Super AMOLED HD screen that makes everything stand out when viewing it. The resolution on this phone is a nice 1080 x 1920 (441ppi pixel density) which makes everything look sharp. The Gorilla Glass 3 is also much better at preventing the screen from cracking and scratching. I tried to scratch the screen with my car keys and nothing happened to the screen, impressive. It has a significantly higher resolution than the iPhone 5 (640 x 1136). Also, the iPhone 5 is only 4 inches which is way too small for most people.-Android OS: This phone ships with the most up to date version of Android, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet. Samsung has added many new features to TouchWiz which is great. I'm not really a fan of TouchWiz but it seems that they have made many improvements to the UI.-Design: The design is sort of the same as the S3 which I have no problems with. The S3's design is sexy and very comfortable to hold in your hand and the same goes for the S4. If you loved the S3's design then you will love the S4's design even more, trust me. The phone feels a little bit lighter and thinner which is great. It has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold the phone.-Camera: The primary camera on this phone is 13MP (4128 x 3096 pixels) and the front camera is 2MP that takes some of the best pictures I have ever seen. The front facing camera is great when you are Skyping or even taking pictures of yourself.-Battery: Samsung has decided to improve the battery capacity in S4 to 2600mAh that can easily last a full day with a single charge. I can get through a day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. The battery life is one of the most important aspects when deciding which phone to buy for me because I travel a lot and I need a phone that can last a full day. My previous phone which was the S3 needed at least 2-3 charges to last through a day. The Snapdragon 600 does an outstanding job at using as little battery as possible.-Storage: With the option of an external sdcard, this phone simply destroys the iPhone 5. I can store as many pictures and HD videos as I want and it will never come close to being full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures, videos, and movies and this phone lets me do all of that easily. I also play 3D games that require a minimum of 1-2GB of space and this phone is perfect for that.-Processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (Quad-core 1.9 GHz Krait 300) does an amazing job at keeping this phone lag free and blazing fast. I have never experienced a slow down with this phone. I have even tested this phone by playing intensive games such GTA Vice City on the highest settings and there were no slowdowns whatsoever. I am very impressed with the processor in this phone.-Removable Battery: Who doesn't love this, seriously? This and the option of an external sdcard make this the best phone of the year. I always carry extra batteries whenever I travel somewhere and I can easily swap my battery with another one when the phone is low on battery. This is a big plus for this phone. Sucks to be an iPhone user!Cons:-None. As much as I want to think of something bad to say, there's simply nothing negative about this phone.Overall, I can safely say that Samsung has another winner in their hands. It's a great phone and it doesn't disappoint. With the amazing 1080p resolution, screen size, battery capacity and storage, this phone puts other phones to shame. The Galaxy S4 will be the best phone of 2013, mark my words!", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Crippled on arrival", "Author": "J. P. Bass \"JPBass2\"", "ReviewID": "RAPLZNW8329VI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone with the highest of hopes.  I had gone through 4 years of the ups and downs of HTC products and was ready for a change of pace.  I did a lot of research and concluded that the Samsung experiences were pretty good.  So when I started to have trouble with this device on the very first day I was more than a little disappointed.  To get down to the facts, the WIFI had issues.  No matter what WIFI I connected to the phone would randomly disconnect and re-connect.  I came to the conclusion that the WIFI was actually turning itself on and off.  I poured over the forums and support sites and started to see that Samsung has a history of WIFI issues going back to the S3.  But most of these issues had resolutions and were not universal to all types of WIFI as was mine.  Everything else about this phone is great and would be greater if I could be on a stable WIFI connection.  I've got a replacement coming now as the guys at Sprint were even shocked at how bad this one was.  Perhaps when the replacement comes I'll update you.  But, watch out for this, if your WIFI is flakey don't put up with it, take it back and get another.Update July 1st, 2013Sprint replaced the device.  It was of note that the failed device was model SPH-L720BKK, the new (or replacement) device was SPH-L720BKX.  The replacement works perfectly so far.  This was the experience I had hoped for with this device.  Happy at last.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone, incremental upgrade from SIII", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R3SUTZO7SQXAWN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Galaxy S4 is  an incredible phone. I have been using this unlocked S4 for past 2 days helping a friend to migrate from iPhone 4S. My friend has been on iPhone and it also gave me a unique perspective. I used iPhone for couple of years and been using Android for past 3+ years.I have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4.

I have Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 and an ASUS TF300 tablet, so the learning curve for this was non-existent for me (which was the contrary for my mother, who upgraded to an HTC One, disliked it and the size and switched to an iPhone *sadface*).The Good:Large Screen - Nice large screen to do whatever you wantSheer Speed - A quad core processor in a phoneSD Card - I bought this to replace both my phone and Mp3 player.  This phone does the trick with a 64GB optional SD card.  I currently have a 32GB in there filled with music.The Neutral:TouchWiz - Most of the additional features that the galaxy offers, like NFC (data exchange for touching devices), S-Beam, Air Gesture, etc I find as gimmicks and are attempted selling points that I never use.  The UI is also familiar to most, but I did what I do with any Android deveice: Install Nova Launcher over it.The Bad:Battery Life (initially) - The first two days I owned the phone, I was unhappy with the battery life.  I would unplug it from the charger at 7:00 AM before I head to work, and by the time I am done with work at 4:00 PM, it would be down to around 35-40%.  I found that Google Services was taking up a lot of battery.  I had to do some digging to fix this, but I disabled all google account syncing except for Contacts and Calendar, since the constant syncing can wake up the device to perform its tasks.  I also disabled Google Maps from automatically updating its location and disabled Google Now.  I also set my email to update less frequently (from 5 minutes (lol) to 30 minutes) and set it to store less emails, thus reducing the time the email app must have a \"wakelock\" to do its business.  In short, it was a few headaches to get the battery life to a satisfactory level for me.Storage Space - 16Gb, of which roughly half of it was taken for Samsung's implementation of Android and TouchWiz.  Slightly annoying...almost as bad as Microsoft taking up half of 64GB for their implementation of Windows 8 Touch.Overall, I love the S4 and am glad I upgraded.  When I got my S4, my mom upgraded to an HTC One, so I had time to compare the two juggernauts of the Android market and I can honestly say, though both have their pros and cons, I love my S4 (All the HTC has going for it are the good camera in dark conditions and the dual audio speakers).", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loaded with crap out of the box, but not bad after some changes", "Author": "D. Alexander", "ReviewID": "R11QX01Z9I47CK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Do you remember that YouTube video showing what an iPod box would look like if it was made by Microsoft? The dozens of stickers and certifications and advertisements? That's what this phone feels like out of the box. It's overwhelmed with Samsung stuff, much of which serves only to drain the battery or change Android for no particular reason. The phone actually lagged and stuttered from the get-go. That's a hell of an achievement for a quad-core handset with 2GB of RAM. Since I came from a Galaxy S running Cyanogen, that just wouldn't do.SPEEDIFYING THE S4:The first step was to gain full control by rooting it. Google 'qbking77 galaxy s4 root' for an easy guide.Step two was to install 'NoBloat Free' and start disabling all the Samsung background nonsense. Search '[ROM]broodROM S4 RC1' and click the first link for a list of what's safe to ditch. Don't permanently delete anything; you'll need to re-enable these later to apply Samsung's over-the-air updates.Step three was to change the animation speed for the UI under Developer Options. To enable Developer Options, go to System Settings -> More -> About Device, scroll down, and tap on build number five or ten times. Then back up, go into Developer Options, and change the three 'X scales' near the bottom from 1X to 0.5X or Off.Step four was to ditch the TouchWiz launcher and use Nova Launcher instead. It's like a pumped-up version of the stock Android launcher and very fast. The free version does everything you'll need.Step five was to disable NFC, S Beam, Bluetooth, and so on. All that stuff is lovely, but leaving it on when you don't need it (Bluetooth in particular) does nasty things to your battery life. If you want idle time measured in days, disable location services in the Maps app. If you get 'Media Server' taking up your battery, install Rescan Media Root.That's it for performance. The phone is fairly quick now. It has about 900 MB of free memory and, if left idle, will sit for about 80 hours before the battery dies. After that, I installed a couple of useful apps like Screen Filter (to dim the screen even more at night), Waze (which has traffic rerouting and police alerts and makes my Garmin feel a million years old), F-Droid (an alternative app store that'll let you install things like AdAway) and so on.Update-- out of annoyance with inconsistent performance even after many of these tweaks, I switched to CyanogenMod 10.1. It's not quite as stable as the stock Samsung firmware, but it's so much faster.BUILD:It's a pretty handset and shockingly thin. It almost disappears even in tight (for a guy) jeans. It's also incredibly slippery. I nearly dropped it twice setting it up. Unlike my Samsung Epic (which had the delightful feature of falling into pieces when dropped and not breaking), you can crack the screen easily, so buy a case. I vowed I wasn't going to bother since the Epic never needed one. I've done a 180. After trying a few, I've been very happy with Spigen's Ultra Fit in high-grip matte black. The phone is much easier to grip now with minimal changes in thickness.Review sites say the HTC One is a prettier fetish object. I agree it feels better in hand, but there's a caveat: it can't be dismantled. If you drop it or mess up the charging port, Sprint can't fix it onsite. They have to send it back to HTC. The HTC is also chunkier, for better or worse.The screen is near-perfect. It'd be totally perfect if not for the high power use displaying white and pleasing, though somewhat inaccurate color. You'll want to use dark or night themes whenever possible. Pixels are invisible. Blacks are pitch even in darkness. The size is just on the border of too large for one-handed use. I'm over six feet with commensurately-sized hands, and pressing the side Power button while bracing with a pinky is a slight stretch. A five-foot friend loves her Note II, though, so if you're willing to treat it two-handed like a tablet, any hand size will do.AS A PHONE:Samsung included a useful app (perish the thought!) called 'Adapt Sound'. It's under System Settings -> My Device -> Sound, at the bottom. It'll test your hearing and change the frequency response of the phone to suit it. The app significantly improved the intelligibility of conversations to me. Much, much better than the Galaxy S.I did have some trouble integrating Google Voice. Sprint has a Visual Voicemail app ('VTT') with a three month trial that kept coming back from the dead and showing me old voicemails. The solution was to press and hold the Voicemail app icon from Nova Launcher and drag it up to 'Manage App' on the top left. Then I pressed 'Disable' and agreed to all the prompts when it asked to uninstall itself. Now the voicemail button in the dialer calls Google Voice. Voicemails are also transcribed and sent to my inbox per usual.TEXT INPUT:This is my first handset without a hardware keyboard. It's been a surprisingly smooth transition to screen typing. Hardware keyboards work really well for idiosyncratic speech and punctuation. If you're sufficiently pedantic to chafe at the thought of accidentally using the wrong quote marks or comma placement, no software keyboard will be a true panacea. But some are better than others.The most clever of them all is SwiftKey. First, because it'll let you seamlessly switch from tapping letters to gesture-style word tracing. Second, because it has the best text prediction, because it scrapes your email, Facebook, text messages, and Twitter to compile a personalized library of what you actually say. That one word you made up that doesn't exist in any dictionary? If you've ever used it anywhere, SwiftKey will predict it. That extends to full sentence constructions.In practice, I use word-tracing in portrait mode and rely on SwiftKey to guess correctly. With just GMail and Facebook in the database, it does so about 90% of the time if my tracing is even vaguely on point. For more unique words, I switch to landscape and use that larger keyboard to accurately touch-type. As SwiftKey learns, I find myself doing this less often. In a car, I rely on Google's voice recognition, which is superb when it works (most of the time), but often requires saying the same thing twice to fix an error six words earlier.All of this is noticeably easier on the S4's 5\" screen than it ever was on the Epic's 4\" screen. My iPhone friends continue to amaze me with their speed and accuracy, but with my large thumbs, I couldn't duplicate that with a screen keyboard on any handset before this one.ACCESSORIES:The 2.1 amp wall charger charges at 1% per minute, so a little under two hours for a full charge. Beware off-brand and car chargers. I discovered the phone charges in one of two modes: USB computer mode and dumb charger mode. USB mode (where it assumes the output device is a computer) only gives 0.5A (to stay within the USB spec), so the phone will take all night to charge. But it'll pull 2 amps or more from a dumb charger if you're not using a super-skinny USB cable.The problem is, there are two ways to make a charger appear 'dumb', and they're incompatible. The Apple way (implemented by most chargers) won't fast-charge this phone. The other way (shorting the two middle USB data pins) will, but few chargers actually use this technique (thanks to Apple's popularity). The upshot is, unless you're buying branded accessories specifically for Android phones, you're probably going to have to do minor surgery on any of the cheaper chargers you buy.SHOULD YOU BUY THIS PHONE?Maybe. The S4 has some impressive hardware and a best-in-class screen, but the phone experience is dictated by Android. And Android is hit or miss.This phone, after I've tweaked the hell out of it, is occasionally faster than an iPhone. More often, it isn't. The iPhone screen lights up faster when you press the power button. There's very little delay after you press an app, and very little more in showing content within the app. The UI animations are smooth.Android is none of these things, and more noticeably, it's not consistent. Sometimes it's very fast, sometimes it lags, and you'll never have any idea why. And then there's the micromanagement. I'm happy that I discovered how to disable the background media scanner that was cutting 30 hours of my idle time, but I shouldn't have to do that.Windows Phone 8 is right up there with the iPhone in responsiveness. Better, even, and with a novel and impressive UI that integrates many social media functions independent of separate apps. The Windows app store is lackluster, though, and the OS itself is harder to hack if that's what you're about. You really have to be happy with how the phone works out of the box. The hardware also lags behind Android handsets, but you won't ever notice (except in some games) because the OS is so fluid. And it has terrific Exchange support for business users.For most people, unless there's a compelling need for a large screen or Android's greater abilities once rooted, the iPhone is simply better than even this S4. It doesn't require any of the tweaking I've outlined, nor the low-level task management that seems to crop up so often even with Android 4. Likewise, the Windows Phone ecosystem isn't sufficiently mature to recommend that one over the iPhone.But if you want Android and you're willing to unlock the full potential of it, the S4 is as good as it gets for this screen size.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hands Down BEST Android phone (OVERALL)[Not even close now!]", "Author": "Joshua Techman", "ReviewID": "RALUHTJR72OH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PRO:FAST!Nice firmware!(Needs tweaking out of the box though)Great Camera with decent low light pics!(Better than iPhone 5) [auto setting needs improvement though]Screen is AWESOME!

I can finally play Temple Run 2 without intermittent stutter (which is a death sentence in that game).  Just a tip though, trash the Sprint and Samsung apps and stick with the Google ones.

I could type long text messages or emails with ease, and I never really had that much interest in switching to a non-keyboard phone.  Unfortunately, that decision was taken out of my hands somewhat.  I have the Droid 4 which I greatly enjoy, but it has it's own problems.  After having it for about a year it got a pretty nasty crack on it.  I played around with some friends GS3's and was very impressed with them.  However the rumors about the GS 4 coming out had already started so I decided to hold off.  I'm glad that I did, but a lot of my review will be based off of not having the GS3 and making such a drastic switch.  As I put in the title, it seems to be minor improvements upon a design they've found worked as opposed to the drastic changes previously seen.  Without further ado...The Looks:There isn't much positive to be said about the aesthetics of the Galaxy S4 body to be honest.  It looks and feels like a cheap toy.  It feels... clammy might be the best way to describe it.  It really isn't the best feel when you're holding it, and compared to the HTC One it's disappointing.  It doesn't seem like it had that much effort put into changing it.  It does feel sturdy though, despite being a very thin phone.  I was able to get a good grip on it though which is important to me since I'm rather small.  Overall I would give the looks a 2.5/5The Hardware:Huge upgrade over.. well anything but a computer.  This really is just a small computer, and it runs flawlessly.  The screen is massive and great.  Easily the best one that I've seen on a phone.  The 5\" screen could be a little bit big for some people I think, but for most of the younger generation will be ok with it though.  The battery is incredible as well.  My Droid 4 would die around 4 or so after a normal days use (streaming music, internet, tons of emails, etc).  This will last me all day, including going out at night which is a massive incentive to me.  The camera is great on it as well, much better than any other Android phone.  It is still slightly edged out by the iPhone though.  Overall though I would give it a 5/5 on hardwareThe Software:I'll start with the obvious, it's actually running the latest version of Jelly Bean, and should keep up better than other phones do (minus Nexus 4.)  This is a huge bonus, because Android's because fault is that the OS is so fragmented.  Now, Samsung has put a ton of their own software on top of Jelly Bean.  The best description would be that it's overwhelming probably.  There are a lot of Samsung apps that really will just never be used.  So I'm not even going to bother going over the party trick type apps.  Instead I'll talk about a few that really caught my attention.S Health:  Helpful now, will be awesome in the future.  The premise is that it's a basically a fitbit built into your phone.  It helps you track calories, steps walked, workouts, etc.  It works great now, but I don't think that it will get better with accessories.WatchON:  Basically it acts as a universal TV remote and a Netflix browser.  It's great, and I don't even watch very much TV.  I suspect that this will become the standard soon, but until then this is the best version you can get.Air View/Gesture:  A great idea, but not great in practice.  It's glitchy currently and doesn't always work (or does work in ways that you don't want it to.)Camera Software:  There's actually a lot of really great features that come with the camera.  The most novel of them is the ability to take a picture from the front and back cameras at the same time.  I can see this actually becoming standard in the future as well.Overall I think that the software is good, but not perfect.  Overall I would still rather just have stock jelly bean.  Samsung adds some good features, but it also adds a lot of stuff that I really don't need and can't get rid of.Final Impressions:It's a good phone, there's no doubt about that. It's not a great phone though.  The screen is amazing, the body isn't.  The software is good, the hardware is out of this world.  It all comes down to personal preference between this and the HTC One I think.  Personally I'm fine just putting a case on my GS 4, but I've always been more interested in battery and hardware.  I can completely understand picking a slight downgrade on those areas though in return for a great body like the HTC One has.4/5", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Dennis Abbate", "ReviewID": "RN5DXYRR7P7P0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this phone, can't put it downGreat display and fast processor.The battery life is very good so far.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Michael San Clemente", "ReviewID": "R1NHAWOTKGUH8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best of everything.

I had the SI and SII, my brother has the SIII. I would consider myself a seasoned owner who knows the phones well. My SII started getting wonky on me finally so I had to trade up. I considered the HTC One but went with the Galaxy based on my past history with the line. I am extremely happy I did.This phone absolutely blows the SII and SIII out of the water on just about every level. The speed of the phone is great. I was a little worried I was not able to switch off 4G, that was a huge battery killer on my past phones. But it seamlessly switches between networks without you noticing and doesn't drain the battery.Pros:-Does very well at managing battery life. I wake up at 5:30am unplug my phone and go to work. I don't have to plug it in at all during the day. I'll come home at 4:00pm and still have over 70% battery.-Fast opening, switching and closing apps. There is almost no lag between when you touch the app and when it actually opens.-Easy to set up email accounts. I had zero issues getting all my email accounts set up.-Multitasking done right. You can open multiple apps at once and switch between the two easily(ex. looking up an address, typing it in GMaps).-They finally brought back the ability to create folders in the app drawer. Makes it easy to get rid of clutter.-Display is bright and colors are very accurate. The auto dimming display is responsive and it actually works.- Easy to use. If you are familiar with the Galaxy line you will find it easy to transition to this phone. Even if you are not, most of the settings are easy to find and nothing is too buried in the menus.- Expandable memory (HTC One does not have this).- Camera is great and has a lot of features. You need to sit down and play with the camera for a while just to see everything it can do.- Replaceable battery (HTC One is sealed). My SII battery eventually bulged and had to be replaced. The ability to change the battery was a major decision point between the SIV and HTC One.- Inductive charging. The inductive charger back is coming out soon for this phone. Although if you search on ebay you can find the stock back cover with the inductive coil already on it. This one works for the Palm Touchstone which is an awesome little charger. You can fit it in your car cup holder.Cons:- Size: the phone is pretty large. I wish they had went with a 4.7\" screen instead. I compared it to my old SII and it was only slightly taller (~0.25\") but it is noticeably larger to hold.- Gestures: I really dislike the air gesture, and eye gesture crap. You can turn it off though!- Sound is not great but who buys a phone for great sound from a \u00d80.125\" speaker.- Email sync interval for Gmail is always on push. Can't change it to a different interval.- With headphone jack connected a warning message pops up when you go to high on the volume. It doesn't allow you to go any higher until you click OK. This would be easy to close if I didn't have my phone in my motorcycle jacket while traveling at 70mph down the freeway. It is pretty annoying and I hope they patch this eventually.- You can't use data while making a phone call. This is a huge problem if you are talking to someone and want to look something up without first hanging up. I don't know why they didn't enable this on the SIV when all the other ones had it. Again, a software fix can most likely fix this issue.Basically all of the cons can be either turned off or patched with a future update.Overall I am very happy with this phone. I have had no issues thus far. It has satisfied my needs very well. I use my phone for work, recreation, general internet browsing, social networking and all the normal phone functions.

Setup was incredibly simple and FAST.  I have had this phone for a week now and I can honestly say the S4 is simply awesome.  I can't find anything wrong with it! The screen is gorgeous, the speed is amazing and there are so many features, most of which I haven't even begun to play with.  I do love airview/air gesture (hand waves control gallery picture movement, text scrolling, etc).  I haven't really played with eye movement control yet but the feature seems way cool. I had considered the LG G2 since it has a Snapdragon 800 and is somewhat faster and has a slightly larger screen but Sprint had other ideas.  They won't even start shipping the phone until 'sometime around the holidays'.  I was willing to take on those funky buttons on the back of the phone but not if I have to wait for it so FORGET IT.  Besides, a friend has an S4 so now we can do the 'pnone bumb' to swap pics, music, etc.  It really works!  It's not quite as fast as the commercial would have you believe but it's fast enough and there were several very jealous iPhone owners who saw us do it! Now that I have the phone, I REALLY don't regret going for it and not waiting for the LG G2.  The phone is light, the battery lasts WAY longer than my HTC EVO 3D's did (loved that phone, despised the lack of battery power).  Regarding Touchwiz, yes there are lots of haters out there and yes the phone has plenty of bloatware running in the background.  BUT you can force stop those apps and they stay dormant until you power down.  They come back like a bad penny so don't power down!  Also, I have a Samsung Note tablet (running Android 4.1) so I am really familiar with Touchwiz.  One of the biggest selling points for me was the removeable battery and SD card.  The previous knock was you can't move apps to the SD card....only files.  Guess what?  I just downloaded an update and now you can move apps to the SD card so the 16gB RAM is no longer a limiting factor. Also, Sam's Club has a two-year insurance plan through SquareTrade for $99 with a $49 deductible.  That deal can't be beat.  One caveat:  you can only get that deal in-store.  BOTTOME LINE: the S4 will blow you away.  All who see it suddenly want one....especially the Apple fanboys and fangirls!  When you demo it for them, they turn green with envy!

Keller", "ReviewID": "R3RQVR8O0PPKTB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just upgraded from the original HTC Evo to the Galaxy 4S. I did love my Evo, but oh my what an improvement! So far (6/5/13) I have only had it one day, but I'll update as I continue to use it.Purchase and shipping:At $149.99 this was the cheapest place for the S4, beating Best Buy and Sprint.com by $100. The phone arrived exactly when it was estimated to. Not a bump or bend on the phone's box, which tells me it was protected perfectly.Hint: no, you are not purchasing a new contract when you check out. It told me that the phone comes with a $110/month contract, but Amazon doesn't actually sell you a contract. You're simply obligated to open one with Sprint. So for upgraders, don't fret, you're not going to be charged an additional $110 for this purchase.Out of the box:This phone is incredibly slim and lightweight. I'm constantly worried I'm going to drop it! The black is this beautiful, sophisticated metallic pattern, the edges banded in brushed aluminum, and the face (what isn't the screen) is a similar brushed aluminum pattern overlayed with a dot grid. All of this texture/patterning is quite subtle but adds a beautiful effect of quality. Yes, I know the back is plastic. But unless you're going to be tapping on it all the time, it feels 100% solid and except for not having the chilled feel of real metal, you'd never know it's plastic. There's no clicking corners, no gaps in the body. no sharp edges to catch stuff on. All of the physical buttons (power, volume and home) are very low profile, but easily accessible. Overall it is a very sleek and professional-looking phone.I couldn't tell you how long exactly that it took to charge the first time. I left the house after about an hour and a half, but when I came back it was fully charged after three hours on the charger. It's easy to activate - just go to sprint.com/activate and you'll chat with a representative. FYI to those who are on family plans but are not the account holder: you will need either the account holder's PIN or the answer to their security question. I'm not sure what happened, but mine did not activate the first time, the rep had me do some sort of reset, and it worked the second time.YOU WILL NEED ACCESS TO WIFI. I don't know why, but it would not let me skip a set up with the home wifi network. So make sure you have the network password in hand to complete initial setup.If you set it up with an existing Gmail account, make sure to log in and turn OFF 2-step verification if you have it enabled. Either that or print out the provided PINs, or have access to the specified back-up phone. Otherwise it will block you from proceeding further, until you verify the phone.First day:As with all phones, there is a lot of bloatware. I went through the App Manager and deleted everything I could, then opened Apps > menu button > Hide applications to remove the rest of them. For example, I use the Gmail app and not the Email app, so I hid the latter. Same with Chrome and IE. The apps aren't deleted, so if later you decide, say, you really do want to use the S Health app, just go to Apps > menu button > Show hidden applications to put it back in the main app menu.To get the \"Life Companion\" message off the lock screen, go to Settings > Lock screen widgets > clock or personal message, and edit as you want.Most of the personalization and adjustment is pretty intuitive. Hold your finger down to move the widget, or on a picture to crop or delete. For those who want a little more control, you can open the Developer Options by going to  settings > more > About device and tapping 7 times on Build number. Honestly, though, there's not much there the average user would want to mess with.The phone fits in my pocket pretty easily. Now, I'm a girl, and it's saying something when a phone can fit in girls' jeans pockets. But I wear plain ol' bootcut, so for you girls who wear the low-rise or hip-hugger jeans with teeny tiny pockets, I can promise that this phone won't fit.I've been messing with this phone since about 7pm yesterday. Even after being on a lot, playing games, and general first-day fidgeting with it, the battery is only down to 28% now that it's 4pm. That's fairly impressive, especially since it's been kicking on and off roaming in my concrete box of a building that I work in. Note, though, that I do turn off 3G/4G, wifi, bluetooth, NFC, etc. out of habit when I get to work, since it's just useless. And I must say, having the shortcut buttons placed already in the drop-down notifications menu is quite convenient! (Settings > my device > display > notification panel)Update 6/21/13:I am still in LOVE with this phone. The screen is beautiful, the body is beautiful, it responds wonderfully to touch, and it does everything I ask it to in the blink of an eye.I did end up turning off Air Gestures. There's not much use for it other than when in the browser or gallery, and I just found it a little clunky. You have to do specific gestures over a sensor at the top. The only one I really liked anyways was that you could swipe your palm over the phone while it's off, and the screen would show the time and any notifications. Likewise, Smart Screen is off as well... mostly because I just don't want that sensor eating battery all the time.Update 10/17/13:Yup, I STILL love this phone. I can actually make it 2 or 3 days between charges - remember, though, that I turn off my data connections for half of the day (and considering how easy it is to turn them off and on, I would suggest anyone looking to stretch battery life consider doing that too.) Now that my state has banned phone use in vehicles - period - I'm playing with the Driving Mode and S Voice. Yes, you can just click a button, and your phone will become voice activated while you're driving. I wonder how that does when connected to a car via Bluetooth (unfortunately my car does not have Bluetooth :( so sad.)I have an OtterBox 77-27604 Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - 1 Pack - Carrier Packaging - Black on my phone. It's quite nice, and fits perfectly. I've already dropped the phone a dozen times on concrete and wood floors, both in the Otterbox and in cheaper cases (once flat on the face with no case, on tile), and it has not one scratch or crack. I'm probably just lucky, but it is a testament to the phone that it's not had an issue with the (accidental) rough handling.I'm a tiny bit annoyed that the Home button seems to catch a bit. You know when you click a button and it makes a \"harder\" click than usual, like the mechanism inside is not so smooth? That's what it's doing. Not by much, but noticeable. That is my only annoyance; however, it doesn't affect the functionality or response of the button, and it hasn't seem to have gotten worse in the 2 months since I noticed it, so it's not really important.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "screen stopped working after 6 weeks", "Author": "C.

There's been plenty of techy info posted, so I'll keep this to the point.  (I'm an average cellphone user; a Smith).There were several reasons I personally chose the Galaxy S4...1. I prefer a plastic cover on the back.  Unlike an aluminum/metal cover, plastic doesn't transfer as much heat and easy access to #2 below.2. Replaceable battery.3. Expandable memory via MicroSD card to hold my music and pictures/videos.4. The 5\" screen using the same demensions as similar smartphones with smaller screen sizes.5. I thought about staying with HTC and getting the HTC One, but I wouldn't use the live feeds on its Home Screen.  Live feeds probably drain the battery, too.  I just don't do social networks, etc.  (In fairness, some reviews said you can bypass that Home Screen.)The Galaxy S4 screen is flawless and vivid.  The Galaxy S4 is much larger than the HTC Evo Shift it replaced, but it's lighter and much thinner.  It took no time to prefer the larger S4.  The camera is amazing; no shutter lag, crystal clear images, and many multiple options.Call quality, sound, reception has been fantastic.  No problems with data usage, GPS, etc.The one gripe I have isn't with the Galaxy S4, it's with the Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean).  ANY smartphone running Android 4.1 or higher (that's all the new phones out now... Samsung, HTC, LG, etc.) don't have a Flash Player Plug-in for web content.  Adobe decided it would stop making their flash player plug-in available for devices running higher than Android 4.0... Android 4.0 is the last version the plug-in is available for.  I've been looking and looking, there's no app out right now for this issue.  I contacted Samsung directly; they recommended downloading Macromedia Player on Google Play... uh... Macromedia is now Adobe.  So for now, once in a while surfing the Net, you'll come across some flash content the Android 4.1+ can't show.As far as the Galaxy S4 is concerned, it's a cheetah on steroids with the sex appeal of Rita Hayworth and the strength of Hercules.  No complaints so far.  If there are any longevity issues, I'll post them later on.UPDATE 5/22- Windows users... while the S4 is plugged into your computer and turned on, do a Windows Update.  It will find a software/driver update so the S4 is more easily recognized by your computer to upload/download files like a drive.  Just follow the recommended installation directions... EZ.UPDATE 5/28- I agree with some other reviewers that the ringer melodies loaded could be louder when the phone rings.  I downloaded a free app called Old Phone Ringtones, which has louder-sounding options by the sound they make.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Tons of features", "Author": "Sergio garcia", "ReviewID": "R28NQ076NJM8GE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great, I bought it at best buy and it's one of the best phones that I have ever owned.

I love both phones and the Note had that glorious screen and built in S-Pen. But, for me, as a phone, the Note is just a bit too big for my personal taste and I found the call volume to be weak even with sound boost.So I moved to the S4, thinking it would give me most of the benefits of the Note in a more compact package. After a couple of weeks using this I can tell you it is a fantastic phone. I am running the latest version of KitKat and this phone is smooth as silk with little to no lag. The screen is gorgeous, the size is perfect, and the call quality is outstanding. This is my fourth Samsung phone and I understand some the critics complaining about TouchWiz, battery life, etc. Here's a couple of simple things I did :I downloaded Nova Launcher and run it as my main launcher. Is very smooth and fast. Secondly, the stock battery, quite frankly, is lousy. I purchased two after market batteries and a charger from Amazon then purchased an extended 5200 mah battery as well. I am currently using one of the standard size batteries and still at 20% life after almost eleven hours. That is excellent. Screen brightness maxed, bluetooth on, etc. Moderate to heavy usage. So, while the stock battery isn't that good, the phone itself doesn't just suck the juice. A better battery makes a world of difference.This is the best phone I've had in Sprint.

That means that if I leave it sitting around unused for, say, 24 hours, I want there to be significant juice left. My previous phone, the SII, even after the installation of a new OEM battery, could barely last 24 hours while it idled. That meant that my phone owned because I had to always make sure it was plugged in. Thus, I'm quite pleased with the S4. It idles much more efficiently (and or has a bigger battery) to the point that a single charge can last 72 hours or so (as I write this, my phone has been unplugged for 44 hours and has 39% battery remaining).In addition, the S4 is snappy and very useable when I need it. The Sprint 4GLTE network coverage leaves much to be desired, but that's not the phone's fault.On the downside with Android, I worry that future updates to the OS will slow down the phone and drain the battery (as seemd to happen with the SII).

However, while the Nexus 5 has no problem with any of the ac routers I've purchased, the Galaxy S4 continues to be a problem.  Range seems to be the biggest issue with the GS4 and an ac router -- I can't go more than a few feet away before losing substantial speeds and/or experiencing a complete loss of signal. I tried different routers and different firmwares with the same results and it happened on both of my GS4s. One particular firmware with the Netgear got me a greater range, but stability was much worse with loss of connections every few minutes. I'd like to think it's just a router issues, but the Nexus 5 doesn't have a problem with any router or any firmware version so I'm holding Samsung accountable on this one.Ultimately, I've decided to stick to the 2.4Ghz connection and the phone will work fine, but it's a shame that the 5Ghz ac connection won't work with this phone.Routers Used:Netgear AC1900 R7000 NighthawkStock Firmware Versions: V1.0.2.194_1.0.15 // V1.0.2.164_1.0.15Kong Firmware Versions: 23250Asus AC1900 RT-AC68RFirmware Version: 3.0.0.4.374_205My Devices capable of 5GHz:Two Separate Galaxy S4 phones (802.11ac)Nexus 5 Phone (802.11ac)Nexus 7 Tablet (non 802.11ac)Panasonic TC-PST50 Television (non 802.11ac)Symptoms on Netgear AC1900 R7000 with firmware version V1.0.2.164_1.0.15:Galaxy S4 experienced sufficient coverage and speeds on 5GHz network but experienced unreliable connections with random drops occurring every few minutes. Only GS4 would display these issues, Nexus Devices and TV maintained connection to network/internet as well as the 2.4GHz devices and ethernet plugged devices.Symptoms on Netgear AC1900 R7000 with firmware version V1.0.2.194_1.0.15:Galaxy S4 had excellent speed with VERY limited range. Within 5 feet of router, phone obtained maximum connection speeds. After that, every few feet speeds would drop significantly. Once out of the room (less than 15 feet away), the GS4 would lose connection entirely. Nexus devices and TV did not experience this issue.Symptoms on Netgear AC1900 R7000 with firmware by Kong, version 23250:Exact same symptoms and results as with the stock Netgear firmware version V1.0.2.194_1.0.15 -- VERY limited range.Symptoms on Asus AC1900 RT-AC68R with firmware Version: 3.0.0.4.374_205:Exact same symptoms and results as with the stock Netgear firmware version V1.0.2.194_1.0.15 -- VERY limited range.Attempted Fixes:Factory Resets on Routers and GS4Tried different channels on the router using WiFi analyzer to help chooseSpecifying Wireless Modes (N+AC, N, Auto, etc)Disabled WiFi Power Save Mode on GS4Notes:No noticeable issues with the 2.4GHz or wired devices with any router or firmware versions -- though I've been primarily focusing on the 5GHz.Phone: Software Version: MK2, Hardware Version: L720.08, Non Rooted", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "ricoman", "ReviewID": "R54BG5F1Q0DCX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the Samsung Galaxy S4.

This is the reason I chose Samsung over HTC.  My previous phone was an HTC and it did have a microSD slot and removable battery but with the One series they chose to follow Apple with a sealed unit, which was a deal-killer for me.  I never have to worry about battery life as I always have a spare battery charged in my pocket and I have battery chargers at home and at work as well as wireless chargers at home and at work.  I pretty much swap batteries whenever my phone drops below 30-40% battery.  Swapping and rebooting takes just seconds and them I'm back at 100%.  I have a 64GB microSD and it's awesome but I do wish I could get a 128GB.  I have a TON of music on it (about 470 albums).  By comparison, I recently got my wife the iPhone 5s 32GB and I am unable to even put 120 albums on that before it's filled up.  My main complaint about the GS4 is that the power button is on the side.  It should be on the top as I bump it a lot accidentally with it being on the top.  I am curious what'll happen if and when Samsung comes out with a flexible phone.  I hope they'll still be able to offer a removable battery and microSD slot.  Incidentally, the camera on this phone is amazing!  It's definitely the best small camera I've ever used.  The only thing that does better for me is my SLR but that's too much to lug around.

Anyways I'm coming off of a iphone 4s and I've had experience w/ android and apple devices. Also I work as an IT. Don't worry I'm not gojng to tech speak you to death.Pros:Pretty decent speed.Battery lasts a while under certain usage (I'll cover the bad in the con). But for the most part, I'll go to the gym etc for a few of hours and It'll still be in the high 90's. Iphone would be 70% or lower.The Android experience is pretty good on this phone.The graphics and video are also nice as well.Keeps better track of emails than my iPhone and computer. Although my iphone gets emails 5 sec earlier.Ummm kind of a good work phone. Well its good in the aspects of continuously staying in contact w/ others.It's actually starting to read my mind on things. And I like some of the functions where it accommodates to you.Cons:Battery life. If you're plugged into the computer and using it for certain things, you can actually use more power than it's charging with. In other words you may still be draining power while charging on the computer. During some times when constantly using this, it will take a big chunk. But not as much as the iPhone.The speaker/audio is pretty poor. At work we tried to use it on a speaker mode so me and a  coworker could hear a project manager and it was just bad. Normally I use earbuds w/ a mic in it.Sprint sucks... I had to contact BBB again about them... again.It's kind of not a good work phone in the aspect of the camera isn't as detailed/clear as the iPhone one is. Iphone I would take pics and/or scans of documents then send them out. This one, its more of a hassle. Doesn't quite do it or it requires more takes. I still keep my iPhone around.Has too many functions that rely on gps, giving out signals, locations etc. It's annoying at times; only cause I don't like things like that.Has alot of functions but a good amount are hidden or should just be categorized better.Had to ummm do a little work on it so I can have a little more freedom with it. (Not rooting).Etc:Rooting:Rooting (even one click), is illegal and will void your warranty.  Also if you're a newb you may do something that will brick your phone. Keep in mind that there's also chances that your phone will be glitchy, turn evil, be vulnerable etc. Always back up your info yada yada.Also don't be an idiot and brag about it on here.

However, for my mom I suggested she get the S4 over the note 2 she originally wanted.  I did this for a few reasons.  The S4 is much newer than the note 2 and after having an infuse 4g for the past 2 years a nice new phone was much needed!  Another reason I suggested the S4 was due to its size. My mom is about 5'7\" and I figured the 5 inch form factor was much better for her than the somewhat unwieldy size of the note 2 or note 3. When it comes to screen my mom is more than pleased.  She immediately commented on the clarity and color saturation before she even was finished setting up her google account.  It is a gorgeous display.  There is no other way around that.  So far she has had it for about a week and has experienced nothing in the way of lag.  Of course my mom barely knows that games exist on android much less the fact that you can play some graphically intense ones so she isn't really putting the phone to huge processor loads but it Is working great even if it is just a Snapdragon 600 compared to a snapdragon 800. Overall my mom loves her phone.  That brings me to who this phone is for.  The s3 was praised due to the fact that it was made for everyone and I think the s4 is in the same boat.  If you are a spec hungry person that needs the most powerful phone and actually knows the difference between the snapdragon 600 and 800 then you really don't need this review, but for everyone else who just needs a phone that works well in everyday use, that looks gorgeous this is the phone for you.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Samsung Galaxy S4", "Author": "Timothy D.
