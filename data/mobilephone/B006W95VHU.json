Despite all the reviews in Youtube from different companies. The phone works great, its incredible fast and it is the last phone with the freedom you need to add extra memory since the new HTC models doesn't have the micro SD slot and not removable battery (or back cover).This phone comes already unlocked from the provider and you don't have to introduce an unlocking code. It comes on its original box (AT&T;), it's brand new but the only issue is that phone doesn't come with earphones. It's not big issue at all, bur it would be great if HTC could include the earphones with microphone.The battery duration might be an issue, so I recommend to buy:- Anker External Battery Pack- Hyperion AT&T; HTC Vivid 4G 2 x Battery + ChargerFor less than $400 USD this is an excellent choice for an android phone.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love my new cell phone", "Author": "Herbert", "ReviewID": "R2B1ETGV3MLF9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, the cell is completely unlocked and functional, very good lucking and so fast.

I own a canon powershot A95 camera which gives gorgeous pictures maybe not a fair comparison since it is a camera vs a phone.

My fiance had the Vivid at one point and it was amazing. We did our research, and read all reviews of all that we were looking at. IDK if the good reviews got lucky and actually got what they ordered, or if they're people who work for the company. I paid $189.00 for a refurbished phone, the volume buttons were completely worn, I got a used battery, the charging port was loose, and the plastic around it had been buffered. When I emailed the company the response was quick, and I was told if I sent the phone back they'd refund my money and compensate me an extra $10 for the shipping. When I clicked the button that said 16 new there was one to select out of them, the rest were ATT only. While I received an unlocked phone, it was not new. I strongly suggest you listen to my review and the others. We'll see how smoothly it goes for me to get my refund, which btw you should be covering the return shipment in the first place.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Damaged device", "Author": "Tato", "ReviewID": "R25E0KNO3TVJ9S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I chose this rating, because i received device which is not working correctly, bluetooth does not share files, it's 8MP camera takes about VGA quality pictures and videos, battery discharges too fast and e,t.c.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointing battery life, no option to change notification settings", "Author": "heat20", "ReviewID": "R3F3Y5GTKPQEY2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a good enough phone, but for me the battery life was very disappointing. Let me start by explaining that this is my first smartphone and I got it mostly for the screen size and camera; the FM radio is also a nice feature, as I always like this in my phones but didn't think smartphones even bothered adding this. Anyway, in contrast to most smartphone users, I'm not one to use a lot of downloaded apps and have no need to be constantly updated or connected online; I text some, talk a little (I'm not a chatterbox) and listen to music once in a while and that's about it. The first few days I hardly used it at all, and yet the battery would drain pretty fast. Soon enough I learned to turn off Wi-Fi, unnecessary apps (background data), turned off synch on email, etc. but the battery was still going fast, and so was my data allowance (have very little data on my prepaid plan, since I never used much on my previous device, a \"dumb\" phone). Uneasy about the battery life and unwilling to upgrade to a plan with more data, I finally decided to just turn off its internet connection in the settings; I only turn it on to send or receive pic messages (which isn't often) or to do a web search (even less often). Doing this has finally extended my battery to about 3 days and data is no longer being devoured. I get that doing this basically defeats the purpose of having a smartphone in the first place, but like I said, I got it mostly for the screen size and camera; if there'd been an all-touchscreen dumb phone with the aforementioned features, I would've bought that instead.Something currently bothering me is the notifications for texts and missed calls. It only sounds once and that's it, so as a result, sometimes I don't become aware of missed texts or calls until much later. I've tried searching in settings for a way to change this, but can't seem to find the option (my phone is not rooted). With all of my previous phones I was able to choose how often to be notified (every minute, every 5 minutes, etc.) so I'm surprised that this phone doesn't seem to have that. It does have a tiny blinking green light as an alert of something missed, but it's barely visible and it's on for only a few minutes.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mano", "Author": "catherine caroo", "ReviewID": "RJ0I3JJ0BL52C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my wife and the device never came on.

Considering this is an AT&T; phone, and we are using AT&T;, this is not an unlocking issue the phone is defective. We took it to AT&T; and they confirmed that it was a dead refurbished phone. It is almost like Tablet Distributors tried to refurbish it, couldn't figure out what was wrong and sold it anyways. This phone is being sent back.The phone looked like new, other than the manufacturer's warranty seal being broken. The box has a disclaimer on it, \"The Cellular phone contained herein did not emanate from the original manufacturer, and no representation or warranties are made as the source origin. The phone many be new or used, but restored into operable condition. No other representations or warranties, either express or implied, are made.\"I have no problem buying refurbished products, when they are actually refurbished. However, this phone was not restored to operable condition and should not have been listed as New on Amazon.((UPDATED AFTER SECOND ATTEMPT))This is my second attempt to get a working HTC Vivid from Tablet Distributors. The phone arrived with the wrong size battery. I tried to shim it into place, but I could not get any life out of it. Fortunately my wife had not sent back the first HTC Vivid that we received so I was able to pull the battery out of that phone.The battery from the first phone fired up the second phone and the phone was able to connect to the AT&T; network, unlike the first phone. The phone itself was very nice. Nice bright screen and good feel overall. My wife spent some time setting up the phone before the battery warning popped up. Since she had it on charge the entire time so we were a bit confused.When you first plug in the phone the battery charge icon comes on, but then after 30 seconds it stops. If you hold the charger plug in at a slight angle it will charge for maybe two minutes before giving up.I have always purchased unlocked phones on Amazon for myself. I work in Europe frequently and like being able to swap sim cards. Since I had always had good luck, I finally convinced my wife to try an unlocked phone. Thanks to this experience, she will never buy another unlocked phone. She is currently headed to AT&T; to pick up a Samsung Galaxy S4.

It connected to the 4G network immediately, and I got it connected to my home WiFi with only a few steps.  It comes loaded with quite a few Apps--I don't know how standard all of these are, since my experience is limited, but there is certainly enough here for me to play with for awhile.The camera is great; it takes better pictures than my Canon PowerShot. The lowlight setting is really amazing, and it is impressive what great night pictures the camera takes.The only problem I have had with the \"HTC Vivid\" is the battery.  It runs through its battery surprisingly quick.  It barely holds a charge for a single day, and needs to be re-charged as often as possible. I also think some of the button positioning is odd.  The external volume switch is right where you hold the phone during a normal phone call, so I am constantly accidentally muting my phone. That just takes some practice and getting used to though.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "is it Gsm unlocked ?", "Author": "mdeberky", "ReviewID": "R31VMPSNZT2TZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dose any one have any idea about if any if this product Gsm unlocked ?
