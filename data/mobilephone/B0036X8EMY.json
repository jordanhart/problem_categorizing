{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Roy", "ReviewID": "RXB2UPVC6QC2D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the international version of this phone and have had it for about a month.  It is small so it is easy to carry and store, and it also comes with loads of features that allows me carry one device when I travel, like the great sounding speakers,FM radio, the Memo option. It allows for the easy download of music from my computer, being small and portable it is also great for when I go runing. Needless to say, I am, therefore, using my Ipod less and less.  My only and a  big dissappointment is that the instructions manual is in Frech and other languages, but not in English.  It  comes with a CD which contains an soft version of the manual in English, but I am on the go, and don't have the time to sort throught files to find information I need,  nor do I think that this is should be the only option.  So this to me is indeed a major dissappointment.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Marq", "ReviewID": "R25YV28TQT0EBD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first touch-screen phone. Did a lot of research before I settled on this one. The Marvel seemed to have the the best ratings amongst the phones in its class.When I received it, the language was Portuguese. I manage to sort it out though (I eventually had to sit and read the manual).PROS:The interface is quite impressive and it fits nicely in my palm for one hand operations. The screen's very sensitive to touch and the widgets are very useful. The wi-fi allows me to surf at home and at other hot-spots.  I can get the QWERTY keypad when I tilt the phone horizontally and I can key/type with average speed (a surprise given the size of the 'keys'). Calls are clear and the picture quality is very good (not the sharpest but clear enough). The video playback is ok, but viewing youtube on the phone's browser is average.CONS:At first, the interface was difficult to negotiate (I didn't read the manual as yet and this is my first touch) and the phone contacts' not the best I've seen. Using speed dail for contacts with multiple numbers is not allowed, I had to create another contact of the same name with a different number. It took me some google-ing (and luck) to get the wi-fi up and running. I cannot access the Optimus website (and the language's in Spanish or Portuguese), so I cannot get any of Samsung's goodies for the phone.As Ilearn more about the phone, I'll update this review. I bought the phone at a very affordable price (it's hard to get this phone, oftentimes it is out of stock). I hope that this review was helpful to you.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "No added value", "Author": "Josu\u00e9", "ReviewID": "R2CC3L8M9TVLY3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had the phone for a year and a half and I know is time to change it all though is missing several characteristics for new buyers like android and a mixer in the music app, this is not a 3g phone is slow with internet apps and will give trouble with battery; as a plus the phone is still working after one year and a half and for gral use without internet is about fine.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Please Do not Buy!", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "R2TCL4UMARA9N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Samsung S5560 Marvel 3-Inch WQVGA Display Touchscreen Unlocked Phone with GSM Quad Band, 5MP Camera, MP3/WMA/AAC Player, and Stereo Bluetooth (Black)I own this phone for an yearIt works great as a phone making calls, messaging..etcTHIS IS NOT A SMART PHONE!!!When you are trying to connect to internet it says \" No DNS response\"After all TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT WORKINGThe wifi and other stuff are like : installing Windows 7 in 1990's PC...I never expect this from SAMSUNG....Put some more money and buy an ANDROID phone...", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not as good as I expected", "Author": "Karl Angas", "ReviewID": "RAIGEC3EWCEON", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Wish I would have ordered the xperia mini instead, this phone is clumsy, unresponsive and slow.

It is frustrating to find that facebook and other widgets are defaulted and i cannot find a way to close off the default widgets, and there is nothing in the user manual to tell me how.  Eventually i will get to it, but it shouldnt be so difficult to close off unwanted widgets.When i plug the phone into my pc, it tends cut out my wireless internet connection.  I need to plug in phone before i switch on pc.  the samsung software should not be so interferring.  When connected, the sync is slow and asks too many questions.  Just to the sync job for heaven's sake.I cannot find the phone on the US samsung site for support.It is hard to get to missed calls, favorites, etc.  it takes several clicks and it is not intuitive.It is the hardest phone i have the misfortune of buying.  My previous phone: ATT tilt was much easier to use.Prosgood battery life even with wi-fi on.good ergonomics.good camera for cell phone.good graphics.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Execelente....", "Author": "bian", "ReviewID": "R332G0AYVZRXM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Tiene todo lo que se necesita, el sistema operativo es bastante amigable, si lo que necesita es un celular para entrar al mundo del touch este es una buena compra", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tengo rechazada mi tarjeta de credito y tengo todos mis creditos no entiendo", "Author": "Jes\u00fas Alfredo", "ReviewID": "R26MXKEOYU603Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buenas amigo, he tenido problemas con mi pedido porque a segun mi tarjeta de credito a sido rechazada.
