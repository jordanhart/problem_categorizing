My only real gripe is the audio quality during phone calls is poor, I contacted Vigin Mobiles customer services and was impresed with their professionalism and efforts to improve my service. They performed diagnostics and the audio did improve but its random. This issue may be due to the region I reside in, there are lots of bodies of water, hills and mountains that affect cell signals, I had simular issues with my last verizon cotract. I will live with it for now and give Virgin mobile more chances to improve this issue, I'm having lots of fun with this phone though.:-)", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "I absolutely love this phone!!", "Author": "sharelle davis", "ReviewID": "R2RCJBTNRKC02O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't had any issues with the phone and it is working better than expected.
