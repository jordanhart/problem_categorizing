I'm always looking for other phones that offer the same level of performance and reliability.I'm giving the Pantech Breeze C520 a try and have the following to report after a few days of use.The exterior of the phone is smooth with no sharp edges like found on the Smasung A107.The flip is solid and looks like it will last at least as long as the A107. The flip is easier to open, probably due to it being larger and having a more pronounced division between it and the body/keyboard of the phone.I like having the external display. I wish Pantech had done a better job of mounting the plastic screen cover as the edges are raised above the casing of the phone and even with my mechanic's fingers, I can feel the sharp edge of the plastic. It is nothing compared to the really sharp edges found all over the Samsung A107. {note} I removed all the sharp edges of the Samsung with a file so I could carry the thing in my pocket without cutting my hand going after my change.I like having a camera. While it will not replace my Finepix point-n-shoot or my Canon 20D, it's a welcome addition to my E.D.C. (every day carry). The camera is mounted on the body of the phone and not on the flip. This makes aiming the camera a little troublesome in some situations but considering it's a 640 x 480 resolution \"blur-grabber\" I'll just let it go.The Pantech has a nice loud speaker on the back. I'm enjoying this and expect to find interesting ways to get in trouble with this :)The casing is firm and does not deform when being handled. The finish is very smooth and collects finger prints.The inside display is \"big\" compared the the Samsung. The software is ok but has some issues. the most notable has to do with selecting a Network Carrier. When you do a Manual Search, the phone identifys the compatible carriers in your area but does not provide a button or key to select the carrier. I was able to get text messaging setup for T-Mobile. {rant} The parameters required to configure cell phones should be standardized and the terms used should be uniform between carriers. All the non-sense these guys use just makes the customer frustrated and likely to \"churn\". While some churn is usually good for business, I would like to point out that Apple is clobbering the cell phone market by providing phones that are simple and easy to use. Perhaps this \"dumbing-down\" can be viewed as good or bad, but the bottom line is they have removed as much frustration as they can from their products and the results are evident.Sorry, I went on a rant.The Pantech keyboard is really good. At first I was worried that the flat keys would be hard to use but they click nicely and are spaced and sized well. The three quick dial keys, while useless to me would seem to be nice for people with kids or parents on a shared plan of some sort. I would like to be able to re-purpose them to access functions in the phone.The last issue has to do with the charge-port cover. Bad job Pantech, you guys messed-up on this. The cover is difficult to operate and does not remain fully closed. It will probably break off simply from snagging something in my pocket. So much design and planning went into the rest of this phone, why did you skimp on the thing people will be using every day.Ok, so there's a first impressions review. I'll come back in a little while and do an update.Oh, and a plug for the vendor I used, Cell Phone Stop has someone there who is thinking and responsive to requests. I'll do business with them again, but I'll be a little more careful in my selection of phones. This Pantech phone is good, but the Samsung Rugby I bought had hidden damage rendering it useless for it's intended purpose. \"Rugged\" phones with broken hinges are no longer \"rugged\".Update: 11/24/2012 - After a week or so of using this phone I went back to using my Treo 680. This Pantech phone has too many \"gotchas\" in it and was making me unhappy. The software is poor and the casing has that stupid and annoying issue with the charging port cover.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pantech Breeze phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3RTISBKF9MS9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was received only 3 days after I ordered!...I did not ASK for expedited schipping, but got it!

I thought I was getting the same phone I had before. Instead, I got something that looks like a relic from 1998, and probably is.The phone has been charging for three hours: still not full.By default, there is an annoying BEEP every time you press any key. Think about how annoying this would be. Then, think about the extra, pointless battery drain. This is a throwback to when most people were unfamiliar with mobile phones and would want to hear a noise when they dialed. Now, it is just annoying and wasteful. We managed to turn that annoying sound off...by setting the phone to vibrate only. So, now I have a choice: if I want my phone to ring when someone calls me, I have to listen to the beeps for every key press. If I don't want the annoying beeps, my phone won't ring. Lovely.Another irritating and archaic feature is the address book: there are six AT&T; numbers like ATT&T; Now and Pay My Bill that sit at the top of your address book and cannot be deleted or moved. With the Breeze II, at least those moved to the bottom of the list when I entered numbers I might actually call, but with this outdated phone, they stay at the top.I could go on, but why? The Breeze II and Breeze III are decent clamshell dumb phones if that's what you want. This is a decade out of date, horribly designed, and badly overpriced. At $20, I would not feel ripped off. At $68, I feel like I've been had. This is getting returned tomorrow Run screaming from this ancient piece of junk. You would be far better off with a refurb Breeeze II or even just a contract phone. You are not saving any money here. You are only going to be frustrated and unhappy.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good basic phone", "Author": "zamtwin", "ReviewID": "R2RA6OISXKOALF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Similiar to what my mother had before so that is why I purchased it. Except, it did not have a slot for the mini sd card for photos like her old phone did. This is the same manufacturer except this one is from China. Could this be why there is no mini sd card slot for photos to be stored onto??? The ringer volume is so much more lower than what she had before also. Still tho, the clarity of volume from phone calls she makes or receives is great! I had no problem getting it to work once i put her At&T; sim card in it.
