Tsang", "ReviewID": "RAC44XKJTVK2N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this phone as a gift in September 2009. Everything worked and if you asked me 2 weeks ago I would give it a 4 star.2 weeks a ago all of a sudden the touch screen stopped responding to tapping (finger or stylus) and I mean it's totally unresponsive! I didn't drop it or pour water over it when it stopped working (normal office/home usage is how I would classify my usage pattern). The only thing is good for is the receiving call via physical button - which renders this phone totally useless unlike other keypad phone even if something dosen't work.I cannot retrieve any data because connection via USB requires tapping - mere 9 months of normal use and the touch screen is dead - I would not get a Samsung phone for a long time.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "good for the price", "Author": "James M.
