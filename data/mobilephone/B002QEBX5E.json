It has flash support right out of the box and webpages show up the way they are supposed to be viewed as if from a computer and not the handicapped mobile version of websites that appear for other phone web browsers.  What other phone allows you to play farmville from your phone browser without downloading something extra?  There is no need to download a facebook app or a twitter app when you can have the whole website.The phone is very fast and allows for true multitasking.  I'm able to play Angry Birds, while listening to my music loaded on the phone, while downloading updates in the background, all the while connected to my big screen TV through the included A/V cables.  I can do all of those things without a stutter and have another dozen windows and programs open at the same time.  The N900 plays GBA and SNES roms smoothly and makes good use of the keyboard.The desktop widgets are a nice touch to make the home screen interesting and extremely customizable.The 5 MP camera takes some of the best cellphone pictures I have ever seen and makes it very convenient to load onto the Internet.The second camera on the front of the phone allows for pretty decent video calls through included Skype support or the Fring program.Battery life lasts about a day.  I comfortably get through the day with 20% of my battery life left after checking email, playing a game or two, listening to a few songs, checking my favorite websites, and talking to a few friends.Mobile hotspot.  This phone can be a mobile hotspot without paying your carrier anything extra.NEGATIVES3G support only for T-Mobile and not AT&T.;  I've used it with AT&T; for months but had to settle for EDGE (2G) speed.  Wifi support makes that less of a problem at home but inconvenient out and about.The GPS is lacking because compared to all of the other Nokia phones with voice guided GPS, this one does not have voice guidance.  So coming from an older Nokia device to this, it is a disappointment to not have voice guidance.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "One of the best devices ever made", "Author": "G.

I'll be holding on to it for a while because no one has made a phone nearly as good.  If you want the power of a Linux Desktop in your pocket this is the device for you.  You can running pretty much any program that you can on a Linux Desktop.  You have not only the bunch of programs available in Maemo repositories, but you also have all the Debian repositories available.I see some reviews talking about bad battery life.  I have great battery life.  It last a day and a half with a good about of usage.  I did have a battery issue a one point, but that was because I changed out the default kernel for one with a few more feature.  The battery would only last 4 or 5 hours then, but once I reloaded the stock kernel the battery life went back up to over a full day.I love having a physical keyboard. And the Camera is pretty good.  If you are looking for the fastest and the newest hardware, this is obviously not the phone for you.  It was pretty good when it came out, but that was a while ago.  But, if power and freedom in software is what you want this is the only phone I would recommend.  It can do many many things other phones can't, just because the other phones have limitations put on them by the manufacturers.

I don't think you need a service with a phone like this! It's just like having a computer. I'm not really picky as long as I can use it. It came on time! My other phone wasn't functioning properly so the time I received it saved me.Cons: It's a used phone for $99. I didn't expect it to be functioning like new. It came with extra batteries like seller said but only because it has trouble sustaining battery life and USB port came loose and fell out of phone when I pulled out USB cord on the day I got it. I couldn't really charge it through cord anyway because it wasn't detecting power through the cord. I have to change to a new charged battery three to four times in a day for the past two days I've had it.There's also left over information from previous owner in the phone.

In light of the current experience, I can not recommend these phones to anybody, Also, Nokia stopped developing their Maemo line and actually got purchased by Microsoft. I do not expect much support coming from there... :-( F for Fail. The vendors proved to be dishonest. I returned the phone via UPS (another $18 I have to spend on that). Seller received the phone a week ago and since their only reaction was to claim they need \"1-2 business days to review the item\". They did not replaced or refunded the purchase.

I used it primarily for making calls.  I wanted to upgrade due to the texting, picture, and MMS craze.  I purchased the Nokia N900 through Amazon and it was a problem from the first day.  Once I received it I noticed it did not have picture sending (MMS) capability.  When I called Nokia to enquire, they told me that it doesn't have that feature.  I had very bad battery life and the phone was replaced by Amazon within the first 30 days, with the same result.  I decided to keep it and live with the poor battery life.  Then the phone started doing things like the calendar would not remind me if I set it for multiple day reminders.  It started turning itself off and turning back on again and the turning control wouldn't work.  I had to scroll through all my contacts to make a call.  I contacted Nokia to get the phone repaired to no avail.  I sent this phone in four times and they sent a replacement twice with the same results.  I would not recommend this phone to anyone.

I received it yesterday January 27th from USPS and just after an hour, it indicated that the battery was low. I put it on charge and went out for 6 hours. I came back and the phone was still signalling that the battery is low. I decided to switch it off so that the charging can be effective and after an hour, i tried switching it on and it won't come on. Now i'm stuck with a new phone that cannot be switched on. Just for me to be sure i was not scammed, i checked the product information and the phone is made in Finland, the charger is made in China and the USB cord is made in Thailand. Isn't that fishy? I will take it to a nokia customer center for an evaluation. I hope they give me some good news else i will spread the bad news like a wild fire.I had high hopes for this phone because i have always been a loyal customer of nokia phones but now i'm wondering as to whether i was scammed or that the phone isn't good after all. I can't say anything good or bad about the phone until i get some information from nokia. I'm happy for those who have had a good experience. I can't say the same thing.
