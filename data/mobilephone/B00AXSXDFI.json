{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great phone you should have no problem considering", "Author": "Adrian", "ReviewID": "R1EBAMWL2XP3CJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been looking for a waterproof mobile phone for a long time. I even bought one made for use in the Japanese market, but had to give it up because it's features were so dumbed down for outside Japan, that it wouldn't receive signal outside the country I bought it in I'm in Asia). So when Sony came out with the Acro, a waterproof phone which wasn't tiny (I can't type on screens smaller than 4 inches) and wasn't slow as a dog (not mentioning Motorola's attempts at waterproof mobiles), I gave it a try. I chose white because it looks better than black, and I have this fear that if I drop it in the pool or ocean, it'd be easier to see when trying to catch it before it disappears from sight.(you can read my review at the Acro page in Amazon)I was so confident that recently I went to the beach and went into the water with it. I'd already done it once before a few months ago. However, this time, the waves were much stronger, and I was waist deep in the water when a couple of consecutive waves hit me, twisting my phone from my grasp, and my acro slipped away, never to be seen again. The white colour helped not a whit. It was totally my fault. In hindsight (such a wonderful thing...), I realised I should have at least put a string/wrist strap on it, which I did have, but was currently attached to my torch.So fast forward a day, I was without a mobile phone, so I rushed down to the local telco shop (took an hour off work for it! hehe) and got the Z. My criteria for a mobile hadn't changed, and Sony had released several new waterproof phones, of which Z was one. I've had it almost a month now, and I like it even more than the Acro, and I'd already kept the Acro for almost a year (I'd considered it a keeper)The Good:---------- looks good. Feels good in the hand. However, at 5 inches, the size is starting to seem a little big- well spec'd- good processor and latest Android OS.- Generally good phone- clarity of both listening and speaking and it's external speaker are more than acceptable.- 13mp camera has a lot of features. I don't know if it's the Android software, or Sony's input, but the camera is revamped:** There are buttons for still shot photos and red dotted video button on the screen so you don't have to swop functions through a menu- just press one button and you're done.**If you take a video, there is yet another button next to the stop button which allows you to take a 1 mp pic at the time without stopping the video. You know it's a 1mp pic because the button says \"1mp\".** There is a multi shot option. As far as I can see, there is no limit to how many photos you can take. Today I used it as a helicopter did a flyby and stopped at 139 photos. I don't know if they are full res or not. On the album, you do not see all 139 photos. Instead, you just see a single pic and at the bottom left corner you see a series of rectangles overlapping to indicate it was a series of multishot photos.** at the top you have simple clear buttons for flash, increase/decrease exposure, HDR, Camera shot function- which includes single shot, multishot, panorama, evening etc, and settings. Personally I find HDR to be of limited use as you have to be extremely still to do this. For those who don't know, HDR is a technique to get a sharper better colour/shadow balance and is done by taking 3 consecutive photos- slightly darker, normal and slightly brighter, and then superimposing all three together to get the final HDR photo. It does mean you have to be very very veyr very still, as if you move, at least one photo is now not the same and the final result is blurry. With real world cameras, you'd do HDR ideally by placing your camera, usually a dslr, on a tripod. Good luck getting the same precision handholding your slim Xperia z. I tried it twice and I can't do it.- Have had no problems with browsing. Internet connections are very speedy. I thikn it uses 4G? Not sure about that.- Has a LCD light on the front of the phone to notify you if you've received messages, etc. However, unlike the acro, it does not keep blinking forever until you view your message. It seems to stop after a while- maybe 15 minutes? I have found no options in settings to change the time which the LED light continues to blink, only the colour.- decent battery life. I know some reviewers have been bitching about bad battery life. Well let me tell you, I think it's just fine. I used a Sony Ericsson Arc S before the Acro, and it's battery would be down to 15% after just 6 hours using msg apps only, like whatsapp. I use power save function and when you go to screen save or it turns off, data stops as well. In addition, you can manually stop data exchange yourself. It makes a big difference. If you let the phone continually exchange data- browsing, chatting etc, then the battery can decrease by as much as 1% a minute. But when you turn it off, it may take an hour on standby to drop 1%. You can view the % on the new versions of Android.- Waterproof. I have taken it into the shower a couple of times to keep chatting. Yeah yeah yeah...showing off :)- 5 inches is a very useful size. It is sharp, colourful and I've had no problem with the capacitive part.The Not so Good:----------------- I suspect it's more because of Android than Sony, but the predictive text is just nuts. it no longer gives words based just on those you typed, but a whole host of other words too, regardless of whether or not you typed them. And there is no working dictionary. In theory, there is a very unwieldy way to do it, by going to setting;language and input;personal dictionaries. You then press Add, and input your word or (for me) acronyms. In reality, even though I've entered the word, it doesn't appear in the list of word options. Crazy.- The top of the screen shows icons of apps being used or messages received eg by whatsapp, sms, gmail, etc. However, they are all only in grey. In the Arc S, they were all different colours, so it was easy to see what app had received a message. Now you have to squint more to see the tiny icon shape.- Unlike the Acro, the Z does NOT come with a charging dock, just a ubs cable. This is not good because it means you have to peel open the catch for it, and that means everytime you do that, the seal of the latch becomes just that tiny teeny bit less solid a seal, which, in turn, reduces the waterproof aspect of the phone. I have bought a charging dock from a third party online- awaiting it now.- Have to remove any covers you've put on in order to put it in said charging dock.- This is a minor thing, but it's a bit too symmetrical for me. I often take it out of my bag upside down because there are no obviously physically distinguishing sides, unlike the Arc S.Overall, should you buy this phone?If you want a waterproof phone, then definitely yes!If you are looking for a normal touchscreen phone, then it's defintely worth a look! It has decent features, is well made and has good holdability, good speakers, battery life and is attractive.If you've made it to the end, then thanks for reading!", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good water resistant smartphone - changing review: DON'T BUY", "Author": "LUIS C SANTINI", "ReviewID": "R38154M8ET8JRT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My previous review was: \"Fast, responsive. Battery could be better (after using a Note II it is hard to level down). Screen color reproduction is not the best. But if you want something you don't need to worry about dust and water and don't wanna use a defender case, this is the only option available.\"And I could actually say the camera is awesome too. BUT, after 7 months of use I can only say: DON'T BUY. Sony's customer service is TERRIBLE.The phone itself never presented any major problem until, after regular use plugging and unplugging the charger, the micro usb connector started to bounce. It was loose and suddenly it simply pop out of the phone, attached to the recharger cable. Obviously, after that the phone couldn't be charged anymore.Sony was contacted and said this is not on warranty. Like you would open the latch and try to break this apart on purpose. But not only that. they don't even have a place where they could examine what happened to provide a solution. First the attendant said I would need to pay 185 USD and the phone should be shipped to a place in Texas to be repaired. But then she contacted her supervisor and they told me this problem doesn't have any solution so, basically, after 7 months of regular use you have to throw your 650 USD phone away... Just because you had to plug and unplug the charger. that's it...Tried to talk with the supervisor (52 minutes on a call), after all, this situation is RIDICULOUS. He was busy in another call and promised to call me back. Never happened. they simply don't care...So, do your self one huge favor and stay away of the XPERIA line. They are actually decent devices but if anything goes wrong the company simply has no structure to provide any service.Additional update: the micro USB connector in this phone is a bad design.

I went to the local SONY service center this lunch time in Bangkok and despite the \"Global Warranty\" they tell me they cannot fix it as they only have parts \"for Thai phones\". So what am I supposed to do? That is my problem apparently. I asked to see the supervisor but he would not meet me. Obviously SONY have no business making phones or supporting customers.

And when she was good, she was very, very good, but when she was bad, she was horrid.\"This device is like that little girl.  I bought it because of the design and the waterproof case.  These are perfect.But what they don't tell you in the reviews is that Sony's software is terrible, and the radios in the phone are no good.  I had to switch carriers, and their coverage is worse than they'll tell you, and this device can't even use the coverage that is there.  It's the worst of three phones that I've used in my house.  It'll show three bars of signal, but then when you try to make a call, it will say \"no coverage\" and fail to connect.  It has \"wifi calling\", but that doesn't work half the time, either.  Again, it will say it's connected, but fail when you actually try to use it.Sony's software is pretty much unchanged from 5 year's ago.  It wasn't up to iTunes standard then, and now is just pitiful.  And there are five different music and video players to choose from, each unable to play the other ones' media.If you want a cool toy to impress your friends, this is definitely one.  If you want a robust, useful tool that is also brilliantly designed, this one fails.

In my formative years as a student, the biography of Mr Akio Morita, Made in Japan, was my inspiration of sorts, for thinking \"out of the box\" and for delivering consistent Quality. I still remember the day I bought my first \"Walkman\", Oh what a feeling! Then I went on to buy music systems, Televisions, Cordless phones, countless floppy disks, even more CDs and DVDs, my first and only PSP and so on and so forth of only Sony. Despite of all this I somehow had never bought a Sony Mobile phone and a Cybershot camera, but when you launched the `Xperia Z' with the tag line, `The best of Sony in a smart phone' it got me interested infact really interested when you guys made it water resistant. Let me tell you now that I am a Chef and so far almost all my mobile phones have, at some time or the other been adversely affected because of the fact that I sweat a lot. Now I had a phone which would solve this problem and as it is I was looking for a future ready phone which can replace my Blackberry. To top all this I was getting the Amazing Cybershot technology in a 13 MP Full HD Camera which came in the Xperia Z. Now I am also an avid amateur Photographer, I do a lot of food photography with my DSLR. But it is not possible to carry one around in my kitchens all the time because of its bulk. Well Xperia Z solved that problem also for me, and what got me even more excited was the fact that I can do a lot of experimentation with my photography making full use of the phone's water resistant properties. I had done a lot of research on the net before taking the plunge into buying this phone (I was considering the Samsung Galaxy S4, the HTC One and the Iphone 5). I saw demos and videos of the phone in exhibitions where the phone was dunked in water, slammed to the ground, scratched and brutalized in un-imaginable ways. There was even on shop in some country where they had a beautiful model in a shower cubicle having a bath and talking on the phone. Boss this was very impressive!! So I took the plunge and bought the phone, I even waited for 15 days to get the Black color piece. During that fortnight the Samsung Galaxy S4 was launched, I was not and still am not impressed with that phone, for me Xperia Z had everything that I wanted. Finally I got that phone on 22nd of March 2013. I was smiling all the way home from the Croma Shop in Fort, Mumbai from where I purchased the phone. It really is a remarkable phone, and I am a total gadget freak. In just a few days I knew more about the Android OS than my friends who have been using it for the past few years, thanks to the fantastic Sony Interface. On the first day itself I did what most Xperia Z phone owners would do, I did the \"Water Test\". I felt again like the 14 year old who had bought his first Sony \"walkman\", now I had a Walkman, Cybershot and Android all in one sexy Package. Thank you Thank you Thank you for this wonderful wonderful thing.> But now the Fairytale ends. Two weeks back I had gone on a vacation with my family to Goa and on the first day itself the phone stopped working. I did take a short video of my children in the pool with some water splashing on the phone. It has become a habit for me that when ever I would take the phone in my hands I would automatically press all the port doors to make sure that they are closed firmly even though I had not opened any one of them. Well I took the photos and kept the phone in the bag. After an hour or so I tried to see the photos but the screen would not come on, I tried to hard boot the phone and the screen did come on but switched off immediately. My wife could see my face going white. I immediately opened the ports and I saw \"red\". The water indicator strips had turned red. The phone didn't switch on at all for the entire trip. After I came back to Mumbai, the first thing I did was to take the phone to the Authorized Service centre at Mumbai Central, Digicomp Complete Solution Ltd. The lady behind the desk straight away said that the warranty of the phone is voided as the phone has got water ingress damaged so the phone will not be replaced. Well I know the fine print of the terms and condition did mention that, but some how I feel cheated with that remark. My whole criterion behind buying the phone was its water resistant feature. If you have the means to check your surveys which I was asked to fill up twice through the Sony Privilege app on the phone, the reason for buying this phones have been the brand SONY, the cyber shot and the water resistance feature. Well this was not the end of my woes, the lady at the counter went on to say that their service centre is not authorized to open the phone and they can only try to repair it with some software. Another customer was being handed back his Xperia Z phone which also had water damage saying that his phone is beyond repair. His phone was only a month old. He was pleading to repair the phone even if it costs money. But he was told that nothing can be done. This really was scary. A phone which claims to be water resistant gets water damaged and is irreparable!! Well I was also told the same thing, I also requested that please try to repair the phone. But alas I also got the same reply yesterday after more than a week that my phone cannot be repaired. I was told by the service centre people that I will have to pay 80% of the market value of the phone and I will be given a new phone, do you actually think someone will spend almost INR 30,000/- again on a phone which is flawed? On the sly one of the employees of the centre told me that the phone can be repaired in the grey market easily. What are you people doing? Three weeks back the Xperia Z Ultra was launched in Mumbai at the Taj Mahal Hotel. I am a chef at this same hotel. I met the representatives of Sony there thanking them for the brilliant Xperia Z they had introduced. I was the first person to buy this phone in Taj and now on my recommendation there are at least 10 owners in this hotel itself. All this was prior to my vacation when the phone got damaged. I am in half a mind to call some of the media people there whom I knew and tell them about the false information given about the Xperia Z. Your Promos for the Xperia Z Ultra have gone a step ahead and have actually shown a model filming his dog from under the water inside a swimming pool!! God help the people who buy that piece of misinformation and pity them when they have to go thru the distress of realizing that their phone cannot be repaired. To cut the story short, I need help and answers from SONY. Why did you claim for the phone to be something that it is not? As was my first line of this letter, I am and will be a loyal SONY customer, but I want to negate all the people around me who told me after my phone got spoilt that Sony is not a phone manufacturer so I should have never bought a Sony phone. Thankfully I was saved from the trauma of not loosing my data due to the brilliance of Android and the backups I had created online.I am hoping to receive a befitting reply to this letter / request / complain (whatever you may feel this is). If I don't get a reply then I shall be forwarding this letter to my friends in the press, and to the various websites dealing with Sony Xperia Z and my personal blogs and of course to the consumer courts. regards Raghu Deora", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 2013 Phone Ever!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R1PJKMLGAZC2VX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent product, the phone has great characteristics, new features, last Android, very fast functions, great camera, useful and the best of it wateresistant !!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best smart phone ever!!!!", "Author": "Saliss D.", "ReviewID": "R2SRSJJUP92ASD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simply the best.....

On switching on the phone it prompted to register with Vodafone Europe secure phone registry. Things started to look suspicious. Then I found a note inside the box that gave instructions for setting up APN for AT&T; phone network. For T-mobile, that same note said, refer the internet.

At this point I thought I will start using my apps first over the 2G/GPRS phone network. My apps would take on average 2 to 5 minutes to load, which usually loaded in an instant on my Nexus 4 device.

Nice speed.Good video quality.Great Camera.The \"huh\"?These are specifically directed because this is a Docomo version:Many of the icons, system notifications and of the assorted functions are in Japanese. If you don't read Japanese, this may be a small problem. Most of the functions are not critical. Selecting a different language works for the important functions. Selecting autodial functions automatically add Japanese international calling codes to the phone number (which can have unexpected and unpleasant results I would imagine if you don't catch it in time...calling Japan...to your phone bill). Most of the icons I imagine are associated with Docomo, which is the Japanese equivalent of Google. The phone also has Google functions in parallel.The negatives:Android 4.1.2 isn't as advanced as I would have imagined it would be. Its quite similar to the V2. Doesn't seem to be a fantastic upgrade.Call sound quality...too quiet. Slightly muffled. The sound quality is slightly better on the X10, and was much better on the LT18i.Waterproof? Well...the external speaker for phone ringer and application sounds was quite good. Then, while testing out the waterproof claims of the phone. Now the sound on the external speaker is nearly non-existent. Too quiet to be heard from my pocket (which is where it should normally be). Now the external speaker is not quite useless, but close enough while its in my pocket to make the phone useless. No warranty, not that it would cover water damage anyways? So, I have a useless $1200 phone. I had to have the one that wasn't black or white and order it from Japan. I have checked the settings. THe XLoud function doesn't seem to be working. Its activated, but it doesn't change the volume of the phone anymore. For those of you who own one, I made sure the port seals were all in their proper sealed position (but the external speaker is nowhere near any of the open ports). Initially, the external sound quality was SUPERIOR. Now, its way below average.The network coverage on this phone is merely adequate. It seems to have a My Xperia X10 gets and holds signals much better. Somebody mentioned that it doesn't pick up 3G, I never tested that extensively, since my areas don't have great 3G or 4G coverage.Only comes with a 2GB MicroSD. Switched my Xperia X10's 8GB MicroSD with it. (Um...is that an upgrade then?)Uses micro Sim. You might have to upgrade your SIM...I wasn't prepared for it. I had to wait an extra week for a new SIM. I resisted my friend's recommendations to just \"cut\" the standard SIM. :)Overall, I am pissed that I am dealing with a phone that's external sound quality is now poor. If it gets better when it dries out, I'll update this review. However, I won't trust the waterproof nature of the phone again, even if it does \"come back to life\".Update: It dried out. External speaker is working fine again...Still have to ask...if its waterproof, why does it stop working?Update2: I would also like to say that the battery life on this phone is far superior to any Sony-Ericsson I've owned before. Whatever they did is fantastic. Normally, I could go one to two days between charges on the phone. Two to Three on the LT18i. Right now, the XperiaZ is running about nine days between charges.

First of all the rubber seals on the flaps covering the power and headphone jacks (to make the waterproof) are defective. They wear out extremely rapidly and often fail. So it's not really waterproof. Second of all Sony's attitude towards all this. Sony has the worst customer care in America. To get new flaps I would have to send my phone to them and it would take them a month to put new rubber seals on the flaps. Oh and I would pay for shipping and that's not part of the month.
