{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Unlocked is ........unlocked.", "Author": "Frankie Haddocks", "ReviewID": "R38Q1P5OM21VIP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I live in the Caribbean and ordered an unlocked white 64Gb iphone 4S. The phone,however, was not unlocked. I responded the second day I received my total order from Amazon (I had ordered other items). The seller was at first sarcastic about the time it took for me to notice that the phone was not unlocked, but changed his tone when I provided a link from DHL showing the date I received my total order in the Caribbean. I refused to returned the phone, because restocking fees alone would have cost me $ 200.00. I decided to keep it, jailbreak it when one becomes available and give it to my wife. The seller claims that additional information was given about the phone. I spend two days reading all the details about this seller, plus the comments and ratings from previous customers. It was alot of money that I was going to spend and I was very careful. The information was clear, I was buying an unlocked phone. Sellers should read the Apple site where unlocked is.........unlocked which means one can use their iphone anywhere in the world with a GSM sim card. In the meantime I have bought an unlocked iphone on the island where I live and of course it works, because it's UNLOCKED.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Battery / Hardware problems do exist", "Author": "VeryTechSavy", "ReviewID": "R2YBK8TT285P19", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I whole-heartedly agree with other comments regarding poor battery life.  Apple rates the I-4S with 200 hours in standby.  I have had my phone for 20 days as of today.  Ten days ago I informally tested the battery life over the weekend.  With mild use, and all available services turned on, it took 72 hours to drop to 10%.  Four days ago, after removing it from the charger, (100%), it went to 10% in four hours, the entire time in standby. Yesterday, it went from 100% to 50% in two hours of standby.  Since this was the beginning of my workday, and I did not have a second charger available, I disabled everything.  This prolonged the eventual death another 6 hours.  During the entire 8 hours, I had 2 phone calls which both lasted less than 1 minute.  Installed the patch last night.  Used the phone today, again with very mild use.  It may last 24 hours, but not likely.  The tech that I talked with at Sprint last night, said that my symptoms were identical to all the complaints they have received so far.  Phone works great for a couple of weeks, and then dies a dramatic death.  It's easy to tell when things are going wrong.  The external surface becomes very hot to the touch, even in standby, and you can watch the battery percentage drop 1% every couple of minutes.  This is a very obvious hardware issue.  If I weren't beyond the 14-day return policy that Sprint conveniently implemented just before the Iphone launch, I would have returned it immediately.  Went to the Apple store tonight, as the Sprint tech said that they would need to run diagnostics on the phone, and there were over 100 people waiting in line with the same problem.  There were staff members at the entrance taking names for a waiting list, and there were people waiting outside just to get their name on the \"waiting list.\"  My advice to other users... if you can return it, do so immediately!!  If you don't currently have one and you really want one.  Wait six months for the hardware fix that Apple will surely, and silently make without admitting the severity of this problem.  Realistically, I hear \"class-action suit\" in the background.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "It is not brand new in the box", "Author": "Ardy", "ReviewID": "R1J239WF8084HT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yes it has box, but the box is belong to iphone 4BummerThe serial number is not same on your phone with the one on the boxCheck the serial number on apple site and no warranty from AppleMy guess the phone is refubrishedAnd im just to lazy to return this thing back to the sellerBe careful before u buy apple product on amazonFrom this experience it is better to buy it from authorized reseller", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPhone only, not accessories.", "Author": "Tassio", "ReviewID": "R3CGI79ZNDJEZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered one of this, the iPhone is very good and as it says on description.But the accessories are not original.Also, I paid for the 1day delivered and it came within 3 days.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible!

TERRIBLE BATTERY", "Author": "justsomeguy", "ReviewID": "R9IC3NBU3DNRM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have Verizon and I had a Droid Incredible. It was garbage. For all it's touting all these incredible apps, they never worked. Netflix? I was so excited to get that on my HTC Incredible but - always loads/buffering even with a good 3G signal makes it impossible to use. The buttons wore out over time - I can't turn it off/on or make the screen sleep anymore. And battery life - even with brand-new batteries, MAYBE lasted a day with normal use. Garbage.-So, I have received my new iPhone 4S, 64 Gig thing.  I know there are a million reviews and opinions out there, so let me tailor my comments for the Verizon/Droid -> iPhone user.---First things you notice:1) It's a much nicer design.  The stainless steel bezel.  The flat back and front.  It's heavier, which is OK. The buttons feel very SOLID.  I like that very much. There's an actual SWITCH on the side to make the phone quiet (it will also stop it from vibrating if you set it up in Settings under Sounds (not vibrate?)).2) While the interface is nice, it's not as intuitive as a Droid system.  You can't say, create or download an app that changes the screen brightness or volume levels.  You can't download a shortcut widget/app to like turn wifi on and off.  With the iPhone, it's Apple's way, or the highway.  If you want to turn bluetooth off, you have to go into settings and look for it.  No shortcuts here, my friend.3) Updating your contacts.  When I first got my iPhone, because I'm on Verizon, I had to download their stupid VZ Contact Transfer app.  It wouldn't work.  And by that I mean when I went to search for something on the app store, I got the error \"No Matches\".  This was incredibly frustrating.  I tried not to freak out, and the next day, it worked just fine.  I was able to find and download apps and updated my contacts, etc.  So, if you have this problem, be patient, it will resolve itself.4) The keyboard ROCKS.  I can type MUCH faster on this touch-screen phone.  It's great.  And even though the auto-spell feature only offers one alternative to what you're typing, I either usually need that word or ignore it since I'm typing so fast (correctly) anyhow.5) Siri is fun.  I was cooking and needed to know how many tablespoons were in a cup.  I asked Siri, she told me 16.  Boom.  Easy.  It's a fun feature on this phone that I like and find entertaining.---It's smooth.  It works.  It's solidly constructed.  I've learned to turn off Siri and Bluetooth and Wifi to save battery life.  I've found apps that I wanted and downloaded them and gotten them to work. I'm a little disappointed that you can't download apps to like, change the screen brightness or turn wifi off and on.  It's either Apple's way or not at all.  I've gotten used to it.  Call quality (strange that it's the LAST thing I mention on a PHONE!) is passable.  Do people still TALK on phones anymore?----------** UPDATE **I can't get the battery to last a day.  I've done all the tricks I've read about online: turning off all kinds of sensors and Siri and stuff.  Still, if I just use the phone for like an hour, the battery drops dramatically.  It's at like 20% now and all I've done was run an app or two and maybe check Facebook once or twice.  It's garbage.  I'm bringing this to an Apple store to see if they will replace it.  I think it's totally weak they would release this product, claim it has excellent battery life, only to have it die every day no matter what I do.-----** UPDATE **It's been awhile and I still think the battery blows.  Basically, you can't use SIRI, leave your GPS on, leave your Bluetooth on, leave your wireless internet on, or leave anything running in the background.  Using your phone for what it's intended (all the glorious features it brags about such as Siri, bluetooth, etc) just utterly destroys your battery.  I hardly use my phone at all.  I quickly check it during the day for things, maybe play a game or send texts, maybe use it at the gym, and it's just about dead by the end of the day.  It's a joke.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "False advertising", "Author": "marcia", "ReviewID": "R13DQWA07J51EC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This I phone 4s 64 GB was advertise as brand new.--I called apple to register my phone, apple said the phone was 2 years old.

Apple still has no way to delete mass emails even though we have all requested it or least help with this issue they have created for us. Voice search still needs tweaked.
