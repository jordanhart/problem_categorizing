These phones have a slot for micro sd cards (up to 32gb) to expand memory and it's just about mandatory to buy a micro sd card to add more memory because pre-loaded bloatware on these phones take up most of the phone's built-in memory.  If the micro sd card had been included in the purchase, this product would be rated 5 stars.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Moving to another manufacturer", "Author": "Jarna", "ReviewID": "R1F41UTXB5UTD1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was very excited about this phone. Got it and I loved it. I have had it for three weeks now and I'm ready to sell it.I has very little internal memory so I have to keep clearing caches and deleting stuff to do anything: view my gallery pictures or play music. Since I got it, it has never been recognised by HTC Sync no matter what I try. The Facebook button also never worked. It keeps asking me to authorise the button but I just keep coming up with a deleted or moved page on the internet. Forums havent been able to help and support has never responded to me. This was my first foray into HTC and I've had enough.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0057SJ9ZM"}}
