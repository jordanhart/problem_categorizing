{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Great, Inexpensive, Unlocked Android Phone.", "Author": "PR58TP5784", "ReviewID": "R34GW0GURB8KY4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for something to replace my old Android 2.3 phone but didn't want to spend alot; plus, I wanted to stick with prepaid service and have the freedom to switch carriers as prices for data changes. This phone was my choice. Having used it for a few days I think it's was well worth the 149.99. It is definitely cheaper plastic construction, but still feels solid at the same time having a decent weight to it. If you're looking for a super light phone you'll want to look elsewhere. The screen looks great and is fast and responsive. The near-stock Android Jellybean runs nicely and the quad-core processor handles most tasks with ease. Camera could be better. Blu includes a silicone case in the box which you'll need because it is super slippery without it. It also comes with a screen protector, headphones, USB cable, and wall adapter.This is a smart alternative to spending a ton of money for a name brand Android phone or getting locked into contracts.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "This mobile phone highly exceeded my expectations", "Author": "M.

But after reading your good reviews and ratings I said why not risk purchasing a phone from you. I've had my phone for exactly a week and I LOVE IT! Since its unlocked I was afraid it wasn't going to be able to be activated, which definitely wasn't the case. This phone is refurbished but yet looks brand new. It came with a new screen protector, case, charger and phone box. I love the size, it's about half an inch taller than the Galaxy 4s. I've received many compliments! I'm one happy customer.
