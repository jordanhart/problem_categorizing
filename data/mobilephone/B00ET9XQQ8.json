{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good phone for the basic user", "Author": "V. Lockwood", "ReviewID": "R2R1S3TWVBUVNR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I decided to switch from Virgin Mobile to prepaid T-Mobile, my phone choices were a bit limited, because I didn't want to spend a lot of money for the phone.  There were only a few in the $200-250 range.  I looked at the LG L9, but it was too big for my front pocket.  I also liked that this F3 had a bit of a faster processor, LTE capability, and that big battery, so I decided on this F3 and I am, for the most part, pleased with it for what I paid.I have had this phone for 3 weeks now and I actually gone 2 days on a battery charge a few times.  If I am at 60% or so at bedtime, I will keep the phone off the charger until it gets down to around 30%, and then charge it.  Sometimes, if the usage has been light, it can hold out until the 2nd night.  The screen is good, the processor, being a dual-core 1.2 GHz, is okay for light gaming, and LG gives you a lot of ways to customize, with different themes, fonts, lock screens, etc.  Of course, the phone does have drawbacks, you couldn't get a budget phone that had everything perfect, right?  :)There are a couple of little things...speaker is weak, and I sometimes cannot hear it in the next room.  I wish the front camera was a little better.  But what really concerns me is that it has a small amount of storage.  I am glad that I have a Kindle Fire 2nd gen that I use for most things, and therefore I keep just a few apps and games on this phone.  The good thing is, with the Android 4.1.2, I am fine with the stock launcher, messaging app, camera app, etc.  So, for me there is no need to use up the small amount of storage I have by installing 3rd party apps, something I had to do in the past if I wanted increased functionality.  Still, even with that, right now, I have about 432 Mb available...not very much, I know.  It does have a micro SD slot for music, videos, etc., but the changes to Android with the Jellybean version prevent you from storing apps on the SD card...something I could do on my old Gingerbread phone.  I have been thinking about rooting the phone to get around this, but I have never done it before and I keep reading about the possibility of bricking the phone.  So for now, I am trying to be conservative about what I install on the phone.The LTE coverage where I am is very fast.  I tested that at the T-Mobile store before I bought this phone, and it does not disappoint.  I am currently on the $60 plan, where you get 2.5 Gb of high speed 4G (LTE if it is in your area), and then the phone drops down to 2G until the next month starts.  (As an aside, the 2G is actually faster than the supposed 3G that I had with Virgin Mobile, so for the most part, I am very much happy with the 2G!)  Three weeks into my plan, and I have only used 1.7 Gb of the 2.5 allotted to me.All in all, this is a good phone with lots of functionality if you are okay with the storage limitation.  I would recommend it to a casual user who likes to play a simple game now and then, perhaps would use the camera for the quick shot now and then, but who is more concerned with the actual phone and messaging aspects.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best $49 4G LTE Smartphone Of 2014", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R3I91IOGSN9SJC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The LG Optimus F3 is a first: a small and light 4G LTE phone that combines ultra-high speed 4g LTE with fast HSPA+ data speeds.  Now you can enjoy Netfix videos on your lunch hour.T-Mobile is selling the LG F3 for the amazing price of $49 at T-Mobile's expanding network of neighborhood MetroPcs stores and at the MetroPcs website.  Prepaid customers at MetroPcs get an extra 20% discount on monthly service compared with T-Mobile's regular prepaid monthly fee.  MetroPcs customers enjoy unlimited use of the T-Mobile network for just $40 a month including all taxes and fees.The T-Mobile LG F3 delivers consistently fast data speeds in 70% of America's largest cities because it connects to both T-Mobile's new 4G LTE network and also to their very fast HSPA+ 3G network.NOTE: The T-Mobile coverage map lets you enter your zip code and zoom in to see the quality of the 4G coverage on your block.Outside of major cities, the LG F3 will get bumped down to T-Mobile's 2G Edge network. The T-Mobile 2G network is often faster than the Sprint 3G network my old phone used, and it is fast enough for email, news and streaming Pandora Radio.The F3 has an sharp four inch screen in a compact body weighing just four ounces, similar in size to the Apple iPhone 5. The dual core processor is fast enough for most apps, but not for some 3D action games.Although the LG F3 is one of the smallest 4G LTE phones available, it has a massive battery that lasts 50% longer than the average smartphone. It is possible to go 24 hours on a charge unless you are using GPS or streaming videos. If you are streaming videos over 4g LTE or navigating with GPS, you can consume 25% of your battery charge in just an hour.The front speaker sounds good indoors but is a bit too quiet for a noisy environment. Turning on noise cancellation helps. The rear speaker works well as a speakerphone but is only adequate for music. With good ear buds, music sounds great.The camera takes good photos in bright sunlight, but is mediocre in dim light and indoors. Videos are okay, but not great.WEAKNESS: Only a TINY 1.2gb of internal memory is available after you update the pre-installed apps such as Google Maps.To free  internal memory: for each app you do not use, go into \"settings\", to \"apps\", select \"all apps\" and look for apps using more than 1mb of memory that you never use. Uninstall the updates, unselect notifications and then delete or disable the app.Apps most people do NOT use include Google+, Google Books, Google Magazines, Google Movies, Google Music and the Chrome browser app. Removing the updates and disabling those apps frees 200 megs of memory.Install a 16gb or 32gb sd card to hold your music and photos. Some large apps, such as Netflix, can be moved to the SD card.An oval LED light around the home button changes from red to green when the F3 is fully charged. The light blinks when you have an unread text or email.CASES: Most LG F3 cases on Amazon are for the Sprint/Virgin 720 version and do NOT fit the T-Mobile/MetroPCS MS659 version.Search Amazon for \"case MS659\" or visit a T-Mobile or MetroPCS store to get a case guaranteed to fit. The Body Glove Dimensions case is slim, light and fits precisely.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great android phone in a small package", "Author": "Tracy", "ReviewID": "R3ATJWVFPYJARU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What attracted me to this phone most were two things; the size and android (also the price).  I needed a phone that I could keep in my pocket (with a case on it) and not feel like I'm carrying a tablet in there.  I used to have a blackberry curve 9360, and I loved the size of the phone and the QWERTY keyboard, but Blackberry just doesn't have much for apps, and they are slowly losing app support from google.  Also they don't do activesync email which was a problem for my work.  I couldn't find any other android phones (that work with Tmobile) in this size category (similar to an iphone size).The performance of this phone is very fast for day to day use (I'm not a gamer), and of course Android is awesome.  I will say that with the smaller screen it is more difficult to type than on my wife's Galaxy SII (I would assume this is the same with Iphones too), but with the auto-correct or SWYPE, it really isn't that bad.  I'm getting faster at typing on it.  The phone does feel \"cheap\", but that really is just because it is so small and so light (relative to other android devices).  Put a case on it and it feels great, I've got big hands and it still fits well.  The screen is very nice.The camera is normal, nothing to write home about it.  For me it gets the job done.  With the addition of an SD card I have no issues with the small amount of memory available.  If you're super paranoid about running out of application memory the phone can be rooted and you have options for storing apps on the SD card.  My wife's samsung came with much more bloatware than LG put on this guy, so no complaints there.All in all I'm very happy with the purchase, especially for $199.Update 9/23/2013After having this phone for a few weeks, I love it even more.  It really is fast, the LTE is blazing fast when I have it, and the battery lasts forever.  I love the smaller size of this phone, and have completely gotten used to typing on it normally, and with Swype typing (and I have big hands and fingers).  There is definitely a bug with Swype with the stock LG keyboard (noted in other LG phone reviews) where it deletes the second word every time, but I just downloaded the google keyboard, and it works awesome.  Not sure what other people want that this phone doesn't have, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.  The camera really is decent, and the panoramic shot this camera does is really fantastic.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not premium but a good compromise", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R310GN4ZJ4SXL3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My most recent T-Mobile devices have been an SIII and the LG L9.  With the exception of LTE the SIII was superior in every way so this review will focus on the comparing the F3 to the L9.  I got mine on here on Amazon for $199 but I've seen the price since come down to $188 on two occasions.  The F3 has a slightly lower resolution but the smaller screen makes up for this.  The processor is faster at 1.2GHz vs 1.0GHz and is noticeable.  It won't blow your doors off but day to day you'll notice the slight lag between similar tasks get smaller.  Available space is the same but thats not saying much as I ran into space problems with the L9 and was never able to get it rooted (too difficult).  I've read some people have gotten the F3 rooted via motochopper which makes me optimistic.  I will try this method and update when complete.  As for the battery, there's a lot of talk about the battery size vs the screen size and how it should result in better life.  To be honest, I'm only seeing a couple more hours of additional use but I have a heavy user with lots of screen time and data use (unlimited).  HSDPA is very power efficient versus LTE and that's becoming apparent with the F3.  The main drawback of the L9 was the inclusion of a 21Mbps radio vs the 42Mbps the SIII had.  To me 42Mbps felt as fast as Verizon LTE.  I would frequently see 10-15Mbps in the Chicagoland area which is more than enough to be usable and I would have been happy to keep the SIII.  Due to marketing necessities T-Mobile had to move to LTE.  The day T-Mobile began reframing in Chicago I saw my HSDPA speeds drastically drop and my latency skyrocket epically in the Loop.  I've been told these are not related but I doubt it and was very unhappy with my service.  The move onto LTE via the F3 has been refreshing and I now have good data service again at my office.  For me this device is a place holder until the Nexus 5 comes out or I pull the trigger on LG G2 or the Sony Z1 (I need a big battery but don't want a phablet).  These mid range devices like the F3 and L9 save money but they make a lot of sacrifices.  For example, the F3 still doesn't have an auto screen dimmer like every other premium device out there.  With the inclusion of LTE, notification light, larger battery and more comfortable size there is no reason to consider the L9 over the F3.  I would recommend going with a more premium device over the F3 but if funds or something else is holding you back the F3 is a good compromise.Update, 9/30/2013.  Rooting via motochopper method was easy and done in less than five minutes.  The removal of Lookout probably helped the most.  If you search for \"root LG F3\" the results should come up on the first page and are dated 8/18/13.Update 10/7/2013.  The GPS at times seems to get confused causing the pointer arrow (within Google maps) to change directions or even report me being on the wrong street.  This usually happens when I'm driving slowly or stopped and seems to go away when I start moving again.  I haven't had this happen on my other devices and LGs track record of updating leads me to believe this won't get corrected.Update 10/30/2013.  The tiny amount of storage space on this phone is killing me.  I find myself clearing out the cache on Chrome, Currents, ect, a couple times a week.  Even 4Gigs would have been better.Update 11/18/2013.  The \"email\" app on this phone which is used to sync all non gmail accounts seems to only work over WIFI.  GPS problems persist.  I did start moving my apps to the SD card which has marginally helped with the storage issues.Update 12/13/2013.  2 updates have come out in the past week.  These are the first since owning the phone.  Neither broke the root but it also doesn't seem like they did anything as I'm still on 4.1....Update 12/22/2013.  1 more update since the last but I still don't see any decernable differences.  This will be my last update as I purchased a Moto X.  Comparatively the Moto X has much worse battery life but a nicer screen, faster processor and far more storage.  I guess I didn't realize how good the battery life was on the LG F3.  Don't underestimate it.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great entry level smartphone", "Author": "OSU_Engineer", "ReviewID": "R2WPMO4TOFGJPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To preface, I am a power Android user who uses a Google Nexus 4 as a primary smartphone. In the last two months, I have purchased an LG Optimus L9 (the precursor of this phone) for my fianc\u00e9, and this Optimus F3 for my sister.The phone comes in the same pre-paid, off-the-shelf look as if it were purchased in Best Buy, and it includes a Micro-SIM card for pre-paid activation. However, the phone is only locked to T-Mobile's network, so activating a post-paid account with the phone worked just fine as well. The setup is fairly painless, with the prerequisite Google account to download contacts, settings etc. Coming from a stock Android experience, this build is a little heavy with bloatware apps, especially T-Mobile's services and things like mobile security. However, for a new smartphone user, you would probably not even notice.Despite only having 1GB of RAM, the phone is very responsive even with several apps running in the background. The LTE is quick, and T-Mobile has a preconfigured notification telling you how much data you have used. Speaking of preconfigured notifications, if you use all of the Q-settings from LG and the T-Mobile reports and the virus scan reports, you will have virtually no room on the 4 inch screen for the actual notifications such as texts and missed calls. I would highly recommend disabling some of the stock notifications.Aside from the user interface, the hardware is very nice. Having a 4 inch screen in a land of 5 inch monsters is very good for those with small hands or pockets. People coming from an iPhone or iPod touch will be right at home with size. The phone is small and light, but packs a HUGE battery (2460 mAh vs 2100 mAh in even a Nexus 4). That combined with the fairly small screen and dual core processor should yield amazing battery life. The notification light around the home button is a much needed improvement over the L9. The camera is not the selling point of this phone, but using tap-to-focus will make pictures usable.As a last point, make sure when shopping for cases to find products for the T-Mobile variant (MS659 model number). The other model for Virgin Mobile has four rounded corners, so the cases will not fit. Overall, this will make a perfect phone for non-power users who need an off-contract phone for T-Mobile. It won't hold a candle to a Galaxy or iPhone, but at 1/3 of the price, that is to be expected. Get this phone and a Simple Choice plan, and you will save lots of $$$.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of the Best Values in Android 4.x.", "Author": "ZeeZee", "ReviewID": "R1P0MV1CM7AOCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's not the fastest.  It's not the highest resolution.  It doesn't have the most memory.  But it's one of the few Android 4.x phones that people can buy outright and still put money away for more important things than a phone.This phone needs to be reviewed for what it is;  An economical Android 4.1.2 phone that will run all of your apps and meet the needs for most people.I personally use an HTC One, and came from an HTC EVO 4G.  This phone is my wife's new phone.  It seems to be tucked somewhere  in between the other two phones that I mentioned.  It's more sophisticated than the EVO, with twice as much main memory, faster CPU with two cores, and a more modern Android OS, yet it's not nearly as expensive or feature-rich as other phones.As a value phone, this seems like a 5-star device.  Clean out and disable most of the included junk apps and free up several hundred MB and improve battery life with fewer running services.  Don't expect it to have the quality or features of a phone that costs 2-3 times as much, and you should be pleased.  Most other products in this category are Window phones or have older hardware and older versions of Android.Be aware that T-Mobile's posted specs are inaccurate.  It does not have Android 4.2.  LG's site has accurate specs.  Having used both 4.1 and 4.2 on my Nexus 7, the main differences here will not impact most phone users.  The greatest feature change in 4.2 was the multi-user support for tablets.  You can still have gesture typing and an improved notification bar with some of the LG  enhancements that come out of the box.It's entirely utilitarian and lacks the sexy features and build quality that phone snobs may want, but it seems that it will serve most people well.  Pair this with T-Mobile's cheap no-contract unlimited + 500 MB data plan, and it's a win for people who want a decent smartphone on the cheap.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what I needed", "Author": "Colin K. Smith", "ReviewID": "R1SWA7GL3DOKEW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't normally write reviews, but this phone has definitely inspired me to.  I needed to make the leap to a smart phone and one specifically that would make use of T-Mobile's LTE network since I live in an area where it has been rolled out.  I don't particularly like large phones and cannot see paying $400-600 for such a device.  I wanted something that would allow for High-Speed (3G+/4G)data when necessary, but also allow me to restrict my data usage to 2G AND allow for Wi-Fi calling while at home.  I also needed an Android based phone running ICS (or better) so that I could download apps from the Google Play store to side-load on my Amazon Kindle HD tablet. The LG Optimus F3 (MS659) met all of these requirements.The F3 is small enough to put in a shirt or pants pocket.  It also has an insanely long battery life (24 hrs of moderate usage only reduced the battery to 17% and 36 hrs of light usage still left the battery with a 37% charge!!!)  The default setting with the T-Mobile F3 is Wi-Fi calling first and then cell network calling when no Wi-Fi is available.  I make sure when I am home to turn off the GPS and when I go out to turn off the Wi-Fi unless I am using them.  The 1.2MHz processor is plenty fast enough for my needs as I do not game on the device and rarely stream videos on it.  Perfect for music from Pandora or I Heart Radio.The biggest downside is the lack of internal memory.  You NEED a micro SD card to use with this device.  I transferred a 16GB device from my old phone and have found that to work perfectly.  The T-Mobile does come with a fair amount of bloatware (much of which cannot be removed without rooting), BUT some of the apps you install CAN be moved to the SD card (go Apps > Settings > Storage > Apps > Move to SD Card).Another concern is finding a good case or skin since, as other reviewers have stated, the back panel on this phone is very thin.  I chose the Body Glove Dimensions case which provided enough protection without making the phone too bulky.  This item is generally available in either light blue or lavender online but T-Mobile stores also carry it in black.  If ordering online make sure you are getting the one that fits the MS659 model (T-Mobile/MetroPCS) and not the LS720 model(Sprint/Virgin Mobile) as the dimensions are different.PROS:Size, battery life, Wi-Fi calling, speedCONS:Internal memory, limited selection of accessories", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Compact Phone", "Author": "Phyllis", "ReviewID": "R8502OTSHUO45", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I need a cell phone for communication - not for gaming or photos or music or wasting time on social sites.

Davis", "ReviewID": "R3TMH05JZONAM7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I selected this phone for its size and weight.  \"Practical\" for me is something I can keep in my shirt pocket.  It's shorter and lighter then a iPhone with a welcome increase in screen width.Upon my first week of use, I've been pleasantly surprised with its performance.  This is the first digital phone that I can say has sound quality equal or better than a desk phone.  Turning up the volume in a noisy environment, does not result in distortion.  Even music-on-hold, actually sounds like music.Then there is this wonderful LED light behind the \"home\" button.  Messaging applications (like Email) can blink this LED with a specified color to indicate a new message.  I have two Email accounts.  I set one to green and the other is blue.  Text messages are orange.  If the phone is on your desk, for instance, and the light isn't blinking, you do not have a new message.  There is no need to pick up your phone, turn it on and check.  I can't tell you how much time this saves.  I didn't have this feature on my iPhone.  (Until I break the habit, I still find myself turning it on and checking...)The home button has buttons on each side.  The right button, basically \"drills down\" into an application, and the left button, \"drills up\" -or- more commonly, serves as a \"return\" key.  With these three buttons, there is very little need to \"click\" on the screen to navigate around applications.I'm finding that charging every other day is adequate.  If you use WiFi, you may notice that it connects almost instantaneously.  There are places inside my workplace, that do not have sufficient cellular signal, and the phone is set to use \"WiFi calling\" instead.  Great feature!If there is a down side, it would be about a dozen pre-installed \"system\" applications that can't be uninstalled.  I think this is true of most Androids so I'm not going to remove a star for it.  I don't use them now, but maybe some day I will.I've grown to love this phone so much, I bought one for my wife.

Fixing it cost almost as much as a new phone. The new LG F3 was an outstanding upgrade with improvements across the board. Very easy to switch the T-Mobile number to the new phone.

Other models that came out shortly before this one are being left out of the upgrade path to Kitkat.I threw in a 32BG microsd card from Amazon, and it was ready for music, photos, and videos galore.There are oodles of very nice cases on Amazon at excellent prices.

I purchased for my son and had a few glitches with SIM card error and ended up getting it replaced. Amazon as usual was amazing and it was quite painless as I am a Prime member. They sent me a new one and I got to keep the old one until it was received. That is good service in my opinion. I waited to write this review until I made sure the phone had no more issues. It has been great. Battery life is above average for a smartphone, apps and OS is OK for an Android phone, just not my cup of tea. So that being said it is a good phone for the price I suppose. Like my Windows phones way better just simpler, easier to use, integrated Office apps, Skydrive, multiple email accounts setup and just way easier to find everything. That is my one big gripe about Android phones, like going on a fishing expedition every time you need to access a setting or something. So that is just my opinion, if you like Android then this is a good phone and I would not hesitate if you are thinking about purchasing . As long as you are getting this model and not an unlocked model but the actual T-Mobile model you will be happy. It has 4G LTE and all the functionality it is supposed to have. Buyer beware of International versions. Not the same thing ever!! Trust me I have been down that road too many times, please learn from my mistakes.

T-Mobile's wifi calling can be useful inside your house if you can't get a signal there. The small 1.7 GB of memory is annoying, and only some apps can be moved to the SD card. I rooted my phone to get rid of some bloatware, so I freed up a lot of space. The processing is OK, I haven't played many complex games yet. The speakers on the phone are loud, and if you mess around in some apps, you can overheat it. I recommend keeping the volume at 80%.

The 5MP camera and powerful flash takes decent pictures, and if you change the settings, you can get pictures that look like they're from a standalone camera.

It was over 2 years old so it was about time. I was overwhelmed by all the phones available now and a little reluctant to shell out 4, 5, 6 and even 7 hundred bucks on a phone, especially with new models expected in the next couple months.  I also didn't want another long contract. I ended up paralyzed and unable to make a decision so I decided to go for a phone that would be adequate for a few months and could later be used for a travel phone (so I could take my time deciding on a permanent phone) - so not too pricey but smart enough to be useful.I was looking at Blu phones, Samsung, used i phones, etc and trying to stay under $200.I couldn't find anything that seemed perfect and in the end asked the local big box electronics store to recommend a phone and ended up with the F3 For $150.I didn't love the phone right away. It felt very light in my hand and plastic-y. I added a case and it felt a little better. I'm on day 4 now and I really like this phone now. I think it will be my permanent phone!Good points:The battery lasts forever! I have a habit of following fb, texting and checking email frequently as well as googling quite a bit and watching youtube too. I was charging my Pro after 4 hours of use on average. I charge the F3 every other day. Wow.The phone is speedy! It has 4G and it's just as fast as my laptop. I have it on T Mobile with unlimited data so I don't even switch over to wifi at home.Not so good points:The touchscreen keyboard is pretty small and I'm having trouble transitioning from the actual keyboard buttons on my last phone.The screen that shows when you drag down from the top of the home screen is very crowded. It's botherimg me a lot less today than it did on the first day. I will get used to it.Overall I'm very happy with the phone. It does everything I need. I'm not stuck in a 2 year contract and I didn't pay so much that I will be afraid of losing it or dropping it.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awaiting my FOURTH replacement phone.", "Author": "Daniel Olson \"Embrace Innocence\"", "ReviewID": "RUQ9QOM7BDRHG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was my first Android.  I do like some of the features such as the Google voice typing and the size is perfect for most users. I can zoom in on pictures AND text messages with a reverse pinch. The phone boots quickly and has never just shut off on me for no reason. Volume is fair and the screen adjusts automatically for different lighting environments.But it only offers a single notification sound to signal every type of notification. So if i hear my notification sound, I cant be certain if its a reminder, an email, a text, or a voice-mail. It took me forever to figure out the 6 or so steps to employ GPS directions, and if you have big fingers be prepared to make many typing and selection mistakes. Oh and the fact that everytime I want to open a link I have to choose between the browser, google, chrome, and if its a video... youtube. PLUS it will ask me if i want to choose this option just once or every-time. Choosing the \"every-time\" is no guarantee that it wont make you jump through the same hoops next time. A delayed screen shift which occurs often when texting or when you terminate a call, guarantees that what you attempt to select will have dodged your finger a nano second before you touch the screen. Even after setting the screenlock feature I've found my phone put itself on airplane mode, silent, or opened endless applications which bogged the system down until I could only regain control by removing the battery to reset it. O and though the phone is equipped with about 3 picture/photo apps, none of them allows you to move your photos from your camera or gallery to an external SD card. *Face-palm*My first phone developed a few issues after 3 months including a microphone that blinked out when the phone was inverted. Within 3 weeks of arriving, the second phone disabled the microphone everytime i initiated speaker phone. Again.. no one could hear me. The 3rd one has been here for about 4 weeks, and 2 days ago developed several problems simultaneously.  The HOME key no longer functions so the only way to get back to the homescreen menu is to back key, back key, back key, out of whatever I'm doing. The screen timeout no longer works and I have to hit the side button to turn off the live screen. The phone randomly \"wakes up\" as if it sees me or hears something, displaying the lock screen for a few moments before going back to sleep. (this is not a feature that I'm aware of and I cant turn it off) This drains the battery so I have to plug it in several times a day. Many say this is a great \"basic\" phone, but I think its way more complicated than an entry level smart phone needs to be, and the huge number of features simply leaves room for a huge number of malfunctions.... and I'm only at about 6.
