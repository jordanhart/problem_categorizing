Main concern, no microSD card slot. Sound volume is low even at highest setting. This becomes a concern when driving in highways. I have to use a powerful bluetooth speaker. Otherwise this is a great device. I knew the limitations, still bought one. Look at my video review of Nexus 5 Black phone.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don't advertize or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version): 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5\" is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, but after using Note for a while, I don't use it as a primary phone. The display in Nexus 5 is absolutely stunning with a Super AMOLED display and you have to see to feel it! I like it as much as Galaxy S4 and S5.ANDROID UI:Nexus 5 has Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. User Interface has a flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently to my friends shows the details of processes. battery usage like which process takes up more battery and it is geeky and impressive.CAMERA:This can just replace a point and shoot camera. Wait, what is a point and shoot camera?! Very impressive. I use it sometimes, but my Nikon D90 still the workhorse.PROCESSING POWER:Don't bother about it. For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.Qi WIRELESS CHARGING:BIG PLUS on Nexus 5 phones. Very convenient. Period.NFC Tags:Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. Get bunch ( I mean around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example in my S4, when I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both.Micro SD card!!BIG BUMMER. I am so used to SD card and having tons to stuff. I am feling the pain.OTG - USB Hosts:This is also often ignored feature in many reviews. On the GO USB cable + Nexus 5 means you can use with external hard disks, and virtually many of USB devices. If you have a thumb drive and have files, you can in fact read with a phone and don't necessarily have to open a laptop. works out of the box.BATTERY:Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don't. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!MISC FEATURES:GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Look at my video review.To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), TOM TOM, , Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Currents (nice way to read News), Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they have for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google VoiceAsk questions.

Milbourn \"Gaming Wizard\"", "ReviewID": "R2B5ZXZ2M3O14U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Nexus 5 for two months now, and I can confidently say that its the best phone I've ever used, and one of the best phones on the market.  Starting with the build, I have nothing but praise.  It's light, sturdy, and feels great to hold, but unlike many metal phones I've used, it has a feel of durability, which I like.  The screen is brilliant; Large, bright, great viewing angles and some of the most accurate color reproduction available on a phone.  Turn it on, and you're greeted with the most bleeding edge interpretation of Android straight from Google.  I love it, for me it strikes a sublime balance between simplicity and robustness that I haven't felt on an iOS device, or any other android for that matter.  The UI is extremely intuitive and easy to understand, not to mention gorgeous.  But at the same time, you don't sacrifice functionality; you can very quickly customize the N5 to fit your exact usage, yet never feel like you have to jump through hoops to do so.  In my opinion, in its most recent form, Android is far and above the best mobile OS; there's essentially no learning curve with this phone, yet the potential for customization is almost limitless.  In terms of speed, the N5 flies.  Can't say much more than that, over two months of ownership I haven't once longed for a faster phone.  My battery has been great, a quick root and greenify installation lets me freeze apps like Facebook and Google+, and I have no issue reaching 4 hours SOT over a full day on medium brightness.  Lastly, while the camera is often criticized, I have nothing but positive things to say about it; HDR+ mode is great, photos come out accurate and vibrant without sacrificing any fast moving details.  I've taken dozens of fantastic photos; is it the single best phone camera out there? Probably not, but its also far better than the criticism it has elicited.Overall, I love this phone.  If you're a fan of Google and Android, this is your phone.  If you're a casual user not dead set on a platform, I urge you to get your hands on a N5 before you decide.  And even if you're a loyal iOS user, you should pay the N5 at least some consideration.  Google has come an extremely long way with Android, what used to be a clunky system useful only to tech enthusiasts has transformed into an elegant, beautiful, and truly powerful experience.  And there is no better phone to use it on than the Nexus 5.  Add in the fact that it costs half as much as every other flagship phone, and even its harshest critic cannot deny the merits and value of this phone.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best phone, period", "Author": "K.Hemmings", "ReviewID": "RTRQJEVBW13H4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love my new device, works perfectly with one or both hands.The colour was way brighter than I expected but I still love it.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "I bought this phone for my sister , She loves it and Red/ Orange color looks amazing", "Author": "Amit", "ReviewID": "RSAQAFT2JMBHL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my sister , She loves it and Red/ Orange color looks amazing .

The power button sometimes doesn't unlocks the screen, and there is NO OTHER WAY to unlock the screen, the sound for calls is really bad my friends have told me, 16GB is a LIE, I went to settings storage and is only 12gb wow I got so angry because with all the system apps from google and android is only 10gb left to put apps and music. I let myself guide for all the good reviews and when I started having troubles I decided to read the bad reviews and is all that happens to me.If a phone is not even good for receiving calls so is a phone that should never be in the market, also has a terrible signal even my itouch is faster when opening pages on the browser.My advice is be careful when buying something, search a list of flaws on the phone brand you wanna buy and you will get a better idea of what it really is.
