It is pretty quick and nice looking. It runs just about any java app/game that doesn't use features this phone doesn't have. One underrated feature of this phone is the flip over silence. I love that. When you get a call and see a name/number you don't know/like/etc, just flip the phone over to where it is face down and it automatically silences the phone. The LED lights on this phone are a nice touch. The only bad things I have to say about this is that it doesn't play gif files as animated backgrounds and I can't find anymore to download. The other is that the video files must be a certain type (you can easily use the free program Format Factory to get them into that though) and within a certain resolution to play, over wise you get some error or another. Picture quality is pretty good for the price and video quality is fair but it only does low resolutions. Overall I really like this phone a LOT more than my old crappy, annoying, sidekick lx.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG DLite", "Author": "softtofurox", "ReviewID": "R1MLRM3NZI7SYI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good. The product came a day earlier than the expected arrival date. Phone in good condition with all the accessories. Using it with an at&t; sim card and it works perfectly. The secret lighting is awesome since you can customize it for each person. Calls are clear and texting (T9) takes time to get used to if you were previously using a touchscreen keyboard. The only thing is I cannot figure out is how to set up the internet and picture messaging, so beware if you want picture messaging. Otherwise, this phone is excellent if you don't need all the features of a smartphone.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very un-happy about the battery", "Author": "Happy and Lucky", "ReviewID": "R2J9R1WIIIL5AS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone after using a Samsung for years.

The color is nice and the screen is very clear and bright and I love the different themes and pics that come with the phone. However, battery is not what it says on the specs: Up to 5.5 hours of talk time, up to 360 hours (15 days) of standby time. I fully charged the phone on Sat. night and it die on me on Sunday afternoon. Without even a low battery warning (like my old phone). I did not even have time to try any other features yet, I am returning this one..", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Recommended!", "Author": "tinyPrince", "ReviewID": "R1WN32YGF6X8E",

I would definitely recommend it. Overall it's a pretty girly phone, however if you change some of the settings it makes for a cool quirky phone. My only problems with it is that you have to use the headphones that come with the phone, it has no headphone jack. I think a shortcut button to the message center would be nice too, so you don't have to go through the whole menu. The internet runs fast on 3G network.

I waited to really check it out before reviewing. I am not a young person (chronically anyway,(60), my wife would say 16 mentally) and all I wanted was a phone for calls and text. This phone does it all very well at a very good price. I use AT&T;, so all I had to do was insert the SIM and turn it on. Some had reviewed this phone as slow to start up. True...maybe 30 seconds or so. But for me, no problem. It has great reception and headset volume is really good. Speaker phone is also plenty loud. A feature I really liked was the \"Favorites Tabs\" Enter a phone number and their picture, the center button is \"favorites\" then scroll thru the pictures and hit the call button. And if this is the last feature you used, it is on the phone when you open it up. It shows up like a spread stack of cards with the person's picture on them. Scroll left or right to go thru the pictures and hit the green button to call. The camera takes good pictures and the blue tooth works fine. This phone also has a memory card slot (mini-SD).The only problem I had was, I can't send or receive pictures on the ATT network. I have not looked into a fix because it isn't important to me. I stopped into the T-Mobile store before I bought this phone, just to look at it. $178(their price) and I would have to get it unlocked myself. Amazon is a much better deal at $78 already unlocked and free shipping. The phone operating system is fast as well, no lag.

The camera is pretty good too I took some pretty nice pictures yesterday of my boyfriend. the screen is huge in the buttons are my size so it's easy to send messages and browse internet. also I played wIth It all last nIght because of all the personalization :P and today have been textIng and taking photos, only saw one bar go down which Is great because seems lIke battery will last a long time so don't have to charge so much, but not sure about constant phone calls or playing music I don't usually make phone calls anns haven't downloaded any music yet. I would suggest this phone to anyone but maybe not necessarily this buyer only because phone had other ppls numbers amd slight scratch so idk if new.

It's bright blue, lights up, has super twee wallpaper and ring tone options, etc. That said, it's kind of fun! It also took my Samsung sim card seamlessly (I use AT&T;, not T-Mobile). I did lose my pictures, but I suspect I saved them to the phone instead of the sim card or something. My contacts transferred no problem, and the phone sends and receives calls and texts with no issues. The camera doesn't have a flash, so trying to take a pic in a dark room doesn't work out so well, but what true photographer uses a camera phone anyway? I can't speak to the web browser, as I don't have that service.
