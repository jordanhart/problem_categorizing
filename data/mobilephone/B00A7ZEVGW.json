{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for texting and speakerphone sound quality", "Author": "Louisa Filomarino Cauvin", "ReviewID": "RBJSCG0D4Y85M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you do a lot of texting that includes numbers (such as prices), this phone has one of those rare 5 row physical keyboards with numbers across the top row so you don't need to press alt.  Another very useful feature for those who have difficulty hearing cell phone conversations is its speakerphone with an additional  virtual button to make the sound even louder--excellent for noisy environments.I also have a Samsung Galaxy Note phablet with a larger screen than the Relay.  Even though I like the phablet's ultra large screen, it does not have a physical 5-row keyboard.  I do a lot of texting with numbers so I probably will switch back to the Relay.  It's nice to have the numbers at hand when entering passwords, dates, and address numbers in addition to prices.My husband and my son were offered a choice between the Relay and the Note.  They both preferred the Relay.  My son preferred it for the 5-row physical keyboard and my hard-of-hearing husband preferred it for the sound quality.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "my first smartphone", "Author": "follywalker", "ReviewID": "RPV0INB8RE3JT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone.

You get use to the keyboard in the first week, way better than touch typing. Phone arrived brand new sealed only 2 days after purchase from US to Canada (could have been next day after purchase if it weren't for customs). I did have to pay $50 in taxes or something upon arrival though. Great phone!", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Galaxy S Relay", "Author": "rootytooty", "ReviewID": "R6T63RL4RUU5B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cannot tell you how pleased I am with my new phone.
