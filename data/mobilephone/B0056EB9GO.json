Not many people are interested in non-touchscreen phones these days, especially Blackberry, and even more so older models. But the device is a good phone, I've had it in the past, and it's meeting my expectations thus far.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I loved it", "Author": "carissa", "ReviewID": "R2L04YGGRGS6JD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved everything about this phone accept that I needed a Verizon phone and this is a sprint phone. That was my mistake. The seller was awesome and the phone was perfect... except for the whole carrier issue.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Received Sprint 8530 (Purple) appears exactly the same!", "Author": "A. Garg \"dad FACE\"", "ReviewID": "R3K39K54D824KA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this Blackberry CDMA Sprint phone as an upgrade from the 8530 for my daughter's birthday. It was sold from a 3rd party vendor, but fulfilled by Amazon.  The only differnce between the two phones is the amount of RAM.  The 8530 cannot effectively use any OS > ver. 5, while the 9330 with 512 MB onboard memory can use the better BB OS 6.0.The two phones appear identical: it was not until I turned the phone on, and went through the initial setup process did I realize that it was in fact a BB 8530!Bottom Line: Fortunately, Amazon fulfilled the order and gave me an instant refund. If I had bought it from the 3rd party vendor directly, I am sure that the return process would have been much more difficult.  This is the first time in 14 years that I have received the wrong product from Amazon.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0056EB9GO"}}
