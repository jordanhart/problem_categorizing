{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Small & Tough with lots of features but software is glitchy.", "Author": "Vaughn \"The answer man!\"", "ReviewID": "R2QWOW21RHTAML", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned the e71x for over two years.  I still have it and will probably use it until it dies. This phone has one shining feature; it is as tough as nails! I love the size, features and durability of the e71x. But all is not perfect in paradise.  Although this phone has a lot to love, it has a lot of problems.  So here is an idea of what is like to own the e71x.THE THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE E71X:1. The OS:  Nokia stopped supporting the Symbian S60 3rd Edition OS almost immediately after they released it.  There are lots of glitches with this OS that need to be fixed via updates, but Nokia does not care.  There are thousands of e71x users like me that have begged them to fix the problems with this OS and we get no response. The e71x hit the market about the time of the Iphone and it did not get the huge reception that Nokia wanted, so the just abandoned it. That really stinks and shows poor character for a large company like Nokia.2. App Support:  If I were going to buy this phone again, I would buy the e71 and not the e71x.  The e71 and the e71x are identical except for the OS.  Somehow, even though they claim to have the same OS (Symbian S60 3rd Edition), some apps that will go work on the e71, will not work on the e71x. So there a lot fewer apps for the e71x.  But what really irritates me is that of the few apps that are available for the e71x, 9 out of 10 are not stand alone apps, but require network data support to even start up.  So if you are like me, a person who thinks it is dumb to pay $60 a month for a data plan on a phone that has wifi, then you will be ticked to find that most of the apps for the e71x require a data plan.  I don't mean that some of their feature will not work if you don't have a data plan, I mean that they will not even start up if they don't find a data connection. And just in case your are thinking of it; no, they will not recognized a wifi connection. So after two years of owning this phone, I have only found a couple apps that will work on it without a data plan.  I can tell you positively that, they people that engineered the OS for the e71x, deliberately made it in a way so as to force you to buy a data plan.  I paid top dollar to buy my phone so that I would not have pay for a data a plan that I would not use.  It really, really chaps me that AT&T; and Nokia conspired together to do what they did.3. Battery Life:  The battery life of the e71x is pretty bad.  I seldom make it through a day without having to charge my phone. The most I get out of it is a couple hours of talk time.  I have bought new OEM batteries for it, but they die just as quick as the old ones.  And just wait until you turn wifi on.  Oh my!  You can literally watch the battery meter go down.  I am not sure what kills the battery so fast, because this phone has a relatively large battery pack compared to other phones I have used.  For one thing, there are no manual controls for screen brightness. The e71x relies on a light sensor to adjust the the screen brightness, but it has never worked on my e71x, so my screen is always at it's brightest.  There is a slider control to adjust the sensitivities of the light sensor, but adjusting it has no effect on my phone.  Lots of other people have complained about this to Nokia, but as I have said before, Nokia does not care.  Oh, and the phone has a light breathing function when not in use that is impossible to turn off.  Basically, the phone sits there and slowly lights up and slowly dims, as if it is breathing. So even when you are not using it, it running the battery down.4. Wifi:  The wifi card on the e71x, is pretty weak, but it does work (for the 20 minutes you have battery life). The problem with it is really related to the OS.  The e71x has three idles screen themes (really should be called Layouts) and on each of the three themes appears a link to your wifi function.  So say you are sitting in a Burger King and want to check if there is a wifi hotspot.  You can quickly whip out your phone, click on the wifi link and be scanning for a signal.  Great right? Well, unfortunately that link causes your phone to crash three to four times a day, in what is call the infamous \"Idle Screen Theme Error\".  The phone will crash, sound an alarm and then give you the Idle Screen them error, and then come back online.  At first you don't notice anything wrong with your idle screen theme until you try to use your wifi.  That is when you notice that the wifi link is gone.  You then spend the next three days trying figure out what has happened, only to discover that you have once again been the victim of the glitchy Symbian S60 3rd Edition OS and that Nokia has no plans to fix the problem.  Now you are stuck with having to dig five menus deep into the phone settings to get to the wifi function, or go through the process of resetting your idle screen theme several times a day.5. GPS:  The e71x does have a gps, but it might as well not.  It takes no less then 5 minutes for it to find satellite signal if you are standing dead still in the wide open. But the really bad thing is that I have not been able to find a single stand alone app that will work with the GPS that does not required a data plan. If you have a data plan and are willing to stand out in the open for five minutes every time you want to use the gps, I guess it might work for you, but for me it is useless.6. Camera: The camera on the e71x is pretty bad when compared to other cameras of other smartphones with 3.2MP cameras.  Have even seen 2MP smartphone cameras that do better.  I actually used a panel made up of some friends to judge the quality of two other smartphones (3.2MP & 2MP) against the e71x.  The e71x lost hands down.  I seldom use it as a result of the poor quality.THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THE E71X:1. Size and Durability:  The e71x is a brick. It is really small for all the features it has and it is built more sturdier then any other smartphone I have held.  This was the main reason I bought the e71x in the first place and it has not disappointed me in this regard. I bought a slim anti-slip gel case for it when I first got it and it has been great.  It has fallen a few times on concrete, but the phone still looks and functions like it did when it was brand new.2. Keyboard & Buttons:  I am a big man with fat fingers.  At first I though I would have a problem with the small keyboard on the e71x, but after a few days of break-in time I was typing away.  Like the rest of the phone, the keyboard and the buttons feel solid and after two years of heavy use, still look brand new.  Not one single letter or symbol is faded.3. Screen:  The screen is bright and sharp, even if it is small (you can't have everything).  I have used screen protectors from day one and it still looks great.4. Advanced voice calling support:  I hate holding a phone to my ear, so I use a bluetooth 99% of the time.  I also hate having to pull my phone out of my pocket and look through my address book (over 300 entries) to find a  number to call.  But I don't have to because the e71x has advance phone calling support. I just have to push and hold the button on my Plantronics Voyager PRO Plus headset and speak the name of the person I want to call.  Wallah!  That is as easy as it gets.5. Text to Speech Function:  The e71x has text to speech functions and will speak out the name of the person calling if they are in your address book.  So say you are driving your car and your phone rings.  It's in your pocket and it is difficult to get it out to see who is calling.  Not a problem with the e71x.  It rings and then says the name of the person (if they are in your address book).  If the call is from someone not in address book it just rings, but this tells you that you don't know the person that well and you can decide to let them leave a voicemail if you don't want to take an anonymous call.6. Bluetooth:  Unlike some phone that don't like (or are software restricted from) transferring data with other Bluetooth devices, the e71x seems to be able to connect and transfer to any other Bluetooth device that will talk to it.  I Like freedom and hate it when manufactures restrict their products to work only with in their engineered limitations (I am talking about you APPLE!).Well, that is about it.  You should know all you need to know about the e71x now.  If this phone had a better OS (or at least better support from Nokia), better camera, better battery life and better apps support, it would be a five star phone.  That being said, it is still pretty darn good phone for phone and texting functions, and I would not shy away from buying another, but never at full price again.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Slim and pretty tough", "Author": "A Fan of Hydrogen", "ReviewID": "RMUE7Y9M4LCHA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this for a couple years now and it is a pretty durable phone.

After some research I learned that the battery that came with my phone is a knockoff, it's not even the battery that Nokia sells the phone with. Additionally, after further review I was able to find images of the E71x in retail packaging and it is not what mine came in. I am pretty well convinced that my phone, even though it was not stated in the description, is a refurbished item.

It was completely submerged and is now sitting in a bag of rice. I really love this phone. I love the wifi capability and the full keyboard. I'm no good with touch screens, so this design was perfect for me. Stores a lot of pictures and videos and the alarm clock feature is nice as well. I also love the calendar/ to do list on the home screen. The buttons were not too small (I have small fingers) and the ringtone settings were able to be customized and controlled.I really hope this rice trick works, because this is a great phone and it's too expensive to buy the unlocked version!I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone, especially those who do not need to be connected to the internet 24/7 and just need it primarily for texting, talking, and planning.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "The BEST phone ever!!!", "Author": "Tina Watkins", "ReviewID": "R1NPHR1DDHWGXV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been the best phone I've EVER had!

We have been very pleased. On 2009 we bought the N71 model. Great phone, very reliable, easy to use, sturdy, and an excellent all around phone. Because my phone had suffered a lot of abuse during the yeas, and after giving a lot of thought to it, we decided to order to new N71 phones, as we were so happy with the ones we had.The mistake: Buying this old (produced in 2009) phones as if they were new. Since day 1 my phone presented problems with the Bluetooth. After 1 week, the phone lost the ability to recognize the service provider. I changed SIMs with my old phone, and it was working, installed it in my wife's new phone, it was working, installed it in my new phone, a no service message will be shown.We thought that maybe I had bad luck and I had gotten a lemon.On my wife's phone, which we had chance to try, the software was very different than the one provided in the normal N71 (N71x was produced for AT&T;, and some functions were limited, some wireless capabilities were blocked, and all the software was limited to those apps approved by AT&T.; Not good). If you liked the Nokia mail app, sorry, can't use it with this phone. Want to use the AT&T; mail service? No can't do, it's no longer available. This is what you will find all the time with this phone. Things don't work, they are no longer available, or their capabilities are limited.Make yourself a favor and look for a more recent phone.We are now iPhone users.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "A relief from touch phones", "Author": "Kujo", "ReviewID": "R1X0HHKN2G5W00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cannot speak highly enough about this phone.  I've gone through 4 phones in the last 2 years looking for a durable phone that doesn't irritate me.  There are no good touch phones except for the Iphone, but since I use a company phone and swap out a SIM I cannot use the Iphone.  This phone is beautiful, easy to use, and just a relief.Pros:  Keypad locks so no pocket dialing, Memory card slot with internal memory, Bluetooth, Good sound quality, lots of ways to set-up quick keys to access contacts, messaging, camera, ect.  The best part about this phone is the battery life, I have never had a phone last as long as this battery.  6 months out and it will last days on a single charge with lots of phone calls and messaging.  I rarely have to put a charge on this thing and when I do plug it in it charges very quickly.  If anyone is experiencing anything different you must have a bad battery or have never had phones that I have that needed to be charged daily.  The phone is as tough as nails, not literally, don't use a hammer on it, but it does take abuse very well.Cons: The messaging isn't the \"bubble style\" like in an ipod, the messages come independent of any previous messages or replies, the buttons are a bit small when messaging but you very quickly become adjusted to this and typing is again a breeze.  Picture quality is phone picture quality, it doesn't compare to a digital camera but is nice for sending pictures over messaging or to facebook.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer beware.

Yes, there are ways you can reconfigure for t-mobile but why go through all of that?  The camera is acceptable in good lighting and close proximity but the flash is weak, total darkness.
