{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "LCRD1", "ReviewID": "R3U9SSKLZ305A1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got it last week (may 13)Nice looking and thin.Before buying i read review claiming about screen quality,  although it is tft  looks really nice (of course you forget this when you see the htc one m7 screen).About loudspeaker i think it's weak comparing to other devices due to its location, its also probable you mute it with your fingers when holding the phoneI dont know what to say about camera, it is suposed to be a really , really good one.  and i still think it is.  but on superior auto mode it works with random results  even repeating the shoot under same condition.System performance is good,  i dont like the gadget for enabling devices.  eg.  you enable wifi,  but you don't get  available hotspot info  like other devices. instead i must go then to settings and look for networks.  (hope not be missing config for this)Device is finger print magnet, but which phone isn't?  i used it on U.S.A. with T Mobile, and data worked only under edge mode, device signal sensitivity was faulty in zones where using iphones with same carrier worked fine.  In Venezuela i use it with Digitel and worked flawlessly in 3g+ mode.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXcellent", "Author": "Karla C.", "ReviewID": "R3MR270LQW2J0F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone, everything works perfectly so far.Great camera, great intephase, good sound.Only thing is that the speaker is a bit too low, but I am guessing it's because it's waterproof.

But when I received the package. There is no SEAL, It was UN-boxed already. It was just like NEW. If I return this I will be charged a minimum 15%. I was not happy with this.It seems that this item is from China. I saw some applications have Chinese characters by default. I am worrying about quality of this in the future.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "GunSession \"With great Power, Comes great Res...", "ReviewID": "R37PAJUO7LYR3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Due to certain sellers out there you gotta be careful who  you buy from.

This phone is really nice and does what it promises. Its fast sturdy and well built. it comes with 16gb internal memory and can hold an sd card. Its water and dust proof also it has an awesome huge display. If you can afford it this is a great investment along with the Xperia Z1. But keep in mind when buying the xperia z there are 2 models. 1) C6602 - This means this model is only compatible in 2G and Certain 3G networks. NO 4G SUPPORT. 2) C6603 - This means this model supports 2G, 3G & 4G which can work worldwide.Overall this phone has an awesome camera that if your into pics and fast capture business Xperia will do the job for you. I've been owing a Xperia Smartphone since 2010 and till date i would recommend xperia.The Flaws- Sony Xperia always has 1 flaw on the mobile tech, LACK of update schedule. They are always the last to release their update. And Sony only offers 2-3 Updates per phone. EG: if your on Jelly bean 4.1, you will get the full jelly bean update trend. When Android 4.4 launches you'd get that update. When android 4.5 or later comes out u'd get that update. After those updates that's it for official releases. You can Do it yourself with the help of XDA in the future to achieve custom roms etc.If you want to know more about this phone check out my Youtube Channel @ http://www.youtube.com/user/rgunz12", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT PRODUCT.", "Author": "Kamila Flower", "ReviewID": "R3UD4J1VIWJL4E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE LOVE MY NEW XPERIA!!
