{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Smart choice in a dense smart phone market; great features, functionality", "Author": "35-year Technology Consumer \"8-tracks to 802.11\"", "ReviewID": "R26R48PF4N6VVY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before addressing the hardware and functionality of this phone, let's address quickly the five-part equation that makes up your overall smart phone user experience:(1) the hardware...the phone itself(2) operating system software(3) installed applications(4) the network (overall, and where you happen to be using the phone at a particular time)(5) the service providerIn some cases, there are serial dependencies on the factors above, as many phones are tied to specific operating systems or service providers. Or perhaps you spend a lot of time in an area without 4G service. Just remember that even if you make a great phone choice, deficiencies in the other areas can diminish your overall user experience.Don't move to a smart phone without some research into these choices. Which provider? Which mobile operating system? Who can offer me the best service, or the best combination of value and service? The rest of this review assumes you've already figured out why a phone with the Android operating system might be a better choice for you than an iPhone, a Blackberry or a Windows-based smart phone solution...Bottom line for the HTC EVO 4G: feature loaded, user-friendly and a hard choice to go wrong with in a crowded smart phone market.The phone ships with an impressive array of capability and apps, and finding and installing new ones from the Android marketplace is easy even for non-techies.Two very strong performers in the pre-installed applications are Google-powered Voice Search and Navigate: both are eerily good at delivering search results and driving/walking directions. This phone's voice-to-text interface is also very good, and can be used for both composing text messages and delivering search results without typing. Surprisingly, a voice-based dialing app that is part of the operating system's collection of widgets seldom gets one right. The Evo's on-screen keyboard is adaptive to your compositions over time, and will suggest auto-completes for words you frequently type.The phone includes two cameras: an outward facing high resolution (8 megapixel) still/video camera, and a front facing 1.3 megapixel camera for video applications. It ships with an 8 GB microSD card. One surprising oversight of this phone is the placement of the microSD card inside the battery compartment. Although you can move files to an from it via the USB port, this phone would be improved if the card were accessible without removing the back cover.In addition to the USB port, the phone has a 3.5mm aux audio jack and an HDMI port.The rear of the phone includes a \"kickstand\", allowing you to stand the phone on a horizontal surface when viewing the display in landscape mode (great for using the speakerphone or watching videos).Customization of the scrolling display screens is intuitive. In our house, even less technically savvy users were re-arranging icons and applications in no time.Each of phone, video and still image quality are satisfactory.The overall finish of this phone is --literally-- quite slick. It can go sliding easily on leather car seat, and both the screen and frame will attract and display fingerprints. Whether or not you opted in to the damage/loss insurance that most providers offer, I'd strongly recommend both a screen protector and some case or holster to offer a modicum of protection to the phone.Mnay options exist for protection, but for our multiple Evo phones we've found the following to provide a good mix of protection and price:--\"Fishbone\" protective case (red linked here; other colors are available)--SGP STEINHEIL Anti FingerprintSprint Screen Protector (Anti Fingerprint)Let these protective devices soak up the wear and tear instead of your phone and display.Other reviews have discussed battery life, and it's worth addressing. This phone has five separate radio transmit/receive devices:-the standard cellular (3G/CDMA) transceiver-the 4G transceiver-Bluetooth (for short-range use of hands-free devices and data exchange)-GPS receiver-Wifi transceiverEach of these devices will exert its own demand on the battery. Selectively turning them off when not needed, along with setting a shorter time to turn off the display (2 minutes or 1 minute) will go a long way to mitigate the battery issue. Additionally, there are extended life aftermarket batteries (usually with an accompanying modified case cover to accommodate their their additional bulk) that will easily get you through your work day away from external power.A note about apps:Android is a Google operating system, and access to the Android marketplace for additional apps requires entry through a Google/Gmail account (either existing or one you create when setting up the phone). In return for the apps, be aware that you surrender significant personal information on your phone, your location (at minumum the nearest cell tower, and in some cases your GPS-derived location) and details of how you used the phone and applications. Providing this information is the cost of admission for functionality of the apps. I'm not offering a value judgement on this...just pointing it out for your information.Finally, a note about pricing:Comparison shop and pay attention when you're ready to make the move to a smart phone. For the hardware purchase, you can expect to find considerable differences in the prices (even when upgrade discount and rebates are included) from different vendors. Be sure to check out each each of your provider's \"store\" (brick and mortar, by phone and online), big box stores and even Amazon's new wireless store. It's worth investing a couple minutes in this research to save a considerable amount on the purchase price.Becoming a smart phone user begins with shopping smartly! )-", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "WHY THIS PHONE IS CONSISTENTLY SPRINT's BEST.", "Author": "Harkanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "RHWBOLKQQRSCG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Samsung phone Android experience was slightly different than my HTC Android phone experience. HTC is definitely better, more stable, browsing is better, battery life is worse but the overall quality and the sturdiness of the phone in question is penultimate. Let me try to tell you why I am so enamored by this phone.1. The browsing is excellent, the downloading is quick, the web pages load in seconds and even on 3G the phone is super fast, I have never switched on the 4G for more than an hour and feel it should only be done when you're downloading a very big file. You may wonder what the purpose of 4G is, so well, although the 4G function is there, this phone is faster than any 3G phones available on the network by a mile (Hero, Moment, Optimus S to name a few) So the browsing is excellent.2. I used GPS once while trying to locate a bar a friend of mine was at in downtown. Anyone who's been to downtown manhattan knows what a headache directions are there but using this I got there just in time. Yes, it takes a bit of getting used to and yes if you forget to switch the GPS off, the phone is going to complain and be really hot.3. Of maybe the seven or eight phones I've used in my life time, this one has the loudest speaker when using Pandora. It is very clear at the same time. While the EPIC may have a louder speaker, the Evo has the clear one, for hours at a time I let it play at volume level 2 with the screen switched off and it is the most delightful jukebox. There are several applications for music and the phone's customization and level of speed and concentration is nothing short of excellent. It never confuses between two running apps and multi-tasking is the best on any phone. Credit to Android and HTC Sense developers.4. The kickstand is a unique feature which can be helpful once in a way, the back of the black EVO is smooth and a pleasure to hold in your hands. The QWERTY touchscreen is really good and I have almost mastered it. When I was using the Nexus S, the touchscreen keyboard was awful. The touchscreen on this phone is the best i have seen on any phone. It is maybe better than my ipod touch too which now is a device i never touch. I don't need to use SWYPE cause I'm fast enough holding the phone vertically.5. The alarm feature is just awesome and I had to make a point about it because even if you're listening to music it will give two sounds, one for the music, the other for the alarm, functionality and customization again get a big score here. The NOTIFICATION bar is the best I've seen on any Android phone.6. The BATTERY life is horrid. Worse than Samsung phones. I have a solution that will cost you money. There is a Seidio battery which goes into your phone but doesn't require an extended back. Get that and you will get a day with your phone. With the STOCK BATTERY, there is no use using your phone.7. One of my BIGGEST COMPLAINTS with this phone is the earphone speaker being way too low. When I'm in a busy room full of people, I always have to get up and go out. With my Blackberry or Samsung I never had to this. So yes, this is not the best phone in the world to talk with. It's a very big flaw and makes me dislike the phone immensely. When you plug in headphones, it is loud enough of course but who does that everyday or all the time? not me i guess.8. Ships with 8GB memory, the touchscreen is flawless and never skips a single beat, the phone never freezes and yes, it has restarted itself once or twice since I have had it but I have never had a phone that doesn't ever reboot once in a way so can't complain. I don't use any app killer, at night i keep my brightness to the lowest level, I restart my phone daily to kill any apps running in the background. I use Winamp for playing music. There are several shortcut and widget options. The phone has a beautiful time display, weather display and quite a sense of humor too. The four capacitive buttons always work.The GREEN NOTIFICATION light is friendly and not too urgent like the Blackberry's RED. I know it is silly to compare but I am silly. The camera is just awful to be honest. Though better than the Blackberry, it is still very difficult to take pictures in the night. The flash is too flashy and washes out the face. Netflix runs smooth, I haven't cracked the screen yet but I've seen several cracked Evo's. I didn't bother rooting it or any of that nonsense.Overall, a solid phone with 2 flaws I can live with. I am not going to deduct any marks because the phone has several stand outs.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Refurbished!

So with 2 years of use I can report the good, the bad and the ugly.The Good-You can download free apps, ring tones.The Bad-It's super slow!  Ok, so over 2 years of texting my girlfriend and other people, when I send a text I watch the disc spin around on the screen for like 15 seconds before it will send.  Even when typing the words in the text it will select words that are not spelt correctly?  Where's the spellcheck?The Ugly, forget the Bad, most of everything on this phone is just pure ugly.The battery - lasts about 5 hours without use!  If I use the GPS ot watch a programme on the sprint network I'll be lucky to get 60 minues.  I bought another battery as a back up and again only get about 60 minutes of use.  Ridiculous!  I have the phone constantly on charge, in my car, at my desk in work and at home.The phone will randomly shut down by itself.Using the GPS it can freeze up....a nightmare when you're driving in another city 600 miles from home.  It can also send you in circles, it can miss a turn and say 're-routing' only to take you the same way again.  Use Google Maps! not the Sprint GPS that comes on the phone.I'm having to pay Sprint $10 a month for a data plan because this is a 4G phone.  I I don't get 4G where I live and don't even get it in the capital city of my state!  so it's a waste on money.SummaryFor 2 years I've paid Sprint $69/mth plus $10 data plan plus $8 insurance plus taxes and surcharges....for what.... for a phone with a standby time of 5 hours, a useage time of 60 minutes, slow processor, no 4G (maybe 0.1% of the time when I'm out), awful GPS, Sprint TV that shows nothing worth watching unless you pay more and upgrade for the premium channels, randomly shutsdown at the most inconvenient times.I went on a 6 hour bike ride yesterday.  Phone was fully charged.  I put it in a pocket in the back of my shirt.  At the end of my ride the phone showed the warning signal and advised to charge immediately!.  WTH!  using the other battery does the same thing.Awful!Since my 2 year contract is up with Sprint I'm shopping around!

But the post is misleading because it says this is a new phone. This phone is not new, it is referbished and the reason why i am upset isnt because it is refurbished. I am upset because a refurbished evo 4g is $100 cheaper then this phone is. I paid 280 thinking this was a new phone and another seller was selling \"refurbished evo 4g's\" for 160!!!!! I am very upset because of this. Another thing is that the battery was bad. They sent me a bad used battery. Luckily i have insurance and sprint gave me a new battery for free, which would have been 40 if they didnt replace it for me, but i am very upset with this company. I love the phone but the company is HORRIBLE!UPDATE!!!!--If i may also add this phone is defective. about 3 months into using this phone the charger port got lose so i brought it to sprint thinking they could fix it and they couldnt. it disconnected completely from the chip?? I dont remember the exact verbage of what was wrong. so i had to pay another 100 as a deductible to sprint for them to send me another phone. This is the most misleading company i have ever ordered from. i will NEVER buy another phone from amazon EVER AGAIN!!!

Not something specific to this phone, but worth mentioning.The bad:- after slightly more than 1 year of light usage, the phone keeps rebooting itself. Changed the battery, still same issue. Phone is basically unusable.- contacts can't be sync-ed with the GMail account. The sync does nothing. Since the phone is not on long enough (without rebooting itself), I probably lost all the contacts too.Considering how expensive this phone has been, this has been a terrible experience.

It dials out in my gym bag or in my pocket even though I have a security lock on the screen.2.  I bought this phone in 2010 when 3G was mostly used.  This was the first generation of 4G.  So, its normally on 3G constantly trying to find a 4G connection.  This process drains the battery.3.  Charging the phone.  -  The charge port is delicate and within one year I had to replace the phone with insurance.  The cord desensitizes and does not create contact to allow the electric charge.  The new charge cord lasts a short time. The charge port on the phone skews easily with NORMAL usage. Now, I have to jiggle the cord charger into the port until the precise angle creates electrical flow and charges the phone.  This process can take about 30 seconds to about 5 minutes per attempt and for the charging light to come on. Also, fully charging the phone takes several hours.4.  After six months, the battery runs out in two hours with little use.  Yes,  I have the task killer program.5.  The Wi-Fi program turns itself on automatically and looks for local connections.  My phone usually selects the Wi-Fi from the hotel down the street that requires a password that I don't have.  So, I receive an error code when I choose to check my emails or use the internet.  Then, I have to turn the wireless option off.  This allows me to get online.  This happens about five times a day.6.  Its slow7.  There is a double loud \"beep\" every time I make a phone call and I'm waiting for the first ring/connection.  The BEEP BEEP is loud when the phone is near my ear so now I only use the hands free/speaker option.8.  Sprint solicits my phone for special programs like voice mail to text. Its free for 30 days and then a monthly charge.  The phone is slow and the prompt sneaked up while texting.  I accidentally must have activated it and even though I don't use this option, I started receiving an incidental cost on my monthly bill.  How annoying to receive solicitations that are automatically pre-selected to the yes option from my own phone company.  \"Oops, did I just purchase something ?\"9.  The touch-screen option does not work if my fingers are wet or moist.10. Some of my desktop icons and clock disappear while making phone calls.  I have to go through applications to re-download.11. The weather program does not work.  The standard message is \"No Weather data available.\"12. Bluetooth communication in my car sucks with my brand new fully loaded 2012 VW Jetta SE.Things I like about the phone:1.  The HTC EVO 4G was one of the smart phone options available without choosing AT&T.; In 2010, the iPhone required an AT&T; contract.2.  It has a nice big screen3.

Anyway, hopefully Sprint has cleaned up their act and aren't looking to stick it to us anymore with some sneaky charges.  Back to the phone - the EVO4G is great, Google maps navigation GPS works great and the voice recognition destination setting is amazing.  It is better than any built-in car nav system I have used.  It is kind of an exercise to get an address book database imported, it seems like you really need to become a Gmail user to do this.  Anway, I am loving the Android apps, the barcode reader, and the camera is pretty good.  The bluetooth seems to work ok, it glitched once in a new Honda, but resetting the phone fixed it.  The stupid Sprint Nascar apps are annoying and can't be deleted it seems. Battery life sucks of course, so you have to add an extended battery, then a 32GB xd card for tunes and movies.

The phone has its flaws, although I find it to remain a fantastic phone despite its faults. The evo has many incredible appendages, even though I strongly recommend this phone, I feel obligated to address its problems as well.First off, the phone's display has breath-taking graphics which cannot be compared to most competition. The phone's 4.3 inch-screen displays pin sharp lettering and vague colored videos. The phone's display is LED, making the screen bright and easier to view on-screen applications. For me, this is a blessing because I can read texts and contacts with no hassle.Another great extra is the phone's camera. The camera is HD with a whopping 8 megapixels to keep your precious memories as vague as the moment they happened. I cannot forget to mention the phone has duel camera, meaning one on the back side of the phone and one on the front as well. Not only are both of the cameras good for taking pictures, but you can also record videos in the same amazing HD view.As I mentioned before the phone does have its flaws, such as overheating. For example, I can have my phone at bedside overnight and wake up to a burning hot phone. Although this has only happened to me a couple of times, I feel it should still be addressed. One way to solve this issue is to keep it in a cooler place; I am convinced it happens because my room temperature fluctuates so much.Another problem I find with this phone is charging. The phone will work well with its original HTC charger. Although, when I used it with a different charger it would only charge to a certain percent and then die on me. The phone would give the impression of being charged although it really wasn't. This is an easy fix; you would just have to use the original HTC charger the phone came with and the phone will charge as normal. Overall, the phone's regular charge lasts about 9 hours. Although, I pretty much use my phone constantly, so a person that may be nonchalant about using their phone, will have a substantially longer battery life than me.My phone service is sprint which is an okay service, nothing too spectacular. I don't like how I only get signal certain places, while in others I'll barely have any bars. Although, signal does vary by your location, so I'm assuming it's just where I live. Do not let the service prevent you from buying the phone though; you will not regret getting the phone.Despite the HTC evo's flaws, I would still recommend this phone because the flaws are easy fixes. This is also a phone for more experienced smart phone users because beginners may find it difficult to use. Every phone has its good and its bad, the evo I believe is the best and easiest to fix when flaws occur.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "should have bought a new phone", "Author": "weilljames", "ReviewID": "R1OT9NROUZ4XDB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my daughter. right off the bat she said part of the screen did not work which I later confirmed then it gave us trouble charging. took it to sprint and they said the port was bad. not happy at all", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible Battery Life", "Author": "Mary", "ReviewID": "R3JKI06B1CIJ3D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I love the features and quickness of this phone but the battery life is absolutely horrible.

But when I turned the phone on, It had stuck pixels so some parts of the screen are brighter than others. It's really in between noticeable and non-noticeable. The phone came with Android 2.2 (Ewww) and could for now (as of 12/30/12) be upgraded to a better Android 2.3.

It has exceeded all my expectations for a smartphone. I still haven't utilized all of its capabilities and still learning new things about it. The phone is very underrated and lives in the shadows of Apple iphone and samsung galaxy phones, but i think in many ways it beats those phones. There are a few minor gripes but nothing in comparison how solid the phone is.Pros: Screen at 4.3\" is big and amazing. Every time I look at an iphone the screen looks too small. HTC did a great job filling the screen close to all edges. Very little wasted space. HTC sense operating software is excellent and very stable. The capacitive touch buttons are very useful and saves a ton of time to navigate around. The text wrapping on the internet is excellent and a necessity in my opinion. Text wrapping that is absent on the iphone and that is a deal breaker for me. Voice calls are very clear and speaker phone is pretty good. Bluetooth works excellent on my car stereo and links easily every time I get in my car. Ability to swap out batteries is huge bonus. There is a lot more to say but I won't get too wordy.Cons: Battery life isn't the best but at least you can swap a battery out instantly. No photo gallery organization so it just lumps photos in the pre-made categories. I would like to see the ability to customize your photo folders. The camera isn't the best under certain conditions, but can take some great photos. However, you don't know when you are going to get good photos or not, so you can't depend on the camera too much. Phone memory isn't the best. Some pre-installed programs take up space and you can't delete them or move them to the sd card.All in all this is a very competitive phone that stacks up very well against the competition.

After seeing this phone for a $99 promotion at the Sprint store, I had to buy it.  With one of the biggest screens out there, the Android operating system, and the great applications it comes with, it was a no-brainer.  Overall, I love this phone.PROS+This phone has a HUGE screen.  Compare it to most smartphones and it puts them to shame.+It comes with great pre-installed apps, especially the GPS app it comes with.  This is a really great substitute for a GPS.+It's Android.  I personally highly prefer Android over Apple OS, so this is a pro to me.+\"Kickstand\" allows you to prop up your phone to watch video.+1.3 MP camera and you can even adjust it so it aims toward you.  Really great for taking pictures of yourself :P+4G - I don't use it too often, but I can't deny it's speediness.  As long as you are in a 4G area, your internet and phone quality is way faster and better quality than 3G by a long shot.+Easy to use.  So easy, my mom could use it.  Very user-friendly.+It's so sleek and thin.CONS+As a Sprint phone, I will say this...I don't like Sprint.  Recently switching from T-Mobile, I didn't expect to see such a huge change in network quality, but I did.  I can't get reception in parts of my house, friends tell me that their calls go straight to voicemail more than half the time (I never even hear it ring), calls drop all of the time, I get the dreaded \"network busy\" error frequently.  It's a nightmare.  Considering I live within a few miles of the Sprint Headquarters, I expected more.+It's definitely not for the klutzy.  Well, I'm a klutz, and I already broke this phone once.  I dropped it screen down about 2 feet above concrete, and it shattered almost completely.  It was actually still usable, but painful to type on.  By comparison, I used to have the MyTouch with T-Mobile, and even though it was totally beat up, I never completely broke it.  You definitely need a case for this phone.+Battery life.  This is a common complaint with most smartphones, but I found it particularly bad on this one.  I even bought the extended battery, and I swear it hasn't made a bit of difference.  Even when taking every step that I can, battery life is still bad.This is what I do to help my battery from draining:-When I don't care about using the internet and know I won't for awhile, I turn off all mobile networks completely.-Make sure Wi-Fi/4G is off-Instead of 60 seconds until it turns to black, make it 30.-Adjust brightness so it's not so bright.-Turn off GPS/Bluetooth.It's admittedly kind of a pain doing all of this to conserve battery life, but if you keep all of that on, your phone will be dead in no time, *even* with an extended battery.  However, I still love my phone.  Sprint, durability, and battery life are my main complaints of it.  I highly suggest a case.  They even make them for EVOs with extended batteries, even though they don't get as fancy.Overall, this is a great, modern phone.

Speak out and you will never see satisfaction.Amazon is nearly an accomplice in the fraud perpetrated by their vendors against their customers, turning a blind eye to the illegal activities occurring in their market place everyday.This vendor, Cell Beautiful, who turns out to be Great Value Cellular, apparently, is involved in the selling of illegally altered phones; they have the address of a house listed with Amazon, that been listed for sale for almost a year, and according to the Realtor is sitting empty.The seller, Cell Beautiful(GVC) had an Amazon ad that listed a clean ESN device.What they shipped was a device that Sprint informed us did not have clear ownership, was not released from contract, and had an outstanding balanceGVC informed me I was mistaken, that the phone was fine.  I informed them, in detail, of the conversation with Sprint, and offered a three way call with Sprint.All in all several hours of my life wasted trying to activate this phone and then to get GVC understand(admit) what was happening.GVC finally claimed a simple mistake had been made and they shipped a phone that had been altered to operate under Boost.The phone shipped was not altered in any way according to am examination by myself and a nearby cell phone repair shop.GVC told me, that if I returned it, they would fix the issue with the phone, or ship me a replacement phone.I informed them that I expected a clear ESN phone, not an altered device and that I had no problems taking what ever steps were necessary if they failed to make good on the transactions and cover any expenses I would experience due to choosing, foolishly, to deal with them.GVC also told me they would cover the shipping.They did not.Instead, I had to leave work, drive to the Post Office and go without lunch in order to have the money to pay to ship the phone back to GVC.According to Amazon, I have been refunded my money, (but not according to the bank) and issued one of their useless $10.00 credits for my out of pocket expenses.I can return the case I purchased to go with this phone ($40) for even more useless Amazon credit.Why is the credit useless? because you can only use it on Amazon, for Amazon products.Why do I no longer feel that I can purchase through Amazon?Because they do not stand behind what happens through their marketplace, they will not investigate the practices of the people who sell here, therefore you cannot trust that you will not go through unnecessary grief and aggravation.There is already too much stress going on, I do not need more, simply trying to purchase a smartphone that meets certain requirements, because a two bit employer can, because of the current employer friendly environment, make and get away with ridiculous demands on employees should not cause so much stress that my girlfriend feels that she should go back to her mothers, in another state, to stop being a burden to me.I used to love Amazon, the last month has soured me on Amazon forever, and left my girlfriend a wreck.Don't start feeling too relaxed on Amazon, Caveat Emptor still applies, maybe extra here on Amazon.

Calling for support, I was told to remove the battery and that it would need repair.  When I received the phone back in the mail, there were no details about the repair and no instructions.

Six months later, the company still has not gotten around to putting that new number in their network database so that I can activate it.I wasted $300 on HTC for a phone that has no possibility of ever working again because of a technicality in their limited warranty repair service.

But you cannot remove this bloatware and the internal memory that remains is paltry.  Even though I have a 32 GB SD card that is hardly full, I am constantly running out of memory space because many apps won't run off the SD card.

The phone started to go to a minute-long loading screen every time I minimized an app and went to the home screen. It started to refuse to respond whenever the charger was plugged in. The charging port started to fail, and it was harder and harder to get the red LED on the top to light up for charging. Then, I started being unable to change the volume when headphones were plugged in. The touch screen also refused to work with headphones plugged in. The battery started draining so fast, I had to buy an extra battery and keep that charged to get through a day of light use. My friend's old iPhone 3G seems faster. Lately, it seems the phone has become sentient- only occasionally will the touch screen respond, only rarely will it charge easily, and somehow, Bluetooth, GPS, WiFi, and 4G would turn on. All of those, especially the 4G, contributed to battery drain. And now, it's no longer supported by my local Sprint store, nor is it listed online.

Their customer service is through the roof.I bought this phone with the understanding I would get a memory card (after all...it was there on the ad) when my phone came ( in a timely manor mind you) it was missing the memory card. I called to ask if maybe they had forgotten it. I was informed that there wasn't supposed to be one listed on the ad, but since I was told otherwise they went ahead and sent me one.After a bit I started playing with the camera, and noticed it didn't take as good of pictures as I was told it did. I researched the problem, and found that the internal camera wasn't working properly. I contacted my carrier ( Sprint) and after fighting with them to get insurance on the phone, I found out it was going to cost me $100 out of pocket to have them look at it, and possibly replace it. So on a whim, I wrote to Wireless Circle and asked if there was something I could do, and seeing as how I bought a refurbished phone, I was doubtful. They said to send it right in, and they would replace it ( it was past my 30 days...by 2 days and they did it no problem) I shipped them back my phone, sans charger and battery, and a few days later, I am the proud owner, of a fully functional HTC EVO 4G!

The phone needed to be wiped by sprint, LOTS of applications continue to run which drains the battery FAST! I mean, I charge my phone 3 times a day because I'm constantly on it for work. I'm told it's just something with the phone itself and i've downloaded an app to kill all the continuously running apps to try to salvage some battery life, but I just broke down yesterday and bought an extended battery from Sprint themselves.

I was pleased with the performance of the LG and thought that it was great for my needs. However, I had a friend playing with his EVO and asked to play a little. The processor on the EVO is insane, the screen and display look amazing and the feel of the phone is great. The screen is an inch larger than the LG, but the phone itself is only 1/2 inch taller and less than 1/2 an inch wider than the LG, making it still easy to fit in a pocket. I have downloaded apps on both 3G and Wifi and can't believe how much faster it is than the LG. The battery life is pretty similar to the LG, it lasts from 0700 to about 1600, but I work in dungeon with no reception, so it's constantly draining looking for signal, common for any phone I have seen in this place. Extra batteries are cheap and easy to swap out.My wife just got an iphone 4s and I was thinking about one also, I'm glad I went with the EVO, bigger screen, SD card, seems more user friendly and I don't have to worry about Siri telling me that she can't answer my question and suggesting I Google it, if I wanted to Google it, I would have in the first place.The ability to add apps to have different launchers and themes gives the Android platform an edge over the iphone, IMO. The boasts of the Apple market having more apps means little to me, everything I can think of is available in some form on Android. Seems to me that there is quite a bit of duplication of many apps on both. Having the Adobe preloaded and not having to Root or Jailbreak my phone to have it is also an edge, one that my wife hates.I ordered the High-Quality SlimLine Tough Case in BLACK for the HTC EVO 4G Phone - Slim Design with Chrome Accents for my phone and it doesn't seem to add much bulk but is very sturdy.The only things I didn't care for were the original lock screen and HTC Sense due to lack of features, these were easy fixes with the download of 2 apps, (lockmenu and GO Launcher EX). This phone is far superior to many that I have seen available, I don't need 3D, and Swype works well on the larger keyboard so I don't long for a physical keyboard on the Shift, even without swype, the keyboard is just as good as the iphone. The speaker is loud and clear on both speakerphone and music, the camera is great and has many options for enhancement. The kickstand is a nice plus, but I have only watched one video, so it doesn't get much use.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone...i love it!", "Author": "alyssa", "ReviewID": "R1BCISV11KUMRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my new phone!

Purchased phone back in October 2011. At first, the phone was great. Good battery life, decent speed, great signal, etc. etc. I had downloaded applications with no problem. Within a few months, the charge port quit working and I had to put weight on the charger jack (to keep it at an angle) in order for the phone to charge.I figured I could deal with it, a bit annoying, but doable - thought it would save me the headache of dealin with the seller and trying to return and yada yada yada.Later I realized that your FaceBook contacts do not Synch properly (I have literally tried everything short of uninstalling and reinstalling the FaceBook application). But, whatever.Also, the WiFi does in fact turn itself on...even when you turn it off. That is irritating. But ok...Now...battery does not hold charge as long as it used to. Ok, that happens. Phone restarts itself about 3 times a day...ok, maybe I can reset it back to factory settings and see if that helps (pain in the butt, but better than trying to deal with a return or buying a new one).The deal breaker: NO AUDIO SPEAKER now, it's quit working. Have to have sound on my phone - that is a must. It will vibrate but no ringer, no alarm, no alerts, no music, nadda. Can talk on it, but can't use the speaker phone on it.Since it's been less than a year I contacted the seller but I doubt anything will come of it. After doing some research on some other websites here is what I found to be VERY common problems with this phone:  - Defective Charger Port: usually comes loose within a few weeks to a few months  - Defective Audio Speaker: on top of poor quality it will randomly cut out or not work. Eventually, it quits working all together.  - Uncontrollable WiFi configurations: Turn it off and it will turn itself back on. This seems to have started with one of the OS updates during 2012  - Does not Synchronize Accounts: Though it says that it does and has synchronized your accounts, it does not synchronize everything (FaceBook friends, Email contacts, etc). These issues also seemed to have started after an OS update. Sometimes, uninstalling and reinstalling applications can help and sometimes it takes a factory reset on your phone, then update the phone OS and once phone is completely updated THEN install your applications & set-up your accounts. Will not update after that point though...just brings you up to date.  - Deteriorating battery life - this happens with a lot of phones but usually not until at least the one year mark (usually two years).  - Constant phone restart - this is disputed because of applications and viruses and what not...but it's a common complaint about the phone.For anyone that is looking to purchase this phone...it is a great phone - but not really worth the $$ when it has all these issues. Would recommend looking for a more up-to-date phone or make sure you get insurance with it and do back-ups of all your contacts so when you do start having issues, you can get it easily replaced.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "EVO 4G", "Author": "Giovanna De Luca", "ReviewID": "R2C2N4VCTOAGVY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recieved my EVO when promised.

For the first few months of ownership the phone worked great, then Android began updating its OS, and that is when many HTC customer's, including myself, started to feel the pain. HTC did a terrible job in trying to get the Evo phone to work properly with the Android OS updates. This was most apparent with the Gingerbread update last June. For myself and many other Evo users we lost the use of voice search, which would now only work in a completely silent environment, so forget about using it in a moving car. It took HTC months to acknowledge the problem, even though their own user forums were filled with dissatisfied customers complaining about this. Their efforts to ship a working patch to resolve this issue were a total failure. Voice search is only one of the problems, the phone's camera, which worked flawlessly when the phone was released now crashes after talking only a few pictures. It's not just the camera that crashes, you often have to reboot the phone itself after a camera crash since the whole unit bricks up. I have tried new patches from HTC to resolve these issues and THEY DONT WORK. Don't just take my word for it, go ahead and Google HTC Evo problems, particularly camera and voice search, you'll see many others who have the same problem. I feel that HTC has done little to nothing to resolve this and that their customer service is awful.

SERIOUSLY.  I've actually let it sit there just to time it out.  Like it'll say received message and I click messages then the screen will say \"Loading...\" forever.And the funny part is the battery life is so terrible, you can't even go a full 12 hours without it dying.  And especially with 37 minute message load times, you don't even need to be playing games or watching videos because it's constantly trying to load messages.  Your battery will be drained completely when the message does finally pop up and you want to return the text.Now to make things worse, your roommate who texted you saying, \"hey, can we meet up in 10 minutes\" will think you're an a-hole because it took you forty minutes to respond to that text.  While you were trying to meet up to re-sign the lease on your apartment, now it's too late and you're homeless.  You get fired from work because you no longer have a house to shower and smell like turds constantly.  You can't afford electricity so now you can't even charge your crap phone.

Maybe it's android and I'm blaming the wrong thing, but either way it blows.  Sometimes it'll freeze and I can't even pull up my contact list to make calls, unless if I wait half an hour or restart my phone which takes a solid ten minutes to restart.  Basically if you are getting rapes, robbed, murdered, pray you don't have this phone or you won't be able to call for help.  I've never wanted to slam my phone on the ground so many times in my life.  And I'm a pacifist too.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY", "Author": "Mudrzr", "ReviewID": "R1N9L9OZPZYQT9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is absolutely terrible.

Husband says that the phrase  \"Can't.

Sales person even said this is common and his \"fix\" was to keep removing the battery pack completely and then replacing it. That is ridiculous.- Camera is absolutely trash.  The flash is ridiculously bright and completely whites out everyone's face and everything around them- 4G? What's the point?  It just drains the already terrible battery life.  Have found absolutely NO benefit from 4G function.- Facebook.  Pointless app. Can't access own profile page.  Error always says NULL FETCHING DATA- Texting - horrible qwerty screen.  Cannot for the life of me figure out what is so hard about programming a phone to type the actual word you are trying to type.- No on-screen alert that you have received calls- Stupid android cartoon when calls come in cannot be removed- Bad sound quality. Everyone sounds muffled.- Getting an Iphone. I hate saying that because Steve Jobs was a jerk.
