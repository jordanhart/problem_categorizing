First off' ..I love my Prada by LG cell phone!! It feels very sleek and quality based when held in your hand. It has definitely been a conversation piece every time someone notices the Prada label on the back of the device.What makes owing a device such as the Prada by LG so amazing, is the exclusiveness of having one. There hasn't been one person to date that I personal came across or heard of that owns a designer cell phone. It defiantly gives you the prestige (if your into high end, quality items) that you want.Aside from the well enjoyed physical appearance of my Prada, I must say the 4.0 ice cream sandwich OS is quite the feature to have. It gives the device all the tools it needs to maintain productivity and performance, while keeping you fashionable. The front camera captures you in the best light ever, no matter how you look. A big thanks to the developers for including the \"beautiful skin\" option.The only downfall of the device, is the battery life spand. If you don't keep your display screen brightness on the lowest settings, it tends to shorten the battery life really quickly. I work in Real Estate so, having a full charged cell phone is crucial. Besides that, I encourage everyone to invest, gift or own a designer phone. It's sets you apart from the common expectations of others.Last but not least, the service leading up to receiving my phone. Unfortunately, I was one of those shoppers who made online purchases on Black Friday who hasn't received their shipment as promised. However, to make a long story short, I was given a ETA of receiving my order before Christmas but ended up receiving it on New Years Eve.After corresponding with Scharter Store,  I was pleasantly surprised on how they handled my situation. At first I was taken back by their first email response to my concern of not receiving my order on time. They offered me two choices, First choice was a refund of $20.00 for the delay with the option for me to wait until the original shipment arrives (which they could not locate) Second choice was to cancel my order with a full refund.Quite honestly, I was not interested in either option that was offered. I originally found it to be insensitive and offensive. However, I was surprised with the next day option that they provided me. It was a $20.00 refund, plus a expedited shipment of a new order (which they claimed at first, there warehouse was out of stock) . Being heard and having my concerns respected with a positive compromised defiantly assured me that I was dealing with a good company.Would I recommend Scharter Store - YES! Would I recommend getting the Prada by LG- YES!!!", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dead Battery after 2 months!", "Author": "M.

I'd say this industrial design on it is awesome, however the Prada-inspired skin/flavor of Android 2.3.7 Gingerbread is not great.
