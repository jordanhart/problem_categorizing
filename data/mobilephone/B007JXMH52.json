Jennings", "ReviewID": "R39NHALA7DLT2N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First off I can say that this is a really great phone, large screen, great reponse time, and very sleek looking. i purchased this phone originally hoping it would be new. When I recieved it I could tell it was a refurbished phone then on top of that the power button doesn't work.Not only did I pay, and was promised, a new phone. I recieved a used and broken one for a new phone price. I have tried to contact the seller AEG wireless numerous times for a refund but they have not answer back any of my emails. I have now contacted amazon about the matter and luckily I work at amazon so I know the matter will be dealt with. Bottom line... Do not buy from AEG wireless, they are so unprofessional.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the phone", "Author": "Star", "ReviewID": "R36C7X0GW6CRZD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this phone a lot!
