My wife and I have had four in the past four years (original buys from Verizon, warranty replacements, separate used purchase), and every one has been rendered useless when the right hinge broke. Even the people at my local Verizon store have admitted that it is a basic design error - even they wouldn't do anything about it once outside of the warranty.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "jspain1986", "ReviewID": "R3N7IRNQA2H8B4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because my LG got water damage...it arrived quickly and has been a great little phone to use!

Would definitely recommend this phone and the seller.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "What the phone is, and how 3 turned out: 4 years owning it", "Author": "Tim the enchanter", "ReviewID": "RBQ2KL2P7PQ3M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I used this phone for 2 and a half years before I upgraded and decided to keep this one as a backup. It worked great all throughout the time of its usage. It then went into storage for about a year and a half, never used. My girlfriend then broke her phone so I gave her this one to use and she loves it now too. Not in the \"its got all sorts of awesome features and can do so much cool stuff!\" kind of way, but in the \"its reliable, and of good quality in what a phone NEEDS to do\" sort of way.There is not much to tell about this phone. It does everything basic that you need. Whether it be texting, calling, or simply writing down a note real quick that you need to remember, or a calendar reminder, its got you covered. Its also got an alarm so you can use this instead of an actual alarm clock. It has picture and video capabilities as well. However understand this is an old phone and only has a 1 megapixel camera... In other words the quality isn't that great. Especially for videos, they look pretty poorly. Picture are decent though.The only way this phone stands out is the three buttons on the front.. If you take a close look those buttons are skip, back, and play/pause for music. So if you need a music player this phone works great for it. Its also got good speakers on it (compared to other phones) its also louder than regular phones, should you need it. However unlike newer phones this phone does not have a headphone jack. To hear its music you must use its speakers built into it. There is a small jack on the side that LOOKS like a headphone jack but a lot smaller, not sure what its for so it may be possible to get an adapter to use headphones.All in all I've loved this phone. I would give it 5 stars on my own personal experience, however my mom and little sister also got this phone so I must give justice to the overall quality of this phone. My mom, little sister and me all got this phone at the same time. Within one week my little sister had dropped and  broken hers, and to replace it it was \"policy\" for Verizon to force give us insurance which added 5$ a month to it, which made me pretty mad at them since it was only a week old. She didn't have problems after that until the end of her contract when her battery had died and could only last a few hours. My moms was good like mine, lasted the whole 2 years, however her battery also died quickly as well. Only mine lasts there, and that is because I use a recharging technique to keep batteries lasting long.By the way, this technique is to FULLY charge the battery, then use it until it FULLY dies, then fully charge again, and repeat, this maximizes battery life. While my moms and little sisters phones only lasts a day on a full charge, mine lasts a week. It lasted about 2 weeks when brand new. This is probably  good for all phones. Naturally you cannot ALWAYS do this but if you can manage it most of the time it could make the difference between a week or a day of battery life when the phone turns 2 years old. In this phones case at least that did make a huge difference, however in my new phone that is not the case. Again, my little sis and mom's new phones only last a day, but mine lasts about 3, it depends on the model how well this works.My little sister broke it immediately when it fell off her lap, out of the car, and onto the pavement, breaking the screen. If you are not an accident-prone person, and don't want something fancy, but just a good, reliable, simple, phone. I highly recommend this one. My mom and little sister still have theirs as backups should they need it. However its simplicity and lack of uses would make anyone who wants a fancy phone bored in about a day. You could probably spend about an hour to 2 hours testing everything it can do and then you can already be done with EVERYTHING it is capable of.Also, when I got the phone Verizon gave it 1 month free V-cast and internet. Both are very slow and not very usable. Not a phone for data, avoid this phone if you want internet because its not up to the job. Talk, text, music is what it does best. It does these well, and reliably. However it lacks all the innovations of the last 4 years and for most it can be considered an \"outdated\" phone. Because of that, I dock it another star to total 3 stars. Odds are it will disappoint if you want new technology. For me personally, who just wants a phone to be used for talk, text, a watch, and alarm clock, it does great. 5 stars for me, but gets 3 stars after all aspects are considered.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Transaction", "Author": "mandy09", "ReviewID": "R3MVMNWJ06M42N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The transaction went smoothly and we got our product 4 days after we purchased it.
