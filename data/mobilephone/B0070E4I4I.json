Its quick, its easy to understand, and it does its job as a phone. I'm speaking from previous experience, but i gave the phone i received a four star because, unfortunately, there was a small crack on the screen and a few scratches( no biggie, I guess). It still works perfectly, it still serves its primary function as a phone, and its palm sized! This phone also has a sliding feature, so when you slide it up you have a keypad. This phone is still awesome =]", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "WON'T DO IT AGAIN!!!", "Author": "WON'T DO IT AGAIN!!!", "ReviewID": "R3F2X32DOFV2DR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "WITHIN 4 DAYS OF HAVING THE PHONE THE \"TOUCH\" SCREEN QUIT WORKING!!!
