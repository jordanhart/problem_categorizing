{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Smartphone from Sony!", "Author": "Lui Lai \"Alan\"", "ReviewID": "R3SEULIJDYWI8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The particular Xperia S I bought is a German Generic unbranded unlocked one.The manufacturing date and code is 12W15 ABAE. Which means no LCD yellow tint issues.There are tons of video reviews around the internet so you can google that.Sony just started the ICS 4.0.4 update for Xperia S. After the update I feel like its a new phone!Most Android fans will tell you that this phone does not have the most cutting-edge hardware, i.e. quad-core CPUs..etc...etc..But in normal daily usage and gaming you won't feel the differences between dual-core and quad-core.At least Xperia S has a unique design, 12MP Camera with Sony Exmor R sensor, highest DPI LCD screen.Hardware gets obsolete very fast, but a good design and good looking phone can last much longer.Of course Xperia S has its cons as every phone in the market. Currently I don't feel its cons out-weight its pros and its uniqueness.Just remember get one with the first two digits of manufacturing code at least AB, not AA.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Phone I Ever Owned.", "Author": "HH", "ReviewID": "R1G762WBHUVU6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is awesome. The screen is amazing, and I haven't even peeled off the screen protector that makes it look matte. Camera looks good. Feels solid. Loud speakers. The battery is the only problem, have to charge at the end of the day but it lasts pretty well for me unless you spend the whole day downloading apps. For some reason the phone turns off overnight when I wake up the battery is dead. I think I need to turn off WiFi when I go to sleep because WiFi uses about 11% of the battery. Overall, best phone I've ever used.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony Xperia S (LT26i)", "Author": "KumaNeko", "ReviewID": "R2XF5TQKW9BTHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything went smoothly. The package came in a nice internally bubble padded UPS bag. And the phone box came in on time was in perfect condition. Everything about the phone is just right and perfect. I looked up the phone a lot before I made the purchase and knew everything about it and knew what to expect from the phone and its features. I purchased it from FGS Trading and everything came in perfect condition. The phone works exactly how I expected it to. A limited number of Xperia S's had a overheating problem which caused a yellowish tint on the screen, but I didn't have that issue with my phone. Although the phone didn't have any power out of the box so I had to leave it on the charger for a bit before my first time turning it on. Otherwise, it's all good and it's still running strong for me.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stylish but Flawed Device", "Author": "Curtis", "ReviewID": "R3J0H3AUCGB13C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Xperia S is a stunning phone to look at. Having already read plenty of reviews and familiarized myself with the weak points of the device before purchasing it, I was ready to deal with the inconvenience of less-than-responsive buttons on the Android navigation bar, and a spotty experience updating and maintaining the device via my Mac.However, ultimately, I ended up re-selling the device and returning to a vanilla Android 4.1.1 experience on my Galaxy Nexus.Pros:- Stunning, rich, dense display, good overall system performance- Excellent \"theme\" -- not invasive, and very stylish (if you like a themed experience...). I enjoyed lot of the widget behavior improvements and the overall \"feel\" of the themed OS under my finger.- Sony's Walkman music app is awesome, and I was able to find a good Last.fm scrobbler to support it.Cons:- Very poor battery life (half-day in my experience) with a built-in non-replaceable battery- No HSPA+ support on T-Mobile Network so it was \"Edge\" network or nothing here in the US. I'm told that if I were using a SIM from AT&T;, I would have had access to 3G. However, stepping from very fast \"4G / faux-G\" (HSPA+) T-Mobile coverage, all the way down to ether 2G, or 3G -- both options felt impossibly inferior and hard to tollerate.- Though this phone was recently updated to Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich, the upgrade via Sony's proprietary software on my Mac failed a number of times, and was a hassle even when it worked. Also, this is *still* not the current version of Android. The device will always lag behind Google-updated devices in terms of OS version.- \"Playstation Certified\" means nothing. There were about six games to choose from, and the experience was not good on this device -- which did not even come with the Playstation Market installed. Playing the titles via a huge swath of dodgy on-screen buttons that cover most of the game action was totally sub-par. It is a better experience to rip and play your own PS1 titles via an emulator on any other Android device. I had fooled myself into thinking that if I bought a \"Playstation Certified\" device, there would be more working titles or a better gameplay experience, but that really wasn't the case. Imagining that I'd be playing Xenogears, Final Fantasy, Grandia, Lunar... all my old favorite PS1 RPGs, was the thing I most looked forward to about this device when I purchased it, however none of those titles were available. In fact, Wild Arms was the only RPG option.- Patchy software support via the Google Play Store was troubling -- nobody tests for the device, so you have to be ready to see apps behaving in nonstandard ways.If I were an AT&T; customer, a Windows user, and a non-gamer with a desk job so I could charge the device during the day -- I might have stayed with this device. If the above describes you, this is indeed a very sexy-looking device.My advice is to confirm what network you will be operating on before you buy. Just because it's \"GSM\" doesn't mean you'll have a great experience on some networks. This is not a junk device -- it is very high-quality and it is obvious that Sony has put it's best foot forward, but there were a number of things that ultimately held my experience back to the point that I chose to move on.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT PRODUCT.", "Author": "Sable Arachnid", "ReviewID": "R35OT8AZSDJ3L8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought my Xperia S from FGS trading.

The design is perfect, hardware quality is of high level. Over all it worth the price. I'll just mention some negative things about it:1. Battery life is probably the most obvious problem. Even compared with IPhone 4's short battery life, this Experia S has a even shorter battery life than expected. It can only last between 10-15 hours for normal use, therefore I have to charge it every night. although basically you have to charge every smart phone daily, you'll still encounter short battery problem if you happens to use the phone more frequently someday.2. the back cover cannot be tightly installed. This is not a big problem though, but it makes me feel the product not considerately designed.3. The high-contrast scree: this is just not that appeal to me since I'd prefer a natural screen color. this screen is just too colorful to be unreal.4. the operating system: some bugs, which I don't know if all Android devices have more bugs than IOS. Some bugs are just irritating and stupid, e.g., the power saving mode never correctly functioned on my device, or sometimes the system crashed when opening email, etc. Frankly speaking i don't think system update would resolve these problem.

Unique and stylish design. The transparent bar really shines in a low-light situation such as a restaurant or club.2. 12 MP camera, with a few apps this can produce very nice looking photos. The low light performance of the camera is a little bit on the noisy side, but a modded HDR camera app fixed the quality of the image very nicely.3. Dedicated camera button. This is very useful in many situations.4. Good speakers.5. mini HDMI port. Good for when you need to connect to external screen.6. Matte body and special finish. The chemically treated finish on the body makes it easy to wipe smudges and other marks off. Also, plastic body means that screen will be less likely to shatter if dropped. Does dent though.7. Very bright and sharp screen. I can easily see the screen outside in direct sunlight and at a angle. One of the highest ppi LCD screens as well.Cons:1. Power button is located at the top right corner of the phone. This makes it a bit awkward to press. The button placement on the phone is a little bit awkward in general.2. Capacitive buttons above the transparent LED bar is not super responsive unless you press it at exactly the right spot. This can take a bit of getting used to, but it is a source of frustration.3. No Android 4.0 (ICS) out of the box. This can be fixed via an update.4. Outdated hardware. The Xperia S has a S3 chip instead of the S4, so it's not as fast as other flagship android phones such as Samsung Galaxy S3, Nexus 4, or HTC One X.5. A unibody deisgn would've been nice since the battery is non-removable anyway. This would eliminate the gaps in the phone where dust can enter.6. Phone gets sluggish after a while if too many apps are open.

I have a Vaio, PSP, PS3, 2 Cybershots, 2 Sony headphones and a Sony television so the Xperia was basically the last Sony product to complete my Sony family... I used to have an iPhone so I might make some comparisons between those two.Pros:First off, the cellphone is amazingly beautiful and the screen looks amazing; you have to see it to believe it. However, the screen makes pictures sometimes look \"too\" nice. I took pictures with this phone and it looked amazing on screen, however I uploaded it on my computer and I was kind of disappointed. hahaha but the screen is amazing to watch videos. I love the dedicated camera button on the side so I don't have to turn on the phone and go to the camera to bring up the camera. In addition, the matte back of the phone looks very nice. There is an LED light in the front that flashes when you have a notification and the color of the light is the color of the app, which is VERY cool. Purple for Yahoo Mail, Blue for Facebook, Green for Whatsapp/LINE/WeChat, etc etc.Cons:I love how Android phones can be customizable so I decided to customize the heck out of the UI in the phone. However, this led to the phone being a bit slow, so I don't know if it is the fact that I am using the GO Launcher Ex that is making the phone slow, if I am running too many apps, or if the phone is a bit slower than the iPhone in general... I was kind of disappointed in that. In addition, the camera crashes sometimes which bothers me because I like to take a LOT of pictures. Unfortunately, the phone does not come with a music player program so I had to download one, but when locking the phone, it's just not as convenient as iPhone's double click on the home button to bring up the music player. (If anyone has any free music player download recommendations w/ a good lock screen player mode, please tell me!) Also, the bottom 3 buttons are not as sensitive as I would like; I have to press the buttons a couple of times sometimes for it to register.Overall:The phone is very nice looking. It is very eye catching and my friends ask me what kind of phone is it when they see it. (Not a lot of people know I guess, but I like to be special hahaah) The screen is the best part of this phone and the speakers are very loud when you want them to be. The S is running on Gingerbread but Sony is coming out with Ice Cream for S sometime next year I hope. Hopefully this will make the phone faster!

Here some of its most infamous fails: **The 3 capacitive buttons are very insensitive and inaccurate... You need to tap 3 to 4 times to get it works. A real nightmare!!! **Data connection HSDPA freezes suddenly 1 or 2 times daily..... You need to turn off and turn on data in settings to get it work again. (Occurs the same with differents sims operators and configs). **It takes 7 to 8 hours to fully charge, even turned off (I don't know why..:S). **Battery drains in less than 10 hours with very low usage.I will never buy a SONY phone in my life..... I will come back to Samsung or HTC! -------------------------------------------------------Compilation Num: 6.0.A.3.75Android: 2.3.7 (After two months of Sony announced the ICS 4 upgrading, There's nothing for this phone until today).", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.99", "Features": "Cellular Band - Quad-Band 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 Mhz\nCellular Band 3G - 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100", "Name": "Sony Ericsson Xperia S LT26i White 32Gb WiFi Android Unlocked 3G Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31dMIM7BIKL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007HJLCDG"}}
