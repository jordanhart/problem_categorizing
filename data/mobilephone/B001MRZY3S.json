It is quad-band and GSM phone which means it has a removable sim card that I can use a pay as you go sim card when I go back to the UK, and then switch it back while back in the US. Unfortunately your limited to AT&T; or T-Mobile in the US as the other carriers don't use GSM phones, not sure why?.  The phone itself which I bought in the UK has an adapter for 110/220v for charging in other countries which is a nice touch from LG (I once fried a US adapter by plugging it into a UK socket, duh!). It comes with a screen protector and the casing feels nice and not too cheap. The touch screen itself is bright and easy to navigate and the inclusion of a stylus that fits in the base of the phone makes it very handy when texting. The phone houses a slot for a micro SD card up to 8gb, which is ample for mp3's and photo's or video's. I don't like that you have to use the supplied headphones in order to listen to music as they aren't that good and would have preferred the ability to use third party phones.Camera quality isn't that great, but like most phone cameras the quality is grainy, I only use it rarely as I have a good quality digital camera for that.  Overall it's a great little phone that is considerably cheaper and less bulkier than the i phone. And if you need accessories then eBay is the place to go, I picked up a great leather case that fits perfectly, and a car charger. I have had the phone now for 7 months and am pleased with it so far.Update: I recently flashed the phones firmware to the latest version which is V10n and the phone is so much better.The touch screen works a lot better than before and the slide bar can now be used without having to press hard.The firmware install is a little tricky and can only be done on a windows operating system, but is well worth the time as the phone's performance is so much better.

Will not use it for the 'net & haven't tried the camera yet. Edit 4/15 - I like the camera, it works great & pics are clear, with fun editing options. With that said, I absolutely love this phone! It has the functions I was looking for and more. It has many features all explained in detail in the thick booklet it comes with...thanks to LG...I suggest reading it thoroughly with phone in hand to check it all out. It has lots of -helpful tips- & many features with detailed information.It came with a charger for 100-240v and an adapter that fits well. It's all you need to charge in the US or in other countries. More accessories are included but I suggest -not- trying the screen protector they added separately since it has residue AND it's a bit thick which would make the touch screen less responsive. Also ---> the phone already has a screen protector on it when you take it out the box (the right kind of protector for touch screen), so if you look closely you can tell it's there and no need to remove or replace it. Just wipe clean when needed.This phone looks a lot nicer then it appears in the pic shown. It has good quality hardware and easy to hold on to, not slippery. The touch screen looks really nice & is very responsive & brings up the menu or whatever you need quickly. Mine does anyway, and there are settings for every thing (I do mean every thing) so you can adjust to your preference. Easy, intuitive, & has many features that make it so nice and capable of doing a lot.Edit (4-11-10) -- Someone else reviewed saying they could only listen to music with the headphones, but... that's if you start from the widget. If you access your music from the entertainment section instead, you can play it loud and clear w/o the headphones & the info as well as cover art appears on the screen. :)The side scroll bar takes some getting use to but it works well after practicing a bit. Edit 4/15 - sliding the bar from fingernail works better. The backlights longest time for inactivity is 60 seconds, but you can just press the on/off button once and it will be back on & in the same screen/function you were using. That's all minor stuff imo. I got more then I expected for the current price and with a year warranty from cell concepts (ordering directly from Amazon), it is a great deal in my opinion.I use T-Mobile and pay as you go service. I find this phone to be reliable & -not- a cheap quality cell that the phone companies offer w/o a contract. An unlocked 'non-branded' phone is much better then a phone directly from the phone companies & retail stores. What I mean by non-branded is, for example, AT&Ts; name is not on the hardware, only the manufacturer...like LG is on this phone. I have had an LG flip phone for the past 6 years & it still works, I just wanted to try a newer more functional phone and this one is very nice.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "One of the Best, most inexpensive unlocked phones.", "Author": "Saren", "ReviewID": "R2BE33Z9G8GVHE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a new phone for the last year, since my old T-Mobile Blast was becoming outdated. So, when I took a trip to Germany and found the LG KP500 there, I was quite curious. I looked up reviews here on Amazon, and after some consideration, bought the phone from a German electronics retailer... And I am sure glad that I did!Let's get started with the Pros and the Cons of this phone.PROS:-Unlocked, Quadband World Phone.-Inexpensive. I bought the phone for 89, which is comparable to the price here on Amazon.-Good Quality. Although the phone is small and made of plastic, it has an extremely durable feel.-Signal Quality. I normally have no signal with T-Mobile's To-Go plan in my house, but I usually have at least 3 bars with this phone. By comparison, my last three phones constantly lost signal in my house.-Great features. Many features, including a Movie editor, 3MP Camera, Music Player, Video Recorder, Games, Accelerometer, and drawing pad.-Stylus. Not really necessary, but it really helps with texting and making notes.-Multiple Apps and Task Manager. You can run more than one app at a time, like Music Player and Camera-Widgets. On the home page, there is a selection of widgets to choose from. These include: Music Player, World Clock, Clock, Calender, FM Radio, and Notepad.-Speed Dial Widgets. With a swipe of the finger, the home page changes to a speed dial home page with up to 10 contacts and images.-Downloadable Apps and Games. The phone is Java based, so you can download .JAR apps from a number of sites to transfer to the phone.-Expandable Memory via microSD slot (Up to 8gb)CONS:-The interface, while very sleek and refined, can become slow due to multiple apps running at once.-Texting in QWERTY format is a bet annoying at first, due to the small keyboard. But after a while, you get used to it.My recommendation: If you are looking for a new, unlocked phone at a cheap price, the LG KP500 is for you.NOTE: I own the silver version of this phone, which doesn't have the rubbery texture.UPDATE 10/2010-The phone is still working great. I actually received an update from T-Mobile to allow MMS messaging and internet web-browsing, so the phone is actually better now than it was 6 months ago! Plus, after accidentally dropping it face first into concrete, it still works with no scratches!

It has some nice features, but the negatives far outweigh the positives.  I knew going into it that there was no multimedia texting capability and that the web browser was shoddy, but I was at least expecting to be able to send a text message quickly.  The proprietary LG headphones are also a pain:  they're uncomfortable, the sound quality is mediocre at best, and their durability is questionable.  Make sure to order an adapter or spare headphones, since mine already broke and I have to wait for new ones to come in.If it wasn't for the fact that the touch screen makes this phone almost unusable, I would have happily given it at least 3 stars.

I slipped my SIM card in (I have T-Mobile Even More service) and it immediately recognized T-Mobile as the carrier; even shows it onscreen!Spent approximately 20 minutes playing around with the settings as they are organized a bit differently from U.S. phones...for instance, the settings for ring tones are under the \"Settings-Profile-Normal\" names, not the usual ones we see here.  However, it's pretty easy and the touchpad appears to become more responsive with time as you get used to it.The QWERTY keyboard is great and the accelerometer function works quite well for typing with either [small] fingers or the stylus.  People have received my texts promptly, as I have theirs.  Anyone considering this phone would do well to check the services their provider offers - if you don't have an Internet plan, well, the phone won't surf the 'Net - I say this because I've seen a couple of complaints about that issue.  I don't use my phone for that purpose, just calls and texting, and it's perfectly suited for such.  Also, this is NOT a wi-fi or 3G equipped phone, which again suits my needs but perhaps not others...they'll have to spend a bit more for that and sacrifice battery life.  Speaking of battery life, I am a fairly heavy talker and only charge my phone every 3-4 days - and it charges in less than a couple hours.All in all, if you're patient and like to fiddle with new gadgets as I do, you will LOVE this phone.

The first thing I like about the phone is that it is really, really, really light weight. It has a good solid feel to the palm and won't suffer that much cosmetic damage. The phone came with a screen protector so that was nice.  I didn't want to spend more than a $100 dollars because all I do is text and call people. With that said, if you do not use internet or don't have a data plan, then this is an okay phone. If you do use a data plan, don't even think about buying this phone, it only uses the Edge network and not 3G. The phone came with a pre-installed firmware version 'KP500AT-V10F'. This firmware is pretty damn slow, so I had to flash the phone to the V10G_00 version. All the tutorials can be found on forums or youtube, just search it. With the new firmware, the texting is 10x better and overall speed in navigating through folders is much better as well. SO UPDATE THE FIRMWARE IF YOU GET THIS PHONE! In addition, a huge con is the amount of confirmation popups whenever you change something. For instance, trying to delete your text messages would follow this order: 'Delete selected?' ----> 'Deleting...\" ----> 'Deleted'. That is really annoying and unnecessary. The call quality is pretty good, and it's bluetooth ready.  The camera is okay when there is a lot of light, if there is no light, the image quality is similar to the 'sepia' effect, yeah, its that bad. Overall, I am satisfied with this phone due to the call quality and price, but the biggest cons are definitely the initial firmware, the processing speed, and lackluster camera quality. As for music, it is loud, but who really uses their phone for an mp3 player. The phone also holds 500 total texts, 250 in inbox and outbox, more or less. All in all, if you don't want to be frustrated with the phone's speed, then update the firmware right when you get it.ALSO: THIS PHONE IS ABLE TO SEND AND RECEIVE MMS, DO NOT LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS!

It gets great reception, even better than my old V3 RAZR, which I thought had excellent reception.  Call quality is also very good.I love the touchscreen!  I won't go back to a non-touchscreen phone after this.  It's so much easier to navigate through the menus and get it to do what I want.  Yes, texting is a little more difficult.  But, all the positives of the touchscreen outweigh that negative.  And, I text quite a bit.I have At&T; in the U.S. and I was able to get MMS and internet services to work right away.

I could have gone with a basic model (my other option was basically the Samsung B3310 but that's more of a kid's phone and it didn't appeal to me), but decided to try something slightly flashier.I had my doubts about the touchscreen for texting but I'm MUCH faster after just a day. I realize that the phone won't compare to a hard qwerty keypad or to a high quality capacitive touch screen (iPhone or Droid), but once you're used to it, it does the job well. The phone isn't perfectly fast but you don't have to wait more than a second for anything to load (as long as you don't burden the home screen with a shortcut to hundreds of image files).Great mid-range phone. Not 5 stars because there are better, but I'm convinced that it's the best in its price range. MMS was easy to set up, and I'm sure internet is too (not a feature I use).Also, T9 is a great fast way to text if you can't use the qwerty keyboard. The texting does lag a little bit but if you're looking for a perfect device you won't get it for $100 flat. I have BEAR CLAWS for hands, though. It took some getting used to but mistakes are almost nonexistent now. If you hate learning new things, this isn't the phone for you, but give it a week and some experimentation and you'll be fine.No idea how it'll stand up to long term use in terms of bugs and hardware failures, but most people complain about the features rather than bugs. Like other users, I have noticed words being deleted, now that I think about it. I didn't even notice at first, I suppose, and I think it may have something to do with the predictive feature on the qwerty keypad.

I was only able to view some pages but could read my e-mail, that's it. No watching you tube or any videos, no listening to AOL Music or other streaming media. I mentioned this to Vibe Cellular, the internet access problem, they suggested calling t-mobile and LG for assistance, which did help fopr what it was worth. I bought this thinking it was FULLY compatible with T-Mobile...I figured, what the heck, who needs internet anyway...The phone came with a round prong charger (European 50 cycle type), with no adapter. I ordered a separate charger (through Amazon) which didn't fully charge the phone.I also didn't receive the 8gb card which I ordered and paid for. I instead received a 2gb card. Both of these issues were later resolved by Vibe Cellular after I contacted them.When the phone was able to receive a full charge more issues began showing up.The phone locked after appx.15 seconds of being idle. I repeatedly changed the settings to allow 1 minute(this was the longest time available in options), but the phone didn't change, it still locked up after a few seconds. I also had trouble sending and receiving messages. I contacted T-Mobile and thought that the issue was solved after taking appx.  30 minutes and 2 different T-Mobile agents to figure out how to fix it.I couldn't always send messages, sometimes I could but... can't explain other than to say that there was no rhyme or reason for this? I would send a message to someone, be in conversation, then all the sudden an error appeared???I began getting an ERROR 15 notification, maybe a dozen times a day ?I am not sure if all of the notifications were the same because my screen wouldn't unlock in time for me to read them?I only Know that I was constantly hearing the ERROR notification (the ones that I did get to read indicated delivery errors had occured, \"message couldn't be sent\")I would continually get more notifications asking if I wanted to continue to attempt to 're-send' the message.I hit the 'cancell' option but it didn't do any good. A few minutes later I would see that option again, and more than likely I would 'cancel' again...If you like going in circles, this is the phone for you !!! Also the screen became increasingly harder to 'wake' up or navigate.I would use the stylus because my fingers would sometimes hit the wrong button, even though I calibrated the screen more than once or twice. very frustrating to try to scroll down your contact list when the page won't move with your finger and you end up hitting the wrong contact...this is why I thought the stylus would help, but I was wrong. I would use the stylus to push the 'down' arrow but the screen wouldn't acknowledge the touch...It got to the point that I didn't even attempt to call anyone from the contact list, unless they happened to be on the first page!I guess the phone forced me into memorizing a lot of phone numbers...The screen also required more force to operate. A simple touch wouldn't always work.The new 8gb card was nice. I downloaded a bunch of music. BUT, Here is another issue.I like to set my phone up so that each of my contacts has a different song. The phone allowed this only a small percentage  of the time.I didn't understand that either, since All of the music was in the same format and all appeared to be fine when I editted the ringtones... but when the contact called, a different (default) ring tone would play...but not on every one, some of the sounds I actually applied...yeah...this COOKIE had some big crumbs...Finally.I was working last week when I heard the phone (which was safely stowed in it's protective holster at my side) giving the usual beep alerts, probably ERROR 15, but who knows ???When I was able to I pulled the phone out to check the alerts.To my surprise the LCD front looked very weird with lines all through it.As I put my finger on it to 'wake it' 'unlock it', the screen image looked as if my finger was breaking a glass. There were lines all through it and impossible to read anything !!!The good news is, it still receives calls !!!I contacted Vibe Cellular, but this was their response. (keep in mind that I didn't get the right charger or the larger 8gb card until many weeks after originally receiving this junk phone...It's funny that the ERROR 15, and other ERRORS, didn't really show up until I began using the 'correct' charger which charged the phone 5 x's better that the old one, and added the 8gb card...could this be why they weren't shipped originally?I was at minimum hoping that Vibe Cellular would offer to work out some deal...I mean I spent $[...] on this practically useless peice of garbage...Here is their reply...[...]Sincerely,Izzy", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for what we do with it", "Author": "P.

The phone also has a way of phoning people while in my pocket...Another thing about this phone, in case they are thinking about buying this phone, it does not have a keyboard of any sorts, except the touchscreen one.

The screen wouldn't respond anymore and getting it fixed would cost about $60-100, the price of a new phone, so I took the leap and bought the Cookie instead.As someone who has used a touch screen phone for a while, I'm not too impressed by the features of the LG Cookie. If this is your first smart phone, you won't notice the shortcomings. This product does give you quite a bang for your buck. Its best feature is probably its camera and photo editing functions. For those of you who like taking pictures with your cell phone, the image touch-up tools are very advanced and plentiful.However, I use this phone mostly for texting, calling, and organizing daily events--areas in which it has been a let-down. I loved the texting feature on my Samsung Star that automatically shifted the keyboard so that it would be horizontal (like that of a computer/laptop), but the Cookie's motion sensor is very poor and it usually takes me a few tries to get the sideways keyboard to pop up. According to my boyfriend, the call volume from my end is very poor (a big problem because we're hundreds of miles apart). Lastly, the calendar widget is very similar to that of the Star, but it has way too many fields that require input before you can finish entering a simple event.Those of you who like widgets will be a little disappointed as the Cookie has a minimal attitude towards displaying superfluous applications. The games that came with the phone were visually appealing. There is a good array of ringtones to choose from, but the wallpaper/theme selection is sparse.

It is small; about the size of a wallet and much thinner and lighter.  There is a stylus pen at the base of the phone.  The instruction booklet that came with my phone was not only in English; it also had a multitude of other languages.  The flip side of this is that the instructions in each language weren't very detailed and honestly, I could have used a bit more help.By default, the wall charger is a non-US plug, but there is an adapter to use in the US.  There is also a cord to go from the phone to the computer (USB).The phone itself is pretty much limited to calling and texting.  I knew the camera was nothing to write home about, and my expectations were very low for this camera.  This is good-- since even though this is the highest MP camera I have ever used in a mobile phone, it takes (by far) the worst pictures of any camera phone.It takes a little fiddling, but the phone has to be manually set up to accept/send MMS (picture messages) with T-Mobile.  (check the T-Mobile user forums for the correct setup).  As someone else has pointed out, T-Mobile texted me some instructions on setting up MMS messaging, but after three weeks.  I didn't switch; there really is no need to.  (Officially, T-Mobile doesn't support this phone, so why they would care how the phone is set up is beyond me!)The pictures tend to be small, but as I noted earlier, I am using this for phone/text and this doesn't matter to me.The most aggravating thing about this phone is the amount of time it takes to 'tilt' to the landscape mode while texting.  Rarely it's fast; most of the time it's okay and a few times I get aggravated and manually change the keyboard myself.  Another note on the keyboard-- I have regularly-sized fingers and yet still use the stylus since when I try to type, I usually hit the wrong letter.Since this is an international edition of the phone and not a US version there are some minor changes:--Dates are presented in DD MM YYYY format;--The ! key is hidden under the second level keyboard characters, but there are other characters I've never seen before now: a 'W' with a line through it is one example.--The word 'dialing' has been spelled 'dialling'.I must say that the color on the screen is absolutely wonderful; one of the top two phone screens I've seen.  I really was (pleasantly) surprised by this.I do recommend this phone for others looking for just a phone that texts and dials.  If you are looking for an internet phone, I would not choose this one.  However, I would choose this mobile phone all over again.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Should have waited one week", "Author": "BB", "ReviewID": "R19EJ1PPDKURYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I only buy unlocked cell phones and simply drop in my prepaid SIM card. The Speaker in my Motorola L7 was going bad and I had to  use the speakerphone setting just to hear the phone normally. So I was looking for a slightly better, more sophisticated phone. A semi-smart phone. This Cookie fit the bill perfectly. Its only slightly larger than the Motorola L7 and actually fits in the L7's case. I was apprehensive about buying this phone because it received a few really bad reviews. I took a chance and I'm GLAD I did. The only complaint I have is, in order to answer the phone several separate finger strokes are required. The instructions could be better but are for the most part adequate. The phone is fairly easy to navigate and intuitive. The camera isn't to bad (I haven't used the video yet). My only big complaint is if you store your phone book info in the phone as well as the SIM Card the phone book info is listed twice on the phones display. I would like to have WI-FI but I knew this feature was missing. I don't have a data plan so I can't say how well it surf's the web or how easy or difficult it is to read your eMail. I paid $133.00 for this phone and one week later it went on sale AGAIN for $99.00. Im very pleased with this phone even though I paid $34.00 more than I could have if I had procrastinated. You can listen to your music using the built in speaker, however if you use the radio feature you'll need to use the supplied earbuds because the antenna is in the earbud wire. Its a nonstandard plug, BTW. I now need reading glasses and you can magnify your \"Phonebook\" which is convenient but sadly none of the other displays can be enlarged. I've taken pictures of my family and friends and assigned their photos to their phone numbers ( the instruction book is weak on describing this feature) so when they call their picture pops up on the display. I would definitely buy this phone again.", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Too many problems!", "Author": "Tucker Cox", "ReviewID": "R2O9ILXT9RD2TK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "<!--\n\nfunction

For whatever it costs an equivalent android with capacitive touchscreen can be found for its price; really shouldn't be selling for more than 25 USD.*June 23, 2012 Update - The phone has issues staying paired with any bluetooth devices. It will often require a full reset to repair the bluetooth connection otherwise it will display as connected but the call will be through the handset, not the bluetooth. Since the time of original review the price of the handset has increased substantially while it remains old technology; there are way better deals out there at this time. You should not purchase this for more than ninety USD flat.Original Review:I needed a small form factor handset with a bit of style that could perform simple tasks such as mp3/video, picture MMS, casual web browsing, and not cost me an arm or leg.See, all big carriers in the US are in the trend of making it MANDATORY now to have a data plan (even if you don't want one) with any 'smart phone' and they are also getting people accostumed to paying handset specific charges like Sprint's experimental 'premium data charge' tacked onto their flagship Android phones. Whatever they tell you it has nothing to do with 4G technology at all! Customers are basically subsidizing the phone for a total of $240+tax additional to anything else paid during the term of the contract including the 'discounted price' of the handset; its crazy but the other carriers will soon follow and make it the norm just like ATT gets away with crippling their data plans using their exclusive line of Apple iPhones as leverage to keep customer from migrating. (I would have left long ago but I keep traveling far off to strange places!)Getting back to the LG Cookie, it is truly a thing to behold in light of its price to value ratio. Only cons are limited functionality during phone calls (wether you use bluetooth or not) such as not being able to activate the camera and no WIFI but otherwise you won't regret the purchase.To get the internet/MMS working with ATT (or other carriers) you will need the respective carrier's IP address for the APN settings (or type the URL using the stylus... no biggie!). The only bad thing about this phone is its arcane menu structure which takes some getting used to, but its all there; even some network settings you may have never heard of because these are usually removed by US carriers too.The reason this phone 'resets' and does not boot is because of people using old SIM formats that are out of date with the newest handsets. The phone refused to load with my old SIM from ATT (vintage 2007) and so I had my account assigned to a new SIM card (you can find OEM issue SIMS for sale on Amazon, carrier specific) and registered the phone's IMEI# (right behind the battery) with my account through technical support.IF you do not register you IMEI number with the carrier (like ATT!) some features such as MMS and internet will not work no mater how many times you try or what settings you use. If MMS is important to you do not forget to register your IMEI#! I fought with this failure to authenticate issue and googled for many days until I found the answer so you won't have to!Oh, the battery meter is a little deceiving and this does not charge via regular mini-USB like many other handsets. At least it does includes a USB cable for data transfer and charging if plugged to a hub or any other powered USB port/charger.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good phone, Great Value!", "Author": "Alberto Fajardo", "ReviewID": "RMUTS43IP1NX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was really the best value for you buck...

However, it does have a few problems/limitations:Touchscreen: This phone uses a resistive touchscreen as opposed to a capacitive touchscreen. The touchscreen isn't very responsive at times, which is a real annoyance. (Capacitive touchscreens, such as those on the iPhone and Blackberry Storm, are more responsive and support multi-touch gestures.)Homescreen: You can only add/remove a predefined set of widgets on the Homescreen: Calendar, Clock/Alarm, Notes, Music Player, Picture Viewer, Social Networking (My Space, Twitter, Facebook), and International Time.Single-Axis Accelerometer: The keyboard doesn't always change to a full QWERTY keyboard when you change the orientation of the phone from vertical to horizontal.Web Browser: Browsing the Web using the built-in Web Browser is a frustrating experience. The links on a page don't load at least half the time when you click on them. The page also takes a while to refresh after it's been scrolled. I downloaded and installed Opera Mini, which works flawlessly.Email: The phone can store only 300 email messages. Once the capacity is reached, you have to delete existing emails from the Inbox in order to retrieve more emails. Deleting emails is a hassle: you have to (1) select and delete emails from the Inbox (deleted emails are then placed in the Deleted folder) and (2) navigate to the Deleted folder and delete the emails again before they are finally expunged.Syncing With Outlook: I am able to sync with Outlook on my PC only through USB, not bluetooth. I get a \"Pairing setting is failed while connecting with the device [sic]\" error message with bluetooth syncing. The To Do list is barely functional -- there is no way to sort it and the subject field is only about 14 characters wide. Calendar and To Do List are limited to 500 items.FM Radio: The FM Radio only works with the earbuds (included) plugged in. The earbuds use a proprietary LG connector, not a standard 3.5mm audio plug. The sound from the earbuds is tinny.Camera & Video: The camera has no autofocus, much less zoom capability. The camera is best used for close-up shots (distant objects are blurry). The video is very choppy because of the low frame rate (12 fps).---There you have it.

I especially like the feedback from the screen when you touch or use the stylus which folds neatly into the bottom of the phone. The package includes a transparent cover for protecting the screen. Do not be put of by earlier reviews! It does have all the MMS features found on other phones. I loaded the included software and from LG's site, I was able to download the newest firmware update which speeds up the phone and opens all the features. The latest software is kp500_v10o. Calls sound good and i was able to text, browse and e mail with a few adjustments in the software. There are several web sites out there with configuaration info and there seem to be droves of people who like this phone.......you cant beat the price for what it does and how good it looks.Cons - It should come with more apps but i will remedy that very shortly,this is a minor nuisance.

What i love the most has to be the multitasking. You can listen to music and text at the same time along with a bunch of other things. I love the minimal amount of buttons because of course its a touch screen. And the built in stylus is pretty handy as well.Now i read reviews about bad music quality over the included headphones and touch screen being non responsive. But in my experience the music isn't actually that bad. I'm not the kind of person that craves that brilliant quality so it didn't really matter to me. However, it did surprise me because it really isnt as bad as people say it is. The touch screen might not be as responsive as the Iphone or Itouch but its a standard touch screen, its not that bad either, keep in mind this is a budget phone.

The microprocessor in this phone must be the slowest on earth. Everything is so slow and counterintuitive that I get upset everytime I use it. In text mode, they use the same layout as a digital phone. Why they didn't have the option of a Qwerty keyboard is beyond logic.

Be cautious if you wish to use this phone in the USA for internet, email, sending pictures, etc. Check with the seller/manufacturer to make sure.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "NOT A TEXTING PHONE", "Author": "frank_", "ReviewID": "R29TKSAAIMEK46", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone was my FIRST all-touch phone. At first, I loved it! Everything was cool, the stylus totally made it worth a phone. However, once I tried to get used to the texting, I totally hated the phone. Since it's all touch, you can't automattically have that QWERTY Format. You have to turn the phone to the side to use it, BUT SOMETIMES THAT DOESN'T WORK T__T So i'm always forced to go to menu and MANUALLY change it to \"Keyboard\" format. Seriously this is frustrating when you're in a rush or you just want to text you kno? If you're a texter, DON'T GET THIS PHONE! Get a phone with a QWERTY Board, like BLACKBERRY <3 After this phone, I've realized I cannot handle all touch when it comes to texting, It's just TOOO difficult /: AND it'll freeze sometimes when you're trying to send the texts /:So that was the texting issue. But other than that, this phone is pretty alrite for its price. MMS WORKS! You just need the right information for your network, I currently use it under TMOBILE. You do need the unlock code if you're using it for tmobile or at&t.; But that's not tough, just call the company (tmobile/at&t;) and ask them for the code. I called and was afraid they wouldn't tell me the unlock code, BUT NO they were so nice and they showed me how to unlock my phone and everything. So DON'T WORRY!! You can use this with any GSM provider in US. OH ! Also, I used this phone when I was in Asia. No unlock code necessary (: It felt nice since I didn't have to buy a cheap phone to use just for ASIA. Anyways, you'd want to know some nice features - dual screen. Meaning one screen is your 'main screen' and the other is for your speed dial. That means you can have 2 wallpapers. I love the Alarm and Calendar 'applications'!! You can change the tone to your alarm. Each individual alarm can have a diff tone. You can change when you need the alarm to repeat. OH and for the calendar, what's neat is I can easily remind myself of things I have to do. I give my events a reminder, so it rings when I need it to ring. I think those are very helpful. Eventhough my phone sucks at texting, I can use it normally for other stuff. It has a program where you can read word/text files! Music player and camera are good. Camera isn't like super great, but it's pretty decent, to me.OVERALL: If you just use your phone for calling and anything else that isn't TEXTING, then totally get this phone (: If you're a texter, then get another phone with a full QWERTY keyboard. I hope my advice helped you. Ask me if you have more questions. It's been like 11 months since I've had the phone. I get pissed at the texting, but the alarm/calendar are so helpful, I don't want to get another phone.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "5frank5", "ReviewID": "R24AWCLUCM63QN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw the negative review count and read some.

I've got to say it was a smart move, this phone is much cheaper and it has pretty much the same functions. The construction quality is very good and the unit comes with a screen protector so you don't leave your fingerprints all over the screen, which obviously will happen a lot.Luckily it also has a stylus pen, as text messaging with the virtual querty would be mission imposible without it, I have small fingers and had a hard time trying to hit those small buttons so the pen came in handy.Pros:- Small- Lightweight- Nice bright screen- Good menues, customizable- Touch screen is pretty responsive- Comes with stylus pen (you'll need it for text messages)- Features acelerometer- Good volume and quality MP3 player- Bluetooth- Navigation runs pretty fast- Battery life is goodCons:- Manual could be better, misses some useful information- Photo Camera is not very good (don't be fooled by the 3MP)- Some basic things are complicated to configure (like ringtones)- LG propietary connection for headphonesThe camera quality is far from stellar, but you can't ask a cellphone to take great photos, specially at this price point.I've owned another LG phone (MG 280) and it turned out to be the worse I had, I even promised myself i would never buy another LG, but clearly after seeing this one you can tell these guys evolved a lot and listened to their customers on many common issues with their previous phones.All in all, the best $190 you can spend on a phone today, sure there are better, but none of them below this price. If you want something good and don't want so spend too much, this is by far the best option you've got.

I wasn't eligible for an upgrade for about 8-9 months (plus I don't really know if I want to be with them for another 2 years). So I figured my only two options were to purchase a phone from an ATT store for the full, unsubsidized price or buy an unlocked phone. Buying an unlocked phone definitely makes much more sense. For about the same price, you can get a phone without carrier restrictions, and should you decide to use another carrier, you can just put a different SIM card in the phone (for GSM phones). Anyway this particular phone is OK. I wanted to get another Sony Ericsson, but they are too overpriced for what the phones can do. LG is another good brand so I looked into this one. It's a good price, a nice budget phone that still has decent features. As far as looks, I loved it; sleek, thin, and black. That's about where it ended for me though. I didn't much care for the menu layouts, and the touchscreen is extremely slow and lagging. Texting was a nightmare for me with the touchscreen keyboard as I would always hit the wrong button or hit a button twice because the screen would lag. The camera is also terrible. The 2MP on both my Sony Ericsson and now my Nokia are exponentially better than this camera. The video player also sucks. I only kept this phone for about a week, so I don't really remember everything. I just feel like you can get better for your money.

I still like my Palm Treo for what it can do but sad to say it needs to retire. I was going to order the same item (Palm Treo 680) but decided to try and go with a touch screen. The LG KP500 Cookie unlocked cellphone is in excellent condition. I inserted the sim card and took it for a test drive. The touch screen is very responsive, colors are vivid and true to life. No complaints about this item.

I haven't seen a user's manual, so I don't know how to use all the features yet.  The camera takes decent photos outside.  I'm not returning it, but I also don't love it.  The qwerty touch-screen keyboard is hard to use because the letters are so tiny and I'm always hitting the wrong letter.  I end up just using the regular phone number pad to write text messages.  Even when the \"auto key lock\" is turned off, for some reason the phone always locks when I'm using it; this means that in order to do anything interactive like pushing 7 to delete a message or answer an incoming call or whatever, I first have to unlock the phone.  Then I have to push something to get the appropriate touch screen to come up, and sometimes I don't push the right thing the first time and I do something I didn't mean to do.  I rejected a call from my grandma, for instance.  Unlike my previous phones, this one goes completely blank after about 3 seconds to save power.  Probably I could change this setting somehow, but I don't know how.  The issue is that it can't conveniently be used as a clock because you always have to turn it on in order to see the time.  You also have to always turn it on to see if you have any missed calls or messages, so you either are paranoidly turning it on all the time or else missing messages.  These difficulties probably speak to my technological abilities rather than the phone itself; though I'm not generally inept when it comes to new technology (BTW, I'm 36, not 86).  I think I prefer real buttons to the touch screen.  Oh--and the charger I received didn't work.  So I charge the phone by connecting it to my computer via the USB cable.  One thing I do love is the FM radio.  It's been so long since I listened to radio!  I pulled in and programmed a lot of stations.

No issues with the touch screen as others have pointed out. The cell phone itself is very light weight and slim as compared to other phones having similar specs. It has been over a week now and I am very pleased with the performance of this phone.PROS :- Lightweight and slim- Touchscreen works absolutely fine.- Speaker volume is sufficient.- International support (using it in Asia..)CONS :- Camera could have been better.- Not recommended for messaging.I have previously owned a Samsung phone which had a 1.3 MP camera and the results were 5 times better than the 3.2 MP camera of this LG KP500 phone. I guess you get what you pay for. But above all this is a great touch screen phone for a price around $100 that I bet you cannot beat.

Considering the limited number of prepaid phones T-mobile offers, this is quite the deal. Although it is an international version, mostly sold in UK I believe, and the fact that the manual is in another language, I give this phone a high rating. The touch screen is fantastic, the camera is okay, the music playing system is great, the additional stylus pen (I don't really use it)is okay, and the opportunity to expand memory is unbeatable. The downside is that you can't really use the web or set up an e-mail (no wi=fi), and the phone is a bit slow loading your entire music/pictures, and multitasking is nearly impossible. Regardless, if you want a stylish phone that performs fundamental functions and you have AT&T; or T-mobile and want an inexpensive phone, I highly recommend this phone!", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG KP500 Cookie Unlocked Phone (Black)--International Version with No Warranty", "Author": "G.

(I have one and it works flawlessly)But when scrolling thru my contact list, the touch screen would be hyper sensitive and select contacts that just happened to be under the thumb while pushing the list to scroll up.This makes searching for contacts very annoying and is not helpful at all when looking for a number in a hurry and dialing it.Also the Widgets for speed dial sometimes don't work, and are not responsive, not sure why.The other drawback for me is that after listening to a voice mail, there is no number pad available to save or delete it.

The 3.2 megapixel camera is great for taking pictures, and it has many of the standard features of any phone, and including a touchscreen and included stylus. My favorite part of the phone however, is the built-in FM radio for an unlimited supply of music(a handset comes included). The games included are also pretty good and it comes with two home screens, one for normal gadgets (organizer, clock, sticky notes,etc) and another for quick access to certain contacts.Now the bad...the only thing that stopped me from giving this small and stylish phone any more stars is the sluggish touch screen. It isn't well calibrated and sometimes takes a few moments to get from page to page. Note that I'm not even talking about using this device on the internet.Overall, this phone isn't bad. It's a slightly over average phone, with a few useful tools.

Si te registras en la pagina de LGMOBILE, puedes bajar bastantes juegos. Como recomendacion, si vas a registrarte hazlo como si estuvieras en espa\u00f1a de lo contrario no vas a encontar informacion ni aplicaciones.

El envio de mensajes, es un tanto dificil, si estas acostumbrado a enviar mensajes SMS constantemente y de manera rapida, este modelo no es para ti, es un poco complejo. inclusive con el teclado QWERTY.2. No guarda registro de ultimos numeros a los que le has enviado mensajes, por lo cual a la hora de buscar el destinatario te lleva mucho tiempo.3. Si tienes muchos contactos se dificulta a busqueda.3. No tiene funcionalidad de copy paste.4. La camara no tiene auto focus, es casi imposible tomar una foto clara.5. No tiene Flash6.

Los audifonos no son de muy buena calidad, es plastico duro, por lo que es incomodo en los oidos y muy propenso a quebrarse.8.

Not only did the phone not work with my network like the seller said it would, but the day after I received it in the mail it stopped working. It would not connect to the internet and it wouldn't allow me to make any outgoing calls. You might be saying; \"Well, why didn't you return it for a refund?\" I tried! I spent 11 days with that stupid package by the door waiting for ups to come pick it up like the return policy said to do. And when ups didn't show i decided to try to contact the seller directly. Email. Phone calls. I couldn't get a hold of somebody to save my life.In summary because of this purchase i will never again order anything from this seller. Also, i purchased a phone through amazons competitor eBay, and i received the phone in 4 days without hassle.
