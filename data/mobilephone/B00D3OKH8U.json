I'd rather have purple, but white is better than the boring basic black. I wish I could change some colors on my calendar & text message screen, but overall after you learn how to use it's easy!!! So glad BB came out with a 4G that had the key board. Just what I've been waiting for!", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love my Q10 - not your typical giant smartphone", "Author": "Ali", "ReviewID": "R20CJRI8G25EMC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone. I love the keyboard and the screen is plenty big. It's not meant for a basic computer illetrate person like the iPhone which seems like a kids toy to me. This is an adult phone which has all the features I need in a phone. I love the size and the sturdy feel. It doesnt feel cheap or like it will break. The os is great and everything is lightning fast. Highly recommended.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Efficient, fun and excellent camera", "Author": "a nice person in MI", "ReviewID": "R3QR659POAYKFM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone a couple months now and absolutely love it.  The battery life is very good, and the camera is AMAZING.  The screen is big enough to enjoy the graphics, and a keyboard is a must for me.  It took about 2 days to get used to the keys, which in fact are the most ergonomic I've ever had in several other brands.  The OS is solid, network very fast.  I do appreciate the hub that Blackberry added; thought I think it makes me more addicted to this phone :-)  Personally, I have all the apps I want on it, I guess it's a matter of preference.  The phone also has a nice, solid feel and is just the right size.  I hope Blackberry sticks around because I've finally found a phone just perfect for me.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Q10 worth the risk!", "Author": "Bill H", "ReviewID": "R1FFYGDINB2M5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I know there is a lot of apprehension to buy Blackberry product right now. I went with it for the keyboard, but the operation of everything else is faster and smoother than I would have expected. The keyboard is great, better spacing than the Bold. Touch screen is fun to work with the tiles are very helpful for jumping between programs/webpages. Great feel to the phone as well.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic phone !!!", "Author": "S. Suwandi \"Sue99\"", "ReviewID": "R27AQJMZJTF5R7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Q10 is a huge and bestest upgrade of Blackberry, BUT only if users care more about solid quality of  technology, NOT contents, which actually will be catching up real soon. Smooth navigation between apps, a hub to link all your mailbox and notices (Linkedin, FB, Foursquare, Skype)  and texts is super awesome.. Camera and time shift technique are super cool.. Phone line is magically so so clear and crisp.. Using this really makes you feel  having the best tool to use your time efficiently in the best way.. Other phones need couple more steps and Q10 only needs two three sweeps to get the same things done (you need time to understand the flows but it's definitely not a rocket science at all).. No single crash, battery lasts the longest other phones would hardly beat.. Since iPhone era, consumer got so spoilt with contents, but rarely noticed the technology which actually should be a single main reason to upgrade a phone.. You can get contents, gaming, browsing, drawing, reading, watching video through a tablet.  It's silly to use a phone as a multi task entertainment hub, the phone size is never ever made to do justice.  This is ti.. The white color is as beautiful and classy  as Samsung but a smaller size to feel a good grip in one hand. I've been having Q10 for about a month. Try it, really !", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Smidgen", "ReviewID": "R1JRW09E22RLJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this phone.

I hated my droid x2 and wanted a physical keyboard. The q10 had good reviews and is a great phone, but the lack of apps has gotten really old.

It is so different from my previous phone.  My main problem is the physical handling of it--it is so slippery and easily dropped.

This phone is so easy to use for a smartphone and size is perfect. Keyboard is a breeze to type and if I can't type, talking to it makes it simple, too. There are limited apps but I use this phone for business so I don't need much other apps besides the office apps and those are perfect to this phone.
