The camera is excellent and takes photos and videos that are both sharp and vibrant in colour. The battery life is average but I managed to greatly improve it by installing an app and ensuring that wifi and mobile data were off when not being used.It came unlocked as the seller specified and with Android 2.3 installed. I had some trouble updating to Android 4.0.4 using the Samsung software (Kies) but eventually found another official tool that completed the update.

It was fine at first, but now my phone will be fully charged at 8 AM, and by 4 PM it will be at 15% life.If you order this phone, please, check the battery first for the date on it and save yourself some trouble, as some sellers put a cheaper stock battery in. I ordered a new battery because of this, so hopefully this solves the problem.The external keyboard is a great feature, but quite frankly, is something that I never use, which I thought I would but the touch screen keyboard is more convenient to me.Pros:Simple to useSmallerDoes everything you would expect a smartphone to do(granted, it is an older phone, but I haven't encountered anything that I wish I had that hardware does not support, it can do anything)Great starter smartphone, especially for the cheaper priceCons:Watch the battery problem and just buy a brand new one and switch between the twoCall quality can be bad at times, but this is more due to bad reception, in most cases.Bulkier, but that is because of the external keyboard more than anything.Would I recommend to anyone: Absolutely", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Second Try, but Great!", "Author": "RM123", "ReviewID": "R2GB9JOTY2FQWT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So, originally I bought this phone and it arrived unlocked, everything I wanted, BUT it would not charge unless the charger was at an insane angle.

I've since updated the OS to  ICS (4.0.4) with little to no problems. a lot of people complain about the qwerty hardware being too flat -and the keys ARE flush-, but with all the space and after the experience with the LG Expo, using the keyboard on this is cake. In fact because of the size of the phone itself -not too small nor too big- and the responsiveness of the touchscreen i use the qwerty hardware much less that i did with the LG. i wish i had changed my phone faster; i think may have become an Android fan now.If you're looking for a low-cost, android smartphone with qwerty hardware, this is it.EDIT:So it's been a little over a month now since I had this phones and I've noticed that the one flaw that I have found in it is that just about every other call I make or receive is dropped. Making or receiving a call is extremely difficult especially if you're inside a building, or just inside a car. I usually only use my phone for when I really, really, need to contact someone and it's really frustrating when you're on a really important phone call and that call is dropped, or the person on the other end cannot hear you, but you can hear them clear as day.

I love the look and feel of the phone. I have dropped it several times and it has not scratched or broken in anyway (though I do have a case).

This basically means some features won't work, for example I have unlimited data but since the phone is AT&T; I need \"permission\" to use tethering or hotspots (which kind of sucks, I have unlimited data for a reason, you know).

No problems. No complaints ... except.  Except I am getting more into the texting side of phoning since that is all my adult kids will pay attention to. I thought about getting an old phone with a QWERTY keyboard but also thought maybe I should make the jump to a more modern smart phone type. Since I like the Samsung brand and am an AT&T; GoPhone account holder, the Captivate Glide SGH-i927 looked like a big leap forward ... for me ... and nice size QWERTY keyboard.  I really didn't need any more bells or whistles but was willing to have them in case I might want to start getting smarter with my smart phone.Bad idea. I found the phone apps and multiple layers of pages less than intuitive.  I discovered that I couldn't transfer my old phone contacts to the i927 using the USB cable.  So that meant days if not weeks of keyboard entry one by one. I discovered, as some reviewers have noted, that the slide out keyboard, while relatively large, is fairly flat and is difficult to hit the correct keys.  The keyboard was also inconsistent in the amount of pressure needed to make a key register. This inconsistent pressure sensitivity was also a problem on the touch screen. I missed several calls because my tap to pick up the call did not register.The last straw was when the display screen would dim for no apparent reason (I reset the dim time to one minute) while I was working/touching the screen. This random screen dimming/flickering was not only annoying but distracting.  I never knew if my screen action was executed or not.Enough was enough.  I sent it back before the 30 days trial was up. Amazon made the return process so quick and painless that I don't think I would ever purchase online from any other vendor.  I haven't received my refund yet but I have every confidence that Amazon will come through.

I am comparing it to phones in the $150.00 price range. I looked at hundreds of phones, literally, before I got this one. I needed a unlocked GSM phone, and I did not want to pay more than 200 bucks for it. I dropped my last one and broke the screen after a year, so I don't think it is worth paying $500 or more for a phone.The Good:The phone itself is pretty great. The screen has a beautiful (Super Amoled) display. The performance is also very good. Apps run well and I have not had any crashing or shut down issues. I really did not care about the qwerty keyboard, but despite the fact that it has one, the phone is very thin and light. The keyboard stays locked in and you would not even know it is there. I like a aftermarket keyboard app called swiftkey, because it predicts what word you will type next and it saves you a ton of typing. I put that on this phone and I use it more than the qwerty one. The hardware keyboard does come in very handy for some apps, like the Wells Fargo app, because the on screen keyboard covers to much of the screen. So I use the qwerty keyboard when it makes sense, best of both worlds. This phone has more on board memory than any phone I have ever had. I am a software junky so I like a lot of apps. I have over 40 apps on here and I'm only using about half of the space so far. I did put a 16 GB SD card in and of course I move all the apps that are able to the card. Still, every app that you move to the SD card leaves something on the device, and some apps can't be moved at all. I have a android 7\" tablet and with 40 apps on it you run out of space. I will probably never need to worry about free space on this phone, for the first time in my life, which is nice.The Bad:The battery. Battery  life is not all that great, worst than any android device that I have owned. When I did research on this phone I noticed that it was released almost two years ago, so it was sitting on a shelf for a couple of years and the battery could be a bit stale. This will not be a problem, really, since there are many replacement battery options out there. I have found batteries ranged in price from $11 to $30 for this phone. I put an app called \"Advanced Task Manager\" on here and it helps a lot. This app kills all of the processes when the screen shuts down automatically. The camera is good (8 MP), but I was expecting a little better. My old phone had a 5 MP camera, and I really don't think this camera is better. I have had a problem with this camera depositing a check with the Wells Fargo app. My old phone would do it without fail. I tried at least 20 times with this one, and it could not focus properly. I ended up driving 16 miles to the bank. The pictures that I have taken, quite a few, turned out pretty good though. My old 5 MP camera (smartphone) took good pictures as well. A lot of the phones that I looked at in this price range had only 3 MP cameras, so the 8 MP one on this phone was a big factor toward getting this one. The problem with the Wells Fargo app could be the fault of the app. I will try it again when I want to deposit a check, and I will make sure the lighting is better.Bottom line:This is a great phone for the money. It has plenty of internal storage space and seems to perform well no matter what I throw at it. The qwerty keyboard is nice to have, and it does not bulk the phone up or weigh it down. The camera takes good pictures, even though I wish it was even better. The battery life is horrid, about eight hours on stand by, before I put the \"Advanced Task Manager\" app in. The battery now lasts 12 - 15 hours on standby with the task killer installed. That's just with the phone in your pocket. The battery can be replaced with a fresh one, or even a extended capacity one, so its not a deal breaker.

As occasionally happens there, I got an uncommunicative seller who shipped in very very poor packaging ending with me with a loose phone/battery and box in another box but the phone appear(s)ed to be working okay.I bought this phone as a locked AT&T; phone but had already done my homework/pricing to unlock it. As I use Consumer Cellular it did not really need to be unlocked to work with their network but I went ahead and purchased an unlock code and did it myself successfully. Please note unlocking is not the same as rooting. How I wish I could root this phone! It is not easy to do, and I even paid some folks for fixes and got my money back after they failed. So, unlock can be done. I have done it. Rooting is very difficult and should only be attempted by professional in the field.  I did need consumer cellular help to get it to hook up with their APN so I could get data. Took a few calls but I am OK.  Would hate to think what just another brand unlocked phone would be like to get going since technically, CC uses AT&T; it should not have been this difficult.I bought this to wean off of a Blackberry. I had tried some waawee huawei whatever smartphone and hated the onscreen keyboard with a passion and the fact it was a little piece of junk.  I didn't have much faith in RIM and BB continuing but still wanted a physical keyboard so this fit the bill.  I agree that while the pull out keyboard is nice, it is not really that easy to type on.  Gradually over the year I have been using the onscreen misery more just because that has the autocorrect. It is a nice option to have a real keyboard so enjoy while you can.Besides the issue with getting this phone to accept another APN (even though it was unlocked) the Samsung issues are as follows:1) Yes the battery life sucks.  Sometimes if I come home and forget to hook it to power for overnight it is dead dead dead in the morning.  Just resign yourself to giving it a good charge at the minimum once a day/night.2) GPS flaw.  Two issues there actually.  One is the darn thing won't lock and will just drain your battery when you turn it on for an app that requires it. It requires a reboot for the GPS to lock if the phone has not been rebooted in a day or two. Second is it is so bad it can just overheat/shutdown the phone even if it did lock.3) External memory micro SD problem. This is reportedly an issue with a) all androids or b) all samsungs or c) counterfeit cards. Pick one.  I replaced the teeny 2GB that came with my Glide with a Kingston 32GB class 4 card. I had issues with the apps that were moved to SD disappearing but nothing a reboot or reinstall of app would not fix until yesterday when the phone got hot as the surface of the sun and gave me the dire message of damaged SD card after I rebooted to get the GPS working (yes, do not depend on this phone in a pinch, please don't).The card is dead as in doornail not recognized by this or any device or able to hold formatting. Getting warranty replacement on the card but beware if you want to upgrade.  I have no advice after reading so many conflicting accounts about just what is the problem with Android or Samsung and external cards. Apparently these days it is no longer common to even have capability for an external card on a droid so leads me to believe it is an OS thing.As a phone.  Call quality is less than stellar if you ask me.  But I am mostly in marginal areas and have not had an issue in fantastic signal areas.Data - accept that in good signal areas with hyperband whathave you when it will forget it is unlocked it seems to be fine.  If it forgets it is unlocked in some special AT&T; service area it requires turning data on/off again to do the other APN thing again.Camera - very nice.  Haven't used the front much, I don't want to see me any more than anybody else would want to.You can see here this phone has required me to do more technical stuff than I care to. It is nice to have a keyboard, camera is very good and it has not dropped dead on me so giving it four stars rather than three.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for the Price!", "Author": "DENINE THRASHER", "ReviewID": "R1ZDVY71DN73G7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this phone.

I was extremely happy with it for the first two months too.Problem number 1:  The first random issue I started having with my phone is that I would not receive phone calls. Not only would I not receive the phone calls, but I would not get a missed call notification...and sometimes if the person left me a message, I wouldn't even get that for hours.  Not good when my kids are at school and this is my only mode of communication.  I don't know how long this went on, but I discovered it when my dad showed up unexpectedly to my house.  He NEVER shows up unexpectedly.  He ALWAYS, ALWAYS calls.  He may be pulling up to my house, but he will call before knocking on the door.  lol.  He called me several times before arriving, but my phone (which I had on my hip) never rang.  He even called me in my foyer with me standing right next to him.  Nothing.  This is a periodic on-going issue.  I also experience a delay in receiving texts.  All the time.  I won't get a text all day long and then will step into a certain place in my house, and get bombarded with them all at once.Problem number 2: The brand new storage card came up as not working, or unformatted or something.  I lost all my pictures.  We bought a new one even though the one in the phone was only a couple months old and it has happened one more time since then.  Sometimes I can just reset the phone by taking the battery, SIM and storage out for a few minutes, but if I have a case on my phone, this is a real pain in the butt to be doing on a regular basis.Problem number 3:  No WI-FI even though everything else in my house is picking it up just fine.  This also was fixed by taking all the guts out of my phone (and considering smashing them to pieces) for several minutes.Problem number 4:  Just randomly rebooting.  In the middle of a text.  In the middle of a call.  In the middle of everything.  The screen goes blank, then flashes....and then it reboots.  This is one of my favorite problems because I have no life, but whenever I need to be available (like I am waiting for a ride to my son's class trip), it will just randomly shut off and turn back on...go through the 5 minute start-up process....Problem number 5:  I believe this is the last problem but I will gladly come back when I discover more.  I'm sure there will be more.  THE PHONE WON'T CHARGE!  This one almost caused a divorce.  lol.  not really, but...  I told my husband that my phone was not charging with my charger.  I tried different outlets thinking maybe it was not making a good connection, etc.  He tried the same crap I tried (thus the potential for divorce. If you are married, you know what I mean)and went online to research.  Lo and behold!  Other people are having issues with the phones not charging!  SHOCKER! To the point that others have gone out and purchased new batteries AND a charger, and they just switch out the batteries.  Again really annoying when you try to have a case on your phone.  SO FAR, the phone will not charge with the charger it came with, but I can charge it with my husband's motorola charger....and he uses my charger to charge his phone.  SO WE KNOW IT ISN'T THE CHARGER!Every single one of these problems is an on-going problem.  None of them were one-time freak happenings.  I am dealing with most of these (the late texts, the wi-fi not loading, the not receiving phone calls or messages...the rebooting, the charger not working) EVERY SINGLE DAY.  This is so unacceptable in this day of smart phone technology!We purchased this phone at some point in November.  It is now June.  Seven months into a two year contract.  This phone issue has caused us to seriously consider our cell phone options, and we are probably going to go cheap pre-paid when this contract is up.  Unfortunately, this is our first foray into smart phone territory.  We are not fans.  I am disgusted with Samsung and the shoddy workmanship of this phone.  This is probably the only phone I have owned that I HAVEN'T dropped yet...and it is by far the only phone I have had this many issues with...and it can't even be blamed on the phone being a dinosaur!
