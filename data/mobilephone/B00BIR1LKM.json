I bought 2. 1 for my mom and another a friend. Windows Phone 8 OS is better customizable then Apple's iOS, but still simple to navigate, but less complex then Android. Windows office in your hands. Free Nokia high quality apps: Here navigation (off line maps, download a map and you don't need data roaming!), Here City lens, Here transport, Nokia Music! and many more. 145K apps high quality apps in the WP8 app store. That is enough to do anything you need with your phone. iOS and Android have more 600K apps, but the majority of apps are doing the same thing ... like 10 different flash lights, 10 different fart apps ...", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Speaker not working on two phones", "Author": "Colin911", "ReviewID": "R111IWDAEVFYT7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Have bought this item twice from the same seller.  First the item came in chineese so had to figure out how to change the language.  Then the speaker did no work so the phone did not ring when someone called.  Sent that phone back and ordered a new one.  Same deal with the chineese language when i got it, but this time the speaker worked - for a week or so then stopped working.  Going to go with a whole new phone from another supplier.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BIR1LKM"}}
