{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good affordable phone", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "RJK1AERE44REP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone as a back up phone and a phone to leave at the house since I do not have a landline so I do not use it as my main phone so I have not talked for hours on it, but I have made a few short calls on it and it works fine. Voice quality is great and clear. Has several ring tone selections you can chose from allso the battery can last me almost an entire week on stand by, If I make a few calls it last usually 4 to 5 days.The issue people in other reviews keep complaining about such as the phone dialing on its own all you have to do is lock the keypad. Very simple. You can set it up in the menu to auto lock on its own so many minutes after a keypress, or you can lock it yourself by holding down the button in the lowest left corner (the * button) the button also has a little lock icon on it. This prevents the phone from accidentally dialing  As far as people saying the phone connects to the internet easily, I dont see how. The Send and End keys are very large, you push the button portion of the button for send and end the top portion is the select buttons for things on the screen (such as Internet) I have large man thumbs and have yet to once accidentally connect to the internet all you have to do to avoid it is push the bottom portion of the button right where it says Pwr/End. Not that hard people!I recieved the phone in the tracfone packaging/box. It came with a wall charger and car charger and it had juice already in the battery when I powered on the phone. All I had to do was activate the phone by entering in the numbers from the sticker on the box on Tracfone's site, after I did that the phone was instantly registered and topped up with 30 free minutes to go with too!I did have to look in the menu to find the phones number as it didnt show me a number when I activated it as I assumed it had only activated the phone itself I didnt even realize the phone came with free 30mins until the phone beeped and showed a notifications saying the minutes were added and days added for service. Also with this phone all minutes automatically double when you add them. I added more minutes the following day after activation and it was very simple, just went to Tracfone's site entered in the phone number and chose a bucket of minutes and paid via credit card and about 10seconds after hitting submit, the minutes were on my phone doubled and ready to go. Very easy.With Tracfones if the model number ends in G, its a GSM phone that runs on AT&T; and Tmobile if it ends with C, its a CDMA phone that runs on Sprint and Verizon. This phone runs on AT&T; and Tmobile and where I am at the coverage is flawless. I always have full bars and have not experienced any dropped calls or issues. One complaint that I do have with Tracfone is their ringtones and background pics that you can buy on the phone, they are enormously inflated way more than what I have seen anywhere else including other prepay services. $6 for a background photo  and $4 for a ringtone is a bit much Tracfone!Other than that its a great phone!", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "Kara", "ReviewID": "R7C9BGRFK2CAC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this phone didnt have any thrills but it was as reliable as a tank. only prob was that it calls sos really easy. i butdialed jackson,green,canton, akron police just with this phone. even when you put it on lock screen it does it. so unless you want to spend alot of time on the phone with law enforcement officers this isnt the phone for you", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cheap phone, steals minutes", "Author": "Myself", "ReviewID": "R215LGVFUQUGCI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Texting and web browsing can't be disabled.
