It arrived lightening fast and It is everything I was hoping for and more. The screen is amazing. Everything works..GPS included. The phone is fast and I couldnt be happier. I ordered the Cimo clear case international version for Samsung S3 and it fits great. I had to cut a bit of a larger opening for the volume rocker but it works like a charm. The price and product, compared to a new S3 unlocked is WORTHIT!I am so happy with this phone I just ordered another for my daughter.I use straight talk and ordered a Bring Your Own Phone SIM card (ATT compatible) changed the settings for the APN and it works great.The camera has a flash...a bunch of different settings, zoom, panaramic..So far the only change I made was to add a different messenging program because something I did when I imported my old sim card phone numbers caused the stock messenging program to have difficulty with the number format. I believe it was user error and not the phone. Handscent SMS works great.I used my old SIM to do a contacts import before installing the BYOP SIM from straight talk. Order a standard SIM for this phoneThe old straight talk sim works but you will not have a data connection. So if you already have straight talk you will still have to order a Bring Your Own Phone SIM. I emailed straight talk and they confirmed that.My battery is at 56% right now....after 6 hours of use...I haven't decided on the rating for battery life just yet. I had a Nokia Smartphone prior and the battery was amazing. This phone uses a standard Android charger so those are easy to find and you get two batteries with your purchase.5 stars for ME!I bought mine from LOlbuy...Daniel Chen was great!One more thing...I downloaded the user manual for the S3 on the tmobile website. It is essentially the manual for this phone minus some of the preloaded Tmobile apps. Its a great reference for things like tethering and GPS.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "GauloisUSA", "ReviewID": "R1QQ2LKVVGY4K8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took the phone a bit more than a week to come from Singapore via air USPS, there was no tracking information except for the departure date/time from Singapore.After opening the case, I found the telephone, USB cord, power plug, 2 batteries, manual in English, headphones, one screen protector AND an extra back cover with attached front cover AND a touch pen.Now, the sticker on the phone says \"HD AMOLED\" screen, which I doubt it is. Not for that price. So, the battery should not last as long as with a phone with an LED screen. Also, the front sticker says Quad Core CPU. That is not, it is the MT6577 Dual Core processor.But after playing with it, it is awesome. Android 4.1 is great,  the CPU is quick. It comes with a pre-installed 2gb SD card, but when removing the SD card, you have to look closely at the direction which to slide its support. After installing the SIM card, I was able to have my call list and make calls. Sound through calls and reception were clear. I have better reception (4 bars) at home with it than my Samsung Rugby 2 flip phone (3 bars).I had my data plan blocked a while back on my flip phone, I will see if my carrier catches on with my new phone and slap me with a data plan, which I don't want nor need.The single speaker from the phone's back is clean and can be loud. You will need to access the equalizer from the music widget to set it up to your liking.The GPS is right on the spot, but to see your location, the map has to be downloaded. Looking at it through WiFi won't show you your location.The camera is fine, picture quality is fair. The flash must have been updated from what others have been saying, as I think it's pretty good for it's purpose. Front camera is fine too.The headphone is lousy but has a microphone on it so you can use it for hands free calls.On the keyboard, some keys wills still be in Chinese, I don't know if they can be changed, but you will figure out quickly what they are for.Over all, very sturdy and solid phone. Great for the money. If it wasn't an S3 clone, it could stand on its own and be competitive against the big boys.update 1/6/2013:For the case, I have tried one S3 case, but my phone is a bit too thick for it. When I remove the back plate from the phone, it will fit nicely in the case, but do I want to do that? maybe not. Then I will have to cut an access for the sound rocker and the 3.5mm jack which are in different locations compare to the S3. Still, unbeatable phone for the money.Update 1/21/2013: Still solid and working strong. Battery last 2 to 3 days without playing with apps. One full day if having lots of fun. I discovered from an other post that if you go to \"Settings\" then \"About phone\" then tap very fast (7 times)on \"Android version 4.1.1\", it will show \"Android 4.0 ICS\". But there are no important difference between 4.0 and 4.1 anyway. So I recap the lies : Not quad core, Not Android 4.1, Not NFC, not HD AMOLED, Not 8MP camera. But if you don't mind all that, it's still a great bargain.Update 3/17/2013: Like the bunny, it keeps on going and going and..... I had an issue with \"Als_ps calibration\" under \"display\". DO NOT MESS with this calibration. My phone was out of calibration and had to email customer service for help. Beside their broken English, they were extremely helpful and helped me into the calibration process. 5 more stars for support.Update 4/15/2013: Still working fine. Just got a dock/charging station for it. Our phone fits perfect.It includes spare battery charging as well. But our battery does not fit the space. So get the one without the spare battery charger.http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B008Q24UNM/ref=cm_cmu_up_thanks_hdrB008CANRGEUpdate 8/04/2013: And still working fine. But I can see small specks of dust behind the screen. I thought at first it was behind my screen protector, but when I removed it, I could seen the dust behind the phone screen. So I opened the phone and vacuumed it. That didn't work. Well, the good news is that those particles are only visible on black screen, when the phone is off. Those very few and little particles do not affect the phone workability.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I WAS Skeptical... and I WAS RIGHT", "Author": "joseph aorahim", "ReviewID": "RSGVVTS61D0YL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "WHAT I THINK NOW (APRIL 10, 2012):Hey guys, been meaning to update this post a few months ago!! First off, I want to say that my first impression of the phone WAS awesome. Now I will urge you NOT to buy it and take your money elsewhere.Within days of using the phone, my screen cracked horizontally across the screen. I thought to myself, no biggie, still works. Within a couple of weeks, the phone corrupted my SD card, I thought it was my SD card because it had been with me for so long, so I reformatted the SD card and again the phone corrupted it. I LOST EVERYTHING, but luckily I had backed up my pictures. Within 2 months, the phone stopped working! I woke up one day, and there was a black background with a picture of a charger, I pulled the battery out and swapped it with the second one... NOTHING. The phone had been telling me that there was a overcurrent, but I was using the cable and adapter that came with the phone. I tried to revive it, but after about 30 minutes I snapped it in half and it FELT SO GREAT, SUCH A WEIGHT had been lifted off my shoulders.The only thing that will say that I enjoyed about the phone was that it was DUAL SIM!!! THATS IT. The phone was causing me nothing but problems. I have purchased a new Google Nexus 4 and have been using it for about 2 weeks now, and feel great. I did have to fork over about 400 dollars but you can find it on Google Play for 299 and 350 for the 8gb and 16gb versions. The only drawback for this phone is that it is a single sim card, but i'm okay with that.WHAT I THOUGHT BEFORE:I just want to start off by saying that I was skeptical about buying this phone from China. A few guys I work with said that I shouldn't have bought it, but I decided to take a chance on this. I'm currently in Afghanistan and needed a phone with dual sim capability, flash, bluetooth, and to be able to listen to music. For me, this phone is perfect because it does all that and then some.PRO'S-The phone is HUGE. I wasn't expecting the screen to be that large, but its very nice. The screen is also very responsive and the quality is awesome.The built in speaker on this phone is loud, but you start to lose some quality the higher you raise the volume.The phone feels well built and solid.The WiFi works great, sent some SMS's and made a few calls, but the service in Afghanistan is horrible to can't really comment on that.It came with two batteries, i was thought i was going to have to carry both batteries on me at all times because they would die out quickly. I can go a whole day with calling and texting, the battery dies a bit quicker when your using WiFi and some other apps, but it does much better than my EVO.The phone is fast and the software is smooth.CON'S:The camera is decent, which I don't mind, but it's very sensitive to shake and sometimes when I'm trying to take a picture, it will lose focus from my hands moving. If you hold very still it will work flawlessly.Some Issues I had when i had the phone include:The phone kept turning off while it was in my pocket. I contacted the seller and explained the situation to him and was told to place a thin piece of paper to hold the battery a bit more snugly. When I did this, I changed to the other battery so I'm not sure if 1 of the 2 batteries i received was bad, or it was the piece of paper trick. But it's been working just fine the last few days.The second issue i had was that when I would make a call, the phones screen would start to go on/off repeatedly. It only happened when i was making a call, so i thought it was the sensor by the ear piece. I had a screen protector that came with the phone that covered everything on the front of the phone, so i removed the portion of the screen protector that was covering the sensor and it started working just fine. So i definitely recommend cutting the screen protector to just cover the screen itself.But now the phone has been working flawlessly the last few days, and i spent most of today downloading apps, cant be anymore happier. I hope this phone can last out here in the conditions in Afghanistan, but will definitely keep you guys updated.As far as what came with the phone; it came with (1) Mini USB to USB cable, (1) Adapter Charger, (1) Screen Protector, (1) Case for the Phone, (2) Batteries, (1) Manual, and the phone itself.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good So Far", "Author": "Thomas M. Taylor \"runman\"", "ReviewID": "RZKFFTFCPWD8C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just received the phone, so this review is just my initial impression.The phone has a pretty solid build as compared to other Samsung cell phones.  The back of the phone appears to be slightly thicker than the S3.  The screen is bright, with good colors and contrast.If you notice in the description, there is no brand of the phone mentioned.  Some of the reviews are mentioning that they received a case with their phone.  This is not the case in my situation.  I received the phone, USB cord and charger, two batteries, and ear buds.I places my AT&T; SIM in the phone and the phone started to work immediately for voice and text.  I do not have a data plan so I cannot tell you rather data is working or how fast the speed is.  WIFI works well with a good signal.  The GPS is very slow to locate satellites and lock a position.  The best GPS location signal I got was within 44 feet, while my galaxy note had me within 10 feet.Finding a wt to change ring tones was interesting.  It is not listed under sounds.  It is in a non descriptive area in settings, and then I had to press a general button and it brought up what I needed.  This is not like normal android devices that I have used in the past.I did purchase a case for this phone.  It is a generic soft-case that has needed to be \"customized\" by myself to get it to fit, mainly the volume button ad to be cut into it.  The case was less than 2 dollars here on amazon, it was not a \"prime\" item, but had free shipping with it.Speaker clarity was clear when I made a few test phone calls, but the other person said that is was likei had them on speaker phone and that I was loud during the call.After reading some reviews, it appears that most people are happy with the initial quality only to be disappointed later.  I will update my review if the quality of the phone starts to decline.7/2/2013 updateHad phone for a week now.  No complaints yet.  There are many makers of this phone.  I noticed that the ad on Amazon does not mention who made the phone, but only lists the specs.  That may be why there is a difference in accessories that come with the phone and the quality.8/3/2013 updateStill not problems noted.  Phone is working fine.  Sometimes the battery will last a couple days, sometimes not.  But other than that, no problems to report.  I did purchase a gel case for the phone, and the gel case, for the most part is fine.  The buttons do not line up with the holes, but it doesn't effect the button press any.8/11/2013The phone is still working great.Here is the phone case that I use:Aimo Wireless SAMI9300SK014 Soft n Snug Silicone Skin Case for Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300 - Retail Packaging - PurpleSearch for that on AMazon and it'll be there.  The buttons do not exactly line up, but I have had not problems with the case and the phone.Last update  10/6/2014Phone is still doing great no problem with it at all.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, Well Pleased!", "Author": "David Lamar", "ReviewID": "R3QK1C8PVKP6G3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a Galaxy S3 with T-mobile...Awesome phone, but the T-mobile service sucked and the bill was too high, so I returned it after I found this phone online.

Not bad. Wanted to have a no contract dual sim phone that would work here and overseas. The quality of the phone is not bad at all - however, there are some caveats:#1) Pay attention to the product specs: the GSM frequencies will not get you more than 2G (slow) service on T-mobile and Straight Talk in America. So, if you were hoping to do T-Mobile unlimited data and text plan for $30 and just use Talkatone (like I was) - you're out of luck. Don't do it.# 2) AT&T; gets faster than 3G service on this phone GSM frequencies and I am going to try Net10 soon - which shares GSM frequencies with AT&T;, but for only $45 per month on auto pay. When in doubt, call the customer care center of the cell company you want to use and ask about their frequencies. I will update this review in June after I come back from Europe (I have a Vodafone sim in the phone as well). I think that this frequency conflict is a big deal - especially if you want to save money AND have decent data service.#3) I agree with other reviews that the camera is OK and that the GPS is wonky. I have not (as of yet) been able to access GPS when off WiFi. I contacted the seller to see if I can get more specific information on this. However, it stinks if you use your phone as a GPS device and want constant navigation like a Garmin. Also, I haven't gone full out with the camera yet - if you are a non-picture aficionado (like me), I am sure it will be decent. Flash seems a little weak.#4) The Cimo cases (available on Amazon) do fit this phone. With the back cover off, the fit is even better. Had no problems with doing that. However, you have to remove part of the cover to use the audio jack because the holes don't line up there. Big whoop.#4) I was informed by the seller that the Chinese phones use cheap parts here and there (SHOCKER) that explains some of the \"glitches\" and \"issues\" - this was interesting because his implication was that we may all be ordering the same phone per se, but it's being reproduced in different areas all over with different senses of \"quality control\"I hope that this review is helpful and might actually save you some money and time (that I have obviously been wasting experimenting with this phone). Overall, it's not bad, but requires some patience. I hope it saves me (and you) $$ in the long run.I have to take my experience with a grain of salt because I would have never known this or learned more about the carriers and this phone without going through all of this! If you are somewhat patient and want to come out on top with a better deal at the end (for the most part) realizing that things like this usually require a \"trade off\", it's not a bad buy at all.And yes, I get asked if I have a Galaxy 3 all the time.

The phone works fine, but purchasing merchandise from China is very risky.  I got my phone and was able to get it set up with my T-Mobile service just fine.  About 3-4 weeks later, after having used the phone with my service for nearly a month, my phone suddenly had no service.  When I contacted T-Mobile to find out why, I was advised that my phone - which I purchased believing that it was a new phone - appears to have been stolen and had been blocked by the previous owner.  Weize assured me that my phone was brand new, and that they had removed the block.  T-Mobile confirmed in October that the block had been removed, and helped restore service to my phone.  Then on December 2, I again noticed that my T-Mobile service was not working.  I contacted T-Mobile again and was again told that my phone was blocked by the previous owner because it appeared that the phone was stolen.  Weize's only solution at this point was to tell me to return the phone by USPS First Class mail.

The plastic has a flimsy feeling, but it is comparible to most phones that still cost 2-3 times as much off contract. The screen however feels great, with no imperfections in the glass.Everything feels responsive on the phone, the MTK6577 processor manages to hold its own even running fairly demanding 3d games, such as Temple Run 2. It has a normal boot up time, not quite as fast as my old WP7 HTC Titan, but that is just an Android issue, as it is a larger OS with more background processes going on. There is some minor jutter going through menus on the phone occasionally, and the model I bought only had 512mbs of system RAM, which is a little too small for multitasking larger APPs, but some models have been updated to 1gig system RAM.The storage space built into the phone is almost unusably small, but Micro SD cards are cheap and easily available nowadays, so that isn't a huge negative anymore.The main gripe to be had with the phone is the battery life. It comes with 2 batteries supposedly rated at 2500mAh, but I have my doubts that it is honestly that strong (not that 2500mAh is that amazing). Running in standby I can go through a workday without charging, but web surfing or even music playing drains it pretty fast. It does come with 2 batteries so it offsets it to a degree, but if you plan on heavy usage you might want to have a charger handy.Call quality is passable, people on the other end say I sound tingy through the mic, but understandable. The speaker does the job.The back camera is, well, workable. Slow capture speed and horrid low light performance limits what you can do with it (don't even bother with the flash), but it is a league ahead of the front facing camera. Don't expect to do anything with the front camera, be it video calling or self shots. Massive artifacting, even worse low light performance than the main camera, and it is very slow capturing images even in the best of conditions. The capture software does implement fake HDR, but the software doesn't do a good job really. Software HDR is pointless in any phone camera though.Otherwise, the issues I ran into with battery life and RAM were expected going into this purchase, but the fact that it works as well as it does is jaw dropping for me. It performs almost as well as name brand phones (MTK processors have come a long way from when they powered KIRF Ipods) and it has handled day to day use from me for the past week.

It has the Jelly Bean look and feel (new menus and other updated user interface items), the Jelly Bean \"Easter Egg\" in the Phone Information page, and it reports itself as API Level 16. So this one checks out entirely as actually being 4.1.1.That said, I loved the other phone, and decided to buy this one as a birthday present for my adult daughter (who was also impressed with my new phone.) She is loving it.The phone runs apps quickly and responsively. The display size and resolution are fantastic, it's sharp, clear, colorful, and huge without being too big for a hand or a pocket. The display is responsive, with 5-point touchGeneral notes on the phone: It takes full size SIM cards (it has two slots), will run without a SIM card (though not make calls) so it makes a good Android developer phone, too. It has the specs claimed in the product listing, though the GPS takes a minute or more to get a fix, and requires a clear sky to do so with the two phones we've got. No indoors satellite connections for us.The outline of the phone does not exactly match a Samsung SIII, so you can't use Samsung hard cases, but some soft cases may fit. Screen protectors fit, though I haven't had to replace the one that came with the phone yet. My phone came with the screen protector already on, my daughter had to put hers on herself.The phone keeps a good charge. It comes with two batteries, but the only way to charge the battery is to have it in the phone. I swap batteries about once a week just to keep a charge on both, but in use the battery never lets me down (I plug it in overnight each night) and I use lots of apps during the day, though I'm pretty fanatical about turning off wifi and bluetooth when I'm not using them (and that kills the in-game ads for a lot of games, since I don't have data on my phone plan.)My daughter and I both love our phones. With the price, the features, and the magnificent display and zippy processor we've been really enjoying them. I'd give hers six stars if I could (since it actually has the 4.1.1 OS inside, I gave mine 5 even though the OS was one version older, but whether I get ICS or Jelly Bean wasn't critical to me.

Does include built-in hotspot feature for Data users. (ex. Sim card settings, sound settings, use settings, show battery percentage, ect) The phone does have a OTA update feature but that doesnt mean that the company has the activity active for future software update pushes. The phone came loaded with the Galaxy s3 launcher for a Samsung like feel, the samsung touch water puddle lockscreen and all the sounds. Statusbar has slideable toggle widgets and GSM profile. The phone has 2 sim card slots for whatever advantages you want to take. I set ours up for Straght Talk. The advertisement says a dual core cpu, the phone declares a quad core! ...not true, Mediatek based chipset but over all perfermance is fantastic. It is not bloated up with advertisments or useless apps, just a home brew port of the Samsung Galaxy Android Software. Almost feels like the company ported over the software from the Galaxy S2 and updated it for Jellybean (Same text app, notes app) . Camera is beautifiull. Fully working flash.

The wall charger will give a full charge in a fraction of the time compared to if you straight charge the battery in the phone.  I did have a few quirks.  The screen was bad about powering off and on, especially in voicemail retrieval, but I re-calibrated one of the settings and that seemed to take care of it.  Overall performance I am definitely pleased with, especially for the money.The only thing major I am having a problem with is I can't send MMS.  I have Straight Talk and I set the new APN to their settings.  This seemed to work because after the new APN was set I could access the internet, but no MMS / Pic messages.  No luck with Straight Talk's customer service, if you could even call it that.  I stopped in a T-mobile store and they tried to help, but informed me that the phone was only running on their Edge service ( signified with the \" E \" over the signal bar ), which would not even support an a MMS message to be sent.

I Should have listened to my gut...Is it too good to be true, an inexpensive touch screen phone? The answer is yes, let me explain.  First, the phone stopped charging three(3), yes three, days after I bought it. I treated it like a baby and it suddenly like a fruit fly, sat there motionless, dead, kaput, paper weight. Second, 3G was incredibly slow. So slow that there was no point of attempting to get on the any web, besides Google,because I often found myself sitting and gazing off into space. For example, when I had full bars Pandora would not load and when it did the songs skipped because it timed out. So I often found myself thinking of the songs I wanted to hear instead of listening to them. (*)Granted, this could be my cell phone provider's service, but I did not experience this with my older 3G phone. (I also read that the batter life is pretty poor while using applications, but was not an issue for me). Lastly, there is VERY VERY limited setting options. So limited that when I eagerly showed the phone off to other people I watched them LAUGH  OUT LOUD at how poor the customization was and the lack of capability, in terms of GPS disable, lowering setting to save battery life, etc it had.To conclude I rate my experience 1/5 stars because it broke, but if not for that 2/5 stars (MAYBE, BUT NOT LIKELY 3/5 stars) because:1) Broke with in 3 days2) SLOW with internet(*)3) VERY limited settings- p.s LESSON LEARNED \"You buy cheap, you buy twice\"  for $50-80 more I could have gotten an incredibly better phone...[...]", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "why should i pay you to send my phone back to me", "Author": "angie", "ReviewID": "R1C14HIUIA0DTB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone i order has a lot of problems the screen,it goes black,it is hard to charge up,you touch the screen to go to one page or site it goes to another on it's on,so i wrote to let the seller know that i wanted to return the phone to have it replaced or fixed,i still have a warranty on the phone,a one year warranty that came with purchase of the phone,i purchased it in January 2013,i was told through an email that the warranty was up to replace it but they would fix it,i don't quiet get that since a year is not up until January 2014 ,the seller said i ,had to send them 25 dollars for the shipping and handling ,i do not think that is fair nor right ,I have to pay already to send it to them to fix,so why should I have to send them 25 dollars to send it back to me after they fix it.that is not right i am still under warranty so I should not have to  eat the cost as people would say both ways, when you read this review let me know if you think that is fair or just wrong. that i should have to pay to send it to them and for it to come back, and thank you for taking the time to read the review and i look forward to reading your opinion on this.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dysfunctional", "Author": "Naomi Mine", "ReviewID": "R317X7458K0J8I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Although the phone came with two batteries, neither would charge.

LOLI was reading their reviews and some of them actually thought that they were purchasing a REAL Galaxy S3!!  WOW!!If people would just take the time to thoroughly read what they are purchasing then this product would be a 4 star product.Anyway, I ordered this on the 11th of May and it shipped on the 12th of May. It came from Hong Kong to California in 2 Days which is AMAZING! But I did not receive it until the 20th because I live on the east coast.About the phone: First impression was that it looks well made. It felt great in my hand an was smooth and sleek looking.When turned on, it took about 5 seconds to get to home screen which isn't bad at all. I first tested the camera... it's not clear like the real galaxy s 3 but it takes pretty decent pictures. I am currently looking for a new camera app because I don't like the one that is installed on the phone.I was able to safely root this phone in under 1 minute using the step-by-step guide provided by Mtk6577GamingRig website. They also have a youtube video showing you how to do it.As soon as I turned on the phone it also connected to my home wifi in 2 seconds! I was shocked as my previous phone (HTC wildfire S) took over 1 minute to connect.I immediately downloaded about 25 of my favorite apps and each app took about 3 seconds to download, so yeah.. this phone is RIDICULOUSLY FAST!Now the cons:The screen brightness is not that bright if you're outside in the sun. It's kind of difficult to see the apps on the screen clearly but once you step in a shaded area then it's easier to see.Battery life isn't great, maybe 3 hours.When you first get the phone you have to use it until it dies all the way and then charge it all the way WITHOUT USING IT until it is 100%. This calibrates the battery & the battery percentages should be more stable.I also recommend getting a battery saver app & downloading advance task killer to remove apps that linger uselessly in the background which kill your battery.But overall this is a great phone. I can live with the screen brightness issue & oh yeah, I am using a net10 at&t; sim card with the phone and I get 3G! The connection is amazing & everything works great (sms, mms, data/internet)!Please feel free to let me know If you have any questions!Thanks!!Also, big thanks to PCTVSHOP for this phone & the amazing shipping. I know you guys had some issues with a past usps shipping agency but I stil appreciate everything that you've done & for your prompt response & professional customer service.Update: 6/6/2013This phone is BAD ASS!I've had it for 2 weeks & 3 days now & it still works just as perfectly as it did the first day I got it!I have yet to drop it *knock on wood* & there have been no random cracking with the screen. Again, I treat it like it is an expensive silk thread. I don't just shove it in my pocket or throw it in my backpack. I always have it in hand or in my soft mini purse (which I bought specifically for this phone since I have yet to find a case that I feel will protect it as is)AGAIN, People NEED to calibrate their batteries when they first get it or else it will just fail miserably!My battery lasts 6+ hours and I use it moderately. I'm always on instagram, snapchat, texting & surfing the web & it last through the whole day of work. & that is with ONE battery.The internet is just as fast, the phone boots up quickly as the first day I received it & everything is functioning the same.I honestly believe that some of these sellers are the reason why some of these phones are junk as they may be altering these phones or sending damaged ones.The people I bought mine from were good & honest vendors.Thanks again to PCTVShop. & thank you for putting me at ease with the guaranteed 1 year warranty.I will update this again 2 weeks from now when I will have had this phone for a month.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's no more than a 3 star", "Author": "Zachary Colson", "ReviewID": "R13ROFO5GK8606", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone a couple months ago expecting a pretty close copy of the s3, well from afar.

Also the screens viewing angle isn't that great, at certain angles the pictures color inverts. The camera quality is only about 2 megapixels also if you use T Mobile like I am you will not get 3G on your phone but only edge service but phones quality for phone calls is great but that's about it. The phone also reaches really high temperatures and can burn you, an app I use tells me that the highest temperature I've reached was 124 Fahrenheit. Also I won't ever go with a no name phone again because I can't find a case that fits correctly it seems to be too big for the cases . If you're using the phone with AT&T; you will get good 3G signal which is awesome on this phone, all in all I won't buy again but not a terrible smartphone just not that good.

Keep in mind a Samsung Galaxy SIII is three times the cost of this phone, so, keeping this in mind, I am going to review the phone hardware not the Android Jelly Bean software installed.  My order was from a seller named  \"Mikoo\" and the shipping took 6 days direct from from China. I was very surprised to have received it so soon.  The phone overall, has good feel of quality about it. It weighs in at 5.2 oz. with the battery installed. The screen has a decent display,(not Amoled in my opinion) however I noticed a slight darkening as you move your viewing angle upward above the screen when you go go \"off-axis\", but when looking from the side or below the screen it was fine. Guess, this would be only an issue if two people were viewing the screen at the same time. The screen is huge compared to what I had before. I believe it's plastic and not glass. The processor seems snappy enough to handle what you throw at it.  Conflicting specs given though..  1.0 ghz listed on the Amazon website, dual core 1.4 ghz listed on the box and 1.5 ghz written on the plastic screen shipping protector.  I don't now what came with the phone, but it is very snappy and no slowdowns.  It came with two batteries.  I DO use both sims on two numbers both at&t; on all day from 7am to 8pm. I browse maybe ten  to 15 minutes/day, stream maybe 30 minutes of Spotify music service and watch maybe 10 minutes of Youtube. I use probably a total of 1 hour of phone calls total/day. Sometimes I use the GPS and WIFI during the day. One battery (2000 mah)barely makes it all day. I would suspect if you only had one sim installed your batty life would improve.  The camera takes surprisingly good pictures however, starting to notice a small pink spot (hardly visible)directly in the middle of the composition of most pictures and the completed picture as well, mostly indoor pictures. Think this might be a software issue.  Not a major thing for me as I'm not too interested in a smart phone camera. The overall quality of the telephone portion of the device is quite remarkable..very good clarity on my end and others say my voice sounds very clear and articulate. The phone is probably the most important part to me.I've used the earphone jack and the external speaker and both are decent.  Still haven't used the bluetooth yet.  I've only had the phone for 4 days now with no issues.

I needed a phone in the meantime since my current phone from T-mobile is a little worn out and a has fallen a few times here and there. Since I don't know if I'll stick to T-mobile or go to a different cell phone provider I decided to try this out for now.What I DO NOT like is the fact that the seller has specified things that aren't true... For example, I was interested in how the camera is said to have 8.0 MP, I thought this was a nice trait given that it's a replica. NOT TRUE, the camera is 2.0 MP and the flash can't even be considered a flash. It barely does anything.The version of android on this phone (or at least on the one they sent me) is 2.0 NOT 4.1They state they ship the phone with one extra batterie, not true... I only received one battery.The sound is okay, there is something up with the headphone jack, I have to \"wiggle\" or move it around in order to get the music to sound \"decent\".I like the look, I like the wide screen, and I think I would've been in love with it IF I would've really received what was being advertised.Again I just think that if I would've known the facts from the start I wouldn't have an issue with the phone.

This is the revised version of review, revised on 10/11/13, I have had the phone now for 2 weeks.I came upon the \"cheap china phones\" when searching for \"used phone\" on line. The sites where I found them were DHGate.com, ahappydeal.com and superzone.com. I was surprised to see these phones with almost S3 specs for under $100 (compared to S3 for $459 even now). Too good to be true. So I wrote an email to many of the sellers asking specifically if they will confirm the specs as listed to be true. Many of them did not reply. Some were honest enough to tell me that they had listed wrong specs and some simply said \"we don't have it in stock\". All these phones were to be shipped from China and there were review after review of how they did not refund money, had to spend $25 on shipping etc. So I cam across this listing on Amazon. I was thrilled. Under the listing there are several sellers listed under \"new others\".Now about Amazon. Unfortunately Amazon, unlike Ebay, does not tell you where the product is going to be shipped from. So, you find it after you receive it that you got it from China. Amazon should change this.There are more than 20 manufacturers of these china phones and they are all different quality. The reviews here have really lumped all of them under one heading but they are many different quality. The phone I received is labelled from SVP and is model S580.Anyway. I ordered it from merchant \"SLIMSHARP\" for only $87. Great price for these specs. He specifies on his listing \"Shipped from California\". So, that and the price were the attraction for me to order it evenif I knew that it may be too good to be true.Prompt shipping and delivery, I received it on 3rd day (within USA, free shipping. Looks just like S3. Good looking. Turned on without problems. Makes phone calls fine. But have problems which I have described below. As it stands now, if the seller sends me the real deal well and good, otherwise I can put him in the category of cheaters.There are several problems with the fulfillment of this order. After fiddling around a bit I was finally able to connect to Google play and download app to check out the specs on this phone in detail.Here is what I found:1. This (S580)is not 3G phone, because it is connecting only to 2G.2. From your listing, this is supposed to have Android version 4.1 but it has 2.3.5.3. The phone was not recognized by my computer through the USB connect. It said \"found new hardware\" but was not able to find a driver. A software CD was not included with the phone. Since this is a generic phone I cannot download it from web either.4. The Amazon listing says \"comes with two batteries\" but only one was included, says \"comes with one screen protector\" but non was included.5. The User Manual is really very insufficient.6. The CPU model is actual MTK6517 while the list says MTK6577 (which is latest in the series).7. RAM is only 256MB and ROM is also 256. External memory can be upto 32GB.8. No GPS9. Camera front is 1.9 better than listed but back is only 1.9 much worse than listed.10 Battery does not last very long but that may be smart phone function and not fault of battery. I turned all the accessory functions off, the WIFI, data connection, any apps running in the back ground, then on mostly standby use it lasted less than 2 days.11. Display screen is 480X800 (WVGA).BY the way: for the specs of the actual phone I received (which is being advertised for any where from $45 to $79) by various vendors, this phone I think is working pretty well. On WIFI internet worked really good. On 2G it was slow.PROBLEM GETTING REFUND: Over the last one week I have been emailing back and forth with SLIMSHARP, the seller, trying to get them to pay for return shipping. Since they messed up and shipped wrong phone, they should pay for shipping. So far no go. So I may have to open a dispute resolution with Amazon.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEWARE GLASS NOT WARRANTEED", "Author": "Delaine H.", "ReviewID": "R3BNJHC2O6UB9F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone except for glass.. mine fell on a rug twice &severly; cracked in 3 places.

The one I received had a broken volume control. I contacted the seller who replied quickly with the suggestion to \"short press\" the control. Not sure what that means. But the only way I was able to get the volume to work was by installing a 3rd party app, but that ended up being too much of a pain to adjust when on a call. Other than that the phone was good. It was of \"Knock Off\" quality, but good for the price.I'm sure if I would have replaced it with another that the replacement would have been fine. The only other issue I had with it, and it's a minor one, was with the Page Dots (I have no idea what they're actually called. The 5 or 6 dots on the bottom you can touch to rotate to a given page.) I was only able to swipe the screen to turn the page. Touching the dots did not work like it does on my Galaxy S III work phone. I admit that I do not know if that is by design or if it's another flaw with the phone I had.In the end I decided to return it and get a real Samsung Galaxy S III (mini) for $150 more. For me it was worth it to have a higher quality phone.

It's fragile (as well as S3), so you need to buy rubbery case immediately!3. Some android application translated to English (by Chinese translator I guess) incorrectly. For example when you send text message, field \"To\" named \"From\". But you can install alternative android text messages app if you want.4. Default photo camera give sound, and no settings to remove it. I removed it by rooting and renaming sound file.5. You may charge it every day.. as well as S3. So I bought second set of wall and car micro USB chargers. And \"train\" the battery.6. It came with 2 feet micro USB cable for computer, which is too short if your PC on the floor. I bought additional 5ft micro USB cable for it.7. Very limited manual.. go and get Android 4 manual on internet.Pros:1. Excellent look, like S32. Quality of pictures is very high.3. Android 4.1 is flying quick on it4. Two SIM cards. You can buy cheap local SIM card as first and expencive national wide as second and save money by this.

Although this is suppose to be a S3 replica, don't expect the same performance. However, with that said, this phone is no complete slouch either. The performance is similar to that of the US T-mobile Galaxy S2 (from comparison of quadrant and Antutu benchmark tests). That is still \"the S2 speed\" at half the price. Plus it comes with Android 4.1. Mine came with a case and extra battery. I'm not sure if that is a part of the deal but it's a nice surprise.CON: No root support. If there is a place for root support, it's likely to be in Chinese. Some apps like the google Map are incompatible with the market updates. You will not be able to update or remove because it is a part of the system app (need root access to remove). It will work fine without the update so it's not so bad. Some settings seems to be missing, like sounds and ringtone setting. Although you can set this through other apps like Zedge, it should definitely be a part of the phone. Limited protective case.Other thought: I have the S3 and I bought this phone for my little brother. Although some of the Apps are not compatible with updates and there is no root support, this is perfect for him as he is only a beginner Android user. Because this is not a known production phone in US, it's very hard to find protective cases. Although it comes with a nice case, I personally prefer something different. For someone who is looking to save money on a basic android phone with good performance --> This is definitely an excellent choice.

Garbage! Worthless,would love to break into tiny little bits! I expect a phone to last at least a year with no major issues, but this little thing has been one ongoing problem after another! Just bought an LG from straight talk to replace this. Should have just spent the extra money at first! PEOPLE! it will impress you for the first little bit, then it will make you want to slam it into a wall-HARD.UPDATE!!!! Had the phone for several months now. Found a gel cover from china that fits it finally. Dropped it, broke the screen, but it still works so I'm good with that. Really bugs me cause I take great care of my stuff and have never broken a phone. It still goes off alot, still freezes up. New annoyance is NO storage, and it will no hold a charge. I'm not the kind of person that has 30apps and music, I have 5 apps, that's it. If I knew then what I do now, probably would have passed. But I have noticed alot of bad comments about customer service, I got mine at lolbuy, and they have been awesome and always fast to respond. If your going to try it, get it from them.I like this phone OK. Take into consideration I have been using a blackberry for 4+ years however and this is a total change for me. I had to have a phone compatible with straight talk thus the blackberry had to go. This phone is fast, web is great. Love the voice command option and talk to txt. It actually understands me, southern drawl included. I hate texting on it, but I hate txting on any touch screen, again, I had a blackberry. Had some issues with it, and daniel chen was very promt in his reply. Most Issue's are resolved, but some are still there. It freezes up and you have to take the battery out over and over until it decides to come back on and very very often it will not sent txt msg, rather give me an error msg. I have no clue how to fix this, i'm thinking it's just not set to keep trying to send it if the other person is out of range or something, idk. And as far as the freezing up, I watched a friend of mine with a \"real\" samsung having the same problem. Camera and speaker are not great. Overall, Its worth the money. I would buy it again. Shipping was super fast from lol buy and it was packaged very very well. Took me 10min's just to open it.

I replied asking them what phones I could trade it for, took over another week to reply even though I sent several messages.

I did contact the seller and they did offer a return. The window however for me shut quickly as I was overseas for over two weeks and then I had the phone a bit prior to traveling.

I'd have to handle the phone slowly or carefully so it wouldn't have a fit.Also it changes my screen back to the defualt \"wave\" wallpaper it came with when you first turn it on.

For one, the battery life isn't that great, but I thought it was because I was using apps, texting, and talking on it so much. Maybe it's because I use my phone a lot, but I didn't think that the phone would continue to die every hour, I don't use it THAT MUCH. Secondly, my sync on my phone keeps having issues. One minute the sync says it's working, and everything is fine, and the next it's not and I can hardly use ANY of my social networking apps (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)Sometimes the sync says everything is working, and I STILL seem to be having problems with those apps; that's really my biggest problem with this phone. Also, this phone seems to be very sensitive, so if I'm making a phone call if I press my face against the phone it seems to hang up on the person I'm speaking to at the moment, which causes problems for me. Also, when I'm making a phone call, sometimes I can't hear the person on the other line, and when I call them back, I'm able to hear them. Furthermore, when I'm making a phone call, I tend to hear static when making the call. The volume isn't that great after a while either. I really wouldn't recommend this phone, and honestly, I wish I would've waited to get another phone and just continued to save my money to get another android, but I hope that I'll be able to figure out how to make this phone work better. When it works it works well, but it's not consistent enough for me, so that's why I have so many problems with it.

IF that's possible!This phone was AWESOME until by the end of the first week the charge plug on the bottom started to move and stop charging. By the second week, it was a real battle to get it to charge at all. I sent it back the end of the second week... ALL THE WAY TO CHINA! DUH! DON\"T GO THERE! Months later the guy calls me asking why I didn't send it to the Michigan guy! WHAT! WHY DIDN\"T YOU TELL ME!? This is the first of the STALL techniques to get us past the 2 year warrantee and the \"A to Z guarantee\"!Allegedly he repaired it and sent it back months later. The day I got it back I lightly bumped the cord while setting it down to charge and it quit charging until I slightly bumped it back! I had decided the bad design flaw plug would be charged while not being used or held. No luck, it failed first day. I thought it might hold up with my new gentle treatment. No luck there either. In a day or so it wasn't charging again, and I hadn't barely used it! It took a while to get the time to deal with this clown to insist on a replacement phone that doesn't have this issue. Then, he would only agree to send a used replacement. Well, why not... I was just going to sell it because I never got rid of my iPhone and I can't afford this issue. Well, stall after stall, and low and behold I got a replacement a couple of weeks ago from Michigan - through China, with the months of waiting!WHAT!!!!!!!!! I opened the box. It was damaged from being dropped on a corner and the screen protector they never took off had a huge scratch across it! Hummm... not so interesting, right? Well, I got the dead batteries charged in a couple of days and started her up, see. And, there on the phone was this other persons accounts and data and pictures of this African American woman looking sprite. LOL WHAT? WHAT? LOL NO WAY! So, I DO a \"Factory reset\"! ME! I DO IT! NOT HIS MICHIGAN GUY! ME! I got a call. The proximity sensor doesn't work, and I can't end the call!  Not only that, but the touch screen won't scroll! It clicks in to whatever is at the point where you start to scroll; and, no way are you going to get anything done! NEVER! So, I be-ightch this guy out! Demand an over night tracking number for a NEW REPLACEMENT WORKING PHONE! I bought NEW, I want NEW that works - mine never did! I bought this phone about Jan 3, 3013, it is July 24 2013 now! He's had my phone in Michigan for about a month now - confirmed delivered! Do I get a phone or tracking number? NO! NO! NO! Stall after stall after stall! Now he is on vacation again - or now just back - for the third time in 7 months! .... a month vacation each! NOW, he has to send one from China, and his Michigan guy can send it when he get them! WHAT? What's that guy for? Can you say STALL?This isn't HALF the story! I called Amazon last night on something else they helped me with, and I brought it up about Standard-Mart. They filed a complaint. Now today, they have a different name: SHIFENG FENG, and something else.OK, this isn't so much about the phone entirely. Sorry, BUT, if you buy from afar, expect the worst! This problem with the phone isn't that big a deal, if it's done right, and your careful. The phone otherwise is incredible! LIKE I WROTE ORIGINALLY: AWESOME!CONTACT THE SELLER! READ THEIR REVIEWS! I did forgot to review the seller in time... they're gone now anyway; but back as another, and another, and another...! BEWARE, buy fair!----------------------------------------- It did not still have the problems of original reviews ---------------------------AWESOME! NONE of the problems noted on earlier posts! They may well have debugged all that by now! I'm techie, so I'm happy with the first months use. It takes some learning curve, like all else after using iPhone and others. No problem there. I kept my iPhone until I knew all is well... GREAT, actually! LOLWell worth the lower price from the S3! Downloading apps and live wallpapers and ringtones is a cinch! I love the big screen. I had to adjust my hand hold a bit, of course. The SD Card 32G is awesome! I mean, I can have all the SD cards I want! AND, one is plenty! No need for much phone memory, except the Gig of RAM and higher ROM is nice. Higher RAM for wed and Netflix etc.iPhone is junk comparitively! This phone tethers to my other computers, tablets and wifi/bluetooth better than the iPhone ever did! LOL Browsers time out more, where iPhone hangs on forever and you never know if to wait.

It is a total piece of junk. Within 2-3 weeks I started seeing dust and gunk inside the phone underneath the screen. When I asked the seller about this I was told to use the case to prevent it (I had the case on since day 1) and was then told dust in the screen is frustrating but normal for phones. This is probably my fifth smartphone in 10 years and never have I had this problem.Then after having it for about 2months the screen cracked across the width of the phone right in front of my eyes while texting. I always take care of my devices, however, with this phone it apparently doesn't matter. It just randomly falls apart.Also take notice of the quadband name and specs on the screen in the picture, which is how the phone comes packaged. It most certainly IS NOT a quad core cpu and IS NOT an amoled screen. The camera is also the worst I've ever seen.In regards to the seller, I gave them 2 stars but wish I would have given them one. During this whole process I was just informed multiple times about the legalities of why they don't have to give a refund, and even told that customer service people must not like me. I understand there are people who would take advantage of this if these return policies weren't in place, but the bottom line to me is, if you sell junk, you sell junk. Good thing you can fall back on these policies which come in effect right as the phone starts crapping out.So if you're interested in this phone, ask yourself one question. When you spend $200 on a phone, how long do you expect it to last? One year? Maybe two?

Got hot very quickly.  would shut off on me.  I did tried recording my voice when I setup my voicemail I could hardly be heard.  I had to practically yell into the phone.  I also tried to use microphone on the keyboard instead of typing and it, would not do anything. The light comes on going around in circles red saying that it was listening, but it wasn't typing anything as I was speaking. The other problem that I was having is when I make a call, I get an error message that says \"The SIM card that you are about to use is roaming. No local Sims is available now would you like to continue.\" I called the service provider that I subscribed with  and we did some troubleshooting on the phone.  I even tried changing the SIM card from slot 1 to slot 2 and it still would not recognize a SIM card. It still kept giving the same error message.  Also the memory slot is having a hard time reading the memory card.  I have tried to go to settings storage and  unmount and mount  SD card, but it won't do it. I have to power down the phone and turn it back on again before it can read the SD card. Another problem that I was having is the return button on the bottom right hand corner of the phone is not responding. The home key works and so does the menu key, but  when I tried to depress the Return button it would not respond. I had to again power down the phone and start it back up again.  The signal on the phone also is changing a lot. I can be sitting in the same place and make a call and the moment that I make a call the bars are registering full strength of signal and then all of a sudden it'll go down to 1 signal or no signal at all. I think that this is way too many problems to be having on a phone that I  had for only a week. The more and more I have it in my possession the more things I'm starting to find out that are going wrong with it.  It could be that this is just one  defective phone of the bunch but I'm starting to get a little nervous spending the money that I did for something that is not working properly.

But I decided I'll just return it and get my refund, so they sent me an mailing label that I had to print off . Before I mailed it off I received another battery, so I tried it and all it did was light up and make noise, I couldn't even see the screen.So of course I returned it and had to pay postageand tracking, it took about 3 weeks until I finally got my refund.
