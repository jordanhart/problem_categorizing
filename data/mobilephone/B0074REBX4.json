{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Happy With The iPhone 4S", "Author": "Stacy G.", "ReviewID": "R3GULPP0U8MPH9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For years, I've been using Android phones. From the T-Mobile My Touch (HTC Glacier) to the Samsung Galaxy II, I enjoyed them but always wanted an iPhone. So recently when my contract was up with T-Mobile (thank God!) I purchased a white 16GB iPhone 4S & I'm loving it!! I was going between the iPhone 5 & the 4S, I talked to several people who knew the iPhone well, basically I was told that by updating the 4S which I did, it's basically the same as the 5, I just don't get the 4G speeds, which honestly I don't feel I need. I even took my 4S back to Verizon to exchange for the 5 & the salesperson talked me out of it! I figure when my time comes to upgrade, the iPhone available then will be amazing! This is perfect for the first time iPhone user, very easy to operate, I love Siri, easy to schedule appointments & find places to eat. I prefer the white because it looks clean & classy, even though I have mine safely encased in a Case Mate Phantom, which is a great case, better than the Otterbox. 16GB is perfect for me because I don't put tons of apps on my phones or store lots of pictures. I will get the 32 or 64GB when I upgrade just to have the extra room. I highly recommend the iPhone 4S 16GB, it's the best investment I've made in a long time, I'm extremely happy I didn't go with the Samsung Galaxy SIII, it's too large for me.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broken iPhone", "Author": "linda williams", "ReviewID": "R21C4K4T2Q4KSQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought an iPhone off you for $360 and it turns out it was deffective...

No crashes, easier to use than Android's UI (user interface), and so much more customizable options available. Previously I owned a Motorola Droid Bionic and within the first month, the onscreen keyboard stopped working so I traded that in for an iPhone 4S. I chose the white one and was very pleased with it except for the consistently slow 3G speeds. That is the only problem I've had with Apple's iPhone 4S. I traded in my 4S about 3 months ago for this stupid Droid Razr and I have to say it's like night and day. Ever since the upgrade to ICS on the Razr, the network is noticeably bogged down, slow and my keyboard doesn't function properly once again! I am saving up right now to purchase another iPhone 4S. I would so much rather have that phone than this crappy Android. I'm serious. If you're an Android fan, you should consider switching. iOS is so much more fun and easier to use than ICS. Customer service on Apple's side is much better too. No real complaints on this end!

I know you're not supposed to say that about Apple products, but read on to see why I think people are largely \"drinking the Koolaid\" on the iPhone.The Bad:  When I first wanted a smartphone I got a very cheap Droid, which was hard to sync between the Mac home computer I use and my Google email accounts.  Eventually I got it working, but I anticipated that the almighty iPhone would be seamless right out of the box.  It wasn't -- with the iPhone I had all the same troubles going back to the Google accounts that I had had with the Droid going to the Apple products the first time around.  Not fun.I also didn't like that there is NO app available to back SMS text messages up to your Gmail or other email account the way there is for Android phones (SMS Backup+).  In the event of a phone change, and god forbid you do not want another iProduct, you will lose all of those conversations.I couldn't organize the screens the way I wanted them.I missed having my contacts' pictures show up next to text messages and in my phone address book.  (It's the little things, but still!)The \"back\" menus will probably frustrate former Droid users, as sometimes you have to use the actual butto at the bottom of the phone to go back to the Home screen, but sometimes you want the real \"back\" button on the screen which is usually (but not always) located at the top.  This is counterintuitive and annoying.The Good:  The camera worked well, the screen was beautiful and the sound was good.  Size is great compared to the other expensive Android models which are a bit like holding an entire computer up to your head.  Also, there are no rights issues with older iTunes purchases which I have yet to resolve on my new Android.The Verdict:  Overall I was disappointed in the operating system I think largely because the iPhone is supposed to be the gold standard among smartphones and I had heard wonderful, glowing things from so many people who LOOOOVE their iPhones.  However, naysayers come out of the woodwork once they realize that they will have a sympathetic ear in someone who isn't subscribing blindly to the iUniverse, and there are a fair number of people who prefer the Droids.  To me the final factor may be how computer-savvy you are going in, and how much time you want to put into learning about your phone and all the different service providers and programs that will, in theory at least, work together to get it to do what you want it to do.  If you're willing to take the time, you might eventually prefer an Android.  If not, the iPhone is definitely not as simple as I thought it would be but I would still recommend it for anyone who doesn't have the technological know-how or desire to play detective in order to get things set up.I will add that when combined with trying to find the right cellular service provider (Verizon has NONEXISTANT customer service and everything requires several phone calls as well as hours on hold to get anything done, AT&T; has less signal strength in my area and I couldn't get usable data to with T-Mobile through Straight Talk), buying a new phone and a smartphone in particular has been one of THE most frustrating experiences of my life.  Once I get my current phone working (a Samsung Galaxy S3), I plan to keep it forever and to never, ever, ever make any changes to my \"system\" again!
