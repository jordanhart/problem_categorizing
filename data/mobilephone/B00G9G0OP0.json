And well I'm not sure quite if I like it to tell you the truth.  I was expecting it to be the same size as the original s4 or s4 active... It isn't sadly so I'm disappointed there, but I was an iPhone fan a few yrs ago and this is about the same size as the iPhone so I guess that can be a plus!Anyway we are planning a trip to Disney with the kids ages 8,5,and 2 so I was like a digital camera and cell in one, can you say yes!  Well I got it in the other day and was playing around with it and the camera produces some great pics!!  So we shall see how it goes with disney, update later...", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "A phone camera...", "Author": "Patrick Byington \"Strangely Engaging\"", "ReviewID": "R2M14QE8TKCUXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife loves this phone!  Granted, it isn't as powerful as some other devices, but she didn't want it for that.  She wanted it to take stellar pictures when/wherever.  And it does that wonderfully.  Finding a case for it is a bit of a pain, and it is a bit heavy, but I haven't heard her complain.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesomw phone", "Author": "deb graham", "ReviewID": "R2CM7VCPUEBVGA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is it a camera or is it a phone?

Well, apparently Samsung doesn't think that way.1.5 generations ago, on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, without unlocking the phone, I can take photos. Just push the power button and swipe to the left to make the camera lock screen widget appear. Here we are, 2 years later and we've taken a step backward.The only way to conveniently use the most important feature on the Galaxy S4 Zoom, its camera, is to completely disable the lock screen. However, that is not an option for anyone who cares about the data on their phone, the accounts it has access to or accesses corporate email with their phone. Oddly enough, you can't even use lock screen widgets if you choose password, pin, pattern, etc. Basically, anything other than swipe to unlock disables the option to use lock screen widgets. If you like your SoundHound lock screen widget, that also won't be an option here. Really weird.It's a very disappointing software flaw on an otherwise awesome piece of hardware. I hope Samsung will release a software update that resolves this!Update: I have noticed the device often wakes up in my pocket. This is strange given the tiny power button is well designed and very hard to accidentally press, but it turns out that Samsung decided it would be good to have a hardware home key that also wakes the device up and not offer any option to disable this. So if something is pressing on the face of the phone, the phone will wake up. It also happens that the face of the phone is where the emergency dialer is. After pocket dialing 911, I am officially upset about this software flaw too.I hope Samsung is listening and makes the minor software fixes to correct these major deficiencies.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "for a phone my don't have", "Author": "henry jasper trotter", "ReviewID": "R2XRPMJFYE1DMM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Because I don't have the telephone some kinda way the phone got lost and I'm being charged for the phone and I don't have it and your company tell me that I need to get a police report that's not my fault so I'm not happy with the situation", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "NULL", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom, White 16GB (AT&T;)", "ImgURL": "NULL", "ProductID": "B00G9G0OP0"}}
