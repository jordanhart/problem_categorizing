Phone was locked although it was advertised as an unlocked phone.  No success getting any assistance from vendor, OEM Planet!  Absolutely no customer service.  In addition, they blamed Amazon who in turn blamed OEM Planet for sending a locked phone.  No assistance from Amazon either.  Got the unlocked code from ATT and the directions did not match the prompt from the LG phone.  Instead of asking for the unlock code, I asked for the PUK code.  Apparently, if you entered the wrong number 5 times, the phone is permanently locked for ATT.  What a shame because although I had the unlocked code, I could not unlock it.  Maybe the phone was already returned from another customer and I was given a second hand phone?  In any case, I am the victim of fasle advertisement - this phone is NOT unlocked.  Shame on Amazon and OEM Planet for providing the wrong item to customers and not resolving this issue in a acceptable manner - apparently, I am not the first one and the product is still in the market.  Do yourself a favor, do not purchase from OEM Planet.  I would have hoped that Amazon would have done the right thing and investigate other's claims and remove that item from their website.  This would have avoided others to have such a bad experience.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unlocked - TG", "Author": "P.

I was worried after reading recent reviews about it not being unlocked.  Thankfully I had no problem and phone works well on a T-Mobile network.  Before using the phone I updated all the software for the phone.  This took at least 90 minutes.  It updated to Windows 7.5.  I had to also install Zune software on my PC in order to update the phone and copy over music and photos.We have T-Mobile and the phone is set up for ATT.  It is annoying that the ATT options are still on the menu.  Can't get rid of them.  I was surprised by the weight of the phone, a lot heavier than an i-phone, but then it cost 75% less.My wife uses the text option the most, so the slide-out keyboard is a very handy option.So far this phone is working great.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "ALBERTO BORBON CASTRO", "ReviewID": "R3O87F7ZJV6KN8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Moving up from an HTC TyTN II, this Quantum C900 is all I could ask for:  thiner, larger, faster, sharper, easier to use and fancier!  Just by turning it on I noticed what a big difference it was.The OS is quite friendly and powerful.  Company's Exchange Server sync was perfect since the the start.  So far I have no complains regarding Windowsphone.  I have not updated it to Windowsphone 7.5 yet, but honestly, do not feel the need to do it...although I will certainly upgrade it.  There are not as many Apps at Microsoft's Marketplace as Apple has for the iPhones or iPads: theirs have been around longer..but I was able to get most of what I wanted for free.  Other bright side:  Apps price is quite low compared to what I have paid before for Palm or even Windows Mobile programs.  Hopefuly in a few months I will get the Apps I am now missing.Hardware wise the phone seems very well built: it feels heavy and sturdy; also fewer moving parts will probably mean less problems down the road.  The only thing I do not like is that the phone is an AT&T; unlocked phone, not an LG OEM phone:  BIG difference when it comes to support:  LG will not handle it and neither will AT&T; if you are not with them.  The seller probably has a warranty agreement with ONE shop...but that certainly limits your options.Bottom line:  Excelent value for money.

I'm currently using it with T-Mobile, though it might be worth mentioning that 3G data isn't available when using this phone with said carrier since the 3G radio works on AT&T;'s frequencies. To be more concise: if you're using this phone with T-Mobile, you're stuck on EDGE. This isn't a problem for me, since most of my browsing takes place on Wi-Fi networks, with the carrier's data plan being used almost solely for the occassional email.I'm very impressed with Windows Phone -- I purchased this phone as my introduction to the OS -- which runs smoothly even on the lower-end specs that this phone boasts (particularly 256M of RAM). The OS is friendly, and my subjective perception of its performance is similar to that of the much higher-spec'd iPhones that family members have. Yes, they have some Apps that I'd like, but that's the price for going with the underdog... I particularly love the way the back button works in the OS and the apps, and was frustrated by the lack of it while setting up company email on coworkers' Android phones the other day. You can get spoiled pretty quickly.The camera takes decent pictures, good enough for the touristy-type photos that I actually take. Someone with an interest in photography might not be impressed; I don't know. For my casual needs it works just fine.I've never been interested in slide-out keyboards -- they always seemed pointless and kind of silly looking to me -- but I have to admit that it actually is convenient when using Word in landscape mode. In fact, now it's probably going to be disappointing when I upgrade and the choices with landscape keyboards turn out to be limited.All in all, I'm very impressed with this phone. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a budget-friendly smartphone without getting tied down in a contract. Here's to hoping LG decides to make some more Windows Phones!** CORRECTION **The phone actually has 512 megabytes of RAM. I mentioned 256 above, and I don't know where I got that number from. This was verified by creating a simple app that called DeviceStatus.DeviceTotalMemory, which returned a result just over 500 million bytes. So it's really not a bad deal for the price!", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Had it for a while, now.", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R2KXYJX5PVA4OJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought a pair of these LG Quantum C900 phones from AT&T; by signing a 2-year commitment.  Probably not what most Amazon shoppers would do, but it worked for us.  The 5 MP camera works great for stills, although it is a challenge to hold the shutter button halfway down (which you need to do in order to make the autofocus and auto lighting work).  What makes this tricky is that the back third of the phone is a slide-away QWERTY keyboard (great for texting or typing in websites, but a pain when it slides out from behind the main phone when you are trying to hit the shutter or the other button that's on the right side of the phone).We might get silicone cases for our phones, both for protection and to keep the keyboard on the back from sliding out, since we use the camera functions WAY WAY more often than we use the QWERTY keyboard function.  Why have a full QWERTY keyboard and not use it, you ask?  The onscreen keyboard works just fine, and it's plenty big when you rotate the phone into the wide position (landscape) instead of the tall position (portrait).  In fact, if we had been fully aware of the automatically rotating screen function that most of these phones seem to have, and the pretty good onscreen keyboard functions, we probably would have chosen a phone without the bigger slide-away QWERTY keyboard.  Only a dedicated texter who doesn't take many pictures can really appreciate this phone for what it is.One other issue... this is a Windows 7 phone.  What that means is, if you want to use the workable mobile versions of the Microsoft Office components (Word, Excel, etc.) you have them all pre-loaded on the phone. I am told that the mini version of Outlook \"syncs\" with you home PC, but I have never tried that, and don't really want to...I'll leave that to more intrepid souls who have bluetooth set up on their PCs or laptops.The downside of Windows 7 Phones:  nowhere near as many free apps as you get with an iPhone or Android phone.The upside of Windows 7 Phones:  if you are careful with your settings, you can protect your privacy, which you really can't do with the other phones, from what I've heard.Update: We got these phones as part of an AT&T; U-Verse package.  So we started out with free streaming of recorded TV content including Nick Jr. and PBS which we love.  A couple of months after I wrote the review above, AT&T; sent us an apologetic letter about how they would be \"discontinuing our support of the U-Verse mobile app on all Windows 7 phones.  When I asked the AT&T; store to exchange our phones for Android phones which would allow us to keep using the U-Verse mobile service, they said not until your 2-year contract ends.  So we cancelled our AT&T; cell phones and AT&T; home phone and went to Verizon.  Soon we will be totally disconnecting U-Verse and getting the cheapest broadband internet connection we can find, because we discovered we can stream Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime through our standard Wii box.

It appears to be a U.S. Model and not overseas.- Inserted only the battery and charged for 3 hours for a full charged as stated from instructions.- I turned on phone and all functions worked well including wi-fi though youtube videos did not play.- You have to use 'Zune' to transfer music, videos, photos and to update the phone.- I installed 'Zune' and plugged phone into computer via USB.- In Zune, I selected the 'phone icon' and update.  It took 1 1/2 hours to update. The update was without error and the phone is now updated to \"Mango\", Windows 7.5.  ((I read there is another update, Windows 7.5 refresh to be released the summer of 2012)).- I tested the phone after the update, all worked well and playing youtube videos works now. (note: I've only used the phone for about 3days so far. I am not a heavy texter or talker, just use the phone to be accesible to my kids and husband. I purchased a \"wi-fi\" phone to keep me occupied for times when I have to wait for awhile.)- I inserted the sim, networked locked. I was kinda freaked but recalled another experience of an unlocked phone I had purchaced for my spouse. The first phone, GarminAsus, I inserted the sim and the networked was locked. I took out the sim and installed it 4 different ways/times. I guess the way a sim card is inserted varies among different phones, it worked. So with this LG quantum, I took out my sim and reinserted in a different way: The phone works and now able to make calls.  To avoid Data charges I :* Under settings:  CELLULAR- turned off data  PHONE UPDATE: disabled data connecton for update notificatons.  WI-FI: I turned on and connected to my home wi-fi network to browse. (Disable to save battery)* Also, if you press without releasing the icons, you're given the option to: Pin to start or uninstall. I uninstalled the ATT links.* I find this only works with a wi-fi connection: Holding down the windows button prompts the ability to give a verbal command. As to say, \"Text John Doe\" then you tell it what to type and it does. Or you can tell it to look up something on the internet.***** I cannot compare this product to other smart phones, for this is my first.  I have been using the same flip phone for YEARS! I hope this phone will work well for a few years too. A Free smart phone from my carrier  requires a minimum of $15 dollars extra a month for a data plan. So $15 x 12 months x 2 years =  $360. Sure there is insurance to purchase in case you damage the phone but thats about $5 month x's 12 months x 2 years= $120.  I purchased this phone for 152 and chose free shipping, that's money saved (even if this phone gives out within a year and I have to purchase another).

Hopefully both will help you make your buying decision.The phone is very well built. It's the perfect size and also has a nice hefty weight to it. Some people might see that as a drawback I suppose, but I like it. It feels good and solid in your hand. The battery seems to hold a charge pretty well. Most smartphones are battery suckers and this one is probably no better or worse than the rest in that regard, but it's held up just fine for me so far. As for the Windows Phone OS, there are enough reviews on that elsewhere so I'm not going to go into that too much. I like it because I still have my e-mail through Hotmail (yes, I'm the one you heard about) and it also puts my Xbox Live account on there.The phone arrived quickly through Amazon, a day before it was scheduled to arrive even. Unboxing it was... interesting. For starters, the phone is advertised as \"brand new\" and the actual phone itself certainly is, but there are some oddities. For one, the box it came in wasn't the box for that phone. It was an LG box but the s/n on it was different. Once inside, it had all the proper doucmentation from LG and the phone itself looked to be factory sealed. If it had ever been removed from the box before, you could have fooled me. Not so much as a scratch or fingerprint anywhere. So that part is all good. The battery, however, is very obviously not a genuine LG battery. Anybody over the age of 8 could look at it and tell you it's a cheap Chinese knockoff. But it works fine (for now) so just take into account when you price this phone that you may be looking at buying a new battery sooner than later. Oddly enough, the battery door isn't an original LG either. It fits fine and in the end it's just a little piece of metal so who really cares, but clearly the \"Windows Phone\" text printed on the bottom is not in the proper font.So the bottom line for me is this: Great phone, I like it alot. Also a good buying experience from Amazon.** UPDATE ** Now that I've had the phone for a couple of weeks, I'd like to give an update on the Chinese knockoff battery. My wife has the HTC Trophy running the same version of Windows Phone as my LG. Last Saturday, we both just kinda hang around the house all day and neither one of us touched our phones at all. At the end of the day, hers showed the battery to be at around 85% or so but my LG was still at almost 100%. My daily usage has never drained the battery to below 60% yet either, so my verdict is that the battery seems to be performing just fine.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG Quantum C900 Unlocked AT&T; Phone: sold by Phone Etc.", "Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "R2V3M7VE27Z8XK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seller: Phone Ect.This phone came in PERFECT.

The battery door is a nice reassuring piece of metal. This is probably one of the few times I've ever seen LG put some metal on the exterior of their phone. The screen doesn't look as easing as it doesn't feel like super-high quality glass, though the screen itself is magnificent. The keyboard mechanism has a solid open and close sound and feels like it won't slide off its rails. The phone is quite heavy and it might be a bit too heavy but a good portion of the weight makes me feel safe it won't be destroyed easily.Screen: It's clear, bright and vibrant. This screen shows some of the best color ever for a LCD screen. The reds, oranges, etc. look amazing and rich. It's quite responsive, more so than my Zune HD. The screen feels nonabrasive.Camera: It's ok. Clearly not the best here by any means. The photos have much detail but color reproduction is off. I find myself having to use the built-in(Mango 7.5 only) auto-fix option to at least make the pictures look good. For a 5MP camera in 2012, it's sub-par. The Samsung Focus is supposedly even better. Also, flash does a good job at lighting the image up but it's not blisteringly bright.Sound: The phone has ok sound. The speaker phone distorts slightly at the top end of the volume and isn't recommended for anything serious. The headphone output is actually very good. It pumps out stronger and deeper bass and volume overall than the Zune HD which for many songs I have to put it to the max volume to hear it well. For this phone, around 20 or 19/30.Buttons: I kind of dislike them as they are flush to the surface, nearly. The volume rocker is too thin and has little travel. The Windows key is the only good physical key (back and search are touch-sensitive). Camera key is a little small and needs to jut out a little more and be wider for it to be a perfect 2 stage camera key.The power button is in an ok position(i would like it on the right-hand side) and again is too flush.Battery: The battery is a pretty sizable at 1500 mAh. The battery lasts for a while. It is better than the Blackberry I used to have.Call quality: Tones are very nice and strong. The speaker phone is nice and loud. The phone locks on to AT&T;'s network really quickly and has very strong reception.

Thankfully, frustration turned to enthusiasm after I went online to purchase an unlock code.Initially this AT&T; branded (and allegedly unlocked) phone would not work when I put my Bell Mobility (a Canadian cell service provider) SIM in it. Instead it presented with the following pop up: \"This sim card can only be used on specific networks. Contact your customer service centre for the PAC code\".  After calling my service provider to no avail, and then heavy use of the internet trying to troubleshoot on my own, I finally pulled the trigger and paid for an unlock code for this allegedly unlocked phone -- that did the trick, allowing me to have a working phone under the tree with three days to spare!Now that the phone works, and with my pre-gift-wrapping fooling around with it finished, I can say that I love the Windows Phone 7.5 (\"Mango\") operating system (which, notably, was an easy \"Zune\" update from the 7.0 OS that came pre-installed).  Further, the OS is not only beautiful to look at, but responsive to touch commands, and extremely intuitive. There also seems to be a significant number of free and/or age appropriate Games and Apps in the Zune marketplace. As the current owner of a Nokia N8 with Symbian S^3, I am now all pumped to upgrade to the Windows Phone OS when it is time buy my next Nokia.As for the LG Quantum handset itself, I expect it will be a nice size for my son's smaller hands; and appears to be a quality build, with decent audio at my end of conversations. My only material critism regarding initial build quality focuses on the metal rear panel that covers the battery.  That panel did not seat/fit smoothly, but with some adjustment/bending of one of the tiny metal tabs attached to the panel, I was able make the panel nest properly, achieving the fit and finish one would expect of a brand new phone.Overall, I am very hopeful that my son -- who desperately wanted the prohibitively expensive iPhone for Christmas -- will be as happy with this LG Quantum in the longterm as I am at this early juncture.

Garstang", "ReviewID": "R1X8SCFHHK1WHU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered phone from Blutekusa.  Came very quick and while I was worried about the New condition from other posts this phone came brand new and factory sealed just as they stated.  It has a nice back cover too that snaps on in an interesting way that I can imagine the knock-offs get wrong.So far my only Cons I wouldn't even consider Cons, but areas of improvement (Updated a couple 1/19/2012 after using the phone longer):- Even though the latest Windows updates enabled it, LG hasn't turned on Hidden Wifi Access Point support, so you will need a named wireless connection for that.- Zune is needed for everything. (Including updates, no OTA Updating)  It is almost a 400MB download of which the first 100MB+ file was useless and just downloaded the other.  It also only installs on WinXP SP3/Vista/Win7, so pretty limited.  There is a registry tweak for the USB driver to make the Storage location visible, but while I was able to see it the phone appears twice in Explorer, shows storage and available space, and won't copy anything to it.  I also had to remove the registry tweak that didn't work to make Zune function again which the article never mentioned.- Phone supports HSDPA up to 7Mb download, but I only get 100K-1M even after tweaking things with the hidden MFG app.  Others mention seeing the H icon too while mine only shows E and 3G. After playing with it forever and contacting LG and ATT I've just determined the phone to be defective since the MFG app even shows the module for HSDPA as inactive.- Keyboard is great, but the button for space is made with 2 contacts under it which clicks weird...sometimes even a second click is felt.  It has never typed two spaces, but it does feel weird.  The Shift and Fn buttons are a little hard to press as others mention, but not a deal breaker.- Discovered today that I'm unable to submit files in web forms, so uploading photos and such are out of the question.Pros:Phone works great.  I have yet to have it crash or freeze.  First thing you need to do is get your MFG app enabled and remove the ATT-US link so you get updates ATT isn't releasing...I didn't do this until the end and got the last update they didn't deploy now.  Doing this in the beginning could have enabled Hidden Wifi, but untested.  You can Developer unlock while in there for further capabilities too.  I'm somewhat in agreement that it isn't 100% unlocked since I had to do this plus the fact that it has ATT Apps and Box.  The latest Windows updates are nice.  First phone I've had that actually reads me my SMS over the Bluetooth in my car and lets me reply with speaking.  Live tiles are pretty cool and the Facebook integration works pretty well without even needing Facebook.  They did a good job on the animations and talking Caller ID options too compared to other offerings.  All the ports and buttons are right where they need to be too.The apps may be limited, but it has what I need and I can develop more. Netflix plays well and loud with the speaker too.  It actually has 100% working IMAP Email which my Motorola Android devices didn't. (Only complaint is it puts deleted emails in a new Deleted Items folder instead of using Trash, but it works so no complaints)  I was also able to sync with my Google account and link Contacts, Calendars, Emails, etc.  There is also built in phone locating via GPS or remote ringing, plus remote wipe/kill.  While Android and iPhone are suing each other, Microsoft is going to take over.  I was originally disappointed with the way they ditched Win Mobile, but they did good with the replacement.  When updating it identifies the device as a Zune Win Mobile device too, so it appears it is nothing more than Win Mobile running Silverlight.

If you like to do tweaking all the time and put up with issues or things not working get an Android.  If you want a phone that works one way, has no options or customization, plenty of apps, and no keyboard get an iPhone (They are actually the same size of screen, so the Quantum is like an iPhone with keyboard and options).", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "crap", "Author": "MaraRae21", "ReviewID": "R3CWDFS53A261D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it didnt even work  was just stuck frozen on the first scrren during start up and seller is very hard to get ahold of.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Techomaniac", "ReviewID": "RQHBTQZS5UZ6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received the product on time.

I charged up the battery on the Quantum, turned it on, and after initial setup was good to go, no problems whatsoever.After a day of working with it to get familiar, I can safely say that the Quantum is a vast improvement over the Thrive, at least for me. It's not cutting edge, by any means, but it's faster and more robust by far than what I had.I'm quite happy with the move from Android 2.2 to WP7.5; the phone is responsive, the screen is sharp, and the hardware keyboard is the best I have used at any price on any phone. It synchronized my Google, Facebook, and SkyDrive, and the Windows Phone Marketplace has enough apps available at this point to make it very useful social and casual entertainment resource, as well as good phone. The XBox Music/XBox Live/Zune integration is an interesting counterpoint to the Apple App Store-iTunes/Google Play offerings; I'm surprised that Microsoft hasn't gotten more marketing traction out of that.All in all, I'm very pleased.

I'm with Consumer Cellular so I was worried if everything would function properly, but since they are on AT&T;'s network I was hopeful. Well the problem started when I tried to sync Outlook - it does NOT work. After a little investigating I discovered it will never work unless I purchase a program or app. (Some sort of cloud combo thing with Windows Live. Idk, too confusing) Absurd I thought, this is a Windows phone, Outlook is a Windows program! How can it not function?! Really stupid. BUT, I figured out I could go into the Outlook webmail via my service providers network and forward my email to my Hotmail acct. Now all my work email goes to my Hotmail acct, problem solved but annoying having double emails.Next problem I came across - equally as big - NO Data Connection on the 3G network! One of my main criteria in a smart phone was having a GPS capability, now what?! I dug and dug for many days on the internet, called my phone carrier (several times), called LG (several times), called the amazon seller - no help at all. In fact Consumer Cellular kept blaming LG, and LG kept blaming CC - so frustrating. Well I was just about to give up and start the return process with amazon when I decided to do one more internet search session. I came across this forum and tried again what someone had done with the same issue.  You have to go into MFG menu (there are a lot of other setting options in there that LG didn't even tell me about) and change the SDA setting to enable.I still can't get the MMS to work so no picture sending, but I figure I can just do that via email or facebook. Another work around that's annoying, but not a big deal to me but I know it is a big deal for some. I also agree the apps selection is not great, but again not a big deal for me. Also agree the on/off button and volume button are awkward, as well as the tiny function and shift key on the qwerty board. The Qwerty was a must for me and is almost too roomy at first, but I'm used to it now. So because it's roomy, why are the function/shift keys so tiny? The camera is nice, with a flash to boot.So for now I am satisfied with all this phone has to offer, but wish it wasn't so stressful and time consuming to make it all work correctly for me.*After having this phone for a couple months now I've decided I'm really annoyed with this phone, too many things that should work better/easier.

I know this because after a month of using it, my battery went completely dead! (Luckily), At&t; had taken the phone but told me that the phone had made 2,600 calls, sent 12,000 text messages, and that the battery was more than 2 years old!

Its important to follow this procedure because its an AT&T; phone and would not update from the Zune software to the most recent Windows Operating System. Apparently, AT&T; stopped at a certain point with the updates; probably because they wanted to sell the new W8 phones. Just jump on the web and place a search for a YouTube video update of the LG Quantum C/900 to Windows OS 7.8. The video shows how to set up the phone to prepare it for the update. Then you simply connect it to your Zune software and go to 'Phone' then 'check for updates.' It took about an hour to update but the change was amazing. Brighter colors, bug repairs, the ability to change tiles to smaller sizes, new icons, etc. I like the slide out Qwerty which is backlit by the way so one can text in the dark, and it also has the digital keys for those who prefer it.

I contacted the seller who told me that the phone is \"GUARANTEED\" to be unlocked. It isn't. I was planning on using SIMple Mobile SIM card for this phone and canceling my AT&T; plan. However, the SIMple card wouldn't work, and I have been forced to continue with AT&T; for the time being.Seller, can I please have the UNLOCK CODE?!Secondly, this phone is so buggy. After connecting to Zune on my computer and waiting over an hour for the Mango update to install, it didn't fix all the issues.The most annoying of the various bugs, which seems to be the phone itself, not the OS, is that the touch screen will freeze and become completely unresponsive. You can't power the phone down to reset it, because in order to do so you have to simultaneously hold down on the power button and swipe the screen down..but if the screen is frozen you can't do that, so the only way to fix it is to take your phone case off, pry off the back of the phone (which is a PAIN IN THE BUTT. Ladies, I hope you don't value your fingernails, because you'll lose them trying to take this phone apart.) and remove the battery.This happens to me at least twice a week.This phone is really heavy.

For US usage look elsewhere", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3FNBGO0D9K11X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update 5/20/12I've now had this phone for over a year. I've purchased at least three of them for friends in Africa. And I had to replace mine after I lost one in Uganda. I'm currently in Ghana and this phone continues to amaze me as a world phone. My Droid 3 is helpless outside the US because Verizon has disabled data access if you don't have their SIM card in the phone which means a huge data bill. But this LG Quantum really works well as a world phone. I get 3G data using just airtime credits with MTN in Uganda and Ghana whereas I have to pay for a data bundle with other cell carriers in these countries. The battery lasts over 2 days with moderate usage and switching between WiFi in the hotel to 3G on the road. My new Sony Ericsson Experia Arc S is a great Android world phone. Except I have to pay for a data bundle. The Quantum has a much smaller screen so I use the Experia for reading digital library books and listening to music. But the Quantum gives me fast Internet access. So it has it's place. I have my own ringtones in each phone. In my Quantum I use a Bob Marley tune. He's hugely popular in Africa. Use Dropbox to set up a Ringtones folder that will be synced to your phone. Create a ringtone on your PC and drop it in the Dropbox Ringtones folder. It will appear on the Quantum if you have Dropbox installed. Then choose it as your ringtone. Mango is a solid operating system. I've had no trouble with crashes with Mango. And Windows Phone 7 has a good variety of apps. Some are better on Windows 7. Some are better on Android. But you can do just about anything you need on both operating systems. The slide out keyboard on the Droid 3 is better than on the Quantum mainly because of the larger size. But they are both better than having to use a screen keyboard if you're a touch typist. Another plus for the Quantum is the price has dropped so low now you can afford to take it traveling and not worry too much about a huge loss if you lose it in the bush like I did.For a versatile phone in the US pick something else. But for a world phone the Quantum is still a contender and quite a bargain at current prices.------------------------------------------------------------I've had my LG Quantum since April 2011 when I purchased it for trips to Africa. It's worked well in Uganda where the MTN Uganda SIM card gives you 3G without having to pay for a data plan. You just buy airtime cards. Mali doesn't give you 3G at all. In the US the Quantum is just an OK cell phone. I get anywhere from 8 hours to a day and a half on the battery with little to no usage. I believe it's because the AT&T; signal is non-existent in my home so the AT&T; shop gave me a MicroCell to use. Going in and out of the house where the phone has to switch between regular cell and MicroCell seems to nail the battery. Also the wireless signal is weak at the far end of our house where my office is. A weak wireless signal also seems to cause the phone to use excess battery. At times the phone will heat up very hot and consume huge amounts of battery. I have three different LG OEM batteries. And they all behave the same. This is my second LG Quantum since I lost my first one in Africa. Both phones have the same heating and excessive battery use problem. Right now in the US I've removed the SIM card and switched my AT&T; service to another phone. With the SIM card removed and with the phone on but not being used it lasts for nearly two weeks on standby. So the problem seems to be with how the phone manages varying cellular and wireless signals.I now have a Motorola Droid 3 GSM world phone. It is light years ahead of this Windows 7 phone. The Droid 3 also has the slider keyboard. There's no need for the awful Microsoft Zune program for transferring photos and files from and to the phone from the Droid 3. Hook up the Droid 3 to my laptop via USB and it's just another SD card. Or transfer photos or files via wireless to any computer on my home wireless network using the ES File Explorer app. Transferring photos taken on the phone can be a big issue if you use the phone camera for those spur of the moment candid shots like I do. It was painful to set up file transfer with the Windows 7 phone. And I've done it for 4 different Quantum phones. It doesn't get any easier with practice. The LG Quantum camera takes good quality photos in full daylight (forget night photos). But if you don't have your laptop handy to connect with Zune you can't transfer the photos off the phone. At full high resolution the photos are much too big to email. When I lost my first phone it's the photos I lost. Everything else was safe in the Google cloud and in Dropbox. With my Droid 3 I can transfer the photos at any time to either or both my Android Toshiba Thrive tablet and my Windows 7 laptop either via wireless or using a USB cable.This LG Quantum doesn't handle a weak phone or wireless signal well. My Droid 3 functions perfectly in such places where I got no signal on the Quantum. Besides requiring the Zune software the Windows 7 phone for any transfer of photos, music, or files it can't be used as a wireless hotspot. If you have a wireless-only tablet that's a big issue. The Droid 3 works seamlessly as a hotspot. It's included in the basic Android 3.2 software.For a first smartphone the LG Quantum may be a so-so choice. But it's got a lot of problems. If any of these problems might impact your cell phone usage you might want to keep looking.  There are newer phones that might offer a better experience.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Please don't buy it", "Author": "Haitham", "ReviewID": "R1Y10R5WXCXON3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The worst mobile ever, and it is not new as mentionedit comes with a chines loose back cover (not its original cover), a strange kind of battery ( not the original one), strange packaging even the mobile is not fitting inside the package, and it is locked and has this loop of Bin and Puk code", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointed!", "Author": "WestTXLee", "ReviewID": "R1UKAW3DD70F4K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Wanted this phone because it seemed to be the best combination of smart phone with slide out keyboard.

However, all I could do was actual calling: no texting or internet.  I loved the heft of the phone and I liked some of its features. It was my first experience with a Windows Phone and I think I would have loved it if I could have gotten it to work. However, I never could get to a menu to change the MMS/SMS settings.  So after hours and hours of searching online trying to figure out how to utilize all the features, I'm sending it back.  My phone seemed to be new, as described.  It arrived in a timely fashion, great condition- but the menu was in Italian.  The customer service at LG talked me through getting it switched to English, but there were still some things that were always in Italian.  That somewhat annoyed me but wouldn't have caused me to send it back had I been able to use all the features.

Oh boy.I never have bars or reception when I know I should. My husband can have 4 bars and I breathed too hard and am in Emergency Only mode. More often than not, I can't connect. I have to constantly reset it (I just go into airplane mode, switch it on and off, then I can normally connect). Because of this always being in emergency only mode, I've missed calls from work, interview opportunities, calls from people watching my child, etc. Since I'm not checking to see if I have reception every second, I won't even know I've missed a call till hours later. When you have an infant in someone else's care? THAT'S BAD.I constantly have to turn the phone off to get things to work. My email won't connect? Reset, delete the account, re-add, then wait 3 days for it to fix itself.It freezes. A lot.Limited games available. Want that game everyone has? You can't even PAY for it. The game simply isn't available for your phone.Love to Facebook? Have fun. The app for the phone never loads. I ended up using the internet function and leaving it up, which is a pain in my patoody because I have to re-size constantly. Even then, it gives me \"Page not Available, Retry?\" and I have to hit retry 5-10 times till it loads. Wow, that was worth it to look at a picture. Can't just hit the back button, have to find the original home link in your history, have the page not be available and hit retry another 8 times and you get back to the main page.I gave it 2 stars because the camera. No really, that's what I used it for. Know those commercials where your phone does everything but call? That's this phone. I have an app to learn sign language, it will track my workout, and I can play Solitaire when bored. But you want to call? Email? Facebook? Psh. It doesn't do that.
