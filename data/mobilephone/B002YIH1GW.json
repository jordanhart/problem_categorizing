It also works with AT&T; with no problem.Physically, the phone is light, smaller than it appears, and the battery seems to be fine, although I don't talk a lot on my phone.  The Camera works well in either landscape or portrait mode, and the camera app fast and works fine.Here's the stuff that isn't so great:1) While the phone supports bluetooth, it only appears to support very basic profiles, so it doesn't look like you can transfer pictures, addresses, and data with your computer which is a significant drawback2) I was very disappointed to realize it doesn't support a normal headphone.  Instead, it has a weird proprietary headphone jack, and the headphones supplied are about the lowest quality3) The FM radio is great except that it won't play the FM radio without the headphones attached.  But here's the weird part, once the headphone is attached you can play it through the speaker.  You can't make this stuff up.4) No WiFi, which means data access will always cost you money through your carrier.I would buy it again.  The screen quality and size make it worth $100.

Hahn", "ReviewID": "R31LXLDS9TWYD9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought two of these and my husband and I both wish we had different phones.  They feel kind of cheap, they are very lightweight.  I think the most annoying thing about them is that the picture messaging does not work (I know you run that risk with unlocked phones) and that when you are on a call in your voicemail you have to push the call button to get out of the screen and then the back button to return to the screen to pull up the keypad to delete or save the message you just listened to.  The bottom of the screen shows a keypad button for you to touch but you can't do so unless you go back and forth.  More than once in going back and forth I have initiated a second call to voicemail (because I have to push the call button to go forward).  It becomes very annoying.  Also when you turn off the phone it resets everything in the phone.  If you have customized your toolbar that pulls out from the side of the screen it is reset, all your alarms are reset including the call volume.  Twice I have had the volume reset itself on the alarm and I have turned the alarm on the night before and had it go off in the morning (at volume 1) and then not woken up.  The alarm does not continue to go off until you shut it off it just stops on its own so if you miss it the first time you are out of luck.  There are many little quirks with this phone that I just don't like.  My husband had his in his pocket at the beach and he was standing in the water and a wave got him somewhat wet.  Not soaking wet, just damp.  The phone stopped working.  I took it apart and the little water tabs that turn red when it gets wet were not even wet enough to turn red.  There was no visible water in the phone, yet it won't turn on.  I dropped my LG in a glass of water, totally submerged, and I dried it out and continued to use it for another year.  This phone is just not well made and the little quirks are annoying.  We will both be getting new phones.UPDATE:  Do NOT buy this phone.  I contacted Amazon on the one that died and they directed me to the manufacturer and gave me Samsung's number.  I called and Samsung informed me that this phone was manufactured in the UK and that I would have to call overseas to the UK to report the problem to them and have them help me.  Why is that if this is the US version as Amazon advertises it???

I'm sure there are but I didn't want to spend more than around $100 plus I only use my phone for calls and texting and not for the internet.  I particularly wanted a very light weight phone and this certainly fits the bill.  Unlike some other reviewers, I find the battery life very acceptable.  My phone is on standby from 9am until 10pm every day and I typically talk on the phone an average of 30 minutes a day.  I find that the battery lasts about 5 to 6 days before needing a recharge.  The only thing that disappoints me is that the touchscreen sometimes needs to be pressed 2 or 3 times before it will accept your command. (Others mentioned this).  The funny thing is that when touching the numbers on the keypad or the letters for texting, it works flawlessly first time but other things sometimes need a little more work.

When I first got it, I went through hell setting up the settings in order to send picture messages (like someone else said, it is an international phone).

I would touch an option, and it wouldn't go so I would tap it again, and suddenly like it realized I'm doing something it registered both of the taps.

The screen doesn't flip to fit the way you're holding the phone.The features are very basic, something I've found with all of my Samsung phones (it's my third Samsung phone, and is surely my last). Customization is extremely limited. You can't change much about the screen, or even the ring tones (e.g. the keystroke sound can't be turned off, merely silenced). It has very few ring tones.The camera is pretty poor.The internal software is disastrous. Compared, e,.g., to the Blackberry's, it's clunky and needlessly complicated.

Also, I found that it's prone to scratches, making the screen very diffucult to see in direct light.Another problem I found is bad build quality. It's not the worst I've ever come across, but is certainly far from the best. The phone feels very light, but at the same time very cheap and plasticy.

The charger is for Europe and can be charged with its included USB cable, but what a pain in the butt. The phone has no keys so when you call any automated company, good luck trying to get a keypad to come up and enter the expected information.  I use the KEY button on the side to bring up choices while on the phone, but still is no fun. The other problem is if you are putting the phone to your ear and face and need to be hands free,  well you cut off your phone call due to the bottom front buttons ending the call.its lightweight, and one drop I would guess will have you hoping it is under the manufacturer's warranty.  So go for the extended warranty.Everything is fairly EZ to figure out, it comes with a CD but certainly doesn't answer simple setups.  This is not a keeper for those thinking they will have an EZ phone to use ...I am not crazy about my new phone and for valid reason.If you have no computer to recharge your USB to computer ,  well, you will be more upset with your new toy, til you get the USA adapter to charge this questionable phone.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect for what i need", "Author": "jessicaw", "ReviewID": "R1AQUFNDQHMZID", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone for what i need.

Tried different settings, but it appeared to never receive the 'no more messages' signal to clear the indicator.  2) Like the widgets and being able to customize the screens.  The bad thing about it was that they were never 'fixed' on the screen.  So every time you scroll between the 3 available screens, if you happened to touch a widget, it would move - sometimes off the screen.  Was not very easy to move between screens and not touch a widget.  Surprised that they overlooked this in their design.The touchscreen was pretty responsive, but texting was not as easy as I thought it would be.

I was informed that this was a UK phone and support would have to be sought there, because they had NO information about it in their database.

Plus the features it has aren't really all that great. :\\", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love my new phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"mad max\"", "ReviewID": "R2M5O54S6XT529", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Never thought I would like a touch screen phone but I find that I am completely in love with my new phone.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "samsung cell phone", "Author": "shopper", "ReviewID": "R3BC6H8UBFDYJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I RECEIVED THIS CELL PHONE IT WAS EVERYTHING THE SELLER MENTIONED AND MORE I LOVE THIS CELL COMPACT, LIGHT, USER FRIENDLY FOR OLD FOLKS LIKE ME I RECOMMEND IT.

I Wish if there was a speaker button to turn the speaker on without the too many steps to get the speaker on.

First, it is not a U.S. version.  Came with default language in Spanish, and it took time to get it into English.  Did not come with a 1 gb micro card as described in the listing. There is no real user manual, only on the cd, and it really isn't very clear on functions and difficult to download onto Windows 7. Cant say how good phone is until I get a micro card. My AT&T; sim card had the phone up and running in no time.  Overall, phone seems to be OK, but Amazon dropped the ball on what you're getting by their item description.
