It cost me 3 Months (and counting) to contacting multiple sources including the Seller, Samsung, AT&T;, and T-Mobile, dozens of email conversations, time and energy trying to return a defective item to the Seller that I didn't know it was defective until 5 Months later this phone doesn't register to network at all. If you are patient enough, please read on. I think it would be beneficial for inexperienced online shoppers looking for unlocked smartphone. I sincerely hope they won't make the same mistake I have made.Last November I purchased an unlocked Samsung Galaxy S3 T999 from Wireless Experts Inc. on Amazon, at $564. Seller said this phone is unlocked and works with GSM carriers.That phone was shipped to me with nice factory packaging, and it was working as expected. However 5 Months later, on May 5th, it can't register to network anymore. I tried everything I could but somehow my SIM card works on other GSM phones but their card won't work on mine phone. I contacted seller and they told me it has passed 90 days and there is no way I could return it to them. Seller suggested I contact Samsung for solution. Samsung replied and agreed to repair my phone. I shipped this S3 to Samsung in TX and they diagnosed and changed parts related to signal reception, and shipped the phone back to me.After putting my SIM card back and switched it on, this phone still not register to network.My friend told me my phone may be blacklisted by carrier. I submitted IMEI number to T-Mobile, and T-Mobile says this phone was reported lost and blocked from registering networks.Here comes the email communications, counts up to 43, summarized as follows:1. I contacted Wireless Experts Inc. that this phone was reported stolen. I want to return this phone to them and get my money back.2. Seller said it still may work with AT&T; and asked me to try an AT&T; SIM card.3. I insist it was seller's fault to sell me a stolen phone that is blocked by carrier 5 Months later.4. Seller said a stolen phone is USUALLY reported lost in 90 DAYS, 5 MONTHS seems ABNORMALLY LONG to him.5. I said REALLY I didn't knowing this phone was defective, or I would definitely return it in that so called 90 DAYS.6. Seller said he would ask his supervisor.7. After long waiting, the Seller said he will refund me $200 for returning this item to him, after 3 months contacting him.SUMMARY and LESSON LEARNED:1. Checking IMEI after you bought an unlocked smartphone won't work since it might be reported after months of usage.2. Even if you received a factory sealed new phone, looks just from \"factory\" rather than another person, it still might be reported as stolen.****UPDATE on Aug 9th, 2013****This long lasting case was closed, when seller agreed to 1. refund $200 for this phone WHILE I can keep it, in addiction, 2. refund $400 AND return this phone to him if it doesn't work with other carriers that haven't banned this phone yet. Both parties are OK with this result.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Product Misrepresentation", "Author": "be careful", "ReviewID": "R2IY92PPXW90OO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The title said unlocked phone but in description, it said not unlocked.
