The phone performs well enough but is a bit slow. Runs great on T-Mobile and you can get a no contract unlimited text and data (100 min talk time) for $30/month at Wal-Mart.You can't load it with a lot of apps because of the limited memory. Pick the apps you need the most! This is a good choice for a Blackberry replacement business phone with Android. Keyboard is a little cramped, but I got used to it in a couple of days.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Spice is Nice", "Author": "Shannon", "ReviewID": "R3SBMWA0TYG7XT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is really nice to look at the features are easy to use and overall I am happy with the product.

It is a knock off, I know from ample experience with the knock off cell phones from China. The screen looks and feels cheap, the objects and picture are not sharp, looks like the phone software was copied from somewhere. And I am sure the hardware is a knock off so it will last maybe 1 month before all kinds of breakdown. Not sure if there is an original or if it is the way this phone is from Motorola,  but certainly what I got was a \"copy\"...a bad looking copy.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone for 99$ bucks", "Author": "D.M.", "ReviewID": "R2SHH2H19TDVNP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i just bought this movil phone and i think is a good phone for people who is entering in the android ambient, besides of the cheap price that i pay wich was the number one reason that i bought this is also the fact that this phone comes with android version 2.3, thats right, not with the oldest 2.1 - update 1, the procesor is quite fast and is powered with an adreno 200 so you can run some good games but don't expect to run shadowgun or some other recent games because it can't, besides of that is a good phone as i said up to entry in the android world.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "The phone died after 4 months Only", "Author": "cecilia", "ReviewID": "R2D187FXVYTLGX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone and used Only 4 months, and the phone won't turn on???

Since before buying, I like to research a product well. All reviews and stuff seemed OK for the phone so I bought it. The thing is that the phone isn't as fast as I thought it would be, and its internal memory just blows...mine's got merely 150 MB of internal storage, so it's an awful phone if you're into downloading lots of android apps.Another mayor flaw (at least for me) is that the phone resets every once in a while all by itself when not in use as well as when I was talking with it. The worst part was restarting...it takes the phone pretty looooong to completely load all contacts and stuff and since it restarted by itself in the middle of a conversation, you have to redial the person and wait every command for a while for the phone to react since it's loading.This phone is too slow for me and what completely ruins this phone is the miserable 150 MB of internal memory.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfect", "Author": "Glicelda Ramos", "ReviewID": "R2V8Q502LQQCNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got what I expected and more, It has very nice features.
