I wear reading glasses.  I want to check my email, want to look up a street address or phone number while out running errands, I may check the weather while I am out, may check the stock market...but I don't want a TOUCH phone.  I don't want a SMART phone. I don't WANT APPS!  I save most of my work for when I am on my home computer.  My phone is not attached to my hip! And I don't have time to play mindless pointless games!But I--like most incredibly busy moms--do text like crazy.  Don't call me, is my motto, text me.  So I do want to be able to see the letters without using a magnifying glass.  I do want a keypad where all the letters are NOT scrunched up right next to one another.  NO I don't want a Jitter Bug.  I am not 80.  yes I want a decent phone and video camera.  My kids are teens.  I don't want to miss those moments when we don't have our camera with us.I am amazed at how few phones are out there for people who aren't interested in all this other stuff.I am a Sprint customer and when I decided to try once again to find a phone that better suited my needs I was extremely disappointed that I had a choice of 2.  Whoopee.  I had considered the Innuendo last time but the reviews were so poor I just went right over it.This time I dug into the reviews a little and realized, OMgosh...these bad reviews are written by people who want the Smart everything under the sun phones.  Once again I find that what I want is the opposite of what everyone else wants.I ordered.  I got.  I love this Innuendo.When I have more time I will sign back in and tell you why.For now, I just have to ask the phone companies, with the aging population statistics as they are--which is telling all of us that the over 50 market is about to expand dramatically, why aren't you designing goods and services for us!?", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone, these reviews are ludicrous.", "Author": "Jacob West", "ReviewID": "R82LBS5LMSBLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My friend has recently purchased this phone after I told him how great boost mobile was (at least in my area). He got this exact model phone for a little bit more than what I'm seeing it on Amazon for but the quality of this phone blew me away. The first time he called me I thought he was calling me from his house phone because of how unbelievably clear it was. Yes, at first I thought even though it was an expensive phone there is no way it could have quality equivalent to a phone available to sprint, version, or any of the other more popular cell phone companies customers. I was wrong, very very wrong, the phone was just as good as any other provided by the pre mentioned phone companies.I started to use the phone, and the FIRST thing I noticed was how accurate the touch screen on the front of the phone was. The buttons on the inside of the phone also felt amazingly comfortable.For the people complaining about it smudging...what do you expect? Don't complain about trivial things and write bad reviews about good products because you're too lazy to clean you're phone up. A lot of people think that cell phones should be able to survive being tossed across a room, hit a wall, fall into a toilet and still function.Overall it's a great phone, if you're expecting it to replace your smartphone then yes, you'll be disappointed. It is what it is, a good sound quality, flip phone with a text keyboard with a good facebook app. If you were looking for more, then why did you go to boost? Boost is for those who can't afford (or don't need) a phone with millions of apps and a better (while still terrible) camera. If you're mad because your Boost phone isn't the next ground breaking thing in your life, you probably shouldn't own a phone...or be driving... *coughs*", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Down Grade from Sanyo Incognito", "Author": "Michael W.

I like that the earphone door and adapter door fit nicely in place every time.The camera is nice does really well without a flash.Ok now for my dislikes, the keyguard button doesn't work, so I tend to hang up on people when i hold the phone to my face.  I usually us a hands free device and keep the phone in my pocket, still hangs up on people.  It's frustrating I had the sanyo incognito before this one, and the keyguard feature worked great, so I am not sure what they did on this phone to screw it up but it is.Also the back light tends to go out and not come back on sometimes, even when it's fully charged.And when I was using the telenav program the phone cut off quite a few times.  which sucked because I was out of town and really needed the turn by turn navigation to work.My Husband also has the phone and his tends to freeze alot.  Although he says he is not ready to throw in the towel, just yet.I think they had a great idea with this phone, I like the clamshell style the size Love the qwerty keyboard and it's ease of use.  I just wish it worked better.taking it back to bestbuy tomorrow going to try the Samsung Galaxy Prevail. Wish me luck!", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "This Phone is Great!! I like it a Lot!!! MetroPOS, Eat yo heart Out!!!!!", "Author": "Linus Oakerie", "ReviewID": "R3TJ6U9TPNHZQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing some exhausting research and evaluations of the many cell phones and wireless prepaid providers out there, and there are scores of them, I just happened to see this phone amongst the many featured on Boost Mobile's website!!Since I had already made up my mind that I was leaving MetroPCS anyway, I also looked into other options for a reliable prepaid cell phone service provider. So I decided to go with Boost Mobile, and the phone that I decided to get was the Sanyo Innuendo, an updated and revised version of the Sanyo Incognito.This phone is just loaded with the very latest in ultra-modern conveniences!! So, it's not a smart or android phone, but you'd almost think it is because of the many features that it has!! Android and smart phones have features jacked up to the moon, but all those features can also astronomically rob the phones of their memory, which in turn, can also eat up battery power almost in record time, causing you to have to recharge the battery far too often - more often then you'd probably want to!!The Sanyo Innuendo is a 3G phone, and it is more kinder to the battery, making it the ideal phone for holding more battery power, so that you don't have to recharge it as often. It gets at least about 1-1/2 days of use before the battery has to be recharged again.Ok, on to the features. It has;3G format.3.2 megapixal camera / camcorder.Full internal qwerty keyboard. Unit flips open to reveal keyboard, screen and other features.External 10-key front touch screen for dialing phone numbers as well as to view contacts, activity history, etc..After about 8 seconds, touch screen display will disappear and go into the Screen Saver mode. A small button on the top back left brings it back or puts the display back into the screen saver mode.2.8\" internal display screen.GPS navigational system for travel and locating street addresses.MP music player.Full messaging capabilities.Full Internet access for surfing the Web.Personal e-mail access (at no extra cost with Boost Mobile).Rubberized back.This cellular phone really gives you more bang for the buck!! It really makes cell phone communications so simple & enjoyable!! Using it has never been easier!! Talk up to 4.5 hours with friends & family! Standby time may vary from one period to the next. Text as often as you like!!So far, I love this phone!! It is the best one that I've owned! The best to come along in years! I haven't taken advantage of all of the features yet, but I will in due time. The phone looks kind of like a tiny laptop computer when open, and looks like a small Bible when closed.And now, for those of you who wrote your reviews to complain;As Jacob pointed out, this really isn't a bad phone. Seems that you wrote about more things to complain about. Of course the phone's external screen is going to get smudges on it, but it's YOUR job to try to keep it clean when it does!It might have a lot of features, but a self-cleaning screen is NOT one of them! Get over it, or spend the rest of your life looking for one that HAS this far-fetched feature. Stop knit-picking at it over minor things.Just try to appreciate the phone for all of the other things that it does.I also like Boost Mobile!I think that they have a much better plan than MetroPCS. Because their Shrinkage Plan eventually helps you save some money in the long run by deducting $5 from your monthly bill 3 times over an 18-month period!! No other prepaid wireless provider has that feature!!!  Plus, I called Boost Mobile and had that aggravating voicemail feature disabled - two of the things that Metro does not and will not offer.MetroPCS wants to charge members for every little thing!! They are nothinjg but a cash cow!!!Yes, I'm truly a very happy camper with Boost Mobile!!!!!", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Innuendo Crescendo!", "Author": "P.

I don't understand why people are giving bad reviews on this phone. The phone's features are very good. The keyboard feedbacks are good. The touchscreen is sensitive enough and the inside screen is the best featurephone screen, bar none. People complain of sluggishness, freezing up and slow web surfing. First of all, this is a feature phone, not a substitute for smartphones. It is for texting and talking, which are the core features of this device. This is the nicest non-smartphone of all the featurephones on Boost, Virgin, MetroPCS or any other prepaid carriers. People are taking things for granted.

Like the shrinkage plan a lot too.My phone came preloaded with navigation, quick methods to get to my favorite websites, email, simple version of facebook, etc.The speed of the phone surprised me. As you can see, I really like the phone. It is what it is, right? It is no iphone or android, but it's more than enough. Initially I was sad when I sold my Android, but learning to get around this phone has been a fun journey. Glad to be saving over $600 a year.I added my sd card from android, and pulled off a few pictures to make the phone more personal.Hopefully will find a way to transfer a couple ringtones, but not a big deal.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Rev charlie grear", "ReviewID": "RBJ04HRLA6M2P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Woooooooooow what a phone !

Overall not the best phone but not the worst phone. If you are looking for a phone to internet surf this is NOT the phone. The front touch screen presses buttons while you are on the phone talking to people. You wont hear it but they will. The facebook app is good. Depending on the youtube video you can watch some.(no actual music videos but like the videos where people upload pictures with songs). I love the camera and camcorder. The keyboard is also great. The keys are a nice size and it makes for easy texting. I also like the email app. The GPS on the phone is also handy especially if your lost. It basically depends on what your phone needs are.

But the truth is, that the Innuendo is a solid phone with some nice features and design, but both of these things are somewhat poorly executed.  Here's my list of likes and dislikes and what I can live with for the phone:LIKES:1.  Love the size.  I can put it in any pocket.  At work I have lots of stuff in my pockets to do my job so I can't have something the size of my wallet in each pocket.  The Innuendo is slim and compact.  Easy to carry around and handle.2.  It's tough and protected.  The main screen is protected and the outside shell of the phone is fairly tough.  Dropping it from a decent height will not phase this thing.  Again, this is great for my job.3.  The keyboard w/flip screen.  OH...if they only made affordable Androids like this I'd be ALL OVER THAT.  This is probably my favorite feature.What's Ok:4.  Ok menu system.  Nothing great but not necessarily useful.  It's easy to get around on the thing and find what you need once you learn the phone a little bit.5.  Apps.  It comes with Facebook and Yahoo apps and a Boost 're-boost' app which can be useful if you're in a bind and can't pay online or at a store.  The default browser which is also used for Yahoo and Facebook sucks though. I just hate how you have to navigate that thing. Thankfully Opera made one and I downloaded it.  It has its faults (you can't minimize...you have to close out completely to access the phone) but you get what you pay for.  The GPS is ok as well but I've used it and it seems to be off by a bit.  Can be tricky if you want pinpoint accuracy from a GPS app.6.  Texting.  The texting can get annoying and intrusive.  It will pop up in the middle of what you're doing, say, if you're writing a text...THIS IS NOT for anyone who receives a TON of texts.  Thankfully, I don't so I'm ok with it, but it does get annoying sometimes.What I hate:7.  The front phone panel.  The front of this thing has issues when you're trying to dial a phone number, dismiss an alarm...etc. Sometimes you press a number or whatever, and it doesn't respond to it.  Very frustrating at times.  I think this has to do with the battery life which I'm getting to next.8.  The battery life is pretty poor.  I'm charging this thing constantly compared to my last phone which could last for 5 days or so.  This thing MIGHT last you two days...and that's if you don't use a lot of Apps, get a lot of calls, text constantly, etc.9.  The price and screen quality.  I think I paid a Benjamin at Target for it.  I read a review and some dude liked it a lot and it had most of the features I liked which I wanted.  However, now I would only pay HALF of that.  Fifty bucks is the most this thing is worth imo.  For starters, my screen came with one of those film coverings on it and it had this big bubble in the middle.  Turns out it wasn't the film covering.  When I finally removed it the screen is what actually had the big bubble in it.  I was not happy.  Also, just recently I got some dark line spots on my screen.  I don't think this is due to me dropping it...they just kind of showed up!10.  Multimedia.  I take some pictures and can't transfer them ANYWHERE.  I have a usb cable to connect to my computer and it just will not do it.  So basically, the camera on my phone is completely useless.  Not that I'm a photo/video junkie anyways, but dude, this stuff should be easy to use by now. PLUG AND PLAY, SANYO!  You should not have to google around to find some kind of program to transfer files from or get this thing to connect to a PC.  I didn't even bother to do that...I've had enough of trying to get crap like that to work with my last 3 phones.  Also, there's no sound/voice recorder which is REALLY REALLY lame.  I'll get a song or a beat in my head and open my phone to find...oh yeah, this thing doesn't have a voice recorder.  :-/Conclusion:While I feel like I sort of got ripped off to what I was thinking I paid for, I maybe got just a little less than what I paid for.  This is a decent phone for the price if you don't get one with the bubble defect like I had...but its workable and still does the job it needs to do which is why I give it 3 stars.  I don't...maybe 2 stars is more deserving now that I wrote this review.  I'm going with 3 though just because I like the keyboard, basic design, and flip screen so much.  I just wish it did a better job at...well, pretty much everything.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Innuendo is a downgrade for me.", "Author": "AA", "ReviewID": "R2IWLFAEMBSB0O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I used to have an old Boost Mobile Motorola i465 phone that was amazing at texting/calling. After using this phone for well over a year it was time to switch, because the device started to malfunction. The Innuendo has many features but, the phone began to fail me after a couple days of use. The screen would constantly freeze, so I'd have to take out the battery repeatedly every single day I've had it. The web browser is for the most part slow, ugly, and clunky, like most phones [with the exception of smart phones]. The touch screen interface is a complete joke, if more than anything it is extremely ANNOYING. More often than once have I hit a button when I get a new message and I've called more people then I care to say by accident. Not only that, but it's a bit annoying when the touch screen won't respond to me clicking end when I want the call to be over. The cell service will go from 3 bars to no service when I use it but I suggest IF YOU get this, be sure to have complete coverage in your area. The place I live in is spotty so dropped calls, etc are common, strangely the last Boost Mobile phone I had never had this problem. Also, when I try to text, I'm never able to send a message when i'm under 3 bars. Pictures take FOREVER to send, [Again, if you live in a high-coverage area this won't be much of a problem]. The only reason I bring this up is because my old phone used to send picture messages instantly, and comparing it to this one was a downgrade. I'm already planning on buying another phone, because this one hasn't even lasted me 4 months. I suggest you do your research and see if this is the right product for you. For the cost, it's not bad, but bare in mind that you need to be in a high-coverage area for this to be an okay phone. Don't buy this if you aren't. My old phone was under Boost Mobile and had the same coverage and yet calls NEVER dropped, they were excellent. Messages always sent. This phone was a COMPLETE downgrade for me.PROS: Wonderful keypad, works only if you live in a somewhat high coverage area [3-5 bars]CONS: Constant freezing, touch screen interface is more annoying than helpful, ugly and slow web browser, some apps take FOREVER to load, messages/pictures will not send sometimes.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Still holding strong.", "Author": "carmona", "ReviewID": "RTVQP60RS0A8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Brought this product a few years ago and I am just now doing a review.

I got the phone in blue and its size was also a plus, but that is where all the niceties end.The phone is not a smart phone, to be honest the phone part does not work all that well at all. The front screen is suppose to be touch activated if you can get the unlock feature to unlock in time to answer, and believe me you'll want the phone locked otherwise you are going to be dialing any and all on your contact list if its not locked and it is not comfortable feeling in my hand if I am trying to talk to another. The front screen's touch actions are not very accurate, meaning you can try punching a number and it will display the number next to it.The sound quality is middling at best and seems to cut in and out, as you attempt to talk to another person. For me you cannot get the volume loud enough to even hear if you are driving down the road. Also, forget looking at the screen portion in daylight, unless, like a vampire, you find shelter under some dark canopy or in a cave.My old phone was rock solid with signal strength and never went below 4 bars anywhere I was at with it. This thing seldom has 3 bars and just walking around my property it is continually beeping that it has lost signal with my tower just a half mile away.The camera produces very grainy images no matter how close up or far way an object is. The battery lasts about a day without talking, which is ironic, as that is the reason I got rid of my old flip phone, as it would no longer hold a charge more than a day. If you try to use the web features you are going to be frustrated by the lack of responsiveness even though it says it is 3G and it drains the battery even faster.The phone does seem to work well as a texting tool and it is suppose to have voice recognition, but I have tried setting it up 3 times and it still will not work.Overall, I am not happy with this phone and feel it was a step down from my old Motorola flip that I once enjoyed.

My then boyfriend had the Incognito in 2010 so I realized right away that the Innuendo is a more updated version.When I got the phone, and started playing around with it, I LOVED IT! I was happy to have a Boost phone where I could talk and text at the same time (and still receive messages). I liked the design and I bought a few cute cases for it to change up the look! My fave thing about it was the keyboard. I was happy to have a physical keyboard again (touchscreens give me the flux!). The camera wasn't too shabby. Call quality was fine (speaker as well). Only real issues I had were battery life and the phone freezing from multiple messages. Now I don't text as much anymore since my hubby and I got married (we live together now so no need to text constantly). Also what bothered me was not being able to have music ringtones. Myxer doesn't support this phone.I am currently about to get out of a contract with Sprint. I cannot afford a $200 cell phone bill. I have the HTC Evo Shift and have had to replace it 3 times ( which Sprint was a butt about doing). Only thing I'll miss about having a smart phone really is camera quality and the Android apps. I'm deciding to cut back on social networking and all the extra stuff anyway because it runs down phones, so I won't be using web on the Innuendo unless I need to.I'm going to switch back to Boost and have another round with the Innuendo!

This one connects to the internet and accesses a decent amount of web material. If it won't access something, I save the page and access from a computer later. Texting is great. I LOVE THE KEYBOARD! The camera is decent. (3.2MP) It doesn't have a lot of memory so I have to delete a lot of old pic messages and stuff on a regular basis. (or transfer them to a SD card) I'm not very tech savvy so this has been the right level of technology for me. It does have a few problems. It freezes and shuts itself off sometimes. It is annoying but not overly so. I've seen reviews of other Boostmobile phones do that so I'm not sure what's the problem. I can't speak for sound quality--i have hearing loss. The speaker phone worked for a while and I could do some basic things with it. Then I broke it--not sure if dropping it or getting wet ruined it =) The biggest thing that helped me WAS the navigation feature---then Boostmobile discontinued the service for this kind of phone. I had to buy a Android based phone (and external keyboard). OH one thing is i wasn't able to download games. It came with a demo but I couldn't download the game. It said the game wasn't compatible with the phone. If you want games, I wouldn't choose this one. It does work decently with web text based RPGs like torn city (torn.com)tho. Facebook works fine. I actually prefer the mobile version on this phone than being on a computer. Yahoo mail works fine. the messaging apps cost to use and I'm not impressed with them. The calendar is wonderful and can be set on the main screen. It has an ok amount of customization. It was enough for me.It has a series of \"tiles\" on the bottom of the screen. You can add and remove tiles and a few you can add links to features to access quicker than going thru the main menu. Anyway--I really like the phone. Over all the positives out weigh the few negatives it has. Unless you want a fancy phone that does a lot of internet stuff--this isn't the phone for you. Check FB, email, text, a few pics--this is all you need then get this phone!

I was on the road and discovered at 1 AM that there aren't any pay phones anymore.  So I asked where the nearest walmart was and picked the cheapest phone. $45 plus $20 for a reboost card. It was this phone.  Still couldn't make a call till morning cause you need either wifi  or a phone to activate it.  Why won't boost let me call them without activation? Why does mcdonalds/ATT shut off wifi at night? I planned to use pay by the minute as the Boost plan on my old phone was 5 cents a minute. Used half of my prepaid minutes setting up viocemail. ( I will be disabling it per a review here). Anyway I switched to unlimited monthly using my kindle fire at mcdonalds.  Switch by voice would take a day or two.I'm happy with the phone and set up autoreboost.  I had forgotten mycamera so I used the phone.  Finger over lens a lot at first and I found out why the $50price... had to buy a memory card after 20 photos.Short texts work fine.  I don't do long texts; never had it freeze.  Timeouts are adjustable.  When you use GPS you are in the car, right?  So plug the recharge in and set the option to keep backlight on always.I'm on the web right now to find out how to back up the calendar and contacts.  Under tools/memory you can copy that stuff to a file on the memory card.  Then attach to computer as a USB disk and save the file.  I hope to find a way to upload that file via the web browser.  And how to make it sync with calendar and to do list I haven't set up ongoogle or Yahoo or etc.  But right now I just want to avoid losing the data.The web browser is awful but it does work without wifi.  Kindle fire browser is much better if you are at mcdonalds or starbucks or etc. You can set home page away from boost.com.Outside keypad is invisible in bright sun have to find shade to use it.  And it takes getting used to. Aim a little above the symbol and feel for the vibration.  I like the qwerty button pad better than the kindle fire touchscreen keyboard.My battery life has been fine.  GPS works fine until you drive outside of sprint network and make a wrong turn.  It forgets all it knew about route, tries to contact server, and leaves you lost in the sticks.  That is the GPS software Providers fault.  Also at start of a reroute sequence it should not assume it k tows which way you are headed.  It should say drive north 0.5 miles not just drive 0.5 miles.Am writing this on Kindle fire and it is very hard to fix typos.

But the more I look at the two phones I see that the innuendo has more potential to be a modern phone between the more square design and the soft keys and how it feels in your hand its the the better buy hand to hand to the incognito which leads into if you want to buy the incognito as the prototype messaging phone for sprint and boost it has to be cheaper than the innuendo if not get the new and improved version. Parden the long paragraphs but the turn off for the incognito is the shape and sturdyness off the screens I mean you put enough pressure on the color screen that thing will fall apart on you but the innuendo is more sturdy in tearms of everything.hands on hands the innuendo has been the best constintly selling phone for boost and sprint.other than that thanks all you guys for listening to my review.

Now, that I used this phone, I was very disappointed. There were too many cons(i didn't all the cons-too many), phone needs a major overhaul. Save your money & get a botter phone. I dropped this phone on the highway going 60+mph, it still works. The outer screen doesn't work, its shattered; It's well-built. I WOULD NOT recommend this phone to anyone. It sucks, stay away.

This phone looks good (touch screen on the front) and the price is very good.  However, I would not reccommend it for long-term use.  I had problems sending text messages, the phone quality was very poor (It broke up alot), and the ringtones and other alerts volumes were not loud enough.  These r very important and very major things.  It was not the Boost service bc I have used Boost b4 (with a diff phone and it was great)I also didn't like the touch screen on the front bc when I would talk, my face would press keys and calls would get dropped or the ppl I spoke to wpuld hear touch tones.  I did like the fact that u could change alot of the settings--such as font size, font style and brightness and it has alot of ringtones to choose from.  The texting is good too.  I like the keyboard (open it to reveal that), u can insert preset smileys and emotions and add attachments, a subject line and a signiture.  The camera is good too.  I took pics without alot of light.  However, the pic I took would not send (I only tried twice).  But, in the end, I had to get a diff phone bc I could nor hear well on it and bc of the texting and loudness problems.  If u need a ok and cheap phone for the short term, I'd reccommend this one.  Bur as I said, I would not get it for long-term use.  I highly reccommend the LG Cosmos vn250 (num II) phone for Verizon.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Innuendo Failed", "Author": "Human Factor", "ReviewID": "R2ORMZ3GX2KANW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is phone is really bad.
