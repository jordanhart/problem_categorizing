I commute on my bicycle every day because I do not own a car or a motorcycle and wile riding my bike, was not able to hear or feel the cell phone attached to my belt ( and I even lost a phone that way ). But with this cool cell phone watch, I can take all of my calls with out missing one because it vibrates and have sound at same time and with the included bluetooth headset, it's totally great, great sound and grat voice clarity. And been alone, turn off the bluetooth headset and will be able to activate the loud speaker on and hear and speak with your caller just great, even the mp3's sounds quite loud.......I order the one with the 32g micro sd card and when I read the manual instructions it say's max reading of the device was 2g.. - NOT TRUE - it reads the 32g just fineNot quite yet, the only thing I didn't like was that with the bluetooth turned on, the battery last only 2 days, and with the bluetooth off, it'll last for more than 2 days...... the good thing is that you hook it up to your pc and it'll charge the battery in a matter of minutes, not hours but minutes..... watch my video review of this cell phone watch in action on youtube just type as follow SVP G13 WATCHPHONE VIDEO REVIEW OR follow the link......[...]see it in action, for me, it's just a great cellphone that works just fine and it's doing what it suposed to do ( make phone calls ).Leave every one else with the mouth open....... they will ask you where you get it - THEY WILL WANT ONE.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful, but with 2 major design problems...", "Author": "C. W. Sayre", "ReviewID": "R3UWZATG4U961I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic watch phone, and after using the G13 for the last few months, I can never go back to a regular cell phone.  The G13 is just too convenient, easy to use, always there, and so darn \"cool\".However, as shown in the picture I uploaded in Customer Images, the G13's plastic case has cracked through-and-through (on both sides of the watch), and this is after wearing it for 3 months -- a weak, poorly designed case.Another MAJOR issue is its TOTAL lack of water resistance.  \"Big deal\", you think, \"I'll just keep it out of the shower and the rain\". It's not that easy, because even the slightest perspiration, laden with corrosive salts, works its way quickly into the innards of the G13, damaging it over time.  And with the watch band and the case being made of plastic, you sweat under the watch quite a bit (at least in the Summer).I love this watch, but these two issues are so show-stopping that I'll probably have to purchase another brand of cell phone watch when mine falls apart or stops working, which looks like it will be pretty darn soon.UPDATE 1:I contacted Slim Sharp's (the vendor) customer service, described the above issues, and they were kind enough to replace the entire watch. So five stars for Slim Sharp's CS -- they stand behind their product!!UPDATE 2:New watch arrived from Slim Sharp.  This second G13 almost fell apart after one day of wearing it at the office.  QC must be a big problem in China...", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006595K8M"}}
