{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Premium phone that functions well.", "Author": "Sono", "ReviewID": "RWCZM94WZSZ96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a person who wants a few things from a phone.1. Does the basics well (call, receive, messaging)2. The equipment is quality (display, camera, speaker, gps, browser)3. Relatively modern without the expensive price. (I could care less about the latest edge in smartphones, anything that is outdated before its warranty ends should not be a heavy investment.)This phone fulfilled these challenges rather nicely.Description:This phone has a 4\" display, finished with a rounded aluminum backing in matte black. The bar that contains the android's back, home, and menu keys is transparent. The top of the phone has the 3.5mm jack. The bottom piece is a removable plastic cap. Removing it will expose a label that shows the serial/manufacturer info. The speakerphone is on the right side of the phone, below that is the power/unlock screen button, below that button is the volume adjustment, and ends with a 2-stage dedicated camera button. There is a front facing camera for skype and a rear facing 8mp camera (6mp when used in 16:9 widescreen) equipped with a bright LED flash. On the left side of the phone there is the micro-usb charging port, the micro hdmi ouput, the slot for microsim. The micro usb and hdmi ports are uncovered whereas the microsim port is covered. Comes with in-ear headphones w/ microphone as linked here Sony MH750 Stereo Headset with Microphone and Answer/End Button for Cell Phones - Black (Bulk Packaging) Factory unlocked with 1 year manufacturer warranty.The good:-Screen quality and brightness. Big and bright with 960x540 resolution. The indoor/outdoor visibility of the screen is just phenomenal. All the displayed text is legible and all the colors are only minimally washed out even in the southern California sunlight. At times, I use this phone in the dark and the backlight adjustment is just perfect. My eyes aren't strained at all when I do my 10-20 minute web browsing/Angry Birds session before I sleep. The screen is bright enough to be used outdoors and sensitive enough to be used indoors. As an added touch it comes with a screen protector applied by the factory.-The camera. It is quick to focus, flash, and take a picture. The camera key can be used to activate the camera when the phone is in sleep (have to really press down on it for .5s), and it can be set to whether the phone will take a picture directly or just focused. This camera wake-up option (called Quick Launch by Sony) can be disabled altogether.-Speaker phone quality. It's not tinny and sharp and its loud enough.-Cellphone reception. It's been good for me even on T-mobile even without 3G and the other bands as seen in the chart Amazon as provided. WiFi strength is reasonably strong.-Texting. 3 choices in keyboard layout, traditional T9 and 2 versions of QWERTY. There is a gesture function (dragging your finger across the letters of a word will automatically type the word), texting too quickly will activate this function so I turned it off. Auto-correct can be fully tamed. The voice-to-text works really well for me, I tried the tongue twister \"She sells sea shells by the sea shore\" and it worked for the most part. The only mistake that it made was instead of sea it inputted see. There are options of different language keyboards as well, English, Chinese, and Japanese.-Optimization of Android OS by Sony. Very quick to jump from menu to menu, app to app. Applies updates independently with just a WiFi source. Facebook integration works, Skype works depending on bandwith strength.-Overall quality and feel. Thin and well weighted. The touchscreen is very responsive asides from the trouble I have swiping across screens with 1 hand. The transparent bar's keys are very responsive. It is incredibly distinct with its design, unlike those other just rectangular bars with a big screen.-No software required to connect the Xperia P to a PC. It opens up the ~12gb of usable space like a flash drive, transfers files drag and drop style. There's an optional Xperia companion software, but I prefer the simplicity of dragging and dropping files.-Language options. The Xperia P comes loaded with 50+ languages including multiple dialects of English, Spanish, and Chinese. As a cruel joke someone can set the language to Basa Sunda, Galego, Shqipe, or Srpski.-The included in-ear headphones aren't the best but it's better than the cheap earbuds normally packaged with phones. The headphone's wire lacks a slider because it's the behind the neck style wire where the left bud's wire is 1/2 to 1/3 the length of the right bud.The bad:-Subpar battery life unless all battery saving apps are on. Leaving WiFi connected alone drained the battery in half over night. Turning on extended battery saving mode and energy saver mode on the display will double the battery life to about 2 days of moderate usage. I've managed to average 25% of battery usage daily by just sending/receiving texts with minimal WiFi usage.-Non-removable backplate and battery. Battery life estimations are exaggerated to say the least.-Battery gauge was finicky at first. I charged it at 20% and the battery gauge would stay at 20% even though I charged it for a full night. Restarting the phone would show 100%. This glitch is now gone after a week of usage.-No SD card expansion.-Auto-rotate isn't sensitive enough, I have to swing the phone around a bit if I'm laying down and texting.-Camera key is a little stiff. Focusing with the camera is easy, taking a snapshot takes quite a bit more effort.Update: 12/08/12-Be mindful of the proximity sensor on the phone or you'll end up hanging on whoever you're talking to. When your face is close enough to the phone, the screen will automatically lock however I'm used to using my shoulder to hold the phone against my face. The phone will go out of place and I'll end up hitting the End Call button really easily. Sony, if you're reading this, make the range on the proximity sensor go farther on future phones.-Restart the phone every couple of days because the apps will drain the phone's battery life even after closing them. I've forgotten to restart my phone after a busy week and I find the battery life being drained down to 65% overnight.-After a few months of usage, the phone isn't showing any signs of slowing down. I still love using this phone.Update: 4/26/13-Sony has finally delivered a 4.1 Jelly Bean update to the Xperia P. However this may have caused my phone to brick itself momentarily. One day, the OS just stopped being responsive so I restarted the phone, only to have to fail to initialize and get to the homepage. So I used sony's update software to hopefully just patch and update from ICS to Jellybean. This didn't work either so I had to reformat. I consequently lost all my contacts and apps installed but still kept everything in the storage part of the phone (music, photos, etc). Since this problem was an easy fix and accidents do happen I still recommend this phone. I am not sure if this is Android's fault or Sony's fault and if this proves to be persistent than I will assume it's Sony's fault and will update this review.-On the plus side, 4.1 Jelly Bean adds Google Now and has updated the overall look of the phone ie screen lock, icons, menu layout, color themes etc. There is now a 'Stamina Mode' which replaced 'Extended Battery Mode' to increase battery life, it now provides an estimate of the stand-by time remaining. Sony Walkman has also been updated to have an equalizer and xClarity which is an automatic equalizer.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Impressed!", "Author": "J. Fischer", "ReviewID": "R1JORXNL6MW4KU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think that it is important to state I have never owned a smartphone prior to this purchase. I never thought it practical to own one on the premise that I'd be stuck in a contract with some lousy company and spend $130 per month (college student/part-time work). Unlocked = no contract? Hell yeah. Tech awareness level: I OWN an ASUS g75V, 12 Gb RAM, nVidia GTX 670M, it's pretty cool but that's a different story, I emphasize own because I don't want you to think that I chisel designs in rocks for fun.Anyway, enough pre-review ramble there is plenty review ramble to kill a few minutes of your time. Sorry, non-refundable. Take it for what it's worth: If you want to skip the specifics of my review, go to the end and I will briefly restate the points made throughout in the last paragraph. Thanks :)The OS needs an update upon delivery. This is, apparently, important to do with ALL Android phones upon update: you must do a factory reset after you update your phone to 4.0 (ice cream sandwich), or else you will have APN issues, and certainly other software incompatibilities. This will mess with your multimedia message delivery and probably some other important things I can't fathom. Make sure you factory reset the phone before you do anything after the update, because you will inevitably reset it at one point and lose this info. Don't back up anything until you reset, unless you have rooted chances are you didn't remove the default APN t-mobile settings. (Trust me it is in this order.) In order to set the APN to your carrier, I think installing the micro SIM card, update the phone software through WiFi or internet, and a factory reset in that order would be the solution. (I run AT&T; and spent quite a bit of time trying to swap out of the t-mobile default before resetting.)Still no jellybean, which is version 4.1. Apparently it's an awesome OS, but the Xperia P will not have the ability to update to this version for a few months. Other 2012 models already have the capability of updating to jellybean, which was disappointing to hear about, but quite frankly it was not that expensive and the specs on this phone kick ass anyway. Hopefully February-March? Doesn't bother me, but I'm sure others would like to have the newest software now. For that matter, jellybean 4.2 is coming with wireless hdmi stream! (For Nexus tablet)The processor is fast. It has 1 gig of RAM and it seems to be using about 300mb default to run the phone itself. I'm sure there are background processes going on that I can remove (live wallpapers?? dafuk!), but I was a bit disappointed to run Pandora, and notice that my phone was sitting at 40% of it's memory. This does not impede it's performance. I haven't rooted the phone yet, so I'm sure possibilities exist that I currently do not understand. Streams media 1 process at a time, but it's fast and high quality. This means that if you are listening to music and you open a new media file, it will pause/mute the other (DUH), or if you turn on the camera while listening to music it will also pause/mute until you exit out of the camera.If you go to GSMArena and compare a few phones you'll find that it has the same CPU as the iPhone 4S, but the Xperia P has 2x more RAM. So you can laugh at your outdated friends and family who tote the 4s or less. Anyway, look for yourself if you are interested: google GSM arena and search phone models.The 8MP camera is great. It has superb resolution at close-mid range zoom. If you zoom in all the way, there will be heavy pixelation and a delayed focus, especially if you are aiming at something far away. This sounds like common sense, but I think it should be said anyway. There are also edit options for photos that can enhance resolution. Man you can see like pores on people's faces and stuff. Gross! I have no complaints about the front camera.The speaker: Crystal clear speaker phone. Decent volume level: I compared to a Samsung Galaxy S3 and was put in the dirt. The volume on stock for SG3 was 2x higher than the Xperia P. I read that it can be amped up higher, but I wouldn't chance blowing out the speaker. That would not be fun!The headphone jack antennae is very sensitive so be sure to stand in open spaces, or be away from interference if you want to have best quality reception. I listened to radio for about an hour while messing with the phone, it is clear as day if you are in the right position. The only benefit I think to this function is that you can listen to the radio if you're on the go with those specific headphones in, but realistically it doesn't seem very practical considering you can access internet radio or play libraries of music from the phone itself. To each their own. The ear buds are excellent quality, however. I can hardly hear with them in and no sound on! Sony quality if you don't want to buy a set of Bose or Beats.This phone comes preloaded with tons of useful apps. It also has a few that I guess you wouldn't need that most likely run in the background. I read that you don't need antivirus on an android/smartphone? Whatever I'll leave that one for now, but I guess some other apps such as weather and multimedia player can be removed for faster processing speeds/less memory use. This being my first smartphone, you bet I went crazy in that app store! However, I have not removed any apps that were preloaded. You should always check your running tasks to ensure apps you thought you closed aren't still running in the background. That would kill the battery and slow the phone down.I really like the design of this phone. Buy a screen protector and at least a rubber case. It is made of plastic! I think .. But anyway if you drop it or scratch it it will most likely lose color and just become an ugly mess, so be careful. For some reason, Otterbox has no love for Xperia P. #fragileBattery life ... Hah! Well I can't say I'm surfing the internet, streaming videos, and whatever my manager is doing on his phone when he says hes taking a break every 10 minutes, etc. Don't expect much, the screen itself is 40-50% of the power consumption of this phone. It is probably using all that RAM I can't seem to find! Lol. You get a cool power consumption tool that tells you how wasteful that 4\" screen is! It was at 75% before I checked off a lower setting for brightness. I think I lose about 1% every 3.5-5 minutes browsing the internet/texting/streaming music. So it has roughly a 5.8--8.3 hour battery life if you aren't going crazy with the data use, I imagine. I think some people reported less than 4 hours? Cool story bro.I bought a RAVPower\u00ae 10400mAh Dynamo-On-the-Go RP-PB07 External Battery Pack after reading a bunch of low reviews on the Xperia P because I'm not a helpless child who can't solve insignificant matters. So there you go: want a badass power supply? Buy that too! Charges all kinds of things, inexpensive, portable- you're welcome. Want a product review? It's awesome.The fact that there is no external drive option for memory sort of bothered me. I mean, I guess I've never had to anticipate all the junk I could put on a phone before, just mp3 players and whatnot, but still what if I wanted more options?? Well, my friends, OTG cable saves the day. I won't get into 2.0 USB vs 3.0 USB (10x faster!) because I can't actually say I've uploaded data using the OTG cable with a flash drive into the phone, YET!. ***UPDATE*** This does work. I bought a 3.0 USB and was able to upload movies/music, temporarily for viewing. I do not think you can file manage with a USB attached, you probably need to sync to a computer to upload, although I could be wrong. Do note: using a flash drive in your phone DRAINS the battery. I don't recommend it unless you have a power supply nearby.*** However, if all goes well grab one of these mini-usb male->usb female adapters and bam you supposedly have all kinds of external storage space. Just go buy the flash drive? If it works I'll change this paragraph at a later time. I can say that I plugged my Razer DeathAdder mouse into the OTG cable into the Xperia P and guess what?!? I had a cursor! So cool!It has a mini-HDMI slot, which is pretty cool. I could be cynical about it because I can't imagine how often you are in a setting where you have both your phone and an HDMI cable that you bought separately just for such occasions and you found an HD monitor/TV that just needed the crap stored in your phone to make things complete ... Oops. It's cool, really!Well I'm burnt out on this review. I should mention that GPS works perfectly. It's almost creepy to set it to my location and have a blue arrow floating in my room. Just make sure your data is enabled, of course! I generally leave data off unless I need it to check scores or I get lost somewhere and need to turn on Pandora while I check my facebook and there is no WiFi around, which I mean come on ... how often is that really? GPS data consumption is insignificant, just in case you were wondering.Conclusion: This phone is B A! If you buy it, remember to put your micro sim in, update OS to 4.0, and factory reset immediately. It's fast, faster than the iPhone 4s. If you need something faster, buy a laptop. The camera is great, there are minor flaws in zoom, but overall it is excellent quality with many options, front camera is good as well. The speaker isn't anything crazy, but it's clear and the volume is perfect for speaker phone or listening to music in a relatively quiet setting. The radio antennae is in the headphones, and they are surprisingly good quality. Preloaded with useful apps. Learn to root linux if you want to maximize the performance, but be careful. Fragile design, buy the appropriate accessories. Battery life varies from 4-8 hours. I have not experienced anything less than 6 hours, and I bought a power pack anyway 'cause that's how I do. No external memory drive. Buy OTG cable, connect a flash drive-there you go.I hope this review was helpful. I spent hours reading about various smartphones before I bought this one, and I am happy with my choice. It was extremely cheap, comparatively, and I did not even need a contract! Don't let those complainers fool you with their 2-3 star reviews, This phone deserves nothing less than a 4 (as I am sure others have owned more complex phones, or can afford more options in a single phone), but in my opinion it is a solid smartphone and I would rate 4.5 if it were possible, but it is not so I have rounded up. Thus the 5.0 review.Good luck!", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best Quality Price Ratio", "Author": "saimach2002", "ReviewID": "RQLDPGPOP6PEW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the Sony Xperia P a month ago.

All my previous phones had been from Nokia and I recently jumped ship just as they got into bed with Microsoft. They weren't always the best available phones but they were well made and tough as hell (as the Nokia meme would suggest). So to say I was apprehensive when switching to a new brand would be an understatement.The Good:-The screen is plenty bright and just-right in size for web browsing, videos & texting-While not the greatest, the camera takes decent photos and has a nifty panorama feature-The aluminium case is sturdy and looks awesome. It drew admiration from my friends as it's not a common phone.The Bad:-The battery life is mediocre, at best. I manage to go about a day between charges but I'm not a heavy users. Mostly texting and calls but hardly any web surfing, streaming music or videos.-Decent specs make it a smooth phone for most apps but the upgrade to 4.0 is a must. Even then GIFs don't work well as the phone seems to be bogged down. Not something that was expected seeing the spec sheet.-Wi-fi isn't as quick as it should be. I tried a speed test using my old Nokia C6-01 and the Xperia P not only had worse wi-fi reception it was also ~25 kbps slower. It was from the same spot as well.The WORST:-This phone suffers from signal loss when held a certain way. It's very much like what the iPhone 4 suffered from. To make matters worse it loses signal in my pocket if the antenna is facing down. It seems ridiculous that the radio is so finicky. I have to turn on airplane mode for about 5 seconds, shut it off and then wait a few more seconds to get signal again. At worst I have to turn the phone off and restart it.I definitely DO NOT recommend this phone. Save your money and go elsewhere.

But i wanted a very sexy phone too... so after a lot of research, i found this one that fitted my needs and surpassed my expectations. To begin i dont like \"phones\" with huuuuuge displays, cause the are... logically... HUGE!!! To me they are unconmfortable to hold and operate... and i planned to spend 300$ tops and demonstrate that a very useful phone can cost less than 400$... and this one did it! The 4 inches screen is awesome... very sharp, very coforful, crystal clear, awesomely bright, the whites are outstanding, the blacks not so much but is really decent, good contrast at all!!! The speed is so good, even after the ICS update. Runs smooth. The overall performance is great. The camera takes very good pictures, beyond \"acceptable\". The only cons i have to say (and i don't blame the phone byt the software) is cause after updating the phone, appeared many lags and rebooting troubles, even when after 1 minute the phone gets stable again, this is a pain, but i hope the recently announced upgrade to JB fixes this bugs. I truly recommend this phone so far. If you are on a budget, go for it! Won't regret it! Now it's a little bit cheaper.. around 280$.

My usage is mostly voice and text with a bit of data thrown in for good measure. I upgraded to the latest version of android at the Sony site and all went smoothly. I also installed a battery saver app. Apparently the app is working because my battery life is satisfactory. I signed up with Consumer Cellular with no contract and they sent me a SIM card for free and it arrived activated without being charged for the activation either. I slipped the SIM card into this Sony and was all set to go.The USB cable that was furnished is pretty neat. It plugs into an adapter which in turn is plugged into an electrical outlet to charge the battery. Or, the cable can be removed from the adapter and plugged directly in a USB port on your PC. One cable does it all. A Startup Guide is provided as well. If you want more detail then the Startup Guide provides you can go to the Sony site and read or download a user manual. I decided to print a copy and it came to 152 pages which I put in a binder.There are many versions of the Sony Xperia and this P is a good one and, as I mentioned, it is compatible with Consumer Cellular and, being unlocked, probably other no-contract providers. This may be a bit off topic but I am so pleased to get away from the never-ending two year contract scam that I need to get it of my chest. Every time I made a change to my service or phone it was another automatic renewal of the two year contract. I was paying more than twice as much for just voice as I am paying Consumer Cellular for voice, text and data. Now I can go online, not talk to anyone, and make all kind of changes and it does not cost anything to do so. I am not a shill for Consumer Cellular but for any no-contract provider.

It made a great first impression when it showed up.  I could not use it as a phone for a short time, because I did not have a micro sim for it.  I ordered a micro sim cutter and cut my old Straight Talk At&t; sim card.  It fit perfectly and I got immediate results.  The cool thing about this is that Straight Talk has no idea I am using this instead of my old phone.  One issue I have had so far was I couldnt figure out how to get the data to work.  It ended up being an easy fix though, cause all I had to do was modify the APN settings.  There are a lot of haters out there saying the battery life sucks, but so far it has been better than I expected.  The phone offers all kinds of options to save on battery power.  With limited use I could make a full charge last 2-3 days.  It showed up already set up with Android Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) which is also great.  I read and watched a lot of reviews on this phone and everyone was saying its a great \"middle of the road\" smartphone, but I say its right up there with at least an Iphone 4S.

I'm a non-fussy cellphone user, currently have a basic phone as a back up and it works smashingly well. I've had an Xperia X10 previously, so whatever issues the Xperia P has probably is just another rehash of what the X10 has.That being said, when I say I'm non-fussy, I mean it in a way that I don't need ALL the bells and whistles like some cellphone fanatics are like out there. I ride the bus every day and am amazed how absorbed people are into their phones. I'm not such a person, so this review is for the occasional user who like the perks of a smartphone but don't necessarily care if the 8MP camera doesn't record in 720HD (it has to be in a 6MP setting) or the likes. It's currently on Android Ice Cream Sandwich and works fine, I've lived 2 yrs being stuck on 1.6 to 2.1 from 2010-mid 2012, and only had issues of uploading photos on Twitter, so being at 4.0 is a major improvement.The short end of it is: everything works. It's beautiful, it's flawless, it's fast, sharp, sound is clear, music player works.Now, the battery issue. I found on a forum that a guy blamed the weather widget to be the culprit of such low battery life. I've removed it and found a remarkable improvement in staying power. It'll go down 1% on standby every 15-20mins. It won't compare to my basic phone, a Samsung Gusto 2, which has the battery life of a Spartan (7-10 days with minimal usage), but better than than seeing 10% drain after the first half hour. The Xperia X10 had this battery issue until it got upgraded to Eclair and it cleared up, extending its lifeline to about 5 days on standby. I'm sure the Xperia P will have a solution answered to its battery problem soon.The wireless carrier is your biggest foe with this phone. I have T-Mobile no-contract and so far reception is incredibly poor in my apartment with 2 bars at the most (had ok reception out in the store, but I'll give a more thorough update when i've travelled a bit with it), data transfer can be slow (goes on EDGE most of the time, 3G/4G if I'm lucky) but this is so far only being at home. So the phone works fine, it's my carrier that's the issue. I might have to switch out to a different carrier if things don't improve with T-Mobile.Xperia P will get the upgrade to Android Jelly Bean in the 1Q of 2013, but I'm just praying it won't cause any issues with the phone. My beef with smartphones these days are the companies like Google and Apple who keep upgrading their OS every 6-12 months, causing an ill effect on your smartphones. You depend on the apps to work, but when the apps themselves are updated and are no longer compatible with older OS, then you're screwed. I'd still use my old Xperia X10 if it weren't for the issues of the apps, because the phone worked just fine, maybe needed a battery replacement, but after 3 yrs with the same phone (had the Sony Ericsson w580i for 4 yrs) my apps barely worked.Sony isn't so much to blame if it can't keep up with Google's updates, Google is the one setting the pace, and it's a stupid one. It's far easier to update an OS than to create a new phone with new hardware and match their personal branded software with a new OS. I'm planning on keeping this phone for a long time as long as everything works fine, but I'm afraid that my apps won't survive past 3yrs.**Update Dec 26**After going after T-Mobile and the Sony store, they both told me opposite issues. T-Mobile claimed that it was my phone that was causing the issue of low signals (as the Xperia is not a T-Mobile phone) and the Sony Store said it was the carrier that was the issue. The reason I'd listen to the Sony Store is because the workers there have Sony Xperia phones and are with companies like AT&T;, in which they had great signals while my Xperia P standing right next to them, had a one to 2 bar signal. So I took Sony's advice and shopped for another carrier.I went with StraightTalk and was up and running within 5-10mins after going online and following their activation instructions. My signal is full bar at home instead of no signal or 2 bars. Sure, it did cost me $50 in extra spending because of a faulty carrier, but it's worth the sacrifice. So in my experience with this phone, make sure the phone is compatible with the carrier it's with. In this case in California, T-Mobile is a carrier to avoid for this phone.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone, No issues.", "Author": "Josh Rochester", "ReviewID": "R2XQJFD6STEVE0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Second week using this phone since I received it.

I wanted to replace my iPhone, which I've been a loyal iPhone user for the past 3 or so years, I wanted a change. The Xperia P arrived in less than a week in the mail along with the Skinomi case I purchased along with it. I activated this phone luckily with no activation or sim card fee at my local ATT store. It took a few hours for ATT tech support over the phone to help me configure the data settings (given that I had to call them a few times just to get to an experienced tech) so that I can access the internet and what not. Unfortunately, I still cannot send or received MMS, I've tried configuring manually via googling and youtubing and through ATT tech support, still no luck.Another pitfall with this phone is the battery. I've had this phone for only 2 weeks and last week sometime I left the battery drain all the way as I didn't have a charger handy. I figured an overnight charge would fix this but I was wrong. The next morning I tried powering the phone on and nothing. I was on the phone with Sony support and the first tech sounded like she didn't know what the hell she was doing. I called back and luckily had someone who was (again) experienced enough to help me through this, I was afraid that the phone was deffective (which I'm starting to think it is) and I might have to send it in, being stuck with a basic replacement phone (oh no!). The tech walked me through the trouble shooting and I ended up having to charge the phone for a couple hours(again) as instructed by the Sony tech. After the charge he walked me through it and SURPRISINGLY my phone powered on. What the hell is up with this phone and its battery???? The SAME thing happened to me this morning. I had my phone on the charger last night because it was at about 20%, woke up a couple times during the night to see it was decreasing!! aka DISCHARGING what is this??? I woke up in the morning to see that my phone was completely dead, not turning on, still on its charger..... I contacted the vendor through amazon: Techno.Trading.House, they suggested I do a factory reset which \"might fix it\".. I said screw it, I'm not going through that trouble since my phone is on now, I just need to baby the s*** out of it and keep an eye on the battery...

She loves it.  From my perspective, it is a good Android-based phone that has lived up to and exceeded expectations.  One motivation to get this phone (besides price) was that it would work with an existing SIM card and handles data using WiFi only (i.e. no need for new contract and costly cell data plan).  In all this it works like a champ! ...and no unintentional cell data charges due to hidden data features that we've run across with previous branded (locked) AT&T; phone.The process of moving from older phone with a regular SIM card was a little tricky. We needed to cut/trim it to fit the micro-SIM slot.  But, it was very easy once I found a template online (I think from CNET.)The only complaint I heard early on was how much Android changes between upgrades.  After a few days she upgraded from 3.x (out of the box) to 4.0. (4.1 will be available in mid-2013!) It took some time to re-learn where feature options/settings are controlled.  Also had to figure out where the Android feature settings are versus Sony/Xperia features are set.  No biggie.  My wife is quite tech-savvy.  And despite initial complaints of \"where did that go?\", I think, like most of us Android users, she enjoys the \"adventure\" of figuring out the new features.  (So long as it does not interfere with the core functionality.)A biggest complaint is that it is tricky to configure the messaging to support sending photos via text messaging (SMS/MMS).  This is an AT&T; SMS/MMS configuration issue that many folks using unlocked phones on AT&T;'s network seem to have.  I cannot comment for other carriers.UPDATE (02/06): I recently spent some time to find out how to get this working on the AT&T; SMS/MM network.  I found the correct settings in the Android Central forums. (Go to Android Central and Search for \"AT&T; Android SMS configuration setup\".)  Unfortunately once it is working, it appears to require some data usage to send photos via MMS.  But, oddly enough, not for receiving.(See NOTE below)  In any case, my wife is happy to have this capability working.  Despite the extra $2-$4 it periodically adds to our cell phone bill, it is still much cheaper than a full mobile data plan.Minor cons: No external Flash memory expansion (but with 16G internal and cloud storage apps avail... not a big prob);  Non-removable battery (I know it is the norm nowadays.); external access to microSIM slot (This probably is a great feature for international traveler.  But doesn't this make it easier for thieves to make use of the phone by swapping SIM?)Finally, some pros worth mentioning: nice quality camera; great audio features; crisp clear screen; beautiful aluminum body/case... almost a shame to cover with a protective case (but, too risky not to.)  My wife loves the red.  Finally, Sony will support the latest Android builds with support for 4.1 in 2013.  (No need to upgrade hardware to take advantage of new OS! Plenty of CPU & RAM \"horse-power\" to grow.)Great job Sony!NOTE: It is my understanding that technically SMS/MMS is not supposed to use the high-bandwidth mobile data network that email and web browsing requires.  So IMHO, there should be no mobile data usage/charges.  Apparently AT&T; thinks otherwise if you use an Android phone.  Maybe it is an Android \"issue\"?", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "Victor", "ReviewID": "R3I90FUCWAJQ5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have four months to py xperia phone is excellent, the size is great, the screen is beautiful, with true colors, works great in Venezuela with Digitel and Movistar, for surfing the internet is perfect, and upgrade to android 4.0 and works best even, really is tremendous phone and am very happy with. if you want something even better than recommend the xperia xperia p S.

I have a week on the phone and I feel is tremendous equipment. It responds very well overall.The only two negative comments I have are:- The call audio is too low to be heard even at maximum volume available. This is inconvenient when you receive or make calls in places where you do not have almost total silence to hear clearly. The solution I opted for this problem was to use the speaker, but also becomes uncomfortable depending on where you are. I have to test with headphones to see how they listen.- The second problem, which is not a bad news but all these smart devices today, is the battery.

The screen would occasionally freeze and would not let you do anything unless you turned it off. One problem, it wouldn't let you turn it off no matter how long you held the button down. It has a built in battery so you couldn't take that out to restart it either. You have to do a hard reset by press several buttons until the phone finally resets. It then takes around two full minutes to reboot. Hopefully you weren't expecting an important phone call. This freezing issue happened around three to four times a day. Other than this major issue, the phone looks great and sounds great. But that alone doesn't make it worth buying. If you are going to spend $300 on a phone, get a used iPhone or a Samsung Droid.

It is small enough to hold in your hand, yet you can easily see the display without squinting. However, everything else goes downhill from there.First off, let's talk about the hardware. The phone looked good when I took it out of the case, but as soon as I put it into my pocket, it got scratched by my driver's liscence! No, you read this correctly, a small plastic card managed to scratch the screen. Okay I though, I will just be more carefull and buy a case and never keep anything else in the same pocket.Next, lets talk about the battery life. If you don't use your phone for any light web browsing, just simple text and calls throughout the day, you will get about 8 hours of battery life. If you do, say hello to a dead phone within the next 3 to 4 hours. Even with the \"stamina mode,\" battery life is nothing to be happy about.Let's move on to the operating system. The keyboard provided by the OEM is junk. The same goes for all the applications provided by Sony. You end up hitting the wrong key everytime and it will autocorrect without your permission. Sometimes, it will even stay on the screen even after you closed the application that was using it. This is important to consider because for some reason Sony thought that they had to dictate you to use every application. You cannot delete any of them, although you can use another  one in its place. This is important to consider because this phone does not come with an miniSD card slot. Hence, you will only have about 11 Gb of memory available to begin with.However, the fun does not begin until you install the lastest version of android available for your phone! Jelly bean will really give you headache. As soon as I downloaded it, my phone began to shut itself off randomly about 3-7 times a day. I would have my default applications and widgets switched with the OEM applications. My phone would make random phone calls or delay sending and recieving text messages until the next day(s). It would also reload things that I had deleted or removed from my phone.All in all, this phone was a nightmare. It was a mistake. I am left with a 240 dollar brick that has a mind of its own. I actually had to dig up my brother's old blackberry because of how many things went wrong with this phone. The worst being a 40 dollar data overage fee from my service provider because of it downloaded updates even after I had the settings for data usage turned off. Stay away from this phone or be prepared to root it. That is the only way to get a smooth experience because it has way too many bugs. For the record, I did root it, but I still have a terrible battery life and a ton of scratches.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like the phone, but think it's to techy for me", "Author": "glory_usa \"glory_usa\"", "ReviewID": "R1V1HSA7XUUWQS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually want a phone which is primarily for making phone calls.

I have medium sized hands, and I've used much smaller phones without issue, but this is the first time I felt something really really wrong. There was no way for me to hold it without dropping it. It would always slide down between my fingers while in my hand, especially when making a call. It was like holding a wet bar of soap. The friction on the metal body was practically zero. Slimy and slipperly. My metal iPad has none of these issues. Along with the frictionless body was the flat smooth sides with nothing to cling onto.Sony touts the extra brightness of this phone. And indeed, it is bright. However, that's the only positive thing about it. Even at the lowest brightness setting, everything has a bright haze, especially dark colors, and it only gets worse as you increase the brightness. The viewing angles are also terrible, and the colors are lurid and contrast very poor. It just looks like a hazy, fuzzy, overbright excuse of a screen.The phone itself was laggy and the size made me pine for a large smartphone again.
