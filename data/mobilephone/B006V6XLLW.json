I am not the kind of person who has to have the latest phone version. So I thought, \"Ok, I'll buy a new phone that is a couple versions behind the latest\". It is a nice size phone,  great audio reception and has a great camera, video feature.  OK here's the BUT (drum roll please).... this phone will dial number randomly without my initiation! .... For instance, if I am texting, the phone will dial the person I am texting! Or, here is another example; if I am on a call, it will randomly dial numbers and the person I am talking with will kindly say, \"Can you please stop pushing the keys while we are talking\".. Wow!! Imagine being on a business call or a job interview when this happens!!! Too late to return it... However, my option is to upgrade this phone as I have a Verizon plan..", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "ups & downs", "Author": "amy", "ReviewID": "R1LX2XHNEF6HAI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this phone has great sound and battery life outstanding,down fall- when i purchased it the back wouldnt go on i took it to verizon they couldnt get it on, i couldnt get a new back from amazon so i returned it, also few of the buttons wouldnt work on the keyboard.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Streaming Video YouTube\nBluetooth Supported\nEmail Client Protocols Supported: IMAP, POP, SMTP, Exchange unified inbox / plus GMail client\nHeadphone Jack (3.5mm)\nMusic Player Supported Formats: MP3, WAV, AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, WMA", "Name": "Motorola Droid A855 Android 2.0 Cell phone, Bluetooth, 5 MP auto-focus Camera, Video capture for Verizon", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pq99xaSnL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006V6XLLW"}}
