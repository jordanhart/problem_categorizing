With Windows 8 OS on the phone it has more features then most phones have in this price range.  Features like Microsoft Word and Excel aren't going to be on a phone using android OS or an iPhone for that matter.  Even powerpoint is an option with this phone.  If you own a PC I think you will find this phone to be very user friendly.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works", "Author": "Mahdia Choudhury", "ReviewID": "RCQ7FB2YAHVMA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "with the price, its a good deal.
