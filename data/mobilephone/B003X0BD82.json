My previous phone is 4 years old so it was about time as well.Watch out for one thing: you can update the firmware to build version 1.1.A.0.8 through the software in your computer or over-the-air. This, however, is not the latest firmware.In some countries you'll be able to update it to a later version and in some others even up to Android 2.1 (just released in some European countries last week).What's the relevance of all this? That firmware upgrade fixes a flaw in the device: sometimes, depending on the sim cards being used, the phone will not turn on with a sim card inside if you happened to switch sim cards. Additionally, sometimes it will not turn on with a sim card inside if you let the battery discharge completely (which is necessary at the beginning at least, to optimize battery performance).I've worked with 3 sims and this has happened to me with 2 of them. The workaround is this: leave the sim card inside and plug the usb cable into the computer and to the phone, turn on the phone while pressing the back key. If this does not work then try to just connect the cable to the computer (not the phone) then hold the back key as you connect it to the phone. Release until it turns on.Finally, if nothing worked, select update/repair through the update software and it will flash the device to the \"latest\" version you're being allowed to download.What....you ask what SE said about all this?
