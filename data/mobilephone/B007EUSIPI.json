I bought this phone to replace my Motorola i776 flip from Sprint.I was fed up of having a contract for whenever upgrading the phone or service. Hence the reason for switching to a unlocked GSM phone.*This model Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus GT-S7500L is a mid range Android phone, which was released this past Feb, 2012. Please be advised that the instruction manual was in Spanish. This was a minor setback, I was able to download the English PDF instructions from Samsung website.*There are tons of free apps to download.*Phone, text and internet service provided by Simple Mobile. Phone and text works fine, however since Simple Mobile have not yet tested the Samsung GT-S7500L the phone is considered as unsupported. I was able to get MMSC settings from another approved Samsung Galaxy model to work on the EDGE network (2g). When not on the EDGE network it routes to my home Wi-Fi which work quite well for surfing and downloading apps.*The 5 megapixel camera takes good pictures and can be shared to Facebook. I wished this had a rear facing camera.*The keyboard can be a bit touchy, it takes some time getting acclimated. People with small fingers would do just fine.*The screen size is adequate for my needs, and the display is rich. I like the fact that the the screen can auto rotate from portrait to landscape.*Battery life is about average depending on how the device is used. This will vary from person to person. So far I have to recharge about after 24hrs of use.*My overall impression was quite good for a first time user of a Android phone.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good phone for the price...

Included headphones, USB data link cable, a quick start guide, and two charging adaptors. Only problem - they fail to mention that the power adaptor with the cord is for Australia/China style outlets. The included American adaptor only fits a European style plug, so there is no way to charge from a wall outlet with the supplied chargers. Luckily I have a USB adaptor that works with my 110v American outlet so I'm covered. Just be sure you have something similar, or you'll have to use the USB cable to charge.The phone is great for people who want a smartphone but don't want to spend a week's pay to get it.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "More or less a suitable buy.", "Author": "Devon McBrown", "ReviewID": "R9BPVHT8V13HI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the the phone; however, one of the main purchase point of this item was that it was upgradeable to android 4.2 from the 2.1 OS.
