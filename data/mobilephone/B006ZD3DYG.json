{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Reasons This Is A Good Phone", "Author": "W. freeman", "ReviewID": "R33L21ROHS5JHA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For starters i really hate big flat bulky regular cell phones. I don't like to have to lock and unlock the phone to use it every time i need to make a call of want to text etc. Flips phones are dying quickly, why? Well because everyone wants to look cool while using their touch screen phone to text or just scroll down through things like they are doing something important. I think it's much cooler (not that i care) to receive a call flip open the phone, talk, then flip the phone shut and be done with it, without having to touch ANY buttons what so ever. The phone is decently made, not made of steel, but hey, what is. It's also very compact and fits right into my pocket with ease. All without having to worry about dialing numbers or hitting send while being tucked away. My dad has left his phone on several times because he forgot to lock it after a call, or forgot to hit the end button after the call. He actually wasted over 200 minutes one time.Other good features are that the speaker phone is very loud, it plays MP3s which are also very loud, and the ring tones are actually TOO loud, but it's easy to adjust by the simple volume button on the side. It plays Mp4s, wmv, mpeg and about any other format of video that you can think of, yes the screen is small but if your bored you can watch a whole movie with ease, and the picture actually looks good. A few gripes is that there are no other settings for receiving and IM other than the default. The navigation is a little tricky, yet smooth once you figure out where everything is. Yes the phone seems, and maybe even looks dated, but i could care less, i have no interest in launching the space shuttle, or even opening my locked doors at home with a PHONE!! I use it for phone calls that's it.I had the LG 900 which i thought was a good deal, and ending up being a nightmare because NO one could hear me, no matter how good the signal or how loud i spoke. The virgin mobile version of this phone is bad, not because of the phone, but because the service is the most limited you can find. Especially here in WV with all the mountains etc. I haven't had one problem getting a full signal everywhere i go. And not even close to a dropped call. I use to love the 2009 Samsung phone i had with the drop down keyboard, but once again, lock, unlock, lock, unlock, what a pain! Also it couldn't even play regular videos and the mp3's sounded like crap. Also this phone has FM radio for if your out in the forest or somewhere camping perhaps?So all in all this is a really good phone and i definitely prefer this type of flip phone over any type of Android, or Iphone. I work on computers and love electronics but this phone thing has really gone to far. If you can't wait until you get home to check email, facebook, or browse the web, then you have some issues.(Which this phone can do, i just don't use it for that). Use a laptop or netbook. So don't let the lack of or bad reviews steer you clear of this phone, most are not with NET10, with whom i've had for over 5 years and no problems at all. Most of those reviews are straight talk, AT&T; or Virgin Mobile. So enjoy flipping your phone on and off, i do.

Fact is, it actually has a lot more features than equally priced phones.I really wanted to keep it, but I don't get very good reception inside my house (1-2 bars, 3 on a good day) and I've read Verizon phones get better coverage at our isolated central CA coast. I also hate not being able to swap out the retarded games and that I can't find any plastic/rubber covers to protect the fragile glass on the phone's front (only found bulky leather cases and useless vinyl skins).  I had to return it and am going to try some other phones...maybe I'll come back.PROS: *  Loud rings *  Loud speaker-phone *  Caller ID on outer display (number only) *  2 megapixel camera + video recorder *  MP3 player + FM radio *  Accepts up to 32 Gigabyte of removable memory *  Standard 3.5 mm earphone jack *  Voice recorderCONS: *  Tiny 1.5 inch screen w/poor res *  Very limited/slow 2G mobile web *  w/ slow 2G, 10\u00a2 per minute web use is high (other cell providers only charge 99\u00a2 all day - and only on the days you use it) *  Non-functional calculator *  Useless \"games & apps\" *  No dust cover on USB port *  No OEM or third party protective covers", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Decent Phone", "Author": "BillPeek", "ReviewID": "RX53R735WM3RJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice appearance.  Phone works quite well.  However, when trying to watch a video, a \"Video failed to open\" error message always pops up, even with videos  of the correct format.  Its Motorola BQ50 battery is long-lasting (my previous phone used it) and replacements for it are inexpensive.  When I registered the phone online, its activation was virtually instantaneous.The MP3 player sounds fine with a pair of Sony W08 headphones purchased for around $8 from --who else? -- Amazon.  However, the phone has only a few MB of  available memory, so a microSD card is a must.  But the card must be inserted inside the phone in a slot similar to a SIM card slot and apparently isn't intended to be removed often once it is installed.  It might, therefore, be a good idea to add music to the phone using a USB cable, which isn't included with the phone.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "fantastic phone! but very poor support from NET10", "Author": "P.

Collins", "ReviewID": "R272LN25WK0Y54", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I returned this phone because I decided that Net10 was not what I wanted. Literally less than a minute of activating my phone with a new number, I received a spam call. Shortly after that I started receiving spam texts! I decided to not go with Net10 so I returned the phone. But it seemed like a pretty good phone for $30.I didn't use the phone for long, but it appeared to be good quality. The buttons are large and easy to access. It's very basic but would fit the needs of someone who just needs texts and voice calls. The camera is very basic as well.Overall, I decided not to go with net10 for a few reasons beyond the spam calls/texts with the number.1) Picture messages cost 2.5 minutes each, and I normally send a fair amount of picture messages of my daughter to keep in touch with grandparents so they can be a part of our daily lives even though they are in another state. My minutes would probably not last long.. I was going to try the 300 minutes for $30 dollars. Those 300 would go fast given how much I use the phone, and it would not end up being affordable for me.2) There's no way to see who sends a text to you, without opening the text message. It costs to open the message, so you could be paying for a spam text.I decided it wasn't for me and had myself added to a pre-existing family plan with my family so we could keep in touch better.Net10 isn't horrible I am sure, but it's not for me. It would be better for those who rarely use their phone, or just need a cheaper non-contract phone to use. Or someone who doesn't need picture messaging on a regular basis. I decided that I would be using my phone more heavily than I had originally anticipated, so a family plan was the best idea.If you need a basic phone and are okay with the plans that net10 offers, this motorola will probably work perfectly for you.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "C.

While it offers the ability to browse the web, take photo's and videos, listen to music (even FM radio!), text and photo message, and all the various miscellaneous tasks we've come to associate with the devices we now associate with the term \"phone\", this one is, at it's core, truly, a phone!We were looking for \"a phone\" to enable us to remain in contact on those rare occasions when we weren't at home and needed to be reached by family, or for a true emergency. This fit the bill nicely. It's compact and exceptionally lightweight. \"Butt-dialing\" isn't possible as it's a flip phone. The screen, while small, is clear and easily read. If you need to take photo's (an accident perhaps or Aunt Bessie's 90th Birthday?) the camera is capable of multiple resolutions and is easily handled.Combined with Net10's very flexible service packages, this phone is just the ticket for those who need just that: a phone and good, reliable service at a minimum of cost, fuss and bother.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple, yet highly adequate", "Author": "J.

If all you care about is making a call once in a while, it should suit you just fine since it nails the core strengths: the keys are nice, big, solid, and rubberized, and voice quality is quite clear.  With Bluetooth, a 2 megapixel camera, and room for a 32MB SD memory card, the specs ain't bad at all, and it has expected functions like an MP3 player, FM radio, and voice & video recorders.  There's also a \"browser\" that's probably best left unused, plus one nice feature all phones should have: the ability to turn itself off/on at preset times.Motorola got some of the details wrong though.  The menu layouts can be counterintuitive, with some functions/adjustments buried in areas you wouldn't expect, which can call for weird sequences of button pressing (even the calculator is screwy, with the decimal key being way up at the top of the pad).  I also can't believe this phone doesn't let you customize the 4-way shortcut keys on the directional pad -- this has been standard on every phone for years, and you'd think it'd be super easy to add.  Also, the charging port is proprietary instead of MicroUSB, so you'll have to buy a cable if you ever want to transfer data.So it's still a good enough phone, but the funny thing is that Motorola already topped it with a model they released back in 2009 called the EM326G -- a slider phone that can do almost everything this one can do while sharing few of the flaws (i.e. it has MicroUSB and programmable shortcuts, plus it looks cooler).

That being the W409g. However, it did not take long for me to dislike the phone. First, the volume controls were located in a place so that every time I pulled the phone out of its carrying case it would change the volume level. Next, the design of the phone made it difficult to grab hold of it and open it quickly. I had to fumble around with it so that one hand was holding one side and my other hand the other side so I could pull it apart. In addition, whether being slightly smaller or smoother in texture than my 375 model, the phone slipped out of my case and I lost it, only to get it back several days later after having to deal with the headache of Net 10 customer service. And finally, once I did get it back I installed a 16 GB memory card, and when I hooked up my computer to the phone the computer did not recognize the card. This in addition to the memory card falling apart inside the phone. Then I had to destroy the memory card connector of the phone in order to get the memory card out, Just problems and bad luck with this phone. Replaced it with the LG 800.
