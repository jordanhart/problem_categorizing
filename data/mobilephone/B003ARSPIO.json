{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The little phone that could... almost", "Author": "T. Harris \"wanderingtaoist\"", "ReviewID": "R1X1UUNKS1XHMT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I did manage to configure the GW525 with full Internet and MMS functions on the AT&T; network. You'll find those at the end of this review.The LG GW525 is an interesting little phone in that it doesn't look like it should have the capabilities it has. There's a lot of stuff packed into such a small, cheap and ultimately kiddy looking phone, which gives it a quirky appeal. Unfortunately its features are bogged down by a sluggish interface and functionalites and lackluster UI design.To compare the GW525 with similar phones like the Samsung Impression for instance, the Impression is a superior phone by far, mainly because of its functionality, intuitiveness and speed. But the GW525 has some things to offer if you're willing to put up with a few nuances.Pros:Flexible texting and multimedia features:The GW525 has feature rich photo and video editors. You can even insert photos into your video and you can export video scenes as photos. And when I say rich I mean you can select videos and photos, drop them into the movie editor with a title, credits, color grading and transitions with a soundtrack. With enough light the camera takes awesome vivid photos. In low light photos are soft, flat and grainy.Threaded text messages:This feature is great for keeping track of text conversations. Layout and design is nice and this is one of the phone's best features.POP3 and IMAP support out the box:You're able to configure unlimited pop3 and imap accounts including native support for Microsoft Exchange.Full Address Support:This is one my biggest peeves for cell phones. My friends have physical homes not just cells and email. So I always look for address books that support home addresses, businesses and websites and fortunately the GW525 supports this and more with business info, web info and birthdays and anniversary settings that automatically ask you if you want these events transferred to your calendar.Support for Google, gmail, Youtube and Blogger. I use blogger so it's a nice plus.Document Support: you can view PDFs and Word files though on the small screen it's a bit of a chore. That's a hint that it probably support excel files as well.So what's the bad?The touch interface is slow and sluggish with plenty of lag.  It can take up to 5 seconds to access your photos, videos and music and it can take as long as 1-3 seconds for the touchscreen to respond to a swipe if you're browsing photos for example.Screen real estate at 2.8 inches is way too small for what the phone can do. Most icons are simply too small to manipulate to the point of needing a stylus to get any consistent accuracy. If you want to add a photo to a contact for example, it's very easy to select the wrong photo while scrolling through your library. Then you have to just start the process all over again. Trying to select the scroll bar on the side is also hit and miss without a stylus.The browser is a complete disaster. It does not have a dedicated button to call up the hidden browser like on the Impression for example. Touching the screen calls up the browser. So if you want to click a link, you'll call up the browser instead. It took a dozen tries to select the profile link on Facebook. Also the browser will confuse you wanting to scroll around the screen with resizing the page. A simple drag to scroll around the page will instead render your text so tiny it's unreadable.No G3. When you try to view HD videos on youtube this limitation will be very apparent as it chokes on the higher bandwidth. SD video works fine.This is an unlocked (though not unbranded) cell phone so it's pretty stripped down in  terms of software. I  never thought I'd miss the stuff AT&T; forces you to take, but some things like IM integration (AIM, Yahoo!, Windows Live) I did actually miss.LiveSquare features Avatars for people who call and text you. They hang out on one of two backgrounds (you can add your own though) and you can interact with these avatars (human or animal) to call or text your friends back, access their contact listing, etc. There is a wide variety of avatar choices though they don't really change all that much. Honestly this is a very gimmicky feature that mainly kids would like, but it is kinda cool.I like the feel of the keys.  Where the keys on the Impression feel sorta soft and mushy the keys on the GW525 are firm and snappy.Sound quality is ok for calls but the audio for music sounds awesome. No audio jack though that's always a bummer.I like the feel of the back of the phone. It feels almost like wetsuit material. So if you manage to drop the GW525 in water I believe there's a really good chance it'll survive.Overall it's a decent phone. If LG increases the screen size to 3.2, optimize the OS so you lose the lag and and get G3 working and this would be an awesome phone.Phone calls and text will work as soon as you put your sim in. But we've got some work to do to get all the other functions up and running. You'll need to manually configure the GW525 for Internet Access, Streaming Access, Java Apps, MMS, and email. Unfortunately these are scattered all over the place but not to worry this will guide you through and get the phone up and running in a few minutes on the AT&T; Network.Touch the main menu button (4 dots in the square) touch settings and connectivity.First you need to configure your access, so click Access  Points and input the following data:Add Access PointName it whatever you wantBearer: GPRSAuthentication: PAPUsername: WAP@CINGULARGPRS.COM (all caps)Password: CINGULAR1APN: wap.cingularThat's all done.

Hemphill \"music fan\"", "ReviewID": "R20HEBNEEZX0DZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone despite all the mixed reviews. It's a really nice phone. I like it. Call quality is great, texting is super easy. The internet capabilities could be taken up a notch, but nothing to complain about. The camera on the phone takes really good pictures if you hold perfectly still in a well lit area. A flash would've been nice. The touch screen is decently responsive not the smoothest, but is fine once you get used to it.I have this phone set up with T-mobile. I got everything working the first day with just the information that is provided on their website. Calls and texts worked as soon as I turned on the phone, but I had to do manual configurations for the internet.So far the battery life is really good. I've been talking on and off all day, browsing the internet, texting continuously, and listening to mp3s since early in the morning, and the battery isn't even half way drained.I downloaded a new browser for the phone because the one that is pre-installed is too slow and cumbersome. Remember this is an international phone and has basic bare bones apps and features, but it allows for a lot of customization.There are LG headphones that come with the phone they have a pretty good sound quality, and so does the speaker that is on the phone, so your mp3s sound good.I use this phone for calls(imagine that), insane amounts of texting, and passing the time by looking stuff up online, playing little games, checking facebook, and watching youtube while in long lines.It's not a mp3 player/digital camera replacement all in one device, it can handle those things but not well enough for me to put away my ipod, or start a photo collection with it.If you want a good phone with a couple of toys, bells, and whistles this phone could be for you. A lot of the negative reviews I've read are based on what the phone is lacking, but for this price I think it's fine. If you need a 4G phone that does everything at lightning speed maybe you should think about speeding a few hundred on something else.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good international phone", "Author": "S.R.
