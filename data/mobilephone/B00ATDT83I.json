Something as simple as making a phone call.When you load Skipe and use it, it wants to use Skipe for every call, even local calls. You have to disable the skipe then log back in for when you need it.The phone has too long of a lag between pages and is very frustrating.I might go back to an HTC until Samsung works all the bugs out.
