{"Reviews": [{"Title": "See it for what it is...", "Author": "Jose", "ReviewID": "R1C1HJRDC9FACO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Online I've seen people bash this little phone because they fail to see it for what it is...a budget android phone. For $79 people expect this little guy to be on par with the most advanced phones out there. Yes it lacks the bells and whistles that other phones have, yes it is small, yes it's camera isn't equal to an SLR - but if you stop and think about what this phone is you'll see that it's a pretty decent little unit for those who's needs it meets. You have to see what MetroPCS is doing - they're creating a \"step ladder\" of phones that meet the varying needs of smartphone customers and give all their customers the ability to try android to see how they like it. This phone would be the base level on that ladder - if your needs are greater then you could check the next rung up which would be the Huawei Ascend, if that does not meet your needs then you would check the next rung which would be the LG Optimus M, if that doesn't meet your needs you could continue until you get to their top tier phone offerings. For $79 and $50 monthly service you get a smartphone with 500mhz processor, android 2.2.2, basic camera (no flash), access to the marketplace, wifi, unlimited calls, text and web. The phone is not the fastest processor-wise, the scrolling on the menus is a bit laggy, but not anything to affect phone function. The camera is basic, but nothing too much worse than what is on the LG Optimus M (also on Metro PCS). Calls are ok, and texting takes a while to master on the small screen; if you use swype this is alleviated a bit. Wifi works without a hitch, and GPS hones in on your position within a reasonable amount of time. I tried google maps and MetroNavigator and found them to be functional and useful. The only downside to this phone is the bloatware - since the processor isn't the fastest having all these useless apps running in the background contributes to the phone lagging up. I think that if the bloatware was removed it would run better. I have yet to try any games, but surmise that Angry Birds (free version) would lag up because of the adds. What really makes this unit stand out is the \"DTS\" for the music playback - I was suprised that this little dude beat out my Optimus M when playing back music on Slacker Radio over the built in speaker. The music was not awe inspiring, but sounded fuller and truer than on other similar phones.All in all this is a great phone for those who want to see what the Android hype is all about without paying through the nose. You get a fully functional smartphone with data, at the cost of performance and features. If this sounds good to you, buy it you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for more I would recommend you start at the Optimus M and work your way up. If more people would follow this advice they wouldn't be knocking this little guy constantly.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's OK.", "Author": "Tru Blu", "ReviewID": "R2ZA7N2WFP9D6G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For $80, this phone is a decent bargain. It's pretty close to the smallest Android phone(definitely the smallest at its price), and the battery life is decent. Call quality can be choppy sometimes. Those with huge digits will have trouble texting since the touchscreen keyboard is tiny. Watching videos requires patience because after it runs a video for a few seconds it freezes to load another minute or so before it resumes. It comes with a memory card which is a plus. The camera is below-average on quality, and the speakerphone phone function could be stronger. On the plus side, it plays some apps/games well. Quick, or even reasonably quick, downloading will require a very strong WiFi connection. For 50 bucks  a month (55 or 56 with insurance), it's a good rate. Boost can match that but they'll require 40 to 60 more bucks for a phone that's clearly a notch or two better than this one.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "NICE LITTLE PHONE", "Author": "GEOATL", "ReviewID": "R13M03QS9TJTFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone a few months ago and I enjoy it.

For a first timer using this phone, it is good. Took a while though to use facebook, which comes installed.Pros:  ~The camera and video might not be the best for a phone, but for a starter, it is decent.  ~The wifi is very good, not lighting fast but very good.  ~Expandable till 32GB  ~This product comes with a free memory card!  ~The price is decent. I bought mine at one of the stores at $39.  ~Can't go wrong with Metro's $50 plan with unlimited call, texts, web and everything in between.Cons:  ~The screen is so tiny. I have big fingers and have a hard time texting.  ~Apps that have ads, like Angry Birds, tend to lag up and have to force close a lot.  ~There's youtube but when a video starts, after a few seconds it stops and resumes after several minutes.  ~Facebook is such a hassle. Prefer to use the web instead of the app.  ~The phone memory is too small, so every hour or so it always says Low on Space.Overall, if you're a first time user of andrioid, this phone ain';t perfect but good enough for a low price.

Let me tell you what it does abominably badly.1) The battery door falls off, with no help.  You will first loose the door and then your battery, or you will hold it in with tape.2) It will choose which format the screen will be in, and that will not be the format that you want.  So when you want to text; it will be stuck in portrait, but if you want to see who is phoning you (not texting) before you answer; it will often display a landscape format keyboard covering the entire screen and refuse to exit it until you answer the phone.3) Even though this is an Android; it will not let you download all Android apps.  I don't know if the Getro store filters out things they don't get a kickback on, or just the useful programs.  They will claim it will download any and everything.  It won't, and once they have your money; they can't get it to work either.4) Say interesting things when you talk, because you will spend a lot of time hearing echoes of your half of the conversation.5) Your Getro PCS bill will not be what they say it will be, and it will NOT be lower.If you get this dog; buy insurance because you will be throwing it against the wall a lot.  Don't worry though.  They'll probably charge you for insurance if you ask for it or not.  Me, I ate the wasted money and went back to ATT and my old phone.  Anything would have been an improvement over the Huawei, including two tin cans and a string. - d.belillo", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "alight phone but seller send me a defective one", "Author": "Lance213", "ReviewID": "R30FE5NIQ54GGQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Phone seem okay it specs are not that of a top notch phone but it should do what it said it can do but seller send me a damaged defective one all and all if you don't have the money to buy one of the expensive than this is a good enough phone for you. Also The Huawei M835 Keeps Restarting by itself let me explain i would turn on the phone than do whatever i was doing with it than when am done i usually do not turn off the phone but instead i turn off the phone display. When you turn off the phone display and then turn it back on there is a lock screen this is where it restart by itself i would turn off the display put the phone on standby and than leave the phone there. But than like 5-10 minutes later the phone would restart itself i could hear the metropcs sound and than check on the phone and see that it was rebooting it self. Now this only happen if i turn of the phone display if i turn the phone completely off than it does not turn it self back on also when i am using the phone it does not restart no matter how long i used it for but when i turn off the display 5-10 minutes later it would always restart for no reason.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sucks!", "Author": "T.
