Gowen", "ReviewID": "RXLOTITVZ0XWZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I admit that this phone is inferior to many smart-phones that are currently on the market. Those all, however, require a data plan to use. If you are like me and want a quality phone without having to pay for a data plan then this is the phone for you. I have been using a BlackBerry Pearl for the last 6 years, so I am pretty familiar with its pros and cons.Pros:-Modified qwerty keyboard. While it is not a full qwerty (most of the buttons share two letters) I only commonly run across one mix up (\"see\" and \"are\"). That is a HUGE improvement over 9 key.-A smart phone quality calendar.-Very good media player-Bluetooth-Great Address book options.-Unlimited text inbox space; not the 250-500 text limit that virtually all phones have.-Many text search options. Great for when you are looking for that text you need but can't remember when you got it or who sent it.-Voice dialing-Fits very well into a pocket-Can set any size file as a ringtone, alarm, etc....I could go onCons:-The camera and video camera are not very good. I understand that there are people for whom a phone camera is more important than a calendar or address book or wifi then this is not the phone for you.-Much like a roller ball mouse, every year or so the track ball needs to be cleaned. There are many tutorials online that explain how this should be done. Once cleaned it works like new.-The headphone jack is smaller than is standard for headphones. If you want the standard 3.5mm jack then you probably want to upgrade to the 8120 or 8130.I have used many many phones, but this is far and away the best NON-SMART phone I have ever used.

I don't agree with any of the negative comments whatsoever. First of all the comment that said the mouse movement is bad is false. I mean if you don't know how to use the phone don't write stupid s***! If a good owner would've known the device as well as they think they do, they would've changed the mouse speed in the setting. Don't write a review if you don't even know how to use the phone. Seriously it kills time for people who actually want to buy something.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Smartphone!", "Author": "Chase", "ReviewID": "R2FOYI4TKEFGLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It may not be a \"State of the art\" smartphone but if your a person that just wants a functional, reliable, simple phone this is the phone for you. I'm not the kind of person that likes touchscreen phones because I like to have a physical keyboard to text on. Granted, it takes some time getting used to but its a pocket sized phone that you can bring anywhere! It has the perks of a smartphone, yet a classic phone feeling. Its a nice affordable phone to have and I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a simple, yet sleek smartphone.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "pick something elese", "Author": "A.

I do NOT go on the internet, take photos, or anything else. I just needed a very basic phone for communication only.Anyway, the keyboard on this phone is excellent! I used to have an LG Xenon, which had a full keyboard. Because it had a full keyboard, I texted extremely slowly. As soon as I got this Blackberry Pearl, however, I was able to text very quickly. Each key has 1-2 letters on it, which makes the keyboard a lot smaller and therefore easier to text. It has a dictionary, so it knows what words you are trying to text MOST of the time. Sometimes it gets it wrong, but most of the time I have no issues. The main word it mixes up is \"see\" and \"are\".When it comes to phone calls, I never have an issue with that. The battery lasts throughout the entire call. I make calls that are a good 2hours sometimes. The Blackberry has no problem with battery life. The sound is perfectly fine. I can hear the other person very clearly. My calls are NEVER dropped on this phone. It is great.Once in awhile I will take photos. The photos are good quality, but they honestly do not compare to my digital camera. If I need to take a quick snap shot, I will use my phone. If I need to take a good quality photo, then my digital camera is the answer.One thing that bugs me about this phone is the alarm system. You are limited to ONE alarm, which really stinks because I could really use at least 2 alarms.Lastly, the main reason I am giving ths onlly 3 stars is due to the fact that the faulty USB port makes it difficult to charge at times. My phone will be nearly dead, so I go to plug it in and the phone does not seem to realize that it is plugged in. I take it out, plug it back in, remove it yet again, plug it back in once more, and get nothing. I will remove the battery, place it back into the phone, and still get no charge signal. I then decide to remove the battery, remove my SIM card, replace the battery, try yet again, and SOMETIMES I will finally get a charge signal on the phone. It's one of those annoying things where you have to play around with everything until you can finally get it to charge up. I am not the only one with this problem. If you look it up online, other people have the same exact problem with their Blackberry Pearls. It is a result of the USB port being faulty, which makes sense because when I plug my phone in, the USB port seems to be slightly movable, when it should be solid and stable.Anyway, if the USB port was not an issue, I would have given a higher rating. It is a great phone, but you may want to consider getting a battery charger, just in case you have a tough time struggling with the USB port like me.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "great cell phone", "Author": "Annette", "ReviewID": "R12H3NKR2SE4B4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "love this phone love the 3 speakers  size and durabilty dropped it twice  and nothing wrong just a few scrathes on the phone", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Blackberry 8110", "Author": "PatB", "ReviewID": "ROFSI92XX00B4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this phone before but the rollerball was acting up, replaced it to no avail so I justordered a new phone and IT'S perfect for me, sizewise and action wise so 5*.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "buenos dias", "Author": "Johnnys Melanio Rivero Breto", "ReviewID": "R28MQ80DKLT16F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "good morning\u00a0 the excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad Experience", "Author": "Alpesh D Mehta", "ReviewID": "R18N27FII668UL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We have bought this and after 1 month, software error started coming.
