It was my upgrade from a Samsung GS3, and I use it primarily for the business I run out of my home.  I would recommend it for anyone who uses a phone for business, as its quick, stable, and altogether a superb piece of equipment.

For GPS use it decreases to 7, 8 hours of use.-Its a shame the phone is big due to the camera sensor, i better would  bet for big screen instead. Rear Camera is absolutely perfect for normal light conditions, very, very poor performance on low light conditions (Using superior auto or manual). i know about cheap phones doing a great job with this issue, front camera seems to be underdog compared to its predecesor Xperia Z,  pics always blurry.  Neither sony nor any phone factory understand that megapixels does not matter if you are going to get blurry pictures, better keep doing 1mp cameras.-Sound quality much better than Xperia Z due to new location, but not loud as other brands.-Phone with no lag, runs very fast.-Screen Absolutely nice until you see s4, but remember real life images are not so vivid as displayed in those led phones hehe.-Plug protectors design improved compared to Z-The only thing i could miss from Z is its light weight, Z1 is heavyIf you look for top-notch camera android smartphone, go for other brand. Sony still has to fix and grow in this subject.If you look for durable, waterproof, fast android smarthphone don't look around Z1 is the choice", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it too much", "Author": "Yanan Ramirez \"Yanan\"", "ReviewID": "R3OX4VOHHC3I26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best phone/camera that works underwater, when you unbox this great phone you will be noticed that seller includes an american / central-american energy adapter ( white color ), then this box includes magnetic charger,headset,pc cable, normal charger cable and headset gum replacements, it's a little heavy but it looks beatifull, stylish and good design are things that characterize Sony.You will be happy with this phone, then i recomend some 64 GB mSD class 10 card, and some protection layer that protects body and screen.

I was a little worried because of bad reviews on this matter, but the camera quality succeeds my expectations, except on low-light scenarios.Feels good to the touch. This cellphone is built from strong, solid, materials.The screen resolution is impressive. It could be compared with state-of-the-art LED TVs.Cons:As mentioned above, the quality of pics on low-light places is not as good as in other scenarios. Not bad, could be better.General issue of all smartphones: battery life. I highly encourage users to upgrade the default OS (4.2) and turn the NFC option off to increase battery life. I used the phone for one day with those features on and the battery ran dry in 3/4s of a day.Bear in mind this phone comes with a UK BS 1363 power outlet, but no adapter is included and I find the charging time via PC rather slow.Forgot to mention that it works flawlessly in Costa Rica, using Kolbi.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great smart phone.", "Author": "Warren Mc Kain", "ReviewID": "R25QORJ06DZCYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Made my purchase here, an I have not regretted it yet.

The phone box is maybe 4x5x2 (not sure of exact dimensions), but it was shipped in a HUGE fedex sealed carton.  I mean 3 or 4 phone boxes could have fit inside.  This would not be an issue if enough padding was provided in the box to secure the actual phone box..  But, the box only had one little lousy piece of brown \"packing paper\", maybe 8.5x11, crumbled inside...Result that the phone box bounced/slid/moved around VERY freely inside the much larger fedex box...I consider myself lucky it was not damaged in transit....If I had to buy again I'd find another vendor because that is not a risk I am willing to take a second time...

However, the camera only looks good without zoom in. Compared with Nexus 5, which zooms up to 4 times and still sharp, this Z1 camera's zoom in function is simply cheating. It magnifies the image 4 times without re-focusing. Any image under zoom in is blurry. The price is too high for such a built-in camera.Other comments: the battery lasts 2 days, which is good. But it increased the size dramatically, so compared with Nexus 5, this phone it too big in hand.
