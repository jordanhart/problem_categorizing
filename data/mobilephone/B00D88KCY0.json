{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Haier W910 - 4.5 Inch (1280 x 720px) IPS Screen IP54 waterproof", "Author": "GauloisUSA", "ReviewID": "R1TQEIZYYKCGGB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Haier W910 is a great phone. It is solid and water proof, It is fast and it's screen is not only scratch resistant but bright and sharp.  It's a Galaxy S2 on steroids for 1/3 of the price.On the other hand, this Amazon store, X-STORE,  is selling a product totally useless for the US market. Their  Haier W910 they are selling comes with a Chinese software. With it you cannot download apps from Android Play Store but only from the Chinese store, and of course it's in Chinese. To be able to download Android Market I had to root the phone, and after many tries and errors, I was able to make it work by flashing the ROM. But this is not right, this phone should be a plug and play device.So, unless you are ready to spend hours to make the Haier work (and know how to do it) DO NOT buy this phone from them.  But do buy this phone somewhere else, you will not regret it.I don't understand how a store like this can sell useless products to Amazon USA.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D88KCY0"}}
