And I'm very much liking the Windows Phone OS. I've used Android for years, but this is just so clean and solid. Lots of the apps I was using on Android are available on WinPhone OS now, and the Nokia apps like maps and Driving aid are excellent (like you can download maps by state or country to have offline -- makes the data streaming much lighter). Also some new apps just showed up (like Microsoft solitaire) that completed stuff I was looking for. Nokia also has upgraded their suit of apps, and the new camera beta is really powerful. Hard to believe you get all this for such a good price. Did I mention the replaceable battery, or the microSD card slot for storing pictures, videos, and music? Even has an FM radio built in -- not an Internet one (which it can do too), but a real radio, which is just cool. Also saves on data streaming if there's a radio nearby you like to listen to. (BTW, I got an unlocked one because I don't use ATT and I travel to Asia a lot. It was just as advertised. I believe it came from Malaysia as the system languages out-of-the-box were English, Chinese, and Malay. But it is easy to add other system languages to this WinPhone.

A terrific value.", "Author": "Papoulka", "ReviewID": "REPQGTT9JHKOC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got an unlocked Nokia 520 for $150 from Hasslefree Cell via Amazon.  It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I've bought a few apps from the MS App Store and have learned some things that may help others now, so I'll discuss them briefly.I wanted a basic phone with media player capabilities, at low cost.  I have all \"connectedness\" turned off and can't comment on the Facebook etc apps, nor on the maps and GPS.  I installed a 32GB SD card because I wasn't sure how well it all would work.  Now I wish I'd gotten 64GB.  I have WiFi 'on' only when I'm downloading apps, which works well.I bought YXPlayer for $5, ignoring the negative comments in the MS App Store.  Sadly, it has no support (forum dead for months) and there seems to be no alternative.  BUT reading from the SD, this app smoothly plays all FLVs, AVIs and MKVs I've tried, including 720p and 1080p using x264 encoding.  YXPlayer also handles my FLAC lossless music files, and MP3s.  So I believe it will handle all the formats the vendor claims.  Note that MP3s must be renamed to .RM to play from the SD card.  You might also have to rename MP4s.  All these files can be in subfolders on the SD.  I was worried that the 4\" screen would be too small to enjoy films, but it's just big enough.  This is great: personal theater in the palm of your hand.  My only complaints with YXPlayer are that the dragbar (to move within a film or long audio file) is flaky; and the app will not advance to the next track (music or video) under any conditions.  So you must manually start each song.  That's pretty bad, and unlikely to be fixed at this point.Of course the 520's bundled music player will play MP3s directly, but still without a dragbar, and space on the phone is limited.  If you use that app you'll want to properly tag the files (Artist, Album, Track Name) so the player can sort them out.I bought Fiction Book Reader for $1.  This reads .MOBI and .EPUB books just fine.  To use it, first put the book files on the root (not in a subfolder) of the SD card.  Then use the down-arrow button within FBR to import the file into FBR's workspace in the phone's memory.Most reviews of the 520 oddly omit the MS Office (Word, Excel, and Powerpoint) tools that come with the phone!  With these you can view existing documents and make detail changes eg to cell values.  I find this amazing on such a tiny device.  HOWEVER, in true Microsoft fashion, access to these powerful apps is crippled.  You cannot open documents you've loaded via USB or the SD card!  You can only open files from email or from SkyDrive.  Still, the capability is there and very impressive.I have screen brightness turned all the way up, which seemed essential for movies but would not otherwise be needed.  Battery life under these conditions is probably about 4 hrs of video, but I'm only guessing.Overall the Nokia 520 represents amazing value; probably unbeatable if your needs are as limited as mine.  Consider that an unlocked Nokia 1520 is five times the price!  That has a better quality, 6\" screen, a better toy camera, and twice the raw performance - but performance isn't an issue with the 520; everything responds quickly and smoothly.  The main limitations are inherent with Windows Phone 8, not the 520.  I love it so far.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "unlocked smartphone for half the price", "Author": "Andre", "ReviewID": "R242Y5Y05LTN2X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS: +unlocked smartphone for less than $150, +AGPS+maps, +office suite, +OneNote app, +email clients, +data usage limit monitor/cutoff background app, +many 2G/3G/4G bands +3.5 mm audio jack.

Downside of course that screen is 4 inch with 480x800 resolution which is not that fantastic for productivity. The phone case is some sort of mix between rubber and plastic. This phone might .. maybe .. perhaps .. survive some smaller drops without a extra protective case which is rare in the smartphone category. I appreciated the easy plugin of 3.5 mm computer stereo headphones. Sound recording in OneNote using phone own microphone and playback through headset worked. Having top notch maps and navigation download for free with the phone price is definitely added value. Lumia 520 does not have front facing camera.

Another thing I want to share, when you buy a Lumia 520, it comes with a factory installed screen protector, something we did not know first time around.

It has an offline GPS mode (but there is a slight problem with this...see CONS section)CONS:1. The GPS is only free for local use. If you try using the offline free GPS in another country it will ask you to pay for a licensing fee. That's what happened to me when crossing back and forth from Canada and the USA.2. There is no led light or camera flash on this device. Makes it useless to shoot pictures with at night.3. The keyboard is CRAP! It is seriously terrible... I find that many users like myself end up hitting the comma button repeatedly instead of the space bar. I swear I'm pressing the space bar, but the comma always registers. Also the accuracy of the keyboard is terrible. It makes for an unpleasant experience at times..... I'm not the only one with this issue, as several of my friends have the same problem.Conclusion:Overall, although there are many shortcomings with this phone, it is still good considering the price. I don't think you'd be disappointed with it considering what you get for for the price.

I travel almost year-round, so I wanted to have a device that I could use when connected to Wifi for emails, Skype, Youtube, and things like that. Many hotels, even budget hotels in developing countries, now offer free WiFi for their guests to use.The phone has worked even better than I even hoped it would. Although it is the first smartphone I have owned(so I am not an expert) I really enjoy using Windows 8, and I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of this Nokia smartphone. In regard to \"apps\" I find the amount of apps available at the present time to be most satisfactory. Every time someone has recommended an app(that they use on their Iphone or android phone) it has been available on my Windows phone. Bing News is fantastic when traveling. Having Microsoft Office built-in(available to use when not connected to Wifi) seems incredible. The GPS works great for traveling and(as far as I know) all the maps of the world are available from Nokia for free. The maps are all available right on the phone(need Wifi to download).The maps (and GPS) work offline(when not connected to WiFi). As far as emails(I use hotmail) I can write a new email, or reply to an email, even when I am offline. If I am offline the phone automatically puts the new completed emails into an \"outbox\" folder. The next time the phone is connected to Wifi all of the completed emails are automatically sent. While the emails are in the outbox folder waiting to be sent I can click on an email and edit it, if I want.I purchased an \"unlocked\" phone so that I would have the option to buy local prepaid telephone service if I ever am in a foreign country and wish to have temporary cellphone service.The only negative thing I can say about the phone(and I have the feeling this applies to smartphones in general) is the fact that the smartphone must be charged nearly everyday. To compensate for that I purchased an extra Nokia battery(for about $7 from Amazon) that I carry with me when I am traveling. It is identical to the original batter that came with the phone.The bottom line is that I couldn't be happier than I am with the Nokia Lumia 520 smartphone.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Its a temporary phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2BUH1M8HUTYT9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a real toy but due to the price/pros comparison it is quite ok. I bought it so that I have a phone to use before the Samsung S5 comes along next month.Prosit is cheap. You can buy one for $70.It has 4G, for that price that is good.The touchscreen works very well.The display screen is not bad.The sound is good but that just might be tmobile (i had sprint before which is NOT recommended as a) their reception is horrible and b) they have CDMA phones which you cannot take to another carrier, you are stuck with them). Update-the sound is good on Nokia (and it is not tmobile). Nokia has a good reputation in other Asian countries, the sound is quite good.ConsIt is a windows phone, so goodbye to anything else that you are used to. You cannot download any browser, so goodbye Chrome, Firefox, Opera or the like. You can only use IE and who wants to use that!For any search, you have to use Bing.There is no swipe for keyboard.The annoying tiles you see are there to stay. And worse, you have even more smaller annoying tiles inside them which keep flipping like mad-at first I thought I could upload my contacts pics to that, that would at least make it interesting. but no. No updating, those flipping tiles are there to stay (you can remove some of them but you cannot modify them)The camera is terrible.There are very LIMITED apps. Period.Settings-you cannot change the main screen with an image you like, the tiles are all you get. The lock screen image can be changed.The Phone function is really badly displayed. Your contacts are not easily detectable, you have to do some detective work, run arounds and then you land on a \"People\" screen. Seriously, that is such a run around just to get to your contacts.If this phone had the same or at least a similar UI to Samsung (just the Call aspect) it would be worth looking into. It is very easy to see why these Windows phone are lagging in the market. By restricting users to Microsoft products they have already lost the race in other departments, this is just another example of the same.If you just need something while you are waiting for the next thing, great. All in all, for this price you get a decent phone, too bad it isn't Androit because you do not get the apps and other goodies and also you do not get the Samsung highly user friendly UI.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nnot as described", "Author": "N.

Had a bit of trouble getting it fully updated to the latest firmware but it's ok now. Read and watched articles and vids about this phone so as to know all I needed before I gave it to her. What people who read these comments and watch online is that first off this is a BUDGET phone and not a high-end smartphone but a low costing smartphone that doesn't have much internal storage as the apps are stored direct to the phone itself and it has a 5mp shooter that upon hearing such with no flash to boot there should be 0 issues with that.Stop paying under $200 for a smartphone, getting performance like you've spent $2000 and then question why it doesn't do this or do that? No front facing camera, no large internal storage but take those two away and you have the best budget smartphone avl today. I tested everything and they work perfectly, I was pleasantly surprised by that and I am looking forward to the next major update as for the $ spent on this and getting an update that allows the phone to work on par with those that costs 2/3X more you surely/simply cannot go wrong with this purchase.The App store is as it is small in comparison to others but if you want Apps just for the sake of telling your friends and family I have a phone that I can get every single app out there and they work but in reality only use 2 out of the hundreds of thousands then go ahead by my guest. Makes 0 sense dl an app and complaining about it knowing there are many similar apps that a simple uninstall and re-dl of another is a simplistic solution to your gripe.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "OK for the price", "Author": "M.
