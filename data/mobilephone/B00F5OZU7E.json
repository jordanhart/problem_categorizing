I need a dual sim. I wanted a smaller phone - not a \"phablet\". It hooks into all my other Samsung devices. Very difficult to find accessories that fit to size since it is not that popular a phone and wish it could play music louder. But overall meets exactly my needs as advertised.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best phone to who needs to use two sim cards at the same time", "Author": "Andres Quintana", "ReviewID": "R3YLQZQ7PK2BY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can use the two sim cards at the same time. I can choose the line I want to use to make a call or I can cancel one of them. Very good speed into internet with 3G net and excellent with WiFi. The right size for business people, you can wear it in your pants, shirt or coat pocket. I just love itI got mine before, now I got a couple of them like a Christmas gift.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "The item was sent in wrong color and with European adapater.", "Author": "Javier", "ReviewID": "R3IR4B11KWCPLY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The item was sent in wrong color and with European adapater..
