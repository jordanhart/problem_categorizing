{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Phone With Excellent Features - A Very Detailed Review", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "R3GPS6JGT6BWF6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before purchasing this phone, I had the Galaxy Note that was rather bulky and heavy, yet I still wanted a 5 inch screen, but one a sleeker and lighter weight and newer phone. Since I am a true techie, I researched this phone for all specs as soon as it was released on several websites.  My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size considering the fact that it has the 5 inch screen. It fits easily into my smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out. Because the phone is so light, I carry it easily on my jeans with the pouch/case that I purchased for the phone.- STANDARD SIZED SIM CARD:  Good to know as I did not have to cut my Sim card, I just placed it into the phone and it read my carrier plan and I did not have to set up the APN settings for Internet and MMS as the setup did this for me automatically). This is good to know if you want to use your regular Sim card and not have to deal with settings yourself. What a great feature.- Screen Resolution - For me personally, I find the resolution GOOD to VERY GOOD, however, it is not as good as say an S4 or S3, but good. However, I have a way to make the screen look GREAT and CLEARER on the home page. What I did is installed the free app ZEDGE and choose a wallpaper that has a dark blue background. The picture I choose has a deep blue sky and mountain in it and the home screen is STUNNING and the white letters on the icons really stand out. And I will say that the screen detail is clear and easy to read and webpages are just stunning on this phone!- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and if I am fairly close to the router, the signal strength is excellent. However, when I am a long distance from the router, the signal goes down, however, I still get WiFi and go on the Internet just fine. When not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T; for data and easily get 3G and I have gotten 3G+ (there is no 4G in my area). The data is very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is.- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD (UP TO 64GB SD CARD) - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4 GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: I downloaded a FREE APP called Kingsoft Office which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.- CAMERA - The 8MP takes excellent pictures. So I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised how clear the pictures are. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. Turns out to be a pretty good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- WiFi could be a little stronger, yet it connects quickly and I have never been without WiFi as it never failed me. Close to a router it gets 5 bars and very strong signal. When I am far away, one bar. So performed a test using my Tab 3 8.0 and Tab 2 10.1: Of course these gave me stronger signals because these devices are WiFi only and have probably a larger WiFi receiver inside. So I compared it to my S3 Mini and the signal was close, yet the S3 mini did have a little bit stronger signal.- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...Also, there is a newer Archived Flash out. So ask me in the comments if you need instructions and I will send them to you.- Very small instruction \"manual\" provided with the phone, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal as I use Dropbox to download my photos and files and it is fast and easy.-- International Phone so NO US WARRANTY. Not a problem for me because I have learned over time that if a device is going to fail, it usually does it within the first 30 days. This phone has been great--no problems at all!-- No NFC except on the model of phone. I do not use NFC so I have no problem with that.Bottom line:  Actual stars I rate this phone is 4.5 took off .5 stars because of the WiFi signal not as strong as my little S3 Mini or my Samsung Tablets. Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would because for the money, I believe this is the best deal out there dollar for dollar. Will this phone be a good choice for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from this phone like the S3 or S4 models and also you want just the most important features and don't want to spend twice this amount for a fancier phone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rating the seller, not the product (Produt is good)", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R2F4WJKAZRMIES", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "- The phone stopped working within two weeks of being shipped.- I went on the Amazon site, filled the return form and sent them the phone by Courrier- Wireless Experts responded on May 14, stating that they received it and whether I would like a replacement- I responded the same day saying that I had bought another phone because I couldn't wait and wanted a refund- Wireless Experts responded still the same day (May 14) saying that they would refund.- Wireless Experts CONFIRMED THAT THEY SUBMITTED A RETURN on May 17- On June 8, I received the phone back by mail (the same, not even fixed) and no refund.- I wrote immediately back to Wireless Experts asking for next steps- On June 10, Wireless Experts responded that they sent it to Samsung and since it worked, they sent it back to me (However, the phone DOES NOT work)- On June 11, I reconfirmed to Wireless Experts in an email thata) it didn't work,b) they had told me that they would refund it, andc) what were the next steps.

Not i9082 as advertised here.", "Author": "Nikolai Ivanov \"Nikolai\"", "ReviewID": "R3JLWQ5XP6UU9C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first Android. Upgraded from Nokia E72.Received my Samsung Galaxy Grand and after few days playing with it, I realized, this is not \"i9082L\" model, not \"i9082\".It is not clear how many Galaxy Grand Phones on market. Some specs says Quad Core + NFC.- No NFC (3-pin battery connector. NFC phones have 4-pin NFC battery)I tried Galaxy S3 NFC Battery. Battery size is compatible, but no luck.- Dual Core CPU vs. Quad-Core on many reviews. Google \"galaxy grand quad core\"- No notification light. Annoying after E72.Galaxy S3 has color Notification Light.Most reviews will say it has notification light and point to 2 small dots near speaker but these 2 dots a proximity and light sensors.- I have not tested the USB Host function to connect USB keyboard. Possible Grand does not support OTG.- No HDMA.Huge screen, but low resolution. Noticeable pixels.Tons of smart functions. Makes myself feel dumb :)Messed all my contacts synced with Outlook / Exchange and my old Nokia and Skype. I ended up with 5 contacts with same name and some totally unrelated  contacts were joined.Took me whole weekend to cleanup my contacts.This is not a negative review. Overall, I like the phone. Just want to point you to some issues I have found so far.Installed \"Google Goggles\" and it integrated with the phone camera and scared me.It send every photo you take and send you back ads from google related to the object you took the photo of in about 1 second!Voice Type:My main language is Russian and it recognizes anything I says and ever if I sign a song very fast and mumble! :)I will update my review later.feel free for questions.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unknown Brazilian phone", "Author": "Cy Comer", "ReviewID": "R2NYJRL8DG3HG3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I kept expecting something to be wrong with the phone because it's so much cheaper than the Galaxy S3. This is truly an unlocked dual sim smart phone. I don't know why it isn't sold in the US. The system for using two sims works great. There are options for calling or assigning one sim to use when calling certain contacts. It's designed so that you use data on just one sim unless you physically switch their positions but that's all I wanted anyway.It is not pure android of course and has some Samsung apps you probably don't care about.It doesn't say in the description but this phone isn't manufactured for the US market. I don't think there is much of a market for dual sims as there is in other countries. The one I received was a Brazilian version which worked great for me cause that's where I was going to use it. Just don't call Samsung support in the US if you have a problem. I can live with that.So if you travel and want to keep your sim for people (or work) to still be able to call you put that sim in the second slot and then buy a sim wherever you travel to that supports data and calling in that country. Paying international rates for data roaming is for suckers.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone at a great price", "Author": "Woo Huey Yong", "ReviewID": "R29UQ4NXL3FDZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Dual sim allows me to have two sim cards running at the same time. I am using Data sim on 1 and phone only on sim 2.The dual core processor makes the phone very smooth and the generous RAM allows me to download a huge amount of apps. I am very satisfied with the performance of the phone, especially the reception and speed of the datalink. My previous Android phone has slow datalink whereas the Samsung one has good reception and fast datalink. Samsung is a reliable brand and they use good components for their phones.The only downside is that I am unable to choose SIM 2 when placing the call from the contact app.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "My impression of this phone is improving", "Author": "Farmer", "ReviewID": "RKOK0WVGCVI79", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the phone that could have been but was not!Firstly, anyone spending this kind of money on this phone is a person who wants a decent-to-great android which MUST have dual sim capability. On the good hand, it's super 'smart' to have the phone tech which allows sim 1 to fwd calls to sim 2 when sim 2 is engaged. On the other hand, however, it's super common sense to be able to go to your contacts menu/app and select a contact from your list and then select which sim card you want to call from. This phone does not allow this which makes the duos super stupid!. The only time you can choose which sim card to call from is when you go to the dial pad so you either have to know the person's number by memory or, if appears, have the person's name listed as the last call. How lame! Anyone out there who knows if and how to solve this please enlighten me. Thanks!UPDATE 1. I have since discovered that if you select a contact from your whatsapp contact list and go to 'Contact info' and dial the phone number from there you will get the option to choose which sim you want to make the call from. Still too roundabout to me.UPDATE 2. I have now discovered that when you go to dialpad/keypad, you can use the keypad to find the contact you want by name. When the name appears you select it then you can call from whichever sim card you want. This significantly irradiates my initial complaint. This discovery, however, still doesn't help me when on some idle days I just want to be able scroll down my contact list wondering who I want to talk to.UPDATE 3. Although there is no option to choose between sims when making calls from the call log or contact list I have now discovered that after you select the contact from either the call log or contact list you can simply pull down the Notifications page and from there choose which sim can you want to make the call from. Note, however, that doing so affects which sim is the default sim for making calls. I must still say I didn't have all this beating-around-the-bush with my BLU 5.3. With the BLU you always had call option prompting regardless of where you make the call from.Secondly, there's no notification light which is another basic must-have. Many folks can't have their phone on ring because of work and other professional or social settings. The notification light lets you know there is a message/missed call on your phone that you need to attend to. With no such notification, once you're on vibrate or away from your phone for a short bit you have to keep pressing on the screen to check if you missed anything. This makes you more of a slave to the phone and surely drains battery life at a faster rate.UPDATE: For anyone wondering, although this phone says '3G' you can connect to a '4G' network with it in the Caribbean where I am. I won't be able to speak to the US.UPDATE: I am not sure my Smart Stay isn't working. How is it supposed to work anyway?", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great but your choice", "Author": "Maurice M.

Top10Cell did a great job sending me this phone, but the second phone was obviously used. Amazon gave me a partial refund but I received no word back from Top10Cell in about a week and probably won't and all I was asking for was an explanation of the phone's conditioned when I bought it at new prices and also for them to extend their 14 day return window for 30 days because I wouldn't activate the phone until the return window passed and if it had defects they wouldn't be known until such time and I received no apology or return email or anything. The partial refund was expediently processed and Amazon was eager to help. Lesson: amazon is great, this phone is great and if buying from this seller: do not order one day shipping (which could have been the reason, seeing as this particular purchase was two-day shipping and was received in brand new condition) and just be aware that you may not be able to have support for your product. Also FOR U.S. PEOPLE ONLY: IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS PHONE KNOW THAT ON METRO PCS 2G COVERAGE IS AVAILABLE ONLY, AND THE MULTITASKING FEATURE OF BEING ABLE TO USE THE PHONE AND USE THE DATA AT THE SAME TIME IS NOT AVAILABLE UNLESS IT IS ON 3G NETWORK. OPT FOR AIO WIRELESS WHICH USES AT&T; NETWORK, THEY OFFER 3G AND CLAIM THAT THIS MULTITASKING FEATURE IS AVAILABLE.
