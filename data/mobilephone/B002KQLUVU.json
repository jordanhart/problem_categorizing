If you want bigger buttons get 8330, my sister has one, wish I could switch with hers, but mine is newer and no tracking ball, which I really like to.. about this phone. Its sleek and easy to navigate..Before I had this one I had the 8120, ah--big difference the charge on 8520 last longer and takes a little time to charge up, but its worth it. Also, the keys I wished lighted up a bit brighter, BUT like I said once you have it after a few days you get used to it. My one problem with as I am thinking off the top of my head ..is there are not enough apps to go with or themes made for this model.I am a geek for that, but as of now I have been able to download a few off my blackberry 8120 to my 8520.Also, checking around i was able to get a few more themes, that are just awesome. The 2gb memory card that comes with it I took out and put in my 4gb from my 8120 in it. I read somewhere it can go to 16gb and pretty soon it will go 34gb...its in the works now.I will say the quality in web browsing is GREAT and I have had no problems with dropped calls, lost signal, or getting frustrated with where are the keys for texting; all the numbers are on the left side..feels weird but after a day or so, it works better than my other blkberry which was the 8120.Also there's a dictionary to while your texting, a firewall..it is just way better than I expected. If I go all over, I apologize, I am giving you want I can tell you about this product as I'm writing I'm having a flashback...lol.Now if your a geek like me with apps, there aren't that many games for this Rim..I am waiting for new apps to become more available for my phone for some reason, 8320 has the most..kind-of peeves me at times, wen I am looking around as to adding to my phone but..this phone is pretty easy compared to my 8120.

I jammed a 16G nand flash card into it too so i have music, movies etc with me. I bought the unlocked version since i use the 8520 when traveling to US from abroad .... without a full blackberry data package you lose out on things like email and blackberry messenger - but this is my 2nd/travel phone so i dont care too much - I use it when in the US with pay as you go on at&t; - i get what i want a phone that works, easy texting, wifi browsing and music/video. iPhone is my main phone abroad but it wont stay that way once renewal time comes. I could easily see 8520 being my main phone but if you want the mobile internet experience (3G) and slightly cooler packaging then go for the 9700, but you pay for it - a lot more. given cost differential I would easily buy 8520 over 8900 ...8520 just feels a tad cooler too vs 8900 still too corporate. yet both are pretty similarly equipped. if you had full blackberry data package with this as your main phone u r probably happy person. i am more than happy with this as 2nd/travel phone. Cool thing about this unlocked version is i can buy pay as you go sim card, slip it in and work no matter where i am. in past my edge (non3G) blackberries actually run things like google apps and internet fairly well. i am sure 9700 with full 3G is better but necessary??", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Blackberry Gemini 8520", "Author": "Juan Yanez", "ReviewID": "RJ6OY5NXIZ1HY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good cell phone.

It lacks some of the power that other BlackBerries have - namely, it couldn't work with my job's BES server.  Which is not good.  But in terms of being able to surf the web, and text, and all that good stuff - it's a pretty good phone.This happens to be the first BlackBerry to get the new trackpad, which, I must say, is an excellent replacement for the trackball.  I like its sensitivity - if you don't, you can change it in the General Settings of the phone.I would probably recommend this phone for people who are new to the BlackBerry world - it's a good way to get used to the BlackBerry interface, and develop skills on the platform before getting to the A++ BlackBerry phones (read: Bold and Bold 2, as well as the Storm 2).", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Smartphone", "Author": "JFSC1986 \"bombiyaya\"", "ReviewID": "R3C7COUA57E9IC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my mother and girlfriend and i can say for sure that is a great device, easy to use, great display, great keyboard and the track pad what can i say, just smooth, i don't know about the durability of the track pad but it seems that is going to last longer that the track ball. i would recommend this phone for starters in this world of smart-phones, it very easy to use and to understand the phone.", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "For the Price its my Favorite Blackberry So Far", "Author": "Ziggy Ziggmuff", "ReviewID": "R1QQSNP466FGYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Used to have a Pearl with numerous problems, finally had enough of it and decided to upgrade. Sprint has a deal going on right now where you get $50 for your old phone, and since I was over a year due, I got a $[...] rebate too. So my opinion may be a bit skewed as I got this phone for free. Gotta be honest I HATED Blackberry and didn't understand the attraction to the company when I had my Pearl as it was over-overwhelmingly disappointing since day 1.Well I'm happy to say that I am probably a permanent fan of the BB thanks to this phone. 1st: Thank god BB got rid of the ball, as the sensor-tracker is 100 times better. My ball would go bad, get dirty, etc. This is probably the best tracker I've seen on any phone including the iPhone. I love the BB Messenger capabilities, love the qwerty pad, love the speed of the phone. I have yet to find one flaw regarding the mechanics of this phone. Have downloaded 2 apps thus far for free--Pandora Internet Radio and Google Maps which are must haves (don't even bother using the Maps app loaded on the phone, its terrible) and both have worked like a charm.The only thing I miss is the flash for the camera, as it seems my Pearl took excellent photos compared to a lot of other phones. I haven't had great luck with this one so far, but like I said, its a very small issue compared to the other flaws that have gone away since my upgrade.Not sure how this phone works on other networks, but Sprint is EXCELLENT. I was with AT&T; for years and hated it, and I will never understand its popularity except for the fact its the only network with the never-ending praised, over-rated over-priced iPhone. Sprint may not be popular with the \"hip\" kids these days (but who cares) however I have nothing but good things to say about Sprint, as its coverage and its service are the best I've ever had.If I had the dough, I might saddle up for the Bold, as it seems to be just like this phone but has a couple better features like a better operating system, a higher mega-pixel camera, better speakers for music, ability for a 32G card, and might last better in the long run. But again, the going price for that is $[...], and how can I complain or compare the 2 when I got mine for free? This Curve is probably the best phone deal of my life.If you're a person who hasn't owned a Blackberry before and you're looking to get into it without breaking the bank, this IS the phone I recommend. I have friends who have BB's and like I said I've owned one previously too, and this is BY FAR the best one I've come upon for the price. These things will be unstoppable when they start supporting Flash, which will blow iPhone out of the water, so hopefully isn't too far off.You will love this phone!", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excelente Producto!", "Author": "Felix Mundarain \"M@R@C@IBO\"", "ReviewID": "R5I9P0CPSSPDS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente Producto, tiene todo lo que necesitas, es muy completo.

Using other applications like the Windows live messenger, ubersocial and facebook can diminish this time roughly to the half and maybe less.- Rebooting times takes forever, sometimes it takes over 7-10 mins!In another matters, the phone arrived at perfect conditions with all it's accessories.

It's a magnificent phone, it also has a really nice keypad. This phone is easy to text with and has spell check. It has an alarm and good ring tones. This phone doesn't break easy! It takes amazing photos and it has a zoom up button. It doesn't take long to charge. This is a phone for people who want a more advanced phone, then a flip up or a slide. This phone is also for people with smaller fingers, the keypad is kind of small. This phone will help you spell words correctly, it does have spell check. This phone is awesome. It is easy to figure out in stead of the touch phones. This phone is easy to text with. The only bad thing I have to say about the Black Berry Curve is that it is a little pricey. Its about $200 dollars, but the phone makes up that money! Over all it is a outstanding , easy ,and fun phone. I hope if you get this phone you'll like it. I sure love it.

I keep discovering new things I can do with this phone; it seems like they really did a good job thinking through the design to help maximize productivity.I also like the keyboard; it makes it MUCH easier to type e-mails and text messages than many other phones I've used.I was initially concerned that the replacement for the trackball would be awkward to use, but this wasn't the case. Sometimes I would prefer a touch screen, as it can sometimes be a little bit of a pain if you have to do extensive scrolling, but generally this isn't too cumbersome.My only minor complaint is with a few of the pre-installed apps (e.g. media player, map), which sometimes give uninformative error messages. E.g. \"there was an error playing this media\" - that's nice, what error? And what exactly am I supposed to do about it - wait a few minutes and try again? Reset the device? Replace the media file? Is it even something I can fix at all? In my opinion, having such generic error messages is sloppy UI design on their part; this is certainly something that I would like to see fixed in future software releases. My other complaint is that rebooting the phone takes an unacceptably long time (I have literally timed it at 5 minutes or more); this isn't a big deal most of the time, since I don't have to do it too often, but if it freezes when you need to use it, this can be very irritating.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blackberry 8520", "Author": "Ovelio", "ReviewID": "R3SB021KPSYLCX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Saludos, el presente es para dejar constancia que quede bastante satisfecho por el articulo comprado el mismo satisfizo todas mis espectativas", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "nice phone", "Author": "camilo bustamante", "ReviewID": "R1MSCVJJ5KR80S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "nice phone, all works great, simple but functional, they sent what they said, new phone unopened box just plug the sim and lets talk and text just a activation in my companie and its ready, to work.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone", "Author": "Vanessa Kewley", "ReviewID": "R1858FO31LGZ86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A truly unlocked phone.

The Bold 9780 works much better, faster, and has much better photo quality. Both might freeze once in a while but this will do it more often. If you don't mind spending twice as much on a phone, I suggest you the Bold model. But if your budget is tight this phone will do it. This phone is a bit pricy, should be $120 for what it is, but BB are generally overpriced. This is a great phone for a person that loses phones constantly and wants a working BB. Or if you let your phone fall a lot or let it go for a dive in the pool (even though it will not work later). But if you are a careful person I suggest you buy a Bold model, take good care of it, and enjoy its benefits, avoid headaches, and take very good pictures. I value greatly a good camera on a phone because these pictures will last forever if you save them properly. And it is always better to have a good quality camera.
