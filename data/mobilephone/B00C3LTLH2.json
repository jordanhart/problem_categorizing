My previous phone was a small Galaxy Y Duos S6102 and I was looking for a bigger and newer phone, not very expensive or sophisticated, which would keep me using two SIM (one for personal issues and the other for public matters)That's the Galaxy Grand i9082, a phone with some special functions found in Galaxy S3 and other in Galaxy Note. A phone somehow beetween those two, but cheaper that both of them.A good size to read your mail and even the news, and a good collection of modern and functional apps included (or to be included afterwards).By the way, I live in Costa Rica and works perfectly with local phone companies, either with postpaid or prepeaid chips. .", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Usable and value for money", "Author": "Anastasia D.", "ReviewID": "R1WJ8HL2MEUYG3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung Galaxy Grand i9082L is a great phone for the casual user. Games (esp small ones) play well and so do the videos. The videos can also be zoomed in which is a feature most low end phones don't have. Usability is great.

I bought it in White and it looks and feels great.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very sastisfied", "Author": "Engelberth Rivero", "ReviewID": "RFC5S0H2XLWBS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the operation is performed as agreed all ok very very satisfied very responsible company and the product quality is very good for me I have recommended 100%", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "VERY GOOD PHONE", "Author": "Pedro Silva", "ReviewID": "RIBXAESCJH5HE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NICE PHONE I LIKE IT  Samsung Galaxy Grand i9082L Dual Sim Phone.
