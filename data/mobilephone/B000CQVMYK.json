This phone is meant for one thing -- Style. And not one other phone in the market comes close to this phone in style - and the sales of this phone prove it.The signal strength on this phone is very good. In elevators where I didnt get signal with other phones, this phone picks up enough signal to carry the conversation through without any of those \"didnt hear you - can you repeat that?\". I really havent seen another GSM phone with signal quality as strong as this one, which is funny because this phone's antenna doesnt even stick out (internal antenna). Bluetooth audio is clear - I have verified this with the Jabra BT200 and the Motorola HS820.Camera is good, but not as good as some other phones out there. Video is good, not as good as other phones out there. No memory card. Here's the bottom line - if you want a phone that works like a good phone and looks damn good, this is the phone for you. If you want a phone that does videos / audio etc, then look elsewhere - or wait for the v3i.Want a good looking phone with great voice quality? Buy this phone. Theres really no competition.

A lot of people online have been questioning why someone would get a phone from here for so much money when you can get one from T mobile stores, but if you are not a T mobile customer you need an UNLOCKED version of the phone to use it. All I had to do was put my old sim card in it and it worked! I have not experienced any problems at all with my phone so far. It works great and it is beautiful. It works great as a phone and the camera and video opions are fun. It also comes with software and a cable that connects to your computer so you can transfer songs and pictures to you cell, which is awesome. You can take any song and make it your ringtone for free! I would like to say that a lot of people complain that this phone isn't a great camera, mp3 player, etc...but those things are just for fun extras.

Gareis", "ReviewID": "R1FYIPTOOG1DJG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered the Pink RAZR phone knowing that it would be, just that, a phone. I didn't have any big expectations for cool features, I figured the large price tag was just what you have to pay for style. When I got the phone, I was pleasantly surprised at some of the features, and disappointed with a few flaws.The biggest feature of this phone is undoubtedly the fact that it's pink, svelte, and beautiful. I get tons of compliments on it from just about everyone who sees it. In addition to that, however, I did find that as far as camera phones go, the RAZR's camera was pretty decent. I was also pleasantly surprised at how large and bright the LCD was. My favorite feature, though, is the mobile phone tools software that comes with the phone that allows you to use segments of mp3 files as ringers, which saved me a lot of money (I usually buy them online) and enabled me to use whatever I want as a ringer. You can also upload pictures using the software, which was pretty useful and made for some cute wallpaper. More or less, it provided me with the style I wanted, and more features than I expected.Despite the fact that it was a great phone to begin with, I started having problems about three weeks into owning it. I would turn the phone on, and it would randomly dial numbers and then shut itself off. I thought perhaps I had dropped it or gotten it wet, but upon investigation, I found no sign that I had damaged it and had no knowledge of any accidents involving the phone. I was very worried that I'd just spent over 300 dollars on what would now be a very stylish paperweight, but I called Amazon's customer service and a very nice representative shipped me a replacement phone and labels to send my defective unit back with. I got the new phone, and everything has been going great so far, so I would just assume I got a defective phone to begin with. The only other flaw I can find with the RAZR is that it doesn't have great battery life, however, this isn't a huge issue, it just needs to be charged every day or two-- especially if you're constantly taking on it like I am.Overall, it is a great phone and more than I expected it to be. Amazon also went above and beyond my expectations to get my phone replaced as quickly as possible, and I am a very satsified customer. Plus, out of all the different phones I've had (probably 10 or more including other motorolas, nokias, samsung, etc.) this is by far my favorite.", "Date": "February 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!", "Author": "Rodney Kadlec", "ReviewID": "R30KD2T7XZX32Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THESE PHONES ARE NOT BUILT IN THE US.

Not only this but the screen would every so often show a blank white screen.  Furthermore, when making a call every time i bent over the signal would die.Now you may think that ok she's just got a defective phone but as i mentioned earlier this is my second phone.  Loving the look and convinced it was just that one, i purchased another one from the only store in the uk that sells them.

The immediate problem I had with this phone was when I went to hold it (hands free) between my ear and shoulder it was extremely difficult and uncomfortable.  You really couldn't used the phone that way for long without suffering a crick in your neck.  I know the old adage about not being too thin but if you are accustomed to propping the phone without an ear piece then you are likely going to be miserable with this phone and shouldn't buy it.  No wonder the phone manufacturer is pushing and bundling the bluetooth earpiece attachment because without it, forget it.  I also have some trouble using to the buttons for dialing the numbers since they are so flat and feel different that you are not sure you are hitting the number unless you watch the numbers appear in the window as you punch them.  There is also just the slightly longer pause let's say from the time you end or clear the last call and the time it takes for the phone to be ready to make the next one; if you start dialing the next call right away you may often find that the first number or two you pushed in the phone number didn't fully register so you need to start over the process of dialing the number again.  If you're used to quick, reliabile dialing it can be another aggravating aspect of using this phone.  Other than all that - it is a beautfiul, sleek, and sophisticated looking phone.  It feels slick and sleek in your hand, not like most phones. It is also a really good size.  I see many men especially having to go see-sawing the head from the ear to the speaker because some these new phones are so compact and tiny.  Size length is really the best on this phone above most all others and should be the industry standard for ease of hearing and speaking.

Also, there have been many times where I have plugged it in to charge, and the phone won't register that it's plugged in.  After 10 (overnight) hours of being plugged in to charge the phone will still register as dead battery.  There have also been times when the phone is not plugged in at all...but it will say 'charging battery' on the screen.  Those are not user errors!!!  I do really like the large color screen on the inside.  It does get dirty really easily though.  I am constantly cleaning both the screen and the numbers cause my makeup will rub onto it and it really holds onto fingerprints.  I live the camera feature.

If you want a smartphone, go get a bleeping smartphone. No, it doesn't have all the latest bells and whistles, but again, it's 5 bleeping years old, when it came out it had all the bells and whistles.That said, let's get to the actual review.It's fairly well built,the outer casing seems to be made of a mix of lightweight aircraft grade aluminum and high density plastic. The flip open bit works fine and there's minimal wiggle in the hinge. It's not milspec, so it's going to have some wiggle. That's a fact of life. Making things super precise costs super money. When this came out, yeah it cost super money but it had super tech.The keys are all flush with the body, they don't stick up, but they're reasonably large and light up for night use. The speaker on it's decent, and the ringtone I loaded (You need special software to do that, but it's easy to get) plays fine, though since this is the V1, it doesn't have much memory or a way to expand the memory, so whatever ringtone you pick is going to need to be either downgraded a bit in quality, or short. I went with both, and it's been fine. Not concert quality, but you don't need concert quality sound for a ringtone.The only problem I've had is the left side hinge plug. It occasionally starts to wiggle out a bit. It's not a huge problem though, just push it back in and keep an eye on it.I got this as a downgrade from my old smartphone and I'm glad I did. A smartphone, even the hunk of junk I had, was too much phone for my needs. Like using a bazooka on a fly. Sure it'll work but the word overkill comes to mind. This makes calls, receives calls, almost always has full bars, it cut my phone bill by more than half, and I can have the ringtone I want.

My previous RAZR would group all the phone numbers for one person in one entry and a quick navigation to the right would access additional phone numbers for that person.  When THIS phone sets up a second phone number for a person, it makes a completely new entry, so if one person has 5 different phone or fax numbers, their name shows up in the phone list FIVE TIMES! Also, when navigating to a person's name in the contact list, I used to be able to start spelling out their name and it would take me right to them.  On this phone, it only allows me to enter the FIRST letter of their name, and then I have to use navigation to scroll down through the complete list of people who's name starts with that letter -- A COMPLETE waste of time, especially when trying to shoot off a quick text message!

The screen is a nice size but the picture quality is awful. The zoom feature is nice but the pictures are still grainy even when totally still and at close range.  What pisses me off the most is that you can not down load your pictures from the phone without buying even more crap from Motorola.  When I got the phone, right away I took a bunch of pictures. When I got home I tried to download them from the phone with no success (no, I didn't read the manual very well the first day!). After literally 4 hours of BS on the phone and internet with Motorola Hildago support, they finally told me I had to spend another $35+ for the \"special software\" to download pictures (they didn't even know this when I first called so I wasted 4 hrs for nothing). Oh, and you need \"Their special cord\" or it wont work.  I tried 4 other cords and sure enough, the phone wont even register that they are plugged in. Tried the special Motorola cord and the phone finds the cord here and there but not all of the time. The company says the phone is not broken as the charger cords work but after almost 8 more hours of support calls to their \"tech support people\", they still can't figure it out so the pictures are stuck in the stupid phone and thats where they'll stay!  (the bluetooth transfer also has problems that tech support can't figure out) Also, for the price of this phone, the over priced software should come as part of the package!!! My husband has the Treo and he can just plug his memory card into the card reader to retrieve pictures. No additional cost!!!!  The reception quality is also nothing near what my previous Motorola flip had!(yes it was old but worked so well I wouldn't trade it until it died). Also with the Razr, If you don't have your ear in just the right place, you wont really hear your caller! The speaker phone is worthless while driving as the smallest bit of road noise makes it so your caller can't hear you!Besides the cool looks, this phone has nothing special to offer!!!", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Its a HOT pink phone but...", "Author": "Malachi J.
