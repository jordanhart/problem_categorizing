{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Unrooted Goodness", "Author": "Dads Dad \"RUPoed\"", "ReviewID": "R3CAZ9WUK0S2P3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been with MetroPCS for quite awhile and can say this device is it. Like everyone has said its fast, but the memory is what sold... Over 5 GIGS! Internal! I'm sorry but I had no idea how nice it is to have that with a dual core and 1gig of ram and ice cream sandwich! I had the HTC Wildfire S and this thing is like comparing a Prius to a BMW. I'm not sure if other owners know this but the LG system lets you DISABLE OR UNINSTALL BLOATWARE! (use the app 'Application Manager' to UNINSTALL APPS it keeps the apk on its own but not running means no update messages, TO DISABLE go to normal settings and 'Apps' find app open settings of it like you would to uninstall and it will say'Disable') Oh and you can screen capture with the already installed Quick Memo app. And the front facing camera is 1.3 MP which if pretty much the standard for the higher end phones also. Back lens is only 5 MP but it gets the job done. Both front and back work fast and clean, and it even does 1080p video... Not like my camcorder but impressive still.By the way it lasted me fine all day when I worked, hence not playing it solid hours on end, besides it seems to charge pretty quick regardless. This phone is all kinds of awesome in a small package.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "At last, a decent MetroPCS smartphone", "Author": "Sam I Am", "ReviewID": "R1AUM0WUIY259W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the LG connect, and what a waste that was. It was glitchy and wow, even tho at the time the reviews said it had the best battery life of the MetroPCS smartphones, wow, it was terrible. I had to use a battery saver app and buy extended life batteries. and still, it barely made it through a work day.The Motion is fantastic. It's a great phone. the Dual core processor keeps it moving super fast-- i'm playing an RPG video game on it, and can easily jump off the game to browse the web or use google maps with no slow downs. This phone also comes allowing you either uninstall or disable all the bloatware, without having to go through the headache of rooting it, so no more dealing with tons of app icons you never use.The battery life is great. Works about the same as any other phone I've had, as long as you are mindful of killing your tasks-- and it comes loaded with a task manager app that makes it easy to kill your running programs when you're not using them. I haven't even downloaded a battery saver app. Very intuitive interface.As just a phone, callers sound a little muffled, but nothing too bad. My friends sometimes have trouble hearing me, but it tends to be more the network, and not the phone. (\"you're breaking up\").So far, no glitches to report. I've had it about a month now. It pretty much just does what it should. And if you don't like something, there's always an app out there.Hands down, the best MetroPCS smartphone to come along. and it's totally affordable. The only real problems are ones that come with being on Metro-- service coverage isn't the best, (but hey, at literally a fraction of the price of Verizon, I'll take it), and Metro's 4g/LTE isn't as fast as Verizon's-- probably the service signal, frankly, but it's totally fast enough if you're not trying to win some webby award with your phone.If you're on Metro already and want a smartphone, buy this one while it's still cheap. And if you're not on Metro yet, then consider your pros and cons of leaving ATT/Verizon in terms of bells and whistles to cost value, and some minor inconvenience around signal issues, and let that be your deciding factor, because this phone is good enough to be comparable to most of the other android phones on other networks.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG Motion 4G", "Author": "Glyn", "ReviewID": "RQR7O8I1CQGSC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ensure you have 4G Metropcs coverage in your area before purchasing.  You can check this on the coverage map on their website, there is a list of cities in the bottom right hand corner at the time of writing.  In fact if you order from Amazon (not market place) they will cancel the order at checkout during the shipping address process if your address is not in one of these cities.  This device is also carrier locked so will not operate on any other network.This review was completed after applying the over-the-air software update from version (C to D).This runs on ICS 4.0.4 and is the same as every other phone with ICS.  Besides saying this is a general improvement over Gingerbread, theres no point in commenting on this operating system.  I will also not comment on the availability of rooting, custom recovery, bootloader unlocks, system restore facilities etc.  There appears to be less of a need for some of these in ICS.CPU/ OS performance/ Memory 5/5Excellent, dual-core processor (multi-task), lots of memory and fast in every respect - biggest selling point of this device and most important.  You can install and do whatever you wish with no lag.  I have noticed some rogue apps maxing out the processor occassionally but this can be caused by many factors.  You need to kill them if they do this ASAP, a maxed-out dual core processor will only drain the battery quickly and create lots of heat.Screen 3/5This has an IPS screen therefore it is rich in colors.  Its so rich that the lighter colors appeared a little washed or contrasty at first use.  In reality its simply displaying a wider color spectrum.  The screen is very responsive and smooth.Technically speaking it is a low resolution/ pixel per inch display but this is not noticeable.  The brightness toggle range isnt wide enough.  Its too bright in dark environments on the lowest setting and not bright enough outdoors on the highest setting.  Smaller is better with screen sizes but this screen is a tad too small for this spec.  This is most noticeable when typing in portrait, selecting text, or using the -+ buttons in maps.  Maybe a 3.7 or slightly larger screen would have been a wiser choice.Sensors 1/5Its difficult to swallow but this device does not have an ambient light sensor therefore the screens brightness will not adjust automatically.Even after the update, the orientation sensor sticks and spins in spatial apps e.g. Google Sky.  It is also inaccurate by a screens length and device movement isnt accurately represented in the app - oval instead of a circle.  This is coding not hardware related.  As a compass it works fine.Comms 5/5All work well on this device, also has WIFI-direct. I will not comment on 4G data performance as this varies due to a multitude of factors.Call Quality 4/5As there are many factors that influence this, im not going to comment on it via MetroPcs`s network.  When calling through Skype performance was acceptable whether using a headset, front speaker or speakerphone.  The speakerphone was a little weak though and better suited to quiet environments.  As the speaker is at the bottom it would probably be muffled if you were holding it in your hands.Audio/Video 4/5As the chips in this board are excellent,this device has no problems playing any videos.  Even though the sound level was not quite as good as beats audio on my Admire which maxed out at 85db, its a more than satisfactory 75db.  On the plus side theres a lower possibility of the speaker blowing.  As with all devices the speaker is on the back so expect some muffling depending in what surface it is placed on.  Headphone performance is exceptional (I use JVC) and will depend more on which brand youre using than anything else.  If you purchase three button iphone headphones, everything should work apart from the volume buttons.  Most if not all one button/ mic headphones should be compatible with this device, you can one click and multi-click (play/ pause/ forward track) without an app.  Use the Philips headset app to increase click functionality.  The advertised Dolby sound along with other effects can improve sound quality but only function through the headphones.Cameras/ Video 3/5Pictures and video taken during the daytime are more than acceptable.  The camera is quick and responsive and it records in HD.  Low light conditions can be rather challenging though as the sensor sometimes shows lots of noise while colors are often incorrect.  Manually altering white balance and flash settings can correct some of this.  In all fairness maybe they could have selected a better sensor and worked on the auto settings.  Its also not clear whether the geo location is ready or not as there is no icon.  The front camera is more than satisfactory for video calling/ facial recognition if lighting is adequate.  Go to google and type \"cnet review lg motion\" they too mention the camera noise issues.GPS 4.5/5This uses GPSONE 8+ with Glonass support (Russian system).  Its a preconfigured out of the box multi-moded system working in both network (only hot start) and standalone (Off-network) modes (Cold 20+ db, Warm 15-20+ db , Hot 10-15+ db with assistance).  It also has cache support and works in the range of 7-45 db in use.  The highest range for a portable device is about 6-50 db so you cant beat this performance.If you were to put this up against a Galaxy S3 this would beat it hands down.  In fact if you want a good GPS enabled device avoid Samsung all together.  They use their own single-moded firmware which isnt adjustable.GPSONE is the way to go.ConsTheres no AGPS for Glonass.  When warm starting in standalone mode, time to fix can be anywhere from 10 seconds to many minutes under the same conditions. Instead of a clear cache button, cache is lost on reboot.  There is no easy way of adjusting your AGPS settings.  I also noticed it sticking sometimes when using some 3rd party apps, this is most likely only a compatibility issue though.  Youll lose a few SNR/ DB if you have a case on. Last known good location/ coarse location is not available in between fixes or after reboots when using it in standalone (off-network) mode.If you wish to see a comparable LG device with GPSONE running goto Youtube and search for \"LG Optimus Elite - Virgin Mobile (full review)\" select \"mstechify\" review and navigate to 3 mins 15 seconds in the video.  This test is a hot start in network mode.Ports/ Buttons 1/5This definately has a custom board/design as it doesnt follow the standard layout for Qualcomm PCBs.The internally placed SD Card can be problematic if youre having difficulty with connecting and using it with a PC.  Even worse if you have a case on and have to continually pull it off to gain access to remove the SD Card.  At least they didnt place it behind the battery o).  Your views on this may vary depending on how you use the device and the PC youre connecting it to.It would have been nice if the up and down buttons changed tracks as with MIUI, this saves waking up the device.  This does not have a camera button as it has auto-zoom and the volume buttons act as a shutter.The Micro USB port on this device couldnt be in a worst position.  If youre a heavy user, youll often find yourself charging and holding it at the same time.  Therefore the cable is frequently moving with extra stress often placed on it as it rests against your hands.  Even without this, USB port failure appears to be one of the most common wear and tear failures on these devices.  The port should be where the power button is and more devices are now being designed in this way.  I have even seen cheap import phones with this layout.LED Light 4/5Even though it didnt appear bright enough for videos it was more than sufficient as a camera flash.  Although its a little too bright for those looking at it, the most useful function is as a flash light - power efficient too.Backup 4/5You can backup your data to the phone and some of it to Google.  I am not sure how transferrable this is to other devices though.Charging/ Battery life 4/5You can fast charge this with the wall socket or slow charge it through the computer. The USB cable could been a tad longer.A fully charged battery will last from as much as a few weeks down to a day depending on youre behaviour.  The biggest battery consumer is the IPS display.  If youre actively using  connections such as wifi/4g these will also use a lot.  The CPU will also use a lot too but only if it has a heavy load.An excellent feature of this device is that once the screen is turned off many other parts go into a sleep mode even if your playing music, saving lots of power.Internal Memory/ SD Card access via USB/Computer 1/5This is one of the worst proprietary systems I have used in several years. This review is the worse case scenario, i.e. your running Windows XP.  Functionality and reliability increases in Windows 7/8.Your drives are grouped virtually and not individually or logically on your computer.  With virtual drives you can do nothing more than view your files and copy data to and from them.  If you open or edit anything it has to copy (cache) to your computer first to open.  Not a problem with small files but try and open something large.  Functionality is increased in windows 7/8 but more restrictive in Windows XP.Virtual drives dont appear to apps on the PC so you cant select the drive or any of its files via an app.  You also cant fix the drive or obtain any property information about folders.  If your drives dont appear straight away its because with this system they have to be scanned before theyll display on your computer - be patient.Just to make matters worse performance and reliability varies from computer to computer and day to day.  We used it successfully one day while the following day we got it working just once and it was slower than USB1 speeds.  We gave up after a few hours.  Unfortunately its just luck whether you have success with performance or reliability with this system on your computer.A PC mag review of this device also revealed similar problems.  This can be found by typing 'PC Mag LG Motion review' in Google - its mentioned in the cons box and in the review itself.Overall 3/5Overall not a bad device for the price. Its certainly much better than my old Admire in many areas, but not all.  The Google (4/5) and Qualcomm (5/5) parts of this device appear pretty exceptional.  Unfortuntely LG appear to have made some poor decisions about software/ hardware and some aspects of the design (2/5). This somewhat makes it feel like an unrounded device, therefore overall it receives a 3/5.I would still recommend this as one of the best budget smartphones around at the moment but wouldnt shout about it.  Dont forget at this price point because its been heavily subsidised.  If youre just a caller and a texter, a 30 dollar device should suffice.With regards to smartphones in general, it still feels as if were 3-4 years away from mature products.  I actually had to copy this review out of a draft in the email app to a text file so I could edit it on an offline computer.  It took me an hour, it wouldnt select and copy it all in one go due to cache issues.  Then when I completed it manually, it wouldnt scroll down and the options would hang over the drag arrow, pretty lousy stuff from Google.Link to the review of my old phone.

Straight Talk's terms of service strictly prohibit streaming of audio and video.  If that's not a problem for you, it's a great deal, but let's face it, a smartphone begs to take advantage of these features.I purchased this phone and it is an amazing deal.  You get a great phone at a great price.  The phone has no lag at all and offers everything one could ask for in a compact package.  I have used phones with larger screens and was surprised at how satisfied I was with the size of this device.  It is compact, sleek and a joy to use.  In my experience, the battery life is excellent for a smartphone.  Also, the phone is easily upgraded with up to a 32 GB micro SD card.  The size of smartphones are getting out of hand; that's what tablets are for.Metro PCS call quality, texting and data exceeded my expectations.  The LTE data where available is more than fast enough to do whatever you need without any hiccups.  It is certainly faster than what I have experienced on Sprint, Virgin Mobile and Verizon's 3G networks.  Also, I have to say that Metro's customer service on the telephone have been top notch.If you have good coverage in your area of use, you can't go wrong with Metro PCS and the LG Motion.

When using for Skype it is really bad Quality but when just taking Pix or Cam it is nice. Over all I will give this Phone a 4 out of 5.

I am confident though that if their merger with T-Mobile goes through, it would be a win-win case for both customers and the merged companies.Now to the LG Motion 4G, Folks, let us learn to appreciate the valuable things that we hardly get from companies like MetroPCS. First, don't forget that the LG Motion is the first MetroPCS phone running Android 4.0.4 which means bloatware has naturally been taken care of in the OS. With just a few clicks, you'd have nothing to do with MetroPCS's JUNK apps. Second, the phone's specs are nothing short of a decent, modern handset. The 1.2GHz dual-core processor is snappy and crisp, 5MP camera with 1080p HD recording is pretty decent, 5 GB of internal memory is a perk, the 1700 mAh battery is highly competitive with the BIG guys that cost a fortune! And the last but not the least is the price of this device. $149 compared to the other guys with similar specs is just INSANE!Now to the NOT so GOOD: The display could have been better, but then again, something must be sacrificed for LG and MetroPCS to make a little profit. After all, the higher the display quality, the lesser the battery life!In conclusion, if you've had issues with MetroPCS in the past, now's a good time to reconsider them. If you're a respecter of VALUE and QUALITY, then hope that the T-Mobile/MetroPCS merger goes through.

The whole process of activating the phone and switching providers while keeping the same phone number went off without a hitch, and Metro has been excellent thus far.

I am sometimes resistant to new technology, but this is better and easier than a qwerty keyboard.  The touch screen is soo cool!  It's easy to use and has a longer battery life than my old phone, especially if just texting or making phone calls.  The battery does get used up faster if surfing the web.  But if you have a computer, you can easily just plug the phone into your computer, using the cord that comes with your phone.  It charges in full within a few to several hours.  It's easier to pull up websites and take pictures.  And this glass is stronger than regular glass, they call it Gorilla glass.  You can also download ringtones and wallpapers, much of them for free, because of the ice cream sandwich platform, which is google based.  The platform also makes it easier to use email such as hotmail, facebook, etc.  I got this at a discount of $80, due to a gift certificate, but it is about $149 regular price.

To solve this problem I bought a rubberized hardcase to protect this precious phone. The screen uses a very durable gorilla glass. The screen size is okay because it's about the size of an IPhone screen. The dual core processor in this phone is great, allowing you to multitask. There is very little wait time when you start this phone up. I can browse on Chrome and watch 1080p videos with little to NO lag, with the 4g lte. 4g lte is notorious for draining battery life. This battery drains fast. I personally love the front and back camera with LED flash. It's loaded with features that will keep you entertained for a while. The shutter speed is quick thanks to the dual core processor. This is the only Metro phone using Android Ice cream sandwich. In my opinion this is the most intuitive software android has ever made. The metro bloatware doesn't bother me because I can delete most of it. A simple restart solves any sort of loading problem it may have. Since I am on a budget I wouldn't dare drop this phone because from the outside it seems fragile, so I got the monthly $5 warranty. It's loaded with more features than I was expecting for the price, and all of them were done well.My Pros: the durable glass cover, fast browsing and download speeds (with 4G LTE), Camera and features, 1080p video, fun and easy to use ICS, Games have no lag.My Cons: battery life, no adobe flash support on android 4.0 and beyond, the back cover scratches easily.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the money.", "Author": "Roman", "ReviewID": "RBQEYJP09KJ8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's face it, $150 for this phone is a very good deal.

The 4g speed is good enough to steam slacker radio, tune-in radio, and pandora without any buffering everywhere I've been.  I can browse the web, use youtube, netflix, and view my webcams from home all very fast.  Overall I give this phone and the metropcs servce 5 stars.

I love it! For the price it's really unbelievable all of the things it can do and how fast and easy it is to use! The latest version of Android is very intuitive - this is my first android device. I have an ipad so when looking for a smartphone I considered that first. But the iphone is considerably more expensive overall- $100/mo data rate plan on most carriers. For $55/mo with Metro you pretty much get unlimited everything which is such a good deal.Now for the phone...right off the bat I synced my gmail and facebook contacts (facebook app is kind of slow, but still great on this phone). Very easy to join contacts if you have repetition across your google and facebook contacts. Very easy to look up contacts, dial numbers, put on speaker, access dialpad when talking. Easy to text & email. I love that you can flip the phone to make typing easier by gripping right side of the phone. It can be a little too sensitive but having a case helps with the sensitivity. You can flip phone over to silence incoming calls or alarm.There are so many great features on the actual calling aspect alone of this phone I could write two more paragraphs!Youtube is great, very fast and sound quality is amazing. Web browsing is great on google chrome and easy to switch between windows. I love the google maps and local feature, full with info and easy to navigate and pages load very fast.I absolutely love the visual voicemail feature Metro has though, it makes checking your voicemail easy! Other apps Metro put on it don't seem that great like the navigation. But with google its not necessary anyway.Battery does tend to go quickly. But so far has been able to last a whole day while watching 30 min of youtube, emailing, taking pics, browsing facebook. It charges very fast when off, less than an hour I think or a few hours (from 0% to 100% full) when on.So final word this is such a great smartphone. The price is great and so is Metro's data plan. Yes the screen resolution is not as sharp or the screen not as big compared to an iphone or galaxy, but I love that this fits easily in my hand and doesn't break the bank.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG Motion: Where value, features and portability come together.", "Author": "Dmitry Kristal", "ReviewID": "R14WELUIB5YW6N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Please note that I have been using iPhone 4(AT&T;) before switching to this phone.  This review is entirely based on that as I have not used any other iPhone higher than iPhone 4.The Good:*Price(Assuming you are not paying over $100)*Gorilla Glass(hard to break screen)*Dual Processor*Cheap Metro PCS plan*Icons provide more personalization than current iPhone*Very light and thin, which makes it possible using it one-handedThe Bad:*Talk and sound quality are average at best*Weak batteryThe Bottom Line:To save money, I had to say Good-Bye to my iPhone 4 from AT&T; and switch to MetroPCS.  I've cut my bill by about half and still received a phone that is decent alternative to iPhone.  My other option was to get LG Spirit, which is a bigger brother to LG Motion, but despite it's bigger size, it was more expensive and I found it difficult to use it one-handed.  There are some things that are better and some that are worse than iPhone 4's feature set.  Battery is disappointing, but you may upgrade it, as bigger batteries are widely-available.  Sony Music Unlimited app(I pay $1 a month) on Androidis better than Apple's app at this time, since on Android you may \"scrub\" music aka play it back and forth as oppose to current Apple's where you can only go to the beginning, so that was a plus for me as well.  iPhone had retina display and better pixels, but it did not have gorilla glass and was prone to being shattered if you dropped it.  Also this phone is cheaper to replace should something happen to it.  To each their own, but ultimately this phone was a good fit for me in the current situation.As far as MetroPCS being taken over by T-Mobile, do not let that scare you.  It will take about a couple of years until you will have to choose another phone, so your change will be natural if you get this phone now.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "fast ,great price .", "Author": "paulzpc", "ReviewID": "RJ79Q225U55ER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a better phone upgrade from the Samsung admire, with 5 gig of phone space I figured I can not go wrong, I was right,the phone also has a sims card ,I use Metro PCS and it is a crap service ,but this phone is amazing it picks up 4g in my area and boom you are blazing fast off and running I thought at first the 4G thing was a joke but trust me this phone and the 4G lite is amazing and fast, I like the easy apps and also the uninstalling of the bulk ware ..out of the box this phone jumped, I had a little trouble with hooking it up with Metro they asked me where I bought the phone ,after a few attempts I was on line and hooked up Facebook works fast even away from your home service router and I can play videos on YouTube without lag, for the money this phone in my opinion is definitely worth it", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "best budget ics phone out there", "Author": "al", "ReviewID": "R14VJDY3NAP784", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "for the price you aint getting better 1gb of ram 5 gb internal storage ICS 4g network for $55 a month cant beat that. when activating if you have an account you can do it thru their chat service online just have the numbers from the micro sim card and the imei number for the phone  handy.  there is also root no  for the phone so you can delete all the unwanted bloatware which is great for the price of the phone and the monthly bill you cant go wrong and yes customer service is dumb as rocks but if you can not get aggravated when calling the 1 or 2 times to get activated you'll be more than happy with what you paid for.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG puts things in Motion", "Author": "1Dub79", "ReviewID": "RS2FYDKJWFBYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After owning the Samsung Admire Prepaid Android Phone, Grey (MetroPCS) for almost a year, I figured I'd upgrade 4G style. I thought about purchasing the Coolpad Quatro , but it did not come with a lot of internal memory. Not to mention, it did not receive good reviews. However, I saw very good reviews on this website and on YT and decided to purchase. For you Android users, I'm going to minimize the basic features and get down to its primary features.CAMCORDER: The LG Motion also comes with a 1080p HD camcorder. Amazingly, it has many features as a basic camcorder, as well as a Dolby Surround sound option, during playback. Headphones must be used, though. After trying this, I must say that the resolution shows surprisingly good.CAMERA: The Motion's camera has a new front facing feature, which means pictures can be taken, while looking directly at the screen or taking pictures of something or someone. Not to mention, the camera is 5mp with an LED flash. The combination of both makes for outstanding pictures.FEATURES: The phone has Gorilla glass, which is very tough to scratch and break. This should be a very good feature for those of you, who are careless with phones. What's even better is it comes with a screen protector. I still recommend getting a hybrid plastic/rubber case for maximum protection.The LG Motion didn't get the name, just because. It comes with a quick 1.2 GHz dual core processor. This makes for very fast web browsing and non-buffering video watching. Each time I go to a website, I am just shocked at how fast the speed is. I also watched a movie on Netflix and I felt as if I was watching a hand-held HD tv. The resolution was second-to-none.Speaking of motion, this phone has some intriguing motion activated features. For example, if the alarm is set, no need to press a button for the snooze. Just turn the phone on its face and the snooze button is activated. Also, when browsing the web, the user can zoom in just by tilting the phone forward.ICE CREAM SANDWICH 4.0: This is just newest version of operating system of the Android phones. In a nutshell, the phone has features that the other Android phones have, except more enhanced customization for users, such as web browsing, emailing, texting/voice input, etc.IN-CALL POP-UPS/OPTIONS: I love the pop-up screens on this phone. For example, I can talk on the phone, and when I receive a text, the pop-up screen will show me the message and who it is from. Not to mention, I can respond to a text, while I'm talking. Of course, the pop-up can be disabled. Naturally, we talk with the phone to our faces. Well, I noticed the screen goes dark, when this happens. However, when I took my face a couple of inches away from the phone, the screen illuminated and I had the option to end the call, place on speaker, use the dial pad, Bluetooth, mute or go to contacts. On my previous phone, I had to tap on the screen and choose these options. Another cool in-call feature is the quick text for unwanted calls. For example, if someone calls and you can't or do not want to answer the phone, a quick text can't be sent. I saw one that said, \"I'll call you back in 15 minutes.\"INTERNAL MEMORY: The Motion comes with a whopping 5gb of memory. That is just phenomenal on its own. With that being said, I have downloaded several apps, pics, etc. I am STILL in the MB range, as far as used memory goes. Also, this camera can hold SD cards for up to 36 GB of memory. Wow!QUICK MEMO: This is one of the most unique features of the LG Motion. This can be accessed by using the pull-down notifications bar or pressing the up and down volume keys at the same time. Users can send memos via text message or email by the use of their finger on the background screen or choose the notepad screen. This feature can put a person in the mind frame of Windows Paint.For all of you 3G Android phone owners, if you want a fast and reliable phone to upgrade with, look no further than the LG Motion.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm the greatest!!", "Author": "urena bonitto", "ReviewID": "RSHXTHJO84C61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone was for my daughter.

Got it on Thursday which was a really fast delivery. Went right to my local MetroPCS ($40 monthly plan btw) and had it activated and my old number ported from NET10 which took less than 5 minutes. Awesome! I learned about the Android operating system and figured out most of what I needed to know for my needs.However... Later that night, I went to use it and it was completely, and I mean completely dead. Took out the battery, waited... Plugged in the charger... Nothing. Hmm.Now here I was with my new ported phone and it does not work. Well I had to buy one locally on Friday as this one has to go back. Otherwise I would have to wait for this return and a new one to come my way back from Amazon. All this time without a phone.Anyway... The new LG Motion 4G so far works beautifully. I sure hope it stays that way, as this phone is really a fantastic inexpensive smart phone that does everything well.The fact that the Amazon product failed is luck of the draw. It happens (hopefully just once in my case). I wanted to go with 5 stars but had to hold back because of the failure.The sound quality sounds great in my opinion. I recommend it -even with my problem.UPDATE:I so badly want to give this 5 if not 6 stars!Is it wrong to love a phone and great service from MetroPCS? 4G is great and defaults to wifi whenever possible.Also, kudos to Amazon which issued me a refund (although not recieved just yet) the day I dropped it off at my UPS center.

Once they merged with T-Mobile, I thought this would be a great thing.  However, the coverage is quite limited.  As long as I'm in a larger city in West Michigan (Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, Muskegon), I have decent 4G signal.  Ann Arbor and Western Detroit has 3G.  Leave Michigan, and you're lucky to have the Edge network.  Indianapolis - Edge.  Tucson and Phoenix - Edge.  SLOW SLOW SLOW.The display is nice, and the phone is small, making it easy to tuck into a pocket.  I did drop it once, onto a concrete floor, and nothing happened.  I had a cheap, 49 cent plastic case on it.  I was pleased that the screen didn't break.The bad:I purchased this phone TWICE from Amazon.  The first time, I wasn't able to activate it.  I signed up for a plan online, then attempted to activate by calling in through the phone.  It wouldn't work.  Finally it connected me to a customer service rep.  She asked me my name, couldn't find me in the system.  Asked me my phone number - which I didn't know, because I never got one.  Asked me the serial number of the phone, couldn't find it.  To get my money back, I had to file a dispute with the credit card company because MetroPCS had no record of me at all, even though they had charged my credit card. Returned the phone to Amazon and reordered another one a few days later (should have learned my lesson the first time).  Second phone: got it successfully activated, but never could get 4G service.  Went into a MetroPCS store, who entered the serial number into the system, and found that it was an illegally obtained phone!  I purchased it new from Amazon.  MetroPCS claimed it was a diverted phone, and was not supposed to be sold.  I purchased one from them directly, and returned the second phone to Amazon.The ugly:Battery life.  If I don't use the phone at all, I can get 4-6 hours out of a full charge before I have to plug it in.  If I use it for anything related to the internet, I get about 2 hours out of a full charge.The camera takes lousy pictures.  If you're more than 5 feet away from the object you're taking a picture of, it will turn out badly.  If you try to zoom in, forget it, the picture will be junk.  If you take a picture of the landscape and never look at it anywhere but on the phone, it will probably be ok.Sound quality is bad - either for playing a video or listening to music.  Don't even bother.  Use headphones if you must use it for that.Voice quality is horrid - people always complain when I call them on this phone.  I can't hear them well at all, and they say I sound like I'm in a vacuum.It's really too bad - I wanted to like this phone, but I can't.  I spent $150 for it when it was quite new to the market, and I see that was wasted money.  Maybe I can use it as an ipod or something.  I suspect not - when I first got it, it wouldn't do anything until I activated the service.  Oh well.  Sprint offered me $10 to sell it to them... maybe I should take it and cut my losses.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best bang for your buck 4G pre-paid phone on the market.", "Author": "P. Peters", "ReviewID": "R3EH47HR6GDS75", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the LG Motion back in October and it is a great phone.Although the specs list the CPU at 1.2GHz, it actually benchmarks at 1.5GHz and rivals far more expensive phones in Quadrant testing.1GB of RAM5GB or ROM (Internal Storage) + a provision for a 32 GB Micro SD card.4G LTE which gives me D/L speeds of around 7.x MBPSInexpensive, easy to replace batteryLightning fast phone.5 MP Still and Video camera with LED FlashThe pics look a little off-color when viewed on the phone, but once transferred to your PC they look fine.This phone is packed with features and you can remove the \"Bloatware\" that Metro PCS puts on the phone.Millions of Apps in the App StoreNo having to use that awful \"iTunes\" app either.For the price, you will not find a better phone. Period. End of Story.I liked mine so much that I have since upgraded to an LG Spirit which has a few enhancements plus a 4.5\" screen, but it is far more costly, but is basically the same phone, but with a bigger screen.If you are looking for a great, fast, inexpensive phone then look no further than the LG Motion.The only cons are the 3.5\" screen and the screen res. isn't on par with expensive phones like the Sammy S-3, but for less than $100.00, it's a flat-out steal.Get it and you will love it as I did mine and still do, but my old eyes need a bigger screen so I had to upgrade to a larger screen at a higher cost and ordered the LG Spirit.I can't think of a single thing about this phone I don't like. Battery life is fine if you don't have a bunch of features running simultaneously like WiFi and Data, as there is an option to auto-switch to Data if WiFi isn't available for example.I charge my phone overnight, listen to music all day at work with my vast music library on a Micro SD card (Something you can't do with an iPhone) watch a few YouTube vids, make/take phone calls and maybe even take a few pics or vids and my battery will last the entire day.A spare battery is less than $20.00, so it's affordable to carry a charged spare, keep one at work or just plug the phone in if you are going to use it in an environment that has an electrical outlet. I have a charger at Home and one at Work so I don't have to lug around my charger and losing it would make it harder to charge my phone, although I have a USB cord to charge via my PCThe 1700 mAh battery should be more than enough if you turn off extraneous features that you won't/aren't using and should get you thru an 8 AM to 11 PM day as long as you turn off features you aren't using anyways.Like I said, best bang for your buck smart phone on the market.I bought mine when Metro was having a promotion, so I pay just $30.00 a month for Unlimited Calls and Texts, plus 250 GB of Data. Since I have WiFi at Home, Work and even on the Bus to and from Work I rarely go over my Data limit and if I do, Metro doesn't charge me extra. They just throttle your Data speed down to 3G which is still fast enough for audio & video streaming.I dumped my iPhone 4S along with the expensive contract that came with it that I was handcuffed to once my contract expired.I'm now saving over $500.00 a year and I own the phone and not the carrier, so I can sell it and upgrade to a different phone if I like, which is what I'm in the process of doing. With the $50.00 a month I'm saving by switching to Metro, the extra money in my pocket makes it easy to upgrade to a better phone and/or spend it on other things then paying $80.00 a month to a contract carrier just to use a cell phone.Metro - $1.00 per dayAT&T; - $2.67 per dayMonth-to-Month is the future of the industry and contracts are expensive and keep you handcuffed and locked in for two-years. No Thanks.BTW, Metro will be merging with T-Mobile this year and T-Mobile is planning on spending 5 Billion on upgrades, although the Metro PCS service is great as I never run into \"dead spots\" or have dropped calls like I did with AT&T; and the monthly cost will not change and Metro PCS users will have more phone choices as well, as well as increased coverage areas although I've never had a problem with lack of signal.Win/winGreat job LG and Metro PCS!", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied with the lg motion!", "Author": "Ernesto Dc Silva", "ReviewID": "R3C0ULJBBE9S3W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for 2 weeks now on the metro PCs prepaid plan.I've got to say I'm very satisfied with the purchase so far.

The Motion 4G is DEFINITELY the best/most smartphone you can get for this amount of money. There isn't anything out there that even comes close.  The processor is fast enough to handle even the toughest of multitasking, and it's got enough RAM to run all of your apps at once without ever having to \"auto-kill\" anything to stay snappy.  It's an A+ phone.  My only let down with this phone: the fact that since T-Mobile and Metro merged, this phone (as it is CDMA, and Metro is switching over to the T-Mo GSM Only network structure) will no longer be supported as of 2015.  That still gives you plenty of time to enjoy this awesome phone without having to fork over all that much of your hard earned cash.The other thing that people really concern themselves with, and I am in this category, is development.  With Android being FULLY customizable to your EXACT tastes and specifications, through rooting, people usually want to make sure they are getting a phone with a thriving development community, so they can tweak and change their phone as often as they'd like.  Well, that is one thing that the Motion has that many of the other cheaper smartphones don't; development.  And lots of it.  AndroidForums has a very active Motion 4G community, with plenty of different ROMs, ports, and add-ons.  Also, the root method is simple.  A piece of cake.  And while the Motion 4G has a \"locked\" bootloader (disabling mods and carrier unlocking) the bootloader has since been patched with an exploit known as \"Loki\", allowing Motion 4G owners to bypass the security checks in the kernel, and do whatever they'd like to their phones.All in all, this phone is a ten out of ten.  It has everything you would want: speed, memory, and development.

I have a 32 GB microSD card in it (bought $20 here on Amazon) so I won't have to worry about its limited 5GB available memory (which I use it mostly for apps).  Anyway, here are what I like and don't like about this phone.What I like- Great value: you can't beat paying $50 for a 4G phone with no contract.- Good performance - thanks to it's dual core processor (1.2 GHz).- Android 4.0 - many of the Metro's phone are still running the older ginger-bread OS (at a higher price)- Accepts microSD cards - I use the 32 GB card but I hear it also accepts 64 GB microSD card as well.- Good battery life - it lasted 2X more when compared to my work phone (Samsung Galaxy S3).- Front facing camera - great for Skype- Very compact & light (fairly thin as well).What I don't like- Low resolution screen - it's only 480-by-320-pixel resolution- No HDMI connection- lots of Metro's bloatware apps but that's with all Metro phones.- Speakerphone is weak so don't count on using it much for conference calls.- As with all Metro phones, you won't be able to upgrade the OS (unless you root it).All in all, its the best Metro phone for the money.

They are the new guys around here! But. Seeing as the month to month plans need you to pay FULL price for your cell up front to get started. I figured buy a used, in great condition unlocked cell to start. And, one on the upper end. No, it may not be an S3-4. But, Ya get my point. It also is not a $39.99 Slide cell either. Anyhow.

First, if you do buy this phone, be aware: Not all models have a SIM Card.  Mine does not have one, and my daughter's does. I thought she was fortunate until she told me, and I later read, of the problem removing it and the warnings about  possible related loss or damage to your data if you remove it and ... she did lose all her pictures after removing it.  I sent her those she had sent me, so some were restored to her phone.Regarding functionality:  I was very happy with it until I discovered I was not receiving any notice of phone messages. I had missed messages anywhere from 3 days to 7 days!  My daughter texts, so hearing from her was not a problem.I was already accustomed to the phone and its many excellent features.  To give a well-rounded review, I should include what I do like very much about the phone, not just the glitches.  The internet access is lickity-split, fast as lighting.  The email comes in very well and is easy to handle. The resolution for reading, or looking at pictures on YouTube and other videos, is clear as a bell.  I read a great deal on this phone, and listen to radio podcasts that it provides off the internet, and that is of very clear sound, and it recharges very quickly.When I went into MetroPCS  describing the problem of not getting notice of phone messages, I asked them to phone me and leave a message.  An alert came up, but I deliberately did not respond or use any function of the phone.  The alert remained in view for only one hour!  When I searched the internet, I found this problem was common enough to be written about.A problem that began in the past three months:  The talk-to-text function, which had been very good, has become very frustrating. Granted, it did better when I talked-to-text directly from MetroPCS, which seemed to indicate the problem was specific to my house. However, it had never happened all those months before.  In addition, it happened to my daughter as well, and she lives in another part of town.Another problem that began in the past three months:  We have to push \"Done\" after speaking a few words, and the last word will be left off until we push \"Done\".  If you're not already OCD, this will make you so!  What's even stranger is, the talk-to-text does much better in the morning (like me!).  Now I'm thinking \"Twilight Zone\".Here's something else:  Now when we send a message, it shows \"Sent\" but the identical message pops onto the messaging screen as if it had not been sent.  We now have to erase the duplicate or let it get tacked in front of the new message (annoying for the receiver). To get around it, I insert a character  onto the new message screen immediately after sending the message.  This phone has got me trained!A small issue for me, but possibly important for people in business or who own a business, you should be able to \"Group\" your contacts, but I tried it on two and could not make any changes, not even deletions.  It does well on \"Search\", and that would be one way around it, but grouping is a pretty nice and quick feature if it works!Trying to reach LG was of no use. The recording told me that if I would wait an hour or more, they could probably get to me.

I have downloaded Hulu Plus, Netflix, and Amazon apps for watching videos and I never have a problem with playback even without a wifi connection. I am very pleased with the phone and the monthly bill.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Phone is the Greatest!", "Author": "Akaydot50 \"K\"", "ReviewID": "R27R810RBLODBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I live on my phone so I was excited to get my first Android.

I need more minutes.  The plan most suitable for my use is Metropcs, the $30 plan, unlimited messages, talk and 250k of 4g data. The phone selection with Metropcs had some reasonable priced phone, but the OS used in these phones is Gingerbread, quite old in my opinion.  When I came across the LG Motion 4g LTE running Ice Cream at $150, the phone is within my budget and the operating system is close to what I wanted.  My goal was to have the new phone operating on Jelly Bean, but I didn't want to pay %400 or more for the phone.  I have used the LG Nexus 4 for a while so I am spoiled by the use of Nexus.  With Jelly Bean, I don't need to type my emails, messages, or searches as the phone is able translate my voice to texts quite well. The LG Motion after a little training of my voice, I am able to do most tasks with the LG Motion. Asking a voice question on Jelly Bean, I would hear a voice response from the phone.  On the LG Motion, I had to read the response. The voice recognition is on par with LG Nexus.Many reviews of the LG Motion, stated their calls are not clear.  I am able to hear the other party quite clearly on my calls.  So on voice, I am most satisfied about this function on the phone.  The size of the phone is about right for phone calls. On battery life, with just a few messages and emails, 40 minutes of talk, and cleaning up apps and re-install of apps, I still have had 71% of battery charge remaining at the end of the day.  I had a battery app installed with an aggressive setting, lowered the screen brightness to 25% and disabled WiFi and data when not needed. On initialing a call, the sound of the ring of the other party is not a pleasant sound. I use my cell phone to make phone calls, messages, short emails, find my car, look for place to have a bit to eat, finding my ways to and from, weather, traffic, time of cities and countries, where friends live. So the LG Motion screen size is just fine for my needs.  For reading news and articles, researching and purchasing, I use my large 24\" Elo touchscreen monitor with a small form computer to perform these tasks.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone is great,  Metro's other stuff just meh!", "Author": "M.

Should have stayed with the older phone, with the 4G I am always getting throttled speeds or roaming at various places I work. This phone is really great, to bad someone else (another service) didn't put it on their network. I guess I am one of the unlucky ones to get stuck with less then decent service. When T-Mobile takes over maybe the spotted roaming and throttling will stop.Update: The speech to text is even worse. The phone does not process the action, MetroPCS's server does which is then sent over the carrier services. If you have a poor connection, spotty service or none you will ether get silly conversions of \"Good Morning, how are you\" to \"Gold corns, halo'balo\" or a notice of \"Unable to connect to server\". Another frustration is when the speech convertor system shows \"Getting ready\", I guess it has to do with the spotty service.Update 2: Into second month and still not much improvement. I think in one more month the issues of dropped calls, loss of connection for data and delayed IM's and email will result in looking for another carrier. As I stated before from 3G to 4G and it all went to hell. Sorry MetroPCS, you lost a lot of customers when you signed the deal with T-Mobile. You are loosing another one soon because you can't perform like T-Mobile (yet). Would knock it DOWN another star is I could.Update 3: Well, we are done with MetroPCS(POS) as of March 2013. The continuing \"a network error occurred\", \"data lost\", \"no connection available\", \"unable to connect via server\" on and on and on... Phone calls OK, everything else is just useless. The saying modified - you do NOT get what you think you are paying for. To add insult to lack of service their tech support are idiots! Things like \"You must have done something to your settings\" or \"I think you need to reset your phone\" are canned responses by people sitting in cubicles in cheap labor of the Metro Empire. UGH!Good bye MetroPOS. I am NOT one of the lucky ones to have a phone with you...Strikes:1.  4G spotty2.  4G is throttled at times3.  Speech to text is a crap shoot4.

The one thing that frustrates me a lot is how quickly the battery drains.  I don't know if I have a bad phone or what.  I've had it for about six weeks and I had to buy an extended battery for it just to make it through a whole day.I usually put the phone on the charger when I go to bed at 11:pm so it charges overnight.  When I am ready to leave the house in the morning 7:30 I'll pull it off the charger and have the phone with me, but I don't actively use it.  I'll get maybe one or two calls a day - most of which are brief, so it's not the talk time that's killing the battery.  I don't spend a lot of time texting or using apps.  I have the Wi-Fi and GPS turned off to conserve battery.  Despite that, around 5:pm I'd get the signal to plug it in if I was using the standard battery.  With the extended battery it's much better, but also much bulkier and I had to improvise on a case by cutting vents into a cheap silicone case to accommodate the battery bulge of the thicker extended battery.Bottom line...  it's a good phone but unless my phone is defective and unique, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't have frequent access to a charger.

Remember you get what you pay for. but at 150$ AND the 30$ a month unlimited (almost) everything plan(4g speed of up to 250 mb. do not use a radio app as you can use that up in an entire day.) when i have it in my hand people think it's an iphone 4s. that's about the size of it. i like the flash for the camera but it can get a little too bright in dark lighting. at full volume when playing music, the battery gets to 15% after about 9 hours of music play. the 5gb internal storage is pretty good, but i recommend getting a 16 or 32 gb if you're a gamer or have lots of videos you'd like to take with you. Call quality is amazing. Since i don't have FaceTime, i have the yahoo messenger app along with the video calling plugin. i just wish there was more content to the google play store. yes, it's pretty good for an android that can play almost all video games on the play store. all of the apps run smoothly. i'm happy with my phone. task manager and app manager help a lot, too, for killing apps that run in the backround. i love this phone. it's my first android on my budget. maybe i will upgrade to the samsung s3 for the screen size. i give it 5 stars for my first android phone. good luck. and do more research before you decide on investing on a pricey phone.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this phone!", "Author": "Poohbear", "ReviewID": "RQOKIW3Z09S0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been meaning to switch to Metro PCS, but dreaded a few things, such as bad customer service, not so nice phones...etc..etc.  But I'd been paying $70/month with Sprint for pretty much the same thing I can get from Metro, so when my coworker made the switch.  I decided to research good phones from Metro and looked here and found great reviews for this LG Motion.  And with their super cheap $30/month (available in store only, the cheapest plan online is $40) for everything plan, that's a huge savings of $40/month, just by switching.  The cost of $149 for the phone will pay for itself in less than 4 months of savings.  Now I got a phone with great Navi feature (which is a must for me), got the Facebook working, had a hard time connecting using the FB/Twitter/IM app combo, so I googled and found that just going to facebook.com, I was able to download fast and set up my FB up and running.  Oh, did I mention that this is my first smartphone ever and also my first prepaid cellphone??!!  So far so good, I would have paid something similar with Iphone, but dreaded the high cost of available plans with those carriers with 2 yr contracts.  Now, I have a great new phone, \"love the voice to text feature!\", cheapest plan ever and hopefully I won't ever have to deal with customer service people, with this great new phone, I'm thinking it would be a long while, if I ever need to speak with someone.

Not tech savvy but here's my input:Pros:- cheap, looks great, does its job well (used it for calling, texting, schedule planning, and rarely the internet).- plays games and music apps well.Cons:- battery life is sub-par, I live in an area with coverage near an area without coverage, and going into buildings would quickly drain my battery.- Battery occasionally overheats to dangerous temperatures: I've had it in my pocket only to feel it burning my skin, grabbing it and immediately taking out the battery (which was too friggen hot to touch). Battery overheating happened multiple times, but only 4 times where the phone hurt to touch, only this morning seemed to be its final time.- software issues:1) Had this weird issue where if an unknown number would call me, it would first show up (as the person is calling) as one of my friends from high school who occasionally visits. I would answer it, expecting to hear from him, only to find telemarketers or wrong numbers. Have learned to just not pick up the phone when that one person seems to be calling and told him to communicate with me via other methods..2) 90% my second most called number would not work, I would call them only to hear the \"busy\" dial tone. Would call using someone else's LG Motion on Metro PCS and it would work no problem. Checked to see if maybe they accidentally blocked my number, but that was not the case. Issue is still unknown.TL;DR-  Great for price and basic internet browsing, GPS, scheduling, etc. Some wonky software issues that MetroPCS couldn't help with that were irritating. Huge issue with battery overheating (with little to no programs running) in pocket during day and while charging (eventually led to phone's death), Great temporary or basic phone, but would upgrade instead of buying again.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "awsome phone", "Author": "Ayrianna", "ReviewID": "R1F4QL2N7OTDQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is great! im dooo glad i purchased it. i would recommend it to anyone. love love love it", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "You can't go wrong with LG", "Author": "Mandy K", "ReviewID": "R2RUQSPJC9LJ3F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone.I love it so much I ordered 2 more for my husband and daughter.No complaints.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice phone better price", "Author": "Angel Faith", "ReviewID": "RTWJUTN33CVK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great 4g phone to pop your 4g cherry with because it offers all the elements needed for a basic user, and as always android customization is AMAZING.I bought this phone for my husband to use when needed, he mostly listens to and downloads music from the phone or watches our tv player app. The main thing I was concerned about it for his large hands to easily be able to maneuver.
