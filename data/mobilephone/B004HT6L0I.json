{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bad Buy", "Author": "K. Greenbecker \"Smart Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R1LWKBK31O4B4G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone has a major flaw. If you let the battery die it will most likely be unable to charge unless you buy a new battery. You will have to charge the phone almost everyday if not everyday to make sure it doesn't shut down on you. the front gets easy banged up as well. The scroll feature is backward to everything else out on the market so it takes getting used to. The buttons are very small so unless you have tiny fingers you'll have a problem. Also the lock function is easily unset. My phone tries to connect to the internet in my bag all the time. I would not recommend this phone. Spend a little more and get something better.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's okay...", "Author": "Cryssy Eloise", "ReviewID": "R1XZ7TBMIZDE4D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "From my experience the Pantech Jest is a \"you get what you pay for\" type of phone. I love the sleek style and the fact that it is small. I've gotten many compliments on it. This phone is basic, so it is a good purchase if that is what you are looking for. It has good speakers and you can hear the other person you speak with clearly. I haven't had any problems with the battery. I can easily get a decent few hours talking if charged completely.The only real problem that I have had with this phone, that has driven me absolutely crazy and makes me want to throw it out of the window sometimes, is the music player. The music player freezes up all the time and there is nothing you can do about it, but take the battery out. I don't bother with it half the time.Also, becareful with text messaging! I like the test messaging format and the keyboard, but if you are not careful, your message to someone can easily be sent to another person if you have more than one person in your messaging box. Just a tiny flick of your finger left or right on the optical touch keypad can change the recipient. Yes, that has happened to me plenty of times... Now I am more careful.Overall, I would say for the price it is a decent phone, but can easily be a disappointment if you expect more from it. And it would be a great phone if not for the ever freezing music player and 2mm headphone jack. Also, the screen can easily be scratched so it will be good to keep it protected.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "waste of money and time :=(", "Author": "Cell user", "ReviewID": "RHASREV6AK7BZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone is a pretty much basic cell phone, which is all I need, but I do need one that will work. I had to replace this phone 7 or 8 times in one year! The screen freezes up alot, and the only thing to do is remove the battery, no buttons will work. I also dont like that if I'm texting and another message comes through it basically takes over, and if I'm not careful I will lose my message I'm texting. I do love the design of the phone, although it's nothing spectacular. :=/", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "horrible battery", "Author": "lindsay m", "ReviewID": "R168XOR2FBX116", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i had this phone for about 6 months before it stopped working, a friend told me it was most likely the battery because the phone would work while plugged in. i bought a new battery through amazon and it lasted a little longer than the last but it is ridiculous to have had to replace it in the first place. other cons about this phone is the small keyboard, unless you are a teenage girl or someone with small fingers it is diffucult to text. my camera no longer works because it got scratched from everyday use because it isn't hollowed into the phone. the only 2 things i like about this phone are the mp3 player and the full keyboard.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "not a unlocked phone", "Author": "daniel goeins", "ReviewID": "R3M2EI80DW4R5C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the phone was to be unlocked so when I got the phone it was locked and had to send it back", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Little Phone", "Author": "T-J", "ReviewID": "RIKR0PULYLN2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The \"Touch\" is not so good on this phone.
