{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Another Great Blu Phone", "Author": "Texas Electronics", "ReviewID": "R3MKDUPCVAAV0N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did have a Blu Quattro 5.7 but after 2 weeks the ear speaker went out. I returned it and got this one. I was hesitant since there is no Micro SD Card slot. However, I am using Google Drive and storing all my files and music on there.In the box was: The phone, earbuds with several size buds,instructions, charger and USB cable, screen protector, and a cover. This is one of the first unlocked phones that I got from Amazon that the box seal wasn't broken.Its very sturdy and fits nicely in the hand. I love the fact that it has Gorilla Glass.The phone as a great camera. Its a huge improvement over the camera on the Quattro. I also love the updates to the Android OS. It is smooth and very responsive. I like how you can setup the security to use your face to unlock the phone or a phrase.I installed a couple of programs that you might want to check out (free):1. Advanced Task Manager. This kills running programs and frees up the phone memory.2. Open Mic+. I'm experiment with this. Its an add on for Google+ so that you can do hands free voice commands. Similar to MotoX3. Clean Master. This will automatically tell you when to move installed programs from the phone memory to the larger section of the phone memory. It also cleans up the storage and gets rid of junk files. Very good program!On most of the Blu phones, they state that there is an FM radio. I've had the Blu 4.5 Quattro, 5.7 Quattro, and this phone. This is the only one though were I found the FM radio. It is great reception! You must use the earbuds in order for it to work. I suspect because they act as the antenna.The phone network speeds on this phone is improved over the 4.5 and 5.7 Quattro, due to improve protocol.Things I dislike about the phone:1. No Micro SD Card slot (No biggie since I am using Google Drive).2. They divide the phone memory into two partitions. A .99gb and a 12.83gb partition. The main partition is the .99gb one. I have tried to figure out how to combine them but have been unable to yet. I don't know why Blu does this. You have to carefully manage your installed apps or you will quickly run out of room. That's why I recommend Clean Master.3. The battery can not be removed. I guess that once the battery dies,you have to contact Blu to see about them replacing it or you just throw it away.4. The screen dims automatically after about 15 seconds. I have tried every setting and every program on the Play Store to prevent this. Nothing works. You must constantly touch the screen to keep it at full brightness. I don't know if its a Jelly Bean thing to save battery life or a Blu hardware setting. It's annoying but I've gotten used to it. Note: It won't dim while watching a video.5. Blu still hasn't come out with any cases for their phones!!!!! COME ON BLU!!!!Overall, a great phone. I think it's the best Blu phone that I've tried so far.I found a great case on Amazon....http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J53YW16/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1It is soft rubber and wraps around the back of the phone and the front edges.Also found some great screen protectors for it here on Amazon.....http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJHPMHC/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1Just follow the instructions. I installed mine with no bubbles and fingerprints don't show up that easily.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Life view review", "Author": "Jen C.", "ReviewID": "R1ZSZLEQ8PV8YB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I buy stuff on Amazon all the time and never write reviews. I wanted to write a review for this phone because there really isn't that much quality feedback in regards to this device. I actually purchased this phone after returning an s4 due to it being way to expensive and before that I was using an s2. I have been very used to the Samsung interface. The blu phones are definitely more simple or \"stock\" android which is an adjustment from a galaxy experience. I do like the phone. It looks very cool and impressive. The screen is huge and bright. Surfing the web and watching videos is awesome on this thing. I am using a Walmart family mobile (tmobile) sim card and it worked immediately with no issues and i mostly get the hspa signal so it is pretty snappy with the internet.The phone feels sturdy in hand with some weight to it. The specs are pretty decent for the price. The speakers are OK. Camera is nice. I'm not a huge picture taker but it is nicer than what I need I suppose.My only concern at this point is maybe the call quality. I have been told twice that my voice went out for a moment. I am not sure if I was not talking into the mic or a signal issue. I will give it a bit of time to find out. I know the lack of sd support has people all worked up but I don't use many apps and I keep my music in my Amazon cloud anyway so that is not a deal breaker. 16 gb is more than enough for my needs. all in all I am pretty pleased with the phone. It is pretty fast. Nice sturdy build quality. Updated android experience. It is no s4 but then again i didn't use half of those features and it is half the price without contract. I bought mine at best buy so I could return it if I wasn't satisfied. But I think I am going to keep it. I would recommend this phone to someone looking for decent phablet at a reasonable price off contract.Update 9/28/13So I absolutely love the Life View. It is fast beautiful, and everyone stops me to find out what phone I am using. A few days ago I decided i would like to pair the phone with my LG sound bar to listen to some music. I try pairing and the phone cannot find my sound bar. I then try to pair it with my S2 and my macbook pro and still nothing. Then phone cannot discover and is undiscoverable. I then take it to Best Buy and do trouble shooting with the Geek Squad  and they confirmed the Bluetooth was bad. They returned my phone and are ordering me new device. I will see if maybe that was a faulty phone and will update my review accordingly.Update 10/27/13So my replacement device works great. The Bluetooth pairs with no issue so that's good and it's over all a pretty good device. The only thing that is kind of a bummer is there are no silicone cases that I can find.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone ... but the Auto Dim feature makes it almost unusable.", "Author": "WA Online Shopper", "ReviewID": "R13O5O7KOEGEHY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a really good phone for the most part. Huge clear screen and very snappy. I was very happy with this phone until .... I tried to read a long web page with it.As someone else mentioned the display has a particular annoying behavior were it dims after 5 seconds. When I first noticed this I thought no problem, it's an Android, I can update the screen timeout settings. I soon came to find that the Display Settings are a little different from my Galaxy S2. Different in that there is no way to disable the screen dim timeout. Even if I could increase the timeout to 5 minutes or something the issue would be hugely mitigated. But there is nothing. I tried a lot of apps from Google Play to see if this is something that could fix it but none of them worked.I contacted Customer Support who informed me there is no way to adjust this feature. I made the decision at that point that I could not live with it and returned the phone today.Everything else with the phone is great. Maybe an SD card, but I hardly even used my SD Card on other phones I doubt I would need it for this. I am going to award the phone 3 stars as it is practically all good but I down rate it so drastically by two stars just for the fact that I cannot adjust something so simple and it is something that affects (for me) the usability so greatly.Another issue that may be a problem for some is that there is not a huge market for any accessories for this phone. I recommend you try searching for the Canvas Doodle 2 or the MyPhone Iceberg. These are other marketing names for this phones in countries other than the US.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone But Some Quirks", "Author": "Matthew Fisher", "ReviewID": "R33LSHPP0D1JGB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After using this phone for about two weeks now I can say that I really like this phone but there are a few quirks.  First off the price of this phone is outstanding for what you get.  We bought my brother-in-law a Blu Studio 5.0s a few months ago, and i played with it for a little while and was impressed with the screen and snappiness of it.  I laid it down side by side next to my Note 2 and couldn't tell the difference in speediness between the two.  This being said I decided to drop Sprint as my carrier and pick up the Life View to test out the different pre-paid carriers.The first thing you notice about the Life View if the brightness and clarity of the screen.  Top notch and just as good as my note 2.  Also the processor is amazing and very quick and responsive!  Yes it has a Mediatek quad core processor and most tech geeks scoff at the mention of mediatek, but after using the Life View I don't get the fuss about it.  It is fast, responsive, and plays all the 3D games you want to throw at it with no lag.  The processor should absolutely not be a dealbreaker.The camera on this thing is a 12 MP camera.  It shoots amazing photos and crisp clear HD video.  Pictures are just as good if not better than my note 2.Call quality is clear and I have no problem connecting to wifi or blu-tooth in my car stereo.  Also I really like the version of Android running on it.  It doesn't have all the bloatware that my note 2 has but still contains many of the gesture features that my Samsung has.  Blu has also announced they will be upgrading to Kit Kit in the second quarter of 2014 as well.All this being said there are a couple of quirks to this phone that prevent it from getting that elusive 5th star.  First off there is no SD card slot.  This shouldn't be a huge issue since all my music and videos are stored on the cloud, but what puzzles me is why the main partition is only 1 gig and the storage contains the rest of the 16 gigs of this phone.  When you install apps they go to the 1 gig partition, and considering the size of some of the apps out today, this fills up very quickly so you have to manually move them to the other partition.  The ones you can move anyways.  About half the apps I have on my phone cannot be moved without rooting the phone and forcing the move.  And when you do move them over you lose widget function for that app.  Blu this needs to be addressed in your upcoming update.Another quirk of the Life View is the screen dims WAY too fast and cannot be adjusted.  There is no way to correct this.  If you are reading a webpage and count to 9 it dims.  Very annoying!  Again Blu please fix this in an update.The last negative about this othwise amazing phone is that there is no LTE.  All the prepaids are now offering LTE so it's time to catch up Blu.  It does connect just fine to ATT and Tmobile HSPA+ and I get about 3-6 MBs per second download which is fine for web browsing and the like, but makes playing youtube videos in HD impossible.  However once it's connected to my home wifi netflix and youtube stream very well in HD and the outstanding display on this phone really stands out.Final Conclusion:  The Blu Life View is a great bargain for the price and if you don't need LTE or live in an area without it I highly recommend this phone!", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone, Highly recommended", "Author": "George Sizemore", "ReviewID": "R1NDJHUPEQGCRZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone a little better than a month ago, so far this phone has been an excellent value. It is just a little bit smaller than the Samsung galaxy Mega. The screen is very clear, it's fast. The phone doesn't come with a bunch of Bloatware, nnice clean rom. The only drawbacks about the phone is that it doesn't have an SD card slot, all the memory is built in. And there are no accessories for it (Cases, Zagg.....)You tube vids look excellent, the sound is loud and clear, I ha e no problem with Facebook, It doesn't play well older apps (some of them)I've already rooted this phone (oops, there goes the warranty), but oh well, it is a versatile phone well worth the price. I would recommend this phone for anyone that is looking for high quality phone at better than half the price of the big name units.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "My Preliminary Review of BLU Life View - Unlocked Phone", "Author": "The Truth Man", "ReviewID": "R3PLYL79TQ2YET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought a BLU Life View through Amazon.com and have used it for about one week.  So far, the phone works great and it is fast enough for the things cell phones were originally made for, i.e. make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, etc.  I have not used it to watch movies yet, but I don't see why it would not work great for watching movies, too. The colors are vibrant and the battery life is good, so far.  I like everything about this phone thus far and I hope it will keep working great.  The main reason I did not give it a `5 Star' rating is due to the sound quality, which is relatively poor.  Sometimes it is difficult to hold conversation over the phone due to the poor sound quality. I have tried some software products to boost the sound, but none of them work. Also, the size of the phone is a little bit too big, but I can live with it.  The price is not bad though, given the fact that it is an unlocked phone.  Have you tried to buy a Samsung unlocked phone of comparable size and capabilities? I have not tried playing video games on the phone, if I want to play a video game I will play it on a video game console connected to a big screen TV and surround sound so that I can really enjoy it.I will update my review after I have used the phone for several months.Update - 2/5/2014:I used the phone for about two weeks and it stopped working; the phone just went dead. When I arrived at home from work the day it stopped working, I plugged the phone into several electric outlets to see if it will turn on, but it never did. I contacted the manufacturer, bluproducts for help. Blueproducts sent some instructions to me via email.  I followed the instructions, but the phone never turned on - no lights, nothing at all. I returned the phone to the seller, L2D2.  I believe that the seller fixed whatever the problem was. However, instead of the seller telling me that it fixed the problem, the seller told me that the phone was working when I returned it. Well, I know for certain that the phone was not working when I returned it,otherwise I would not have returned it to the seller because I really like the phone as I stated in my initial review. Now, the seller wants to return the phone back to me or charge me 30% restocking fee. The problem is, since I know that the phone was definitely not working when I returned it to L2D2, that leads me to believe that L2D2 fixed the phone and the problem is most likely to arise again. I know one thing for sure, I or any other person else should not be charged a restocking fee for returning a defective product.  If Amazon lets this happen then Amazon is implying that sellers can sell defective products to buyers and when a buyer returns a defect product the seller can make a lot of money by charging restocking fee to the unsuspecting buyer.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "a HUGE beauty!", "Author": "gina", "ReviewID": "R3N9Q8H119A67D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome phone..

I've never owned a smartphone before because I couldn't afford the costly monthly data plans. I've relied mostly on my tablet and Wi-Fi or my friends with smartphones. I bought this because I needed a quadband GSM phone while studying abroad in Europe. The phone covers the 4 major frequency ranges for most cell service providers in any country in the world. Having Android apps while travelling is very handy. I can now: - download and save maps using Google Maps - check the weather and email - take decent quality pictures/videos & upload them on social media - video chat using Skype - set alarms, reminders, timers, and manage my Google calendar - listen to music using Google Play, Pandora, iHeartRadio, & the FM radio included with the earphones - read e-Books, pds, and comics using Adobe Reader and Amazon Kindle app - have a calculator, money conversion apps, and notepads for shopping list and tracking spending - watch videos and movies on Youtube and NetflixPros: - Powerful processor & decent RAM - Big & responsive screen - 12 MP back-camera with decent flash and 5 MP front-camera - 16 GB of internal storage - comes with decent skin & earphones compatible with the FM tuner app - Quadband GSM and 3G combatible - Unlocked phone/no contract required - Long battery life and charges quickly - Decent Wi-fi and Bluetooth connectivity - Feels nice and thin and fits nicely in my pocket (even with the size of the screen) - Easy to hold (even with small hands)Cons: - No SD expansion slot (didn't need it because I had Google Drive & DropBox) - Not 4G compatible - Camera didn't take very good photos near bright light (I'm new at using camera apps though) - Feels weird to hold while trying to take pictures with the phone horizontally - not a lot of custom skins and accessories available (included skin is okay though and most large phone cases hold well)", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Value", "Author": "B. Collins", "ReviewID": "RORIKKQD3CMR3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a professional cellphone sales person and my galaxy device was stolen. I wanted to get a comparable device without using my upgrade so that I can save it for something new. When I received the Blu Life View I was a bit hesitant after having been around all the top end smartphones. So the first thing I did was put it to the test, and I have had no difficulty downloading apps or any other content. The device has a mid to large display in the industry and at 720 you can\u2019t complain considering the price. It is snappy and works well under the average to heavy use I put it through. I have yet to reach the current storage capabilities, however as a professional I know the reasonable expectations of the hardware. Now as for the potentially negative. The device prematurely displays the charged indicator on average claiming to be charged around 95%, however the screen still displays the accurate percentage. And while I am talking about the battery I generally go about 12 hours between charges. Keep in mind it is never turned off nor can it go 15 minutes without the display being activated. Despite those mild irritants the only true complaint I have is that the \u201csmart gestures\u201d are useless, the device develops glitches and freezes when locking and unlocking while these are enabled. So in conclusion for UNDER $300 off contract it is a GOOD BUY if you are looking for a display to make your iPhone and small android using friends jealous. Or for any other reason you may want to have a large display. Just make sure to leave the \u201csmart gestures\u201d OFF and keep your expectations reasonable. If you do so I am sure will enjoy your Blu Life View.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Maurifortuna", "ReviewID": "R1RGCVYMGOF247", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: I bought this last month, have 2 sim cards and both work perfectly. Internet works fine. And the overall phone met all my expectations. This phone works!!! Everything works fine, the screen is awesome, the speaker is enough and the appearance of the phone is flawless.This thing is amazing, the phone is beautiful and the back cover is very resilient.The weight is very well balanced and the feel of the phone is solid.The headphones are comfortable and the sound is the best I have heard coming from a phone.I tested the Bluetooth and works fantastic, the wifi is lightning fast. The range of the wifi signal let me go farther away than any other of my devices.I haven\u2019t tried the 4G but the speed in 3.5G works much better than my last double sim phone.I was amazed because the GPS is accurate and it find the locations faster than any other phone I have, even the Iphone and other android devices.The cameras are perfect; back is 12mp and front 5.The charge of the battery last from almost 2 days to 3 days. In extensive play, movies and internet sessions it last one day. The phone charges very fast.Cons: It has only 1GB RAM. I have installed a lot of apps and have many open at the same time and I have not experienced any lag whatsoever.Only have 16GB of space. I have put a lot of music and about 2GB on books, thousands of pictures and videos, installed a bunch of apps and still have over 6GB free.I think it will be better with a stylus. I will buy one.There are no cases, or covers, nor any accessories available.MHL doesn\u2019t work. You cannot transmit audio from the usb. I have a car mount that charges the phone and the cable also goes into the car stereo, but only works with mhl capable phones like the Samsung galaxy line.The micro usb is backwards so the phone will not fit in the fixed docks or stereos.Overall: Is a fantastic double sim phablet, beautiful and fast, and even if a have some suggestions is the best device of its kind for under $300.

I bought my Life View in mid-October 2013.  1st one didnt work right out of the box.  :(  <sigh>  Hope i do not get this much trouble for a replacement on the second one.  Amazon.com took care of replacing the first one.Whats the deal with the lack of storage on the phone.  I barely have any apps and I am always out of storage.  Everything possible has been moved to phone storage from internal storage and still I cannot load any apps due to lack of space.Biggest problem though is the screen.  My screen goes black but it is still responsive to touch.  If i touch the right areas of the screen, i can answer phone calls, listen to music, all text people by accident.  But no  matter what i do, i can see the screen.  Its black as night.  music can be blaring, volume buttons on side of phone work but no screen to know what im doing or touching.  It ticks me off.  I have to hard boot the phone.

For the price, the hardware is pretty amazing, especially the Life View with the aluminum casing and 12mp camera (peel off the protective film over the lens). I was hoping the Dash was an isolated incident but then the first, and every time after I unlocked the screen the dial pad would launch on its own. I though I could live with it but then a few days after getting it I had a hard time \"waking\" it up and decided it was just to reminiscent of how the Dash started and within a couple weeks went completely nuts opening apps, tapping constantly on its own, and so on. Breed did send an email asking if I was satisfied with the purchase and I told them about the dial pad issue, they said they would check with CT-Miami LLC and ask if they knew of a fix but I never got another reply after that. If you get a good one then I have no doubt you will love it, but having two different models go bad within a few weeks of each other is enough for me to not make it a third, so I will wither spend a little more for similar bells and whistles or the same on less, but either way will go with a brand I know I can trust rather than buy another Blu and go through the disappointment again.I caution you to read all of the reviews and if you do buy one, just be prepared to have to send it back.

My phone arrived and it worked right out of the box, I have not encountered any of the wonky workings that some people have experienced and both sim ports work. I am glad I did not kick out the extra bucks for a Galaxy Mega and got this phone instead", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "GOOD PHONE FOR THE PRICE", "Author": "Ai Wintermute", "ReviewID": "R7IOA0K4LH3L6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me preface this with, you get what you pay for.SCREEN: The screen is large, bright, colorful and sharp, however IT IS NOT GUERRILLA GLASS, you can even see in the picture that its contoured around the edges, it is molded plastic.  That being said, its not bad, not as good as glass for sliding your finger across it, but its usable.The resolution is perfect for this size, while its IS the PHONE VERSION of ANDROID, those who want to replace their tablet will be annoyed by the OVER-SIZING of everything, so even though it is high resolution, many apps still look low res, with GIANT title bars and HUGE TEXT.  I think the idea of these new phones with 1080p is all hype, you cant see the pixels on a 5.7\" screen at 1280x768, all you add with 1080p is more overhead for the GPU to draw, which seems kinda bad to me.ON TO THE REALLY BAD, I don't know if its just my unit, but if you let it sit on the desktop screen for any short period of time, IT BURNS INTO THE DISPLAY.  Now this is temporary, turning off the phone for an hour or so, it disappears, but its REALLY BAD if you ask me.  Specially on GREY SCREENS, you will see a perfect imprint of your wallpaper, clock, all the buttons, etc.Also, the touch screen isn't very good and for some reason while its plugged in, it becomes temperamental. Example:  While scrolling through a menu system, it will accidentally click items in the menu and not just once, its almost like its tapping multiple times.  After using it for some time, it got a little better, but even in games when you use twist gestures, it will get all wonky.  Usable, but could cause added stress.It came with screen protectors, but it makes the touch screen even less reliable, so I removed it right away.HARDWARE BUTTONS:  The device has hardware buttons that are touch sensitive, I don't prefer hardware buttons, because they are really easy to ACCIDENTALLY touch while playing games, etc.  Sorta like the WINDOWS key that you accidentally hit and your back at your desktop, annoying.  If they were software buttons, you could use third party apps to hide the bar and allow gestures or slide to reveal it.AUTO DIMMING \"feature\":  SUPER ANNOYING, if you don't touch the screen for about 10 seconds, IT DIMS... You cant turn it off in the settings and NO THIRD PARTY APP WILL STOP IT FROM DOING SO...BUILD QUALITY:  it feels solid, I am not a fan of the hidden compartment with the snap off back plate, those little snaps can break, but you only really have to access it to put your SIM(s) in, so not so bad.CAMERA: The rear camera is very poor quality in low light, everything appears cloudy, I put a piece of tape over the front camera, so I cant comment on it.CHARGING: Unlike the NEXUS 7, which I returned, you can actually USE the device while it charges and It does charge... slowly, while plugged into my laptop, while playing games on the device. Having a STANDARD USB port for charging is great, no proprietary plugs, like my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7.SPEED:  The phone is fast and games play really well.  Galaxy on Fire 2, plays beautifully, The SIMS FreePlay works great.CONCLUSION:  I bought this phone from staples for $250, is it worth $250, probably, but with the NEXUS 5 coming out, I am torn between returning this phone because of the issues and waiting for the NEXUS 5, or just keep it and learn to live with it...  I am sure the NEXUS 5 will probably be much more expensive anyway.*** UPDATE 09/30/13 ***I have decided to keep this phone, after searching for possible replacements, the only options are other Chinese phones with no US support.  I can live with the shortcomings of this phone.  My biggest issue, the burn in effect is avoided by setting the daydreaming (screen saver) to 1 minute.*** UPDATE 10/29/13 ***Well, its been over a month since I bought this phone.  Thought I would post an update.The auto dimming, still annoying, but other than that, the phone has been great.  After turning on Daydream, I have not had the burn in issue on the screen and the phone is very reliable, never crashes and the speed is pretty consistent.As for the plastic screen debate, I have come to the conclusion that its possible the earlier model had a plastic screen and that is why mine was $50 cheaper from staples.Final verdict, worth every penny!", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE", "Author": "decima buffong", "ReviewID": "R3GIHDWH5MJM9G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I previously bought this phone and can you believe its only been FIVE days and it has stopped working ??!!

Didn't have any complaints until a few months later when two things happened:First, because you can't use a SD card with it, you need to be memory conscious, which is fine. It has two memory storage areas - a smaller one for critical phone software and a larger one for additional things you want to add to your phone (apps for instance).Everything by default goes to the MUCH smaller memory storage and will very quickly make your phone block things like emails, pictures, or text messages. Mostly an annoying inconvenience, but not anything that can't be fixed.Problem number two however, is much, much worse:The phone freezes randomly. Black screen as though it is off. Battery is charged and memory is fine. No malware present, etc. It just goes black and will not respond. There is no access to the phone's battery. Not. At. All. So you cannot hard reset this thing. You just have to hold down the power button for about 15 - 20 seconds and then it will finally turn back on. This is not acceptable. I need my phone in good working order at all times.There are other irritations also, but nothing that would make me stop using the phone however, I should mention them too so as to be a complete review...Though there is a place to change the date format (i.e. month/day/year or day/month/year) It doesn't matter what you set it to, since it will always display the same way no matter what. I live in the U.S. so our standard date format is day/month/year and it won't change to that no matter what I set the format to in the phone settings.Next, no matter what you set your screen time-out to, it will always dim if you don;t touch the screen within ten seconds. This is especially annoying when watching a video or playing a game or trying to read an article/book on the phone. There is just no way that I can find at all to adjust this default screen dimming.The menu is a tiny bit confusing to navigate, in that there are just certain settings that I either can't find, or just simply don't exist, such as, you must set a ringtone from the music or sound that you download, as there is no option within the phone's actual settings to do this.Anyway, I still like the phone, just a bit irritated with it.

Most things I've downloaded from Play work fine.  The screen dimming thing is annoying, though Blu support says they're working on a firmware release to correct it but still no ETA.My biggest issue with the phone had been the lack of a case.  BLU has not released any, and it doesn't come with one.  And it feels so slippery that I was afraid I'd drop it.  After some searching, I discovered the dimensions are nearly identical to the Samsung Galaxy Mega 5.7.  And since the SGM doesn't appear to be all that popular, I bought a few of the flip cases which are ridiculously inexpensive (7 Colors Generic Flip Cover Case For Samsung Galaxy Mega 5.8 I9150 I9152 (Black)).  In short, theses cases all variations on fake leather styling but contain an identical plastic tray which retains the phone just fine.  But the button slots are a slightly higher, covering the bottom of the power button and the volume-down rocker.  Using an exacto knife and dremmel, I was able to lengthen the slots to reveal the full buttons in about 5 minutes.  But even without the modification, the case doesn't press the button, just makes it irksome to press yourself.The bigger challenge was the camera.  The SGM camera is apparently in the center of the phone.  Measuring and cutting the hole for the camera & flash LED in the plastic did require a dremmel.  Then I had to use the exacto knife to cut through the case itself - fake leather over essentially cardboard.  It took about an hour, but I'm very happy with the result.

Very fast internet connection .The Phone it doesn't have a Memory Card Slot but after the OS I get almost 13gb of space which is a lot more than I was expecting .It comes loaded with a nice pair of Headsets and they Sound really good , The phone didn't come with a Case like my Mom's Life play but it did come with the Screen Protector .I will update my review once i finish testing the phone but meanwhile you can't get wrong by getting this one .Good Job BLU!!!", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Huge, crisp display, solid design, beautiful camera, and excellent battery", "Author": "BEN CROMBIE", "ReviewID": "R3352DYLKGPG5H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Phone after my nexus 4 went AWOL.

Do not expect my review to be at all biased, as this review comes from a very neutral point to view.  Let me start out by saying this (phablet) is an excellent product.  The build quality is substantial at the price point.  At no point can this product be described as \"you get what you pay for\".  For this price point (as an android device) it is an excellent device and the best substitute for the higher priced phablets i.e samsung phones or samsung note 2/3 devices. It comes equipped with the bare essentials of the android operating system without all the bloatware and gimmick features as most phones/phablets comes with.  The build quality is actually very impressive (better than samsung IMO).While unpacking I was quite impressed with the device, however at first impression I felt it was much bigger than any previous phone/phablet I had used.  But I approached it with an open mindset (since I was used to the iPhone size) it did not take me long to realize that it was too big to be portable.  The first few moments I took to personalize the settings to my liking and then I spent a few more moments to replace micro simcard (using an adapter) to place my micro SIM card from my iPhone to the new Blue Life View.  The process was very simple, and the phablet recognized my (AT&T;) SIM card very easily.  Within a few minutes I was up & running on the new phablet.  During my usage I found the network speeds to be quite fast (however lacking LTE).  I was able to browse any website of my liking; however I was still always aware of the limited portability i.e carrying it around in my pocket, holding it in my hand at all times.  Basically it was way too big to carry around as a normal phone.The operating system:  I found the operating system (after initial google sign-in to Google-Play) to be quite simple.  But this got more and more complicated as I started downloading more apps.Allow me to explain:  Most of my review has to do more with the operating system (which is the core of usability) rather than the device.  I downloaded many familiar apps as I have on my iPhone; however I ran across many issues.  I downloaded a game which my son loves to play but for some reason on the android OS the app decided to play a 30 second video Advertisement after each level.  It did not take me long (2 levels) to delete the app which is an entire process itself (which I'll explain shortly).  The second thing I was recommended to do by the OS was to download an antivirus/anti malware app to sift through each app I downloaded from the Play Store.  Thirdly I downloaded a \"launcher\" app to personalize my phablet a bit more; however this was quite more tedious process than I had anticipated.  Seconds after downloading this \"app\" I had a popup stating my phone had been infected with \"malware\" and that I needed to have my phone scanned. Thinking this was the antivirus/malware app I clicked on the \"OK\" button it took me to another link to download more software.  I quickly learned this was a trick and exited the process.  This became more apparent with more apps that I downloaded.  Moreover I learned that any app I downloaded I needed to download multiple \"plugins/extensions\" for it to work (i.e widgets/lock screen widgets).  Moving onto even more problems with the OS I will say this, when I downloaded a very popular game it showed up on the app-list however when I tried to open the app it would only open a couple of times and then I had to re-install it for it to work.  These things are not normal as I am very used a fluid system.  For example when I delete an app on the iPhone from the home screen the app is automatically uninstalled, but on android OS I had to go into the app view or the play-store to uninstall any apps, and what was even more frustrating I had to sift through and uninstall any extensions I had installed.  Overall it was very time-consuming and painstaking.  I also tried to download an app and repeatedly go the following Error Message: Incompatible with other application(s) using the same shared user ID.  I looked all over the forums for a fix however I was unable to find a fix to this issue (which should not even be an issue when downloading any app).  Lastly I tried to download an app from the play-store however I reached the following message \"These are only to list a few of the issues I had with the OS (android).  These things were all dependent on the OS (android).All I have to say about the OS is that iOS is a billion times easier to use without the issues I had to face with android OS.  I will say that I am not a novice when it comes to tech.  I am quite advanced in the use of computers/phones however I am basing this review from a first time user\u2019s point of view.Enough about the poor OS, lets more onto the phablet itself.  As I mentioned earlier, it is a fantastic substitute to the many higher end devices.  The build quality is actually very nice.  Least but not last this device is excellent if you in the market for a high end but budget device because the price is excellent for a dual sim-card phablet.  The screen is excellent for web-browsing, taking pictures, videos etc. however as mentioned earlier the device itself is not very portable.After having the device I had to replace my sim-card into my iPhone so I could actually use it on the go.  I found to be using this device more often while at home on WiFi as a tablet versus a phone.  Unfortunately I will be returning this device to Staples where I purchased it from this the reasons mentioned above.  Not to take anything away from Blu, but I felt this device just did not meet my needs such as (ease of use, portability, LTE, ease of OS etc).  I am planning on purchasing a Blu Life One which supports a 5\u201d screen, but that depends on availability.  If you are looking for an unlocked device for the $300 dollar range, then this device beats any other on the market.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone rocks!", "Author": "paul voegtlin", "ReviewID": "R1ZBRPA86DGJDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually owned the blu VEVO before I bought this phone. but the battery life was not good enough for me on my job. this phone on the other hand is really great the screen is huge and that is good for my big fingers. the body of the phone stays very cool I guess because its solid aluminum. the charging cord and the headset cord are flat and never tangle! I heard from complains about it being only 16 gigabytes but with all the different ways of storing information into various clouds, I don't find it to be an issue at all.

I have over 10 gigs in music alone on my SD card that I am using in my Galaxy S2. Save your money, and get a Note II at least it has expandable memory slot, and also has a better screen. You can find them as low as $400All specs, and literature that could be found online (including Blu's website) stated that there was an expandable SD slot. When it came out, nope........so I emailed them, and indeed there is no slot on it. They also posted to Facebook that there isn't one.Just don't think that you can trust a company that advertises one thing, and then when the product comes out, it is different (a BIG difference).**EDIT**So, I decided to give this another try after finding some ways around the 16G memory (Google music, Google Drive, ETC) I have upped this review to 4 stars.

I am still loading apps on it, as I remember them.I will edit this as time goes on.**Edit 2**So far so good, have all of my apps installed, and running smooth, screen is great, I see things that I never saw on my S2 in games, etc.I did run into an issue trying to install one game where it said that I didn't have enough space, even though I was choosing \"external storage\" I had to uninstall a large program, install the game, and then reinstall the app I uninstalled.**Edit 3**I have to say, battery life is AWESOME with this thing.....I can easily get 26Hrs on a charge, and that is not just sitting there doing nothing, that is emails, text, MMS, games, Facebook.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "phones are fine but sometimes go out alone and do not work on 4G. you can tell me what's going on if you are supposed to run on", "Author": "jorge limon", "ReviewID": "R2R7LGA6TLR61U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "phones are fine but sometimes go out alone and do not work on 4G. you can tell me what's going on if you are supposed to run on 4G. something that can make the company BLU. or tell me where I can investigate that.

Let me tell you the real situation about the blu phones. The decent quality, 2 sim cards, good prices, good specs for a budget phone and TERRIBLE SUPPORT OR NO SUPPORT AT ALL. THINK twice before buy anything  from BLU PRODUCTS COMPANY.Short story - you bought the BLU phone and its working with no issues - you very LUCKY !! start playing lottery $) and be happy BLU PRODUCTS owner.Long story - you bought the BLU phone and you have some issues (DOA, headphone jack broken, black pixels on the screen, short battery life, Android is always low on memory, ECHO on microphone .. screen clicking by itself ...etc ) - welcome to HELL !! If you still have refund or replacement period = you lucky again.  Otherwise - YOU JUST WAISTED  200$-300$ from your wallet. If you want to find the truth $) be my guest = read the whole story = IT WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF TIME AND PAIN !!!First off I had 4 Smartphone's. (3 had issues)2012 1st Blu Studio 5.3 - black dots, bad design of case - the screen was visible detached from system board. = sent for replacement.2012 2nd Blu Studio 5.3 - first half year great phone for its money. (270$) great battery life - 4-5 days with 5.3 screen =  very happy. until the headphone jack stopped working normally - some hiss sound with tapping when you plug the headphones. no more movies or private conversations on the go  ... Tried to fix it... went to couple stores for repair  - the verdict unfixable ... Give it away to my neighbors to use it as GPS on his car.Tried  to contact BLU Products for warranty repair  - welcome to some BLU marry-go-round - \"please contact distributor\" and distributor  replays ... since its out of 30 days from the day of purchase - \"please contact  BLU products\"  I did wrote  around 30 yes its 30 !!!!! emails ... trying to resolve  this issue ... still no help.Hmm  ... I am still trying to find the truth $) and some service  .  I did find the email of CEO of BLU Products ... and sent to him all my correspondence  with the supervisors from BLU and Vendor  stamped by dates ... in one huge email .... just to  be relieved  of this whole nonsense and terrible customer support.2013 3rd BLU STUDIO 2 - To be honest I was surprised when I got answer from him directly .  Very  delicate  and nicely written letter  with apology and offer to get new model of BLU STUDIO 5.3 Smartphone  !!! free of charge. OMG all this emails .. looking for help finally  paid off...  HAPPY END ????  NO WAY  only half story ...When I got new Smartphone  BLU Studio 5.3 II.  It worked nicely  for couple weeks than ... its start failing APART.Here are list of  issues with BLU  smarphone1) Clicking by itself ... and the screen is not responsive a lot of times  (even when I did factory reset and as test did capture couple pictures ... it happened again and again)2) Low RAM ...  Even with couple applications  since its only 512 mb of ram its freezing and shutting down apps . A lot of freezing with GPS on and map from Google with data connection on and Bluetooth on. Especially when trying to play music on background  ... its start freezing and shutting down applications by itself.3) Very low battery life ... the original BLU were holding up to 4-5 days of active use ... this one ... less than a DAY. (I did charging now 2 times a day)4)Echo - a lot of complains from my coworkers and friends  .So I did start warranty service on this \"gift\" from CEO of BLU PRODUCTS.  I was out of states for work...  So it took me a several weeks to send for repair/ replacement.I was assured multiply times that if  issues (the main one - clicking on the screen by itself) will be confirmed - they will replace it with new model.But in real life  ...another 20 emails ... no real help ... only promises to resolve the issue and make me happy.  they tried to charge me 80$ for replacing wet ?? system board ..  and finally sent back pretty much same unit with replaced  screen, system board and same defective battery ...  nice job....2013 4th BLU STUDIO 2  - So for now I did give  it to friend as present. with explanation - no obligation from me.... and if something will happen to this phone ???  I don't care and don`t do anything Real to help with this wonderful  Smartphone.
