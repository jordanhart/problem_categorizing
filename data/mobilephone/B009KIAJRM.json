{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Basic phone", "Author": "carrie s.", "ReviewID": "RQGA08EYPCJXQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to down grade my sprint plan. I was paying way to much for my unlimted plan on a smart phone, I had 1500 mintues plus unlimted data and text, which i bearly used 200 mintues a month. I chose the Brio for it's qwerty keyboard, I have a medical issue with my hands and can only use one hand to text and am not a fan of phones with just the number pad. It is a very basic phone, texting, calling and basic picture taking and messaging functions work great. Basic user interface and basic pre loaded ring tones, calander and alarm clock. Does have an sd card slot that you can carry your contacts and picture from phone to phone, but fair warning some pictures are hard to see on the small screen. I do not use the web becuase I will not pay extra for a data plan. The button size maybe to small for some, it took me about a day to get use to using the keyboard, but they work from my small hand. Clear call quality and gets better service (bars) then my smart phone did, drops service a lot less than my smart phone did. All and all a good basic phone. If you use a Sprint air-rave in your home to get service like I do, just note that the air-rave only can regonize a small amount of numbers. If you find that you can not send or recived texts in your home call air-rave tech support to make sure that the air-rave device is programmed to regonize your phone. That will fix the issue!", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kyocera Brio S3015 Sprint", "Author": "RayV", "ReviewID": "R2F2MXXDFUR8Y0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased two of these several months ago as replacement phones and I must say it is fundamentally a solid phone and has so far served us very well. In order to properly convey our critique I first have to put our cell phone usage into proper context. We use cell phones on a very basic level. We do phone calls, SMS and MMS, storing and retrieving contact information, alarm clock feature as well as time and calender functions. Although the phone is web capable, we do not require nor want to subscribe to data plans as we consider them not only costly, but redundant services that we already subscribe too for home use. That being said this phone exceeds our cell phone requirements. Phone conversations over our Sprint service are for the most part impressively clear in the North East United States and Caribbean regions. Although the key pad has fairly small keys, I am still able to tap out text messages with my fairly large thumbs and with minimal corrections. I rarely have to reboot the phone and it has so far survived a few nasty drops. It has a very familiar look and feel to the Blackberry Curve 8330 that I previously used before Sprint imposed a mandatory data plan causing me to stop using the Blackberry. Overall the phone is very impressive and I would buy it again in heart beat. I gave it four stars because it only has a 2.5 mm headphone connection and while the camera produces great pictures, it does not have video capabilities nor does it function as an MP3 player. Also it would have been perfect if the phone had a wifi feature. If your cell phone requirements are similar to ours, I highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone!", "Author": "brittany kirk", "ReviewID": "R2M44KEE2MP48", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I very much enjoy using this phone.

I did not want to commit to 2 more years with Sprint, so I was really happy to be able to buy a simple, basic phone for a low cost and get it up and running on my existing contract.As far as the phone itself, I bought it b/c it had the qwerty keyboard, but I find the keys a bit small for my extra large fingers.  I manage, but it can be difficult.  I also have not been able to figure out how to get a custom ring tone on the phone.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does the job", "Author": "MG", "ReviewID": "R1GU4U48COUV6R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because I needed a non-smart phone that would allow me to text and talk comfortably. I don't know if it is the phone itself that has glitches or the phone is too used and thus I have to turn it on and off sometimes in order to send a text message but besides that it works just fine. It looks very nice, I wanted something that wasn't a flip or slide phone and so this fit best.So far I'm satisfied.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "great little not-quite-a-smartphone", "Author": "J.
