I ordered it as \"unlocked\" because it is a \"T-Mobile\" phone, but it works perfectly with my AT&T; network.  I opted for this phone because I wear dual hearing aids and use a streamer for blue tooth connectivity; this phone offers stereo blue tooth capability, with music, so I'm able to listen to my music wirelessly.
