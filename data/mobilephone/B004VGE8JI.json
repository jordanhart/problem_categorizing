It was used which I was fully aware of.  However, the phone was advertised to be in VERY GOOD condition.  After receiving this phone I found that it would not function unless plugged into a charger.  That's even after charging overnight and trying multiple different batteries.  The vendor claimed after he got it back that it works, but I think he was just covering his a$$.  I have become very tentative about buying products from third parties through Amazon as this only one of several recent bad experiences/returns.  At least I did get a full refund.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "pcman", "ReviewID": "R1TO38Y3SKX9TU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the v9m phone is all i use  i love it big buttons eay to use not complicated and lotsstorage space will always use it recommend this to anyone who just wants a simple phone they can talk anf text and take aweesome photos", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unauthorized Charger Error", "Author": "David Greenbaum \"CEO, Axiom\"", "ReviewID": "R3RB05HMGJ1C3E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Most chargers I try to use with this phone -- EVEN MOTOROLA CHARGERS -- give an \"Unauthorized Charger Error\".
