I fell in love with it since I got it out of the box.PROS:* Slim design, executive look* Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional (great improvement)* AGPS. 100% accurate when you choose My Location. Associated with  google maps is an A+. (Why pay for something that is already part of the  phone...That goes for you VERIZON!!!!).* Opera Browser works great (sorry Internet Explorer)* Touchscreen is very responsive (if you do not want screen to vibrate,  you can disable it in SETTINGS.* Stylus, I do not use it. my fingers do the job excellent.* Push E-Mail. I get all my emails from work, POP accounts, Gmail, (which  is already integrated in the phone), and of course windows live  messenger.* Video player is very good, good resolution, great audio. (One thing  I dicovered today is that I can listen to Internet radio, WOW!!)* My 5 Faves...NOT REALLY, but keep reading, (in this case 4 faves, yes, one of the widgets lets you add 4  people you call the most just like my five faves.) I am using my Omnia  with T-mobile and this came very handy.)* Microsoft Office, YES! you have Excel, Word, Power Point. All 3 are  mobile version, you can read and edit any documents as you wish. you  also can read .pdf files, isn't that something?? you will love this  phone.CONS:* I personaly, don't have any negative comments on this phone, but I will  mention one that I know bothers some people out there, that is:  NO 3G Network compatibility in the USA. This phone was made exclusively  for Asia and Europe and their 3G works on a different band.  But I tell  you one thing, Internet over EDGE is very good, so I really don't care  at all about 3G speed. So keep this in mind....NO 3G in the USA.Over All, this is a great phone. you will have to take your time to play with it to find all its features and how to make them work for you. Don't get frustrated if you don't get it to work the way you want the first time. It took me a good week to figure this phone out and now I am very excited I chose this phone. Iphone is a thing of the past, which I never had but my friends have it and some of them are not too happy with it, plus, they got stuck in a contract. Here you don't have to do that.Thank you SAMSUNG for this phone.I have include this link called Omnia i900 - The Whole Nine YardsThis will make you take a final decision to get this phone or not.Hope it helps, like it helped me to get this phone[...]Thanks! and let me know what you think.", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "great device but some serious shortfalls", "Author": "Christina Valente \"christina5857\"", "ReviewID": "R1NJMT8RCGLCY6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I decided to stay with Verizon instead of switching to ATT to go with the Apple Iphone.I am an early adapter, I picked my omnia over the blackberry storm when both had just come out in january 09.The Omnia offered far better processing speed, immensley better use of the touch screen technology, better screen resolution, full version of MS office rather than just a viewer and the use of Internet Explorer Mobile for internet viewing as well as Opera (not able to view all internet pages).The camera was superior, the integration with outlook was phenominal and the bundled apps were perfect.Learning curve on the Keyboard was tough but manageable.Althouth I believe this product is electronically far superior to the Iphone and Storm, there are some serious issues that have not - and probably will never be resolved as Samsung is already moving on to their next \"superphone\" without resolution of problems with this one and Microsoft has already (at the announcement of this phone) announced the release date of Windows Mobile 7.0..Although the Iphone is slower and has less memory, it has a far more predictable speed allowing for constant rate of typing and response . . the Omnia - like anything running Windows - bogs down over the course of the day making the search and input speed vary. This is fine until you figure out how to use the keyboard to do email and are maddly typing only to find that the phone is three letters behind you...A simple reset solves the issue but . . . . you dont have to reset an Iphone every day!The battery life is no where near advertized. If I unplug the phone at 7AM it starts complaining that a recharge is necessary by 5PM . . just in time for the evening commute- heck of a time for the cell phone to run out!If you are accessing the internet or listenting to music or a movie, you get about 6 hrs before the low battery alarm starts chiming.Standby time is about 36 hrs - lot of good that does though!Apple had similar issues with their phones and worked some fixes on the early ones, Samsung has no intention.When you are on a high call day . .or watching a video on the phone, the phone gets hot . . my IR thermometer says over 103 degrees . . .Samsung says this is normal and fine . . .dont know about that as there is a Lithium Polymer battery in there and that is getting hot too.I have had two phones and they both acted the same way, this is a design issue not a particular unit.The biggest reason to think carefully about the purchase of this phone is that there are NO aftermarket apps that mix well with Mobile 6.1 and none on the horizon that are reasonable.I tried to find a calculator to figure time cards, the Blackberry progam was 9.99, the palm version was 4.99, the Iphone app was 9.99 and the windows mobile version - with no promise of compatibility with 6.1 - was 49.99.Check on Amazon, downloads.com and try to find aftermarket software for windows 6. . . .not much . . .Go to Apple Store and see how many apps are out there for Iphone . . heck, there is even an app that allows you  to use it as a flute!I like the Omnia even with it's faults but wish I had known then what I know now . . If you have no intention of doing anything other than what this phone has built into it, then it is better than an Iphone. If you want to watch movies and listen to tunes, have some odd and end games for the train ride home at night, then dont waste your time with this phone, buy an Iphone.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "A costly toy", "Author": "BK", "ReviewID": "R2LSVC7RW7XEDR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, I bought this phone thinking that it would resolve the problems I was having with my treo 750...HA!  It has created more problems than solutions.  Touch screen doesn't respond as you would expect and as stated in other reviews the widgets are small and sometimes hard to manage.I was so excited to get this phone, windows mobile 6, great internet, email, on and on.  It states in the phone review that this phone is compatable with microsoft voice command.  That isn't the case, at least not for my i900. I used voice command with my treo 750 and it worked great so I just assumed it would work with the i900...it does not.  So while you can receive calls thru the blue tooth headset, you can not make a call and that is huge for me.  This is definitely a big negative.It won't send picture messages as advertised, at least not with T-mobile.  Texting and email work fine.  If the email is set up correctly thru your phone service it works great and you can either receive emails automatically, set it up to retrieve them every few hours or get them when manually requested .I guess that if I had done a better job of researching the pros and cons of purchasing a phone made in Asia, I might have waited.  You won't get any help from Samsung USA as they just give you the excuse that since the phone is European, they do not support it in the US.

I too have a Samsung Omnia. As you read the reviews everyone sings the praises of all the \"features\" of this phone.

Guess I'll keep toting my laptop.Now the calls - you want to put the call on speaker? First you have to hit the little mouse pad to remove the stupid black box, then hit the speaker button -Oh, I'm sorry did I lose the call?Did you miss a call? I don't know. First you have to pick up the phone - shake it repeatedly to switch back to portrait, enter your security code then you may see a box that tells you a phone number. Does it tell you what time or if they left a voice mail - no that would be too convenient.If you are thinking it may be time to upgrade your phone I strongly recommend you go into the providers store and get a \"hands-on\" experience because it may just turn out the phone doesn't do the simple things. 23 more months, sigh.", "Date": "June 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung Omnia...what's Latin for \"brick\"?", "Author": "A.

The clock and alarm apps decide they're only going to work when THEY want to...the Opera app decides it can't run at all because despite what the memory status is telling you , it thinks there is no more memory left...there is much much more..I had a 2G iphone for a year before the iphone was released here and even with the restrictions I had network-wise made that a more functional handset...I did/do not want another iphone because I wanted a phone that had \"more features\"...but seriously, I cnanot beleive that I haven't yet launched this Omnia into a wall..", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lovely to Look at Terrible to Use", "Author": "S.

Completely unusable... Microsoft Mobile Windows may attempt to bill itself as competition for  the Android and Iphone but frankly its not even in the same ballpark as these competitors and its insulting to them to mention this disastrous attempt at a smartphone in the same breath as those two...The big issue: no manual keypad...And as much as its possible for Iphone to get away with that, asking a Windows Mobile system to take on the same challenge only succeeds at making obvious how non-competitive Windows Mobile is at this point in time....While Iphone has an amazingly seamless digital interface the OS on this disaster is amazing in the opposite way: Its amazing anyone thought this was usable enough to sell to the public. The other day it took me over 5 minutes just to save a number because of the constant typos caused by the stunningly inaccurate touchpad.Its a shame too because the phone has a ton of features...Problem is that with an interface this horrible no one is likely to have the patience to bother to try to use any of them.Pros:This phone has a great camera and good battery life.....Umh, lets see...I guess those are the only positive things I can think of...Otherwise, its a disaster and an embarrassment..I'm actually thinking of  keeping mine and using it as a camera...I suppose it also might  make a good paperweight...", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good PDA", "Author": "Carlos Hernandez \"path of the one\"", "ReviewID": "R38X4SOMZDXXI9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll start by saying I'm happy with this phone, it does have good looks, works great as a PDA, but need some work as a phone.

I've had a kyocera slider phone, a motorola razor, and an LG Envy 2. This is the worst phone I have ever had. Its sluggish. Its unreliable when you need it most. It constantly needs to be reset, because it frequently won't make calls, receive texts, ring, etc. The touch screen is awful. It can't tell the different between scrolling and clicking if you are using your thumb. I once accidentally \"liked\" a friend's post about her dad passing away from cancer because of this. I know it has a stylus, but who wants to carry that around all day? Half the apps are pretty much unusable because the phone backs up every single picture the app comes across. For example using the Facebook app, it'll save every little thumbnail or picture you see on facebook. For this reason it clutters up your picture saves on the phone to the point you can't find your real pictures. The vibrate feature might as well be the silent feature. I cannot feel my phone vibrate even on the highest vibrate setting. When texting the phone will sneak spaces into your message without pushing any buttons. 90% of my messages are sent with 3 or 4 spaces before the message so the recipient needs to scroll down to find the beginning of the message. It once spaced it 15 lines down.This a terrible phone!!! Don't get it! Once my contract ends I'm getting an iphone! You should get an iPhone instead.

Brunette", "ReviewID": "R28ZQGOMGSKRKB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I made the mistake of getting this phone more than a year ago and it has been an absolute nightmare ever since. There is simply not enough space to list all the negatives about this phone. This is quite possibly the WORST phone I have ever used. I can honestly say I would rather have the brick phone Gordon Gecko used in the movie 'Wall Street' than this poor excuse for a phone.I got this at the time because my wireless carrier did not have Androids yet and I was never a fan of Blackberry's so I decided to go with the Samsung Omnia. Boy..what a mistake. First, this thing is SLOW..I mean incredibly slow. When you transition from landscape to portrait or vice versa it takes about 3-5 seconds to reorient the screen, the touchscreen is unresponsive and sluggish sometimes taking 1-3 seconds to process a press, and the worst part is I cannot answer 50% of the calls I receive because by the time the phone processes that I hit the 'answer' button the person calling has already gone to my voice mail! When on calls this thing 'locks' the keyboard so you're forced to go through a few steps to actually be able to hit the touch tone keypad while on the phone.Next, my wireless carrier made me purchase the data package with this which I do not see why. It is literally next to impossible to use the internet on this. For example if you are trying to scroll up or down on a web page even with the stylus you will 9x out of 10 hit the wrong button or if you want to click on a link you'll end up clicking just about everything EXCEPT the link you originally wanted to click. The zoom feature is just pathetic and you can find a better surfing experience on a Nokia N73 than this thing.Lastly, there are so many annoying random software bugs and glitches associated with this phone it's a wonder if this thing ever went through a QA cycle. For example to access the dialer you must hit the 'phone' left soft key however; when you receive a text message or phone call that left soft key turns to a 'notification' button. You try and 'dismiss' the 'notification' after clicking on it but the 'notification' still continues to show preventing you from using the dialer! You have to keep clicking it 4-5 times to finally get it to go away! Next, this thing makes HORRID 'beeping' noises for no apparent reason. When the battery is about to die it will make this horrible beeping noise, when you turn off Bluetooth or broadband access it will make another loud and obnoxious beeping noise. It will often say it is low on battery keep making annoying beeping sounds yet the phone still stays on for 3-4 days! I am aware you can 'turn off' these sounds but who at Microsoft that was a good idea to spam you with horrible beeping noises? The alarm clock works about 50% of the time which I believe is attributed to the fact the phone does not update the clock when it's hibernating only when it awake from hibernation and I keep receiving a some random reminder that keeps going off every Thursday morning and I have been unable to turn it off.In conclusion spare yourself DO NOT GET THIS PHONE. It runs Windows Mobile 6.1 (nuff said) so I cannot really blame Samsung. I believe there is an open source project right now to try and port the Android OS to this phone and when it is finished I will be one of the first people to put that on my phone! Do not be the laughing stock of your friends DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good once you figure it out and update it.", "Author": "JRH80", "ReviewID": "R256QQC8UAFMEO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone over a year now and it's been a useful companion.

I would recommend doing the update right away before you load any numbers, and if you have already, back up your pim file. If your a chronic websurfer/researcher like I am, this think will display just about any website and allows easy search of pdf files.

If you have an unlimited data plan then you wont have anything to worry about.All features on the phone work well. The Samsung keyboard took a little getting used to since it had XT9 but once you figure out how to disable it then you'll be fine since having word completion can be a bit annoying at times.The Transcriber feature is really good, but there should have been a way to do a test(calibration) so that it can learn to recognise your handwriting since everyone's is different.The finger mouse feature is nice for one handed use, so that would come in handy for most users who multitask.I personally think this is a great phone for anyone who, like myself, loves alot of functionality and features.This is a great phone for the price and has all if not more of the features of the high-end, high priced phones in the $800-900 range.At the time I bought this I had issues with the 3rd party seller with shipping to an address and the apt number was missing and they refunded me within a few days, I would advise all users to make their purchase directly from Amazon since their service is more superior than some 3rd party buyers.Another thing to note is that I purchased the 8GB from the 3rd party at $399.99 but after being refunded I decided to go for the 16GB that was being sold by Amazon with better shipping prices (including the Free Supersaver Shipping) for only $402.I hope you do consider buying this phone since it's a great investment for any of you looking to have fun and functionality together in a phone.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "ehhhhhh... its okayy.", "Author": "O.

And i love it. it is so much more user friendly, you can set almost everything to the way you like it.in conclusion.... if you are looking for a touch phone like the iphone.... skip the omnia and go straight to the storm, with its facebook and flicker built in applications the omnia doesnt compare.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "If you want to be dissapointed, purchase this phone.", "Author": "G. Evans", "ReviewID": "R37QV3AGI0P3FM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Samsung Omnia is a major disappointment.  Let's go over all the things this phone does wrong.1) Touchscreen - There is only vibration feedback when using the keyboard.  You'll find yourself repeatedly tapping a command before the phone finally recognizes your finger press.  The touch keypad is nothing close to the Iphone and impossible to use without the stylus.  It registers on keypress (not release) so typos are a common occurance.2) Slow - Throughout the day I have to run task manager and kill unwanted processes to keep my phone from dragging.  I visit task manager between two and three times a day because this phone can't run at a good pace with more than 4-5 programs running3) Stylus - THERE IS NO INTERNAL STORAGE FOR THE STYLUS!  You have to loop it through a tiny slide bar and let the stylus dangle.  It makes it look like you have eyeliner hanging from your phone.  I've received multiple comments from people at work. (It's very noticeable.)4) Widgets - Terrible.... It's easy to clutter your phone front screen with them and none of the widgets are truly functional except the calendar and Opera shortcuts.  The alert widget is the worst.  You can't set alerts for just one of your email accounts, meaning you'll constantly receive alerts (in the same widget) if you have multiple email / text accounts.5) Visual Voicemail - You have to pay $3 extra a month for this feature.... Ridiculous.6)  Internal Antenna placement - I have dropped more phone calls because of the placement of the antenna on the phone!  The antenna is located on the bottom of the phone and not the top!  So if you hold your omnia like a normal cell phone,  the palm of your hand covers the antenna, instantly dropping your cell phone coverage in half (usually 2-3 bars).  The only way I've made quality calls on the OMNIA is with a handsfree device or via speakerphone with the butt of the phone facing the sky.7) Web Browsing - Comes with Opera and IE.  IE works for \"mobile sites\". Opera tries to render actual web pages and does a poor job of it.  The omnia doesn't have internal memory dedicated to video / graphics so when you zoom in/out, the phone pauses before it re-renders the page.  It made browsing a chore and painful.The plus sides of the phone.1) Light - barely feel it in your pocket2) Internal memory - 8gb internal memory is a plus3) Camera - 5 megapixel camera takes great picturesIn closing, do not buy this phone, you'll be deeply disappointed.  The positive reviews must not have been reviewed by people that have used other smartphones.  This is by far the worst smartphone I've owned.  It's so bad I've switched back to my Motorola Q....", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "i900 omnia inputs", "Author": "Linden R.
