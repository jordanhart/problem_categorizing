Only good for talking; not so much for texting. It takes forever to text someone because you have to go through all the alphabets on just one key to get the letter you want, and unless you master that its tough and discouraging to send a text. the internet interface is a joke, this phone is old so thats why the internet doesnt look like the internet. Plus if you wanted to send a ringtone to yourself it wont save. waste of time on that. Please get a smartphone you will be happy spending the extra bucks!", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Motorola W385 Camera Phone", "Author": "D.
