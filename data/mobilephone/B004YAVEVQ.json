{"Reviews": [{"Title": "light weight, but a light-weight", "Author": "J.

Works fine with a T-mobile (3G) SIM card.=> Lacks a forward-facing camera, so you can't skype video calls.The screen has poor sensitivity; I need to really press hard with my fingernail.And, the screen is not multi-touch: with an iphone, to expand the screen you simply draw your two fingertips apart.  With this phone, you need to push (with your fingernail point) on a little \"+\" icon to expand the screen.  Screen resolution isn't as good as an iphone.All in all, it's a fine phone if light weight is more important than acuity.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004YAVEVQ"}}
