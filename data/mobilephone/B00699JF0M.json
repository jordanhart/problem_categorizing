{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid Phone", "Author": "R. Huynh", "ReviewID": "R2DNP36C66S8TV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a solid phone.I had a HTC Mytouch 3g slide for quite some time, I loved it, but it started to break down on me because there aren't any good cases for a sliding phone, so I tend to drop my phone quite a bit. But this was a nice change to go back to the originally bar type phone. It feels more solid compared to the slide which I was always worried if it would break into two pieces.My mom had recently got this phone for herself and she loves it. She has never been a smartphone person and wanted to learn. This is a solid phone. It has a sleek and thin design that'll fit anywhere! It's very easy to use that even my mom enjoys using it! She's been downloading apps and playing games non-stop for days! This phone is also very easy to read because the graphics are slightly different from the HTC Mytouch Model (they personally seem a little more kiddish for me) but my mom likes it because it's very easy for her to read the font and it comes loaded with a crap load of useful apps when you immediately turn it on.After shopping around for a new phone, I decided I'm going to take this phone. It's a relatively cheap phone in comparison to HTC and other various smart-phones. From what I notice so far, the phone meets my needs perfectly. The screen is sensitive, although, I think the screen cover I bought at the t-mobile store is very thick and it leaves smudges which makes the response time on the screen a bit laggy. I love the camera quality on this phone! It has two camera lenses which makes it very easy to take self portraits and regular pictures. You can also adjust the quality to make it really really clear. The audio speaker on this phone is amazing. The best yet out of all the smartphones I have tried so far. It's crisp and clear. I downloaded the Pandora Radio app and was listening to Jeff Foxworthy stand up and I could clearly hear every word even though it's volume wasn't maxed out. Lastly, the homepage (after you unlock your phone: there are many different ways to unlock your phone now, not just patterns) makes it very easy to rearrange applications because a grid pops up which makes it very easy to align your applications and organize them towards your own convenience.The processing speed is definitely a step up from my old Mytouch 3g slide but it's slightly slower than its HTC counterpart. I do have another pet-peeve about this phone so far. There are 3 buttons on the bottom of the phone (menu, home, and back) that the lights turn off after 30 seconds, I tend to use my phone at night and sometimes my fingers accidentally presses the wrong button which makes me either drop the phone call or close an application that I was using. Another minor flaw I found on this phone is text messaging. I came from a physical keyboard phone to a digital one, so it's relatively hard for me to adjust (though i think I'm getting the hang of it). The swipe on the keyboard isn't as fast or accurate as it's HTC counterpart. So I decided to just use the one letter android/ipad type keyboard. Lastly, the homepage (where it lists all the apps) is like an organized mess. They have several different types of layouts (categories, pages, & list). All of the apps seemed to be out of place because the phone automatically places the apps in random spots (e.g. I downloaded some new applications and I have my layout on \"pages\", the new applications are placed directly at the last page while the rest of the applications are in alphabetical order. It didn't bother me at first, but when I started to download more apps and couldn't find them it started to become a little frustrating.Despite the little pet-peeves, the only reason why I took a star off this phone is the battery life. It's crap. The battery is fast to die even if you don't use any application or change various types of settings. With straight usage, the batteries would only last about an hour or two at best. If I were to use it on and off, the battery life would double, but it's still not enough and you would have to charge it again and again.Overall, this is a solid built phone. If you're new to smartphones then this is a great or have financial difficulties like me (a college kid) this is a perfect alternative. It's fast enough to play games without too much lag and offers everything at a fraction of the price compared others. The phone looks aesthetically pleasing and the best part, it's very very easy to use. So even a beginner, like my mom who had no experience using updated technology, can learn after a few days of just browsing through its many features.I hope this review helps for others in their search for a quality phone!", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "WORST PHONE EVER...AVOID!", "Author": "fezzman", "ReviewID": "R6BYMQMPHSA2X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am basically on my FOURTH LG myTouch, all of them have had the exact same issues.  Eventually I spend the countless hours talking to T-Mobile and they send a new phone, which is no better than the last.Prepare to stare at a blank white or black screen while facebook or webpages seemingly never load.  The signal strength is the weakest I have ever witnessed (data, phone, and wifi).  The wifi is so poor that I can literally stand in the same room as a hotspot and watch the signal fade to nothing.  This is especially annoying if you are making wifi phonecalls, which the phone defaults to if the feature is enabled.  It always leads to a dropped call.  I have to disable wifi before I plan to make any phone calls.  But then enable it again after so I can use any other features, since the data signal is rarely ever strong.Texting on this phone will often test your sanity.  The keyboard has times where it is too slow to keep up with even slower typing.  Often times pressing a top row button will cause the keyboard to sputter and will leave a symbol rather than the letter. Sometimes it seems like the space bar wasn't pressed hard enough so you go back and hit it again.  NOPE! It was just too slow to register and now you have a period in the middle of your sentence.  The keyboard often locks up when changing orientation on the phone, leaving you with half of a keyboard.  It can take seconds up to 10 minutes for it to finally fix itself, usually I reboot before then.Everything on this phone will force close at some point.  Be ready for daily force closes.  Let's see: Homescreen, wifi, keyboard, messaging, any and every app, internet, even my gallery has force closed.The rear facing camera takes decent enough pictures assuming the lighting outside is perfect, there is no flash.  The forward facing camera takes grainy pixilated pictures. You would be better served having a kindergardener make you a portrait with fingerpaint, using elbows only.There is no 3G on this phone.  When, not if, your phone is not grabbing a 4G signal, forget trying to websurf.  On 2G some pages simply refuse to load.  Once this happens, it is hard to get any pages to load.  You are perpetually stuck looking at the white \"Website failed to load\" page.  Refreshing does nothing.  Short of a reboot, your surfing is done.The phone is often too slow to answer in time.  I used to use the security pattern to keep my phone safe.  I had to stop because sometimes the phone was simply too slow to even allow me to trace my pattern.  Even worse, sometimes the screen is too slow to simply slide the bar up to answer an incoming call.  Want to call a radio station to win that killer prize?  Prepare to have about 10+ long seconds between calls...and that is if you are lucky.  Sometimes I've only been able to call once before the outgoing call locks up.One of the phones I had received all incoming texts multiple times, sometimes as many as a dozen times in a row.  Imagine trying to have a simple text conversation where every reply kept repeating itself, sometimes hours after the conversation had ended.I won't even get into the built-in design flaws aside from pointing out that you cannot designate a separate sound from messaging or receiving emails.  One sound for all.  Boo.It is sad that when I call T-Mobile and identify these (and many more errors) that they acknowledge the phone is faulty and send another phone, which does the exact same thing out of the box.  I paid cash for my phone as I am on the prepaid plan.  Buyer's remorse period is over so I am eternally stuck with this piece of junk until I shell out for a whole new phone.  Sometimes I miss my outdated flip phone.  At least that worked as expected.One positive is that this phone, with a D30 case, is virtually indestructable.  If you are foolish enough to buy this phone, invest in this case.  There will come a time when you will throw the phone out of a complete and utter sanity failure, usually followed by a string of F-bombs.  A day does not pass that I curse this phone and the T-Mobile rep who recommended it as a \"good\" phone.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for 1st Time Smartphone User", "Author": "Bryan", "ReviewID": "R1X2CERU358IW9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is very great for the first-time smartphone buyer.

It was my first smartphone, so I really didn't know how to optimize my experience.  Watching friends use their other smartphones and iPhones made me think that my phone wasn't awesome, but I realized very recently that if you pair your phone with the Google Apps store (with all of the free apps; they are very similar to those in the Apple store), then your phone can go from mediocre to awesome overnight.  I downloaded a new internet browser (Opera Mobile was the fastest for my phone), a few music apps, some games, and voila!  My phone is wonderful now.  I use it for everything.  I have the Kindle app (free from Amazon) and read books on the go.  The Amazon store app is awesome for online shopping and great for reading reviews before you purchase in a store or online.  Basically, every company worth doing business either already has an app or will very soon.  It's making my experience so much better than it was before.It's still not as fast as my friends' iPhones, but it is a great phone for the price and the options to upgrade make it comparable.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pay a little extra for a better phone", "Author": "Joshwin P", "ReviewID": "R3PCUDRH0IGDZH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Where to begin.  I picked up the phone as part of an upgrade deal T-Mobile was offering.  This was my first smart phone, and felt miles ahead of my old slider phone.  Was I ever wrong.To start, the basic browser on the phone sucks.  It would shut spontaneously while trying to read an article, and at times, the entire phone would reset.  I had to go onto the Play Store for another browser.The phone itself feels like it is generations behind, repackaged in a shiny box.  I attempt to open the camera to snap a pic of the kids, and I'm sitting there, waiting.  Waiting for it decide to display the icon for my camera, and then waiting some more for it pull the app up.  If I attempt to access the menu, half the time, it sits there, scanning everything.Then, there are the updates.  This thing seems to do it at the most convenient of times...  Like when you're TRYING to make a call.  Most devices, this wouldn't be an issue.  Not with this phone.  It bogs down the system to the point it won't even pull up the phone functions.  If you're lucky, it'll actually call a number out of your contact list, all the while, not showing any indication of it actually placing a call.On more than one occasion, I have had the system crash, completely bricking the phone, forcing me to take off the case and remove the battery.  This once happened while I was trying to call 911.I would recommend staying away from this phone.  If money is an issue, you're better off either waiting for a special for some of the higher end phones or keeping it \"old school.\"Out of the 14 years I've had a cell phone, this is by far, the worst phone I've ever had.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for a couple months, terrible after", "Author": "Sean Bennett", "ReviewID": "R1UZ8AK022N2R6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was my first smartphone, from the beginning it was really fast the internet worked great, my apps ran really fast, but a couple months later it started to act weird, it runs incredibly slow now, the apps glitch out and run slow, it takes for ever to text, whenever i exit an app the screen is just the background pic and nothing else, an to add to the phone being slow, tmobile is terrible, so right now im an looking to switch to Verizon, im waiting for the Galaxy s4 to come out, and im looking for a way to make my termination fee cheaper, $200 is ridiculous, especially since the service has been terrible", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good not Great", "Author": "Sandra V. Mott", "ReviewID": "R2ESY2QHT72794", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my son who's a college student. He uses alot of apps and he texts more than calls. This phone is NOT for that. He constantly has to clear memory sometimes even doing factory reset is necessary. We've had to have it replaced 3 times already because it just starts acting possessed when you have too much going on at once.  T-mobile has been great replacing the defective units but we can't get anything else until this is either out of stock and discontinued.  I would recommend this phone if you just want it for calling and you clear out your messages often.  Apps have to be kept to a minimum even with added memory of microSD card. Touch screen works great, phone works great. I'm keeping the phone and passing it on to one of my other children that don't use apps as much. This phone would be great if it had more internal memory that's the only real problem it has.

Exploding Ford Pinto bad.This is my SECOND LG myTouch phone -- the old one simply quit working, and the replacement -- in many ways -- is far WORSE.NOTE:  If you return your LG phone under warranty -- the replacement phone no longer has a warranty.HERE'S JUST SOME OF THE REASONS TO AVOID THIS PRODUCT:1.  When people call me, the phone won't always let me answer -- it just hangs up on them.2.  When people text me, the phone sometimes applies a \"default\" date to the text -- most often, Jan 5, 1980 -- so it immediately becomes an \"old\" text.  And yes, you read that right: January 5, 1980.3.  Other texts get delayed for HOURS (which may be a T-Mobile problem).4.  Some apps seem to not be compatible with this phone -- MOST notably -- the one for my BANK.5.  Many -- if not most -- phone calls can not be made without doing a \"hard re-boot\" first.  So, instead of calling your neighbor, it's actually faster to walk a mile or so over there.6.  Accessing Facebook is hit-and-miss -- sometimes the phone reboots of its own volition.7.  I have called LG Customer Service so many times -- the last time I spoke with them they said, \"There's nothing else we can do for you, sir.\"  It's nice that they're polite; it would be even nicer if they were COMPETENT.There are MANY other faults with this phone -- it's my own personal hell.  Yes, I know, I know, as far as personal hells go, it's not that bad.  But, I always have the knowledge that, should I need to say, call 911, the call won't go through.  And that's just scary.I would LOVE for some enterprising attorney to file a class-action suit against LG for marketing such a horrible -- and potentially DANGEROUS -- product.If I ever buy another product from LG -- then it's my fault.

That is confusing and a little mis-representation.  In fact I have owned both of the My Touch handset by HTC and LG.  I have not owned the Huwaei My Touch as of yet.  The HTC is heavier and bulkier(is that a word) I found the LG my touch to be lighter, sleek and the display was more vivid than the HTC My Touch 4g.  The HTC was a better phone, more well constructed but not as pretty.  The seller needs to put up the right picture to reflect exact what item he or she is selling.

It has no flash for the camera, what seems like a small memory (my internet kept force closing saying \"not enough memory!\") I had to replace the SIM card numerous times due to some manufacturer problems, and the screen isn't very big or clear.
