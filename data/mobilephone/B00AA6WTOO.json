I don't understand the negative reviews. If you want a cheap, functional, handy little phone, this one works just fine. Yes, it comes set up for Spanish speaking users. If you go to a local store to buy a SIM card (required), they can show you how to change the settings so the prompts are in English, or see my directions below. The manual is completely useless, but this is not a very complicated device--really, you can figure it out yourself. I have used these phones a little here without problems, and will post an update after the trip to let you know how they worked in Europe. NOTE: you have to use a tiny precision flat-blade screwdriver, or similar small tool (a coin is too thick and your fingernail will be ruined), to take the back of the phone off (to access battery and SIM cards), and you have to be very careful to really snap the back panel back on ALL AROUND the sides and corners of the back of the phone. It can look like it's on and then you press some more and hear those positive clicks that let you know it wasn't properly attached, but is now. Long battery life, good at holding a charge.Changing the Interface to English:Press the top part of the left hand rocker switch (press the horizontal white line) to select \"Men\u00fa.\" Use right side of the large center rocker switch (click the right arrow five times) to move to the second screen of the menu and highlight the picture of a wrench and sprockets.

It IS a good phone, don't get me wrong, but I've determined it's really not suitable for me because I live on a small ranch and am outside every day for several hours at a time.  After the initial frustration of trying to figure out how to work the phone (because the little booklet with microscopic lettering doesn't really explain the basics), I've found that  I can't put the phone in my pocket because the slightest pressure causes it to dial.  I even bought a hard leather case with a belt clip but that didn't work either!  I think I've got the phone itself pretty much figured out but using it outside is not gonna work.  I'm 65 years old but definitely not \"elderly\", and I need a phone that I can carry with me outside.  I don't want a smartphone or anything with all those bells & whistles.  I just want something that's simple, easy to use, and has a good antenna for picking up signals in our rural area.  This phone has not dropped a single call yet.  Plus, it's got an incredibly long-lasting battery whereas my old phone had to be recharged every day, even when only used once during the day!
