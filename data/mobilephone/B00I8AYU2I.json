{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally a full featured android that fits in my pocket", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NPRZ8HPKTF54", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've gone through 4 smartphones in the past year- all the others went the way of craigslist in the first few months.I travel too much to bother with a cell phone contract and just do pay-as-you-go, but I need a full featured android which fits the bill of \"iphone slayer\" while fitting in my pocket and having the battery life for a transatlantic flight.. and waterproof. can't forget that.  This is the first of the lot that has met all my requirements and after 2 months I'm loving it.The only downsides I've seen areA) the waterproof door covers don't convince me that they will continue sealing 100% after a year of opening and closing to charge every night.  I plan to get around this through buying an external Sony Docking Station which won't require the door to be opened.B) lack of 3rd party accessories- this phone hasn't caught on in the US, and I'm not even sure if it would be available on contract there, so the 3rd party accessories like the Lifeproof Case, etc. aren't there", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "xperia z1 compact = iPhone killer", "Author": "Stefan", "ReviewID": "R1FOADVY9C9GOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am using this phone for 3 weeks and so far and it has frozen twice only :-), it has recovered it self though.... Why is this a positive? When it froze, I was really pressing opening, closing apps and buttons and scrolling all over the place, actually I was trying to overload it to see what will happen. a.k.a. hard core responsiveness test. It held fine... by normal use the phone don't freeze of course and is very very very responsive. As responsive as any iPhone... I tested it! I also have Samsung tablet and if I would do the same test of \"responsiveness\", the tablet won't survive it and freeze until restarted.This is my upgrade from nokia E6, too bad that nokia stopped the Symbian development. I was thinking to get an iPhone since the price is about same, but the battery life on iPhones is poor. - this phone is a iphone killer. I had the honor to test out Win8 phone and let me tell you that it is useless and I was most happy when I returned it back to the shop...I don't understand why the compact version of Z1 is not on sale officially in US in Tmobile or ATT etc... this could be a cash cow...One of my priorities was the battery life. with my normal usage the phone last for 2 days and on stamina mode even 2.75 up to 3 days (if I stretch it) which is close to what my old Nokia E6 was capable of. It says that the phone can be in stand-by mode for a week, never had the time to test it, but I will one day :-)...Second was the phone/display size. just perfect. I don't like the big phones....Third: open to all GSM, 3G, 4G frequencies (global phone). I am in OR on Tmobil network, and LTE/4G, 3G works fine on this phoneFourth: FM radio and Free offline world wide navigation.Overall: The phone is a solid build as described in other review. I put screen protector and cover from the day one, just buy it together to have the phone look new longer. I read that the display and phone back can be scratched easily so I just prevented it from occurring.I am not app fanatic, so don't have too many all kinds of apps on it, but I am using Skype, Free offline Navigation most time and for general web surfing. I prefer to use mobile web page for yahoo, facebook rather than an app for it. I don't mind the extra log in/password... The FM radio is nice feature that I am using daily instead of interned radio. Saves battery life and data too.I also have avast anti virus (free edition) and think about to upgrade to premium 15$ a year.Camera is definitely an upgrade from what I had, but if we need to take nice good quality pics, we use the DSLR camera and not a phone, but it is nice to have that handy. It says it has 21Mpx, but it can't compare with the DSLR of course.I also use this phone at work to sync my 2007 outlook calendar with the phone calendar (need those upcoming meeting reminders especially in meeting back to back..) I am using the exchange account setting sync over company wifi, to do that, which is fine. I know that there are apps out there that can do that too wireless.I will post an update in few months.I definitely recommend this phone over iPhone or any other 4in-isch smart phone.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Almost got it right - Updated!", "Author": "Jason Wang", "ReviewID": "R2GKAFER5CLWXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a week of use:I still really like this phone and stand by my 5 star rating, here's some things I've noticed after a week of use:The Screen- It's 720p but honestly it's a non issue, using larger 1080p screens for the past 2 yrs I don't notice a difference I would think Sony will stay with 720p for the Z2 compact and up it to a 4.5in screen.Battery life: If you have 4.3 out the box I wouldnt recommend updating it to KitKat the battery life just isnt as good it will still last you a day to a day in a half on normal use you should be able to get 2 days with normal use, it really depends on how much you value battery life.Screen Size: This is probably the part I'm most torn about, while I love the size when I turn on the phone I can't help to think the screen is just a tad bit small, I wish the side bezels were thinner something that will most likely be addressed on the Z2c. The issue is the on screen buttons take a good amount of screen space while not an issue on the home screen since they are transparent when you open apps they become black and take up valuable screen space making it smaller. May not be an issue to some but just wanted to point it out, if you're coming from a iphone or something similar it shouldnt be an issue but coming form a G2 with a 5.2in screen there are times where I felt the screen was a bit small.Phone Speaker: It's okay, it sounds a bit muffled to me I wish it was more clear volume is okay but overall it's pretty average.Headphone SQ: Very good not quite as good as the Z2 but you shouldn't have any complaints.Software: While Sonys skin is nice there is a lot of bloat for an unlocked phone, it annoys me that there's so much Sony / Xperia junk on here that you cant take off. I have a sony bluetooth headset and it forces me to download the app in order for me to use it, it also appears in the notification tray even after you disconnect it and turn it off the only way to remove it is to go to app info and click force stop. May not be an issue again but just wanted to point it out.Call Quality: Havent used this phone too much for calls about 2 hrs total? But havent had any complaints, audio quality through the phone is just average could be better could be worse.Overall I'll stay with my 5 star rating since this is the only phone of it's kind in this form factor I'm happy with it 80% of the time and the other 20% the grips bother me. The Z2c should be out soon if you want to wait for that hopefully within the next few months but once again it will probably command a hefty price tag like the Z2 around 650-700 at launch in that case the Z1c will be cheaper and I'd probably still recommend the Z1c in terms of value.  If you can afford it I'd wait for the Z2c and see what they come up with but if you chose the Z1c you will most likely be happy with it.Update: Reordered it New Z1c Impressions:I ordered the Z2 and while it's an awesome phone I felt as if it was too big barely I may get it again when the price goes down but as of now it's too big for me sometimes for everyday use...So I decided to give the Z1c another try and wow a lot of my impressions have changed.I'm pretty sure I got a different region this time as the box was different this one had the Brazil Fifa soccer logo on the back the 1st one didn't as far as I can tell the screen on this one is better, looks less washed out (Sony as well as other manufactures are known to use different LCD panels). The build quality also seems better on this version, the back doesnt feel as plasticy or cheap it feel much more premium. This makes sense since some people experience flash bleed issues when taking pictures due to the plastic backing where as some people don't the only explanation is that sony uses different plastic on some regions phones than others.These were two of my main gripes with the phone and makes the $450 price tag a bit more reasonable, if you're not happy with the version you get I suggest you return it and reorder it you may get a different regions and be happier. The Z1c right now fills niche that no other phone can fill there is no other \"compact phone\" that has flagship specs. Is the phone perfect no, the Z2 compact will most likely be my perfect phone I cant wait for it to come out...but it will most likely be priced similar the Z2 which is 650-700 initially so it will be a while until the price comes down in which I don't think it's worth the price difference. Overall I am really glad I decided to order the phone again I guess 2nd times the charm!Also side note: I'm not sure if I'm going to upgrade to kitkat some users have reported worse battery life after upgrading to kitkat while some have no once again people think it could be some regions phones. There's a thread on XDA worth checking out Sony is supposed to release an update next month, I also noticed this with the 1st phone I had where I was pretty disappointed with battery life after reading all the glowing reviews (that phone had kitkat preinstalled already)I've been following the Z1 compact for a while and finally decided to give it a shot once amazon had prime for it, I have to say there's a lot that Sony got right with this phone and a few things that they didnt. I've used the Z1 and felt it was too big and am currently using the LG G2, I wanted something smaller and more pocketable so I gave the Z1c a try. I'm sure everyone's watched and read reviews so I'll skip all that stuff and go straight to what I noticed.The screen, while it is improved it still isn't up to par with the G2, HTC One or S4 for that matter for some reason colors look a little washed out to me. While it is a good screen, I would say it's not on the level as the top tier phone (or last years now).The camera, the camera takes good outdoor pictures but just okay indoor ones I used the superior auto mode but honestly was a little disappointed with the camera, I use auto since 99% of the time I dont care to mess around the manual settings.Build Quality- This is probably the biggest disappointment for me, using the Z1 I was impressed by the build quality it felt premium and solid the Z1c on the other hand feels some what cheap (imo). The front feels hollow it's hard to explain but it almost feels plasticy the Z1 and HTC one have a harder screen that feels like glass, if you've used the iPad Air the front feels like that. The back is also really disappointing, Sony opted to use plastic instead of glass not sure why since the Z1 was glass and it was one of the 1st things I noticed. If this is supposed to be a no compromise smaller flagship it wouldv'e been nice to have the same build quality as the Z1, while it does look nice the in hand feel felt a little cheap to me but once again that's just my opinion.Battery life- Coming from the G2 and reading the reviews I expected really good battery life the phone has KitKat now and maybe that may contribute to the battery life not meeting my expectations but I would say it's good but not as good as my G2. I didnt have it on the charger and sleep for about 7 hrs I woke up with it dropping 10%. Hopefully it's in new phone mode right now and the battery improves over time but as of now I would say that battery is good not great, it was at 90% at 9 am now its at 67 at 1 pm I was in an area with bad signal so that has alot to do with it was well but ill update this after more time.SIgnal strength- I'm using Tmobile and while coverage isnt the best there's areas where I have less bars then I would have with my G2, not a major deal breaker but could be an issue depending where you live.Overall I will most likely return it I paid around 460 for it and I don't feel like it's quite worth the money, if it was at a lower price point around 350 then I might keep it but for now there's too many other better options in terms of full size phones I can get for that amount. It's a good phone but I would suggest waiting for the Z2 compact and hope that they address some of the issues.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Definitely the best compact android phone on the market", "Author": "br", "ReviewID": "R367WNPY26VMEN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Aesthetically this looks like a slightly rugged iphone 4s. The added ports on the side distract from the physical design, but more than make up for it with their function.The waterproof gimmick works and adds a sense of security to the device. I set it next to a sink while I washed my hands at a bar. The water pressure was a little high and it sprayed all over the phone, so then I washed it in the sink to get the water spots off because I could. Then I went and dunked my phone in beer because I could and washed it in the sink again because who cares... not this phone. Hell, I was so blown away with the waterproof feature that I made phone calls from the shower. It's great and I hope this is the future.I get about two days of regular use with the battery saving feature on.The front label can be removed so you don't have to see a logo every time you check your phone. The phone looks much better without it. If you remove it, I highly suggest buying a different screen protector, as the one included with the device is there for a reason. This thing will likely scratch and maybe shatter without it. However, there are drop test videos on YouTube and I have a feeling the screen might be the last thing to break if dropped.The processor/ram/storage specs are modern and it shows. You don't have to wait while opening or closing anything and I've yet to find a game it struggles with.My biggest annoyance with this device is the stupid sparkle effect when you swipe to unlock the phone. It's lame looking and super FABULOUS if you know what I mean. My second biggest negative is the bloatware which comes prepackaged with the phone. The bloatware is Sony's way of showing you that brand loyalty is dead, that Sony really doesn't care about their image anymore and that you're just a stupid consumer. Apple doesn't do this, Nokia doesn't do this and the last Samsung I used had much less bloatware. So annoying.Even still I think this is the best compact android phone on the market.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "So fast o.o", "Author": "Nathacha V.", "ReviewID": "R6FIPJOSVU0MA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its perfect!

The camera is phenomenal, I can see the screen in direct sunlight at any angle no more running to the shade.
