{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Only Rugged Smartphone in its class!", "Author": "Ricdesan", "ReviewID": "R24WBV7EQJY2CW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I went looking for a rugged phone to replace my previous 6 year old dumb phone I found very few options in the marketplace. This was one of them and it was ten bucks cheaper than a dumb phone alternative I located and multiple hundreds cheaper than any other rugged smart phone made.Sounds like a no brainer right? Well, I wouldnt say that as it requires patience! Patience for the 3 weeks to ship from China, time to load the machine with all you want and time to root it and get it to your liking. Part of the issue is even though this phone will take beating unlike few others, its hardware is last gen for sure even though the 1GHZ processor runs Andriod 4.04 snappy it only has 256 each of RAM AND ROM. Now thats not so bad when it has a 16GB micro SD slot to go along with the dual SIM set-up. But its easier knowing that going in and also knowing that a post over at xda-developers.com will help you with the root process via a Chinese app!Once I rooted it,swapped out the slower 4GB class 4 SD that comes with the phone for a class 10 8GB card and loaded the biggest to smallest apps first over to SD and the ROM required apps last this little phone really came into its own. The 3.5 bright screen is just big enough while still fitting in my front pocket and the limited memory will keep the system running smoothly with apps Battery Doctor and Clean master to keep things optimized. It only occasionally prompts me for low RAM yet always frees it up with the help from the utilities I mentioned.Finally, the two cherries on top relate to battery. With moderate usage it will easily last a day between charges and then some! Light usage will stretch that to 2 days and stand by might be a week. The last cherry is the company ships the unit with 2 batteries for that same price. You have to love some value added when not expecting it.So to wrap, this is THE ONLY sub $200 rugged smartphone made that will bounce off the pavement and go swimming with you while still providing a sweet little android environment like the big phones do. If you are willing to take the time, this phone has no competition ... period!", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone did not work properly & NOT waterproof!!", "Author": "Cruiser", "ReviewID": "R3SKU6SA56H6R5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Recvd. this phone & instruction only in Japanese or Chinese.

It was 2 weeks instead of about a month of waiting till I got it which was amazing. They told me they couldn't send a second battery with it which I didn't even know one came with the phone and so they gave me some gifts like a memory card and other stuff. The phone is great and is probably by favorite phone I've had.

It took about 2 in a half weeks to get to me though estimated at a months time, but I noticed it shipped from Hong Kong! So, not bad for the distance, and the seller kept contact with me and my concerns. Just being curious as I don't know much about these types of phones... why 2 SIM spots?So... if you are expected a replacement phone that's open, try products sold by Amazon only so it'll be no longer than a week or few days .... Also, the camera for this phone is ok, not good quality in dark and no flash, and yes it has a memory slot as well.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "i received the tv damaged", "Author": "jose luis guerrero", "ReviewID": "R1CBV5EOYAU4DT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i received the tv damaged screen was heading, as I can not give me warranty for this product.
