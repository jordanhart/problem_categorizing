{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone, but can't upgrade Windows Phone OS", "Author": "Marc", "ReviewID": "RC78MQO16GIN2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I actually like the phone.  It's very fast and doesn't freeze up unless I'm messing around with a bunch of apps at the same time.  It has a feature to close all open apps at once which is handy.  I love the touch screen and the camera is awesome.  The business card reader works great and adds the card info to your contacts.  The main problem is that Microsoft does not support Windows Mobile version 6.5 anymore and the phone can not be upgraded to Windows Mobile version 7.  You can't use any of the online or PC tools that are available with version 7.  Basically the only way to get files on and off the phone is to connect via USB then cut and paste.  The 8 GB \"My Storage\" folder is great to store music/videos/docs or whatever, but all the programs are preinstalled on the smaller memory on the phone and there is no way to move them to the \"My Storage\" folder.  I think I may have to return this phone simply because of the discontinued operating system.  I want to know I can get support if I need it.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Omnia II 2 I920 Touch Cell Phone", "Author": "Shadow Hunter", "ReviewID": "RQLRK4GNHLKAQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone works great on the pageplus system-a lot of functions-the no contract pay as you go makes it a very affordable phone for the kids!Excellent graphics and very easy to use.5 star rating!", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "I am liking this phone more each day", "Author": "Mark Twain", "ReviewID": "RCQE08S458N7Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Coming from an easy OS like Android, this phone seems a bit daunting to use. Though if you are average intelligence or better, it will grow on you like a fine cheese. The operating system starts becoming like second nature, but takes quite a bit to get used to. There are MANY functions that are intricate, so if you are computer Savvy you may really appreciate it. If you want something simple, this is not the phone for you. Get an Iphone or Android. Overall I really like it. We didn't want to be under contract, so I bought one of these and a palm pixi plus to activate on teh Page Plus system. Overall both great phones without contract. Fully operational on the Verizon network under the Page Plus. We cut our cell phone bills from $129 a month to $42 after all taxes and fees with these phones. Can't be happier and this one is mine.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "so far so good.", "Author": "Walter", "ReviewID": "R3EBC0IAOJXPRE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "recieved my samsung omnia 2 I920 touch screen with 3g. so far its pretty cool phone. a little slow but then again i have had worse phones. im enjoying playin with the phone atm so many things and options this phone has. im very happy with how good the touchscreen is.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "fantastic", "Author": "whit whit", "ReviewID": "R2E3L78G6IEMK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this item was very good i really love my new phone when i thought it didn work they were very helpful in gettin me some assistance i strongly  recommend them", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worst Phone Ever", "Author": "Maro Shin", "ReviewID": "R3JUAMX27LP2NR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got this phone in March 2012 because my LG Cosmos Touch stopped working. I got this phone and things were great for the first two months, then that's when things started to happen. First, I noticed I had to restart my phone about 1-4 times depending on my phones mood. Second, the phone would freeze and sometimes I had to wait 5 minutes just to open up the main menu. Around August, I had to send the phone back because it stopped working completely, and I got a refurbished one. Worked great until a week later. Same problems, same things. Now, my haptic feedback (vibration) is all gone. So I'm missing text messages and phone calls and I don't notice them until 5 hours later.Pros: Very nice camera/video quality. I feel like I almost have a Nikon or a Kodak in my hands. Decent call quality. Good battery life (I'm out from 8am and I don't charge it until 2am) so enough to last the whole day.Cons: Slow and glitchy at a lot of times, Opera Browser is slower than I thought, IE is way worse, and all the other things I said up there", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "pleasant", "Author": "rjkklassen", "ReviewID": "R3HO0WDUN2YQ65", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the seller is amazing and so is the phone. i got it for my wife and she loves it no complaints at all. the seller is very generous. my phone that i got from got shattered. and he is giving me another one i appreciate that. i love my phone as well great seller great phone", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Omnia II", "Author": "RW73", "ReviewID": "R3A02AWLW4VB0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone with nice features.

Connectivity is still good, but after a year I'm ready for a better pay-as-you-go phone.  The initial lack of intuitiveness was a bit annoying--also later, I noticed that its kind of slow and I still don't use all the features which I don't need anyway.  How slow is it?  I didn't really notice until I measured the timing of receiving and sending the same mail against the Optimus, which I keep as a backup. For a phone with a weak, frustrating connectivity, the Optimus sends and receives faster and is more intuitive than the Samsung.  The best thing about the Samsung is that it uses Verizon's 3G network so you don't have to be near a window or run outside in your underwear to get a signal like with the Optimus.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "It did not work", "Author": "Ana C. da Silva", "ReviewID": "R28UE60MINFE3C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone after I read all the other reviews and I wanted a nice phone without contract.

First of all Verizon does not really support this product any longer, so trying to get help with anything is like pulling teeth from Verizon since they no longer sell this phone themselves.  If you are getting this phone just to make phone calls and send text messages it's great.  If you are trying to download apps and do other things with this phone, then this is not the phone for you.  This is a Window's based phone, which is not very much with the program like Android, iphone, etc.  I had to go re-purchase a current Verizon phone in order to download apps and get all the full usage out of the phone I needed.
