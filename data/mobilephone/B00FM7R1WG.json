This phone and the current crop of Tracfone Androids use CDMA technology (model number ending with \"C\") and use Verizon network. Their old phones use GSM technology (model number ending with \"G\") and use AT&T; or T-Mobile network. Even though Tracfone may say this phone is available for your area, check with local friends and family to make sure there's good Verizon signal where you plan to use this phone before buying one.* There are now over 700 answered questions for this phone, covering many subjects.

I played with it for about 4 hours and so far I like it. I've been customizing it, downloading apps and testing them. It runs every app that I have on my Galaxy Tablet and just as fast. I tested it as an Android device, using my home Wifi. Haven't activated it yet, so haven't tested it as a phone, except testing the supplied ringtones which are very few. I'll provide an additional review once I've had a chance to test it as a phone.I transferred my contact list over from the LG840 using bluetooth. Piece of cake.I ran a couple of aviation/navigation apps using the built-in GPS receiver. It's very good. Sitting in my house about 6' from the window, it picked up 7 satellites.========== Part 2 - Added on 10/14/2013 ============This part of my review focuses on how the Valet performs as a phone.I activated the phone on Tracfone web site according to the included instructions. It went smoothly. Got assigned a new phone number with Verizon. You'll need to activate the phone with a time card, or a credit card to buy time, or transferring time from another Tracfone. The Android phones don't come with the typical 20 \"starter\" minutes.I set up voicemail by holding down the \"1\" key on the dialpad, then followed the instructions to record my name, greeting, and select a PIN number.I live in the city and on a high elevation. The phone usually gets 4-5 bars out of the maximum 6 (haven't seen 6 yet). Sound quality of calls is very good. The volume is also good.The phone has a lot of features: speaker phone, mute, call holding, forwarding, conference calls, etc. There's a small LED near the top of the phone. You can set it up to blink if there was a missed call or incoming text message. This is helpful because you don't have to \"wake up\" the screen to see if there was any missed call or message.When you receive a call, there are 3 options: answer, reject (goes to voicemail), or text. If you select \"Text\", it switches to a screen where there's a \"Quick Response\" message that you customized previously (like \"Can't talk now. Call you back later\") and you can fire off a quick text message to the caller.The contact list has all the typical features: multiple phone numbers, email address, different ringtone, etc. You can assign multiple contacts into Groups. That makes it easier if you typically sent text messages to a group of people. You can also \"join\" multiple contacts into one entry. I get calls from various sales people and fund raisers. Since the phone doesn't have an \"Ignore\" list, I joined those people into one contact named \"Unwanted\" and assigned a low-volume \"ding\" ringtone to it.When the battery level gets down to 15%, you're prompted to connect a charger. It takes 2 hours to bring the battery from 15% to 100%, using the supplied A/C charger. You can also charge it by connecting to a PC USB port, although I haven't tested to see how long it takes to get a full charge.The phone appears to use very little battery when it's on standby mode. I turned off Wifi,Bluetooth, GPS, Data, and used the Task Manager to shutdown all tasks, only the phone function is on. For the last 10 hours, the battery level went down 1%. So, it may live up to the advertised standby time of 11 days.I hope this is helpful. Feel free to post questions or comments. See the Questions & Answers and the comments below for a lot more technical information.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my needs/wants and well worth 99 bucks", "Author": "Jason Burke", "ReviewID": "R15CMNMS4WVBRZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Are there much better Android phones available right now? Of course there are. There isn't, however, anything that I would more highly recommend for a Tracfone user who wants to use it for the things that I want to use mine for. A few years ago, reps at some major mobile service providers would almost become hostile at the mention that I wanted to have a smartphone but I didn't want to have a data plan. They would parrot off some stupid lines about not using the phone to its potential or some other garbage as justification for the fact that their company would not allow you to activate and use a smartphone without paying for their expensive monthly data plans. I have had a plan like that before, and I only ever used data a few times a week. For the most part I have access to wifi 90 percent of the day, and I do like to be able to pull out my phone to check email, look something up, and use/update a few apps that I like. ItIt was not worth 30-40 bucks to me to have all kinds of available data usage I would never make a dent in. I felt like someone wanting to grab a quick snack like an apple and the only options available were pricey all-you-can-eat buffets. Between that, not being super fond of texting (so I made no dent in my available texts either), and having a Magic Jack at home that I use to make any long or business type calls, even my relatively low-priced grandfathered plan from 2006 was looking like a huge waste of money. So I switched to Tracfone and have been more than happy that I did. I spend less than 20 bucks a month for 2 phones and always carry over some unused minutes. One thing I kept saying I would love was to be able to have a smartphone that I could use with wifi when I wanted, load on useful things like a graphing calculator (for Calculus class that I am currently in, backup contacts with google, and have the option to use a little bit of data on the occasions where I wanted/needed to do something and didn't have wifi available all without a contract or hefty monthly fee.A couple of weeks ago I went to Best Buy and bought the ZTE Valet right after they because available to use on Tracfone. I typically expect to find a few things that disappoint me when my expectations are high for something inexpensive, but I can honestly say that every criteria I had come up with before buying the phone was exceeded. I can turn off 3g easily and not worry about accidentally using my data. I can download and use every app that I used to use on my deactivated Samsung Galaxy S (which I occasionally carried in addition to a cell phone needing two separate devices to be able at that time to do what I now can plus some with one), it is very fast and responsive (even if I had paid twice as much my expectations would have been surpassed), the camera is way better than the other phones I used with Tracfone before (nothing amazing but certainly good enough to post online or set as a pc screen background), and the battery life is fantastic. If I have it on but use it infrequently (maybe 10 minutes of web on wifi, 5 minutes on the phone, and 10 minutes just doing whatever) it will last several days without needing a charge. One day I used it to download apps and updates over wifi, surf the web, used the calulator for over 5 hours (you get a lot of homework in Calculus), and I had wifi turned on the entire day. This was 3 days after I had last charged it and I still had almost 40 percent of my battery left at the end of that day. I don't expect this to last forever, but this is about the best I have seen so far with any phone.I can't say anything regarding the call quality, so look elsewhere for that. The reason is that I just don't make many calls, and in the last 2 weeks I haven't actually used it to make any. I do see bars all day long, and I have ignored a few spam calls from some number that I recognized from answering on my previous phone with the same number. Texting works great. For me, splitting my tripled minutes into 60*3 = 180 minutes, 180 texts, and 180 MB has been great. Switching and transferring my old minutes (I had 420 minutes and got 420 minutes + 420 texts + 420 MB) was simple as well. The main thing that makes this a good fit for me is that I was already in these usage habits before (though using one phone and one Android device), so upgrade was 100 percent an enhancement. What I don't use my phone for is to constantly let everyone know where I am all day long, update and alert me about updates to every stupid thing that happens on Facebook or Twitter or whatever, check in on foursquare or whatever it's called, or anything like that. I have a TomTom in each car, but I did make sure the navigation works with google maps (it does just fine) just in case. If you are the type that actually could burn through multiple gigabytes of data every month, this phone would probably still be good, but what you care about and what I do would just be different... so you would likely find something else that better met your needs (though not while still using Tracfone).The point of this post (as I am not going into any technical details) is to help people who might have about the same usage desires as I do to make a decision by confirming a few areas that I considered when deciding if I would get the ZTE Valet. I would give it 5 stars for what it is and for what it isn't even if I had paid as much as $300 for it. I have yet to find one thing that causes me the slightest unmet expectation. Sure, it would be nice to have a front camera, awesome speakers, HD video capture, etc. but then I would have paid a lot more than 99 bucks and I would be a lot more worried about something happening to it.I have one piece of advice for anyone that decides to get this phone. Unless you really want all of that google stuff (like Google+ , hangout, and half a dozen other things) running because you use them all the time, save yourself a lot of Ram and battery power by disabling them. To do so you have to remove the updates first. Just hit the menu button, go to Manage Apps, scroll through to find the stuff you don't plan on using (make sure you know what things are at least though before stopping them), then remove updates and disable from there. Advanced TaskKiller or something like it is helpful too for keeping stuff off that you don't want running when you aren't using it. There is nowhere near as much of this junk as you get when you buy a phone from a dealer with a contract and it comes full of bloatware, but I still prefer to maximize my battery life and speed.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent as an Android phone but spendy for what you get.", "Author": "Living Life In The Midwest", "ReviewID": "R38IW935WCK9YK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Opening Remarks (review is below):First I must say cell phones are not new to me. I worked in the cell phone industry and that is why I use pre-paid service. That is all I am going to say about that and I will not respond to questions about that subject.Pre-paid is just a way to separate money from people who don't want to commit, can't commit or want the option to quit when things turn against their favor. With pre-paid you get cut-rate service at a cut-rate price. Those not familiar with pre-paid should know that when you call customer service you will not get a call center that is in the USA.Pre-paid companies were started by the big name cell companies as a way to sell service to everyone, pre-paid companies will cut corners with service to keep their costs low. With Tracfone I suggest creating an online account with them on their official website. From there you can activate new phones, register the phones to your account and transfer your numbers and minutes to new phones you buy without having to call tim-buck-too and speaking with someone that does not understand you very well. Try to do as much as your own problem solving and customer service as you can though their website to avoid their frustrating customer service reps.Review:This phone is Android yes: Cut-rate Android. It is limited to 3G speed for Data on the cell network. If you are expecting state of the art you had best go straight to the service providers like Sprint or Verizon and buy a phone there. There is a wall charger and usb cable included. The usb cable can be connected to the wall charger and phone to charge the phone or the phone and computer to charge the phone or transfer files like mp3 music to the phone.It has a single core 1ghz processor. It is not fast enough to run fast paced games or even multi-task. In fact a task manager runs in the background and closes the apps you minimize. Those familiar with Android know that on most devices apps stay open until the user \"swipes\" them off the screen. The app manager however will keep media apps open, like playing music in the background, while you use the device.The GPS works fine with the Google Maps app. A little slow to update changes and position at first but I don't know if this is due to the 3G data speed or the single core processor. It became more responsive as my trip went on. I only tested it once in a Midwestern area with no tall buildings.The Wi-Fi is fast and responsive with impressive range. It will also alert you by chime when you are in a free (unsecured) Wi-Fi area. Be very wary of using unsecured Wi-Fi as man in the middle (where you passwords and user names are recorded) attacks can happen.On mine, it has Internal Storage (for apps and user data) of 2.34GB available to use while a tiny bit is already used from the factory. The task manager app shows 386.31 MB of total RAM, just running factory installed apps I have 114 MB free. Again those familiar with Android know that 512 MB of RAM is pretty much the minimum you would want on a device that will run more than one app at a time with 1 GB or more becoming standard on top shelf phones.This phone comes with an SD card. Mine came with a Toshiba 4 GB class 4 card. The SD card can be used to as additional storage for ringtones, video files, etc. This ZTE Valet allows moving apps to an SD card from Internal Storage. Those familiar with android know some apps can be moved from Internal Storage to SD cards if the programmers of the app allow this and only if it is a program that does not automatically run on startup like the Facebook App, Twitter App or Outlook App do.The camera is low end 3MP. It requires a high amount of light to get photos that are not grainy. Indoors photos looked grainy no matter what I did except for when the subject was lit well from sunlight through a window. The camera is somewhat slow to respond, I don't know if this is because of the camera app or the single core processor. I have seen slower cameras on I-phones and top end Android phones though so all in all it isn't the slowest to respond. When I held the phone really still until I was positive the picture has taken the images had the best results. The camera features a flash but no \"automatic flash\" option. If I want the flash to be used I have to manually turn it on. It is also not a traditional flash but simply a white LED light that illuminates the subject, at close range only, when the shutter button is pressed and continues until the photo is completely taken. In complete darkness the flash had a maximum usable range of 5 feet for me and at that distance only illuminated the center of the photo. The images of faces taken with the flash on looked white washed.A top feature I have not seen before was an option to turn the Data (3g) on and off using the Power Control widget. A one click simple solution that makes this phone the ONLY pre-paid Android to consider. The Power Control Widget on my phone was installed on the first left screen. For those not familiar with Android, swiping my finger from left to right on the home screen reveals this screen. I removed the Android Tips widget from the home screen and moved the Power Control to the home screen to more easily use this option. This option turns off the phones ability to send and receive data over the 3g network thereby stopping any data usage when not on Wi-Fi. Of course you have the option to also turn Wi-Fi off with this widget too.This is a feature sadly lacking in other cell phone companies, so much so that people resort to putting their phone in Airplane mode (all data flow and calls are stopped) when apps like email, twitter and facebook start using too much of their Data plan. I've gotta give it up to Tracfone for this feature. A+ on this! So, if you leave  Data in the off position in the Power Control and only turn it on when you want updates on you accounts (email, twitter, facebook etc.) you can minimize how much data you use. Again I cannot stress how useful this feature is. If you are coming from another pre-paid or traditional cell phone company you may have found yourself exceeding your data plan when your phone was updating your accounts around the clock. On other phones it was possible to positively turn off your data for most apps by turning off Sync but this was often overridden by some apps and also stopped updates from coming through on Wi-Fi.Voice calls are fairly clear with a little bit of an \"overdrive\" or clipping on louder setting. The rear facing single internal speaker produces loud and relatively distortion free rings and music. It is however somewhat easy to block the speaker when placing it down on its back cover (like you normally would) especially on softer surfaces like seat cushions.The issue of \"Minutes\": Those familiar with Tracfone know that most newer standard phones give the buyer triple minutes. That is if you buy a 60 Minute card you get that tripled to 180 Minutes. Text messages on these phone were billed at .3 and more rarely .5 minutes per text.I have only bought my minutes for my ZTE Valet online via the Tracfone website and this is what I can tell you from that transaction. My 60 Minute card got me 180 Minutes of talk, 180 Text messages (incoming and outgoing) and 180 Mb of 3g Data. So, as you can see Text messaging is being billed not out of the Minute pool with Valet Android but instead out of its own Text pool. For me this is not welcome. I currently work where I am not allowed to take voice calls or make voice calls. I can text. I use about 20 texts a day. On my old Tracfone that was 6 Minutes that were deducted per day. Now it is 20 texts that are deducted from my text pool. So for me a 60 minute card will last about 9 days of texts at 20 texts a day (180 Texts divided by 20 Texts per day = 9 days) but I will still have 180 of voice minutes and 180mb of Data. With my older triple minute phone a 60 minute card would have lasted 30 days of text only at 20 texts per day (180 Minutes card was = to 600 Texts and 600 texts divided by 20 per day = 30). :-/I cannot give 5 stars to this product because its single core processor, its small amount of RAM and its current price (as of October 14th 2013). Virgin Moble pre-paid (a Sprint company), StraightTalk (a Tracfone and Walmart company) as well as Net 10 pre-paid (a Tracfone company) currently have Android phones with similar tech specs for under $50. Virgin has a $35 a month plan for Android with 300 minutes of talk and \"unlimited data\" a month, StraightTalk has a $45 \"unlimited everything\" a month plan and Net 10 has $50 \"unlimited everything\" a month plan.I did not deduct any stars for the new Minute/Texting pricing model. This phone is not using GSM carriers like previous Tracfones and instead is activated using CDMA carriers. CDMA carriers play by a whole different set of rules than GSM carriers and Tracfone has no control of that. I am almost sure they are the ones moving Tracfone to this different pricing model for Android on the ZTE Valet.Final thoughts:There is not Minute bank display on this or any Android on Tracfone. You must open a web browser like Chrome (via Wi-Fi or 3g) and go to: mobile.tracfone.com You will be asked to enter your phone number. You do not need your serial number. You will, after about 45 seconds, get a text message that does not seem to count against your text balance, giving you your remaining Minutes, Texts and Data. Of course if you are on 3g and not Wi-Fi this counts against your data balance. Don't forget to close your browser and turn of your Data on the Power Control widget when you are done with this or you it will continue to use 3g and it will count against your data balance if not on Wi-Fi. I have even been able to access this website on my home computer and receive the text message on my phone, thereby not using any data on my phone.Also install Norton Security from the Google Play store. This app is currently free for its basic mode and works very well. It works better with a Norton account (access to one additional feature) and the Norton company says it even works better in the paid version but I have not tried.If you are giving this phone to a child Install and configure Norton Family parental control. It will block websites based on your childs age and send you an email when they try to access websites that Norton deems inappropriate. I have not used this on the ZTE Valet but do have it installed on my children's Android tablets and fine it does quite well.~~~~~~UPDATE October 21st 2013~~~~~~~~~This is a review with the intention of helping others make a decision based on my experience with the phone and my experience with a great many cell phones from working in the industry. This review is in no way intended to belittle tracfone users as a small number of people may think.Battery life is astonishing with the ZTE Valet when I have the 3g Data turned off. The battery is lasting at least 3 days 2 nights on standby, with wi-fi on, only a few minutes of voice calls, 3g Data turned off and about 10 texts per day (with some apps installed)! I would typically see standard battery capacity Androids getting around 28 hours of standby with the same apps installed but with the 3g data on (because on those phones it can't be turned off).The apps I have installed are: Outlook, Facebook, Google Calendar, Astro File Manager, Chrome, Easy Reminder, Alarm Clock Extreme, K9 email and Norton Mobile Security. All apps work flawlessly. I have set my polls and updates for these programs to 1 or two hour intervals and disable Email Push.I have had no random reboots or lockups. This is pleasant as even name brand phones of the lower end spectrum are susceptible to this.Some odd things to report however are:-Calendar reminders and calendar alarms do not go off all the time when the phone is asleep (screen off and processor in low power mode). This has not been a much of a problem once I disabled the preinstalled ZTE Calendar program and installed that standard Google Calendar program. If I ever get this totally worked out I will update again.-Easy Reminder does not seem to work accurately more than 80% of the time. Easy reminder fills the gap in the Android OS where it the phone only tones once when a text message is received there is no \"5 minute reminders\" like dumb phones have where the phone tones every 5 minutes or so until you check your text message. With Android if you don't hear the tone the first time you're sorry out of luck until you wake the phone and see on the screen you have a message waiting. Easy Reminder sometimes misses new texts or sometimes thinks there is a new text when there is not. Easy Reminder app is prone to work in this odd manor on some phones or installs and my ZTE Valet is one of them. Reinstalling the app until it works right is the only solution for most people that want to use this app.Cases for the ZTE Fury and ZTE Director are supposed to work with this phone. The case I got for a ZTE Fury fits perfectly.Voice dialing has never, ever gotten my numbers correct, even in total silent surroundings. My last Android phone had an almost perfect record for dialing correctly. I am referring to number dialing where I speak the numbers I want my phone to call. Voice commands rely on a fast processor so I am wondering if this single core processor isn't the problem there. However voice dialing has always been perfect when I say the name of the person I want to call, eg \"call home\".Google contacts and calendars sync by default if you enter your Google account when setting up this phone or add it later through the settings>accounts menu.Microsoft calendars sync into the ZTE calendar app or the Google calendar app though the Outlook app. You can also sync your Microsoft contacts through Outlook and see them in the Android contact app but not edit them. I have written many articles on work arounds for this that basically tell the user to set the Outlook app to only sync the calendar and then add your Microsoft account as a Corporate account and set that account to only sync your contacts. You can then edit your Microsoft contacts through the Android contact app. This also works fine on the ZTE Valet.Youtube videos play fine over my home wireless internet connection. No lag or drops. I have not transferred video files to the device to play so I can't speak to the ability to view those videos.I disabled Google Handouts/Talk, Google +, Google Magazines, Google Books, GMail and Google Movies without any problems or adverse affects to the phone. This is an \"expert\" tweak that probably isn't even necessary given that this phones Task Manager automatically shuts down unused background apps.Last for my update the price is dropped by $10 since I bought mine. This brings the phone more in line to what I think it should cost. If it dropped another $10 I would say this is 5 stars far and away one of the best deals.~~~~~~UPDATE October 27th 2013~~~~~~~~~The data cable is standard usb 2.0 (1.0) size and the phone end is USB B micro This is the style they have used for the last few years on most, but not all phones and tablets. It is slightly smaller and distinguishable by its two small spring back prongs that help secure it into the phone. So if you have a 1 amp or higher charger with this end, you can use it.While waiting almost two weeks for my screen protector to come the screen somehow got scratched with a brushing type of scratch. Again (not trying to insult anyone here) but with cut rate phones they use plastic screens that scratch more easily than gorilla glass screens or scratch resistant screens. Be sure to buy a screen protector. I bought one for the ZTE Fury and it fit fine.By uninstalling and re installing the Easy Reminder app two times with restarts in between I have gotten it to work perfectly. At its current price as of October 27th 2013 I give it 4.5 stars. I don't think you can get a much better phone than this for Tracfone even in the Samsung for Tracfone.I am a very happy customer with this phone.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Won't Work Everywhere so Beware.....", "Author": "University English Department", "ReviewID": "R31QZ80ULHP7QO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Was a great phone--I had fun with if for a week. Then we traveled outside my home zip code and all service stopped!! It went back to the store and I went back to my original Tracfone. Tracfone androids run use the CDMA network and Tracfone does not buy CDMA usage from everyone (i.e., Cellcom in NE WI).

You add minutes by using cards or by buying them from TracFone's website. On this phone, when you add minutes, you will also get the same amount of data minutes in megs. For example, I have a triple-minutes-for-life phone, so when I add a 60 minute card for $19.99, I actually get 180 talk minutes, 180 text messages and 180 megabytes of data. Also, whenever you add minutes, you automatically get 3 months of service. All these minutes and messages and megs carry over to the next month. (My older Tracfone has a service end date sometime in 2016 from all the cumulative carry overs) :)Some basic specs:1 Ghz single-core ARM7 processorHas Android Jellybean (4.1)The MicroSD slot accepts expansion cards up to 32 gigabytesCamera has a flash.The phone has hardware GPS, even though it doesn't mention it in the specs.Separate camera button on the lower right of the phone (which means it will be upper-right when you rotate the phone to take pictures)This phone doesn't have the usual Tracfone custom firmware, typical of older Tracfones, with a pre-paid icon for managing your account and a constant \"minutes remaining\" on your Home Screen. You might not even think it was a pay-as-you-go phone at first glance because Tracfone has done a great job of staying out of the way of the phone's operating system and just handling the billing. Instead, Tracfone has an App on the Google Play store that you can use to check your balance and add minutes. The App also has a widget that you can place on an adjacent home screen if you want to do a quick check on your balance. Another nice thing is that if you have WiFi access, the phone will automatically use your WiFi connection for anything Internet-related instead of your precious data minutes. (Talk minutes still go over the phone network, unless you're using Skype or something)The phone works fine as an Android 4,1 Internet tablet right out of the box thanks to the built in WiFi. You'll get an \"activation needed\" message each time you start up the phone, but I was able to play around with it all day, setting up my Google Play account and trying out Apps until I got it home. I'm quite happy with it.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great casual use phone", "Author": "Zeke", "ReviewID": "R1IBDR1VRBKZD7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's face it.  The majority of people who buy this ZTE Valet are doing so because they don't want to pay a high monthly fee or lay out a lot of up front cash for a CASUAL USE phone.  After doing some extensive research I am convinced that this Tracfone deal delivers the best bang for the buck, and Tracfone subscribers now have a good entry level smartphone which has some features that other more expensive entry level phones are lacking, including Android 4.1.One of the reasons I bought this phone was to have some Pandora smooth jazz playing over wifi while I labored outside raking leaves for a good three hours.  Well, it worked flawlessly.  No matter where I was in the yard the music played without a hitch, and my guess is that the farthest distance was some 70 feet from the router with the router being on the opposite side of the house.  The manual says it can work up to 100 meters which is over 200 feet.  Not sure why, but I'm just not experiencing the wifi distance problems that others claim they are having.Another reason I bought this particular phone was that it allows you to move some apps to the sd card to free up some memory, and not all android phones have that option.  My understanding is that freeing up memory helps the unit run quicker.  I've moved a handful of apps over to a 32GB card already with no issues.  Before installing a new card I think you need to copy the stuff that was on the 4GB card included with the unit over to the new card and then add apps, music, photos, etc.One important note for those who are considering upgrading their Tracfone to the ZTE or any of the other androids.  The airtime promo codes do not work on the androids.  So, if you already have a non-android triple minutes phone you may want to load some airtime on it using a promo code to get some extra minutes.  Then when you activate your android all of the minutes will carry over to each of the three buckets (phone, text, data).  I didn't have a triple minute phone, but I had no issues transferring minutes from my old phone and adding one year of service with triple minutes to the Valet.I've only had the phone a couple of weeks, but so far so good.  Making and receiving calls with no problems, wifi connectivity is fine, apps are running okay, navigation seems simple enough, etc.  Anxious to try the GPS, camera, and other features that are loaded on this phone.

This is a 14 year old girl's review youre reading, because i wanna let parents and other teens know that if you want a decent quality smart phone, this is a good one to get. My parents are like most: they hate plans. My entire family, down to my grandparents, use Tracfone. With this device, you get alot for the amount. The service is decent, but the wifi isnt great. The apps are run nicely, but take this as a warning: there is no way to check your balance, unless you go download an app for it. Just search tracfone balance on the play store, and it will basically sent you a free text stating how many minutes, MBs of data, and texts you still have available. The camera isnt bad, but i advise getting a camera app. You can go on many soical networking sites too, so thats a gain. All in all, this is a nice phone that would work well with anyone who wants a smartphone. Buy it for your kids, you wont regret it.

We both like these phones. The reception is good (which is more a function of the carrier than the phone). It works great for texting, phone calls and Internet access. I was able to download some nice apps from the Play Store and they all worked as well as any other phone I've tried. I like that I can listen to a song or a speech and turn off the light. My old HTC would not let me do that. I like the fact that I don't seem to be accidentally pressing a button that disrupts my video. We seem to make fewer typing mistakes when texting. The phone is a comfortable size for fitting in your pocket or purse. Not too small. Not too big. My use is pretty much restricted to calls, texting, Internet access, GPS-enabled directions. I cannot make any comments on gaming performance because I don't do that. The processor is a Qualcomm MSM7625A 1 GHz so I suspect it will not be suitable for high-performance needs. I have not used the camera so I can't comment.

I never thought I'd see the day.  That alone is worth 5 stars.  The phone is not great, but it's completely acceptable and is capable of doing all Android functions; it's not locked down like other Tracfones.  It's 100x better than any older Tracfone, but compared to a Nexus 4 it would rate like a 1 or 2 stars, but that's not the point.  My rating is based on the value and functionality.Call quality is great even though it almost never shows more than 2 bars.  Wifi signal is not so great - you have to be careful not to block the internal antenna while holding it or you can lose the signal even in your own house.  Screen is pretty grainy for 2013, but looks fine for my purposes.  Camera is fine only as a utility; don't plan on a beautiful slide show of your family vacation.If you are a heavy texter and plan on using the phone's native texting, this is not the phone for you.

Its like a handheld Computer!", "Author": "Discman", "ReviewID": "R2COGRH2EJZUHA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was always curious about smartphones but couldn't afford the monthly plans that they all demanded with their carriers. Once i saw tracfone FINALLY began to offer android phones at such low prices, it was time to upgrade. Of the 4 models tracfone currently offers, the ZTE Valet is the BEST and most technically up to date model. So if you're considering a tracfone model, look no further.After having nothing but 3 \"dumb\" tracfones previously, the experience with the ZTE Valet is like night and day! Its a true, full-featured, Android smartphone. It has all the features of the nicer models out there, just at a lower-end(slower cpu, less ram, 3G instead of 4G, etc). So you're getting the legit smartphone experience with this unit and its pretty great!Apps that you'll want: Once you register your Gmail account and get access to the google play store(which will auto-update all your bundled apps to make them current), you'll want:#1- Tracfone my account. This app lets you keep track of all your minutes, text, and data easily, and also comes with a widget(basically an accessory that comes with your app) that lets you place the full display on your home screen. So you'll always know how much you have left. Only issue is it does not update in real-time, you have to click the green \"update\" button. After a few minutes tracfone will send you a text(at no charge), saying how many minutes/text/data you have left. And a few minutes after that, your wiget's display will update. Great app!#2- Big Buttons Keyboard: If you have larger hands like i do, or even small hands, this app will work great to ensure easier typing. It makes the buttons/keys MUCH larger and easier to hit, and lets you adjust the keyboard's height and how much of your screen it takes up. Free also. Great app!#3- Your phone will come with a power widget! Just a black rectangular bar that allows you to switch on/off your: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Data, and brightness level also. This is another essential widget that should be placed on your home-screen alongside the tracfone display. It lets you keep track of what is on and off at all times, so that you don't waste your data and or battery life senselessly with features left on.#4- Standard Android Browser (with the little blue globe icon). Yes, this phone already comes with this app built-in, but its out of date. So you'll want to disable that one and download the latest version off the Google Play store. This is one of the best Android browsers and makes surfing the net and watching videos a breeze! Some important tips to remember: #1- the zoom feature, which is basically placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them apart. Makes browsing pages and tapping small links much easier. You can also double-tapp on an area to make it zoom in on that spot. #2- In the menu you can enable it to \"request desktop site\" or the mobile version. One may work better than the other, depending on the website so keep that in mind. For example trying to play videos on the desktop version of youtube works poorly, but the mobile version plays videos great!I could go on but overall this is a excellent, entry-level android phone. Highly recommended!", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally", "Author": "Greg", "ReviewID": "RPBF7H49WJ82S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "[I've changed my opinion of this phone, so skip to the end if you want to read that first].My Tracfone before the Valet was a LG 500g. Even though it's an older featured phone, I liked the physical keyboard, it offered a lot of settings, and it really wasn't a bad device. The alarm on it was surprisingly loud and it worked even when the phone was completely off, saving more battery than sleep mode! I tried the LG 840g (before the Android rumors were leaked), and I completely hated it. I wrote a review here on Amazon about that as well.But enough about those phones. I looked at the 4 new Android Tracfones and easily narrowed it down to the ZTE and Huawei. I didn't choose the Samsung because I don't like Samsung as a company, and the ZTE and Huawei were slightly cheaper and almost the same specs. Why pay for more? The Huawei almost beat the ZTE, but I didn't like the skin they used for the UI, the fact it was 4.0, not 4.1.1, and it wasn't available as quickly. I would love an LG, but for some reason they're still on 2.3, and no news if there will be an update (so I'm guessing not).I've had the phone for over 2 weeks, since the first moment it was available to buy, so I can comment on quite a bit. It's a mixed bag, but the fact the OS is Android, not a custom made LG/Samsung/etc creation for Tracfone, is the reason why it's a good upgrade. I'm semi-new to Android BTW. I haven't used Android devices, but I am a general tech user and pick things up quickly. I also follow Android news because it's interesting and I knew someday I would be using a device, so might as well learn in advance!PROS:1. Even though it's a single core A5 processor, I've tried a lot of apps and they all work fine! I don't use anything heavy duty, or plan to, but some examples of apps I've tried without problems: various benchmarks (Antutu, CPU-Z, etc), Firefox, website app based browsers (Android Central, Reddit readers), The Weather Channel, Antek Quick Settings, and replacements for stock calculator, timers, whatnot.2. It's really quite easy to use. I don't have a history of using touch anything and I just picked it up. Everything - the settings, general operation, it's somewhat intuitive. Also easy was transferring my contacts via Bluetooth. My manual is still wrapped in plastic. Same for connecting it to my computer and using the ZTE JoinMe program to manage it - BTW, I do recommend installing it (install to your desktop first, then manually install the app to the phone using the file browser). It's another central control panel program on the phone and the desktop, but the desktop one brings a HUGE BONUS: JoinMe lets you change the default alarmtone! Can't do this in the phone, and if you use the default Timer app, you can't change it there either. Some timer app also use the default alarmtone, making you pay for the ability to use any other sound. Not anymore!3. The transfer from my old phone was mostly painless. I did it online, and activated it via their automated system without a hitch. But I say mostly because for a long time, MANY DAYS, I could not check my balance at all. I activated the phone easy enough, but I kept getting tons of \"OOPS!\" style errors. I just laid low, and it's not happening as much now; they seemed to have resolved it for the most part. I also received some free units - thanks Tracfone!4. Doesn't have too many ZTE modifications that I can see.  A ZTE program for managing the battery (don't even think of touching it, it changes sync settings, vibration, wifi, gps, data, Bluetooth, brightness, the whole works without even asking me), one for sharing files, and some widgets, but for the most part it seems to be pretty clean. Has to be too, given the limited internal storage space. You need an SD card to use this for the most part - almost all the apps I install or use go straight to it by default. It comes with a 4GB Toshiba one, but it's only class 4.CONS:1. Tracfone must have a phobia of quality cameras because it hasn't happened yet! The camera is the same as the past: better than having none. Still no autofocus, and pictures always feature color noise AND a nasty noise removal look. Plus the LCD screen makes it difficult to judge exposure to begin with, so even though you can adjust exposure, brightness, saturation, contrast, sharpness, the screen is just not good for photography at all. The screen also has a prominent blue color cast expected of low end LCD displays (if anybody knows what I can do to tweak this, I'd love to know). The display is ok otherwise for general usage. You can use the physical camera button to take a pic though which is convenient. No custom white balance and only one for artificial light.2. There is noticeable lag at the default \"Long Press\" lockscreen when unlocking it (even when unmodified). The circle animation to unlock never looks smooth - sometimes it doesn't do this though, and the animation is smoother and faster. The phone unlocks faster as a result too! I think it may be due to having WiFi enabled, as it doesn't do it as much when in airplane mode. I've also noticed sometimes when starting the device, it will not display all my apps... not sure if it's the CPU or the lack of RAM, but no matter what, you may experience moments of slowdown. Phone takes quite a bit of time to load too... 46 seconds to get to the main screen, then another 35 seconds to finally show all apps. Takes about 4-5seconds to turn off.3. The speakerphone is not as loud as it should be. Using it while it's put on a tablet or in my pocket is not really possible, even at max volume. This isn't quite the kiss of death, but it's something that really annoys me. The alarm or multimedia volumes are quite loud, so why not when I'm in a call? I want my speakerphone option to be more like loudspeaker or intercom, that way I can actually do something else at the same time and still talk.4. The default ringtones, alarmtones, and wallpaper are bad. I actually like the notifytones it comes with, but Android won't let you use them as ringtones. I wish I could just port all the LG sounds over. So I'll be working on sounds or extracting the default sounds to use them anywhere.5. Possible poor antennas. I never seen more than 3 bars for reception! Also, the Wifi is... well I haven't tested it out yet, but I have seen a lot of stations go in and out. It picks up on a lot of stations, but most are poor reception.6. And if you love to text, you've got left in the dust - texting is now 1 full unit, not 0.3 like before. You might as well give somebody a call since you can say a lot more in that full 60 seconds.OTHER:1. Doesn't show your balance and service date on the main screen. I missed that a lot... however on October 18th, they introduced an app that performs the same functionality! WAY faster than using any browser, but somewhat annoying - every time I check my balance, no matter what way, I always get an automated text message from Tracfone (costs no text unit) which shows the wrong totals. Sometimes it's like 6 in a row, seriously the phone won't shut up and I keep getting nonstop notifications.2. I'm always suspicious of Google products given the NSA Prism scandal. So when I set this up, I made sure to look for phone home/Google account/location things. If you want to do that too, look in Settings: Data Usage (turn off auto-sync data), Location Services, Security, Backup & reset, Accounts (lets you sign out to not use your Google account when using Google services), and the Google Settings App.3. Vibration is turned on in a lot of places by default. For the keyboard, for the physical buttons, etc. It's one of the first things I changed.4. The battery is ok... no clue how you could ever get the 11 days standby, unless you installed a bunch of apps to shutdown everything but the bare minimum required for the device to function. I leave mine in airplane mode a lot and keep Wi-fi and Bluetooth off unless necessary. Don't have any numbers to show, but at least it seems to recharge not slowly (I wouldn't say fast, but it doesn't take forever unlike some electronic devices).5. I've already left it outside, RAINING, and it still works perfectly! Water got past the back cover and basically everywhere but the screen, but there's zero damage at all! I didn't have to do any tricks with rice or heated car windshields either, I just dried it off, laid it upside down for a while, shook it a lot, and later sprayed it with some isopropyl alcohol and repeated (to make sure that the dissolved particles in the rainwater were removed).Overall, I'm satisfied with the phone. Of course, if Tracfone had some higher end phones or BYOD, I'd be all over that instead, but the fact that it's still Tracfone makes up for it. I'd rather pay more for a low end phone and have a super low quarterly bill, rather than a nicer phone with a monthly plan that can't even begin got match Tracfone's prices. You can always buy a phablet or tablet and bring that alone with you for a better experience - sure, you pay more, but you don't have to worry about the carrier and there's a lot more options.UPDATE [Feb 21, 2014]: I'm dropping two stars from my review since things have gone downhill since it. The phone is just slow and freezes in places it shouldn't. 2D games with basic motion causing the entire touchscreen and physical buttons to be non-responsive. I had to pull the battery out to get it working again. I have even seen lag in FLAPPY BIRD! When something of that nature hiccups, you know something deep is wrong. A couple times there wasn't even any screen when I attempted to wake it up... completely black. Had to pull the battery then too. While the accidental bath I gave it doesn't help, I've read several other people with the EXACT same symptoms so it's not me. I won't not be surprised when the phone eventually dies either, so if you do get this one, be sure to backup and regularly (I used Holo Backup by omegavesko). The price has dropped so fast as well, less than 6 months in and you can already find it 50% off retail value. That does not inspire confidence. Firefox is pretty slow in general, 3G as well. 512mb or the CPU are to blame for most of the problems I think. To give you another idea of the slowness, sometimes I will click something and the screen just goes black, not like above, but like it's saying \"Loading, loading... nothing to show you anymore since the animation/loading screen already ran it's course, so you get some emptyness.\" The screen size, while I still don't mind, limits the choice of 3rd party launchers I can use too - the fonts of most end up looking microscopic. The ZTE's Mifavor really has more favorable font size. And the speaker now is just SO LOW... I can hear if it's quite, but otherwise I have a hard time, even on max volume OR speakerphone. I was in a car on a paved road yesterday, nothing special, and I could barely hear it (no speakerphone).

Its a huge upgrade from my tracfone Motorola EX124G which i only got 4 the looks but now i got the real thing & its pretty awesome. Its nice & responsive & i had no problem w/ activation. Everything transferred over & Yes wifi is subpar but i love the new data cards. They r really cheap...i like the 750mb for $20. Call quality is good in my area, i was able to transfer contacts flawlessly. I store all my music, photos, video on the microSD card & all went smoothly. I downloaded the Tracfone app that tells your amount balance. I can pretty much dwnld anything on this phone. All the apps i've dwnld load fine. The camera worx OK...the jury is still out on that flash. Its just an led lite not quite flashy but it'll suffice. All in all, its a pretty cool phone. Its not an iphone or SG4 but it has 4.1 jellybean & does what i need it 2 do.

Androids are very customizable so if there is something that you dont like or isnt user friendly for you, you can simply change it to your liking. So here are a few cost-saving tips that i'd like to share: 1) to save data, make sure you turn off data when you're not using it. Depending on what you've downloaded some apps may be updating or running in the background i.e. weather apps and that uses data. And you may want to check the app manager or download one so you can see whats running & kill it if you not using it. 2) this is one of my faves: the Opera Mobile browser helps you save data; it compresses web pages which reduces the download size and improve page loading time and reduces bandwidth consumption. There's also Opera Mini that works on java-enabled phones & tablets. I had it on my motorola ex124g and it ran flawlessly. Opera can show you the original size of the page, the received size of the page & how much data you saved in %. It can also link your bookmarks, speed dial tabs & search engines between computers and phones. It will let you save web pages for offline reading. I used this feature alot on my old phone, for example, if i wanted to check out some recipes for dinner or read a review, I would search for the page, hit the saved pages tab, confirm and i'm done. That would save me a few minutes on my air time compared to if i would've read it in real time.  Also to save data, try not to stream music, movies, etc too much unless you're on a good wi-fi network. 3) if you're running low on talk or text minutes or just want free try using something like google voice. I personally use google voice but i know textplus and pinger are good also.  I use a hotspot frequently & have a little over 900 minutes that transferred over so this phone isn't costing me much to run it at all & I absolutely love it. Hope this helps you save $$$ too!

Wife has limited needs and is loving the valet. It is still a good phone if you are not a heavy user. I miss the Android 4.1.First Review: November 5, 2013This is the third smartphone I have had - LG optimus V (virgin mobile) and Motorola Electrify (US cellular) are the others. I have been in search of an affordable smartphone ever since I went to VM from Tracfone. The VM $25 plan was perfect for my pocket but the coverage in my town was very bad. I gave up on them and went to USC - excellent service with relatively affordable plan - $70 a month (no texting), not bad compared to some plans with unlimited goodies but over $100 a month. With the tracfone zte valet, the max I will pay is $20 a month i.e. if I double my USC usage - highly unlikely so I a m looking at about $10 a month. I was able to port my number to tracfone easily - in less than an hour. This was my only concern before buying the phone since I did not want to change my number. A+ to tracfone for that. Now to the phone itself. As one YouTube reviewer said, this phone is just black. While he found \"just black\" to be boring, I think it is elegant. It is not flashy - that is what I like about it. The size is perfect for me. I find the 4 inch phones to be just too big.  As most reviewers have said, the wifi connectivity is a bit weak. I will not call it poor as of now since I get connection at work and at home easily. The available storage of 2.3 GB (internal) and 3.6GB SD card are excellent for me, and to many users. Pictures and videos will require more storage but if you want a phone for videos and pictures, this might not be the best since ZTE valet does not have auto focus. I did not buy it for these functions so I am all good but it wouldn't hurt taking some pictures sometimes. The dedicated camera button on the right hand side is great - some reviewers saw it as a negative but I like it. The only complain I have so far is the sluggishness of the phone. I have to tap everything twice to get a response which makes me miss my motorola, sometimes. But for $50-60 savings, I will keep on tapping twice. I believe tracfone will come out with a more responsive phone in the near future. With the savings I am enjoying, I wouldn't mind replacing my phone every year if something better comes out - but I don't have to. The main reasons I bought this phone is to make calls, check emails, schedule/keep track of appointments, and send about 10 text messages in a month. If you want a high-end phone, then look elsewhere. The zte valet is for those of us who do not use the phone for games, etc and live on a budget. Please note that, a number of reviewers complaining about this phone are new to android OS. Also, the number porting process could be confusing so make sure you know what you are doing.

It loaded fine, recognized my google apps already loaded (which I also own in amazon apps), BUT it absolutely would not allow me to download ANY Amazon apps to the phone. I'm not sure if there is something I need to do to allow it. It's not the first smartphone I have handled. I have it set to allow 3rd party downloads. I will keep working on it and post if I ever figure it out.Original: Let me start out by saying, a lot of the negative reviews are about Tracfone, not really this phone itself. I will review THIS phone, not Tracfone. However, I will make references to Tracfone service in comparison to use of this phone, compared to non-android Tracfones. A lot of people don't understand what Tracfone is. It is not the latest and greatest, nor is it meant to be. People who use Tracfone usually don't use their phones as often as those with unlimited plans. They also don't want a contract or monthly $100+ cell phone bill.I have been a Tracfone customer over 10 years. My most recent phone was a Samsung S390G. I loved that phone. There's something to be said about a Samsung. However, between that phone and something like an ipod touch that is wifi only, I got tired of 2 electronics to keep up with. I chose this android over the others based on it's processor speed, Android version, camera,and price.Activation was a cinch. I never had to call customer service. I switched my Tracfone phone number from my old phone to this one online without trouble. Be sure to follow the directions. Activating this phone was different from activating non android phones. Other users had issues with getting all of their minutes transferred to this phone. All of mine transferred. I had 950 minutes. I have in the past with other phones had problems getting all of my minutes, usually over 1000 minutes. May be it's the 1000 minutes mark that requires a call to customer service. This phone on transfer had 950 talk, 950 text, and 950mb when transfer was completed.There is a widget on the phone that tells you when your service date ends, how much talk, text, and data you have. There is also a Tracfone app with the same info that can be downloaded from the Google Play store. The widget puts all of the info in sight. The app has to be opened to get the info.I recommend getting the microsd card in before you even turn on the phone. It comes with a preloaded card. I upgraded to a 32gb card. It's just easier to switch before you start downloading than it is to try and switch after you have apps, music, videos already loaded.Phone is very responsive, works like any other android smartphone. I get good wifi signal, and multiple antenna bars. It is on a 3G network, which is a lot faster than other non android Tracfones. The screen is clear, sound is good. The sound can be loud enough I can hold the phone away from my ears and think it was on speakerphone. Everything works fine, just as it should. This phone is not the newest, with all the bells and whistles. But it is functional, it is user friendly, and it meets my smartphone needs. I have not had any problems with it, and recommend it to even an experienced smartphone user. The people I work with are always surprised when I tell them it's a Tracfone and what I pay for service. The one year plan is enough for me, so I get a good smartphone for $100 a year.

I couldn't be more pleased with this ZTE phone, which is perfect for my fairly limited use of cell service. I've accumulated a large number of minutes, which were transferred easily to the new phone, with the addition of messaging and data gifts from Tracfone. I have had no trouble connecting to my home wifi (as far as my back yard) or to several different public wifi services. Really I have only two small complaints--the screen resolution is mediocre, but I don't plan to watch movies on the tiny screen, so for normal use, it's fine. Also, the camera is mediocre (but it has a flash!) and is not autofocus, so no apps that scan bar codes will work with this phone, as far as I can tell.

ALL of the TF Androids are very entry level phones and as such be prepared for entry level performance.People look at the listed specs and note a 4 gig SD card but no mention of on board memory. Just for the record my phone after adding a few apps to it has 2.6 gigs of free space on the phone and well over 3 gigs on the 4 gig SD card that comes with the phone. With the size of the OS and what apps I installed I will speculate that the phone has 4 gigs on board and comes with the 4 gig SD. Not bad for a phone that is less than 100.00.When I first got it out of the box I put my GMail acct on it and started installing my apps. This bogged the phone down fast and for a short while I wondered if this was a bad phone, but remembering past situations even with tablets I just set the phone down and let it do its installs. After I was done installing apps I also downloaded the TF app that notifies you of available Call time, remaining text and available data, it also allows you to add time to your phone from the phone like any other TF, This app is very nice to have in the Google Play Store (GPS) since these Android phones do not have anything like it out of box.One person above posted that the Valet loses its connection to WiFI frequently and I have to agree, it seems to have a weak wifi antenna.While it would be great if this was better, it is not a game changer for me. My need for this phone is a way for my employer to reach me through the day. My boss gets on the phone, says what needs saying and is off. Little to no time wasted chatting. I suspect along with being very busy he is trying to save those platinum priced minutes that all cell phone companies charge for.A quick run down. It is a entry level phone so it has only 512 megs of ram, 1 gig processor and 4 gigs on board memory, touch screen is fairly responsive, it has a 3mp camera and flash on back and I don't remember the MP on the front. The back camera takes fair pictures. But only fair.Sound could be better, things are plenty clear but volumes could be louder. Again, entry level phone.In call....Everything seems to work just fine. In call volumes are fine, no echoes or reception problems, the phone is provided for by Verizon so if your in a good Verizon area you should be in good shape. But just keep in mind, if your current phone has bad reception in a given area this one probably will as well. My other work phone which I hope to replace with the Valet is a Straight Talk slider/android also covered by Verizon and the Valet has all the same drops that the other phone has. Seems Verizon just has few towers in some areas.Long story short, The ZTE Valet is a decent phone for the price. Remember it is a entry level phone at a entry level price and the phone is NOT loaded to the hilt with every bell and whistle. It does have Android 4.1 on it which is a plus and it does run fairly smoothly on a phone wit such low specs. This is a feather in ZTEs cap.One last note. My current monthly cell cost is 45.00+tax. And there was a LOT of that that was never used because it was strictly a work phone so it was used for 8 to 10 hours a day and then turned off for the evening and weekends.The Valet will allow me to cut the monthly price down to 20.00+ tax a month.I call that a win win. it will take 4 months for the phone to pay for itself and then it is pure savings after that, aprox 25.00 a month. and that is 300.00 a year I can use else ware.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good bottom of the line smartphone for low volume users", "Author": "DaytonaDan", "ReviewID": "R2JG99HGJ40RCZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It has been a long wait for Tracfone customers who have been longing for a real smartphone at an affordable price. But it's finally here, and is a pretty good one considering the low cost.  Yep, a full blown Android phone for less than $100. Believe it.  And with Tracfone's pay as you go approach, it's quite affordable -- as little as $7 a month if you are light user. Since you get triple minutes for life with this phone, that translates into about an hour a month of voice, 60 texts text and 60 megabytes of data. (This assumes you buy a $20 , 60 minute card every three months.) You can also roll over all existing minutes, which is a good deal if you have accumulated a lot over the years as I have.Now as you might expect, you are not getting Galaxy S4 or iPhone 5S grade hardware for this price. In fact, this thing is about as bare bones as it gets. Every possible corner has been cut to keep the cost low. Consider the screen, which is plastic, not Gorilla Glass, so is subject to scratches. It's not a super bright OLED but a somewhat grainy, somewhat dim TFT, which was state of the art about 20 years ago. Resolution is marginal but good enough in most cases. Tiny text designed for hi-res Retina screens falls apart and is unreadable. Touch sensitivity isn't the greatest either but works OK if you are patient.As for the CPU, it's adquate -- a 1Ghz. single core model that was common in other smartphones about three years ago. It gets the job done if you are not in a big hurry. Keep loads low by avoiding live wallpaper and turning off GPS and Bluetooth (yep, it has those and they work!) when not needed. If you run antivirus, pick one with low overhead. Or avoid it altogether.The most disappointing aspect for me was the lousy wi-fi reception. Wi-fi is essential for keeping cellular data use down. But this phone has the worst reception I have seen in any device. BGN compatilbility is listed in the specs but unless you are in the room where the router resides, you are lucky to get more than one or two bars  (and thats with a high end, dual channel Cisco router that works fine with all my other wireless devices). It drops to zero if you are more than one room away. And as other customers have reported, it tends to cut out a lot for some reason. Off, on, off, on.Cellular reception is pretty lousy too. I got a strong single with my old dumb Tracfone. This one shows one or two bars at best. Looks like they need to do some work on the antenna on this thing.Have not traveled so cannot comment on coverage although Tracfone supposedly uses Verizon and/or  Sprint for this CDMA phone so coverage ought to be good.Another gripe: The home, back and menu icons along the bottom of the touchscreen are backlit in very low light but the backlight turns off in normal indoor lighting (for some dumb reason) making them all but invisible. Memorize where they are because you wont be able to see them most of the time.Oh, and no 4G on this one either. 3G is it, which is probably good since you can burn through data quickly at 4G speeds. Stay away from streaming audio or video. Take my word for it. You can't afford that using this phone, unless you are on free wi-fi. 3G is fine for many other aps, which consume data in multi kilobyte chunks instead of multi gibabyte.For those who upgrading from an older phone, be patient. The phone number transferred quickly in my case but not the minutes, which meant I could not make or receive any calls for about 12 hours. Tracfone says the process can take up to 2 days. Plan accordingly.Bottom line: You get what you pay for. If you want a cheap smartphone that's basic but capable, and are not a heavy user, this is a good way to go. If you need more voice time or data, consider one of the other providers that offers a lot more voice and data for a flat monthly fee.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Valbethw \"Val\"", "ReviewID": "R39ZNYKXTMWECD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this.

We have been longtime Tracfone users.  As you can imagine, 5 cell phones in a household would be very expensive through a regular major carrier.  We average a cost of $10 per phone per month.Having the ZTE Valet opens up true access to android apps and the web as well as GPS mapping. I LOVE the easy ability to turn on and off Data, GPS, and Wifi.  Data is very cheap and manageable if you DO NOT access streaming music or Video thru the Data connection.  Through wifi, stream all you want to and it works fine. I stream Pandora and Netflix on this phone.  The phone has good wifi reception.  It is not as good as a tablet though.As I mentioned this phone truly opens opens up web access that previous tracfones attempted to do.  With other tracfones, if you checked mail or went to the web, you would eat up minutes as the phone slowly progressed.  Now the Valet accesses the web quickly and you don't use minutes.  So if it is slow, it does not cost you since you are only paying for data that passes through to the phone.  And emails and the web use VERY little data.  But if you want to stream music and videos using the Data connection like on an unlimited plan, then you should not have a pay as you go plan.  But I understand that Tracfone/Straightalk offer unlimited plans for around $50 a month.Texting is  very manageable but could get expensive if you have heavy texters under the new method of paying for minutes/text.  However, I would suggest looking into some of the free texting apps that use wifi/data to send a text and are not counted as texts through Tracfone.If you want to save battery life, remember to turn off wifi until you need it.  Also, out of the package, the screen goes into power saver mode way to quickly.  Go into settings and change the amount of time that must pass before it dims the screen.  Also, one quirk is that when someone sends me a MMS text with or without an image, I have to turn data on and click on the text before I can view it since it has to download the message using the Data connection.  You would think it could use Wifi but it won't.  Either way, it does not use much data at all to download the text.  If it is a regular text then you just get a text, but a multimedia message is different.There are many cases available.  Searching for the ZTE Fury case can many times give you more options at better prices.  The Fury case is an exact fit for the Valet.As you can read, just reviewing the phone is not enough.

The seller is very good, this is my 3rd purchase from him and all have been good phones.  They all still work, my first was the LG 800G, then I went to the LG840 as that had the wifi and now I have this one as it is an android phone and the google play store is available so it is possible to obtain all different manner of apps.  The Verizon cell phone service in my area is better than Sprint or AT &T; so I was happy to see that this phone is on the Verizon network.  I use this phone at my employment and until now the cell signal was very poor as the building is all metal and glass.  With this phone I usually get at least 1 bar and many times I get 2 bars.  With the other phones I could barely get 1 bar and had to be by a window in order to use them.  This phone came with a 4 gb card which is a big help.  The Bluetooth feature works very well and I was able to bring my contacts over from my LG 840G to this phone in 1 step, easy, easy!!  The camera on this phone is the best one you can get on any Tracfone and it even has a flash which is a plus.  I recommend downloading the free app so you can know how many minutes, texts and data you have left.  I transferred my minutes and service days online, however I had to make a phone call to have some of the minutes transferred.  Doing this change online the system only transfers 1100 minutes, if you have more than that you will need to call Tracfone but that was accomplished easily in just one call.  Be aware that with this phone you now have 3 different \"banks\"  the first is your talk minutes, these are tripled, so if you buy a 60 minute card you will get 180.  If you send or receive a text that comes out of your \"text\" bank and not your minutes.  You then get 180 texts if you buy the 60 minute card.  The \"data\" bank is when you go online using 3 G.  Tracfone will deduct from your \"data\" bank when you go online using 3 G.  You get 180 mb of data when you purchase a 60 minute card.  If you find that you use the data more than anything else and your data is used up before your service days you can buy a data card from Walmart or it can be purchased online just like the regular airtime cards.  If you go online using wifi then there is no deduction from your \"data\" bank so it is better to save your \"data\" bank for when there is no wifi available.

Never before did I imagine a functional Android phone could be maintained for as little as $7/month on a cellular network that is very reliable.  Yet, here it is...and I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to test the Android waters without spending a fortune.Let's be clear what this is not: A high-end phone with a data plan that allows you to stream audio and YouTube like it's going out of a style.  It is not a Samsung S4 with a snappy processor and hi-res camera.  If you're looking for that type of Android experience, you'll have to spend hundreds more -- even on a prepaid device.  What the Valet does do, however, is remarkable for its specific price point.The 1 GHz processor can run basic apps just fine.  Anything that is demanding (like games or HD video) will obviously challenge the Valet's hardware.  Just out of curiosity, I played Temple Run Oz since that game has fast-paced 3D graphics and relies heavily on accurate touch response and tilting.  To my surprise, the game was actually playable on the Valet.  The frame rate was sluggish in brief instances, and the overall display wasn't visually stunning, but the swipes and tilts registered quite effectively.  Considering this is a bare-bones mobile device, it was a bit surprising to see this game perform adequately.The Valet's battery life is typical for Android.  The call quality seemed passable, but the speaker volume is a little on the weak side.  Most of the specs on this phone are running average to below-average compared to other Android devices.  One pleasant surprise was the inclusion of a notification LED.  Even some mid-range phones lack this important feature, but the Valet does have it.  It also accepts MicroSD cards up to 32 GB, in case the 4 GB card (included) does not get the job done.I was also pleasantly surprised by the amount of on-board storage.  Most entry-level prepaid devices don't have nearly enough internal storage capability.  The Valet boasts 4 GB internal, so you should have enough room for all your important apps and even a little extra space for non-essential ones.  Once again, for a sub-$100 Android device, you certainly can't find too many faults here.The biggest downside is the camera which is barely useful for anything but the simplest photos.  There is a flash, but no auto-focus.  The image quality might be okay for MMS messages.  However, anything beyond that purpose is going to be a disappointment.  This is not a huge deal-breaker for me personally since the phone does well in other areas.It is Tracfone's tremendous value which has made the Valet impressive to me.  Not everyone needs a high-end mobile device that costs over $100 per month to operate.  In fact, most people could get by with far less and not suffer any ill consequences.  This is the market segment that is all too often ignored by the big carriers.  If you're someone who has sat on the fence about getting a smartphone because of cost, the Valet has taken away your very last reservation.  Plans can run as little as $7 per month, depending on your usage patterns of course, and are extremely flexible for most basic-to-moderate cell phone users.  As an added bonus, the Valet is powered by Verizon's well-respected CDMA network meaning you won't have to worry much about \"dead zones\" and dropped calls.I couldn't give this phone a five-star rating due to some technical shortcomings, but it has earned a solid four-star review in my estimation.

Yeah, it may not have the bells and whistles or the speed of other smart phones out there, but then again, I pay under $10.00 per month.  So far, the phone is working fine.  I don't plan on using it for streaming music or video--nor do I intend to download all sorts of apps. I just want to be able to use the web, check email and connect to work -- meaning I intend to use the phone for the basics.  Don't know what all the criticism is about the phone unless someone simply got a \"dud.\"  It is what it is and if you want a fancy phone with lots of bells and whistles, then pay $200 a month and get an iPhone. This phone gets the job done for me and is affordable. Also, as I did with my old tracfone, I bought a 1 year card and then I made sure I didn't go over--this is how to maintain the low monthly fee.  Same with this Android--however---I doubt it will be a problem because they triple the units upon purchase at tracfone and I'm not a person who is texting every two minutes or making lots of calls, nor will I be a heavy web user.  One word of warning....having been a tracfone user for years, their customer service system is useless.  They have call centers all over the world, which is fine, but what happens is it takes forever to resolve issues-- 45 min or so while someone puts you on hold while they \"check for information\" then finally they pass you onto someone else and you start all over again.  Thankfully I haven't had to use their service often, but it is very difficult, insanely frustrating to resolve problems.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Detailed Review Of ZTE Valet", "Author": "Ian Thomas", "ReviewID": "R1BV0ZJ1E0VQDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ZTE Valet from Tracfone is one of the first android phones to be offered on their network, making it a great choice for first time smart phone owners. It also runs on a fairly new android OS, android 4.1 jelly bean. This review will cover the Service, User Epxerience, Functionality, and Value.Functionality:This ZTE Valet, as I mentioned, runs on android 4.1, making fairly up to date in the smart phone world. I have tested the phone and It is compatible with almost all apps available on the Google Play store. It also has Wi Fi and 3G data, allowing you to access the internet at home or while traveling. The Wi Fi feature also allows you to save on data usage when it is not necessary. The phone makes switching between Wi Fi and 3G easy with a widget allowing you to turn on and off Wi Fi and 3G data with just a tap. The phone also allows you to access your e-mail account via Gmail or the secondary mail app. The phone has a 3 Megapixel camera with flash and has the ability to use digital zoom, and has video capabilities. It takes mediocre pictures and the shutter time is fairly responsive. The video quality is also just OK, but not the worst I have the seen in a phone. The Google maps navigation works very well and is great when you need directions quickly.User Experience:After having the phone for about a month, It has proven to be a fast and responsive phone most of the time. The only time you will experience lag, is after closing out of a graphically intensive application or game. It handles web browsing, video streaming, and phone calls excellently. The 3G data speeds are great for web browsing and social media, but they can be a little slow when attempting to stream video.Service:The Valet and all other android phones on Tracfone run off the Verizon network, unlike the feature phones which run off the AT&T; network. This means that your coverage may vary. Check the Verizon website to make sure your area has coverage.Value:This phone provides a lot great new features for long time Tracfone users or new smart phone owners. The pay as you go service also gives users much more flexibility than standard monthly plans. At $60 (During the time of this review) I would recommend the ZTE Valet to anyone who needs or wants a smart phone without the long contracts or expensive monthly fees.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great phone for almost any use.", "Author": "Dennis G.

Verizon towers, Android, large enough without being a mini-tablet.  Have now owned it and used it enough to have formed an opinion on the phone.  It is my first ZTE, and over all, it is a good basic smart phone with a few issues.Good:- Android- screen size- price- battery life (see below)- no contract service- fairly capableBad:- Camera is a bit sub-par compared to LG and Samsung smart phones- Wireless, BT and Signal indicators radically inaccurate (see below)- Only works best once Snapdragon controller app installed (see below)Thoughts:- first, about battery life.  The phone has good battery life, provided you don't leave Synch, Data, BT, GPS and Wireless on.  I typically turn off Synch, Data and WiFi when I leave the house (I use a BT ear piece and car system, and a couple of apps use GPS) and when I am at home, I turn off BT and GPS.  With that done, the phone can (and has) gone six days on a single charge, with an average of three calls per day of sixteen minutes average duration.  If I leave GPS and WiFi on at home, the phone still gives me a solid 4 days.  However, if you leave all the boards lit, you are realistically looking at about 30 HOURS - max.  More so if you have an app running that is hogging radio usage.- second, signal strength indicators.  The phone has Wifi, BT, Cell and 3G indicators.  I discovered rapidly that they are only vaguely accurate, even after installing the Snapdragon controller app.  First few days, the phone was running bare under T&E; protocol.  It was in a location with a cell signal booster and a commercial-grade wifi unit that gives full signal to all radio devices in the location (laptops, iPhones, Samsung Android phone, tablets, Roku, CDMA and GSM phones of different makes).  The ZTE showed two bars of cell and one bar of wireless.  After loading a signal testing program, I discovered that the signal app detected excellent to good signal everywhere - even in a few places where the phone showed no signal at all.  I have made calls in rooms where the phone shows no cell signal, and I have streamed test video footage over the network in locations where the WiFi shows no signal.  Caveat: both times, if I tried to initiate the call while the indicator said 'no signal' the phone refused to even try.  At first, I just used a signal app (OpenSignal) to refresh all my wireless, but I later installed the Snapdragon app.  Doing that fixed the problem, although if you started a call in a different area, you could walk into the 'no signal' area and the call never dropped, faded or broke up - even when the indicator said 'No Signal'.  The signal app showed average signal in that area, btw.  So, the indicators are at best suspect, if not flat-out wrong.- Next, the Snapdragon app.  I found this app in Play by searching for ZTE Valet app.  The Snapdragon app is basically a CPU manufacturer controller app that runs the Snapdragon CPU in this phone differently than the OEM controller.  And it works surprisingly well.  Battery life, signal, stability, speed - all went up (though not all by the same amount).  Once I installed it and got the baseline established, the signal indicator problem went away by and large.  So did the issue constant -reconnecting to the WiFi AP.  Battery life went up, and the GPS functionality got a lot more stable.  The app also reminds you to charge your phone, and it seems (no proof, just seems like it does) to make the entire phone more responsive, almost as if were clocking the CPU differently or increased the efficiency of the app handling in and out of queue.  Also, I have never had to reboot the phone after the Snapdragon app was installed, though in all honesty, I only had to reboot it once before the app was installed due to hung system error.- Finally, GPS issues.  Not sure what is going on here.  Certain apps I use a lot (OpenSignal, SignalSniff, etc) that usually work flawlessly on smartphones and tablets seem to have issues with the GPS handling in this phone.  I do not use my phone for navigation (my Garmin simply out-performs all phone-based navigation - especially iPhone nav) but it is necessary for certain tasks (Snapdragon app uses it, which is the only reason I leave it on any more).  Not sure if this is a phone issue, an OS issue or a software issue, but it is an issue for me, at least.Final thoughts:This phone is hard to beat in the price range and in no-contract phones.  Great?  Not really.  Good?  Yeah, once you get it set up right.  TracFone's new smartphone airtime policy is a bit of a departure from the old system, but nothing shocking.  As CPUs go, Snapdragon isn't bad, but it isn't a Hummingbird either.  If you keep your expectations realistic and want a work phone rather than a bit of snob-bling, this phone is probably right for you.  I know that if I ever lose my phone like my colleague did, I will just shrug and buy another one, instead of having to sell my car to buy another iProduct status symbol.  It would be nice to have an upgrade path for the OS, but it is hardly necessary.  My work tablet is still running 2.3 and it works perfectly fine, after all.Yeah, I'd buy this phone again.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Jim Moore", "ReviewID": "R2E0U0NMZ6N8UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgraded from LG420 to this phone and I could not be happier.

Before you spend any time with it downloading apps or creating contacts or otherwise customizing it, first make sure once it is activated that the calling features work--that you can actually make a call, receive a call and set up your voice mail. I spend hours setting up my new phone and then realized there was a problem with the phone calling part even though the Tracfone website showed it was activated.  And if you have a problem like I did, they will likely ask you at some point to reset the phone which will wipe out things like any downloaded apps and contacts you have created.I spent a total of about 3 hours over two days talking to several Tracfone reps as they moved me up their tiered customer service.  They had me try numerous activation numbers, none of which worked.  They also had me remove the battery and reset the phone numerous times.  Finally, the last Tracfone rep after more than an hour talking to him apparently contacted Verizon wireless and they did some kind of system update and it finally worked.So I am now looking at spending a couple of hours or so downloading all my apps again.  Otherwise, while this is my first smartphone, it seems to work pretty well.  I plan to use apps mostly with Wi-Fi so I can keep my cost around $7/month.  Cheapest deal I found.  And the triple minutes are nice.  And with a google account, it syncs with your emails and you get your pics too.  What I like too is that you can download grocery coupons and deals like at Safeway (the Just for U program) and Fry's (Kroger) at home on your desktop and then take your phone with you to see your shopping list at the stores without using your minutes because these two chains now have Wi-Fi.

The phone starts up with minimal delay and automatically goes through the process to set up/login to a Google Play account.  The touchscreen is responsive and any delay between screens/apps is minimal.Since my previous TracFone was on T-Mobile's network, I had to wait about 24 hours for TracFone to port my number over to Verizon before I could really start using the phone.  I had read elsewhere that a new airtime card was needed so the phone could be activated, so I bought a 60 minute card not knowing that transferring a number and airtime from another phone would fulfill that requirement.After I got the phone activated, I still had the 60 minute airtime card I didn't really need for activation.  Since airtime cards are non-refundable, I redeemed my airtime card and ran into a problem.  You can't enter the card PIN directly into the phone like most TracFones to redeem a card (not very convenient IMHO).  I went to TracFone's website and redeemed it there.  I got a confirmation text message stating a card was redeemed, but no airtime was credited to my phone. (TracFone doesn't have an airtime display on their smartphones and you need to request a text message via their website to find out how many minutes, texts, and web browsing MBs you have left.)  It took a chat session and 2 calls to TracFone to get my minutes added.  My impression was TracFone was having computer problems at the time, as the customer service reps had problems looking up information while on the phone with me.  They were pleasant though and eventually got the issue resolved.Overall, if you want to try a smartphone just for calls, a few apps, and general web browsing, the ZTE Valet will work fine.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "I've bought 3 so far, no complaints", "Author": "Gary W. \"GaryW\"", "ReviewID": "R3KUM247RYVNON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Breaking the \"contract\" phone cycle I put my 2 sons on these based upon usage, one for $99 per year, the other at $199 per year at a huge savings.

I started with the 1200 minutes/texts/mb plan with a year of service so it won't expire too soon, and that was a good choice for me since I don't make calls often, and only use data for quick checks when I'm not on wifi.The phone is awful though. Google Maps crashes all the time and I can't use it. Browsing the web reminds me of the days of dialup, and it's purely because this phone can't handle it since I have very fast wifi at home. It works okay for calls, though when I switched, many people told me my call quality had dropped and they had a harder time hearing me. Both the cell signal and wifi signal are significantly reduced compared to other phones being used in the same place. I restart the phone before expecting to surf the web to at least start out fresh, but that just brings it from 'barely usable' to 'mediocre'.The camera is a piece of junk. Image quality is awful compared to any other phone I've used. The tint is always off, the images are grainy, and they never seem to focus well. Forget being able to snap a pic of something up close to research later, as any picture closer than 5ft has never came out in focus. This may be acceptable for instagram, but for anything else it's way sub-par.The only good thing about the phone is battery life. I mostly left it alone and once got 6 days on standby before it got to 10% battery. With my typical use, I get about 2 days. You really only get about 3 hours of heavy use, so if you are playing a game, surfing the web, responding to emails, etc. it will die pretty quickly, and this mostly seems to be due to having the screen on. I bought a spare battery for a few bucks which works great too, as a backup for traveling away from outlets.The trick I've found to making the most of Tracfone is to route your number through Google Voice. Since I take most of my calls at home by a computer anyway, I can just answer the calls on Google and not use any minutes. Texts sent via Google Voice are free also, but you pay for the ones received. Wifi is the key to limiting data use too, and I leave data off unless I am actively using it. This has meant that I can get by on about 2000 minutes per year which means I pay at most $200/yr for service.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great way of getting a smartphone without the cost", "Author": "M.

After comparing specifications and reading a bunch of reviews I decided to go with the ZTE Valet and the family couldn't be happier.  I didn't purchase the phones here. I ended up getting them for $49.99 from Target and Best Buy.  We have only had the phones for 10 days, but no one has any complaints, so far.All the bad reviews relating to WIFI had me scared and was the biggest concern to not get this particular phone.  That fear has quickly gone away.  We get great reception through our Netgear router.  The reception is no better or worse than any of our other wireless products.  My biggest concern now is how long will the phone last.  Time will tell and I will adjust this review accordingly.Upgrading the phones through Tracfone was quick and easy.

I bought it and as soon as I charged it I was able to switch my existing tracfone phone number to this one. (See below for important catch).  I had to spend some time getting acquainted with all the features, and was able to set up my email accounts easily without all that log in data that usually takes some knowledge (of which I have none).  Lots of regular features, plus Bluetooth.  Data is easy, but reading from the net is small and awkward.It can be used in portrait and landscape position, just be turning the phone.  Easy to set alarms and also a bedtime clock that is faint but helpful at night.  Standard camera and video.Here's the big issue to watch out for:  when I transferred my phone number (which was super easy) it deleted the minutes I had left on my tracfone.  I thought both would transfer. TF was then a royal pain in the behind at this point, saying I had no minutes left, and my old phone became \"unregistered\" when I sent the new number over so I lost almost 200 minutes.  I was ticked and TF says there was no way to determine how many minutes were lost. (Really? Their computers can't tell? I didn't believe them) SO, my advice is to have your old phone (if you are using one in the first place) and CALL tracfone and have them activate manually.  Make them confirm your minutes and data left before you do anything.  Have both phones in hand when you call.Another warning: when you set up email, it transfers all your email contacts as well. I hated this as I have thousands of contacts and I'm not sure how to weed them out now.  So check first to see if that's an option you can avoid.  OR, set up a new gmail or yahoo account first on your PC and then use that for your phone email, if anything to make it less messy.I hope you find this helpful.

Battery life may be low if used for both GPS and Data (radio management is important for good battery life between charges).  The camera flash is not worth using.  Photos are slightly dim.  The camera will not focus close enough for UPC and bar codes (my only significant disappointment).  The camera access button on the lower-right side of the phone is easy to inadvertently press.  The phone case back is hard to pry off and feels somewhat fragile.  After the initial round of Android updates Text-to-Speech stopped working  (but was restored after undoing the TTS update - this seems to be a known problem with other Andriod devices.).Don\u2019t expect an iPhone in terms of screen quality or speed.  But as a $60 no-contract Andriod 4.1 smart-phone with low monthly costs the Tracfone ZTE Valet is O.K.Sadly, interaction with Tracfone due to unexpected phone startup issues may require lots of patience \u2013 it took me six days, at least that many hours, and many land-line calls to get my number and minutes ported from my old Tracfone to the Valet.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pretty impressed...", "Author": "Toni Warren", "ReviewID": "R10WAB7VBLXML8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had to downsize from my Samsung S III, I was expecting the worst.

I had to jump through so many damn hoops after that, I thought it was a goner. Let me say that I was not born yesterday when it comes to electronics, as a matter of fact I love them and the more buttons the better. But when I had some issue I can't remember, I thought a reset would do the trick. I don't really read manuals and figure I would just learn by experience as usual. I thought it would be like resetting any device. But after that I tried calling but no success. It wouldn't send or receive calls, which was not a problem beforehand. If you have already done a format reset, well blessings to you and keep trying if you have the patience. I must have called them over two dozen times.I'm not sure exactly when or how long this was (beginning of January and at least over a week) but it was the most awful customer service experience ever. Some of the people seemed to have an attitude as soon as I called, while most seemed pretty unfamiliar with my problem. When I first began calling, I thought I totally messed up since everyone acted like I couldn't be helped because I \"wasn't in the service area,\" which seemed like bollocks because according to the website when I put in my zip I was covered--turned out my specific address missed the coverage by just a tad, I checked coverage myself on Verizon the site and they agreed themselves after they actually checked it. I also searched through various forums to see if I was the only one, and according to my research it seems that a lot of android phones have this issue. But I didn't know that at the time.I followed all their directions, every single one I was given, even when it didn't make sense, even when I had already done them, over and over again. It was the most infuriating process. Half of the calls were long (over 50 minutes) and so many didn't want to listen to me. Online I saw some people had same the same mistake I did and said after trying so long they eventually updated it or something. Anyway that gave me hope, so I kept trying. Since I missed the coverage mark by a hair, however, they just didn't even want to consider doing the update, so after talking to one lady who suggested I drive somewhere with coverage, that's what I did. Then I call again to talk to some other flunk who yet again sounded so rude and ticked off just knowing she was going to get a caller. This messed continued for another 45 minutes until she asked me was I in the same zip code I activated the phone on. I said no--everyone that I spoke to said it didn't matter where, just be in the service area, and since I had to go to that town anyway, I chose that spot. SO after saying curse word that came to mind, I drove back to my own street, but an area that had coverage, and FINALLY after the same stuff (activation codes, turning it on and off, taking out the battery) she finally moved on and tried something else. Even she tried to get me to reset it again and I was like, lady no--I just did that with another rep, it's not going to do anything. She was the first and only one to say ok and move on. I know people need to follow a certain criteria with these things, but after its been done 50,000 times, 50,001 will not work.To wrap up this mess (didn't realize how much I typed but people need to know this,) she got me back on track. Don't know what she was doing but she was obviously talking to someone else and following their instructions. I started dialing local numbers to see if they would go through, and eventually they did. It was miraculous. Then she got me to have someone call me (check if I could receive calls) and it was legit. Finally it was over. This experience represents why I hate customer and technical support.-----BACK TO THE PHONE:I like the phone very much, although I do miss real buttons. Sometimes it does freeze up a bit but not much. The camera takes the best pictures when it has good lighting, The flash doesn't do much.There are some things I don't have much of an opinion on, like the gps, camera, etc, because I already have my own. I do like that it came with an sd card, and the wifi for me has done just fine, however I only use that in the house. Whenever I go out I just switch to data. Its nice to have something with internet on it, though I wouldn't recommend it for prolonged surfing. Switching my number and minutes was easy. It does what a phone is suppose to, making calls and such.I did notice some eye strain. Don't know what kind of screen it has but I've heard complaints of LED screens causing eye strain, and not after long use, maybe 20-30 minutes tops. Now I make it a point to blink more often and turn away sometimes when I'm playing game apps.Again I'm a first timer and I think it's fine. Just be aware if you NEED to reset it. It was worth the $75 then spend on it.

Young", "ReviewID": "R15VSDGUKZXRT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've had this phone for over three weeks. There seems to be plenty of people that are rating Tracfone, instead of this particular model. Yes, we've had a few issues with Tracfone. One being some idiot who got our serial number incorrect when making the transfer from an old phone to a new one. You'd think it would have been just a few mixed up numbers of the phone's serial... nope, the guy had a completely incorrect serial number and gave my wife's number to someone else who did not want it either, lol. That took an hour and a half... of my minutes... which makes me mad...My other gripe of Tracfone is this, and yes it is relevant. They did not transfer over all of our minutes to the new phone. I was mad, and I gave them a piece of my mind, but no cigar in the end. My wife had 2100 minutes on her old triple minutes phone and should have received 2100 call, 2100 mbs data and 2100 texts on the Valet. Nope... just 2100 minutes and 100 text and 100 mbs data. They gave us some spiel about how it's got the new way of splitting up minutes into three categories. All of this is irrelevant, because if I were to right now go buy enough minutes to triple to 2100, it would break up into three categories of 2100... Just to be aware if you are transferring minutes from one phone to this phone (reading these reviews, it seems we were the only ones who got the shaft). I am still contemplating a BBB complaint... might go there.The phone itself works great. Only gripe so far is that it seems sluggish sometimes. An example of that would be unlocking the phone. It lags and isn't very smooth. There are some other moments it seems to be sluggish, but that doesn't bother me. Plays aps well enough and does what it does pretty well. In my area, Verizon is the only suitable service, as the others do NOT get any good service. This phone always seems to work, even if the bars are low. But we are at the end of nowhere, small tip of a peninsula in Maryland.Ringtones work great and it works great with the pc. I had songs from zedge downloaded and put on the phone in mere minutes. So nice to finally have a tracfone that lets you put on custom content!Wifi works well for us, in all our house, but our house is small to be honest. However, it is a brick house (no, don't sing that song), and I get decent reception, even out of the house a few yards or so.If you're going Tracfone, you're looking to save money. Sure, other phones are going to be better here or there. Honestly, it works great and does what it says it does. Plenty of features and plenty of options for skins and other gear for it.So in conclusion, phone good, Verizon service (for our area: good), Tracfone customer service: bad.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stay Away", "Author": "VINCE", "ReviewID": "R3BH1MXQRJP8RX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Doesn't work so well.

Unfortunately the experience dealing with tracfone to port my old number from Straight Talk (owned by Tracfone) was horrible. It took over a week and I probably had to talk to 10 plus representative to get it right. Granted the initial mistake was mine in activation. Be sure you have an airtime card before starting. My issue is trying to fix what was my initial error was a journey that was in my mind unnecessary if customer service was better. I give 4 stars because at the end of the day I have a great phone for price, the phone number I need, the service I need, all for less than $8 per month. Also in fairness I and my family have been customers with Tracfone or one of their subsidiaries (Straight Talk and NET 10) and this is the only time I have had to exert unreasonable effort to obtain the savings.

Funny timing: mere weeks after I switched, they spontaneously joined the fray with 4 Android phones that all hit the market around last October (all featuring low-end hardware and 3G, but also low prices).  Still being a minimalist who places high priority on rock-bottom bills, I decided to jump back in.I decided on the ZTE by way of elimination.  From what I've read, the other 3 phones are all deal-breakingly bad:-The LG Optimus Dynamic ($80) is an anachronism with an ancient version of Android (2.3 Gingerbread) and a small 3.2\" screen.  Worse, it only has ~150 MB of internal memory, so it can only fit like 4 apps before the phone's full.-The Samsung Galaxy Centura ($130) has decent specs (Android Ice Cream Sandwich, 1 GHz processor, more memory) but everyone says it's prone to randomly crashing, freezing, and forgetting what time it is.  Having recently owned a Samsung that did the same stuff, I believe it.-The Huawei Glory ($100), which sucks because it's a Huawei, no further explanation needed, though there are plenty on Amazon.On paper, this ZTE matches/beats the others on all counts: it has one of the freshest version of Android (4.1 Jelly Bean), a 1 GHz processor, 4 GB of internal storage, 3 MP camera with flash (and is the only one that lets you turn off the shutter sound), 3.5\" screen, not too much bloatware, and a competitive price of $100.  But it has a couple flaws of its own, just not the kind that show up on paper:-The touch screen kind of sucks -- it's spontaneously sensitive, sometimes registering your button presses and sometimes ignoring you.-The Wi-Fi is an abomination -- unless you're in the exact same room as your router, it probably won't work.  My bedroom is one room away from where the router sits, yet this phone is blind to it 80% of the time.  Every other Wi-Fi device used in this house can get reception at the end of the driveway and beyond.  Since you pay for every megabyte of data, a flaw like this kind of defeats the point of going with TracFone in the first place.In theory, TracFone's still the best deal in town for super-light users.  Example: if every 3 months you buy one of their \"120-minute\" (actually 360) cards for $30 + a 2 GB pure data card for $50, then every month you'll be paying $27 for 120 minutes of talk time, 120 texts, and 787 MB of data -- not too stifling.The good news is that the LG Optimus Dynamic 2 is supposedly right around the corner, which supposedly solves the problems of the first version (more memory, faster processor, bigger screen) and so has a chance of becoming TracFone's first good smartphone.

The wifi reception has never been great, but recently started to fail altogether. I called Tracfone to have them replace the phone, since it's under warranty for a year. They refused to replace it (I talked to three agents, escalating until I could escalate no more). They will only replace a phone if it can't make or receive calls, but other features of the phone (camera, wifi, etc.) may break and they won't act in these cases. The warranty doesn't make any exceptions, but Tracfone knows that they can get away with this, that one little customer isn't going to be able to sue them or prosecute. So, this is my small way of saying \"buyer beware.\" Once I use up my minutes (just bought 1000), I'm done with Tracfone. I can't support a company that won't keep their word, that won't abide by their own warranty.If you do stick with Tracfone, buy a better used phone with better features than this one.

I get the same amount of wifi as my wife does with her tablet at the same distance.  Which is 3 bars at 30 feet away. I used to leave my phone on for 4 days straight and when I go turn the power on the screen won't come on, but the touch sensitive buttons will light up.  I have to take the battery out and put it back in and it'll be fine. So now I turn my phone off every other day and now my phone does not do that.  The speaker phone isn't that great but I think lower end phones don't have good volume for the speaker phone part.  This phone has three (3) seperate tanks for talk, text and data.  For example: you buy a 60 minute card you get 180 talk minutes, 180 texts, and 180MB of data with the triple minute benefit.  Which means if you text it will not use your data and your talk minutes. The only time data is used during text is when you have to retrieve a multi media message because data has to be turned on to retrieve the picture.  Which it does not use much. Everytime you add an airtime card all the three (3)seperate tanks carry over.  (It will be added to your previous balance). You can download the Tracfone app to keep track of your balance. You don't have to press as hard on the screen like some of the older touch screen Tracfones like LG 800g.  I got this phone so I could pay my bills using the apps because I have paperless billing.  You can add or remove home screens to your liking.  I think you can add up to 9 home screens.  I downloaded Clean Master which now has it's own security, anti virus.  That helps keep my phone running smooth.  I was looking for a phone with a flash for the camera and I found one.  The object has to be kinda close in low light conditions for the flash to pick up an object that your taking a picture of, but it works excellent in good lighting conditions like outdoors.  This phone has a led indicator to notify you if you have a missed call or have gotten a text message, which blinks red when you have no service, and when the battery is low.  It blinks green when you get a text message or missed call, and orange for when it's on charge.  The sensors on the top left beside the ear piece turns off and on the touch sensitive buttons automatically, depending on the ambient lighting.  The sensor also turns off the screen when you make a phone call and you have the phone up to your ear, and turns the screen on when you move the phone away from your ear.  I like the side camera button too.  It makes taking pictures and videos easier without touching your screen.  This is not a bad phone for the price if you know what you are doing.  It is everything that I want in a cell phone.  It takes pictures and videos, it's an mp3 player (you can use up to 32G micro sd card), you can multi task, (you can browse the web while you are talking on the phone), pay bills using the apps, I can use the Xbox Smartglass to control my Xbox 360.  If you are a newbie to android phones like me then this is the phone to get that's affordable.  I think it does what the more expensive phones do.  The only thing I don't like is that I you can't delete any of the apps that you don't use that came with the phone.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not worth the aggravation of dealing with tracfone and very poor wifi reception!", "Author": "kdm", "ReviewID": "R2AHP1O2P66QDE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I love the phone with the exception that the wall charger stopped working the first day and the WIFI reception is incredibly poor!

I'm hoping I just got a lemon, but this phone is horrible, when used as a phone.  If using it to play games or surf the internet, it usually works, although it's a bit slow, and sometimes I have to restart the phone because the touch screen quits working.But my biggest concern is using it as a phone.  First, if you call someone, it doesn't always let you hang up.  Quite often, after you pull it away from your head to hang up, the screen flashes to the hang up screen, but before you can touch the \"disconnect\", it goes black, and you can't hang up.  I've tried sweeping the screen, pressing home, and even pressing the power button, but nothing works, and I've had to take out the battery to hang up.  YOU SHOULDN\"T HAVE TO TAKE OUT THE BATTERY TO HANG UP!!Second, the phone doesn't seem to always recognize that you have your phone next to your face, so if you're dialing something that requires you to use the touch pad, like a bank or something, you have to select the touch pad, and then select the option to put it away again before you put the phone against your face, or else your cheek will be randomly hitting buttons.  I have also had my phone randomly generating a text message, or pulling up a miscellaneous app, or doing other things while I am in the middle of a phone call.Third, the phone doesn't always allow you to answer it when it rings... which can be a problem.  It again blacks out, or goes to another screen, all the while, you are frantically trying to find the screen that will allow you to answer your phone.Fourth, I tried taking a call on call waiting, but it disconnected the first call in order to do so... so that doesn't work either.So, as a phone, this is a dismal failure.  Besides that, there are all kinds of little piddly things about this phone I really hate.  I will NEVER get this phone again.

My husband had an old basic Tracfone with a lot of minutes, so we thought this would make sense as a transition plan.Transferring all the minutes from the old phone to the new phone was a bit of a hassle. We couldn't do it online, but had to call customer service. We finally succeeded after about 30 minutes on the phone. The person on the phone had a very strong accent (but was pleasant and willing to repeat his instructions).Initially, I was fairly happy with the ZTE Valet. I haven't made any calls on it (still weaning myself from that old basic phone) but texting and apps work well. The screen is responsive (I bought the SuperShieldz HD Clear Screen Protectors, and they're pretty good). I don't intend to play any games requiring web access, and my apps tend to require limited data (weather, flight tracking), so the modest processor doesn't bother me. The battery life is quite good when the phone is on standbyWhat knocks the Valet from a 4-star phone to a 3-star phone is the Wi-Fi connectivity. It works well at my house, where we have a strong signal. It has worked on strong public Wi-Fi. Once I'm at work (a major research university) I cannot get a connection. I've tried it in several buildings, and it cannot use the signal. I had intended to rely on the Wi-Fi network while at work, but that's not possible with this phone. The university's Wi-Fi signal isn't bad--I can connect well using other devices--but this phone apparently needs a very strong signal to use Wi-Fi.If you need a basic smartphone and plan to primarily use the cell network, the Valet is a good option. If you plan to use Wi-Fi, make sure you have a very strong signal where you plan to use it.

Miller", "ReviewID": "R3SMQQN1I6UK1T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I delayed writing this for around four months so I could live with the phone and give an honest opinion. Let's start by stating the obvious. The phone is about 3-4 years behind the current technology. Having made that observation, you will begin to grasp why you would want something that is by modern standards under-powered and outclassed. The phone is cheap, as is the cost to operate on Tracfone's service. If you are used to the most up-to-date devices and have a need for unlimited service then you may want to look elsewhere. However, if you're fine with a a device that chugs along and will still handle all of the same tasks without the blazing speed, and use your phone in a conservative fashion than look no further.PROS::Excellent value, I paid $80 for the phone and a 200min card that gets tripled, and then split into separate pools.Sturdy, I've dropped it several times and it has yet to show any signs.Up to date, Android 4.1 means that you aren't buying something that can't support newer applications which all require 4.0+Good call quality and service, this is a CDMA device so it uses Verizon and Sprint's network and I always have good reception.Good internal memory (1.5GB+ usable) and a microSD slot.Good battery life, results will vary since I keep data and wifi off when not needed, for me it can last several days of lite usage.CONS:Poor camera quality, probably the weakest point of the phone, will work in a pinch but don't lean on it.Sluggish performance and occasionally apps will crash, this is the runner up for worst feature but manageable by clearing apps from memory when not in use.No root option yet.There are a few smaller gripes but nothing large enough to put on a list. If you're already someone who Tracfone works for than this is a no-brainer and the value of the phone is just as good as the value of the service. I'd love something with a little more screen real estate and a little more processing power so I'll probably upgrade when they release something newer, but for what it's worth this is a great budget smartphone and I'd happily buy it again.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Returned it.", "Author": "James P.

The camera works OK and it does have a flash that works, I wouldn't try to take wedding photos but if you want to take a quick picture of something it does the trick. And it also has Wifi. So kudos to Tracfone for finally offering something besides flip phones. And don't forget you get triple minutes for life! One caveat with the minutes is that they split the minutes between talk, text and data. If you get a 200 min card you get 600 min of talk, 600 texts and 600mb of data. The problem with that is that if like me you talk a lot on the phone you end up with lots of text and data and run out of talk minutes.

I used this phone for almost a month and was impressed with the smooth functioning of the touch screen and ease of adding apps, ect. Where this phone lost 2 stars for me, and what eventually made it a deal breaker and made me return it was mainly two things. Tracfone has made its reputation on the ease with which you can keep track of the minutes and service days you use, which is very important to me. With this new system, they have not yet ironed out the app that allows you to do this from the phone screen, which negates the main reason I carry a tracfone. It seemed like I was losing some min and txt time every few days and I have no  idea how or why, (I had the data mode disabled and only made calls using google voice while on wifi, so I don't know how this was possible.Second, the wifi connection, as reported by others, is very weak and barely reaches 15-18 ft from our wireless router in our small, (1400 sq ft), home. I think  once these type of smartphones have been on the tracfone brand for a while longer and these issues are ironed out, we may try another one sometime down the line.

Definetly not the best phone out there though.", "Author": "M. Baumgartner \"MarcusIan\"", "ReviewID": "R3M6GBNIALDBQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would say the biggest complaint about this phone, is tracphone's change in minutes/balance plan for android devices.  This is not the phone's fault, but is something that tracphone really needs to do something about.  No longer does your combined balance affect text/minutes/data.  instead, each balance is independent.  Even though you may get 600min/600texts/600mbdata from a single 200min card,  you burn through texts (most people at any rate) at double/triple/4-5x the rate of minutes or data....  and guess what, there is NO 'text only' card to buy.  You can buy minutes (which add to all three), or data (which adds data), but all those thousands of minutes are unused - ie. wasted money.  Frankly, we've had a tracfone for a decade, and this, if not fixed, will mean we might as well switch services.That said, this is a review of the phone.  It works, is not too slow, (works great for most apps, even many games without flaw), and with the exception of an odd habit of turning itself off (such that you have to remove the battery to turn it back on) occasionally, is perfectly functional as an android device.  For the money, the phone is excellent.  Unfortunately, the service no longer is excellent.  There are some features that could be improved upon.  I love the swype keyboard on my other phone - which this does not support, and the camera is somewhat sad in this day and age -abhorrent in low light, and only crappy in good light.  The screen is not what I would call 'gorgeous', more like 'functional'. But the battery life is quite good (better than my other phone).All in all, this is a prepaid phone, and vastly better than the LG840 it replaced.

I also like Tracfone because their prices and coverage are very hard to beat (don't get me started about their service). I have a computer background and always wanted a smartphone, but couldn't justify the cost of an IPhone and a long contract. When prepaid Androids started becoming available a few years ago, I tried several different Androids from several different carriers, but have always ended up with a bad phone, bad coverage, or have paid for minutes I didn't use. I was one of those people waiting for Tracfone to offer Androids.Last fall, when Tracfone moved in that direction, I checked over the specs and reviews for the 3 Androids they offered, and decided on the Valet. What a mistake! The first phone they sent me froze up and could not be activated, so I had to wait 2 weeks for a replacement. The replacement phone is extremely slow and buggy, and freezes up regularly. It regularly launches apps or turns on the camera or the calculator in the middle of a phone call. The touch screen is unresponsive, and sometimes has to be punched repeatedly to make things work. I get 1 or 2 bars on my home wifi when I am 20-25 feet from the router.

The camera on the phone is not great and it lacks a critical autofocus feature.  Without the autofocus, you cannot focus on close items, such as bar codes or QR codes. So forget about using useful apps to look up prices, etc.2.  The sensors are limited.  For example, it has not magnetic field sensors, so you cannot use the phone with compass apps or other apps that need geospatial data (like Google Sky to see the stars will not work without the magnetic field sensors).3.  This is a generic Android phone, so when it boot up , you will not see any Tracfone logos or menus on the phone.  You will need to download Tracfone's app from the Google Play! store to track your balances (use the widget and get free text updates whenever you ask).As a basic phone it is OK...I am glad to have the ability to use it to access my Google schedule, check email, etc.Some notes about Tracfone airtime cards and transferring your phone number...1.  It is easy to transfer your Tracfone phone number from one phone to the next...you can do it on line from your Tracfone account, or you can call Tracfone and they will assist.  Be sure to write down your minutes balance and service end date before you start just in case something goes wrong.2.  I purchased a Tracfone 400 minute airtime card bundled with this new smart phone (the phone has triple minutes for life, so value was 1200 minutes).  Unfortunately the Amazon vendor sent me an airtime card for a normal phone, instead of the new air cards fro a smart phone.  I had to call Tracphone to find out why my minutes didn't triple (and it took three different mangers and 2 hours on the phone for them to explain that they had set up a new type of card for smart phones).3.  What really annoyed me is that they would honor the 250 bonus minutes I would have received with my old cell phone.  The new smart phone airtime cards do not include any bonus minutes (read the very small print cleverly hidden on Tracfone's web site).  SUGGESTION:  To get around this, first load the new airtime card and bonus minutes on your old Tracphone, then transfer the number an minutes over to your new smart Tracfone.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Onboard Sensor not working", "Author": "WOTNWABBIT", "ReviewID": "R31U4SR77BA218", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update and correction:This is my first android phone, so please excuse my ignorance in some terminology about the sensors.

On my phone all of them are reported working except the Magnetic Field Sensor.Prior to installing the app, I had called ZTE support.  That word needs quotation marks.  The tech was even more ignorant about the sensors than I.  To blow me off he told me there was no magnetic field sensor on the phone.Compass, Astronomy, and other apps relying on this sensor will not work on my phone YMMV.Also, like many others I'm finding the phone weak on Cell and Wifi reception.Update 2:  After using this phone for a few months, I wish I could give it more stars.

I wanted to be able to access/view my home security cameras remotely - occasionally -while having the compactness and simplicity of a regular non-contract phone.  I have relatively large hands and my Google password is 24 characters long. The user interface keyboard(i.e. clicking on the tiny default factory supplied keyboard on screen) was so error prone/unreliable as an interface that I literally had to shorten my Google password just to get this thing to authenticate reliably to Google.  Eventually I downloaded a Big Keyboard type application from Google Play.  I find nothing is intuitive about this phone.  Erasing your call history, erasing certain contacts.  I just don't like the layout of this.  The display is decent quality considering the phone is only $79.00.  The camera is forgettable/mediocre quality.  One positive I will tell you:  While everyone bashes Tracfone's support I have found them to be quite responsive.  Unlike 5 years ago, Tracfone actually seems to care about getting you help these says.  I commend them for that.  I can find them, I can get a response from them, they take action.  By the way from what Tracfone told me, one minute of purchased phone card time is 1MB of data and it is not doubled or tripled.I have asked to have my phone number reverted back to my old skool non-smartphone with real buttons, regular firmware and will use that for everyday phone calls.  I will then get this phone a separate phone number and experiment with it at my leisure so as not to be aggravated.  In the meantime I will look to Apple or even Windows for a smart phone OS.  I value my privacy, do not live on Facebook and, while I use gmail, am not comfortable with all the merged Gmail accounts and being - more or less - forced to store my password on the cell phone.  I think this phone could work for those persons who have the time and inclination to fuss with it, wade through a bunch of menu preferences, and don't mind figuring out the shades of contact sharing security and Google's security in general.  If you don't mind being tethered to Google in myriad and sundry ways this phone will work fine for you.  I think some people will love this phone, especially at it's price of entry for a no-contract phone.  It's just not for me.REVISED REVIEW:  Well I kept this thing and got my contacts setup on it.  I can say that it has better phone talk audio quality than my old LG500 phone (it wouldn't take much to surpass that).  I eventually got my contacts into it.  You can surf with it but with the screen size you'd be kind of desparate.  I downloaded the Citrix Receiver app (Citrix is a \"screen scraping\" way of delivering commercial applications) and it worked although the screen was so small, even with pinch-to-zoom and changing resolutions, other tricks that that was a novelty.  I may still get this phone working for my original purpose.  At the very least it looks like I will keep it as \"a phone\".  The thing that bugs me the most is getting some menus or menu items to respond when the skin on my finger tips is drier - which is a lot as I type alot.  I also have larger fingers/fingertips.  I find I have to sometimes pound/tap on certain displayed options to get them to respond.  I just depends on the day or even time of day.  My old phone went 10 days without a recharge.  This phone, with Bluetooth and extras turned off might go 3 days.  I'm keeping it because I am not in the mood right now to shop for another phone.  It will \"do\" as a phone for now.UPDATE  5/17/2014:If you have large hands and need to call 911 (this happened to me recently) this phone can be frustrating.  The \"haptics\" / screen response varies depending on the moisture in your skin at a particular moment.  You have to be PRE-CISE.  I downloaded the big buttons app but it did not help.Worse however:  The microphone has poor gain compared to other phones I have owned.  The speaker for your ear is fine, but the mic or mic+gain circuit leaves a lot to be desired.The pros:  Yes you can surf on it after a fashion.  Triple minutes and the lack of a contract requirement are a good thing.  The phone can be encrypted.  I will probably upgrade to a slightly larger phone with more responsive screen next year.  For now I will get by with this.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone but crap company that dictates how you use your minutes.", "Author": "MinxFan", "ReviewID": "R1W8P1SINH3LX6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my son who wanted a phone that most looked like an iphone.

Please share this. If you are a Tracfone user and are thinking of switching to their Android phones...DON'T. We purchased this Android Tracfone for my daughter at Christmas thinking it would be nice for her to have the extra capabilities next year on campus. Triple minutes...sounds great too. On her previous phone a 120 minute card tripled was 360 minutes. A text was 1/3 of a minute so she got 1080 texts. On the new Android phones you get 120 phone minutes, 120 texts, and 120 data minutes. Since my daughter usually texts she was out of texts and had added enough air time to have over 1000 talk minutes built up. We decided to transfer her back to her old phone figuring she could at least use those minutes up before getting a different service. They transferred her number, but the Android phone contract does not allow for transfer of minutes. No service rep (and I talked to too many in the transfer process)mentioned that, and the first rep actually said they WOULD transfer. Her new phone from a different carrier arrives today. They have lost one customer from this family and once my minutes are gone I will be considering new carriers as well. BAD move Tracfone. She used this phone for less than 3 months and pumped 5 $30 cards into it without my knowledge before we realized what was going on. One $30 card would normally carry her for that long on her old phone.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Texters beware... This will divide your minutes & can cost more.....", "Author": "J. K. Petre \"Travel222much\"", "ReviewID": "R2RMO1C570PAFR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Almost bought this for my sister until we realized the way they divide the minutes.  Sure, you get triple the minutes, but it's divided into 3 categories:  talk, text & data.  If you buy 400 minutes, you get 1200 talk, 1200 text & 1200 data (I corrected some incorrect math from a previous review.  Thank you SO much to everyone who is quick to correct!).  On top of that, texts will cost you 1 full minute per incoming & outgoing text.On the ancient flip phone she had, she would get double minutes & could use them any way she wanted.  A text would cost .3 minutes.  Using this phone, a text would cost 1 full minute & she would only have the 1200 minutes to use.  Once that's depleted, you can't send/receive texts - even though you have a balance in your talk or data minutes.So, with the old phone, she can send/receive a total of 2400 texts buying 400 minutes.  With this phone, only 1200 total.  That's 50% fewer texts!  Then, you bank up a bunch of minutes you may never use if your primary use is texting.  If you want your minutes partitioned out this way & want to try an Android phone, it could be worth it.  But - if you're looking for an updated phone that will bill you the same way as the old flip phone, this isn't it.  She ended up getting the lower end LG phone which still bills the same & is happier with that.

It's a total turkey. After turning it on I was able to get it to connect to the wifi in my home but it took a few tries because the on screen kbd keys are so small it was hard to enter the WPA key without making mistakes. My first inclination was so far so good. But then I tried to connect it to my PC to move over contacts from my old phone (an LG800) and that's where I ran into problems doing something that should be a no brainer.When I connect my LG to my PC with the usb to mini usb cable the PC (running win XP) recognizes the SD drive right off the bat. When I did the same with the ZTE Valet it wanted me to install some drivers. OK, so I install the drivers. 2 drives show up in Windows Explorer. The first is a tiny 12MB partition that has the driver install on it. When I go to click on the 2nd windows says \"please insert a disc\". For some reason the ZTE supplied driver is looking to windows like a CD-ROM. Not good. Restarting the machine yields no better results.Next I try going in to the settings on the Android phone and changing the PC connection settings so it won't automatically install the driver. Options are to make it look like a media device or a camera. Either way the SD card won't show up as a drive and the system wants a media application I don't have and don't want to bother installing.Next attempt was to pull the SD card from my LG and just put it in the ZTE directly. No better luck here because although it did see the mp3s on the SD it would only recognize some of them. So much for wanting to customize my ringtones like I have on the LG.Then I took a crack at downloading a SW tool from ZTE called \"JoinMe\". Initially this tool wouldn't even see the phone was there. But then I recalled I'd uninstalled the drivers that the phone had installed. So I went back and changed the setting PC connection setting from Media to Auto Install and once the drivers installed the JoinMe app on Win XP started to recognize there was a phone there but couldn't get the device info. The app had some tips in very broken English that I eventually figured out wanted me to go to the settings, developer options, and activate the developer options and then enable USB debugging mode.Once I did that it started to recognize the device info and it then wanted to push some driver up onto the phone so I let it. However even after it did that, while the JoinMe tool was able to get the device info that was all it was able to do. All of the tool icons at the top of the JoinMe win XP app stayed greyed out. It was like ZTE's own app for talking to the phone couldn't even communicate with it. And just to get it that far required putting the phone in developer mode and turning on debugging, all of which I'm sure is not very conducive to phone security.So I never even bothered to have TracFone move my phone number to it. Instead I called the 800 number on the 30 day no hassle warranty and got a return authorization because after trying for 3 hours to do something the LG can do in 30 seconds (even though it's not a \"smart\" phone) and seeing the meager, miserable documentation in broken English that ZTE has for the Valet I was real sure this phone would be nothing but trouble if I kept it.If your really want an Android phone from TracFone then spring the extra for the Samsung since it is probably not half baked like this ZTE Valet is.

However, I did ultimately get the problem resolved, and because the basic phone I was using did work, I stuck with the service. This week I decided to get the ZTE Valet phone and switch my service over to it... at $80 at Best Buy it seemed like the cheapest and simplest way to get a real working smartphone.I was not expecting anything like an Apple iPhone, or even anything close to it... if it worked it would be good enough for me. Unfortunately, the phone I purchased was defective (no ring tone), although I have to say that I was put off by just about every aspect of the phone -- the plasticky finish, the grainy screen, and most notably the very non-intuitive and glitchy interface. Still, if it had only worked...So I decided to switch my service back to the old phone. I had been able to switch service from the old phone to the ZTE using the Tracfone website, but I couldn't switch back that way, so I called customer service. After navigating Tracfone's automated phone system to get to a customer service rep and a half-hour of being told to \"just stand by\" by a woman with a highly questionable command of the English language, I was told that Tracfone COULD NOT switch the service back, at least not without their sending me a new SIM card. I have to mention that every time the customer service rep attempted to \"explain\" something technical, her explanation did not really make sense -- I'm no technical genius but I'm smart enough to recognize a song and dance when I hear one. I think the whole SIM card thing was just a delaying tactic, as the woman did not even ask for a mailing address (plus she was obviously somewhere in the Philippines). Ultimately she did NOTHING for me... I had spent the better part of an hour on the phone and had to start work (I was calling from my office) and she would not let me speak with a supervisor or even offer an email address.I really HATE IT when a customer service person can't do their job and then gets snippy with me, as though I'm the one selling defective phones. Tracfone's customer service has to be among the industry's worst. When the phones are working, everything is fine, but the minute you need help you should prepare for a real ordeal. I really think this is a poorly-run company and clearly they sell pretty shoddy merchandise (their Amazon reviews appear to bear this out).
