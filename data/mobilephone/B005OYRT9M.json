{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I ADMIRE this phone!!!", "Author": "1Dub79", "ReviewID": "R3L4MQX5CVU7A3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I detested Metro PCS for the longest time. However, I noticed they not only improved their coverage, but made better phones. I was with Straight Talk and wanted to upgrade, but they didn't have a variety of Android phones. Not to mention, the few they had were overpriced. I looked at Metro PCS' website and saw the Samsung Admire for ONLY $59.00 I figured I would give it a try.Applications: This phone has many apps, which can be chosen from. Of course, some of the most popular apps are by default, such as Facebook and YouTube. Other apps can also be obtained for free or via purchase.Camera/Camcorder: Don't be fooled by the 3.2 mega pixel insignia on the back of the camera because the clarity shows a heck of a lot better than the indication. Believe it or not, the clarity rivals the 5 mega pixels on a BlackBerry Bold. Not to mention, the clarity of the videos is just as good.Gmail: This phone has a default Google Mail application, which is cool because I have GMail. Each time you receive an email, you will get an alert, which will have an icon of an envelope on the upper left-handed corner of the phone. If you do not have GMail, not to worry! There is a default Email app, which handles your incoming emails the same as GMail does.GPS: The GPS on this phone is second-to-none. Not to mention, it is probably better than many GPS systems on the market. There are a few apps, which give you GPS navigation. However, I would suggest using the Navigation app. Just tap the microphone icon, and choose the destination, which you wish to travel to. While driving, you are given live, turn-by-turn instructions to the chosen destination. Not to mention, if you go a different route than the one given, the GPS will automatically re-route and modify directions to the same chosen location.Voice Automated Text: For those people, who like to unsafely drive, while texting, this feature is ideal. On the text screen, just tap the microphone icon and speak. The system will actually text what you say. However, don't say TOO many words and speak as clear as possible.Web Browser/Wi-Fi: The phone only has a 3G network. However, it can be very fast, depending on your location. In other words, if you are in a bad location, you may not be able to successfully watch YouTube videos. I would advise to have the Wi-Fi setting on.This phone may not be the best, such as the 4G phones. However, for all it does, and the current price, it is definitely worth owning.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well, I Have Had a Wonderful Experience", "Author": "Michelle My Belle", "ReviewID": "R3MZLG3V2TZ4QZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Despite what other reviews say. I have had NO problem with this cellphone. This is like a high quality cellphone NOT a cheap piece of junk. Much better than the more expensive Verizon I had. The touchscreen is awesome. Works with long finger nails and short, so typing is overall easy. The only let down is battery life, you must keep it on a charger ALL NIGHT or else tomorrow will be a ploof. Picture and video is nice(but I have downloaded the Camera360 app). All the keys work perfectly. You might want to purchase a SD/memory card that stores higher. Other than that this cellphone has NEVER frozen on me. So because I can't give a 4.5 it still deserves a 5 despite battery life.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for the price", "Author": "N.

It's slow, buggy, and apparently shoddily constructed, since I have had hardware issues with BOTH of my Samsung Admires (the first one I purchased, and the one I ordered to replace it).For the 45 minutes or so I was in love with my first Admire...it was cute, sleek, and I could go on the internets. But after a few hours of using it, I could see that the functionality was EXTREMELY inconsistent, and the phone was mind-numbingly, rage-inducingly slow. To make things even worse, in the coming weeks, the phone began to inexplicably power itself off, and the screen flickered constantly. I contacted MetroPCS to see if I could exchange it for different phone, but unfortunately my only option was to order a new model of the same phone.The second Admire I received was the same--just as slow/unresponsive as the other, but at least it wasn't shutting itself off for no apparent reason. I was satisfied for a short time...until I began having trouble with the charger port. When it was plugged in, it would constantly go back and forth between charging/not charging. Eventually, it stopped charging altogether. It is now completely useless.I have since gone back to my 2-year-old Samsung Freeform. I would rather use this outdated non-smartphone for the rest of time than order another admire.I am PISSED...I wasted a good chunk of money on this completely terrible phone, and now I have no option to exchange it or upgrade it or anything...I'm just stuck with a $130 paperweight. GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER SAMSUNG! How dare you put this phone out onto the market!

To get it to turn on, I must open it and put the battery out and in, even then, I may have to do this up to 5 times.  The volume is so low, my friends cannot hear me and I cannot hear them. The battery life is non extent, doesn't even last one hour. Pone turns itself off constantly. I must carry a charger wherever I go as it dies on me. Occasionally, the sounds and ringer work work but not too often so I have no idea someone called. Forget texting, sometimes it sends texts, sometimes.

I'll do my homework next time before making a purchase.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "HANG UP!!!!", "Author": "Katt katt", "ReviewID": "R26CPV0EVNMUF3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well....

I had previously used the original DROID on Verizon. The phone comes with the Android Gingerbread 2.3 operating system and runs fairly smoothly, with easy access to e-mail, web, gps, etc. This phone does well with these basic functions, but sometimes lags. And personally, I have a few apps, changed my setup, etc. and mine lags all the time, sometimes so much to where I can't use the screen lock drawing unlocking option (You draw a certain pattern to unlock the phone on the touch screen). When I try to \"draw,\" it often stops and my finger keeps going, so I have to do it until it manages to unlock, which can make ease-of-access a pain. Especially when I need to make quick calls and the like. The camera isn't the best, but for the price you can't ask for more. It records video and takes pictures, so at least it has those basic functions. All-in-all, with MetroPCS' plan of unlimited talk, text, data, GPS etc. for $45 a month I simply cannot beat it. Even if I had a better phone on Verizon, I'd still be paying an arm and a leg to use it. If you're looking for something that competes with the Droid Razr Maxx or the iPhone 4s, you will  be disappointed. But if you go into it looking at what you're getting for the price, it's worth it if you're on a budget! Good luck! The battery life could be better.
