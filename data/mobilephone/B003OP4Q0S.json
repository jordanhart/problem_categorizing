Also it  charges very fast.I haven't experienced any freezes so far. Touch screen is responsive.

It comes with Android 2.1 (btw I bought from wireless everything and it came with 2gb memory card, 2 covers with silver and peal color, and one soft cover protector). The touch screen is responsive and I haven't felt lags so far. its sound quality and signal reception is pretty good. I was somehow concerned with its battery life after reading some comments from other reviewers. However, the phone still holds 66% level of battery life right now after I received it and had it fully charged 2 days ago. During last 2 days, I test-drove it a lot including Wi-Fi, taking pictures,  playing videos, listening music (but no data traffic enabled).  I should say that I am satisfied with its performance on battery life.Cons:(1)The specs of Xperia X10 mini indicate that it has a 5MP camera. But the size of pictures taken is below 1M (2592x1944 pixel). Although quality of pictures looks OK however I did expect more on this. If someone knows any tricks to take higher quality pictures from the phone, please let me know. (2) The manual/user-guide is not in English but other language which I don't know (probably Russia). But it's easy to download its English version online.Overall I am happy with the phone.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "the fone is a little princess", "Author": "yves", "ReviewID": "R1SB6KUGM4MFDD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "wow! this fone is a little beauty.
