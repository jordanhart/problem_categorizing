{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid phone.  Improves on the Droid 2", "Author": "Patrick L. Randall", "ReviewID": "R2V9G9RQNCFGQ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I initially joined the Droid 'army' with my R2-D2 Droid phone (just a special edition version of the Droid 2) in 2010, I was quite taken by it.  I loved the interface, the wide array of apps, and the very necessary physical keyboard (I have fat fingers.  So, I run into a lot of problems with a touch screen keyboard).  However, as much as I loved the Droid 2, there several issues that proved to be very aggravating over time.  The first was the frequency with which the home screen would lock up.  When this would happen, I could either wait a long time for it to free up, or pop the battery out and reboot it.  The other issue dealt with the touch screen getting wet.  As is likely to happen held up to one's ear or briefly out in the elements, the touch screen will get wet.  In the Droid 2, it would cause the screen to go haywire.  Applications would activate on their own, the finger drag would kick in whenever it felt like, and sometimes it would make calls to people on your contact list when you didn't intend to (this is linked to the application issue).  Wiping down the screen and rebooting the phone sometimes wasn't enough.  So, with the Droid 4, they have improved things significantly.  When the touch screen gets wet now, the worst effect I get is a brief bit of finger dragging going on.  The other major improvement is the home screen stability.  There is still the ocassional, very rare, lockup.  How, when there is a memory or application problem, it is isolated to the application itself (such as the addictive, but woefully unstable, Facebook Mobile app).  You can just go into settings to kill and restart the app.  However, until you choose to do so, none of the other applications will have any difficulty running.  Overall, I continue to be a huge fan of the Droid phones.  I hope Motorola will continue to produce this product line with the physical keyboard.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fine phone, poor battery experience", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RA5PG6S8R7VSW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this phone since a few days after Verizon released it. Keyboard is great, 4G is fast, hotspot works well, dual-CPU makes it fly for most tasks. OS is decent (but rooted it just to install AdAway and make real backups). My major complaint:* By choosing to make the battery non-removable, it meant that not only could I not have a spare ready, but if the port to which the USB power cord attaches gets in any way busticated, the phone soon is dead. The only option now that Verizon doesn't stock these is a two day wait for a shipped replacement phone. *Good thing I bought insurance...

LOVE the physical keyboard!", "Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "R25BJELZEXZJRU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my Droid 4 now for over a year and am still loving it. Prior to this I had a Droid 2 global and Droid Pro, so overall I am a fan of the Motorola Droid line of phones. The biggest pro for me is the physical keyboard. I am not a fan of touch screen keyboards. I don't mind using them for quick tasks, but if I am doing quite a bit of typing (such as this review), I need the physical keyboard. The Droid 4 is one of the few smart phones currently on the market with this feature! The Android software on the phone, which updates regularly with the newest version that is out, runs smoothly and provides for a easy and fun user experience. Because of the keyboard, as well as the phone's wide variety of functions, it has overtaken the use of my tablet and laptop! I have also found the phone to be extremely durable. It has withstood several drops from my 4 year old with out any damage, whereas my husband's Droid Razr Maxx suffered a broken screen after a very small drop. It has also survived two unfortunate immersions in water. One was a fairly brief fall into a water/ice mixture but the other was a fall into a bathtub of water! Both times I was very worried but after letting it dry out it worked fine with no issues at all! I think its ability to \"slide\" apart for the keyboard was a big help, it gave more areas for water to escape and eliminated water being trapped inside the screen area and even worse the phone itself!Now, that I have talked about some of the pros, as with any phone there are also cons.One of my biggest problems with the Droid 4 is the lack of app storage. There is the option to add a SD card and expand the storage capacity but I am hesitate to use this for my applications, so I reserve it for music, pictures, videos, and data files only. That does free up some space for apps, but not much. I am not sure if it is how the memory is allocated or what, but the storage dedicated to apps is lacking. Now, I will admit to using several large apps, including many games, and I have never personally run out of memory but the memory I currently have left is limited. Also, after over a year of use I have noticed some lag when going between apps and browsing the web. In fact on two occasions my phone has froze up when I was using the internet and received a phone call. I did recently install an app designed to empty my cache and that has helped a lot, but at times it does still run slow. The battery life, while great at first has also diminished recently and though that is to be expected somewhat (esp for me as I am rough on my battery), without the removable battery (which no motorola phone currently has) it can be an issue if you are out all day and are on your phone a lot. I did purchase a pocket charger, which alleviated the problem of my battery dying, but still I would prefer a removable battery.Overall though this phone has served me well and continues too. I have no intentions of upgrading anytime soon. I highly recommend it to anyone, esp. if you are looking for a phone with a physical keyboard!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good deal", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R2BI30UHESYJBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gotta have my physical keyboard, got this for half of the retail price.

I was very reluctant to make the jump to a smart phone because I liked the size of my flip phones and the durability.  I've had this phone for many months now and I love it.  I find the keyboard to be easy to type on and I find a lot of the features to be intuitive even to someone who isn't all that familiar with smart phones.The only down side I see is that the battery life isn't super as compared to a flip phone, and even then it's not THAT bad given how much I use it.  I also wish there were more options for cases but that's not anything to do with the phone really.Reception is excellent.  I can get onto Facebook even in the northwoods of WI.  I've had good reception with all of my prior Motorola devices (original Razr, my 5spot, and my most recent flip phone which was pretty much a Razr) when my friends were all leaning over balconies above lakes in winter.  I was comfy in the cabin.The camera is pretty nice, too.  I take quite a few and friends have commented on how much better my phone photos are than theirs.There are so many neat features, I am super happy with it.I just gave up my 5Spot and have learned to just tether to my phone for internet on a 'real' computer.  It's fairly simple, like the other features it's fairly intuitive.  I'd been told you couldn't tether and still use it as a phone but that is apparently false as I was just on the phone and the internet at the same time.I also use the MP3 player feature to upload my music and plug it into the jack in the truck so I can then use the truck's sound system.  Want to listen to your MP3s and use your GPS at the same time?  NO problem, your little lady just cuts in when she needs to and you can hear her over the stereo, too.  The other day I plugged it in with the cord provided with the phone (rather than through the headphone jack) and it just started playing my music without me futzing with the software (still not hard).It is worth every penny.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "T.

It's much faster, has a nicer larger screen, works reliably, and does virtually everything I hoped for. It also has a real slide-out keyboard, which is overwhelmingly the reason why I bought it. (I hate on-screen keyboards -- they offer no haptic feedback, and consume half of the already-tiny screen space.) Virtually no other smartphones offer real keyboards anymore.There are only a few small shortcomings:- When I slide out the keyboard, I almost inevitably wind up unintentionally pressing one or more keys on the keyboard. This is due to the design of the case, which all but assures that a finger will fall on the keyboard during slideout. The Droid 2 Global had a different case design that didn't result in this problem.- The GPS receiver is much weaker on this phone than on the Droid 2 Global. I can no longer get a GPS signal or use navigation if I have the phone under my car roof. I have to place the phone on the top of the dashboard -- with no metal between phone and sky -- to get a signal. This is awkward. The Droid 2 Global had no problems receiving the GPS signal under my car roof.- Like the Droid 2 Global, the Droid 4 camera suffers from an unpleasant behavior while taking still pictures -- the moment you tap the \"Take photo\" button, the camera defocuses to take a blurry image. (This isn't due to hand trembling; the effect can easily be reproduced with the camera stationary on a table.)

Very prompt and helpful service merit the overall purchase 5 stars, but contact with the seller is recommended before final purchase to verify the product is as advertised.

This phone is the younger brother of those 2 phones. Amazing keyboard, big screen, apps play wonderfully on it. Besides being very heavy, this would be a 4 or 5 star phone. However...The battery life on the Droid 4 is so terrible that I have to carry around an external battery to keep this phone charged throughout the day. Even right out of the box, the battery functioned like a phone that I had been using a year. I have only had this phone 2 months or less.I have owned the Droid X, Droid X2, Droid 2 and Droid 2 Global...so I am familiar with how terrible smartphone batteries are. The battery on this phone is the worst by far. Are you kidding me, Motorola???I was doubtful purchasing any phone with a battery that cannot be replaced. All my other smartphones, I have purchased as extended battery which increased size and weight but was worth it for better battery life. With my other phones, I didn't have to buy an extended battery until 6 months or a year of heavy use.I'm telling you, within the first week I had to look for something to keep this phone charged which is when I bought a portable battery bank that adds so much bulk that I feel like I'm using one of the Zak Morris cellphones from Saved by the Bell. Not only am I using the portable battery pack but also a task killer to kill apps not currently in use.No, I do not recommend this phone. Trust me, 1 star is totally warranted and if you don't heed my advice and stay away from this phone, you will regret it. I am hearing great things about the Droid Razr Maxxx and their amazing battery life. I would urge you to try that phone.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad refurb job", "Author": "cdmcmillon", "ReviewID": "R2LL5K25IOHDBP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was not impressed with this refurbished phone.

It only gives you maybe a fifth of the usual symbol options and to even use those you need 3 hands. It has the usual shift option but has zero capability for locking it in. So you have to hold it down to use any symbols. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if they put a shift key on both sides of the keyboard but they didn't. Therefore you have to hold the shift button down then reach over your hand with the other hand to type an explanation point.The back light is random and inconsistent so sometimes you'll be in the dark and be forced to use touch screen because your keyboard just doesn't feel like turning on, then other times it could be high noon, bright and sunny, and your phone is just in the mood to waste your battery by keeping the back light on permanently. The voice activation button is also useless. With every other phone I've had, if you push the button it will act within the program I have open. For instance if I'm txting but I don't have two hands ill simply use voice activation to txt, or if I'm using navigation and I'm driving then I'll use it to enter the address I'm looking for. With the Droid 4, you push the voice command button and it will google what you say. No matter what. Doesn't matter that you're currently txting, or trying to enter an address while driving, if you use voice command it will google it, ignoring whatever action you currently have open. Basically this phone has taken every single simple thing and made it as complicated as possible. Even something as simple as rearranging my favorite contacts has been made into this convoluted endeavor.
