It might be a battery problem and whenever this happens my unit automatically restarts. I'm pissed off and I wanted to return this phone but I couldn't. I searched over the internet to find some fix and I tried this out type in LGLG while holding down the alt key and select clear logs this will keep your unit a little fast.You may also want to consider getting this on a plan with BIS because you can't use other apps without it like gtalk, twitter, etc. but you can use fb and youtube via wifi. Well, overall I rated this 3 Stars because it really didn't impress me. I would not recommend this if you want a fast phone.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not fully unlocked :-( + NO GPS", "Author": "Alexey R.

And it's quite handy.However, it is quite annoying to see the TELCEL (Mexican Phone Provider) logo on startup. In addition, there is no option to setup a personal email account - only enterprise, which means I can't normally check my email.My provider's customer support said the phone is probably not \"fully unlocked\". Because of this, I am also unable to register for the BlackBerry Service account.The phone is very nice though, battery works great. But it's quite ridiculous that I can check email on an ancient flip-phone and not on bberry.
