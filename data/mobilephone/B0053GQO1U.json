{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Good Phone....", "Author": "Joey \"buchajo\"", "ReviewID": "R3H8741UEWEROZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I feel compelled to put out some kind of a review on this product even though I didn't buy it through Amazon. I feel like people are bashing the phone unnecessarily because it doesn't meet their high expectations. I bought it through Tracfone directly a few days ago. I bought it through Tracfone (via a phone conversation with them) and it came with Triple Minutes For Life - for $59.99 + free shipping.I will say a few things about Tracfone's service - it wasn't that bad - and then I will focus on the product itself. I transferred my old Tracfone number to this new phone within 1 business day. Had voicemail set up by Tracfone within 2 business days. They spoke decent English during our phone conversations and they ultimately got done what needed to be done.Now, about the phone itself - folks it's a $60 phone! Let's keep things realistic here. If you're dropping calls it's probably because of the area you're in and not the phone itself. People say I sound clearer through this phone than any phone I've used in the past - I believe I'm using T-Mobile's network, if you're interested.The phone is excellent for phone calls and texting. That's what a slider phone is supposed to be good at. It's nice it has a camera and the capability to play music but I'll never use it for that. I have an iPod Touch that I use to play music with, if I feel the need. I really like having the pull-out keyboard on this slider phone - I sometimes text/email from my iPod Touch and I hate the virtual keyboard. If you text more than you talk and you like the freedom of no contracts why in the world would you get a smart phone? To date, I haven't been much of a texter but with the arrival of this new phone I see a LOT of texting in my future. It's just so easy to do now.People have complained about the ringer volume on this phone. I don't see the problem. At '7' it's plenty loud and at middle age my hearing isn't exactly perfect anymore either. So, unless you're completely deaf.... in that case use vibrate.I wouldn't recommend using the web browser on the phone. I don't even see why they put it on the phone. It's a phone that you use to call/text with not surf the web. So why bash the phone if it doesn't surf the web well. If you need for it to do that for you then don't buy the phone in the first place! I've never seen a Tracfone phone surf the web well. So, for those of you who weren't aware of that, now you know. I've accidentally activated the web once and lost a minute or two. Not exactly a big deal.The phone comes pre-set so that it locks within several seconds of not using it. You have to hit the unlock button and then okay to unlock the phone (even with no password) so it's unlikely a person is accidentally going to press the 'right' keys from with inside their purse/bag and start using up minutes.I can't speak for the issue of battery life yet because I've just had the phone for a few days but it seems to be reasonable so far.All in all, based on what I've experienced so far, I would buy this phone again in a heartbeat. I just want people to see the phone for what it really is - a really decent phone to text/call with. You could nitpick about this phone all day just like you could nitpick about a million other gadgets. The reality is that it does what needs to do and I believe it does it well. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung T404G & Net 10 Service", "Author": "PGardner", "ReviewID": "R398NI0ZN2AVGZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found this phone on sale for $29.99 (not on Amazon) and bought it as I had Net 10 service on another very cheap, no features phone. I love this phone. It does everything I want it to do and no contract. I have had a Net 10 phone for 4 years now and have had to call customer service on many occassions. I have never had the trouble the other reviewers refer to. Although, I am sure I have been really lucky. And, I do most of my changes on-line and only call as a last resort as it takes forever to get through to someone. The service for my area is wonderful.

It was my Christmas gift this year, brand new at a big box store for $80.This phone is only partially enabled and drivers seem to be intentionally absent...and I'm not alone in that belief. I ordered the data cable on Amazon (do a search on here to find it and the 25 reviews...) and then read all 4 pages of people who have had the same issue with finding drivers to interface this phone to computers. I'm confident, after a couple of hours of searching, that this is not an oversight on either Samsung's part of Net-10. If it were, there'd be some mention of that operation in either the user manual or one of the websites. There's not...it was intentional. Here are Amazon, there's 24 other users have the same opinion...under reviews for the cable...in the end you will give up out of sheer frustration and just send photos via text message, creating $$$$$$ revenue for Net-10. To send 5 photos you will use a minimum of 20 minutes talk time. It's not convenient at all and the video/voice option is useless without the ability to transfer.Also, while there is an online tutorial on Net-10's website for the download of music to your phone, it is flawed. You can't download music from your hard drive for the same reason...if you download them via phone browser it will take 10 minutes and you'll need to replace the minutes faster. BTW, you can purchase downloaded music for your phone directly off the Net-10 site...what a shock.Samsung participated in misleading consumers by not installing the drivers. If you buy a Verizon enabled phone I guarantee you this isn't going to be an issue...it was done intentionally for this vendor.Bad, bad form!!!!!!The speaker on this phone is very low. Even on the high setting I can't put the phone on the dash of my car and use it as hands free while driving. It's roughly 50% of what I'd need sound wise. There are no speaker jacks, it's all blue-tooth enabled. You can't use the generic car charger kits either; just bite the bullet and get the one designed for only this phone.Overall, I'd say keep looking...", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "$79.99.....Really?", "Author": "James Paskell", "ReviewID": "R3VCM5LTC1331L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the same Phone from amazon for $32.99 but with TracFone service.

Although some people say Net10 will ban your phone if you use WAP-accessing apps like Opera Mini, so I'm gonna contact Net10 and ask. I got Pico and Opera Mini on here so far, and when I get my microSD card I will definitely put some more on here.For the price of $29.99, I'm getting a steal, specially since this is a no contract phone! I didn't buy it on Amazon, just to let you know.I bought this to replace my other useless Net10 phone with no features on it, and I must say this satisfies me. It's got everything I need! The only downside is how many minutes Net10 is charging me for some of the stuff, like sending/receiving picture or video messages would take 2.5 minutes to download, [for receiving only] and 1 minute to open. And the web browser is insane! If you accidentally start the browser, you just lost a minute.I only got the $15 monthly plan with 200 minutes each month because well, I'm not rich, I'm 15, and needless to say I have no job yet.Other than that the phone itself looks nice, it fits in my pocket nicely, and I am going to put some music and videos on it when I get my 4GB microSD card.The only downside is that I don't know if I can get apps on there. I played the preloaded game on there, and they all run Java, so I'm assuming I can load up some Java applications on here.And to those who likes to watch YouTube, I don't think this phone can do it. When I clicked on a video it just gave me \"unsupported format\".Overall, if Net10's service is good in your area, and you need a cheap (price may go up, this is supposedly on sale) and feature-filled phone, this is a good choice.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone for texting!", "Author": "Sherry Combs", "ReviewID": "R2Z6P9HFKD0C9F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone with Net10 service for about a year. I got it because of the price primarily, but I wanted a phone that also seemed good for texting since I was new to that. Since then, I've gotten a bit addicted to texting, and I love this little phone! True, the camera isn't the best, although it is adequate for basic pictures; however, it takes nice sharp photos outdoors in good lighting. I've taken hundreds, and I've been able to use many for \"wallpaper\" on the phone's screen. It also does decent little brief videos. Photos and videos are easily transferred to a computer. Battery life is okay, and the other features like the alarm clock, contacts, etc. are okay, too. Nothing spectacular, but definitely okay. The slide-out keyboard is really nice, and I've learned to text quite well on it. Net10 service is weak where I live, but it's no worse than any of the major companies here, including ATT, Sprint, etc. In areas where any cell service is strong, this phone is just as strong as any other. One can connect to the Internet easily as long as the service signal is strong enough, but I rarely use the phone for that. I use my laptop or my Kindle Fire for Internet service, so I have little need for a phone that goes online. Personally, I think ANY phone screen is too small for frequent Internet use (including smart phone screens). I occasionally consider buying a different phone because I've never liked the \"candy bar\" style of phone. They're just too short for comfort, as far as I'm concerned. But, so far, I've yet to see a keyboard that I like better than this one. I think I'll just keep using this little guy. Overall, it's a good little easy to use phone, and well worth the money.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent semi-smart phone with some issues.", "Author": "Don \"Don Eitner\"", "ReviewID": "RJFJH6JWDXHA8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I don't talk on the phone enough to justify a monthly plan.  I also don't text or browse the web enough from my phone to justify a data plan.  This semi-smart phone (has some basic apps, texting, a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, camera, etc.) with a pre-paid plan was a good compromise between a plain old feature phone and a modern day mobile computing phone.As a phone this is pretty good.  Makes and receives calls with a standard keypad.  For occasional texting it's got a slide-out QWERTY keyboard which is generally easy to use with my average sized adult male hands; it's not the best but it's MUCH better than hitting e.g. 2-2-2, 3, 5-5, 2, 7-7-7 to type on a numeric-only keypad.The camera takes decent photos outdoors and has some settings for white balance for acceptable indoor shots.  Sending and receiving photos via SMS/MMS though takes both time and pre-paid minutes.  Receiving a typical camera phone photo is costing me around 1.5 minutes to receive and another 0.5 minutes to then open it the first time (after that it's saved on the phone and can be viewed for free).  A standard text message on the other hand takes only 0.33 minutes off my pre-paid time.Phone has Bluetooth so it's pretty easy to connect and browse its file system from my Bluetooth equipped Mac desktop.  Now here comes the big problem -- I tried to upload several photos (JPEG) from my Mac to the phone to be used as the phone's wallpaper and around a third of them simply didn't get saved to the phone while another third went automatically into the \"Other Files\" area of the phone which recognizes that they are JPEGs but refuses to let me view them.But as a phone, this is pretty decent overall.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best brickphone", "Author": "jendorbell", "ReviewID": "R2QN6Z062FEJM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for three years under Straight Talk, and I absolutely adore it. It's so durable! I have dropped it and knocked it around, yet I only have one or two scuff marks on the corners of it.---> Texting <----The buttons on the front end of the phone are very clicky and responsive, so texting on it with T9 is very quick and efficient. I only use the slideout keyboard for adding new emotes to the T9's prediction system, because it is very unreliable. One button stroke will occasionally register as three, and it is very annoying. Luckily, this is only an issue with the slideout keyboard, and the number buttons work flawlessly to call or quickly type text messages with T9.The messaging system is easy to use, however deleting ~100 texts can take almost half a minute and the text messages do not group up per contact.---> Apps <---While you can't run mainstream apps like Youtube or Pandora, you can download Facebook and Google Maps. I have never had success with passing Google Maps's loading screen, however Facebook works flawlessly. I have not tried other apps, but it seems that you can buy games on the phone's store or load JAR files on a MicroSD card to install onto the phone.---> Photos and Video <---The phone has a 2MP camera, which I find good enough for my needs. The pictures it takes are better than my third gen iTouch. It has a photo editor that can adjust basics attributes like contrast, brightness, and orientation. The videos the phone takes are not of great quality, but it is still a nice option. Even the 40 second videos I took were too big to send via picture message, however, so I had to send them to my computer with the MicroSD card.---> Speakers <---The speakers are actually VERY good. I copied full-length songs to a MicroSD card and played them through the phone's built-in music player. I was very impressed with the sound quality and volume. Call quality is also very good and crisp, with or without speaker mode.---> Browser <---The browser is good for what it is if you use some hackish maneuvers to get rid of its little nuances. I usually use the browser for Mapquest directions, as Mapquest seems to work better than Google Maps on this phone. One thing I do not like about this browser is that it does not seem to properly store cookies. If I want to check my email, for example, I can't--I have to type my account information and log in manually every single time. The WAP randomly disconnects on occasion, but it's not hard to get back to the last visited page because of the History section.---> Battery <---The battery life on this phone is PHENOMENAL. If I take, send, and receive 5 picture messages a day, check Facebook a few times a day, and look things up online, the battery life will last about 5 or 6 days. And that's after three years of use. If I don't use the internet or take and receive many pictures, the battery life can last about two weeks!I love this phone a lot, and I think it is of very good quality and durability.

I've only had it three months, so that will be further put to the test as I travel more.I LOVE the slide-out qwerty board, which is a major reason why I chose this particular phone. I don't text a lot, but when I do it makes it SO easy.I also wanted a decent camera, which this has, but leads me to the cons:Cons:The phone boasts many features, but some don't work very well (see below).Phone features are not intuitive. For example, I spent roughly 45 min with both the Geek Squad and then Net10 customer support just to figure out how to retrieve my voice mail - which involved re-setting a password I knew nothing about. Very inconvenient.Browser is slow and buggy. Lots of reviews here about that, so no surprise.Big surprise: I CANNOT upload my photos! I've tried using bluetooth - with lots of tech support - but no go.  I tried again, with the recommended (separately purchased) data cable. Still wouldn't happen. Now Net10 tech support tells me, my \"phone is not compatible with my computer.\" ??? I tried with both my iMac, and my PC. Tech support couldn't tell me what computer the phone IS compatible with. Really.I was able to send pix via text, but it cost me almost 10 minutes for only two pictures, and I do not have unlimited minutes. Slow/buggy browser, so forget trying to email the pix. Which all in all, makes the camera pretty useless.Its a good thing I got the phone on sale, or I would be feeling pretty ripped off. At any rate, I am very disappointed.Unless you're in love with the slide-out qwerty board, I recommend you skip this phone.

The 750 minute cards from Net10 for $25 is my best bet. I have no problems with the plans or Net10 themselves (aside from the horrible customer service at their call center) but the phone itself is seriously lacking.Major problems:- No service where I live. At all. I can get service in the city I go to school and work at but even then it seems to be moody. There are times when I got a full bar and it still says \"call restriction -34,\" \"no network\" or \"emergency calls only.\" In instances like this restarting the phone fixes the problem, but it tends to be a pain when I'm in a hurry to get a hold of someone.- Has the shortest battery life of any phone I've ever owned- Pocket Dialing. Usually this wouldn't be a big deal, but it happens way too frequently on this phone. You can't put it in your pocket without it hitting some button. There were too many times I pulled this phone out of my pocket and seen that it took a picture of the inside of my pocket (which depletes up the already limited battery) or opened the web browser (which uses up minutes.)Minor problems:- The phone cuts off by itself for some reason. I don't have it set to any mode that would make it do this, so I can't figure out why it is. The phone hasn't been dropped or gotten wet ether.It has a decent camera/video recorder on it though.

I purchased a tracfone enabled one from here a little while ago. Here are some things you should know before using one of these from tracfone or Net-10.1.) Don't expect to be able to transfer things off of it without using your minutes.  There's no data cable and even if you buy one, the drivers are absent.  You'll have to up/download things with the phone's browser or text/photo message.  This includes music.  Sure, it's technically an mp3 player, but you'll spend a fortune downloading your own music or buying it off the vendors' sites.2.) The qwerty keyboard on this phone is the worst I've EVER used.  Buttons stick or don't actually work until you press them a few times.3.) This may have been just my phone, but it was an absolute NIGHTMARE to activate. I did everything I was supposed to online to transfer my tracfone minutes and service days over but 4 business days later I still couldn't send/receive texts or calls. The phone however, was perfectly happy to chew up my minutes while I tried.  It even took two people on the phone helping me at tracfone customer service to get it going.  I won't comment on the usual reviews for TF customer service here...I gave it two stars because the bluetooth on it did work and I didn't have to transfer all my contacts over by hand.  It also does OK making calls and sending texts.  Be warned, though if you go to reply to a photo message it automatically does so as a photo message also unless you change it (chewing up more minutes).

If fully shut down, meaning no contact with service at all, I'm still getting a drain on the small powerpack, and maybe it will meet the 5 days said by a commentor.  So lemme get this straight.  Buy a cell phone and cut it off.*Last time I checked, Mobility was Key to a cellphone.  This unit requires an umbi.  The keyboard functions seem to work well enough, but if I send one text, it takes 2 hours to recharge the phone via its internal computer board.  Lemon?  Maybe I got a bad charger or Phone.  Actual functions work all the way within the device, Samsung, and I like the company.  It's kinda crummy, though, that I have to tend to a device that is supposed to be set for stride.  My having to keep dinking with a charger EVERY night kinda sux.  No Gain.I find there is a reason enough to warn customers that this phone Eats the Battery.___________________________________________________________Update.  It dies in 1.5 days.  I'm going to contact the Company and see what they can do.It may be a lousy battery, so I'll see what the warrantee says.  Phone itself is cool.Way it is, though... EVERY NIGHT I gotta plug it in.

It's a bit frustrating that all I have to charge this with is a wall-charger. - That said, it charges rather quickly... but I tend to ignore it when it's on the charge.2) IT USES A PROPITIATORY CABLE FOR IT'S HEADPHONE. This is the MOST FRUSTRATING AND IRRITATING thing about this phone. You either have to (a) buy terrible ear-buds with the right connector (and all I have been able to find for the phone IS ear-buds), or (b) buy an adapter... which may or may not actually work for your phone (as I have yet to find an adapter on amazon that lists this exact model). WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU USE A PROPITIATORY CABLE FOR A DAMNED HEADPHONE JACK? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS COMPANY WAS THINKING, BUT I'M SURE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH MAKING MORE MONEY AS THIS PHONE IS AMAZINGLY CHEEP.3) It is really difficult to find the SD card slot. Admittedly, part of that is probably my lack of understanding of phones, as a friend of mine was able to locate it in a couple minutes... but it even took her a moment longer than I assumed it should take to locate the slot... as most phones have the slot on the side.4) You cannot lock the keyboard/number pad unless you are on the home screen (aka, not within texts or contacts or any place other than the home screen). I would like to be able to lock the keyboard right after replying to a text so I can easily put it in my pocket and not have to worry about pocket-dialing someone. Sadly, this is not an option. If you are in any other screen than the home screen, it will black out the screen but the keypad remains completely active, meaning if you put it in your pocket, you risk doing who knows what with your phone.5) This is not my experience, but I have known others that have had this phone that state that the keyboard is often unresponsive. I have not had an issue with this, though I just purchased it barely 20 days ago as Straight Talk offers very few slide QWERTY phones.As everyone has said, this is a sad excuse for a Samsung. I have had many Samsungs over the year and been very happy with their functionality and, well, just about everything... but considering today's phones (vs 8 years ago when I had my first Samsung), this is really the bottom of the barrel. It might be great for some people, especially considering the service carriers that support this phone offer very cheep service, and it is *ok* for someone who just wants to text - but considering the SD slot and that people will also want this for music, and will likely expect a little more intelligence in function out of Samsung...I sincerely suggest trying to get an unlocked phone with a slide-QWERTY-keyboard and just buy a SIM card. This phone is really not worth it if you want more than easy texting.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Net10- customer service", "Author": "Miss Lee", "ReviewID": "RKL1B9IVA2SJ0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I agree with this person on the customer service.

I have had the same issues with the phone's call quality as other reviewers: I have not had dropped calls, but the voice on the other end sounds faint and cuts in and out.  I have also had problems with messages not sending due to dropped reception.  I know that it is not my carrier since this is the third phone I've used with them.  Also, this phone never notifies you that the message didn't send, so you only find out if you check your sentbox manually.My biggest issue, however, is that it is not possible to customize the sounds you will hear when you get a text message (which is a common feature of most modern phones, even low-end ones).  The description of the phone says you can customize \"ringtones,\" but they mean only what you hear when you receive a call, not message tones.  For message tones they give you a set of four annoying noises to choose from, and there isn't even any trick or \"hack\" to get around it.  I like to be able to hear my phone, but the nails-on-chalkboard quality of these message tones leads me to keep it on vibrate all the time.Between the never-sent texts and the inability to personalize text tones, this is a pretty sad excuse for a \"messaging phone.\"  I'm returning it.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "the LAST samsung phone I buy... Ever.", "Author": "shariee in sac town \"music mania\"", "ReviewID": "R1KSDJN37BTBO2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I thought I was upgrading from the LG900 which I've had from Net10 since April 2011. But soon found out, it was a downgrade and a very downward spiral of  \"can'ts\"; \"won'ts\" and \"not a chance\" with this cheap, low end Samsung offering. This isn't my first Samsung; so I should have known. But I fell for it-again. Before I had the Net10 LG900; I was with Straight Talk for a short few months and during that time had the Samsung R455c -which is such an annoying phone that I should have been permanetly turned off Samsung. I immediately went back to Net10 when they began offering the 750/$25 plan; and got the LG900. I wasn't in love with the LG900; but lived with it for over a year; but recently decided to upgrade- hense the Samsung T404, but this will definately be my last Samsung. Ever. While this isn't the absolute lowest of the low end non-contract phones, it comes pretty close.First, the good: it has a pullout qwerty keyboard, with the letters and numbers clearly outlined and spaced a good distance apart. Texting can be done either with the qwerty keyboard, or with the standard predictive text using the number keys (I forgot how much I missed this option, most phones with only the qwerty keyboard don't have this). While, I can't say texting is easier with this phone- (Samsung has added extra steps, you can't just add from your contacts with one flick of the button, but rather two or three) it does type easier than most blackberry style type phones.another good: it has also voice activated dialing, which is handy in car or when you don't feel like using their annoying search function.The bad: the MP3 player. And trust me, it's bad. I was hoping I would not have to lug around a separate music player to work or to the gym; but this MP3 is so bad, they should not even advertise it as one of the key features. It does not, I repeat DOES NOT play WPA's songs. I loaded a 8GB mini card a few years ago with a lot of my favorite music that I can just switch from phone to phone and not have to reload. Not so. Most of my music I downloaded from CDs so they are in the WPA format. Which this phone does not recognize. Are you kidding me, Samsung? Even your lowly low- end R455C played all my music. This junk T404 won't. It can't. Not a bloody chance. The music player is not user friendly or easy to operate. You have to create playlists (under Games and Apps... really? I mean, really Samsung?)  And it does not play songs in song number order, but rather alphabetical. This is just lazy. I mean, to create a MP3 that doesn't play songs in the order its meant to be played.The ugly: the size limit for ringtones, and alarm tones is 300k. I don't know about you, but there aren't many songs that size. Most songs on my memory card are around 5000k (these songs are just three to four minutes, so they are not huge); so I am out of luck AGAIN in personalizing my ringtones. I hate this. It drives me crazy and I can't think of WHY any phone company would have this little design trickery built into their phones. Trying to get me buy ringtones online, perhaps? Think again. I will live with your little annoying beep beep beep. I also would like to wake up to Amy Winehouse talking about \"you're no good\" instead of the beep beep beep blaring me out of sleep, but Samsung thinks that 300k is a good enough size to limit my ringtones and alarm tones to. Wow. They are getting more ridiculous by the second.The downright mean and ugly: the special Samsung charger/headphone jack. Have a lot of standard 3.5mm headsets lying about? Well, they won't work with this junk T404. Samsung has created a special jack that means you have to buy special headphones and chargers to work with this phone. I have 3.5mm headsets probably in every room in my house, in my car, at work, etc. Well, now I have to carry around both 3.5mm for my Kindle and other MP3 players AND a special Samsung adapter and/or Samsung headset because they have rendered 3.5mm head jack redundant. All because they wanted to be special. Give me a freaking break. So, unknowingly I bought this stupid phone without knowledge of the non 3.5mm standard jack; and have since purchased: a Samsung headset with microphone (amazon), 2 adapters to convert to 3.5mm (amazon) and a charging/USB cable (amazon). All because those idiot developers wanted Samsung to be special and make its consumer spend more money on extra stuff that will ONLY work with Samsung. Even the lowly, crappy R455c didn't stoop this low, but hey,maybe they didn't realize the huge market in the non- contract phones and now will nickel and dime us of every cent they can think of. The T404 can't do much, won't do what you ask; and there is NO chance in heck you can get around it.My review of Net10 is as it's always been (for the past six years): it's probably the best bargain prepaid plan available. The only problem is the selection of pay as you go phones. The phones suck. If you go with the unlimited for $50/month the selection goes way up; you can even bring your own android and just purchase a Net10 sim card. But if I'm paying that much a month why am I with Net 10? I could go anywhere and take my phone number with me. So for the 25/month I pay, I guess I will have to bite my lip on the crappy phone selection; and just bare it. :(Very unhappily, I may add.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Problem fixed", "Author": "Tigger", "ReviewID": "R25XG0OXZGS4AF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered a phone (T404G)from this seller was not able to get the phone to be activated.
