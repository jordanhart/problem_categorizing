{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Epic survivor of a phone", "Author": "Martorano", "ReviewID": "R60ASKXAOBBKW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone, though it lacks several features that most phones of its kind offer, is very durable. My Blitz has had some glitchy periods where it would reset or shut off completely if it was dropped just a few inches onto a table, but it has also been through many big trials. I fell in a river with this phone, had it dropped off a 15 foot roof onto concrete, and it got buried in snow for over 2 months. After all that, it has one button that doesnt work, and just a couple surface scratches. If you are a rough person with your phone, this one will survive. In its prime especially, I would get a lot of comments on how nice it was due to its size and the fact that it slid open. It can nicely fit into any pocket, and though it sometimes would make calls in my pocket, the key lock feature worked pretty well at keeping things from happening. This was my first contract cell phone and I was very pleased with the service I got from it.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Okay teen texting phone.", "Author": "Kimberly J. Simms \"Wits End Poetry\"", "ReviewID": "R3RCIJ11SEYEA2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I don't talk on the phone much, but wanted a phone to text with. So this was a good fit for me. I buy the $10 a month texting bundle from verizon (All in network texts plus 250 other texts).(Although I used this phone for a year, the phone stopped charging eventually. Now I have a Jest).The camera works fine, although the only way to get the picture off the phone is to text it to a friend with a smart phone. The phone's mobile web works okay to check your status on facebook etc (.99 per 24 hours), but it does not support apps. Basically the mobile web is okay if you are out of town or something, but it can be frustrating to use since it is not an \"app\" device.I like the qwerty key pad a lot. Plus I think the phone looks really cute. Really this is a great phone as a texting device.On the downside, I could never really get the MP3 feature to work well. When I plugged my phone into my computer to copy the songs onto the Mini SD card, it didn't work right.I enjoyed my phone for over a year, but then the battery stopped charging. I had bought my daughter one of these phones too, but the battery also died after two months (I had switched the batteries between the two phones, so it is possible my first phone killed the second battery).While this phone was originally $75. I certainly wouldn't think this phone was worth more than $30 now. You can get a new Jest for $50, which is the more recent version of this type of device.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Verrizon Blitz inpulse pay as you go phone", "Author": "Anca Nitescu \"Anita\"", "ReviewID": "RDW1RADWML1GY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seller very reliable, delivery was very prompt and the item came in brand new package exactly as described.I would recommend this seller to anyone.Also the phone seems very good with a lot of good features.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "thanks", "Author": "antranette", "ReviewID": "R3LY52TI44IY10", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "hey thanks for the phone it was nice doing business with you hopin too see more itwms from you as well", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002RC69PE"}}
