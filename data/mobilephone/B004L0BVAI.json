{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Has some good features and some less than good!", "Author": "HWWoman \"HWWoman\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q39IB1CB0RYI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used this phone for many months now.  First off let me say that I don't talk on the phone while driving.  This cell phone would probably be less than ideal for that.  However, if you want to talk and drive without holding the phone, you can actually put it on the seat next to you and use the speaker phone feature with the phone case open.The outside of this cell phone is not pretty. It is very blah - the numbers are in shades of gray.  Inside the phone, however, you have a very cute and functional keypad with mirrored sides.  The key pad is ideal for texting and the speaker phone works very well in my experience.  Also you can listen to music if you want, but there is no regular headphone jack so you have to purchase an adapter.  This phone takes a micro SD card.Video quality and features are not good.  You can only take clips of 30 seconds or less.Supposedly the camera has a zoom feature, but I haven't found it yet. Maybe I should call the company about this.That said, the camera is perfectly adequate for capturing still shots when you don't have your camera on hand.  I have used it to take many photos (hundreds) and overall I am very impressed.  The camera is apparently a Samsung 2 MP.  It is great for photos for Facebook and takes up very little space on your computer hard drive.  If you want to take photos of people, you will need to ask them to stand still.I have the $10 AT&T; unlimited internet plan with this free phone.  It is basically only good for looking up phone numbers on websites.  I have also used it to go to Youtube, but it is a very basic internet plan and I really can't recommend it other than for occasional use.  It is often unresponsive and slow.I am holding out for now before I splurge on a new phone. Truth be told, I may turn this phone into a camera at some point in the future.  This phone is mechanically sound with no problems whatsover.  The keypad is immaculate because it's housed inside the camera.  I protect the exterior with clear plastic film.  I purchased a pink rhinestone bling case that's as good as new after months of use and extremely durable.I really love some of the photos that I have taken - sort of fuzzy and artsy if taken in low lighting, but crystal clear in outdoor lighting.Update November 23, 2012:Well, I have purchased a replacement phone, but I am sad to let this one go. I loved the camera. It had a unique feature of actually lightening up some photos.  I have a feeling that I may be disappointed in my new cellphone camera (even though it is 8 MP vs. this 2 MP camera).  I took a few pictures with my new cellphone (Samsung Galaxy SIII)with interior lighting, but some of them were blurry, especially with some motion.  I didn't see this happening except with motion with the Pantech phone. I have taken almost 3,000 photos with this camera and most of them were more than acceptable and some were spectacular.  My cellphone is still in mint condition except for some minor scratches on the front.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Half baked piece of $#%^^!", "Author": "S.

Everything has pros and cons so here are the pros.  My daughter got this in pink, and it's pretty.  It has a flip open design with a qwerty keyboard.The cons?  Ease of operation isn't the best.  It take multiple steps to perform many functions which doesn't make sense.  The phone is not durable.  The back cover does not stay on.  Google it and you will see it is a known common problem.  I emailed Pantech when this phone was a few months old, after buying a skin for my daughter, and realizing I needed to get a new cover so the skin could be applied.  They said they would mail out a new back cover.  This was in May and it is now September.  I've been going back and forth with Pantech and they have given me lame excuses like it will be mailed out next week, it will be mailed out in 4 weeks, we are forwarding your email to a supervisor.  None of which got us the cover.  She was talking on the phone the other day, and I actually saw the back cover fall off, she dropped the phone because of it and the camera lens cracked.  I emailed Pantech (AGAIN) telling them what happened now because of the back cover not staying on and their response to me was that the camera lens cracking is not covered under warranty because my daughter dropped the phone, and that the back cover will be sent out within a week.Please do yourself a favor and do not get this phone.  We are going back to AT&T; in hopes they will do something for us because Pantech is not.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice phone with good features", "Author": "diva", "ReviewID": "R1HW3AO3OMOMYR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second pantech.............I'm not into the new Iphones etc but this particular phone I've been using for quite some time.  I like the keyboard as my nails are longer and its easy to text....navigation is good and good sound quality when on a call.  Its a tough little phone too as I'm dropping it constantly.Actually this is a back up phone as my original phone is ready to be buried.One thing is the back panel does tend to drop off when the phone ages.

Since I don't have cell service around where I live, this phone is for going to town, texting there and taking photos where I like.  This is a different style phone than I had, (slide open phone), so it takes getting used to.  I like the texting keyboard and the quality/loudness of the speakerphone.  The viewing port for the photos is definitely poorly placed as it is on the very right hand edge of phone where finger tends to be in order to aim.  Also am used to having a different ringtone for each of my contacts and that's not available on this phone(it was nice knowing who's calling by ear!)  The touch screen on the front is nice although it's a bit touchy at times. With Bluetooth in car,  I dial one of my speed dials and set phone down and it will disconnect from the slight bump.  Overall I like this phone the quality is good and what I expected.  The size is good and works well.  I was thankful to find a phone with the features I need still on the market and not forced to purchase a data pkg. that I have no use for.

Almost all run into various issues, all needed to be exchanged when under warranty, and once out of warranty, Pantech support is minimal at best.  Read the other reviews.  This model is no exception.  It is riddled with design defects that Pantech ignores.....battery covers that won't stay on, phones that shut off by themselves.Only one Pantech model has performed well, the Pursuit/Pursuit II.  Every other, most notably the Impact and the Link - AWFUL.I won't even go into the features, as this is just a bad phone and you should avoid it.We maintain our phones and keep them protected, not mistreated - this are just junk.  And if you call Pantech, even willing to buy replacement parts, like battery doors, they tend to have no spare parts, probably because they get used up replacing all the defects.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "My teenage daughter had this phone for years!", "Author": "KarenH", "ReviewID": "R372VEDCHT1JHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My teenage daughter had this phone (but in blue) for at least 2 years.

The camera is alright for a first phone.

Also, a glitch has been occuring and whenever I turn on my phone (and persay I have 115 messages in my inbox) and it will say \"115 new messages\" making me delete all messages. Also, the back cover came off twice and I was not able to put it back on, I ordered a new one which came within a week, but the same thing happened.

I love the QWERTY, and I am pleased with the speaker. I am not pleased with the lack of a 3.5 mm headphone jack though. To use a headset, you must purchase a $10 adapter, or you can buy headphone/adapter sets. I understand it's an older phone though, so I can accept it. Also, the charger is kind of obsolete, so don't look for a universal that will fit it.  In action, the phone works well. I have had no problems with calls or texts, and the layouts are pleasing. It's not difficult to adjust settings to my taste. So far, I have noticed one design flaw, and that is the numeric touchpad on the front of the phone. Sometimes, the keys become unresponsive, especially the END key. I have to press it multiple times to activate it, and there have been several occasions in which it does not work at all and I am forced to open the phone and manually end the conversation.
