Just don't expect the same features of a Samsung Galaxy or an iPhone, when you are paying only $ 49 for it. It is a little slower than those other phones, because of the small RAM memory, but overall it is a very nice phone.

It freezes, it crashes, it has a miserable ~210MB of usable RAM, and 160MB of storage space. It drops calls if you so much as look at it funny, and lags like you wouldn't believe if you try to do anything more strenuous than type a text message.But the sound quality isn't terrible, so you can make phone calls, you can go on the internet (provided you have a wifi connection, as this phone doesn't do 3g and will be painfully slow if you try to use your service provider's data connection), you can check Google Maps, you can send emails (just don't have high hopes on them leaving your outbox very quickly), and you can send text messages.If you have more than $50 to spend on a phone, do so, because this phone isn't so great.

I read reviews and wasn't expecting anything too spectacular - and I didn't get it.With the preloaded apps and OS, there is only 43MB of phone storage available.The phone, which is the main function I bought this for, is atrocious. If you can actually understand the voice on the line, it sounds as though its in a tin can.
