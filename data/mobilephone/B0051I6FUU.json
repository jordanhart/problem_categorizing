I didn't have the money to pay hundreds of dollars for a new phone and a friend told me about possibly purchasing an unlocked phone.I must say I was nervous about purchasing an unlocked phone because I heard many negative stories of how there could be issues with internet service and other services that my provider ATT has. However, so far I have not had any issues. As for the phone itself, I LOVE IT. I needed an organizer first and foremost and this phone delivers. I love the style of the phone as well. The phone is very user friendly. I must say, I am not a very techy person so I don't have high demands for millions of apps, but the one draw back to this phone is that I have not be able to find many themes for my phone and the apps are few and far between, I'm not sure if its ATT mall or if its because of the model of phone.However overall I am a happy camper because the phone was affordable (new) and I am very pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Looked great, but....", "Author": "Beth H.", "ReviewID": "R1JQML3TLKYZ9Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone looked great on the website.  It was unlocked. However when I received this phone, it looked to either be refurbished or used.  The battery was a generic battery and didn't say \"Samsung \" on it like the picture showed.  The manual in the box was also a very general manual and wasn't phone specific.  For the price, I felt it wasn't a bad phone.  I would recommend the phone but only with advising someone of the previously mentioned issues.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "M.

This is the worst phone I have ever owned.  It gets extremely hot when used over 10 minutes.  I mean hot as in painful burning on your ear.  When it gets hot, I could hardly understand what was being said by the other person.  It was muffled and seemed like it would cut out and lots of conversations were totally unintellegable.  After about 4 months I started getting the lighted grey screen and the phone would lock up.  If the phone wasn't burning my ear, or locked on a grey screen, it shuts down all on its own in the middle of the conversation.  Even with a brand new battery, these problems still exixt.  It's best use is now as a paperweight.  I won't even donate this to the women's shelter!!", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "A+ phone!
