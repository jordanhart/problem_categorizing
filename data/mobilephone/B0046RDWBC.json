But in reality the market is saturated with more Android as anything cause there are more apps, but  that doesn't make none better, they all have the equivalent in its own operating system. But one difference this HTC HD7 being a Window based operating system is the one of the Best, for ease of operation, if you have a computer you know windows, it is very attractive,very responsive, the screen is large 4.3, icons also,all the main features are right in front 1 click away do anything , easy to understand for everyone including senior citizens and young kids and people who don't like read books and weeks of learning and some get so complicated we send the phone back. Yes I highly recommend this phone, to any one, who wants to be ahead in technology with a great smart phone, as great but much more simple and so easy to operate than many new smart phones.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "HTC T9292 HD7 Windows 7 16GB GSM Quadband Phone (Unlocked)", "Name": "T-Mobile HD7 Smartphone - Bar (610214623669)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41zCh86N4qL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0046RDWBC"}}
