I had purchased online, so it was international i9500. Battery bulged and had standard issue that is widely reported in the press. I called Samsung USA. They refuse to change the battery and say that it is international. The phone is British EU based. I checked with IMEI number also. Samsung US claims the phone is from Syria! and refuse to replace the battery. Well that's it for customer Service. So warning that the international phones have no warranty! I am amazed at their utter lack of customer Service.Galaxy S4 is  an incredible phone. I have been using this unlocked S4 for past 2 days helping a friend to migrate from iPhone 4S. My friend has been on iPhone and it also gave me a unique perspective. I used iPhone for couple of years and been using Android for past 3+ years.I have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4.

As I do, I've noticed that the phone is constantly looking for my face (or any movement) Even when I am not directly in front of it I can see it reacting to other things going on in the room. Certainly this is the cause of the battery drain. I imagine that battery technology just isn't ready for total hands free phone use.

Remington", "ReviewID": "RWD4WN10ZHSG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung S4 cell phone is the hottest and newest phone on the smart phone market.  This Android device has gotten much press and rightly so.  In terms of specifications, the S4 has a lot going for it that has it as the leader of the pack over many smart phones.  But at first glance, this new phone looks and feels much like its predecessor, the Galaxy S3.  So what makes this phone different and why should you be interested in purchasing it?  This review will explore those issues and help answer that question.When you have a good thing going, why not start with that as your baseline.  Samsung has done just that with the S4.  The S3 and the S4 are very similar on many levels and very different in key areas.  Their size is essentially the same at 5.38\" x 2.75\" x .31\".  This actually makes the S4 .7mm thinner than the S3.  Its weight is 4.6 ounces, .7 ounces lighter than the S3.  Comparing the two, Samsung has increased the size of the screen to a 5\" display that offers full HD resolution at 1920 x 1080 pixels.  While other phones offer similar resolutions, none have the same quality image that comes from the Super AMOLED screen offered on the S4.  Side-by-side comparisons with phones such as the HTC One find the S4 shines with more prominent resolution and richer color tones.The screen also has improved capacitance over the S3 and previous Samsung offerings.  This improved capacitance supports phone use while gloves are worn.  Those who live in cold climates or those who are fashion conscious and wear gloves will find this enhanced capability helpful.  While this capability is a nice addition, it takes some getting used to.  Because it is more sensitive, it's easy to falsely register a finger press if you hover your hand over the screen in the just the right way.  Hopefully Samsung can correct this performance flaw with future software upgrades.Regardless, the S4 screen is a remarkable technological creation.  Its visual performance makes it like a smaller cousin of much larger HD televisions.  It is a beautiful piece of work and the highest quality screen of its size presently on the market.At first glance, the camera appears to also be the same as the S3.  This is, in fact, not the case.  The S4 houses a whopping 13-megapixel, rear-facing camera and a 2-megapixel, front facing camera.  The rear-facing, 13-megapixel camera image is excellent.  The imaging capabilities of both cameras extend past the raw hardware with added features built into their associated software.  There is software to do most anything you can think of with the images taken.  Software even uses both the front and back camera to offer all kinds of imaging effects from panoramic images to slow motion videos.Much of the new hardware, software, and extended features built into the S4 place heavy processing demands on the phone's engine.  Because of this, Samsung has integrated a 1.9GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor to help keep things purring along smoothly.  At the time of this review, this makes the S4 one of the fastest smartphones on the market.Coupled with this increased processing power is an expanded memory card slot for additional storage.  Samsung is selling the S4 in 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB configurations.  For those considering the S4 with 16GB of storage, this may be a bit limiting.  Approximately 6GB is eaten up by the OS and installed apps, which leaves a scant 8-9GB of storage.  This is 2GB less storage than the S3.  The S4 supports the installation of up to an additional 64GB using a Micro SD card.  If you're considering purchasing this phone, you might want to add a Micro SD card to your purchase and expand the base memory, or purchase an S4 with a higher amount of integrated storage.Keep in mind that the more data you add to your Micro SD card, the more information the S4 has to parse.  If you have a 64GB SD card packed with pictures and videos, when you open the Gallery to view them, even the quad-core processor will crank itself silly to host them for you; it will take time for them to display.  There's no working around this.  It's the nature of the beast.  Just accept this as a current limitation based on processor speed and storage mass.The front of the phone contains a number of additional sensors that monitor eye movement and proximity so the phone knows how far it is from your ear.  An infra red blaster is integrated into the top of the phone to enable it to act as a remote, with the appropriate app installed to function as a remote.  These sensors and the infra red blaster offer many new features not available with the S3.  The phone can act as a remote control for your television, CD/DVD player, A/V receiver, and even home appliances that support remote control.  The eye sensor offers additional features that control screen dimming and auto pausing when you look away from the screen.  Likewise, when you look at the screen, dimming and auto pausing resume their normal operation.Applications available to support the additional sensors include Air View, Air Gesture, and Smart Scroll.  While these features are futuristic and helpful in theory, they aren't flawless in practice.  They are also rather complex to learn and use, which detracts from the concept of simplicity when it comes to operating the device.  Take this into consideration when adopting the phone for your use.  Not all the features have to be used at once.  You may find some features helpful while others are an annoyance.  They are all highly configurable and it will take some time and practice to set them up to your liking.Like the S3, the S4 supports Samsung's S Beam and near field communication (NFC).  S Beam allows two Samsung phones to be placed back-to-back so they can share multimedia content such as videos, music, pictures, etc.  The devices only need to be placed a few centimeters from each other to link, and, unlike Bluetooth, no pairing is needed.  Communication is provided by WiFi Direct, which makes transfer speeds quite good.Samsung has received many user complaints over the quantity of polyurethane used with their phones.  They are plastic centric in construction and many consumers feel this detracts from a robust, solid feel.  The S4 seems to have taken this into consideration with the addition of a flat metal bezel around the side edge of the phone.  Much like the iPhone, the S4 has a metallic edge that augments its former plasticized edge construction.The case itself is similar to the S3.  The rear cover is easily removed to reveal the battery, SIMM card, and Micro SD card.As for battery life, the S4 stock battery is 2,600mAh compared to the 2,100mAh S3 battery.  This is a 20% increase in battery size with no added thickness to the phone's form factor.  In fact--as stated earlier--the S4 is .7mm thinner than the S3.  This added battery storage is required due to the increased screen size and additional features and applications.  Each person's use is highly personalized, so it's difficult to gauge how this battery will perform with your personal use, but, in general, it seems to be an adequate amount of power storage for moderate use.  Still, it will more than likely require daily charging.  If this is a concern to you, you might consider an extended-life battery.  These batteries are freely sold on Amazon and other locations, but most of them require an aftermarket back to the case that will replace your stock rear cover.  Extended batteries mean heftier weight and added thickness to the phone.  Another option is to purchase an additional battery as a backup for when your primary battery discharges.Out of the box, the S4 comes equipped with Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2 and a huge amount of software.  If there's one complaint about this phone it is in relation to the amount of features and software bundled with it.  The S4 has a mountain of software that, at first glance, can be absolutely overwhelming.  It will take time to sort out and learn everything this phone can do, so pencil in an evening or two to explore, configure, and learn what's new and how to use it.  The list is far too extensive to cover in this review, but it should be stated that every feature the phone has is supported by associated software.  In addition to this software, Samsung has packed new applications to satisfy every possible type of user.  You may find it all useful, but this is doubtful.  Most likely, you'll use a subsection of all the software installed and make it your own.  One could say Samsung has given the consumer the benefit of choice by adding so many features and so much software.  Sometimes it's better to have too much than not enough, and this is true here.  Rather than be overwhelmed by it, see it as a library of possibilities that supports a healthy amount of functions.  Decide which functions are useful to you and learn them.  For those functions and applications that hold little interest, leave them alone for now.The S4 is an enhanced deconstruction and reconstruction of the S3.  If you currently own the S3 and are considering an upgrade, take stock in the added features and capabilities of the S4.  The S4 will give you the latest Android has to offer; a larger amount of storage space; a fabulous HD screen; a high-quality, 13-megapixel camera; huge amounts of added features and software; and a fantastic processor under the hood.  If these things are important to you, then the S4 may be an exciting upgrade.  If you're happy with the features and performance of your current S3, then you may want to save your money and stay with what you have.Overall, the S4 is a brilliant device.  It's not without its flaws and there is always room for improvement.  While Apple performed wonders defining the modern smartphone, Samsung has helped take the concept one step further.  If you're looking to upgrade your older smartphone and break into the Samsung Galaxy world for the first time, the S4 is a fantastic selection.  It is, arguably, the best Android phone on the market, at present.  Some may say it's the best smartphone, period.  Each person's decision and opinion is highly individualistic.  One thing is for sure, Samsung has pulled out all the stops to ensure consumers get the most for their money, and they have set the bar even higher for newcomers to take the mantle of achievement to a new level.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, but be aware you may need your own american charger.", "Author": "Jamie G.", "ReviewID": "R35FSEEV2M371B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone in early June and have had it for almost a month.

When it had arrived I have noticed that there is a small space between touchscreen glass and body of the phone (about 0.5 mm) from both sides. Also plastic back cover was not closed properly. I have put small pressure from the sides of the phone and those spaces have gone. A moment after that I put my Otterbox cover on the phone and did not remove it till this month. I was mistakenly sure that the issue with the spaces was fixed, however when I removed my Otterbox case, I saw that the spaces are all the same dimesion and if I do not use any case dust comes into the phone! If I try to apply some light pressure on the sides of the phone, the spaces come off for certain time and then come back again (I can just assume that the touchscreen glass is U-bent and assembling was not conducted properly). Moreover, when I came back to Ukraine (I am not planning to come back to USA at this time) I have found out that my Galaxy S III does not have possibility to connect to Internet via cell operator service and needs to be re-firmwared. I am sure you understand that it was my intention to buy Unlocked version of the phone to avoid such problems in my homeland!I have visited numerous diagnostics servises who tried to adjust settings but without any success, also they advised me that these spaces between the glass and body of the phone are factory defects for sure. I have also visited Samsung Service center in my city who told me that the guarantee is covered for the goods purchased only in Ukraine and to change firmware will cost about $20-30 and to fix the issue with spaces - around $200-250 (change of touchscreen glass).I like my Galaxy S III but I cannot enjoy it in full because I think it is unacceptable to know that the dust can easily enter the phone without any mechanical damage done from my side and to bring such a big screen phone without access to Internet. Internet connection with T-Mobile in US was ok.After contacting My Wish-List  I was advised that there is nothing can be done in this case and I should stay with my problem alone. The only thing I was offered is a small amount which was their profit part \u201cas a gesture\u201d what did not solve the issue at all.Thus, guys, be aware that this seller does not provide guarantee for the supplied goods (the Guarantee voucher is also supplied without any stamp or other evidence when you bought it and you will stay with your problem what ever it is on your own.Hopefully something will be changed in near future.Yevhen Ivchenko/An Upset Customer Of The Above Seller.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of the best", "Author": "Santiago Ochoa", "ReviewID": "R1P4WC3CD0EOGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Galaxy S4 is one of the best phones ever.

I have to admit I am not a Techy. I just like Tech toys. There are multiple Techy reviews available for this phone so I wanted to review it for the \"every-day\" user.My previous phone was an iPhone5 (I've also had the iPhone4) from ATT and luckily, my wife took that phone and I was able to get the Samsung S4 from ATT. I've had the Samsung for a week now since it's release last week and below are my thoughts on everyday use.The Pros:The screen is amazing. The larger screen is significantly notable compared to my iPhone5. On paper, it doesn't sound like much but when I open the same Apps on both phones there is a huge difference. Reading and surfing the web is much easier on the eyes (it might be that I am getting older eyes now that I am officially in my 40's).The Widgets are very cool! Having information quickly on my screen is so convenient.The expandable memory slot is great! I wanted a phone with larger memory but the ATT store only had the 16Gig. So, I ordered a 64Gig micro SD card and now have 80Gig phone (although there are some limitations as I will write below)I've been able to download most of the Apps I was using on the iPhone but there are some differences. For example, I love the AnyDo App but it's not as good on the android as the iPhone (lack of calender view, etc)I almost forgot... it works great for phone calls :-)Cons:The Samsung is not as intuitive or as user-friendly as the iPhone (Disclaimer: this may be that I've used an iPhone for several years)The Samsung does not \"play\" nice with my bluetooth devices in the car. For example, I like to use a bluetooth headset for phone calls when I am in the car and the car's bluetooth for the music. On the iPhone, the transition from the headset to car was easy and flawless. On the Samsung, it does not want to switch devices very easily.I wrote above that the expandable slot is great to have... the deficiency is that you have to determine when/how the external memory will be used. To further add to the confusion, you can't control this in the Settings menu under \"Storage\". After hours of trying to find where to go (as you can imagine the 16Gig is used up quickly if you put all your music, photos, etc.) I accidentally, found the \"My Files\" folder where you can decide how the external memory will be used... Again, another example where it is not as user-friendly as the iPhone.Samsung claims that it is easy to \"transfer\" music, photos, etc from iPhone. This has not been the case for me. Their \"transfer\" software was glitchy and did not work well-only some of the information transferred. I've also downloaded Samsung Kies (I think this is their effort at imitating Desktop iTunes) and, again, it does not play nice with the phone. I have a 2013 Dell laptop with Window 8 and, OFTEN, Kies just stops working. I have yet to transfer even my favorite playlists.The voicemail function isnot as nice as the iPhone. They are not organized in a visual manner.The default setting is that the large Power button on the side will disconnect a phone call if pushed (this is easy to do by accident - I've accidentally hung up on a few people)but the setting can be changed.Overall, I like the phone (4 out of 5 stars) but it is definitely NOT an iPhone Killer. I would say that, overall, they are on-par with each other but differ depending on your predominant use.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone didn't last 3 months", "Author": "Ade1", "ReviewID": "RQ646CAI46RG5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone was delivered to me in early July and less than 3 months, the phone isn't working anymore.

That along with the great screen resolution allows for some very nice-looking and smooth gaming on the phone. Another nice feature in here that the iPhone still hasn't gotten for some reason, is NFC (near field communication), which allows small data transfers just by putting your phone within a centimeter or so of the other device or tag.

Take this phone, if you have one, and compare it to the iPhone. Better yet, play a game, or read something on S4 then try to do the same on the iPhone.I don't know which governance of the 5th order decided to play secret \"fan boy\" marketing, but iPhone has died a while back. I honestly don't think that's going to effect the global market, as long as one makes more money, and we make the deal.As far as this phone goes. Yes. It's plastic. But it's lighter than you think it should be possible. Yes. The design is boring as hell. But once you see the screen, it's simply amazing, how much resolution this bad boy commands. Yes, it's faux aluminum, but who the hell care? I have yet to see an iPhone user carry their \"amazingly beautiful\" iPhone without some ugly ass case that adds about an inch on every side.Do you know what's so great about this phone? It's the fact that people who knows, and who does their research knows that this is the best phone in the market... EVER, and there is a large enough market to protect this phone from shattering and it'll still have this massive HD screen at more pixels than the iPhone.I like this phone. Not just for the game, but the speed of how things happen. Real Racing 3. My phone! The graphic on this phone is amazing, and I'm pretty sure, iPhone isn't there yet. They're so riding the good thing for the last 10 years or so, they forgot what made them great in the first place. I mean, come on, give Jonathan Ive the 90% control of the company, and have the corporate MBA's run the BS.You're just judging the book by its cover if you like Apple anything. Trust me, as an industrial designer/graphic designer for a long time, I've grew up MAC. Now, they're obsolete, and they ride on their reputation. Don't get me started on their tax evasion from USA, and modern day sweat shops they run to make your precious crap-phone.  It's so outdated, having iPhone today is like having only the beepers when the Motorola Razor came out.After few weeks, I think Samsung did a good job. I actually prefer how HTC does UX, and they do it a lot better than Samsung, and Samsung needs some people who can speak up to their management, because I think they have no leadership at that company. If they had, they would know that even though people are right handed, and especially right handed, people would hold the phone on their left to use the phone with their right hand. Why the hell is the back button on the right side? Also, why is the home button a push button when either side of the home button is a touchscreen buttons. Tactically, it's the stupidest thing ever. I don't want to tap, then push. Honestly, I don't want to push anything, because my mind doesn't want to adjust to that ONE button that requires more pressure than the other buttons (like the keyboard).I found that this phone gets really greasy. No idea why. I've had a lot of phones in my life, but this phone, for some reason, gets my hands greasy. No matter how much I wash my hands, and clean the phone, it just gets greasy, which is something that's never happen to me before. It's almost like the plastic and the screen is injected with grease, almost like an iphone.Battery life at 2600mAh is at 40% by noon from 7 am on normal use, like reading the news, playing few games, checking emails, sending emails, taking few pictures.  That's with constantly killing task through Samsung's own task killer program.Anker battery is what I got, since they guarantee the NFC with the phone, since apparently that's a big problem with the aftermarket batteries. Something about resetting the data, or something...Overall:I wish it had another OS, like one from HTC. I really liked my HTC android. It was intuitive, and the design was thought out, both industrial, and software wise... The only thing about HTC One is that you can't change the battery on it. That's the only reason why I got this phone, and I don't really reg... oh what am I saying... I wish HTC One can have the back plate open, then I would of gotten than, even though the bench mark for Galaxy S4 is higher than HTC One.If you have an amazing car, but if you can't drive it around the corner, because the car isn't balanced and not thought out, then your slightly under power, better balance car will make you happier at the end of the day.Overall, Samsung needs to hire some new UX people, because they all either suck, or the corporate decision that's conservative is what's killing this amazing piece of phone that can, if you want, take you back to the future.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "S4 is fragile and cheap.....and Samsung knows it.", "Author": "Darci", "ReviewID": "R2N52WDA4GFTIJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "S4 is fragile and cheap.....and Samsung knows it.Here is my story. Shortly after the S4 was released I decided to give android a shot. I had been a loyal IPhone customer, but the big beautiful screen was enough for me to take a gamble, and now I am paying for it.After about 1 month of use, somehow the phone developed an internal crack on the LCD. The phone had never been dropped, never had my 7 year old and my 3 year old play with it (side note: all of my IPhone have been thoroughly slobber/drop/sat on/thrown down stairs tested). There is no reasonable explanation for the internal, not external, screen to crack. But there it was, a tiny crack in the top right of the screen.Distressed I immediately ran to the store I bought the phone from. The girl at the store proceeds to tell me they see this ALL THE TIME. That she has seen someone that, while removing the 4S from the case, somehow managed to crack the internal LCD, just by removing it from the case. Basically that you just always have to be really careful and never put any kind of pressure anywhere on the phone. Wow, something that most people keep in their pocket and the store is telling me you can't ever put any pressure on the phone. She then tells me that she can't help me because even though it's an internal crack, they will still claim that it is damage and it won't be covered under warranty.I moved on to Samsung. After having the store switch my phone account back to my IPhone 4s, slobber, and everything, I called Samsung. I explained my problem to the girl and she said she can't help me, but that she would have someone call me back within 24 hours........25 hours later I called Samsung back. Needless to say I was annoyed. That fact that Samsung didn't even bother calling me back made me think they must be having major issues with their phones.  I asked the girl about this and she simply apologized, but couldn't explain why I hadn't been called back.  I again explained my situation to the girl on the phone. Her name was Octavia. Octavia explained to me that if the problem was in fact internal then Samsung would fix it for free. I was ecstatic. She emailed me a shipping label to send my phone in. (The email had the wrong address...sigh...I called back and talked to someone else, and he sent me the correct address.)I immediately sent the phone off to be fixed by Samsung.  After over a week Samsung calls me back to tell me that they can fix it, but it will cost me $200.00. I asked what they found and they said the LCD was broken. I asked so the \"internal\" LCD. They said yes. I asked about what Octavia had said about fixing any internal problems for free, they said that doesn't include the LCD............so basically. I told that guy he needed to find someone to explain how I go from anything internal will be fixed for free to now that we have your phone and have wasted over a week; we want to charge you another 200.00 for your plastic phone.I am currently waiting for someone else from Samsung to call me back. I am going to go out on a limb and say I am going to have to call them back. The bottom line is that the S4 is a terribly plastic design. Maybe the active is better, but I am thinking they probably made the active once they realized how incredibly fragile their standard design was.Avoid the S4 at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Ronald Bickham", "ReviewID": "RF3T3XF92C0RU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am learning and enjoying this phone, but I hate the battery life.

Career wise, I am in technology so this phone appealed to me.  I was frustrated with the iPhone adapter change, even though probably needed and improvement.  I desperately wanted profile management options which I could get in the Samsung.  I wanted it to work.The Pros:-Screen so big even our older eyes can read the small print.-Camera was absolutely amazing.  Quality was great, some of the effects were incredible or simply fun.-Nice style-Apps galore.-Audio quality was a step up over iPhone 4.-Regular mini-usb connectors that most phones use these days.-No iTunes needed.  :)-The plastic case did not bother either of us.  Felt good and light.-If you do not like something, there is an app that will probably suit you.-I like the Widgets but practically, it is not more efficient in most regards.-Has Google Maps-You can add extra RAM-Removable batteryThe Cons:-Screen so big you almost always have to use two hands-People blow the Samsung technical specs out of proportion.--Yes it has 16GB of ram but 8GB of that is used before you power it on.  Technically, you are getting a 2006 8GB phone.--Yes you can add your own memory card but not all apps will let you run or store data to it.  So only partially useful.--Yes, fastest processing but even apps with great reviews do not seem to be efficiently written gauging from how quickly they can slow down the fastest phone ever.-If you do not like something, there is an app you can load but each app seems to make the phone slower and slower and slower.  Sometimes the app has its own problems too. (more in a second)-Natively, does not do group messaging correctly.  Replies come back to sender, not group.-Load the highest ranked messaging app to fix group messaging, it struggles to send a picture from either of our phones for hours and sometimes days.  Send from regular messenger, works fine.  So now using two messengers.-The Samsung keyboard is nice that it has numbers on it but we could not get the feel down.  We loaded the Jellybean keyboard and liked it much more. No big deal, just another item to do.- My Profile Management app that was a big reason for the switch was really impressive but not consistent and I suspect the biggest reason for my Samsung to slow down.  An app that does not work consistently and slows down the phone is no more beneficial than not having the app available at all.-Running Widgets seems to slow it down, and really, if you have 6 pages of widgets, you may do 5 swipes to get to it.  Where if you use Easy/icon mode or an iPhone, you are in your popular apps in one or two clicks.  So neat but truly, not practical from efficiency of getting to the data or the overhead it loads.-The voice to text recognition is YEARS BEHIND Siri.  I tried \"Galaxy\" for weeks with laughable results.  It or I got better but never consistent enough to \"use\" it.  Siri is simply rock solid.  Want a comparison.  Say \"Hello Galaxy\" the built in command to initiate the voice commands on the Galaxy and say it a little off,  the Samsung does not know if you want to look up things about the outer space Galaxy or use it to do something.  Really?  Siri, ask it anything and it gets it.  Ask it something stupid and it still replies with a cheeky but accurate response.-My wife's phone would not keep a charge and froze constantly.  Mine was just slow with the apps and 5 pages (comes with 6 screens loaded) of common Widgets-Transferring items like pictures from the Galaxy had mixed results.  We could not transfer from one computer no matter what USB version port I used, it would crash the Windows Explorer.  On the other system it worked fine.  I would blame the computer 100% but the iPhones work fine on either.-The Galaxy is awkward in the pocket, darn near impossible to get out of pocket while driving, looks stupidly geeky in a holster and almost as ridiculous held to your head.- I found the Air Gesture, eye scanning movement stuff to be neat but unreliable.  I turned it off.- We both experienced issues with our screens not keeping their settings or apps in the nested folders.  Very weird.We went to the iPhone 5-One handed operation-Rock solid performance-We actually use Siri... it works and is helpful-Maps seem decent.  No issue thus far.  I am a fan of Google Maps though-Don't want to purchase a bunch of the new iPhone charge adapters?  Look at something like the Mophie case with built in battery.  You can use the common mini-USB to charge your phone, while protecting your phone AND increasing iPhone battery life up to 120%.  Pricey but pretty cool.  (However, have to remove the bottom of the case to do anything data related.  No big deal to remove the case but a con)-Fits comfortably in the pocket even with the Mophie case.-I admit, going back to iPhone 5 seems a little elementary feeling compared to the open ended Galaxy but bottom line, this is a cell phone/smartphone.  I want to use it, not tinker with it.  iPhone simply works.My suggestion:If you are an old iPhone user, over 35, not into tinkering with your phone, or have small hands / do not like bulky items, I would lean towards the iPhone.  I love Samsung products and this phone has a lot of potential but it came up way short for me.  My wife was done with it before I was but after a few weeks I had to admit, it still felt cumbersome in every aspect. This is a phone and to me it should be reliable like a toaster.FYI - ATT has a NEW, REDUCED FROM 30 DAY, 14 DAY SWAP POLICY!  After that, you are buying your replacement at full purchase price or setting up a \"ghost\" line with a two year agreement to move over to a different device at a lesser cost.We returned our Galaxy's after two weeks and went back to iPhone, on the 5 version.  Very happy with the 5.  Gave the Samsung a two because I feel like it should have been a step up and for the over rated specs.  There are aspects of it that are great but for the two of us, it was a step up down, inconsistent or malfunctioning and the specs did not return better performance.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "gift", "Author": "Xiaojun Li", "ReviewID": "R20LO951PX199V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought this for a friend, she asked me to buy this. so i don't know if she likes or not", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unable to download the manual; unable to use straightalk as a provider...", "Author": "S.
