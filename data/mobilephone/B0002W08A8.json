I verified it via Amazon.com before making my purchase of it, and made the purchase.  When the card arrived (only 3 days to arrive), it stated on it minutes expire in 90 days.  I telephoned T-Mobile To Go before activating the card, and confirmed that with any existing minutes on the phone before activating this card, the existing minutes roll over with the new 1000 minutes for the card, and don't expire for one year.  Another positive on this card is that once you exceed $100.00 minutes purchase, you become a premier status, and your calls are reduced from 25 cents per minute to 10 cents per minute.  I'm thrilled with this card now that I know the facts about it.  I was told by the T-Mobile rep that the 90 day reference on the card is for those who have no existing time on their phone, and also to prompt the customer to activate the card in a timely manner.  I hope this clears it up for other prospective buyers.  I'm new to cell phone useage, and only got one for emergency or urgent situation use.", "Date": "January 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "New information as of May 2005", "Author": "D.

However, now it appears that this policy is changed for new accounts.  Unless you initiated service before the policy changed, now you need to add $100 each time to keep the .10/min.A beneficial change to their plan is that now roaming is included on these plans.

Amazon ships this item on tiny turtles if you use the \"supersaver\" shipping, so don't expect it next week if you purchase it with this option, but since you save on sales tax, and if patient, can get it shipped for free, any whining such as mine about shipping speed should fall on deaf ears.

I just added my 1,000 minutes and I have a full year to use them. The phone came with $15/60 minutes and the initial balance also rolls over to 10 cents a minute. Plus I didn't have to pay sales tax or shipping with Amazon and it arrived in three days. T-Mobile customer service is very helpful and even gave me a tip to save minutes: use a land line to check voicemail.January 6, 2007 update - I tried to order a refill card and after placing the order found out that the $50 card is on backorder...since I needed the card right away to renew my minutes, I cancelled the Amazon order and shopped around a little more. You can find these cards online for even less than face value and receive the pin right away. Since I am a T-Mobile Gold Member (have previously purchased a $100 card) the $50 card is also good for a year and calls are still .10/min. No matter whom you buy it from, I think T-Mobile is great...if you start out with the $100/1yr card the price is only $8.33/mo for 83 minutes.", "Date": "January 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "good buy", "Author": "Mary E.
