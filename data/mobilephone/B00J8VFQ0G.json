If you are planning on using this as a phone, don't bother.  I purchased this phone from an authorized dealer whom also activated for me.  The number that was activated on the phone was not the number that showed up in the status of the phone itself.  After Cricket giving me a new number not once but twice.  They still could not get the phone to work properly. Then they finally got around to porting my real number which got totally messed up.  We are now on the 3rd help ticket with their help department, after being told by the manager that the previous help ticket numbers did not exist in their system.  We are now going on 10 days with a phone that does not work at all as a phone.  On a good note I can tell you how to activate the phone and reset it in my sleep and even how to manually program it. I bought this phone for the Muve Music plan.  I thought it would be fun for my daughter.  However Muve will not work across a wifi connection and is absolutely totally useless at this point in time.  I am currently looking at turning it into a VOIP phone with Nettalk and just using it for an mp3 player and the wifi apps.  I don't think I have ever had such pathetic service from a company in my entire life.  I was debating between this phone and the Optimus V.  I made the mistake of going with a company for the music service and not with the company that I previous had that I knew to be reliable.  Cricket has told me that it will be up to 7 days before I may be contacted with help on this ticket. I will update this review at a later time to see if this ever gets resolved.  All that I can say is that I am a very patient person that is considered by most to be very tech-savvy.  So if I am giving something a critical review, which very rarely occurs, on an electronics device then I would certainly take this into consideration before deciding on your purchase.Finally last week, we have a working Cricket phone. This is after threatening to file a complaint with the Attorney General's office and the Better Business Bureau.  We still had to fight to get compensation for undelivered plan time from Cricket which was nearly an entire month's worth of service that was never delivered.  The issue was not with the phone or even the account.  It was an issue with the port of the phone number on Cricket's end.Now that the phone works, my daughter is extremely happy with her phone.  Images and pictures look gorgeous on the phone. Unlimited music downloads are a teens dream come true.  Most of her friends are only allowed to text so the 1,000 minute limit doesn't matter much to her.  The phone itself is great and has typical Samsung excellent quality.  It needs a bigger memory card, 4G is totally insufficient especially when 3G is permitted for music and only 1G is for everything else.  Poor planning there.IF YOU ARE NOT PORTING A NUMBER, then there is a good chance that you will like this phone.  If you plan on porting a number then you are at the mercy of Cricket Customer Service and I wish you luck.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "YES YOU CAN SWITCH RATE PLAN!", "Author": "Claudio Rodriguez \"claude\"", "ReviewID": "R2W560N28MMZHT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay so many buyers have complained about the paygo muve music plan for this phone.

Their own website clearly states that the SMARTPHONE PLAN and the MUVE MUSIC plan are compatible with this phone.

Read carefully.", "Author": "Jordan", "ReviewID": "R3O8SYW0YLGESW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm going to make this review as clear as I can so that you serious researchers know what you're looking at. It's a very good phone, the Muve music is a very nice quality to have. This phone does require the $55 monthly plan, but I was aware of that before I bought it. It's just like any other Android phone (I've never had an Android before, but I've played around with a friends.) It can connect to the internet by WI-fi, or by the data plan. It shipped, and delivered, quicker than it was supposed to. There are a few issues with it, which I'll try to clear up for you. Firstly, after you've registered online, it instructs you to dial *228 on the phone to program it. A lot of people have had problems with this, as it says that it can't program. You need to keep calling that number until it programs. I had to call close to 20 times. I've read that this is an issue with Cricket's network, not the phone itself. After I got that sorted out, I realized that I couldn't call or text or anything. I had purchased the plan with the activation. I added another $55 to my account, and then it started working. Now I have an extra $55 on my account. I'm hoping they'll take that for my monthly payment instead of taking it right off my card. Another thing I noticed, is that MuveMusic will not work when the Wi-Fi is turned on. If your not connected to a network, the internet will not work either. When the Wi-Fi is on, your phone will try to connect by Wi-Fi, instead of your data plan. So it's probably best to leave the Wi-Fi off. I don't get very good service, most of the time the phone is at 2 bars, but no matter how low it gets, it doesn't seem to slow my connection down at all. The battery life is also painfully low. It seems that it takes longer to charge than it does to use up, but I plan on purchasing a backup battery for $10 on Amazon. There are just a few issues to work through, but if you get past them, it really is a nice phone. I'll be keeping this one. And the price is a great deal!EDIT:: I have decided that I will not be keeping it as a cell phone, as there are just too many disadvantages. I will be keeping it instead as a device similar to an I-pod touch, as in a mini computer. The Wi-Fi makes this worth it. It can be used as an MP3 as well. If you turn it off when you're not using it, it preserves the battery a little more. I will also root it, and download a Terminal Emulator from the marketplace, as I enjoy command line much more than GUI. As a side tip for all of you Android users, make sure you have some form of protection. I use Avast for Android. While this can't prevent all attacks, it's better than nothing.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid phone, not limited to Muve plan!", "Author": "SP82", "ReviewID": "R6MJXKMTPQAG7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My phone died a couple days ago, I had an LG with cricket. It was decent enough, but lacked flash and couldn't play Netflix, and finally, the touchscreen died. I thought about switching to another service that was even cheaper, but their only android model didn't have good reviews. I almost didn't get this because there were mixed reviews about whether you could use your existing unlimited smart phone plan that Cricket offers for $55/mth.  I didn't want to pay $65 for the muve plan (which is what an existing customer will have to pay a month to switch to the muve plan), but I thought I'd wing it anyway, based on another review where the person said after some tooth-pulling they were able to get the regular unlimited data plan.  I figured I could always return it if it didn't work out.So as an existing customer, I just called them, and when they asked for the ESN they activated the phone, no problems whatsoever. They noted that it was \"compatible\" with the muve plan, but said I could just continue using my unlimited plan at $55 instead of switching to the muve plan at $65. Obviously, I opted to stick with my regular plan.So, for existing customers, I would say you shouldn't have any problem keeping your regular smart phone plan at $55, and if the customer service agent balks, hang up and call back until you get one who knows what they're doing. I can't speak to new customers, but when I checked into activating the phone as a new customer online, it did honor the $55 rate for the muve plan, so I don't know if that's just a special deal linked to this particular phone or what, but I didn't end up going that route.As for the phone itself, I love it! It's lightweight but doesn't feel flimsy, it has flash and works with Netflix, and is definitely faster than my other phone. I haven't used the Cricket 3G yet so I can't speak to that but it's otherwise a very responsive phone. Otherwise no changes from the standard interface. I would recommend getting a hard case for this phone, I could see the edges cracking if you dropped it. I bought one for 6 bucks.

Cricket's 3G is very sluggish and unreliable and I wouldn't recommend it to someone who absolutely needs lightning fast coverage and the ability to make calls everywhere. I think the service problems have more to do with Cricket than the phone, so I can't dock the phone on that.It does occasionally spontaneously reboot, usually in my pocket on a hot day. This happens with every phone I've had. It's not the most capable phone, but for an entry-level Android, it's a huge step up from a 'dumb phone' and doesn't suffer from too many bugs. But there is one major problem with this phone that the product description fails to mention.There is ONLY 200mb of internal storage. In comparison, most smartphones have at least 1GB. I don't know who the genius was who thought 200mb would be enough for any smartphone, but it is a huge flaw. I currently only have 12mb free and can no longer update Google Maps, Facebook, or any other app stored internally because there is not sufficient storage available. Yes, there is 1GB available on the microSD card that comes with the phone, but only about half of the apps in the AppStore can install on the SD card. Most major apps require being installed on the phone itself and all apps install in the internal storage by default (you'll have to manually move the apps over to the SD card in the app settings, if it's even possible). MuveMusic by itself uses up 40mb of the 200mb and I still use the original FB app that came on the phone (as opposed to the memory-hogging newer versions). I don't really have many apps on my phone and it's already down to 12 mb. I still have plenty of SD card space, but unfortunately alot of apps can't use it.Had I known the problems that would arise from it's lack of internal storage, I would have bought a different phone. If the phone had 1 GB or even 500mb of internal storage, I would give it 4 or 5 stars. It's still a 3 star phone because it's the most reliable and capable phone I've had (minus Cricket's iffy network) and for less than 100$, a great value. Cricket's PayGo plan (now 50$/mo with unlimited minutes) is cheap and good for anyone who doesn't always need great coverage or fast data. Aside from it's huge flaw, it's a fine phone.As for Cricket, the company is fine as long as you don't run into any problems. Talking to their CSRs is somewhat difficult (mostly outsourced to foreign countries). And there's alot of disconnect between sectors (CSRs giving me different answers from Cricket store salespeople). The company has a bad rap with people who expect decent customer service. If you don't rely too much on talking to salespeople or customer support and can figure things out for yourself, Cricket is fine. If not, I'd suggest just spending the extra dough with a bigger company.Important numbers to remember:*729 to top-up and pay (and remember PayGo is prepay)*228 to reset/refresh network communications (do this with any phone problems prior to calling support)", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sucks Battery Power", "Author": "Christina Barnes \"Amazon Shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R34WPH1CQIDIH6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The battery on this phone dies so quickly.

Samsung uses its own firmware with gpsd as opposed to gpsone from qualcomm which is already in-built and interfaceable.  Unfortuntely theres is no multi-mode support and is locked into network mode, Samsung have removed the interface to change this since gingerbread on all models.  This essentially means that you can only use gps while on the network not globally as it was designed for.  If youre lucky it will works once per boot or once every few hours as theres no hot start facility.  Unfortuntely this reduces the functionality of phone and many apps, especially google maps which has offline cache.I contacted samsung, unfortunately their first line support arnt technical at all.  They are only trained to throw rebuttals, to get you off the phone asap ' figure pleasing I guess.  After two attempts one guy even told me that my phones not supposed to work (I hadnt even told him it wasnt working) and if I didnt accept it he would put the phone down on me.  So i asked him what will you do if I accept it, eventually he put the phone down o)Eventually the phone was taken back and after a five weeks and two attempts (first time they didnt even look at it, instead fixing unrelated trivial issues) I got it back in worse condition.  Over a two week period the gps eventually failed.  This is because samsung uses cheap one axis spring connectors, and like anything on one axis that is spring loaded it eventually fails.  These appear to be in most of their phones and have a higher rate of failure than previous designs like antenna on board or plug in antennas, these are cheaper to put together and less material - cost saving essentially.  This applies to gps, bluetooth, wifi and cell service, at any time either of these could fail.  In my case they messed one up by opening it up - I could see some of the coating had come off probably where it was pushed down too hard.  With only about 6 parts in this phone you would think they would just replace the entire thing.  Its prohibitied to post external links but if you search around the internet you can find others with samsung models having the same problem.  In the end we soldered it ourselves.Most of their internet site relating to repairs doesnt seem to work either or there is  a lack of info, so you never know whats going on.I later lerned about the single mode system, so it was fruitless anyhow sending it back.  They didnt install these menus in the factory that were issing to change its mode, or even alter its mode.Additionally if you buy this phone now you will get EH29 build which has less gps functionality (fixed accuracy) and faulty orientation software.  So the compass and apps like google sky will stick and spin.  How can a newer build be worse than and older one is beyond me, may be they should rename this company Samsung Logic and call their products dumbphones o)The remainder of this product is tolerable but Samsung only assemble it.Samsung were good at 2g phones but apear to be out of their league with smartphones.I am not suggesting that Samsung are the only culprit as most of the smartphone business particularly android is dominated by far east businesses.  The quality of their products is inconsistent at best.  My advice is you should look beyond appearance, outlandish claims and colorful aadverts when slecting a smartphone.  If you just want to make calls, send txt you can get a 20usb device for this.Im so happy I didnt spend 500usd on one of their phones either directly or by virtue of a contract.  That will probably be my last samsung purchase too.  Incidentally LG uses gpsone and i have used other products of their before and had no problems.  Thats my next phone ill post a review of it and put a link to it here in the future once Ive roadtested it.Update:Here is a full review of my new phone LG Motion 4gReviewer Name: Glyn, Rating: 3/5http://www.amazon.com/LG-Motion-Prepaid-Android-MetroPCS/product-reviews/B008ZE3T7O/ref=sr_cr_hist_3?ie=UTF8&filterBy;=addThreeStar&showViewpoints;=0", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "great way to buy an android", "Author": "DC", "ReviewID": "R3AIKOQ0XNPD0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a way to try an android phone without having to sign a 2 year contract or spending a lot of money, this is the way to go.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone - makes a great Holiday gift!", "Author": "Jim B.", "ReviewID": "R2X4KGRJIFLG9U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Couldn't be happier with this phone - does everything I need it to do and more!

I work at Kmart and saw this one, the plan offered unlimited music downloads and ring tones, and unlimited 3g data, texting, and 1000 minutes of talk time for $55 a month.  It has a 800 Mhz processor, which is pretty good I think, havn't had many issues of it going slow.  It did freeze up when I was in the middle of playing a game that took up a lot of space, but normally it runs very smoothly.  The operating system is Android 2.3, and you can download all the apps from Google Play, which I love, there are so many to choose from.  I love that you can download all kinds of music on Muve Music, you can download whole albums if you want, and they have mainstream artists and underground artists, you'd be surprised how wide the selection is, anything I've searched for I could find and I listen to some pretty out there stuff. Also a great feature, I can play the music and close the application and text, or go online, or play certain apps and the music will keep playing, if a text comes in the music will pause for a second then continue.  The signal on Cricket works good, at least where I live, I pretty much always have a signal.  The apps are great too, I wanted to play old nintendo games on my phone and after downloading the app and the games it works great on this phone, no issues at all.  The 3g internet is great too, much easier to use facebook and google than on my old phone and I can go to youtube also.  You can read books on this thing you can watch movies, record video, it has gps....did I miss anything?  Oh yeah, it's red and black!  My favorite colors lol.  Lots of great features, now for the cons.This phone does tons of awesome stuff, and therefore it drains the battery like crazy, if you get online or play any games, don't expect the battery to last more than 8 hours, if you only text and keep it in your pocket all day, it'll last until that night...so that's extremely annoying.  Also something else that's annoying, and this is just my opinion, but texting on a touch screen drives me crazy sometimes, maybe I just haven't gotten used to it yet.  Also if you are somewhere where your data signal is weak or if the whole phone loses signal, for some reason the phone cuts off and then on again automatically...weird.  That's about it, except also for the fact that every now again if you are doing a ton of stuff on your phone it will freeze, but that wasn't a common occurence for me.So it has its strong and its weak suits, but I like this phone and I think I'm gonna stick with it and if you are in the market for an Android phone and don't wanna spend too much but don't want a piece of crap either I'd get this one, just wait for it to go on sale, I got mine at 69.99.", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "konzz16", "ReviewID": "RLD02FMUGWGDH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Happy with purchase.got here fast .didn't have to deal with returning it.
