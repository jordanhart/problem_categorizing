{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great upgrade from Tmobile MDA", "Author": "Phuong Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2GZO2QGEEDFMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my Tmobile MDA. What I needed/wanted was a touch screen with Microsoft Excel. I update my stats for work on the touch screen very easily. I also like that I can download alot of different softwares that run on windows mobile. This allows alot of customization. The increased ram & hard drive on this was perfect for me. I had to soft reset my MDA daily. I soft reset my Touch maybe once/wk. I bought an 8gb SDHC that can hold A LOT of stuff. I have more than 40 audiobooks; 30+ mp3 songs, a lot of games, 20+ pdf files (scanned documents), and I've only used up 2.5 gb of my SD card. Battery life is very good. The Touch pairs easily with my bluetooth and I can easily talk for 4-5 hrs on the bluetooth and the phone still has 50%+ battery life. Everyone else has to plug in their cell phone. Pictures aren't the best, but it's only 2 MP and I'm used to using a 7 MP, so I really don't use the Touch's camera features. Also, you can set up your yahoo email accts and it will automatically receive all new emails every 5 mins if you want. I think it can do the same with other email accounts but I'm not 100% sure. Overall, I really like how thin and lightweight the Touch is in comparison to my MDA. Hope this helps.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "GREAT!!!!", "Author": "Pedro V.

Fowler \"Sighs Of Life\"", "ReviewID": "R1QXAKNT3R42TD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the phone for over a month, mostly using Wi-Fi for internet and application downloads.  It connects automatically at home to my network. I have not connected to other hotspots, but I see a listing when they are available, but just don't which ones do not require a password pin.  Wish it automatically found the unsecured hotspots for me.  I love all the wealth of Microsoft apps available and most work with this phone.The touch screen is great.  This is the first phone I've owned with it.  Nice to navigate and play games.  The apps like MS MyPhone and Sprite work automatically to backup the phone data.  And Valuephone has three great apps that sync with the computer to keep pins/passwords, addresses, and even grocery and other lists current between up to three phone with that app installed.  The addresses port automatically from the phone's Window's Live synced addressbook and MS Office Outlook.  Office is installed and nice, as is Windows Media.  Absolutely no problem sending pictures to different internet sites, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  You can even check Card and Bank balances, as well as email from other POP accounts.  Everything works seemlessly, fast, and efficiently.The camera is adequate and video quality nominal.  Audio books play fine using Overdrive and sync to the PC Overdrive console.  And it only costs a few dollars a month for the occasional phone calls and texts.  I recommend using Google Voice to save some texting money.  It still displays on the phone when you use the google voice phone number.The browsers are good.  Skyfire shows more details but is a little harder to use than IE, yet has some functions IE doesn't.  Facebook app requires you to relog in to your account to get back to current, refresh does not do that like it should.  Twitter is current, however, as soon as it appears.  A nice addition to the pocket.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Mother board gone with in a year", "Author": "Shishir", "ReviewID": "R3K2DV5UHUR74O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Initially phone looked very good but very soon it became very very slow.

Did I mention the camera sucks?  And put the thing in your holster where it unlocks itself and activates various features as you move about.Hopefully the only reason you are considering buying one is because someone is offering to sell you one for $5 and you plan to hack the Droid OS onto it.  Otherwise there are a thousand better examples of this type of phone.*Call me old-fashioned, but I think the interface element of technology known as a \"button\" has been fairly well defined.  Especially the user expectation that when you press a button, something happens immediately in response, not 350ms later.  This is especially true when revisiting the half-century old experience of dialing a push-button phone.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Device", "Author": "Jean Dubreuil Petion \"Jean\"", "ReviewID": "R1XSM9CCFVD7QN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recomiendo ampliamente la compra del equipo.
