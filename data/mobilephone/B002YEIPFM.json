One alarm only, you cannot set multiple alarms. You cannot upload ringtones without using special software. The cell phone is not being recognized by OS. The lock/unlock mechanism is just stupid. You cannot lock the phone with combination of key, you have to actually click the lock icon. Cannot turn down the ring volume, you have to do it thru switching between different preset modes. It doesn't connect to my WiFi.
