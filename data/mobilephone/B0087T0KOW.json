But it seems like it's really the experience of the 4G speeds and having a smartphone that are more enjoyable than the phone itself. It's packaged terrible because it seems like it's really thick and big but has a small screen. Overall i really don't recommend it. The quality is to low, plus Metro Pcs is the worst, all there employees treat you like s***. A smarter choice is def boost mobile, plus they don't charge you $60 a month for unlimited everything.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I AM ON MY SECOND ONE!!!", "Author": "S. M. Patrick \"Product Investigator\"", "ReviewID": "R3S8FDIAL6AZ3V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am on my second one.  The first one started freezing up, losing pics, losing music.  I thought it was my SD Card, so I purchased a new one!!  Not the SD Card!!  With my warranty with Best Buy, I went back and exchanged it.  It is now doing the same thing!!!  I think I am going to purchase the LG 4G LTE phone. It received 5 stars.This phone also doesn't have the memory it needs for you to download apps.  It comes pre-filled with apps, and they fill up the memory.  Even with a 16GB SD Card, the phone refuses to download directly to the SD card, even though that is the setting that I have on the phone!!!Beware of this phone.  Get one with more INTERNAL STORAGE.... i.e. LG 4G Lite like I am going to do!!!", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Throw Away Stock Battery", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R13GRKN16UXVMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The m920 is great for the price, but the stock battery is drains too quickly. It's about 1950mAH. Do a goggle search for a 3800mAH battery for Huawei Activa 4g LTE. The battery is bigger than the stock but it should come with a custom backing for it.Enjoy!!", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "like Makayla Maroney, I was not impressed.", "Author": "William Sosa", "ReviewID": "R1DHMWHV85X15I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "not a great phone. the phone does not glide as must android phones. teh camera has no focus and the shutter is bad quality. expect very pixled pictures with this phone.

I don't understand the big fuss about android systems ( if this phone is a typical android). It's slow to start up and complicated on thing that should be simple. I have a Huawei m735 and I love it but it's not very advanced - it is simple to use, can hold a charge forever and charges very fast. Why can't they just make the m735 just more techie instead of this battery eating hard to use monstrosity. So if your looking phone to just make calls and use as an MP3 player buy the m735 for a third the price. UPDATE Just bought the LG Motion - now this is a phone. Fast, simple,can hold a charge and is a hot spot. Buy this and you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "just buy a new phone", "Author": "Anastasia Boulton", "ReviewID": "R3ALMV9LIB0R8J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wish I would have bought a new one right away instead of waiting for this one. it had no volume buttons, no SIM card and one couldn't be purchased and it was a very old model. it was useless and an inconvenience.

Amazon Overcharging!", "Author": "Sunshyne", "ReviewID": "R1RRSB423MW1VF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok, so what can you REALLY expect from MetroPCS?!? It's a nice phone, normal basic features, nothing too \"high tech\".. Front & Back cameras w flash, great call and volume quality, storage space is nice, haven't had any issues YET with the dreaded \"running low on space\" pop-up. I MUST say the camera quality absolutely SUCKS! It is horrid! The front cam is so distorted, the rear camera isn't as bad, but it's bad enough! Thank God for Instagram! The land of crappy photo editing! SMH Guess I'll have to continue carrying around my digital camera if I want to capture nice photos! Bah-Humbug!AND FYI, Come on Amazon! As of October 2012.. Metro is selling this phone for $99! Bring the prices DOWN, BooBoo!!", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Great Price", "Author": "*o Nina o*", "ReviewID": "R1F8GCXY9150N0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about a month ago and I love it more everyday.  It's 4G and works quickly.  The battery life is normal.  If I'm not using a lot of apps then it will last all day on one full charge.  The apps do drain the battery but that will happen with any smartphone.  Calls sound good on the phone.  I'm very pleased.
