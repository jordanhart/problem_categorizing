{"Reviews": [{"Title": "What is SVP thinking?", "Author": "Jon \"Jon\"", "ReviewID": "R9MMG3V3QZFHJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've owned several SVP watch phones (silver and black versions of the G13) and a few other off-brands. I highly recommend NOT getting the G14 but instead the prior version of the watch, the G13. The G14 does have a pedometer, and honestly I didn't even try this functionality. I was so upset that SVP removed the following apps. and replaced it with the single Pedometer: World Clock, EBook Reader, Calendar, ToDo, Alarm, CALCULATOR, Tasks, Unit Converter, Currency Converter, Health, Stopwatch... That's right, all those apps. mentioned are NOT on the G14 watch but exist on the OLDER G13 version.So, unless you really really want a pedometer and don't mind all the other apps. being missing, go for it. One thing you'll find on many sites is artwork depicting some of those other apps. being available on the G14. I repeat, those apps. ARE NOT on the G14 and the artwork and descriptions on various sites are absolutely incorrect. You'll have the basics though: camera, video camera, phone, profiles, settings and music player.  I use the calculator frequently, so it was a deal breaker for me to keep this watch (it is in-process of being returned).Bottom line, if you are considering \"upgrading\" to the G14, don't. Send SVP a clear message that you aren't happy about them removing prior functionality to add one function that few will ever even use, the pedometer. This watch is a downgrade at a higher cost -IMO", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "STAY AWAY, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY", "Author": "valjevac ibrahim", "ReviewID": "R1POTY0KIIF07A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP !!!!!1I bought two stylish watches (black and silver) and none last more than a month ; first one had issue with a battery and finally it couldn't be charged up through regular port.....ridiculous...or another \"good deal\"; SVP android tablet 10.1\" after few weeks of decent work simply didn't want turn on...... than I tried to contact so called customer support-service for warranty or returns......It was try.....throwing money for this \"Silicon Crap Products\"", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$69.99", "Features": "Support Pedometer/Speed/Distance/Kcal\nQuad-Band GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 MHz\n(640x480 pixels)\nSupport T-Flash Card 2GB-32GB 1.5\" touch screen with stylus pen\nSupports Bluetooth 2.0 and included in the package", "Name": "SVP The newest Stylish Cell Phone Smart Watch Model The G14 Sliver Camera GSM Quad-band Watch Phone ~ UNLOCKED ~", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iQTnzHcWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DLNF076"}}
