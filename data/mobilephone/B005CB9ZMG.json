{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This phone is junk", "Author": "DC777", "ReviewID": "R2QHCLG3NHL5BX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my mom. It's a nice little uncomplicated phone. It worked well for about 5 months. After that she started noticing the phone was dead when she went to use it. The battery is fine. Turns out that with the skin on, the phone display was not turning off. Even with the skin off, the phone display would turn on in her purse and drain the battery. I suspect the lid pin wore down a bit and is not pushing the lid switch in far enough.I sent it back for repair. They did a page full of diagnostics, updated the software, and sent it back. Despite me identifying the lid switch as the issue, they did nothing to address the problem. I called customer service back and had to listen to the idiot on the other end of the line spend an hour telling me how a lid switch worked. She said I could send it back again, but if the technician found nothing wrong, I would need to pay $15 to get my phone back.Since I already spent $15 sending the phone in the first time, I told her I was not going to take another chance at dropping another $15 on this piece of junk. A rubber band will work for now. I'll replace it with a more reliable product from a different company in 10 months when I update my contract. At least I now have the knowledge to know Sanyo/Kyocera makes junk.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sanyo Vero Cell Phone", "Author": "Ms. \"B\"", "ReviewID": "R2JUD76647OZEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered phone on Friday night - showed it was shipped on Sat and it arrived on Monday.  Took phone to Sprint store and it was put on machine and diagnosed to be in perfect condition.  Downloaded info from old phone (dropped in pool) to new one and new phone is working just fine.  Phone was in great like new condition as described.  Would recommend this seller / would use again if occasion arises.  And I love Amazon for making it so easy and secure, knowing if phone was defective, my money would be credited back to my card.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy to use!", "Author": "S. mojaddidi", "ReviewID": "R2HMP5XNHCT38I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best simple phone in my opinion.

All my callers sounded distorted and buzzy. Because I didn't get wire insurance, I had to send it back to the factory in NY (since it had a one-year manufacturer's warranty). They repaired it, but two months later, the ear piece went bad again. So I sent it back again, they repaired it again, and once again the ear piece failed within two months.Despite my pleas with Sprint customer service as well as the Sprint store that sold me this phone, they refused to exchange it. I've been a Sprint customer for over ten years, and this is the way I'm treated. But the phone is a piece of crap regardless of who the provider is. Not recommended at all.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "good deal", "Author": "taco", "ReviewID": "R28DXSFLLMYRBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Needed a cell to replace a broken cell that was under contract.

The price was a quarter of the price the Sprint Store wanted for a similar phone.  I didn't want a smart phone.  All I wanted was to receive and make calls.  This phone does that! There was no learning curve. My only regret is that my contact info could not be transferred due to the condition of my old phone.  The new phone even came with a carrying case for my belt.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Recieved more than ever expected!", "Author": "Arysta Argabright", "ReviewID": "R216ZI0KC553YE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a pleasant surprise to have received this, let alone any package ordered online, and be completely satisfied. It said fair condition- meaning heavy wear from normal use- and I would have to say it was much better than fair! Barely any blemish on the screen, no physical damage or wear on housing of phone. Battery cover was not broken or worn at all and battery holds a long charge as desired. I am completely satisfied with this purchase and seller and would recommend to everyone.Thanks,your happy customer!", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "Cellular Dealer", "ReviewID": "R1OV6YYBGND4A2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this item as a spare phone, end up using this a lot.

Next there is too much navigation with this phone, you have to click for everything, even when you hang up, you have to push \"end\" for the call to end.

That is stupid but the phone seems to work ok and it holds up well. It has a head phone jack and works well with bluetooth headsets.
