It is the best option for those people that do not want to pay for a data plan and still have a nice phone. For the fancier phones, Sprint makes you get a data plan.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid little phone", "Author": "the Lorax", "ReviewID": "R3BZO3FKBDNALB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pro's:Very small. Will fit comfortably in the smallest of pocketsKeyboard works well. Very little typos madeThe user interface is simple and intuitiveBattery life is pretty goodCon's:Its not a smart phone. Poor choice of apps/games, and sub standard web surfingMany people report having issues with it. The only issue with mine is that it randomly calls my girlfriend. Weird I know. Thats why I took off a starCamera quality is poor, even for cell phone standards.If you are trying to use this like a smartphone, you will be disappointed.If you just use it for the basics; making calls, texting, using the calendar/alarm, then you will be happy with it.I also usually carry an iPod touch with me for using apps, games, taking photos, and other things. Between these two devices, I can do almost everything a smartphone can do (minus 3g internet), without having to pay for an expensive data plan.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "small", "Author": "tech mom", "ReviewID": "R2JWLUDNFNU5U9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like the small size and the texting keyboard, but the phone does not last long for teens.

There's nothing fancy about it. It has a good keyboard, it works and feels like a phone should. I like the calendar/alarms.I bought mine for 40 bucks, a used one online - please don't pay $200 for this. Buy something nice for a loved one with the extra $150. :)", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awful", "Author": "gnk \"gnk\"", "ReviewID": "R3CKD4DFZGMPOO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Great at accidentally dialing previously called numbers, since the keyboard moving even a fraction of an inch cancels the keyboard lock.
