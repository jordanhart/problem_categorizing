He had one that got smashed by a truck running over it.  Before it got smashed, the grandson left it outside in West Virginia.  For several months.  After it was dried, it worked just fine.  This is a talk and text phone that I think is perfect for young people.  It is rugged and can take abuse.  The battery lasts a reasonable amount of time.  It has served my grandson very well.  I would certainly recommend this phone to anyone.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waste of Money", "Author": "Becca", "ReviewID": "R1NOLV85LK9NCR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'd only had this phone for a few months when it became impossible to hold a normal conversation because with nearly every call, the other person would complain about my voice cutting out and becoming extremely muffled and faint. On top of that, the phone kept dropping calls left and right (in areas of my home and neighborhood where previous phones had no problem whatsoever). Both of these problems got worse over time. Figuring the phone was defective, I sent it in to Verizon and they gave me a replacement (same model). The new one started okay but quickly developed the same problems, which only grew worse and worse over the next few months. Conclusion: this is a crappy phone and not worth your money.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is better than buying a new cell phone", "Author": "cooztinye", "ReviewID": "R2EYXPFT3WTX2Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you have a need for a replacement phone, and just need basic talk and text capabilities, this is a great phone for you!", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Julie", "ReviewID": "R1Z63GBSF2J9PK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great phone.

However, I haven't, and up until three months ago, this ol' girl had been my telecommunication source for three years.I like to ramble, so let's get the basic summaries out of the way first.PRO'S:>Damn near indestructible>Great reception in most mountain-y parts of the western U.S./outdoor places/etc>Love the QWERTY board.>Camera quality not bad for tiny phone.>Very reliable.>Good quality sound. Speakerphone worked reasonably well.CON'S>Did not appear to enjoy making calls in basements or underground areas.>A bit slower as the years progressed>Miserable internal memory.>Tiny screen meant that I couldn't enjoy some of the photos I took myself on the phone or received from others.SUMMATION: At its heart, this old girl did what a phone was meant to do back in the day: take and make reliable calls, text quickly and efficiently and survive all the abuse you could throw at it. I could wax poetic about this little phone. It was not of regal blood like an iPhone or Droid, but it served its purpose reliably for over three years. In my book, that's not half bad. If you want a basic phone with no heartache, and love the wonder of texting with QWERTY, LG Cosmos is a great, inexpensive option.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "A saving grace!", "Author": "suzanne", "ReviewID": "R1EA3YE038SJNE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband likes this phone and put his through the wash cycle.
