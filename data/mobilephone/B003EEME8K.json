As a person who just dislike smart phone, I still like a cellphone that is sleek and stylish. And, after a year of search, I finally found exactly what I was looking for. I used this phone for several months, it worked just great. It worked perfectly fine with AT&T; service, and the cellphone surely made AT&T;'s flip cell phone selection look really dull, not-stylish, and plain-ugly. Also, one thing that I found funny is that, I can record anything with the phone and use it as ring tone or notice. I recorded my wife's voice for text message notice. So, whenever I receive text, I laughed out loud. I highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Basic Flip Phone With Some Issues", "Author": "to0pink", "ReviewID": "R3JVUTUPCG4TP9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall this is a great flip phone. It is sleek and gets the job done for making phone calls.PROS:-Sleek-Very customizable interface-good quality for phone calls-strong battery life (not sure what the other reviewer had wrong with his phone)CONS:-It does NOT have a outside display for caller ID. You must open the phone to look at who is calling-The dialpad sometimes will not pick up a button press. Minor issue, but still a sloppy issue that should have been fixed-As always with samsung phones, I do not enjoy their use of the calendar system. it is not easy to set a quick reminder as you have to input lots of information just to set a reminder for yourselfOverall good flip phone if you're looking for the basic phone.

My Nokia has a battery that lasts up to a week between charges. This phone has to be charged every 24 hours if not used, more if you actually want to use it for something other than looking cool.

Quick, easy to set up, large key pad numbers, easy to use.I will be using the Apple iPhone 5 but wife wanted a plain flip phone to take the place of a Nokia \"candy bar\" style she had been using for a year or so. She prefers a pre-paid account and never uses up the 400 minutes a year you get with the $100.00 pre-pay with AT&T.; Number of functions... can be obtained from the description.Only issue was trying to get the back off so I could insert the SIM card.

The one thing that I did not like is that there is no way to see the time or who is calling without opening up the phone, which I find inconvenient. (This could be due to the fact that my last one was that way.)  Overall, it is good, but it is just an average-type phone, nothing too exciting. But that was what I was looking for.  I think the price is a bit high for what you get, though.I don't remember reading it would need a converter for outlets in the states.  Don't like needing an extra piece.  Also the language selections are very limited, only english and a few Asian countries.  No spanish.The back comes off very easily.

No problems charging or transferring my SIM card. I like the fact that the micro SD card slips in the side. The \" free phone \" had to be opened to put SD card under the battery where the SIM card was.

It has a toolbar to put your frequently used icons - messsages, camera, internet etc. This allows instant access.It has bluetooth but no infrared connectivity.The only design fault is the charger. The plug is made for some European outlets. An adapter comes with it. It doesn't connect to the charger properly.

Igo", "ReviewID": "RHTFWD6ZQ9P7Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a replacement for my Motorola flip that took a crash and broke a hinge.  I never liked the speaker on it. but  maybe others had better luck.  This one is hands down a better quality speaker.  But I wanted to get my old ringtone back (wizards in winter) and I had already rid myself of the other phone.  My nephew in MO. told me to go to Samsung's website and download the Kies program and it will show how it's done.  He also e-mailed the mp3 ringtone as an attachment.  Well, I failed at this job.  And got some terrible results, including the dreaded 'blue screen'.  I suspect some compatibility issues.  Anyhow, this phone is a great instrument.  It is a little slippery though.  So I put on a couple of those \"tacky\" rubber skin things and problem solved (for me).  And because this doesn't have a screen on the flip, which I don't need, I could put the skins on both sides.  Very nice and more secure for my big mitts.  I'm happy with it.Addendum:  The Kies program doesn't work with this phone.  It's designed for their 'smart' phones.  Dang!  But a geek friend put me on a different program called Samsung New PC Studio.  It loaded all 4 ringtones into the 'music' room.  But now, it appears it doesn't recognize them and won't play any of them as a ringtone.  I've pushed a lot of buttons and no-go.  Rereading the manual for this feature leads me to believe it doesn't have this capability.  Why not?  My Motorola did it just fine.  So if any of you out there have the \"trick\" for doing this, I would sure like to hear it.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "SAMSUNG 3600i", "Author": "SATISFIED", "ReviewID": "RVH9RQRM0HRZ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product meets with my expectations.
