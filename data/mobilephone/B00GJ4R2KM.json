The back is so thin that it will break when you try to open it to install a battery or a sim card. The SD does not work, it slips in but does not register. The touch screen works only sometimes. The camera does work well when you can get it to work. The phone freezes up and you have to restart it to get it to work again. I do not recommend this to anyone.This is the second one I have gotten. The first on was sent back and I bought another one. Both were cheap and do not work.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bad phone all arount...", "Author": "Anthony", "ReviewID": "R495XN7ZTBH9L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to get the unlock status of it and when it arrived it would not power on. I got it to power on once, but after that it would not stay on unless on the charger with the back cover removed, once I put the cover on it would shut off every time.
