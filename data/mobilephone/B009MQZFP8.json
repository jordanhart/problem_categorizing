{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Here's the deal with this phone...", "Author": "dowza13", "ReviewID": "R3PLQKE5IMUY57", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picked one up for $335, so this review probably applies to the phones in the sub 400 price range. Also there are several vendors,  got mine from Hassel Free Cellphones or something... Yes, the phone is new in the box. No,it is not \"brand new\" or unopened. Yes, the phone comes unlocked, that is why the box is opened so they can program the unlock code. No, the phone is not in Chinese, it's in English and works fine. Yes, the phone comes with all accessories plus an adapter for the U.S. outlets. Yes, it is the LT30p model...some vendors sell the LT30at model, just make sure you pick the right one. Yes, it works with TMobile and gets 3g data speed just fine and has no problems reading the TMobile micro sim cards...just pop it in and you're ready to go in less than a minute. No, the phone was not scratched up or cracked...it was new. Phone works great so far and like it much more than my Nexus 4, which is as fragile as a wine glass and shattered from a two foot drop. It also has a large enough screen without feeling like a phone book in your hands. No idea if Sony would honor the warranty but doubt they would...hopefully will never need to find out, but in my 13 years of owning  cell phone, I never had to warranty one.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "Roger D Clark", "ReviewID": "RABI9IAIOCGA2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone free at best buy for an upgrade, and I am happy with it.I have also dropped this phone many times and it has not broken due to the tiny lip around the screen. On the iPhone 4 and 4s the screen sticks out!Pros:excellent screenfairly speedyThe music player is fine(I use it to play WMA audio).the camera is amazingCons:battery lifebutton placement", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great performance and build quality for the price", "Author": "Lex", "ReviewID": "R30D64GRKYPS6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone for a little over 300 dollars and the more I use it the more I like it.Note: I ordered mine from HassleFreeCell and it was a brand new LT30p as advertised.===Software===I can't comment on the stock software since I almost immediately started flashing custom ROMs (highly recommended, not as dangerous as you might think). As far as that goes, the latest cyanogen mod is officially supported, and there's a great variety of other ROMs on XDA (I prefer PAC-man). I played around with the BRAVIA engine a bit before I flashed it away, and I wasn't too impressed. It pretty much just ups the contrast.===Color/Material/Build/Style===I got the black, which I'm very happy with. I haven't seen the white in person, but judging from the material used for the cover I'm thinking it would not look very good (much like an oreo cookie). The cover does not really inhibit fingerprints as claimed, but that's not a big deal for me. It gets cleaned off every time I put it in my pocket (along with the screen). It's a solid feeling phone and I very much like the silver accents for the buttons and around the headphone jack and camera. Unfortunately this was one of the last models before Sony started making the power button larger and more eye-catching. I noticed that the positioning of the buttons has gotten some negative press, but I actually prefer it. I don't exactly have small hands, but reaching all the way up on the phone when you're holding it from the bottom (supported with pinky) would be difficult. Sony made a good choice here.===Connectivity===***Supports Wimax (T-mobile 4G) up to 42 Mbps (if you can get it). This seems to be the fastest 4G support before needing LTE.***WiDi AKA Miracast is officially supported! The introduction of Chromecast kind of diminishes this, but it's still a great feature to have in my opinion. I look forward to trying it out when I get a WiDi box for my TV.***DLNA is also supported, can't comment, haven't tried it.***Has an FM Radio which is nice to see (although I probably won't use it).***GLONASS GPS! This is the russian GPS system which can be used to compliment the USA's GPS. What this means to you is almost instant GPS locks (outdoors). I'm very impressed with this.***It has NFC which is more useful than many people realize. Aside from exchanging info between phones, you can buy cheap NFC tags for home/work/car1/car2 that allow the phone to change various settings as soon as you touch the tag. Note: screen must be on for NFC to activate.===Screen===The size is about right I think. You really don't want a screen that's too big if you prefer using one hand, and 4.55\" is kind of pushing it. I find it acceptable though. The 720p 323ppi resolution is marvelous. I've done some comparison between this phone (regular TFT), an LG phone that I returned (IPS), and my old phone (AMOLED). My impression is as follows:***Screen hue in direct light: IPS (worst) < AMOLED < TFT (best)***Contrast with screen on: IPS (worst) < TFT < AMOLED (best by far)***Color vibrance: TFT (worst) < AMOLED < IPS (only slightly better than OLED)***Viewing angle: TFT (worst) < AMOLED, IPS (equal)Regardless of the color vibrance and viewing angle not being quite as good, I hardly ever try to view it from an angle where you can notice and the colors still look great to me. IPS was actually the most dissapointing in terms of eye-candy.===Battery===The battery is not removable, but this isn't actually a huge deal for me. I've never bought an aftermarket battery for any phone I've ever had. You can still force the phone to turn off by holding volume-up and power. 1850 mAh seems a little low compared to other high end phones, but I really think the software makes the most difference. Invest in Better Battery Stats to figure out which apps and services are draining your battery. Even with moderate usage every day I end up with a nice chunk of battery left when I got to bed. If you spend a couple hours on youtube you'll probably need to charge it sooner.===Camera===If you want to just count megapixels, 13 is pretty high for android phones these days. I'm personally more impressed with the dedicated shutter button and LED flash. Also, the 1.2 Mp front camera is a noteworthy improvement over VGA.===Performance===The biggest thing for me here is the 1GB RAM. If you're coming from a phone with 512MB this is going to make for *huge* reduction in lag. The CPU is also very powerful. It uses a snapdragon S4, which is top of the line in performance/Hz (as of writing this). As in the case with PCs, don't be fooled into just focusing on MHz or buying a quad core with less single thread performance. For reference, some other phones with the same CPU/GPU combo:***HTC One S/XL/X-AT&T;***Samsung Galaxy S3 (NA version)***LG Spectrum II 4G***Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1===Storage===I didn't really think I would appreciate the 16GB of internal storage since I already have a 32GB SD card, but it comes in very handy. It makes loading a bunch of ROMS at once very convenient without having to find space on your external SD. Also, android likes to clutter up your main storage card, so I can still keep my external SD clutter free and packed with even more music. Don't worry about fidling with \"USB storage mode\" or anything to transfer files on/off the internal or external card either. I think it uses MTP, so you plug it in and it just shows up in \"My Computer\".===Random cons===***Micro-SIM. Probably because it has to be inserted from the side. I have a feeling various sim card sizes are going start becoming the norm over the standard mini-SIM. I've invested in a nano-SIM punch cutter ($10).***The bluetooth/headphone volume is a bit low compared to my last phone (galaxy s 4g). This phone tends to get complaints about low volume in general.***The notification light is so dim it's basically useless. It's multi-colored though for what that's worth.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Close But Not What I Expected", "Author": "sdallen", "ReviewID": "RCE1BVY7X9CQ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone mainly because it was listed as unlocked and, because I use T-Mobile, it would give me 3G service on T-Mobiles 1700 band.The phone that arrived was not an LT30P as advertised, what I received was a model LT30AT which is the AT&T; model. This is good and bad: The good thing is that the phone I got supports 4G and LTE service on the AT&T; network. The bad news is that on my existing T-Mobile account I can only get Edge or 2G service...a huge difference.The fact that I could not access the 3G network on T-Mobile indicates this phone was not unlocked (I confirmed this with AT&T; by checking the IMEI code). The phone also arrived in an AT&T; box with only the phone, charger and quick start guide, no other accessories.I decided to keep the phone and switch my plan from T-Mobile to AT&T;, that is how much I like this phone but yes it is a hassle switching companies.I understand that the seller may have needed to substitute the AT model for the P model and in fact that is an upgrade IF the replacement is unlocked and ideally if the buyer is made aware of the change before receiving the item. That never happened.I gave the phone a 4 Star rating because it is truly a great phone. The upgrade to Jellybean (4.1 from 4.0) was a no brainer as the notification appeared on the phone as soon as I turned it on. Coming from a windows 7.8 phone I find this phone to be very fast and the fact you can put up to a 32GB memory card in it is a huge plus when most phones nowadays don't have an sd slot.The only thing I would advise is to contact the seller prior to ordering and confirm the model you will receive.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Yunlin Hsu", "ReviewID": "R16S9SI3M5BRQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prior to getting this phone, I had a Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, so this was a pretty big upgrade for me.Looking at the discussions for this phone after I ordered it, I was afraid that I would be getting the LT30at but thankfully what came in the mail was a LT30p as advertised.  Just a heads-up, the adapter that I got was a UK one, so I had to order another one, although you can just charge the phone with the USB cable that is included. Also, the phone uses a microsim card. It also came with a screen protector.  The phone is beautifully designed. There is a slight curve in the back which makes it easier to hold, although it's already rubber on the back, which is really comfortable. Putting in the SIM card was somewhat of a pain, as it wouldn't register the first few times I put it in. I'd advise you to just keep it in and not fiddle with it once the phone registers it. I haven't added a microSD card yet, but the ability to do so is also a plus.  The display is really nice, but I was able to pick out individual pixels in the dark when I went to settings. Normally you wouldn't notice them, though. It's also really easy to see the display even in the sun.  I've had the phone for two weeks and I've noticed some lag when I turn on the phone in the loading of the weather widget as well as album pictures on the left and right home screens, respectively. Also, the phone started to lag pretty badly once I downloaded a game from the Play store and started playing it. It sometimes took a few seconds for the phone to wake up after I pressed the power button. So I uninstalled the app and factory reset the phone. I felt rather disappointed although to be honest I was playing for a few hours and the screen got pretty hot. My phone is back to normal after the reset, although the turn-on lag still persists.  The battery on the phone is acceptable. It usually doesn't drop below 80% and I charge it every day. If you play a lot of games, though, it will die pretty quickly. You can enable stamina mode in the settings, which will turn off wifi use when the screen is off. I don't know how much of an impact it makes, but at least you have the option.  Checking email on the phone is really easy. If you have a Gmail account, the phone will automatically check for email and will notify you when you have new mail. Even if you don't the email app is easy to set up and it's really quick to check for new mail from there.  The camera is great and I don't have any complaints. If you want to use the sleep to snap to take pictures quickly from the lock screen, you need to set that option in the camera settings. The focus is a little off when you do that, but it's doesn't make a huge difference.  Another thing I like about the phone is that you can change its language to almost anything and you can input text in a lot of different languages as well. To change the input language you need to change the keyboard, which is separate from the language of the phone.  I use my phone to play music sometimes, and the sound is pretty nice. It doesn't really drain the battery very much as well, if you keep the screen off. Speaking of the sound, one thing I didn't know at first was that the alarm won't go off if your phone isn't on. I don't really like to keep my phone on all night, so this was rather annoying.Here's a summary of the pros and cons I found:Pros:- fast in general- great camera- very clear display- aesthetically pleasingCons:- gets laggy with certain apps/screen gets hot- lowers quality of photos you uploadOverall, I'm pretty satisfied with the phone. It does what I need it to do well, is really fast overall, and has an appealing design with a great camera. I still wish there was less lag when it turned on, but it doesn't make a big difference in the long run.Edit May 11, 2013: Lowered quality when uploading is not the phone's fault.

The screen is gorgeous: text is sharp and colours are brilliant, mind you, not as brilliant as AMOLED displays but excellent all the same; viewing angles aren't as good, but it only matters when you're not looking at your phone dead on when you use it, which in my case is very rare. Performance is snappy and so far I haven't run into any lag (I don't play games so take that into consideration). I absolutely love the design and like it better than my sister's Galaxy S3 as it makes the phone feel sturdier in the hand and can be used one-handed, button placement is a bit unusual but you quickly get the hang of it.So far, the only drawback has been battery life as I'm getting something around 24H on a charge with wifi on constantly, 30 mins of music playback and 3h of browsing. Hopefully after a while battery behaviour will stabilize and I'll get a little more usage from the phone.With regards to de seller (in my case Hasslefree Cell) they were excellent, the phone arrived quickly and, as promised, was the International Edition. They were very helpful when asked any questions about the product and,since the model came with an UK standard charger, they threw in an adapter for American power sockets.

Depending on which country you're in, you might pick it up as the Xperia GX, or possibly even the TX. The final review sample that's been passed our desk, however, is the Xperia T, the European HSPA version, headed to O2's UK stores in the coming weeks, at which point it will be free on \u00a336 per-month contracts and likely replace the Xperia S as Sony's Android flagship. In comparison to Sony's spring smartphone, there's a similar 720p display, now stretched out to 4.6 inches, a different 13-megapixel camera, a new 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 processor and Android ICS -- with the promise of Jelly Bean soon after it hits store. The Xperia T also revives a familiar hardware curve and has picked up onscreen Android buttons on its design journey. Design twists and promises of the latest OS aside, has Sony finally built a top-tier phone capable of going toe-to-toe with the smartphone heavyweights?

I chose sony because ,a that time I did not like the other choices, and I think they had an awesome camera. the first thing I notice is that , when you are driving, it is hard to hear the conversation, ( poor amplification)even with my volume turned up fully. after a year and a half, while still in a two year contract, the microphone started acting up, when making a phone call, the other cannot hear a word that I'm saying, as if the phone is in mute. I called Sony, they had me hard reset the phone,its works for half a day and quit again. Sony rep claimed that it seems like a software issue, that I have it repaired. since its out of warranty, I have to pay for it myself.My take on this is that, If a phones can not last the life of your contract, its not worth buying at all. Since most manufacturer uses pretty the same software on multiple model, I would advise anyone against buying a Sony phone. its not worth wasting your money on them", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent choice.

At least to my expectations and needs.I live in Ecuador , and although Sony is just entering the market with Xperia smartphones , I had no major difficulties in configuring it with my cell phone operator.Objectively I can say.PROS :- Very fluid interface . (Less saturated than the Samsung Galaxy )- Very good processor speed.- Excellent resolution of the camera.- Good sound volume- The screen resolution is excellent .- Nice design team .- Perfect size ( not too big or small) . For me it is ergonomic. Good point for Sony .CONS :- The camera does not perform as well in low light , though flash . ( But you have to accept that even the average smarthphones are not able to match to a camera in this respect) .- The battery life is acceptable in my case , since I use it to browse and chat moderately ( also use another phone to my work) . If you use it hard to navigate or play could take a disappointment.- Like most Android smarthphones come pre installed with many apps that are useless . Many can delete later.Summary: Great phone Sony.
