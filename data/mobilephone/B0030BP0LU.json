In that phone contained pictures of my lovely little furry angel, my kitten, who passed away at 6 months old, and TEXT MESSAGES with VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION :). I recently found out that the adapter for the charger broke, and it might not be fixable, and if it could be fixed, it would be quite pricey. Another thought was to simply order a replacement battery, but I needed a charging source for it, hence the phone. Turns out I just happened to drop my other, working phone in the toilet shortly after this was sent, and what a miracle it was to have a back-up phone to use until my new phone from my service company was shipped to me! I just simply had to activate another account and just prepay for enough minutes to get me buy until the new phone arrived. It was odd going back to a phone of simpler times, but I got used to it quite quickly and atually liked it. I have to say, my high tech new phone at times does not seem as easy to use as this one, and I do still use this spare phone today for that reason, as it does have prepaid minutes left. Thus, great phone in good shape, came with a battery so I didn't even really need to order spares, and works just as new. Only odd thing which might be from the service company is I keep getting texts saying a credit card of mine is being charged...but it is a different phone number, so I think that must be the service company. Made a good replacement and back-up phone and I would recommened as that, or, recommend as a phone if one just wants to mae calls and text only and prefers simpler times :).", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG vx5500 cell phone", "Author": "Rat4444 \"clear thinker\"", "ReviewID": "R1NJCCHRVB6QDB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I gave 5500 four stars, based on it being a simple prepaid phone.
