It is not a smart phone, but it works very well for what it is. The battery leaves something to be desired, but you can pick up an extra for about $5 so that's not really a big deal for me at all. Why did I give it four stars tho? Because you can use it to tether. I have the $50 a month unlimited prepaid plan from AT&T; and so far I have been able to use the tethered connection perfectly well. It's only 3g speeds so it's nothing exceptional, but it's certainly useful. If you want a cheap way to tether, you should consider this phone.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bought in july-2012", "Author": "smart man", "ReviewID": "R27V29GF39DMQ0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This  product does not last for long duration, within 1.5 years this product stopped working, though  it was used in good manner.Better not to choose this stuff.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG", "Author": "Noles", "ReviewID": "R3KU9T08MNYXG3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this device from AT&T; for a replacement for the RAZR.
