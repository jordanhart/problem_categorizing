The Commando is the perfect phone for the outdoor types where you don't have to worry about dropping the phone or getting it wet.  Even though it's milspec, the phone is no heavier than other smart phones we've owned.  Our son has the older, 3G version that has gone through the laundry at college more than once without any problems whatsoever. Highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Basically Unreliable", "Author": "Mind Control", "ReviewID": "R2328Y4765REJ5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone I upgraded from: Droid X2The phone I traded this in for after the camera just stopped working: Droid RazrMIf you do some research about this phone you will find mixed reviews across the internet from the forums, the verizon website, and now Amazon! Also the product website is, pretty intense... I wasn't impressed. If you aren't terribly picky and you like this phone's style try it out, that's what I did. I wasn't thrilled with the fact it was an older version of android OS and the Casio stuff that comes with is more kitschy than it is useful. After having it for three days I was going to keep it for the durability and it wasn't a terrible phone, but then the camera just stopped working. No drops, no roots, just normal use it went kaput. So after doing more research it seemed like the people who really liked the phone had reprogramed it, since I'm not into that sort of thing I decided to exchange the Commando 4G for the Razr M.I wouldn't say its a bad phone, but I was very unfamiliar with the way it was set up because of the extra G'z apps. The calls sounded good, and there are front facing speakers so the external audio is real good. The screen is on the smaller side and there are numerous people who have cracked their screens already. The people who appeared to really get the most out of this phone are the ones who could re-program(rooting) it, and I'm not interested in that. I think as of today three months after the debut of this device that has a MSRP of $450. Verizon is giving this phone away right now, think about that. Realistically I would recommend a more popular phone or a brand of device you preferred with the most rugged case available most are water resistant(and a dry bag if waterproof is a must) instead of the G'zone.Bottom line: Wanted to like it, but was a little wary when the camera on this \"rugged\" phone was a lemon. So I returned it, did what I recommend and I'm pleased so far.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R2MT5FMEXHMJQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone if you are looking for ruggedness.  I had been using my wife's old Droid 2 until my contract was up.  I dropped it one night, battery flew out, and the phone, of course, fell in a puddle.  Thing was junk after that, apparently I knocked the antenna loose, so it functioned but wouldn't get any signal.  My dad had the 3G version and is pretty rough on it, he has had no problems whatsoever.  So I purchased another Droid 2 on Ebay to get me through until this phone FINALLY came out.  I think I got it a day or two after it was released.  I like  to wait a few months before I review anything.  This phone has been fantastic.  It has locked up once or twice, usually when I hadn't rebooted it in a while and had done several app updates.  I think that is a problem you'll have with about any smartphone.  It does not have the greatest specs, but for the normal web browser and occaisional game player, it works just fine for me.  I have dropped it numerous times, usually in a parking lot onto concrete/asphalt, with out any problems resulting from the drops.  Pretty good battery life, but I am not a heavy user.  There is an extended battery for it, $50 from Verizon.  I know you can get an otterbox for other phones, but it just makes it bigger and more bulky than most phones are already.  You won't need any such case for this phone while recieving the same level of protection.  Camera is pretty good, I was fairly impressed actually.  (Hint:  This goes for any phone's camera, if you scratch the lens and your pictures are coming out blurry or hazy, get some DVD/CD repair and use that, worked miracles on the camera lens on my phone). All in all, I have no complaints about this phone and would recommend it to anyone who is hard on there phones.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great durable phone", "Author": "Debbie Kirchoffner", "ReviewID": "R299EDCQUEKKLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice phone for a hard working man!

I had the C771 for two years and it still works, too (albeit it is very slow).The G'Zone 4G LTE here has be greatly improved from it's predecessor. Still just as rugged and tough, but a lot sleeker.  Both myself and my husband each have this model and have yet to have any issues with durability.  He is in law enforcement and has jumped into rivers with it, rolled in the mud with it, etc and there isn't even a scratch!As for myself, I am SUPER clumsy and break phones just by looking cross-eyed at them, and I can't break this (or the older model for that matter).  Mine has been dropped on concrete, tile, asphalt, and every other place known to man and mine still looks new.  Mind you, all this WITHOUT any protective cases!  These are the only phones we've ever owned that did NOT need Otterboxes or other waterproof cases.I will admit, that the features on this phone aren't as hi-tech as an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, but the trade-off is minimal when you're not having to replace/replace the phone every few months because of damage.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "CASIO G\u2019zOne Commando\u00ae 4G LTE", "Author": "Martin L.

The charging port came open or was not closed all the way prior to the wash. I could not get it to recover even after the bag of rice for 3+ days or out in the sun on a hot dry day. Boots up quickly enough, sincs into my car Bluetooth quickly. I downloaded my iTunes via MP3 and it plays music wirelessly in my car via Bluetooth.

I am VERY disappointed with this phone (my first smart-phone). I have returned to the Verizon Wireless store three times to complain about the constant \"lock-ups\". The responses has been the same each time; \" yeah, they do that... just take the battery out for a second or two and then it will be fine\".  REALLY !??  That's what I need to do with my brand new phone !??  TWO or THREE times a day, really !?!?!? It sounds like defective design or equipment to me, and yet I'm told to just deal with it....  The phone will drop a phone call if a text message comes in while you are talking.  If this is so \"normal\" for this phone they should have a reset button on the case like my old PC.  In one month of ownership, I've almost worn out the rear-cover locking tab.UPDATE: >>>  The phone now shuts off and restarts (reboots) automatically, even when fully charged, just sitting there on the table...

It was great, very durable, survived all the demands placed on it.  He loved it.  Then he 'upgraded' to the new phone.  It lasted 7 whole days before it shattered.  Verizon would do nothing to fix the problem.  So basically it cost over $20 a day for the week and had to be replaced, burning through another upgrade.

Boots up really fast, display is beautiful and a little larger then the old model. As a side note, every cell phone I've ever had has been glitchy.

The 4g Lte really makes a difference compared to the old model with the 3g service. My only complaint is with all cell phones being loaded up with apps from service providers that I never use.
