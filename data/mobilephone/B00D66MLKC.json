Application is easy so long as you place the button side into the case first. The corners of he device seem relatively safe from impacts. Should the device fall on its face; however, the seems to be very little \"lip\" on this case to protect it.

But I still thought I would hate having my sleek, metallic Lumia 925 covered in plastic. I was pleasantly surprised.This case not only does what I hoped it would do -- reinforce the vulnerable corners and recess the camera lens so it doesn't get scratched when I lay the phone down -- it actually feels good in the hand. Smooth and kind of creamy, and a little less slippery (read droppable) than the naked phone. As other reviewers have noted, the buttons, lenses, and various orifices are easily accessible. The case adds only about a millimeter of thickness. And it leaves enough of the 925's beautiful aluminum rim exposed to remind you of the high-quality instrument beneath the cover.Finally, if you're into color, the solid purple goes great with many of the Windows Phone 8 color themes -- olive, violet, mauve, orange, yellow, green, taupe, and others.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "I would not buy this case because it breaks easily.", "Author": "Layla Young", "ReviewID": "R17QY4INSXFA0E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very disappointed in this case.

Anyone who's picked up the phone off a table knows that the metal edges are pretty slick.  Many times picking up the phone means accidentally hitting the power button or volume rocker.  This case has enough texture to grip it well without being too grippy to slip into a pocket.With the protruding lens on the back of the case, I worried that the lens cover would get eventually scratched up from setting the phone down throughout the day.  This case keeps the lens bubble from ever making contact with the surface the phone is sitting on.Overall, it's a nice, slim case that doesn't add any notable bulk to the phone, doesn't get in the way of any buttons or ports, and adds a little extra protection to the device.

It's also not too grippy that is can't slide into my pants pocket, but keeps it from sliding out of my hand too easily like it does without a case (the phone is slick/slippery for me).The downside to this case is that, since it is hard, it cracks eventually.  I've had mine for about half a year and the case is slowly starting to split from the corner down the side.  I've dropped the phone a few times with it on, and another corner has cracked and chipped off as a result.

The cover is a coated hard plastic, not TPU gel.  It is the thinnest and \"cleanest\" looking of the cases I tried.  The corners are protected by the case but barely.  Thicker TPU cases provide better protection on the corners.  I prefer cases like this one where the buttons are not covered by the case.

First and foremost, after owning it less than a month, one of the corners broke off the phone. It's the top right corner, which is typically the corner that goes into the jeans pocket first, so it gets a little more wear and tear than the other corners, but it literally just broke off.The second problem is that while I agree with every other review here in that it is a very, very slim and attractive case, it affords no protection to the phone whatsoever. I dropped the phone from no more than 3 feet last night and it landed on the two non-broken corners. My Lumia now sports a shattered screen all across the bottom right of the phone.So if you want a slick, thin case for your phone, this is the case to buy.

It will give it minimal fall coverage, but IMO not the best.  Will seek out another cover when I have the money.  The cover is good if you like to really grip your phone when you hold it.  If you just lightly hold it at an angle there is a chance it will slide out of hand.  I do see what other people mean by the plastic piece that juts out because it over flowed in the mold.

This is meant to prevent daily \"gentle abuse\" to the phone, such as setting it on dirty surfaces, taking it in and out of pockets, keeping it clean from your oily fingers (we all have oily fingers, don't deny it). It covers the phone and protects it from average, everyday use.Second, I give this case 5 stars because I don't abuse my phone. I don't drop it frequently. I don't carry it to jobs such as construction work. I don't have pets or friends that chew on it. It keeps my phone covered so that I worry less about it getting dirty, scratched, or wet (from the rain, not the ocean). It is light enough I don't notice it when I'm carrying the phone, stylish enough I don't consider it to look tacky, and provides direct and unrestricted access to the main buttons and ports; I hate cases that obstruct the main buttons and ports such that it requires you to bench a certain minimum weight to use them.Lastly, this is a back (and sides) cover only - no screen protection. Personally, I don't mind that. I love this case just the way it is and it fits my lifestyle and usage scenario perfectly. Oh, one last note: this does have an issue with lasting quality.

That said, for $5, I wasn't expecting it to be that protective.My only real complaint, however, is the bottom edge.
