When troubleshooting I was told to download the Network app from the Nokia Marketplace but the app is not there.  And there are no other options for the MMS.  The Samsung Windows phone is much easier to use.  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.  It was a Christmas present and that is VERY disappointing.  I will be using it for a paper weight.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Returned", "Author": "Sarax", "ReviewID": "R3T0KH8JSJ13BL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I returned this item because I ordered the wrong one (I was unaware of the size of SIM card required) and I truly was excited when I received a nice brand new box for this phone. Of course, I couldn't open it, but since it was packaged firmly I believe the phone would have been in perfect condition. They were courteous and allowed me to return it for a full refund. I will be happy to order the correct phone from them when I get the chance!", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008A1UY6G"}}
