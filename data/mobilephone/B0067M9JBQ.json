{"Reviews": [{"Title": "As a T-Mobile user, this phone is worth losing 3G.", "Author": "Andy Dopieralski", "ReviewID": "R1CR8M1PRXPCWS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Lumia 800 as a replacement for a dead HD7. I was honestly just about done with the Windows Mobile platform due to the poor experience I had with the HTC. I'm really glad I pulled the trigger on this phone. First, on T-Mobile you will lose 3G. The radio only supports AT&T;'s 3G band in the US. It does have support for T-Mobile's 4G frequency, but I doubt the radio supports 4G and currently the OS doesn't either, natively. So don't hold out hope for a ton of data streaming to this thing. That being said, I really am noticing how little data I actually use. Yeah, Netflix isn't great over Edge, but the phone's great WiFi radio has worked for every hotspot I've tried. My HD7 failed to connect to WiFi about 50% of the time, so this is a huge win for the Nokia.Battery life on the phone is much better than people are saying. Part is likely due to the fact that I am not using 3G, but part is owed to a bug in battery reporting in Nokia's software. So you will see lower battery than your phone really has, but the phone will still have plenty. I have done a full two day run without a charge and a couple of heavy Doodle God sessions were had.I am also not seeing any issue with the camera. In fact, the photos are much more vibrant and clear than my cousin's Focus (v1, mind you). And compared to the HD7 - which was like punishment for trying to take photos on a phone - it might as well be a DSLR. The Zeiss glass is clear and the focus is solid. Nokia doesn't pack in all of the bells and whistles in terms of camera options, but the default ones from the OS aren't horrible.GPS has been stellar. Great locks, great accuracy...Glympse is a dream to use. Like other customers have said, go with the Nokia GPS for turn by turn.The curved glass and solid body design make the phone feel really great in hand. Not cheap in the least. The phone feels solid and comfortable. The supplied gel skin case is a nice bonus and looks very good without adding much thickness at all.Pros:Design qualityBattery life (actual)FastBeautiful screen/deep blacksCall quality is excellentGreat wifi radioFast camera button responseCons:No T-Mobile band (not really a big deal, honestly)Battery indicator is incorrectThe charging port is under a weird door AND is on top of the phone, making using it while plugged in a hasslePentile Matrix (this is a con to some people, I guess. But it looks great to me)Phone will likely kill you if placed in that box from Transformers by John Turturro.Over all, a hard 5 stars. I love my phone again.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stunning product. (Perfect after 11501 update!)", "Author": "Linh Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R3VYRUTCHGYGG3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE #3: I just realized I completely forgot to mention certain carrier info. I'm using the phone with AT&T; in NYC. Doesn't work with their HSPA+ (yet? I believe there will be a way to enable the frequency) as far as I can tell but I get 3mbit downstream and 1mbit upstream, which is a-OK.UPDATE #2: Flashed the new 11501 firmware. Battery problem be gone! I unplugged my phone at around 1AM and left it idling. It's now 330PM and battery still at 58% with normal use from 9AM. Great job Nokia. I haven't noticed anything else other than the battery fix though. Added the last star :)-------------------------------------------------------You can love or hate Windows Phone OS, but you have to admit, Nokia sure stepped up their game in designing this beauty.HARDWARE:\"Borrowed\" heavily from its N9 sibling, this is one stunning phone to look at. Poly-carbonate body means very scratch resistant and none of that slippery glass surface, unlike a certain smartphone. The curves also make it very comfortable to hold, especially over a long period of time, also unlike a certain square-ish phone. Speaker and microphone neatly at the bottom while micro USB port and sim slot are at the top.The screen is amazing. The 3.7\" Clearblack LCD (aka Super AMOLED or whatever you want to call it) gives you such vibrant colors that my retina-display iPhone 4 looks like a last-gen screen next to it, at least in terms of colors and contrasts. The touchscreen is very sensitive, though I've noticed it can be a bit jumpy at times. No idea if it's a software or hardware problem, or just my screen protector.The only problems I have with the designs are: a) the dedicated camera button. It's a two-stage shutter (slightly press to focus and fully to shoot) is a bit flimsy. b) the micro-USB port cover flips up and can easily be broken. And it stays this way while connected. (This has been remedied with the upcoming Lumia 900 btw.)Overall, this is the best looking phone I've seen in years. Kudos to Nokia for trying something new. And dare I say, they succeeded brilliantly.SOFTWARE:It's Windows Phone 7.5 Mango. You either love it, or hate it.Let me say that coming from Android/iOS, the first main differences I saw were the big and bold tiles, and the minimal homescreen. No gazillions of icons and folders cluttering up the screen. Everything is right there, in your face. Phone, SMS, Mail, Browser are all there and easily accessible the moment you turn on the screen. Very cool, I thought. But then, as an avid app user, I loaded up the Windows Marketplace. And boy, was I in for a huge disappointment. I'd known that this was a new ecosystem and there wouldn't be that many apps yet. But I didn't think that many of the iOS/Android apps (not games, don't care about those) that I often used wouldn't have an alternative for WP (more on this later).I was ready to return the phone. But then (yes, another turning point), I started using it. And I fell in love. The way Live Tiles work, instant updated info without loading the apps. The way \"People\" combines all/most of your social networks into one place. The way I stopped using my phone to do useless things and actually get stuff done. And of course, the way the Lumia 800 felt in my hands.  Also, slowly, I started discovering new ways to find the apps that I want/need. Sure, I had to compromise and discarded certain apps that I don't really need, but I did manage to gather a good number of apps in the end.Windows Phone 7.5 isn't perfect. I still hate the way copy/paste is implemented. I still think the keyboard is awkward at times and too sensitive at others. I hate that there's no jailbreak/root, or as WP users call it \"Interop unlock\". Or how background tasking has a 9-processes limit. Or how there's no way to change text size in SMS. Or that the default Marketplace is rather unwelcoming and harder to navigate. And many more. But these minor bugs and inconveniences all become irrelevant when you look at the big picture. Windows Phone 7.5 is a brilliant mobile OS. You might call it the smartphone OS for newbies. I'm guessing the reason why it hasn't attracted that many people yet is the lack of quality phones. We haven't seen anything that is so stylish, so cool that can actually compete with the annual iPhone and monthly Androids. Until now.I'm definitely getting a Lumia 900 when it comes out in a few months (though I'll miss the curved glass). Good job Nokia and Microsoft. You've won me over.Update: I forgot to mention that the 800 has battery issues (doesn't last very long). I hear that there's a new update out that has fixed this problem, but I'm still waiting for them to push it out to my phone. Will confirm when I get it.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great on AT&T; but cant send pictures", "Author": "MikeR", "ReviewID": "RKAFR7NYP5C8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "******EDIT*****Last week i noticed on my phone that there was a question mark inside the battery symbol. The phone would not charge and i could not tell how much battery i had left. I looked this up and it has happened on many different devices. They say to take the battery out and reset the phone, and see if that works, but the nokia battery is unremovable. I will have to send this one back  ='(......This phone is absolutely amazing and im using it on at&t.; This phone is unlocked but you need to go to wireless settings and go to edit apn and add \"wap.cingular\" to make it work with 3g/4g (hspa+) on at&t.; The only problem i am having is that i cant sent pictures if i figure out that, if its even possible, then this phone is perfect.

And for someone who has owned an iPhone and many different Androids I can tell you it is more than worth the switch. Here are some key reasons why:-Even on what is considered slower hardware these phones run amazingly fast.  Feels faster than an iPhone or an Android hands down.-Great battery life.  Even when I'm streaming Netflix on the go I'm not really worried about the battery.  With general use it outperforms other smartphones out there.-The OS itself it a joy to use.  Simple, intuitive, and more alive.  No need for widgets, install an app and pin it's live tile to the main screen and you get instant access to info that you want and need easily.  No going into apps, no swiping over to your widgets.  You pin whatever you want to the home screen, be it a contact, photo album, song, ebay bid item, calendars.  Its simply amazing how much information you can access without ever even going into an app and I love it.-Built in X-Box Live and Zune.  Having a system built into a phone for online gaming etc that has been tested and proven for years is great.  And although the Zune never quite took off you will be amazed at how great it is to use on this phone.  And it's better than the music players available on Android, and way more intuitive than the iPhone music player.  Hands down, these phones have the lead on music and games.-Dedicated camera button.  Access your camera even when the phone is locked.  Android and iOS have added this recently but Windows Phone does it better.  Just hold down the camera button and you can access the camera instantly without even having to unlock your phone.-Built in Bing Search.  May seem like a gimmick, but its powerful and easy to use.  Just hit the search button at the bottom of the phone to use it (or if you really don't like Bing the search button can be changed to use another search provider website).  When you do you have access to Local Scout, which uses your GPS to show you what is near you.  FInd Gas Stations, Dining, interesting hotspots in the area.  You get Music search which listens to music and gives you the name of the song. Bing Vision, which gives you the ability to translate text without typing it in, find an item by its barcode, scan QR Codes, and find DVD and Books online by just scanning the cover.  As well as voice search, you get everything you need for search without ever even downloading an app.-Built in FM Radio.  This may not seem like a big deal, but nobody else really has this in their phone and its great to have.  If you don't like carrying around a huge music collection and don't want to stream music over an app just listen to the radio.  Less battery is used and you get easy access to whatever local channels are available.I could go on and on but these are just some of the main points to get this phone, or any Windows Phone really.  HOpefully this helps you make the decision, you won't be disappointed.App Suggestions:-For Photo Editing, try Fantasia Painter.  You can do pretty much anything you could ever want to a photo and then some.  Its powerful and easy to use.-For Pandora, since there is no official Pandora App use Radio Controlled.  Its a great App and way better than the standard Pandora Apps I've used.-Ringtones, use easyRing&Music;, its a great ringtone app that even lets you download full songs and trim them down to make a custom ringtone.

I regret it now, it would have been so cool, I have seen other vintage cars with matte paint... Darn it! I still was moping around about my choice of Jeep paint, when it became necessary to replace my Android phone that went kaboom on me. I shopped around for the obvious, latest Android, latest iPhone, Samsung's LTE from AT&T; with a contract. I looked into the white iPhone 4, but then I thought, \"Don't do it again Al\" let's go with what is different, stop trying to follow everyone else. So I got myself the new Lumia 800 (in Matte Black!) it's unlocked which has the latest Windows Mobile version(I read all about this version, aka Mango) last year and all the talk of how Nokia and Microsoft are trying to compete with Android and iOS, blah blah blah. I decided to give it a try, so far it has been a month. I am using my X-Box live account, I have all my stuff synced up with a live account that backs up everything from my contacts to my photos via something called Skydrive, music was imported, all my documents from my old Android too. My Facebook, Tweeter, personal email and work email are merged into this mobile with something called Office 365. I don't want a contract from AT&T; or T-Mobile, but I heard that a newer version of Lumia will be released from AT&T; soon. I read that it is very similar, except it has LTE and a bigger screen. So far so good, I'm liking this Nokia-Microsoft experiment. So long as they keep it real like they did with this Lumia 800, I'm a believer.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Poki", "ReviewID": "R3T6R56Z0V4BXY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a new phone and didn't feel like the iPhone 4s was much of an upgrade over my iPhone 4 and the Galaxy Nexus was way too big and I never had good luck with android phones. I decided to give windows phone a try. I am so glad that I did. It was between the Lumia 800 or 710. The 800 has such great build quality.Hardware: It comes with only 16gb of memory. No expansion slot of any kind. With WP7, you get 25gb of free storage on Microsofts SkyDrive. The 1.5gHz processor is extremely fast and never has a problem with loading or scrolling through the OS. The Amoled screen is crisp, clear and bright. Its only a 800x480 but that is standard on all the WP7 phones. 8mp camera with a Carl Zeiss lens and twin LED flashes.Fit and Finish: The phone feels amazing in my hands. The one piece shell fits perfectly in my hand and it just feels so good. No gaps between the gorilla glass and the body. Nokia also includes a molded silicon/rubber case with the phone. It fits perfect so you never need to actually buy a case for it. It took me a while to get use to the button placement but I got the hang of it in a day or so.Screen: The Amoled screen is bright and vibrant. I never knew what I was missing until I saw this thing. The colors are so crisp. The curved glass makes it very easy to swipe left or right.Windows Phone: This is my first windows phone, mine came with mango (7.5). Its super smooth and slick. It never hangs up or has forced closes. The phone is only a single core processor but you would never be able to tell. Its the perfect balance between android and iOS. Its also really easy to use.Apps: Nokia includes a few nice apps. Its definitely not bloatware. Nokia Drive is a gps app that downloads all the maps for a country or region onto your phone. It gives turn by turn directions and you can use it offline since the information is stored on your phone. Nokia maps is a neat app that is similar to a google maps but with a lot more features. You can view the map in 3d, it shows traffic updates, and it gives you public transit routes with stops. It helped me navigate Portland, OR without a problem. You can also set it up to show you reviews and close by restaurants. Nokia Music is very similar to pandora and you can purchase the music from the zune store when you like a certain song.The windows market place has plenty of apps. If I can't find the exact app that is in the iOS/Android Market app store, I can easily find an app that can replace it. Also, WP7 has amazing voice features, which I didn't know about when I bought the phone (way better than Siri on my friends 4S). It also comes with a  full version of Microsoft Office that can be linked to their cloud services (Office 365, Sky Drive, Office Live, etc.)Camera: The camera is bit of a downer. Its an 8mp with dual LED flashes. There are so many settings its hard to a shot just right. I takes clear, focused pictures every time but there are so many filters to worry about.Battery Life: I consider myself a moderate data user. I check my emails off my phone, stream music, and update Twitter/Facebook. I get the phone off my charger about 8am and come home around 9pm. It has about 35% battery life left which is more than my iPhone, it use to have about 10% left.Overall, this phone is a great alternative to the iPhone or any android. Only complaints I have is the camera leaves something to be desired. The OS is smooth and reliable. Microsoft and Nokia hit a home run with the Lumia 800.

The OS is absolutely beautiful, the screen is amazing and everything runs like butter. Seriously, if you're unsure about buying this phone then all you need to do is to hold one in your hand for a few seconds and your decision will be made for you. A great job by both Nokia and Microsoft in everything from hardware design, to software design.Don't let the negative press about the lack of apps fool you. As of right now, the marketplace has 50,000 apps and from what I've read it's increasing at the rate of a few hundred apps per day. It's more than you want, has everything you need, and you're actually a lot less reliant on apps because of the way Windows Phone works. For those that are really concerned then yes there are fart apps on there too.I believe there's enough information and rave reviews about this phone online to help convince you so I'll throw in a few words about the seller. Global Mobiles did a great job of shipping and packaging, with the Lumia Box coming inside another Black Box all inside of the larger Amazon box. Global Mobiles was also kind enough to include printed instructions on how to get the phone in English (it boots up in German but you just have two clicks to make it English) and an adapter for the charger as the Lumia currently only comes with a Europe type charger.

One of the biggest negative comments I've read is about the cover for the charging port, but I absolutely love it - my other phones would gather dust in there over time, not this - and it's easy to open, I have a hard time picturing it breaking unless I just treat it like garbage.You get EDGE on T-Mobile, but that works fine for me - 80% of the time I'm around WiFi anyway.Battery life has been superb, and that's with WiFi and GPS turned on all day, and the screen on it's brightest setting.

I just froze, knowing that just a few days earlier I had taken off the case that came with it, because I wanted the sleek feel of the phone in my hand when I used it.I took a deep breath, bent down and picked up the phone, and took it inside under the kitchen lights to review the damage.  Once I'd brushed off the dust and other junk it had accumulated on my garage floor (don't judge me!), I realized that there wasn't a scratch on it.  NOT ONE!  I have no idea what part of the phone it first landed on from 5 feet up, because I couldn't see any damage.  The screen is fine, no chips or scratches from the floor, I can't believe it.

Here are just some things from my experience.  As far as the device and the hardware are concerned this is a fantastic phone. The build is very solid. The skin that's packaged with the phone is very good quality and changes almost nothing about its appearance. I don't like having to use a skin or a case though, and this phone is nice for people like me as well, because the body is rugged enough to survive without one. For this price I think a phone should be durable and attractive looking, and this phone is both.  The UI might take a little getting used to; I came from an android phone and it took me a day or so to be completely familiar with this, but really it isn't difficult. The phone is very fast where it can be, and what I mean is some apps like internet explorer 9 are just not very fast right now, so the phone cooks as long as the apps allow it to. Generally nothing is slow with this thing except ie9 and the windows facebook app, which really needs work. The hardware speaker is loud but not what you want to listen to music or other media from. You won't miss a call from lack of volume, but get some headphones if music is important to you because you won't want to hear it from the speaker.  I have tmobile in the US, so I can't speak for at&t; users here, but this definitely only works on edge on tmobile's network. There is wifi literally everywhere I go, so I haven't had a data plan in years, but if you're one of those people who \"needs\" 3G or better, wait at least until the lumia 900 comes out and see if you can find an unlocked device then. If you do get this one then go to the marketplace and download the nokia app 'network setup'. You'll need to run this to get MMS working on tmobile at least, maybe on at&t; also. After you do this the phone is truly unlocked, except for the 3G thing of course.  If you are into the android mindset of being able to modify your phone software, and make all your icons and homescreen look different 5 times a day, then you won't like WP7 for the same reason you don't like ios. Now that's fine, but if you are like me and you just want a simple interface that's fast and responsive (and so far has given me no force closes) then WP7 is right up your alley, and on this device it's fantastic. If 3G and 4G are deal breakers for you, then the lumia 710 might be worth looking at since it's tmobile branded and guaranteed to work state side.***My lumia 800 was imported from Germany, so it started up in German and that is also the language of all the printed material in the box. It came with a piece of paper from the seller stating, in English, what options to chose on initial startup to get the phone in English. It's completely painless, and after that it's totally in English, but there are 2 or 3 applications that you'll end up uninstalling because they were loaded for consumers in Germany. These apps don't seem to be of any use in the states. Just be aware that if you buy this import it could quit literally be from anywhere that its sold in Europe, and so also be in that country's language when you first turn it on.EDIT: I forgot to mention battery life. I've been using the heck out of this phone since I got it a few days ago. I can't say for sure how long it lasts on a charge, but it will definitely go an entire work day under heavy (wifi internet) use before you have to think about how much life it has left. Most places I look users say to give it a week to settle in, and apparently the firmware update gives an inaccurate battery life reading for the first few days. For example, my phone right now says it has 62% battery remaining and that it will last another 20hrs on that charge, with 12 hrs since my last charge.

I haven't tried it yet, but it does have the US maps available for download (that means the app can work without using data while your driving)Nokia also included a body skin to protect the phone, that thing fits so nicely on the phone, some people I showed it to didn't realize it wasn't part of the phone.

Windows 7.5 is a breeze to use -makes Android and iOS seem cluttered in comparison- and the hardware is absolutely stunning. Never had a phone made so well. The Sensation was child's play in comparison.There's no option to put a background wallpaper, hopefully something Microsoft will iron out as this OS grows, but there are other options for customization. The Lumia doesn't support TMobile's 3G band, but there's no noticeable lag. The Edge actually works about as well as the 4G on the Sensation. You've got to cut the sim card to fit into the mini-Sim slot but it's not a major concern if you purchase a SIM-cutter or get your carrier to cut it for you.

Kanthi", "ReviewID": "RASLRE2NSQISZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, if you are buying this listing you are getting a european version which supports only 3G bands - UMTS 2100, UMTS 1900 and UMTS 900. AT&T; uses UMTS 1900 & 850 bands. So you are missing support 850 band. Nokia has another version of the Lumia which supports - 2100, 1900 and 850. AT&T; deploys the 1900 or/and 850 networks depending the traffic and usage. So in many areas you would see a lower 3G performance compared to other AT&T; devices. I faced this issue in San Diego - La Jolla. So if you are planning to buy Lumia 800, wait until Nokia releases it in Feb 2012 through microsoft store. I am pretty sure Amazon also would carry stock of the Lumia 800 US version.Keeping this version aspect aside, i am extremely impressed with Nokia Lumia 800. Let me list out the pros and cons before explaining the issues in detail ... I mainly compared this phone with Blackberry Bold 9900 and iPhone 4S - since all these phones feature the same modem chipset from Qualcomm. I expected the voice quality and cell coverage performance to be very similar. I am not going to compare this with an Android phone because i haven't used one !** PROS **[1] Polycarbonate body with AMOLED display gives this phone a solid look and feel. No more \"Made in China\", rather \"Made in Finland\" -> Solid quality and finish.[2] Microsoft OS 7.5 + Tiles is an absolute winner on this device.[3] MS Software has been developed predominantly on the QC8655 Chipset which features a single core 1.4 GHz Snapdragon + 3G modem. Since Nokia used the same chipset and being the primary vendor for Redmond OS, i believe the hardware and software design seems to have been very tightly coupled. Hence user interface and responsiveness to user action is top notch on this phone.[4] Without SIM card, you can use an app called Tango to make voice calls over Wi-Fi to other folks who have Tango. Tango app has been developed and distributed on iOS, Windows mobile, android and PC's as well. Email synchronization and MSFT exchange support is awesome.[5] Internet explorer browser on the phone is extremely well developed compared to the sluggish ones on windows mobile 6.5. I would treat the browsing experience to be on par with iPhone 4S.[6] Battery bug which many people are referring to was not observed on my device. So it is not like all the Lumia devices are affected. I see that the battery operates normally and it will last one full day on normal usage.[7] Zune marketplace and music management is pretty good. It's not the best, but it is getting better day by day.[8] Nokia Drive + Nokia Maps - This is probably going to feature only on Nokia WP phone, these two apps are extremely handy. First of all it offers free voice navigation, something that is lacking on my iPhone 4S and the maps can stay offline, still provide you the navigation ![9] Camera - 8 MP, Carl Zeiss lens - Awesome with pictures, but the software sucks ! They really need to update the camera application on the Nokia or Windows side ... This camera is capable of taking some awesome shots, given the right software.** CONS **[1] Battery life is only as good as any other smartphone. It will last only for one full day and not beyond that. Nokia's past reputation of long battery haul is busted on this phone.[2] Voice quality is average compared to Blackberry Bold 9900 & iPhone 4S which uses the same QC8655 chipset.[3] Cell coverage was a little poor - this could be attributed to the fact that this particular unit didn't support one of the 3G bands of AT&T.; I am guessing this would be better on the Lumia 800 US version and it should be comparable to Blackberry Bold 9900 and iPhone 4S.[4] Phone's charging port and SIM card slot have an awkward design. I would prefer to have both of them on the side.[5] Coming from Nokia i would expect a slot for additional memory storage as well.[6] You need a windows account to setup your phone. I am not really a fan of this aspect ![7] Syncing contacts to WP phone via Mac is a big headache. As such there are no straightforward steps to do that. You have to export all the contacts to a different format, sync them to your windows mail account and then its get's automatically loaded to your phone ( assuming you have setup email/contacts/calendar based on your windows mail account ).[8] Traversing the email application is quite a challenge. I opened an email thread in my inbox and i could not find a way to return to my inbox right away. I had to read from the particular message all the way to the most recent message in the thread and then return to Inbox.** OVERALL ** - Microsoft/Nokia have struck a winning combination with the Nokia Lumia 800. MSFT marketplace is growing pretty rapidly and i am sure in the next one year or so, there would be plethora of apps to cover everyone's needs. At this point the marketplace cannot compete with Apple iOS but it definitely beats the crap out of a Blackberry.Nokia has truly turned around and have done an excellent job of tying the MSFT OS & their hardware. This is a perfect arrangement and they have set extremely high standards for any other windows phone competitor. They are also making sure they enter the LTE segment with Lumia 900. This is a step in right direction ...Microsoft has been squandering till now with the WP OS. But now they have made a complete turnaround with the Metro UI and tight integration of their software with Nokia hardware. Microsoft should continue promoting the OS and make sure the user experience is top notch. There are some short comings on the UI, which they are probably aware of and will fix in future releases. MSFT should ensure the WP market is lucrative for application developers to jump on and port their application from iOS or Android platform.If you are looking for an iPhone alternative, then this is the phone for you !

Over the years I have upgraded or simply replaced a number of NOKIAs and my loyalty may have been tested at times but it was never scorned. Until recently.My latest 6500s was at its last of its nine lives (after its second battery replacement and numerous drops) so I decided to bite the bullet and go shopping for a smartphone. I have always refused to submit to APPLE's fascism whereas I judged ANDROID's deep waters too dragon-rich for me, so a Windows Phone seemed to be my best option. Or so I thought.THE PHONE HARDWARE IS GREATIf I were to review the device itself, it would rate at 4.5 stars (and my past experience with NOKIA products would had made me round it up to a perfect score). Other than the flimsy USB door (that, in my case, I predict will not survive long enough to see the first snow) and the (cheap) plastic feel of the silver side buttons, the phone is perfect. Reception is good and sound quality (both sending and receiving) is excellent. Unfortunately, no matter how good the hardware may be,a smartphone is as good as its operating system. And the list of my grievances regarding the software is long...BASIC FUNCTIONS ARE MISSINGI know all about Apps, free and paid, and how they are supposed to enrich and personalize the experience smartphones get to offer. And after spending several afternoons raking the Windows Phone Marketplace I can tell you this: once a basic function gets yanked out, there is no getting it back intact!ALARM FAILSIt took me three days to find a CountDown Timer that is able to work after the screen saver lock kicks in. No such luck with the Alarm though. The Alarm will not work unless the phone is turned on. I have tried every suggested Alarm clock app and this problem remains. Apparently this is a well known problem. For over 2 years now!Think about it for a moment. Either at home or on a trip, you want to set the alarm before going to bed, turn the phone off (not only to preserve the precious battery juice but also to get some hours of privacy as well) and expect your phone to wake you up the next morning. But this is not allowed on a Windows phone! I have updated mine to WP7.8 but this function (as well as all that follow) is missing from the latest WP8 as well.Just because the iPhone does it this way, Microsoft, it does not mean it is the right way. Wake up! (apparently your alarm clocks did not go off either...)CHARGES ONLY IF TURNED ONWhen I bought my new LUMIA 800 I went to my cell phone service provider and requested a twin (micro)SIM card. Since I kept my old 6500s, I tried charging my LUMIA while it was switched off (the provider does not allow both SIM cards to be active at the same time). Surprisingly, the Windows Phone either switched back on or (if turned off while connected to the charger) it simply refused to charge!Again, to appreciate the problem, keep in mind that a smartphone will need to be charged every single day for 2-3 hours.TOTALLY IDIOTIC SOUND LIMITATIONSWith my old phones if I wanted to use any sound or song as a ringtone, wakeup music, SMS sound or eMail alert, I could just choose one from the phone folders. Any mp3 or wma file would do. And I could transfer them there using a simple USB connection and NOKIA's Suite. Well, if MICROSOFT has its way, those days are over.First off, you have to use a PC to install their own suite, Zune. You have to use this interface to transfer and synchronize files between your PC and your Windows Phone. So far, no foul, Zune works fine. And then you decide that the generic chimes provided by Microsoft are crap and want to customize how your phone sounds. No go.NOKIA tried to fix this by releasing a free RingTone Maker (only available for NOKIA Windows Phones) but that too comes with ridiculous limitations: only sound files less than 2MB can be used and even then, only a 30 sec soundbyte can be made into a ringtone! Why do we even have 16GB phones if such 1990's limitations are to be in place?PLEASE CHOOSE YOUR CUSTOMIZATION STRAIGHT JACKETSmartphones have much larger screens than our old phones. Why can we not choose the size of the font and strain to discern the phone numbers of our contacts? (There is a Big Phonebook App but it has to import all your contacts and it does not auto-update every time it is used).Smartphones have far greater processing power. Why can we no longer switch our contacts between a list and card format? In the much larger screen I can see less information about each of my contacts than I did with my 6500s.Smartphones can now project 16,000,000 colors. Why can we not choose to change the color of each individual tile?Swiping from the right edge will take you to the Apps list. Why is swapping in the opposite direction not allowed? It is not reserved for anything, so why yet another counterintuitive limitation?Finally, where are our easy to use and trusted Profiles!? The movie is about to start, am I to go through the damn menu to silence my phone?The lack of Applications for the N9 made me choose the LUMIA 800. As the days go by, I start to realize that I did not chose the lesser of two evils. And I have now seen the face of Evil.

Windows Phone trumps iOS and Android in so many ways (but it is not without faults).  For starters, battery life on android phones is mediocre at best and rarely get you through the day; this is especially true if you have a sensation, inspire, evo, etc.  iOS is sinfully boring but has fantastic apps and great reliability and is incredibly smooth.  I like wp7's metro UI because it is fast and simple without looking old like the iphone.  the menus are great and modern looking while at the same time fantastic to use.  switching between apps is great and the apps are generally more well made and more reliable than android apps, although they cost more.This phone in particular is great.  Like everyone says, the screen is topnotch with vibrant colors and deep blacks that compliment the black hardware better than anything I've seen (and I've seen them all).  It is not as clear as the iphone's display because of the pixel density, the iphone display is much finer to a noticeable degree.  but colors on the amoled display are great and so it outside visibility.  The display is also better on this phone than the GS series from samsung this is because wp7 compliments the display better than the candy looking rom they use on android devices.  The body of the lumia feels amazing in hand and even feels great with the case that nokia has included.  I bought the black model after seeing how the blue was too light for my tastes.  Many complain about the camera but it is actually fantastic and viewing photos on the screen make it all the better.  I have used it for the last week taking photos of my kindergarten students and I just visited the temple of heaven here in Beijing, China.  The camera has easy settings to fine-tune photos on the fly and make pictures of anything look great....just remember to use the two stage button properly and autofocus.  I capture clear photos that reproduce what I see very well or in some cases they produce what I want it to after the affects.  The videocamera is good but not great.  Phones tend to take choppy videos and this is good but not worth touting \"hd\" over like all these companies do... And the phone is faster and more fluid than other phones out there, including my dual-core htc sensation, my choppy old atrix, and my girlfriend's iphone 4s (although this browses webpages faster).  WP7 is just smooth.  My only complaint is that some apps require internet usage and it loads that before the app loads so you'll wait 1-3 seconds whereas android apps pop up quickly before they fully load.  Compare the two on and you'll see.  This phone is much quicker than gen1 WP7 phones. The phone also has far better battery life than the sensation; on par with an atrix.  I use if for music, games, reading, and browsing all day.  maybe 1-2 hours of streaming music through bluetooth, 2 hours of reading or surfing, and 1 hour of gaming.

The first thing I saw after opening the package was a piece of paper saying that this phone comes is German because it's manufactured in Europe, this paper is in English and shows you how to set up your phone to any language you want. So I did, I set up mine to English.All the manuals are in German, however, I downloaded the PDF's from nokia.co.uk and they come in English, I know that some people would give it a 4 stars, but as for me, I don't see it as being a problem.The manual is VERY complete and contains all the instructions for the battery itself, thing that is lacking in most of modern electronics and that I consider very important, so, following the instructions, I connected the USB cable in the outlet - which comes with a small white piece of plastic to connect to the outlet, and it comes with the converter, so if you are in US, you won't have a problem at all - and the phone vibrated and it started in German, as expected. I followed the instructions from the paper and there it was, in English.After some basic settings, the phone showed up the Windows Phone screen with the tiles.

I have to say that, HONESTLY, all the phones I used so far, the screen was smaller, so I am pretty satisfied, plus, if the screen is way big, it's kinda uncomfortable to carry around, which doesn't happen with this phone.The screen is bright and looks NICE !

I can bear with EDGE for the moment given my tasks. Besides, bandwidth caps will deter you from doing anything heavy in terms of streaming, no? All in all, this is the best phone I have ever used. Its sad that it won't be able to be upgraded to Windows Phone 8 but many of those features wouldn't be relevant to a windows phone 7 user anyways (dual-core CPU support doesn't matter if you have a single core processor, support for higher screen resolution doesn't matter if your screen already is beneath that resolution). Still, its worth buying.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone! Great Purchase", "Author": "Robin - Canada", "ReviewID": "RFIISZW5DUGHE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Definitely worth the money I paid for this phone. I absolutely love the Windows 7 platform it has the apps you need, and has a kickass camera. at this point nokia is coming out with their windows 8 phone at the end of september, and If its anything like this one its definitely worth the buy.It has a solid construction, and very reliable. Dropped it several times on marble floor and its doing fine. reception is very clear and wifi range is good. One guy said he brought it with him on his trip to mount everest. the camera is an 8MP carl zeiss lens, and takes great photos. The app store is nowhere near as plentiful as android or apple, but it has your most important apps such as facebook, cloud storage, whatsapp, linked in, nokia drive, news, etc. and a lot of cool xbox games like final fantasy.The battery life on this is incredible typically on a full charge you can get a solid 30 hours of use, which includes hourly email updates, weather updates, whatsapp updates, and one news update as well as maybe 100 text messages and a few phone calls. if you talk on skype for 30 minutes it drains the battery like 15 percent, which is pretty good.Overall, my main con of this phone is that the multi-tasking on windows phone could be better ( i really loved the webos multitasking UI). Also its not 4G, but then you should get the lumia 900 if thats what you are looking for. but everything else is solid and just works like it should. I hope windows phone becomes more popular as it has a lot of potential to be as big as the apple.

This phone is my favorite phone by a landslide. The fit and finish of this phone is second to none. My only regret is waiting this long to make the move.When it comes to social media, communication (texting, instant messaging), taking pictures, the Windows Phone is just so much faster and easier than any of the other phones I have owned. It's really like the normal things people do on a phone has just been thought out better and it requires fewer clicks.Socia media - Facebook, Live, LinkedIn and Twitter all all integrated. You can see all of your updates, or respond to your friends from one location, the People hub. It also shows all of your friends pictures from all of the different social media apps in the single location. No need to launch each app to see what's happening. Awesome!Communication - Threaded communication means that your Facebook or Live instant messages and texting is all in the same place. When you go to text someone, you can instantly see if they are online with one of the other apps and you can chat where they are...of if they are offline, go ahead and text. Again, no need to launch the different apps to get in touch with friends.Zune software is incredible. I now pay $9.99 per month for a subscription and I can download as much music as I want...so can my wife and so can my kids...or we can stream music to the PC's, Mac, or Xbox....all for $9.99. On the phone, hear a song you like, click on the search button and then click on the music button...it identifies the song and you can simply download it right there. My personal favorite is going into artists I like and swiping to see similar or related artists and downloading other music I wouldn't have considered.Taking pictures with this phone is great. As soon as I got the phone, there was an update so I am not sure if the update improved the camera, but based on some other comments, I would have to assume that is the case. Regardless, the dedicated camera button means that I can take the locked phone out of my pocket and I can push the button which automatically turns the phone on, unlocks it and goes into the camera for snapping a picture. You can have it set to automatically upload to Skydrive or Facebook, or you can simply click to post...I heard someone describe it as \"pocket, to picture, to post\"...it really is nice.Apps: The apps are great. I downloaded every app that I have on my iPad and on my Kindle fire. The only app I am missing was audible. Otherwise, the apps that I had on my other devices are also available on the Windows Phone. For games, it's also pretty cool that the Xbox integration displays all of my info including my Avatar. Not a big deal for me, but it's kind of fun.On Tmobile, I can only get 2G or Edge network. I know that there will be times where that will probably matter, but I find that 70% of the time, my phone is connected to wifi instead of cell when I am in a place where I might be searching for stuff. On the other hand, the Nokia GPS downloads the maps, so cell connection for GPS isn't necessary. Most of the apps download stuff in the background, so compared to my previous tmobile 4G phone, I can honestly say, I haven't noticed any difference. I will probably have to try some side by side cell tests to see the difference. . .bottom line, if you are in a place to have a cell signal, it works fine. If you don't have good reception (you wouldn't have a faster network connection anyway), so it's no different. Driving down the road, I hold the Windows button for voice commands and I ask for an address. It finds the address quickly and then provides the turn-by-turn...if that works quickly, then everything else is pretty easy.Only negative...no forward facing camera. However, again, after having the iPhone and an Android phone that had one...I can say that it's really more of a gimmick for me. At the end of the day, if I am going to be sitting in a place to do a video call, I wouldn't be doing it on my phone. Still, I think it was a dumb move not to include the FF camera.After seeing my phone, my wife just ditched her Android phone and went to Tmobile today...she bought the Lumia 710 (4G).Well done Nokia!", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stunning hardware (on T-Mobile)", "Author": "Philip Skeete", "ReviewID": "R3NN8WXG71EEVM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:This is a beautiful phone, it has that same addictive feel in your hand that the iPhone 4, it's hard to put down. I current carry an unlocked iPhone 4 on T-Mobile and a Galaxy S2 on Verizon. The Galaxy is clearly the fastest and spec rich phone of the three but feels cheap and I find android in general lacks the fluid UI of the iPhone. To my huge surprise I actually liked Win 7.5 more than iOS, I hated the old Windows phone OS's and expect more of the same. The newer version or Windows Phone is simply a new beast. Microsoft took all the best aspects of iPhone's simplicity and went one better with live tiles and great office integration. Its easy to use and very intuitive and the Lumia 800 just feel perfect in your hand. If you use Microsoft Office this phone is wonderful.Cons:My iPhone 4 works pretty well on EDGE data, and locking to EDGE I get two days of battery life and I very rarely find myself wishing I was on 3G. I found the Windows 7.5 on the Lumia seemed to have a bit of a harder time on EDGE. It also seemed to lack the insanely good signal lock I have come to expect from Nokia phones. The Nokia/MS mapping apps don't get by as easily on EDGE as the iPhone. I would not say it's a big problem, but I did find myself tethering to my Galaxy whenever I could.The other thing I did like is that this isn't a carrier unlocked device, the unit I received was software branded for Vodaphone Germany and had been opened and unlocked via an unlock code. I actually wanted an unbranded phone. I would have preferred to see this listed in the description and I would probably not have bought a branded phone as it has all the Vodaphone app links.Overall:A beautiful phone and a magnificent OS, Microsoft and Nokia are on to a winner here.

Setup was a breeze; all of Nokia's services work as advertised; right out the box I was able to connect to AT&T; HSPA network (where available). I did have to buy a SIM cutter to cut my Focus SIM to fit into the 800, since it uses a micro SIM.Overall my experience has been great, however, the MAJOR problem I have with this phone is the camera. The problem was so major I contacted Amazon to return the phone to the seller. As I've mentioned I have a Samsung Focus, which takes pretty decent photos for a 5MP camera; my iPhone 3g also took decent photos, but when is came to the Lumia 800, after correctly changing the camera settings STILL takes TERRIBLE photos.Other issues I have with this phone are:1. battery life2. Missing features native to WP. i.e.  a bunch of camera settings, available on all other WP, are missing3. Although the screen is of EXCELLENT quality, it is too dim/light and has a dark tint to it.

The performance of the touch screen is really good. I was a bit afraid that windows phones would have much less apps, but all the apps I knew from Iphone or Android phones that wanted I was able to find. Compared to Lumia 900, the screen is a bit smaller but for me that was a plus, because too big phones are uncomfortable to carry (at least to me, considering that I always like to have my phone in my pocket), plus, the 900 unlocked was $300 more expensive. The battery life us very good. I usually charge it while I am sleeping, get-up at 7-8 am and do not need to re-charge it during the day. When I go to sleep, about 12 am, the phone still has some battery charge so I'd say for me it's been lasting more than 14-16h. The colors, the quality of the graphics are outstanding. The only thing that would make this phone even better is a front camera to be able to skype and a better camera for taking pictures. The pictures are not bad, actually, but they are clearly less quality than old my sony dsc 6 megapixels, which I bought in 2005. One of the features I like the most from this phone (shared with other nokia smartphones) is the stand alone GPS. It's like having a GPS included in the phone without the need of data usage. I also have a GPS in my car and I made them work together and I'd say the phone is actually better than the GPS. It is very useful to be able to download the maps for different cities, countries, etc for free.

Additionally, the little cover over the USB charging port broke about two weeks after I bought the phone.  This would not be a huge problem, except that without the usb cover in place, the other cover over the SIM card and the battery is loose, and comes off easily (very poor design).

NO WAY. MS chooses to exclude (or in my case p.off) all its Outlook clients, and even Office (which is there but hellishly complicated). MS misses the oportunity to create its own eco-system around people who mix professional and private use of the phone: this is remarkable, and I am convinced, will haunt them.

Build and Style2. Nokia Drive / Nokia Maps3. DisplayCons1. Unreliable OS2. Lack of popular appsDetails:My experience with Nokia Lumia is a never ending daily struggle and I regret the fateful decision of ordering a Lumia 800 in December last year. My experiences / issues:1. The first model received had issues with battery longevity. After a week, Nokia replaced this model with a new one.2. The new model still had lingering issues with battery longevity. Nokia issued an update that was supposed to fix the problem. However, instead of fixing the issue, it led to a worsening of the issue. First visit to Nokia Care.3. All is well for couple of months. Suddenly, one fine day Lumia's screen freezes. The issue is discussed at [...]. Another visit to Nokia care.4. Nokia returns the set claiming that the problem is fixed (however, no explanation of what the problem was and what the fix was). Used the set for two weeks, and again the problem resurfaces and the screen freezes. Another visit to Nokia care in the offering.Apart from the above, there are number of issues that made me realize how I used to take the absence of the issues for granted in other sets. For example,1. Intermittent automatic reboots once / twice every 3-4 weeks of usage. It seems that the phone has brain of its own and realizes that it is hosting a Windows OS so a reboot is customary.2. When ending a call, Lumia will take almost 2-3 minutes before allowing me to the opportunity to redial.3. USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) does not work, denying me the easy way to check my prepaid balance. Now the only way is to call the Service Providers IVR and go thru the multi-hop mennu system to get the same information.4. Every update of the OS/firmware release by Nokia wipes my data on the phone, no matter how minor the update.  This even includes all the apps that I would have downloaded.There are a number of other minor quirks, that I am now willing to overlook - thanks to the issues mentioned above.

The 2nd adapter has the USB port to plug into, that goes to the phone. I don't like that part.The phone has a really poor design with the power button not indicated! Actually, none of the buttons have any markings on them! The SIM card slot & charging port are on top of the phone. The up, down volume settings, power button, & camera button are on the right side of the phone. The speaker is at the bottom of the phone. The camera is at the back, in the center of the phone.

The battery runs out very fast even though I barely use the phone & I mean in terms of camera, internet which means wi-fi. I have to charge the phone daily. I switch off my phone daily at night around 11 p.m. till 8 a.m. While I charge it, the phone is off but it kept turning back on. There's something wrong with the phone. The phone has to be on while charging it, I suppose which is silly. The phone does not indicate that it was fully charged. I have to turn on the screen to see if has been fully charged. how silly!I had a nokia E71. That phone had more built- in applications than this phone does. Only things good about nokia lumia 800 are that it has a decent camera quality & music player.The E71 has a recorder in the phone to record my voice & I could e-mail the file I created. It has a call log to see the call duration & when was the last call. I had mp3 files which were music files- I could choose any of them to set as a ringtone.. When some one calls, the E71 would tell the person's name.  Nokia lumia 800 doesn't show me the last call's duration nor do the rest that I mentioned in this paragraph. I will have to install applications to cut out mp3 file or install a voice recorder.Please don't buy this phone. This phone doesn't have the applications I want. I bought this phone through Wireless Everything. Wireless Everything company in NY provide really poor service. I called daily to get a chance to speak to the technician about this phone.

Latest was the Nokia C6-01 came with Symbian and I upgrade to Anna then Belle. I love my C6-01 but I wanted to try windows phone, so I bought Lumia 800.Cons I found in 2 weeks are basic Nokia characteristics you will lose with Lumia windows Mango.1- Can't send any type of files using Bluetooth at all. You lose a simple ability to send mp3s, pics or anything using Bluetooth.2- You lose video-out. Option I used on C6-01 to shows pics or movie Tvs. In Lumia is gone.3- You lose functionality of all your previous wired nokia headsets or any wired headset. With C6-01 any headset worked (volume, forward, pause, etc.) With Lumia you can't use those commands any more; you just can listen to music and speak during conversation. Only with the original 1 button headset that answers calls, or pause music, then you are done.4- This one I can't believe, you lose the front camera. No front camera in recent phone is unacceptable.5- Zune software in a pain to work with. You also lose mass storage, file browsing. The only way to feed you phone is throw Zune software. If that's the case I prefer Nokia suite but you not compatible.6- No micro SD slot, limited to 16 GB (at the end are around 12.5). You have cloud access but will cost you and make it slow.7- No notification light for messages or missed calls.8- Camera I prefer C6-01 quality, Lumia's sometime are too dark or to bright.9- Basic apps are gone, Nimbuzz, waze, angrybirds, opera, friut ninja, joikuspot, etc. Whatsapp is slow, Viber is beta, etc.10- Battery life can be better11- Volume control for apps is the same for ringing, very frustrating. To set phone in silent you have to lower volume to zero.12- Lack of settings and customization in everything (you can notice if you already used Symbian)13- Msn messenger is too basic and merge with SSM, can be trouble to some.14- Even so the software run smooth, Nokia launch 1.4ghz single processor while other brands are launching dual cores and more rom.15- In Internet explorer there is no forward bottom, no find option. Using tabs is hard to navigate you need to access options/tabs to select them.16- Can't rename folder, files. Can't move them between folders, can't select several files or pics at the same time. No options. You can do all this basic commands with Symbian.17- Can't share internet inbuilt app, haven't fine any third party app allow sharing internet. Inaceptable.18- and more...Pros: are all normal pros, nothing new. Basically this phone will work for a normal to lite user, with basic needs.I will love to see a high end hardware phone with Symbian on it.

And I realise it's a combination of Windows Phone and (hastily?) rewritten Nokia apps, so maybe it will get better...but maybe it won't.So here are some random pain points that I've come across in trying to get my phone up and running:1. The screen is bright and easily seen outdoors - and through polarised glasses - but the surface is so slick it's really hard to type on without making heaps of errors.2. And the on-screen keyboard is too small so that makes it worse. And the placement of action buttons - esp. the 'Send' button - is too close to the keyboard so it is too easy to send a half written email or text.3. You can rotate the phone but not everything rotates with you. The home screen icons do not rotate for instance.  Small stuff for sure, but really annoying when other phones get it right.4. The lock code screen has an 'emergency call' button under the '7' key and next to '0'. Don't use these numbers in your lock code, it's way too easy to press 'emergency call' when unlocking the phone.5. Internet Explorer seems way dumb. The hard-coded back button exits apps, but not in IE. There it takes you back a page so to get out of IE you have to traverse back through web pages until you can exit (or open tabs and cancel them all then back button out, either way it is clunky).6. Microsoft has been progressively dumbing down your ability to configure their software on the PC for years, and Windows Phone is no exception. I have yet to find a way to configure the Nokia so my Network Solutions POP3 mail account can be accessed because I am required to set ports and Windows Phone does not allow this.7. There is a hard-coded 'Search' button that is not context sensitive to the app you are using. I keep clicking it in Contacts when I want to search for someone but that button jumps off to Bing (and only Bing it seems, I can't reassign it so far). There is a another search button in the Contacts app that you need to use and it's just a waste of screen real estate and a clumsy user interface design.8. The excellent Nokia Navigation app - which is FREE!! and almost worth buying a Nokia on that basis alone - has been changed. I used to save locations, which was really useful for travel as you could save your hotel or office address for the duration rather than having to enter that in each time. But that feature has been removed so it's less useful. It also no longer says street names which is disappointing. (On the plus side, they have added back in the ability to navigate to a Contact address.)9. Like many supposed 'smart' phones if you set an alarm you cannot turn the phone off and have the alarm sound. It's a minor point but I used my E71 as my alarm clock in the morning knowing it would sound whether I had the phone one or off (the explanation I was given in the shop was \"But you're phone is charging overnight, why would you turn it off?\").10. The finger control is too fussy. If I swipe up the screen to scroll but my finger is near the left hand edge, it consistently scrolls right to the adjacent running app. Other niggles with the scrolling occur along these lines to the point that I have no confidence in where the screens will end up.11. Copy/paste or cut/paste is definitely not intuitive, it definitely does not work like Apple (OK, that's fair, patents and IP and Copyright and all that) but when you have to RTFM to figure out how to cut/paste it's annoying. And you can't copy from any text on the page - try copying from an IE web page and see what I mean!12. Speaking of cut/paste, just moving the cursor around is painful. Microsoft needs to do some work on that front.13. The Microsoft Marketplace seems a pretty lonely place at the moment but Nokia's never had a paucity of apps so I guess that's not much of a change.14. There is 16GB of memory but no slot for micro-SD cards and honestly, you can fill up 16GB pretty quick these days so more memory would be better.One major, blow-me-out-of-the-water problem is ZuneRhymes with 'loon' apparently and yep, I can see why. Zune is just so horribly not Windows that it's painful to use. It is also hard to navigate because the concept of work-flow seems to have been lost in the fancy graphics. Using Zune also means that Nokia's own PC Suite and Ovi software is now redundant. But Nokia's PC Suite did more than just load the phone with images and music and all of that useful functionality has just gone away.The final problem is shared with most smart phones...battery life. Use your phone hard and you'll be lucky to see out a working day before you need the charger. (Though the charger is pretty sexy.)I can't see the Lumia 800 being the halo phone that Nokia so desperately wants. It looks good, the screen is bright and the physical form factor is fine.
