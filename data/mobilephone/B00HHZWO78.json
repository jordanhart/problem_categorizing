With their Life series they raised the bar and with this Pure phone they hopped over the bar and landed on their two feet. Quad Core processor, 2GB of ram, and 32GB of storage.The phone itself is built like a champ. A solid 1 piece of polycarbonate encloses the phones massive 5 inch full hd display with IPS technology. The camera is 13mp on the back and boy does it shoot and take some good videos and pictures. Easily bests my Nexus 4's 8mp. The phone is slim and it feels really good in the hand. Like I said the build quality is fantastic.It has all the wireless you want, but with no NFC. 2.4 gHz bands for wifi only. GPS and bluetooth are here (4.0) So why did this only get 4 stars and not 5?Very simple. The GPU on this is two years old. The powerVR graphics card. Now that is not bad for a device with a 720p display or lower, but when you are pushing 440+ PPI, you need a more powerful one. The CPU is by Mediatek and truthfully, they make good processors. No complaints with that, but that GPU is a soar spot. There are two live wallpapers that I really like, and they would not run at all on this device. Just completely bogged down the phone. I know many people love FHD phones, but maybe this device should have had a 720pP display and not the FHD with this GPU. Otherwise excellent phone and I cannot wait to see what else Blu brings in the future. They also mentioned a 4.4 update coming by the end of Q2 2014. Worth a look.EDIT: March 3rd 2014. Friday I used it outside as a GPS. GPS satellites, and WiFI plus all the Google location permissions turned on and the phone for over 10 minutes could not pick up a precise location. After the 10 mins I just gave up. Returned the phone as Amazon did not have the white in stock per my return. Really a shame too, it is a really nice phone. Not sure if my unit was defective as per the GPS module, but I did in fact return it. Maybe later down the road when Amazon gets the white in stock, I'll pick up another one.

I read a lot of reviews on this phone and got me curious so i got one. i turned of or disable a lot of apps on this phone to save on batt and keep plenty of ram free for other things. This phone runs smooth and is fast. I like the graphics and the sound quality. There are some things i'm a lil disappointed on like no sd card so it make transferring of my music files slow via blue tooth. Its light in weight for in size. I didn't use any of the smart gestures features. Its good to know that they are there. The other thing i don't like about the phone is the accessories i can't find any. After i disable a lot of the apps that i know i don't use the batt last me 2 days i watch videos listen to music ,text take pics and play games on it. What i like the most about it its compatible to my mac i can transfer files with ease and back up my files as well.

Warmbier", "ReviewID": "R1C3UKM80DL3SJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I've been looking at Android phones for a couple of weeks now - I'm an iPhone user since the first generation and have been an \"apple person\" since then.  I wanted to look at Android, gain a larger screen and have a lower cost option as a backup in case my iPhone 5s ever went down or was stolen.It took about a day to get the apps I was used to using on the iPhone from one of the android marketplaces (Amazon or Google), move over contacts and customize the look and feel of the device - once that was done I began to \"road test\" the phone for a few days to see if I could make a go of it and to see if or where there were any gaps in functionality or usability between what I was used to in iOS and Android.  In the first couple of days I was concerned that I may not be able to find some of the more critical apps I had been using on the apple device on android - with only a couple of exceptions (Amazon Prime Viewer, the Zmodo security camera viewer were really the only exceptions and those weren't deal breakers).The positives first:  The screen is large and in charge.  The display is very clear at most angles, the pixels per inch and off angle viewing IS impressive.  The layout of the physical buttons and capacitive options, home and back buttons are fine though the lighting of those buttons does go off after a short period of time - you probably won't notice after using the phone for any length of time so that's not really an issue.  The specs are decent - quad core processor, 2GB of RAM, etc.  I've had no issues with the device locking up or freezing.  The modified interface isn't that bad - I think that I would prefer stock Android and hopefully BLU won't make that many changes to KitKat when it becomes available for OTA update.  Since BLU isn't a top tier phone manufacturer they almost have to include screen protectors and covers - you're probably not going to find more than a couple options even on-line for this device.  I have the black version and it's a nice satin or mat finish - it doesn't attract finger prints and seems easy to clean when smudges do appear.  WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular all seemed to work fine though artist, track, and album info doesn't display when BT streaming is done via spotify as other devices work in that area.Here's where the BLU LIFE PURE looses a star:  The cell data speed isn't full 4G (LTE) - this isn't a deal breaker in my opinion for a couple reasons - the first is many carriers only support 4G speeds in limited areas and with limited devices.  I'm on AT&T; and get pretty decent speeds with a Samsung Note 3 and Apple iPhone 5s - those are both top tier smartphones that would cost twice as much as the LIFE PURE off contract - the second reason is that in most places I'll be using this device I have access to WiFi.  I'd also ding the device a star for it's \"smallish\" battery and no option to replace it - 2000mAh probably won't work for even the most occasional use user - it reminds me of having to find a charging cable for an iPhone after an update where the battery life was reduced dramatically.  In my opinion I would gladly give up a millimeter or 3 for a larger battery or even better a replaceable one.  The audio over Bluetooth streaming or even connected via the 3.5mm jack is very \"flat\" and has little dynamic range - coming from an iPhone (which is really an iPod with a phone when it first was introduced) I didn't realize how spoiled I was with the built in EQ.  Problem solved with a couple free EQ apps on the marketplace.  Lastly while 32GB of storage isn't bad more would be nice and a SD slot would be best.  The camera - megapixels do not equal great pictures and this smartphone proves it.  For pics within a few feet and with a little fiddling in the camera app's settings you can take decent snaps but get beyond 8ft. or so  and indoors you'll probably be taking some blurry anything but sharp shots.  As stated before what can you really expect out of a phone at this price point.  You don't have to pack your point-and-shoot camera if you have an iPhone or Nokia Lumia or top tier Android (Samsung, HTC, or even LG) with this phone I wouldn't leave home without that extra camera if you want to get decent pics - this device is a phone with a camera not a camera phone.The limitations listed above that caused this device to receive 4/5 stars are pretty much known things going in to this purchase or could be worked out with some work and downloading - the battery (capacity or not being replaceable) is probably it's biggest most fatal flaw.  If I were in close range of a USB charger and knew I wouldn't be taking many pics or was taking along a dedicated camera I could see this as a daily driver.Going forward for my next Android device I'll look for the following:-Replaceable battery (only non replaceable if it's a \"monster sized\" battery (3000mAh or bigger)-A micro SD slot that takes 32GB or larger cards - even though I'm not an MP3 \"fiend\" being able to use the device for storage is a nice feature that Apple doesn't openly support.  Fully loaded up with apps, pics, and music via Spotify I'm still at about 10GB free and there are cloud solutions to help out - having my own content though is king when you're on a plane or where there's no WiFi.-Approx. 5\" display - this device has made me a convert to larger than 4.5\" ones.-A top rated camera - I don't really care about megapixels as long as it's better than 5MP-gorilla glass or equivalent - as large as these displays are getting it's only a matter of time before a crack or drop happens-Stock android - ROM manager doesn't seem to recognize the BLU LIFE PURE and I'm concerned about the few locations where custom ROMs are available - BLU has stated that KitKat will be available shortly but that would a couple months ago.I'll report back later as to how the device performs over time.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "love love love love this phone!", "Author": "Megan G.", "ReviewID": "R64UQOKA10M1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I brought this phone because my galaxy s 3 broke but when I tell you this phone is the best phone I have ever had the camera is so crystal clear the phone is a nice size and the speakers are very loud it is really an awesome phone.

I use at&t; prepaid and was looking for an unlocked phone...was looking around on different websites when stumbled on BLU phones. I had never heard of this company but read critics & user reviews, which were encouraging. Our main criteria was around $300 phones,good screen size and good camera. And BLU LIFE PURE had all of those, at least on paper. Then saw 16 encouraging reviews on Amazon and ordered a Black last week. We were very happy. Excellent 5\" screen size and the phone is fast. The 13mp camera is very good in daylight and OK indoors. For indoor photos there seems to be grains. But overall they are good. I used the Black one for around 2 days and was happy on all aspects. The battery life is good. Around 2-3 hrs of internet use drained approximately 22% of the battery life. I don't know what's good standard in this, but the battery went for 2 days and still not fully discharged. I was and happy and ORDERED THE 2ND PHONE, this time a White. Now I have 2 Life Pure, within a span of 1 week. I like the white more than black & I am using the White one (I am male).

The phone did great, and never lagged in anything I did - except, the battery life is quite poor. The phone only has a 2020mAh battery, and while I knew that wasn't big, I figured it would still last a good amount of time, as it does use a MediaTek processor. But, that's not the case, as I could watch the battery drain 1% every 2 - 3 minutes just from looking at the screen of this phone. And while the display was probably my favorite thing, it's most likely the thing that killed the battery. A small battery like that should not be a running a 1080p screen. Battery rants aside, the air and smart gestures were also just a poor attempt. The air browse hardly ever worked, and only worked when my hand was about 1 foot above the sensor, and none of the smart gestures, such as smart answer (call picks up when you place phone on ear) worked either. I honestly think they shouldn't have even tried to implement those features. Now, aside from all that, if you dont mind those few things, this phone is really nice, and it got me a lot of compliments, and the camera on it is great - front and back. The weight is great as well, everyone who tried my phone commented on it. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't need a battery that lasts more than 3 hrs of Netflix, and someone who doesn't care for smart or air gestures (by the way, I didnt even have them on, I never would have used them if they did work).", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast shipping and nice smartphone", "Author": "Carlos Convers", "ReviewID": "R2PDRRIL7CXGOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is an excellent smartphone and the cost is low if one compare with other brands.

I had to return the first one from the buyer I purchased because there were some black dots (2-3) so I thought was the pixels issues. Got another one had same black dot around exact place. Looks like it's a dust that is already in the screen protector for some reasons.This phone is for people who likes to change phone every year. Its cheap (compared to many other of similar caliber), and you don't mind giving it or selling it or even you damaged it. Functionality wise it seems to be built quite good. Although I wouldn't give it a 4 or 5 star. may be 3 and half star. So if you are looking for some phone to last for many years, this is not the one for you.It is fast, very close to my Samsung Galaxy S4 active. The phone is quite light when compared to others. This is my choice. But for others it might feel cheap. I am using it T-Mobile and I have no problem using it.System wise It has couple of nice features that even my Samsung doesn't have or maybe I didn't see.Will definitely  choose this phone over Samsung Galaxy S4 if I have to pay from my pockets ( my company bought me the S4).Comes with some extra stuff, but the case is extremely light thin and fits perfectly. It is great because you won't find the case in the market easily that fits this phones.The phone is little bigger in size ( in length) than S4 because of spacing in top and bottom around 1/4 inch.Will update more features as I use it more.

However, it has terrible GPS, and the software is pretty annoying. The GPS often time takes minutes to fix a location (IF it actually works); however, there are fixes for this that users have posted online (some of which require rooting your device). I was able to use one of the fixes online, and I now get a GPS fix within 15 seconds. This phone has an AWESOME front camera! A few things I dislike about the software:1. The launcher is NOTHING like what is typical of android -- Heavily skinned, no app launcher, wallpaper is BLURRED2. The wallpaper is blurred, even if you use an alternate launcher.. You use live wallpapers to override this, if you so choose. There are some nice live wallpapers in the Play Store, some even let you customize the background.3. Default messaging app grossly reduces the size of images when sending through MMS; you can use an alternate app for messaging as a workaround. I use Hangouts.I've read online that a lot of people are having issues with Straight Talk (either data, MMS, or both). I can verify that I am currently using Straight Talk (AT&T;) with this phone (using the APN settings posted on the ST site, phone type = other). I was not able to send MMS the first day; however, I believe this issue was caused by porting in my phone number from another carrier. I used this phone with T-Mobile for a few days before porting, it worked fine with them as well. With both carriers, I am able to get 4G (HSPA+).", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "High volume", "Author": "Abydes", "ReviewID": "R2A561SGUT3GHV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the phone but the first level of volume is too high and it cannot be adjusted...I cannot listen music with the earbuds....good for loud people!", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "not the very best", "Author": "Sulamita", "ReviewID": "R1MJ4FNXPKQVN0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i didn't like it because it didn't work the right wayand i recommend it for little kids the way it works...", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is a Amazing phone I love it better than my old iphone 4s !", "Author": "Oleg", "ReviewID": "RXK0J2LICQXXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone comes with many accessories worth the price, get's much attention, which I personally enjoy showing off !! thanks.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice!", "Author": "Brenlon S.", "ReviewID": "R3CVJFTMHEIC1J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BLU  Exceeded expectations with this one, Would really love to see what's next.
