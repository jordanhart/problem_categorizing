I got myself and android tablet, 8.9 Samsung galaxy tab. There I play, work, watch movie, ETC. But I still needed a phone. You can get a smartphone but it is very big, and the baterry life sucks. I used to own and iphone 4. Got sick of charging baterry every 5/6 hours.This phone is outstanding, you actually have facebook, the camera is fairly decent and it is very compact, so I can always take it with me everywhere, texting is easy, the display... can't complain. The signal is 4 times better than my iPhone 4s. Never missed a call.I charged it on Friday, we are on Sunday... and it still has baterry. That's all I was looking for, a Phone that is designed for what a phone is supposed to be designed.. Talk!!1. Excelent signal2. Email account support3. Facebook.4. Forget about charging your freaking phone every 5 hours. Get this phone, and buy a tablet to have fan ETC.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "An afordable and easy to use smartphone but with limitations", "Author": "Adelis B.", "ReviewID": "R8M1VLXU4TAZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far this phone is everything I expected; its easy to use, has a decent processor, stable software, good camera and lots of apps to download.But it has some limitations I was simply not expecting to see in a new Nokia phone:- The camera despite having a decent quality is has none of the basic options other simpler phones provide, it lacks filters, color modes, and even brigthness adjusment.- The battery life can be kind of short, I don't make many  calls but I do browse the web a lot and this can consume the battery in just 2 days specially if you are using 3G.- The internet browser doesn't display most pages in the most ordely way one would expect and you have very little control over the zoom so you either see the pages from too far or you see them way to close, so much that the text sometimes gets compressed in a very thin column- It doesn't display menu options in spanish, despite being international and having, italian, french and portuguese language packages installed.Another problem I had was that the signal reception is kind of weak, but this One is mostly caused by my current carrier (MOVILNET) here in Venezuela. Aparently some carriers here are not very friendly with unlocked phones some apps that require internet accses like \"Whatsapp\" are not supported or barely suported, I had to change the data packet acces point manually to use internet and still I have a lot of limitations and I will probaly have to move to a more stable but expensive carrier like Digitel or Movistar.ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU CAN CONFIGURE ANY UNLOCKED PHONE YOU ARE GONNA BUY TO USE IT AT ITS FULLEST IN YOUR COUNTRY, READ LOTS OF REVIEWS, AND CONSULT FORUMS, YOU CAN'T JUST PUT A NEW SIM CARD EXPECT EVERYTHING TO WORK FINE SOMETIMES IS NOT THAT SIMPLE.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Toni", "ReviewID": "RGOYH99AOCXU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great, light weight, easy to use, the camera is decent and it is very compact and fits in my pocket.

I'm not passionate to highly sophisticated handsets, such as Ipods, galaxy and similar person. The 'only criticism that I make is not very good sound quality, it sounds dull, as if the caller had a cloth covering his mouth. Curiously, it is the only technology that does not move me the floor. Sorry you did not include in its menu the Spanish language, but I still works well.Definitivamente los NOKIA son otra cosa, este modelo cumple mis necesidades elementales (mensajeria de texto, internet y dem\u00e1s funciones que no he puesto en practica) . No soy persona apasionada a tel\u00e9fonos de alta sofisticaci\u00f3n, como los Ipods, galaxy y similares. La 'unica critica que le hago es la no muy buena calidad de sonido, suena opaco, como si la persona que te llama tuviera un pa\u00f1o tap\u00e1ndole la boca.
