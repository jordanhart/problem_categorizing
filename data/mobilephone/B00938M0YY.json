{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bargain-bin smartphone.", "Author": "Ye Olde", "ReviewID": "RTYT0QVB7G997", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had my LG Oprimus S for about ten months now.  It seemed like a great deal, because I got it free with a new  Sprint account.  Had I known then what I know now, I would have shelled out some dough for a bigger, faster phone.The screen size isnt so bad.  The first major problem is the touch calibration.  When the phone is tilted sideways, the calibration still reads as if the phone were upright.  This causes a LOT of misspelled texts.  Recalibration does not help.The second, and much bigger issue, is the speed of the phone itself.  In the first month, I noticed that it took time to load the photo gallery---sometimes upwards of a full minute, even with just a handful of photos taken.  By a handful, I mean six or seven.  I figured i could live with it, since it didnt happen all the time.Since then, the OS has updated twice.  Each time, the look of the interface has changed, and the phone has slowed down almost beyond usability.  Even when the signal is allegedly 3G, dialing and connecting a call sometimes takes forty-five seconds or more.  Lets hope you dont have an emergency!  The gallery sometimes doesnt even load, and it only reads text input at about three letters per second.  Any faster, and there are holes in the words because youve typed too fast.  Apps that worked fine before now force close repeatedly, and recieving calls while surfing the web crash the phone about one in three times.The last, and biggest issue with the speed lag is surfing the web.  Even in an area with a clear, good signal, the phone can't keep up with touch commands.  Touching a screen might result in the page zooming out, and scrolling doesn't register about half the time, and when it does it is choppy.  Holding the screen to control the scrolling results in non-rrsponsiveness, again about half the time.My tax refund is almost in.

At first I was incredibly pleased with it. The phone was fast, worked great, did everything I could ever need it for. Then at about the 3 month mark, the Camera on the phone just went out. I called Sprint Tech Support, took it into a shop, and scoured online forums to try and find a fix for it. In my searches I learned that this is a common problem with the LG Optimus, and they normally just send you a refurbished phone.After about six months, my phone would not receive text messages or phone calls from certain numbers. I would get phone calls from friends asking why I'm ignoring them, when I had actually never received their messages. The battery lasts 12 hours MAX, so I am charging my phone sometimes twice in a 24 hour period.Overall, the phone worked great for the first 3 months. After that, it's crap. I would go with an HTV Evo or something a little more new instead of this phone.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "For the love of fluffy bunnies, don't get this phone!", "Author": "Rebekah", "ReviewID": "R3GX0XO0B5IZN3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had an LG Optimus S for just under a year now, from Sprint.

When i got this phone, it was when Androids were popular, but most of the phones upward $200, so Sprint and LG decided that they wanted everyone to get hooked on Android, and the only way to do that was, to make affordable ($50) and eventually free one. Now before you go on reading this, if you do today, Amazon is offering every non-iPhone smartphone for free. If it is past then, ignore what I just said. What I am going to do for this phone is give you the pros and cons, which, the cons outweigh. But there are some good pros, and if this is your first Android, it might be just okay.Pros:Free- (That one is the second best pro)Android- What I love about Android is that all the Android phones have the same OS (operating system.) No matter what phone you have, you can still play Angry Birds on it. What the differences are is with the better and pricier phones, it is faster, better camera, etc.Unlimited Data- This is a Sprint only pro, but it is the best pro that you can find.Cons:Bad cameraNo front facing cameraSlowBad MemoryCrashesBad battery lifeSo, as you can see, if you don't do much with your phone, no camera, not a lot of apps, this could be the phone for you.

It's a shame that the internal memory is so small (512 MB) because I love the phone itself (SD capable up to 8GB). It's a perfect size for me and is fully functional. I have had very little problems with it (none that can't be fixed by turning if off and back on) and it has done me well.However, 512 MB is WAY too small for a phone these days! *Especially* with the amount of apps that won't let you run off the SD card. It's not like I got this phone three years ago and it's outdated or anything - it has only been about 6 months and it's still on the market. If you don't plan on using many apps and don't care about the minimal internal memory, then this may be a great and cheap solution for you...but had I known then what I know now, I would have forked out the extra dough to get a phone with a high internal memory capacity.That is seriously the only issue that I have with it. If they would allow the capacity to upgrade the internal memory, I would hands down give this a 5-star review and hang on to this phone for quite a bit longer... but as is, I can't give any higher than a 3 and am currently counting down the time until I am eligible for an upgrade.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great BUDGET smartphone", "Author": "iofs", "ReviewID": "R5GE6EB7HBWSQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone for free through Sprint. I've had it for over two years now and it works great. The only con is it sometimes will restart itself and I have yet to figure out why it does, but this is a rare enough occurrence and the phone was free that I have no complaints. The internal storage is small (165MB) but this is a low end phone. Cpu is pretty weak (800Mhz single core qualcomm if I remember correctly [it does not support Flash]) once more nothing too surprising because it is a low end model. The pros for this phone are: it is put together very well, it has had many drops and my cat likes to chew on phones and mechanically it works perfectly, no cracked screens, no finicky buttons, the back cover has one small crack in the thinnest part of the plastic. The battery life is pretty good, I can surf the internet all day and it will need to charge at the end of the day or with moderate use the phone will last around a day and a half before I will get low battery warnings.Most issues that happen with the phone are software and are usually fixed by powercycling the phone.As long as you realize the limitations of this phone (weak cpu, low internal storage) this phone is great. It takes falls almost as well as my Samsung Rant (darn near Nokia phone durability). If you are thinking about getting a first smart phone this is great to start with. If you are a butterfingers and want a smartphone but don't want to cover $300 in 1/4\" thick rubber, this phone is not going to shatter from a 6' fall (the battery will pop out though).

Cus if it doesnt turn back on you can go get a upgrade- And run the phone over with your car like you've been planning.Battery life- sucks, sucks, sucks. I have to admit right off I am a avid texter- but that's all I ever do. And on thoes days I can charge my phone when it dies, it averages about 3 charges a day (please keep in mind this is from dead to full charge). Also, when I turn on my phone after its been on the charger for about 30 seconds, it says its about 59%- but then it takes 10 minutes to get 3% more- this is true off or on.Storage- for thoes of you who have this phone you laughed when you read 'storage'. This phone is notorious for having little storrage. I have had to delete most of the text threads every two weeks (give or take a day). I use to have to delete apps too- but I don't bother downloading thoes anymore because it was never more then a week before I would have to delete it.Sending messages- this doesn't happen a ton, but its bad enough its getting in here. What happens is, to save battery life I would lock the screen right after to hitting send for a text. Most of the time, it wouldn't send unless I was looking at the text thread. Most of the time, if I didn't have the tread open it wouldnt take more then a day to send. However, one time it took a MONTH to send. It was a important text telling a friend that had missed the last class that the new class had moved across campus. She was very confused getting it at 3am, it had been so long she didn't know what it was spose to be for.Touch screen- the screen will stop working, and since you have to use the touch screen to turn off the phone the only way to turn it off pull the battery.Pretty colors- instead of frezzing the phone might decide to make your screen fuzzy colors. It might look cool for 3 seconds but good luck trying to understand anything you might want to do on it.Thoes are just the things that happen most often, but things like all the icons disappearing, the sceen calibration beibg mest up and so on.

I don't even know how to begin stating all the things i hate about this phone. i'll just start listing: When inserting the charger into the phone, the phone tells me to insert charger, low battery. I've been through three chargers in two years, each one ending the same way; not charging the phone. the os runs so slow and the screen lags with every touch of a button. Sometimes the screen doesn't respond at all to touch. The onscreen keyboard is a joke; the keys are so small a stylus is almost too big to use. and the wifi hotspot aspect does not work at all. I know this phone was free so I probably shouldn't blast it, but I feel like they should be paying me to use this phone. The phone freezes up suddenly and often, and the only way to fix it is to remove the battery and restart it. The upgrades sprint has done to the os hasn't done anything but changed the look of it. The picture gallery chooses when it will load and when it just shows a fuzzy screen. My phone constantly screams it has no more memory, even though there's no extra apps on it and all extras that are on there are stored on my sd card. the internet browser is super ridiculously slow, not even worth using.  It has gotten to the point where I don't even use my phone anymore. I don't really blame sprint's service, because my husband has the evo and never has problems. i do blame them for releasing this crappy phone, even if it was free. my upgrade is in a couple days, and I'm switching to the iOS.

I bought it because it was cheap ($60 no contract) and it shows.CONNECTIVITY PROBLEMS:It has issues connecting to a Wi-Fi network or data from the network. You'll have to troubleshoot that by either turning the phone on/off or letting it switch to airplane mode for about ten seconds. This happens a lot to this particular phone series, look it up.KEYBOARD/TEXTING:The keyboard is really small. Reading the other reviews I didn't think it would be a problem since I have smaller hands, but it is. I always misspell a lot of my words and it sometimes lags when you're typing.

I used this phone for 5+ months, and found out early that its not a phone for gaming or anything that loads heavy ram or graphics. Knowing that and the pho nes internal memory and ram loading memory limits you should be good and free of anymore suprises.  The phones overall performance was great, sound check, playback check, clear calls and text check,durability check...phone can take a beating and still didnt get any dings or scratches. My only issue was its low memory and ram.  Now you can save everything onto an sd card yet, texts, pics, browser, caches, etc those add up and weigh down the available ram.  Other than that, its an inexpensive, versatile, long lasting, competetive, durable, handy little phone  and android accessory.  I highly recommend for someone looking for an upgrade or replacdment or even as a new starter phone.

Ever since then it has been a decent phone for the money and the specs. For the small processor and storage space this phone works great. Very little lag in the UI and with the SD Card expansion the low storage is of no issue. I will have to say though there have been some problems, which is to be expected really with any phone. With android 2.2.2 i had issues with the phone saying it was low on storage even if it wasn't, and with the facebook app not wanting to work. Also the the phone seemed to have \"phantom screen syndrome\" where buttons, links, and scrolling would happen without me even touching the screen. By no means though did this make the phone unusable. Once the phone upgraded to 2.3 the previous problems mentioned where fixed...but now the phone will occasionally restart from time to time but nothing serious. All and all this phone has been great runs things like Netflix, facebook, browsers the internet good. Not sure why people get this phone and try to compare it to the iphone or the samsung galaxy. Obviously those phones are on a completely different level. And even then just like anything they too can have problems and software issues.

So far I had no issues at all from sprint when I first got the phone, but there are sooo many issues now! The first issue I noticed wast the fact that android 2.2.3 caused my phone to glitch alot because it was built more oriented to snapdragon processors, then when I got 2.3.3 it was literally not usable. The touch responsiveness in 2.2.2 felt like a normal heat responsive touch screen, and then when it went to 2.3.3 it acted like it was touch resistant and wouldn't scroll in browsers and would literally lock up and I found a way to downgrade it to 2.2.2 again and did that. Then everything started to do a little better as far as touch sensitivity is concerned. Then I had issues with the camera, I would press the record button if I did a video and it would ding like it was recording then it would just freeze and not do anything and I'd have to take the battery out and reboot it.  Then after those issues, I noticed the processor is only like 653mhz or something close to it I believe, so if you like having apps like angry birds for instance it's gonna either lock up or the touch responsiveness is going to be crap. Oh and you only have 200mb of internal space and alot of apps wont save just on SD and not on the phone so when you download the apps that save onto the phone then that adds up to the space that the apps cache and there's the app data that fills up as well, I used my browser once to check facebook because the android app sucks and after using the slow as can be browser for about 20 mins I already had 5mb in cache and 48mb in data so I had to delete everything then because my phone was creeping by with everything suuuuper slowly!  I've also had issues with the antenna on my phone, or at least that's what the service guy at sprint said it was, I was dropping calls left and right going from 5 bars+3g when I started the call, then half way into the call in the same spot I would have no service then when it dropped the call and returned to the home screen I had 5 bars+3g so everywhere I go I update my PRL and my Profile. Funny thing happened, when I went to sprint about the issue the tech guy took it to the back to \"work on it\" and checked the speed with..... my speedtest app, he declared that I was only downloading at 100kbs and he said that was ridiculously slow for the area we were in and said he could update the PRL and it should be faster and since I had worked at Best Buy Mobile I told him I did the same thing all the time but more power to him if he could do it better, after about 5 mins, idk what took so long because I was the only person there and he was just texting when I arrived, he came out and said \"hmm that's strange, after the PRL update you're only getting 64kbs\" he just looked stunned, I said see it's just as fast as dialup and its like that everywhere. He went on to say \"Since you don't have the sprint insurance, you could pay us 30 dollars to take it apart, 40 dollars for a new antenna, and 10 to put it back together, or 30 dollars for the exact same phone(refurbished) or wait till 2 weeks from now and my specialist will be here and she can look at it, or contact LG with the issue and see if they'll replace it.\" For 1 the first option was ridiculous! 2 the second option was a phone that probably would've done the same thing, and the third option if LG had decided to replace it would've put me without a phone for who knows how long. So I just clock at anywhere from 60kbs(OTA) to 7mbs(home wifi).  All in all I regret leaving verizon because the 69.99 unlimited data plan is a total bust, and the service just sucks! First off the 69.99 unlimited data sounded awesome, then they charge 10.00 dollars for premium data, and in my area in Louisville I had about 20 more dollars in taxes so I pay almost 92 dollars after everything, with sprint roadside I pay 96.44 every month for two flippin years with this crappy phone!
