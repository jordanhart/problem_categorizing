{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I love this phone! *Update 7.4.13*", "Author": "FalseShaddow", "ReviewID": "R2V8YAYM5LA6CC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I hate contracts, as does everyone else. When the Galaxy S3 came out, I knew I was finally going to sign a 2-year deal, because I wasn't going to throw down nearly $700 for an unlocked phone. So as I was finally going to give into a contract, due to the S3 falling in price,and then I heard an announcement for the Nexus 4. I read up on it, I loved the specs, and I was already with T-Mobile so I wasn't planning on using LTE. I had previously vowed never to buy an LG phone, due to owning an Optimus M for MetroPCS. Let me tell you, that was the worst smartphone I have ever owned (out of 5) I still went ahead an purchased the phone.Purchased NOV 13:This was a nightmare, anybody who was waiting for this phone to come out, knows this. I was up at 3 A.M. and I saw that the Nexus 4 sold out in about 20 minutes in Australia and Europe, I knew the US later that day would have the same result. So, 11 A.M. central time rolled around and the sale had started 30 minutes early, and all the Nexus phones had \"Sold Out\", you would refresh the page to find a notice saying \"Coming Soon.\" I was mad. This was so frustrating, I had signed up with Google to receive a notice when the phone would be put up on sale, and in return I got squat. I started to go about my day, disappointed of course. I came back to the Play Store about two hours later, and started hitting the refresh button out of frustration, no other reason. Out of nowhere another 10-15 minute window popped up, for anyone to order this phone. I jumped across my room and grabbed my credit card and successfully placed my order. This was Tuesday, the next day an article came out, saying that people started receiving e-mails claiming that the phone was back ordered and they would have to wait 3 weeks for their phone. I sat waiting, I had a feeling that I would receive the e-mail. Finally, Saturday @ 4 A.M. I got an email from Google, my Nexus 4 had finally shipped from Google. The following Tuesday I finally had my NEXUS 4, and it felt like Christmas morning. The reason I included this in the review was due to the fact that GOOGLE, is a GIGANTIC company, this was such a terrible release for their product. Many people sat in front of their computer like myself saw the \"add to cart\" button, but when they proceeded to check out, all you would get was a constant error. It was so frustrating because here you are trying to give Google your $300, and they couldn't handle the traffic. This is the company who owns google DOT com!!! the company that created Android, the same people who upload 48 hours of videos per minute on YouTube, you get the point. I got a Nexus 4, and I feel like it was pure luck.Finally about the Nexus 4-What I love-* Pure Android Experience: The fact that this phone is made by Google, your phone won't feel outdated anytime soon. Owning a Google phone will assure you that you always have the latest and greatest Android version. In case you're wondering, I enjoy Android and iOS equally, the only thing I can say about Apple is that I can't ever justify spending the $$$ that Apple puts on their products.* the SCREEN: The screen is beautiful, I love the size it's pretty big running at 4.7'' as you probably already know. There's not much more to say*The Price: There is no other phone that can compete with the Nexus 4 and also comes close to its $300 price tag. Dollar for dollar, the Nexus 4 always wins.* x4 1.5 Gz Snapdragon: I love going around saying I have a phone with a quad core processor. I know it's stupid but it makes me happy. Also love having 2 gigs of RAM. I used to use Advance Task Killer App to clear out application and have more open ram. I downloaded it the first day, and every time I cleared running apps, I still had over 1,000 Mb free. So I just went ahead and uninstalled it.*The 3rd Virtual Button: You get 3.5 virtual buttons on your phone. 1-> Return 2->Home 3-> A bunch of squares? 3.5-> Setting/Info. So whenever you press these squares you get all the applications that are open, all you must do is swipe them away and they're gone! I love this feature.*Unlocked benefits: No bloatware, no need to root my phone because I don't any bloatware from T-mobile or ATT, etc...*Gorilla Glass 2: I didn't think this was big deal but after using a week or so, I love the feel of it. You can also Youtube Gorilla Glass 2, and you can see this is some great engineering. I'm probably not going to get a screen protector for a while.*Wireless Charging: I haven't used this yet, but I'm glad it's built in and I will order a charging pad whenever Google creates a pad meant for the Nexus 4.-What I don't love-These cons, are small precise bugs I have found with the phone. These items don't take away the love I have for this phone.*Buttons, lack of: There are no buttons on the phone, they are part of the screen. I know there is a technical term, but I'm tired, so lets just call them virtual buttons. I prefer real buttons so there's more screen space for me to enjoy. For Google's defense, the virtual buttons go away when your watching videos.*Responsiveness: Around 25% when I press the unlock button, the screen will not register my finger trying to unlock my phone. I must press the lock button once or twice then it will allow me to unlock my phone. Some days are better than others. After the phone is unlocked I have NO problems with phone registering my finger movements. This makes me believe it's a software issue.*Sending Pictures: I send a ton of pictures, I have noticed if I have the Wifi on I tend to have failed messages. Turning off the wifi and re-sending the picture tends to fix this issue. I don't know if having AT&T; would change this issue.*Text Messages (This is an Android problem, but it's driving me nuts): Whenever I start a serious texting session, I would say 10-12 outgoing texts a minute, the phone will start giving you alerts saying that the \"Messaging\" App is sending large number of SMS messages. Do you want to allow this app to continue sending message?...Then you must hit ALLOW, for EVERY single outgoing text for a while, until you start slowing down. I hate this, I have to figure out a work around soon.*Screen Capture: Not a big deal but is pretty difficult to capture the screen compared to previous phones. You must press the lock button and lower volume button at the same time. I have noticed I can't always do it on the first try. Grr.Nexus 4 Vs. iPhone 5?Only you can answer this question. It is a preference due to the following reasons.*Price: Do you mind spending $650 for an iPhone, or signing a contract?*Screen size: Some people like myself need a bigger screen, others can't stand big screens because you can't really operate with one hand on top of other reasons. AND some people just can't make up their mind, this may be you!*OS: Do you prefer the iOS or the Android experience, only you can answer this question.*Carrier: If you have Verizon, the Nexus 4 is not for you due to no LTE. If you have T-Mobile you will have to buy an unlocked iPhone.The Nexus 4 is not the best phone out there, it does have its flaws, but at $300 it puts a big fight. I love the value in this phone, and I can't wait to use this phone in the next months to come, when more accessories and phone cases come out.I didn't mention the built in storage. Most people already know it comes in 8gb and 16gb versions, doesn't bother me so I'm not going to talk about it.My previous phone was a Samsung Exhibit III will update this post if I think of anything else.**********Update*********** 12.6.12#1 Dear Amazon customers, we need to get something straight. I encourage people to write reviews for products they love or hate, it really helps people decide whether they should buy something or lets them be aware if flaws found in products. Please understand that when you leave your rating [1of5stars][5of5stars] ect. It should really reflect your opinion of the product itself and not of Amazon or its sellers. The reason why I mention this is because people are giving poor ratings due to the price of Nexus 4, this is not Amazons fault and has nothing to do with the phones performance. People are crying over the price of the Nexus 4, here on amazon. What they don't understand is that the only place you can buy a Nexus 4 for 299 is the Google Play store, the only other way to get it to walk into a T Mobile store, that's it. The phones you are seeing here, are just people who bought if from the Play store, and are trying to resell it for a higher price, just like on ebay. Don't blame Amazon, because they are not the ones selling you this phone for $500, and don't give a 1 star rating, due to something beyond anyone's control.  Amazon is not a Nexus 4 vendor so don't expect a 299 price!#2 Someone asked about the phone heating up. If you start using your phone non stop, after 10 minutes the phone does get warm. I don't consider it hot, but you will notice it.#3 I can't get around this text message warning windows, I have tried other sms apps and still receive this stupid error. Also, pictures are still inconsistent (When I'm not connected to HSPA+).#4 I've noticed when compared my Samsung Exhibit ii, my connection has a harder time connecting to 4g. I've written the percentages of how much time I'm usually connected to 2g, 3g, and 4g. Exhibit ii2g (Edge)=> 25%3g  => 10%4g HSPA+ => 65%Nexus 42g Edge  => 20%3g  => 40%4g HSPA+ => 40%Hopefully this made sense.Sometimes restarting the Nexus 4, raises my connection from 2g up to 4g...I do this when I'm stuck not even being able to load google. I'm considering lowering my rating 4 out of 5...********Update*********** 1.14.13Ok so currently I have 8 cases, the one I love is one that is being sold on Amazon, made by Diztronics. It shouldn't be hard to find because it has so many positive reviews.I have had one instance where my phone was burning hot... I was surfing the metra schedule for chicago. I believe it was the combination of using the GPS, and Data connection on the phone. I haven't felt any heat since then, but it could possible be the case I have on it.Please Please put a screen protector on it. This is my fault, I guess Gorilla Glass 2 isn't as great as I thoughtit was. I usually place this phone by a stone/clay water fountain (Not filled with water). So last week, it slipped and fell probably less than 4 inches. But the screen hit one of the corners of the fountain. Now there is a small scratch on this gorgeous screen. I guess now that I think of it, I should be glad that it didn't crack.My connection hasn't gotten much better, in case anybody was wondering. Also the picture message problem, I was having earlier, I can go 2-3 weeks where all my pictures go through perfectly. Then, I will have one week where I can't send a single one. I don't know what to think about this anymore.For $300 I STILL believe no phone comes close. That's why I'm leaving this phone at 5 stars.************Update*********** 2.24.13Ok so the wireless charger was released a week ago, so I had to order it day one. I love it, I think its super cool. I don't like that the charge time is longer than with a cord, but I knew what I was getting into. The price was $70 after shipping and taxes. This definitely is not a necessity. If the price bothers you at all, please don't get it, because even I don't feel like its worth $70 but regardless I am enjoying it. The only case that I have gotten to work with the charger is the case made by Diztronic, I was hoping that my Poetic bumper would work but it doesn't.I don't believe I have talked about this but Google Wallet is awesome. If you look it up online there are only 10 phones that support this feature. The only con is that there are very few places you can use it. The only big place I have found is my local Walgreens. You put in your Credit Card info in the app and you can pay by touching the Card Reader with your phone. It is awesome and gets everyone's attention.**************Update************* 3.22.13Please don't buy the wireless charger. The phone constantly slides off the charger. I've owned it for over a month I believe and have only really used it the first couple weeks. I rarely use it now because its such a hassle.If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask, I'm constantly checking this thread.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "One device to rule them all :-)", "Author": "Shashank Dabral", "ReviewID": "R1NPTSVM4CN3XA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "** Putting up my review from Nexus-4 16GB since the 8/16gb are listed as separate products **Ever since the concept of smartphones came out, there has been a talk of this so called 'convergence'; Wherein you own one device which can practically do everything under the sun. With the Nexus-4, I think the so called convergence is here, well almost. The only thing that is still lacking is the camera, since I don't see it replacing my DSLR (or even a really good point & shoot). Of course, this shouldn't be taken as a negative point for the phone since I don't think there isn't any other phone which could do the same (The IOS religious fanatics would disagree, but I don't think the Iphone camera comes close to DSLR quality either). Apart from that, the phone does everything does perform rather well in all departments. Jellybean is the best Android flavor so far, the UI is great, the experience is smooth and apps in the google play store are abundant. Battery life is decent, engine horse power is phenomenal (Thanks to Qcom) and the Network data speeds are great. A brief summary of points follows:a) LTE or Not! : The phone doesn't support LTE, but supports HSPA+ which some (T-mobile) still tout as 4G. If you are on T-mobile, getting the phone is a no brainer, since you will get the best speeds that their network can provide. AT&T; is a different story, AT&T; supports both HSPA+ and 4g LTE. It has been stated by multiple reviewers that AT&T;'s LTE is much faster than their HSPA+ network (this makes logical sense since for AT&T; LTE is the latest buzzword and they probably want to promote it over HSPA+). The other fact is that AT&T;'s HSPA+ is slower than T-mobile's HSPA+ network and it is suggested that T-mobile's HSPA+ may be comparable to AT&T;'s LTE. To keep it short, this phone will give you the best experience on T-mobile although you should be able to get decent speeds on AT&T; as well. (The phone won't work on Verizon or other CDMA networks).b) Cost of the phone: I purchased mine from google where it retails for a standard price of $350 (plus taxes and shipping). Some people may compare this price to the contract price of an iphone (or other android smart phones), but that's not a fair comparison. Most contracts factor in the cost of the phone in the plan and by rough estimates an average customer pays around 20$/month for getting the phone subsidized. Multiply this by 24 for a 2 year contract and you are paying 480$ over a 2 year cycle over the initial downpayment of 200$. That's a total price of 680$!! T-mobile for sure gives you a discount if you opt out of the phone and other carriers may have similar plans. The other thing which adds to the your monthly payment is the tax on wireless plans. In the great state of Texas the monthly tax for cell phone plans comes to 17%. So if you have a monthly plan which is higher in cost, you also end up paying higher tax on it. (Compare this with 8% sales tax that you pay when you buy the device up front. Even if you assume that the total cost of the device to the customer is the same, whether purchased via contract or by full downpayment, the contract options leads to a higher tax on the buyer. Ofcourse, the contract plans never really disclose the full picture so you never get to do the maths).c) Connecting to a TV: The Nexus 4 doesn't have a mini HDMI, what it does have is a micro usb which supports slimport. You can buy a slimport HDMI adapter for under 30$ and connect your Nexus 4 to your TV. The other emerging standard is 'Miracast' which would enable one to wirelessly stream the display to a Miracast enabled TV. (Don't worry if you have an older generation TV, the market will be soon be seeing a flood of Miracast adapters which can convert an old TV into Miracast compliant using the HDMI port).Once the connection to TV is sorted out, I think the phone can work as a good replacement to a gaming console or a streaming device. You can play high quality games (and the games on google play are much cheaper than their console brethren)or watch movies/tv on Netflix.The only drawback, there won't be Amazon prime instant videos on this. You can watch Amazon instant videos using the browser of the phone, but Amazon doesn't allow instant videos to be displayed in HD on Android devices. (It does allow that on IOS or custom devices which support the amazon app or on the kindle fire). I guess that's just Amazon's marketing strategy.d) Camera: The camera is decent, comes with an led flash, but isn't something that would blow my mind away.Overall, it's a very good phone at an amazing price point. No wonder it's sold out on google and selling at a premium on Amazon. I will continue updating the review as I spend more time with the phone.

Through out that time I have played around with random Android phones. There is one thing that was just no match for the iPhone and that was the general smoothness. I can now say this is the first Android phone I use that I don't get frustrated with. Android has come a long way. I believe it now on par with the iPhone.Now for a review of the Nexus 4.It is a beautiful device with its glass front and back. The pattern on the back glass is cool but you forget it's there since I rarely look at the back of the phone. I was surprised with how good the rounded edges of the front glass feels, I didn't expect it to make a difference but it does. The device in general feels solid and very well built. Not too heavy not too light. The only thing I didn't like about it is the buttons sometimes feel a little cheap, not a solid click.Software wise it's running the pure google experience with not crazy, sometimes useless, memory hogging add-ons from the carriers, which is a big plus. As I've already mentioned the software is buttery smooth, no lag. Google Now is AMAZING, as long as you forget (ignore) how creepy it is. But I seriously am enjoying it. It tells me when my packages ship, how far im from home or my next appointment, good places to eat, sport scores of my favorite team all this without me telling google to do it.Overall this is an great device.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Phone I've Ever Owned", "Author": "Collin", "ReviewID": "R2XHRS7XF17SN2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did my homework prior to buying this phone and was thoroughly pleased with what I read. My previous phone was a Nexus S, so I was familiar with the Nexus approach to Android. My biggest complaints with my last phone were its sluggishness and limited battery life. Happily, the Nexus 4 suffers from neither of these problems.Pros:Unbelievably fast: the quad-core processor and 2 GB of RAM are certainly noticeableNice size and weight: the screen is large and roomy, without the phone feeling like a tablet and it is very lightElegant design: the phone looks pleasant and professional, with a touch of flairWell-built: it feels very solidCons:Slippery: because the back is glass, the phone can be slippery at times, much like iPhones; however, there is a rubber-like grip around the perimeter of the phone that helpsStorage limitations: there is no slot for expandable storage, which may be a turn-off for some, but utilizing Google's online storage options (like Google Music or Drive) will keep the memory from filling upOverall, I am very pleased with the device and would highly recommend to anyone. The cheap price (typically $300 unlocked) makes this buy definitely worth it.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone with a few things done wrong", "Author": "anton2g", "ReviewID": "R1PKB9KKMBPNP3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using this phone for around a month and these are my first impressions. It is a fantastic phone and would highly recommend it given the great price. There are a few things that could be done better, but overall it is a great phone. To note, I had a Windows Phone before this, and an Android before that.LOOK AND FEEL:This phone feels and looks truly elegant. The front is just a straight black when the screen is off with no buttons to ruin the way it looks. The notification light on the front is a great subtle touch, it looks like the light on the front edge of the Macbook, however I wish the light has a faster blink rate. The small touches are what make this phone feel right, like the slightly curved glass on the front to make the edges feel fluid. The back of the device looks a lot better than it does in pictures, the design is subtle and not tacky. The textured plastic boarder around the edge of the phone makes it easier to hold. A big complaint that I have is that the back of the phone is glass, the only reason for this is aesthetics. Because of this, it is harder to hold and is a lot more slippery. I have even had the phone vibrate/slide off tables because of the glass back. I do not believe the back glass is Gorilla glass since I already have a ton of micro scratches.SCREEN:This device has a great screen. It is big, bright, and very vivid. It has really good viewing angles and the precision on the screen is also superb. Glare is not much of an issue, however finger prints are a pretty big problem. Keep in mind that this is a really large screen and a big device. So, if you have small hands like me, that can be troublesome. I often accidentally hit items on the screen when trying to reach over to the other side with one hand.PERFORMANCE:The phone performs at the top of its league. It is very fast at just about anything you need to do. The animations are very smooth and fast. So far I have not had a hiccup with anything I have asked it to do. The phone responds to my needs so fast that I never end up frustrated. I can ask it for directions while driving and within 15 seconds it will have GPS running and locked and have navigation working and telling me directions, all without ever looking at my phone.HARDWARE:All the pieces inside the phone work great. Great processor, great RAM, great sensors. All of that is good, but its what's missing that sucks. A big headache so far has been the lack of microSD. The phone comes with about 5.5 GB of usable space and that quickly can get filled up with apps and photos. You are basically forced to keep everything you can in the cloud, or else you will never have enough space. Another problem with the hardware is the battery. It is annoying that it is non-replaceable and it is even worse that it doesn't have much juice. If I use the phone conservatively, I can get away with 24 hours of use without fear. But if I want to play games, listen to music, and do normal web surfing and texting then I will be lucky to make it a full day without having to plug it back in. Lucky for me I can charge it at work, so it has not been too difficult to live with this battery. On the brighter side, the hardware for the camera is fantastic. The shutter response is lightning fast and the camera takes fantastic photos.SOFTWARE:Having vanilla Android is not for everyone, but for those that love it, this is the only device to get. It will have the latest and greatest OS when it comes out and it never has any of the taxing skins and applications that providers add on. You really need to try out the devices software if you have never used a vanilla device. It can look slightly different from other Android devices, but at the heart a lot of things are very much the same. The one great feature with this OS version is Google Now. I use it daily, and it keeps track of things that are import for me without me having to set anything up. It can do so many things, that I am constantly finding out new things about it. If you want it to do something, just try asking it and it probably will get it done. For instance you just ask it for directions or to create an appointment and it does it without much effort on your part.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hands on with the Nexus 4", "Author": "A. Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "RUZTS4F93MOCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "And 'hands on' is as good title for my review because I find it hard to take my hands off of it :)Have been using this baby for a couple of weeks already before turning it over to one of our eager kids and my experience has been exceedingly positive.I am not going to restate all the specs and features here because they are widely available but I will try to answer some questions someone considering a purchase may have before actually going ahead and ordering one.Very briefly on the pros: best Android phone in this size and, without actually comparing (hmmm...) apples with oranges, it doesn't take a back seat to anything that 'competition' has to offer, more details in the FAQ section. The major cons I can think of would be the all-glass body being a little bit of a 'fall and break' hazard, the lack of a memory expansion slot so you think long and hard before you decide to go with either the 8GB or the 16GB version and, not a 'con' to me but may be to some, the phone being GSM/HSPA+ only, not LTE compatible.But let's do this in a FAQ format, reflecting my hands-on experience of the past couple of weeks.____________________________________________________________________Q - Is the Nexus 4 a good value?A - Considering that for this price all other high end phones come with a contract that usually means high rates and fees for 2 years, yes, it's a good value.Q - How do I save money if I go 'unlocked' vs. 'contract'.A - The Nexus 7 sells for about what you would pay for a 'contract' phone. With an unlocked phone you can always shop around for the best rate and you can drop your current carrier fore the one that offers the better rate at any time.Q - Would you call its looks 'stunning'?A - To stay objective, I would say that this is one of the best looking phones I've seen yet.Q - Does the lack of LTE compatibility mean that this is a 3G (not 4G) phone?A - No, both LTE and GSM/HSPA+ are considered 4G. LTE may be slightly faster but that's not always the case.Q - Is there an advantage to GSM/HSPA+?A - Yes, if you travel abroad because it's the more popular network outside the US.Q - Which carriers support GSM/HSPA+ in the US?A - The major ones are AT&T; and T-Mobile. Most 'prepaid' carriers support it as well.Q - Does LG is involved in anyway with maintaining/upgrading the phone's software?A - No. This is a Nexus phone. All software updates come directly from Google.Q - How up to date will the phone's software stay?A - Nexus devices tend to be the first in line to get updates from Google.Q - Is there a microSD slot?A - No.Q - Can I charge it through a standard Micro USB cord?A - Yes.Q - Is this a 'pure Android' phone?A - Yes, it ships with Android 4.2 installed and nothing else.Q - Will it allow me to install Amazon's Appstore?A - Yes. You may install any app that runs on Android, including Amazon's Appstore.Q - How does the display compare with other phones?A - I was unable to detect a difference when comparing my Nexus 4 display with the latest iPhone's.Q - Describe 'performance'.A - I didn't try 'everything' but everything that I used on the phone so far performed without a glitch or a hiccup.Q - Describe call quality.A - Based on my experience so far, the Nexus 7 operates well as a 'phone'. I can hear the other party loud and clear and I've had no complaints yet of them not hearing me well.Q - Is the Nexus 7 future proof?A - Nothing is but considering its beautiful design, high quality manufacturing, the near guarantee of timely software updates, the fact that it is leading Android phone today for the under 5\" screen size and that the smart phone technology is approaching 'maturity' it should continue to be a good phone for at least the next 2-3 years.____________________________________________________________________-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "One of the top phones out now", "Author": "Danimal", "ReviewID": "R11NAH61MZV66P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Put simply, the Nexus 4 is one of the top phones out right now.The curved edges sound gimmicky, but it really does make swiping off the edge of the screen easier (switching home screens, navigating apps, any time a swipe is used, really).This is a 'Nexus' phone, which means you'll stay up to date with Android updates for as long as it can handle them. Other phones get updates when the manufacturer feels like updating, which usually means that a year after you get the phone, it's out of date. Not so with Nexus phones. You also get to skip the software skins added by other manufacturers (such as TouchWiz, Motoblur, etc). This means a faster, better Android experience.This phone looks stylish, and the glass on the back is a nice touch. It's probably more likely to crack if you drop it, but with a case on it that shouldn't be an issue.This phone has the fastest processor of any current phone (Snapdragon S4 Pro), and has the fastest graphics (Mali 400). This makes everything you do super smooth, and apps load and run perfectly.You also get wireless charging capability built in, but you'll need to get your own wireless charging mat.Unfortunately, 8gb of space is pretty limited (even 16gb is kind of low), and there's no microSD slot to add more. Then again, my last phone had 8gb and I never used that up. With Google Music (which allows you to upload unlimited music to Google so you can access it anywhere), Drop Box, and other cloud storage services, it's not too hard to find ways to handle your data, even if you do use up your 8gb of space.The screen on the Nexus 4 is probably the best there is right now. Super high resolution, and the color quality is perfect. If you're used to a Samsung phone, the colors may seem a little dull in a direct comparison (most Samsung phones have heavily over-saturated displays), but really they're more accurate, and the contrast is still top-notch.The sound quality is very good. Can't really expect more than this from a smartphone. It may not be the best of the best, but it's still very good for phone calls or listening to music or game audio at modest volumes.For the size, this phone is relatively light and thin. Not the lightest, not the thinnest, but still better than most, and light and thin enough to be pocket-able and comfortable in your hand.Another minor con is the lack of a 'user serviceable' battery. Phone batteries now last at least a couple years so this shouldn't be an issue, and if your battery does start to die, you just need to unscrew 2 screws to replace the battery (doing so will technically void your warranty, however), so it's not a huge issue.Being a Nexus phone, you also get the best developer community working on development for the phone. If you want to flash custom roms, run the latest betas, or customize your phone a lot, this is definitely the phone you want.Basically, if you're going to get an Android phone and you want the best there is, this is a great choice.

They are marketing terms to sell to some of the dim witted public. It's the speed that counts. When they pick up a sliver of speed of speed, wait for 5G and Super LTE + terms to rear their heads. It's all BS.A snippet of a review:In speed tests conducted by PC Magazine, T-Mobile's HSPA+ 42Mbps 4G network beat Verizon's 4G LTE network in 11 cities. What does PC Magazine think about T-Mobile's HSPA+ service? \"It's really fast, covers a lot of the country and is inexpensive,\" says the publication. Taking it even further, PC Magazine says that with this type of speed available to its customers, the nation's fourth largest carrier doesn't really need an  LTE network except to have the additional spectrum and for marketing purposes. Anyone who thinks that T-Mobile's HSPA+ 42Mbps network doesn't belong in the same conversation as LTE should probably take a look at the numbers", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "An outstanding smartphone at the absolutely right price-point (updated)", "Author": "Abhinav Agarwal \"AA\"", "ReviewID": "R28Y3KDJRG9ZBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For this stunning a phone, the only drawback of consequence is the fragility of the screen.Update (Jun 9, 2013):Some notes after further using this phone:- The battery won't last you from morning to evening if you have 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS running on it with a couple of background apps like email, Twitter, and if you use the phone for more than a few minutes of call. You will need to recharge the phone by afternoon.- Despite the promise of no bloatware, there are some Google apps that run on the phone that you cannot kill or choose to stop. Like Google search, google mail, YouTube, Google Talk, etc... Kill the task, stop the process, and they pop right back on.- Camera: the camera app that ships is in dire need of fixing. No complaints with the photos or videos, but the camera has this habit of pulsating every few seconds; it goes out of focus and back into focus every three seconds, and drives you absolutely nuts.Rest of the review:Having used smartphones since 2010, and having experienced the LG Optimus LG 540 (the worst phone I have used in 15 years), which cost Rs 11000, and the Samsung Galaxy Y (a very good bargain for the price), which cost Rs 7,000, using the Google Nexus 4 (manufactured by LG) was quite stunning a difference. For a phone that is less than half the price ($299 for the unlocked 8GB version) of an unlocked iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy S4, this phone offers virtually the same feature set.Pluses:+ Quad-core processor, 2GB RAM (yes, two gigs), and a gorgeous 1280x768 screen at 316ppi. The iPhone 5, by way of comparison, offers a 640x1136 display, at 326ppi, and the Samsung Galaxy S3 offers a 720x1280 display at 306ppi. Both the iPhone 5 and S3 have 1GB RAM. In the 2+ months of usage, I have never had memory usage exceed 1.3GB.+ Display: the display is uniformly even to touch, and a light gesture or tap is all that is needed.+ Performance: I have not had any lag when using the display, nor have I yet seen the screen freezing. I have played games and movies, all without issues. Apps start fast, and even graphics-heavy apps like games work without any lag, jitter, or abruptness.+ Upgrades: since this is the base Android experience, with no carrier or vendor skins overlain, I get Android updates as soon as they are available.+ No crapware: again, since this is the base Android install, I do not have any unwanted apps that I cannot uninstall or stop. I have installed the free AVG AntiVirus free app and use that to monitor performance as well as running apps and their memory usage.+ The camera can produce gorgeous images. Especially in bright light I see very, very little difference between the images the Nexus 4 produces and what most point-and-shoot cameras can produce. I have not used my P&S; since this phone. And did I mention it can also shoot 1080 quality video?Minuses:Three, perhaps four, drawbacks basically, and in order of their severity, are:1. Screen fragility. Every single review I have read has drawn attention to the fact that this is an all Corning Gorilla glass display, front and back, and can crack if dropped on a hard surface. Apart from being gentle when using the phone, I have also purchased a cover for it. The fragility of the display is the single biggest drawback of this phone, IMO. If you don't drop it, and don't crack it, woohoo!2. No expandable memory: If you buy the cheapest Nexus 4, it costs $299, and comes with 8GB of onboard memory, of which only about 6.5GB is available for your apps and storage. Since there is no expandable memory slot, you are stuck with what you get with the phone. You have to shell out an extra $50 to get an extra 8GB of memory, i.e. $349 for 16GB, and that too when you buy the phone. If after buying the phone, you decide you need more storage, tough luck. This sort of sucks, but, again, if you plan on making extensive use of the cloud to store files that are large, then you can live with this limitation. Given that additional storage is so cheap - you can get a 32GB micro SDHC card for under $30, it would have been nice to have the option of a SDHC card. Not good.3. No replaceable battery. If you end up using the phone beyond what its battery will last, then you basically have to junk the phone, since the phone cannot be opened to replace the battery. Bummer.4. No LTE: Here in Bangalore, while 3G service has been available for a couple of years, Vodafone is unable to provide even reliable 2G connectivity where I live, so picking lack of LTE in the Nexus 4 as a negative is a meaningless quibble. Of course, if in your area 4G is available and offers its promised 20+mbps speeds, then this is a more important feature than it is for me.In summary, initial impressions over the first two months of usage have been very favorable. Of course, its longevity remains to be seen, and if it can last two or more years without breaking down, it will have been the best phone I've owned.

The nexus 4 is alot like this.I bought two of these phones an 8 gb and 16 gb version.  As soon as I made my first call the problems arised.  There was static/buzzing in the earpiece.  So I go online and find out (despite the amount of five star reviews) that this is a common problem.  It seems like you can hear the processor even when not on a call.  I tell my self fine, it isn't the end of the world it is not too loud.Then the bluetooth problem came.  Granted mine wasn't as bad as alot of others but I always had difficulty syncing my phone with my car.  I would have to enable/disable bluetooth, re-pair etc.  Bluetooth in my car is important so I decide to use my free upgrade and get a galaxy s4 (I was originally going to sell whatever upgrade I got basically making the google phones free).  In all honesty the galaxy S4 didn't pair always that great either (come to find out my bluetooth is glitchy, car has now been replaced), but also online people complained about the nexus 4 and bluetooth.At this point I'm kicking myself in the butt thinking maybe I jumped the gun when it could have been my car the whole time.  Then it happened...My wifes phone would die with 27% battery remaining and the time would not update.  We had to reset the phone to get it to work.  Needless to say she also got a galaxy (S3).Outside of those problems listed above we liked the phones because it was easy to use as our first android phones and had a bunch of useful features (was less complicated then the galaxy), and was a no contract phone, so we didn't have the bloat ware on it.

The Sensation was a great phone.... when it worked. HTC had some quality control issues with that one. I finally broke down after my third replacement, after nearly two years of uneventful use, crapped out in just a couple of weeks, and ordered a brand spanking new Nexus 4 from the Google play store. (Sorry, I wasn't about to be used and defiled by the Amazon seller) Since I run my business on my phone I had to have something a bit more stable, so I purchased the 16 gig version of the Nexus 4. I had an 8 gig SD card on the Sensation, it was adequate, barely. So I think the 16 gig will fit the bill.I use my phone mostly for business. I invoice, set appointments, use it as a GPS and of course take and send emails, tons of business texts and use it as an actual phone. The Nexus excels in all of this. In fact I was blown away by the new google service, today I received an alert telling me that I should start heading to my next calendar appointment since I was currently 30 min away. A phone that doesn't just alert me at a set 15 min before an appointment, but gauges my current distance to what I have planned. In my book, that feature alone makes it worth it. I research and order over the internet with ease, the connection is plenty quick to access the web over the T-Mobile service and do what I need. The speaker is very loud... now considering I am comparing this to the weak speaker of the Sensation, you can take that with a grain of salt. However, I find it almost too loud and tend to quiet it down a bit. I can use the speaker phone for business calls, something that was agonizing with the Sensation. One of only two negatives that I have found so far is that the phone dialer in the stock software is weak. The Sensation used the T9 protocol and was very easy to use. The stock dialer on the Nexus is not intuitive. This however was quickly remedied by a search of the app store. I currently have two separate dialers I am evaluating, one more like the stock HTC version, the other packed with a bunch of features, but a little more clunky when it comes to making calls.I have read plenty of people underwhelmed by the camera of the Nexus. Compared to a Leica M9, sure the little point and shoot on any phone sucks. I don't actually buy a phone looking for a camera, even the venerable iPhone doesn't really have what I would consider an awesome camera. It's like comparing different really bad smells, sure some are less bad than others, but they all smell bad. The Nexus 4 has a decent camera. It actually controls the flash a bit more than most any other camera on a phone that I have used. The colors seem somewhat natural and in good light it does a decent job of focusing. For business use it works just fine. I can snap a quick photo of an item to be restored with a decent amount of detail for any client to clearly see what I am going to work on. Snap shots of the kids are fine, in low light it tends to back focus. It is a decent camera. A little better than the sensation's in some ways.For the few games I have, such as Temple Run 2, it runs smoothly and shows off its nice big screen. There is never a bit of lag switching between apps. I have about 280 songs downloaded onto the device. I know this isn't a ton compared to some, but it is enough to keep me entertained on a long drive and I still have plenty of space to spare on the device. After loading everything up the way I want I still have about 10 gigs of memory left. Other than snapping a few photos and syncing those with DropBox, I don't see myself using a whole lot more of the memory.The size of the phone is absolutely a positive in my book. I am only 5' 6\" so as you can imagine I have short stubby fingers on small hands. I have no trouble using the phone one handed. Maybe I am just conditioned since the Sensation also has a large screen. The Nexus's screen is even larger still, being a little wider. I find the screen size a definite positive, it makes surfing the web and viewing photos that much easier. The pixel density is excellent. I love the smooth look and crispness. I have read that the screen isn't as bright as an iPhone 5's. Well, since I use the phone with the screen less than half as bright as its max and I find it plenty bright, I figure this is subjective. Sure 60 lights in a small room will be brighter than 50, but both will blind you... if you get my meaning.As to the battery life... it sucks. This would be my other negative. At least with the Sensation I had two extra batteries (It's battery sucked too.) When I got low on juice I would just snap in another battery and away I would go. This is not an option with the Nexus 4. I have been careful to plug it into the car charger every time I have to drive anywhere and I find that I am a bit more careful how I use the phone so that I can go the entire day without having to worry. This leaves me with about 60% or a little less of battery left after a 10 hour work day. However if I am doing any intensive surfing of the web it can drop a bit lower and require a top off. When I start running that quad core processor with the screen on, I can watch my battery widget tick down with a belch. Solution: buy a back up battery. I am just looking around for the best solution... a 10,000 rated brick or a 3200 deal I could stick in my pocket. That is the question.I haven't noticed the back heating up excessively, my Sensation seemed to get a lot hotter when I used it heavily, so maybe I am used to that sort of thing. I have a case on the phone as well, so that deadens how much heat I can actually feel. I have a screen protector on as well... sure it doesn't feel as nice, but with how much I am hauling this thing around, I would be begging for problems if I didn't take precautions. All in all I love the phone. For $350.00 it blows away phones in the $600.00 range and competes very well with the others. It's really a no brainer. (I ordered my Nexus 4 at nearly midnight Saturday, it arrived Wednesday morning. Given Sunday was not a business day, I found the service quite prompt even though the Play store was giving me a shipping date two weeks out.)Edit April 16, 2013So after a months use I have to say my initial impression of the battery is a little misleading. The battery performance is actually descent. Easily lasts a full day and like all my other smart phones it requires to be plugged in over night. I believe the meter is just honest. When you have 50% left you are actually half way to empty. As many hours as it took to get there is as many hours as you have left. On my Sensation 50% meant you had an hour maybe an hour and a half of use left. So you can imagine I got a little freaked out when the Nexus 4 hit 50% or bellow. It actually isn't that bad and I haven't purchased and external battery for it. I may not.Also I did have the infamous buzzing coming from my ear speaker while surfing the web and such. Called up Google and had a replacement a few days later. The replacement is perfect not a single buzz. I am just as happy now as when I first bought it.Edit: September 17,2013So I have red so much on how fragile this phone is and how it will break if you look at it wrong. Well that may be if you don't have a case. However, I have dropped this thing over and over without a single crack. Lesson: put a case on your phone. I have one with a clear back and it almost looks like there is no case on it. I've been so impressed with this phone that I'm actually excited to get the Nexus 5.

Yanes \"ChowKaiDeng\"", "ReviewID": "R2TTSBPZF8R1ZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are pretty much Android users in my home, including a Nexus 7 tablet. After 28 months, our cheap Android phones started to die, so we decided to buy a couple of Nexus 4. This is my review after a week of use. Before I begin: Please notice the price of this phone and compare it with most recents Samsung or iPhone high end models.DESIGN: The experience so far has been great: the phone is lightweight, sleek and elegant.- Feels great on the hand (even with the Ringke Slim case we bought).- Buttons are well placed and are easy to reach and press.- In general, the screen size is perfect for reading, browsing, playing or any other regular mobile tasks. A little piece of advice: if you have small hands, maybe will be a better idea to purchase a smaller phone, like the Galaxy S3 mini, which is in the same price range.- If you use a screen protector (like the Halo Screen Protector Clear), the rounded edges of the screen won't be entirely covered by the protector; it's not a terrible thing, but it will impair the experience while swapping websites in Chrome. Other than that, most of the apps doesn't need to go completely to the edges in order to swap.HARDWARE: This phone is absolutely fast, no lag at all doing any tasks.- Screen is very responsive and for our use (mainly work tasks) the 8GB version is more than sufficient (we are packed with sync apps like Evernote, Pocket and Drive, and docs of all sorts, and still have 3GB free).- Colors and screen brightness are pretty good. Resolution is perfect for HD videos, and just simply keeps reading texts completely clear. I love the proximity sensors that turn off the screen while making phonecalls and the auto brightness that dimes the screen acording to the ambient light intensity.- Speaker is not that great, but I hate playing music or videos out loud anyways. If you use external speakers, sounds perfect.- If you are planning to load the device with music, maybe the 16GB (about $30 more) version will suit best your needs.- Camera is great for daylight pictures, but not so great for night pictures, but this is a common problem with mobile cameras. Of course, it has a led flash that does a great job for dark ambients and also can be used as a flashlight/lamp.- Charger is pretty much the same style as the Nexus 7, which is a USB cable and a small converter for the wall sockets (Nexus 4 converter is smaller then the Nexus 7). The most important here is that the USB cable is about 8 inches (20 cm) longer, which is great since the Nexus 7 cable was just too short. Note: It is not recommended to interchange the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 7 chargers, at least not on a daily basis... though it will work.- Connection speed: I live in Venezuela and we have one of the most crappy Internet connections in the continent, no matter what device you have, so I can't review this. But I can assure you that the phone works as expected compared to other high end mobile devices.BATTERY:Battery life is not great but is not awful. I'm a heavy mobile user and I take 1h bus roundtrips to work, every day. Then I keep using the phone for browsing, texting and taking notes along the day, and when I get back home at night, I always need to charge it. The good news is that it charges very fast (less than 2h from 10% to 100% with the screen off). Nevertheless, considering that the charger is very small, It's always a good idea to keep it with you and put it to charge from time to time in your desk or just plug in it to your USB port on your PC (though it charges slower). I always keep and extra USB cable at the office to charge my Nexus 4 or Nexus 7.SOFTWARE: for me, this is the best mobile OS on the market.- As I said before, I own a Nexus 7 (we also have a 10 inch ASUS ePad Transformer tablet), so I'm pretty familiar with it. After comparing Android 4.2.2. / 4.3 with iOS 6.x, Android absolutely kicks his ass in every way: it is more customizable, elegant, clean and intuitive. With iOS you just have to keep the things as they come and rearrange your digital ife around it, but with Android you can get a more personal experience with the device. I'm not saying that iOS 6.x it's a piece of crap, it works great and does its job, but I feel they have not made any important changes over the years and its features are very basic compared to Android. I could write a very extensive review just to highlight Android features over iOS (I don't have any recent Windows Mobile experience to include), but I can resume it saying that Android allows you to do more and in a more intuitive way.- Voice commands works great: you can dictate, search, ask or make phonecalls very easy and fast.- Most important: this phone has a \"pure Android version\", which means it has NOT been pre-packed with tons of useless Apps or ugly interfaces that most of the Android mobile phones manufacturers tend to do.- As always: Google Play store has just any app that you'll need, free or paid.- For Google users: syncing is just great, not just with Gmail, but with any other Google application.- Sugestions: in order to get more of your interface, install Apex Launcher (free or paid versions on the Google Play) which allows you to customize your desktop and add pretty usefull gestures to control the device.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery SUCKER, but......", "Author": "Fred Keezer", "ReviewID": "R30C9W0OFRIX4K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off i am a field technician for a subsidiary of a major wireless carrier, my company just offered this unit this year i got it before it went public, my company only charges 139.00 for the unit with a contract. Having said that i used to work for RF engineering in the Seattle area and did extensive data gathering with many, many handsets. I have grown to really like this phone and will give you some pro's and cons regarding it.Pro's...Fast processor with stock os applications. the Stock applications work very well, they are a bit bland but functional. when i started loading down apps to the handset like Go Launcher, Go SMS, Go dialer, Go keyboard, Go contacts, i ran into a few glitches. one is if you have a number contact that has extensions associated with them and pauses, the go dialer wont work correctly. I simply touch the stock phone icon, look up the contact and use that when i need the pauses, code numbers and extensions input automatically. this is more of an issue with the third party android app than the phone itself.Has a decent radio but like all smart phones has a tendency to want to lock on to 4g coverage even when its not even possible to make a call, necessitating you to manually put it in 2g only mode when in a rural area without 4g so you can make a call...beware i told you so.It has shown no issues of blue tooth syncing like some have experienced, it sinks automatically in my company ford f150 pretty much every time, if not, i simply push the sync button on the steering wheel and say \"phone\"...it connects and i am on my way.When you start filling it up with apps, there ends up being a lot of apps that think they need access to your gps location services but don't. this just eats up the battery when you allow all these apps to access that. there is a new function available in the 4.3 jelly bean upgrade that just came in that will allow you to individually deal with each app and its permissions. its called app manager and it works. it access the Ap ops system in your os and allows you to turn on or off all permissions associated with the app in question. nice function.Cons...1.SUCKS the battery. i can use it for 4-5 hrs and get down to 25% of battery use left if not careful. if you put it in sleep mode (push button on right hand side of handset) you turn off the screen and save batt life. also turn off wi-fi when not using it and also bluetooth when at home or not in car, that saves energy as well.2. No way of changing battery, its internal. you cannot open up the unit. this sucks, but i have yet had a need to do a real hard reset to factory default config due to issues or glitches. I have just purchased and am waiting to get the NO-LEMON battery case that doubles the battery life of this handset. Most people wont like the bulky size, but i like big and sturdy not thin and flimsy anyway.3. No SD card slot for memory expansion. not sure why they neglected this being that it only has 8gig of hd space, i have 2 gig left and only about 200 songs on my handset. most people have way more than that, so this could be a deal breaker for many people. i think the lack of an SD allows more stability for the os to work and function correctly.4. Sound is crap from handset external speakers. my blackberry sounded way better than this unit and it was over 5 years old.Even though i listed more cons then pro's i would recommend this phone over other handsets out there being that it is a quad core processor, has stock android with no carrier firmware embedded, and is actually a great smart phone if you can live with some limitations like no SD card and no ability to replace the battery when it craps.

Nothing seemed to work. Switched to a galaxy s 3 and love it.A couple other points I will make. I bought the phone for my wife, but the stock android on the nexus 4 certainly isn't as refined or pretty as the customized Android you find on the GS3 for example. So for hardcore users, the stock android experience is probably fine, even desirable, but for my wife she hated it because it wasn't as user friendly for her. Got her a GS3 instead as well.Price is certainly right for the Nexus 4 and no contract with T-Mobile is the bomb.Technically, the nexus 4 is capable of 4G LTE on T-Mobile but you need to root your phone and install a developer's OS and change your radio settings. But it works if you are technically savvy. Many articles on developer websites on how to do this.

There's also a lot of photo editing apps in the play store- Unlocked so works well with tmobile pre-paidCons - I have trouble with the GPS every now and then. Whenever i use google maps it says \"Searching for Satellites\" and the navigation does not work well. After googling around this appears to be a known issue with android. Not sure if other folks have experienced this- Microphone is a little weak. No one can hear me when I put people on speakerphone. This is a problem for me since i make a lot of calls from my car. I use a bluetooth headset instead now- Minor glitches when trying to unlock the phone. It does not always work right away- Battery life is abysmal. Granted i am moderate to heavy user. I barely get through the day without having to charge it repeatedly.Despite these flaws, the prestine android experience coupled with the very reasonable price and the ability to use on cheap pre-paid plans like tmobile since the phone is unlocked makes this phone a winner for me.As for tmobile itself, the plan is cheap and get's reasonable speeds on HSPA+, but coverage can definitely wary depending on where you live/travel with this phone, so your experience may differ.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like nexus 4", "Author": "Garegin ghukasyan", "ReviewID": "R3U999KFVAZIPI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've got this product in time (though fedex made some confusion).

So advice to anyone that has problems with there Google product... return it and don't agree to an exchange! I should also note that I am, or at least was, a very happy nexus 7 owner until my difficulties with the 4 have changed my opinion on the nexus products and Google themselves. I figured the company with the slogan \"don't be evil\" would understand my difficulties and frustration, since they are noted on my account, and would have helped me get a nexus 5 with some sort of deal, since I have had all these troubles or at least come up with some practical alternative that would help me get a working phone.... I should back up at this point and note that my nexus 4 is just about as useful as a brick at this point and I am stuck shopping for a new phone after only 8 months of ownership.I know a few other people with this phone and some would say that it is a great phone and I would have agreed with them it mine worked as well as my N7 tablet. My 1 star rating has to deal with this product as much as the Google costumer. I hope this helps future buyers of Google products!

That price, for a full-featured, reasonably high end, well specified, unlocked Android phone was amazing. I bought one immediately after that price drop and I'm glad I did, because Google ran out of inventory in mid-September, and is unlikely to replenish stock, with a new model (the Nexus 5?) almost certainly on the way.This phone is terrific, is well built, feature laden, and combined with a 30 USD / month T-Mobile plan (100 minutes of talk, unlimited texts and data, at T-Mobile's 4G speeds - but not LTE), offers the best value in cell phones today.Pros: + Just the right size and weight, not too big, not too small. I've used an iPod Touch (4th & 5th gen) extensively too, and those definitely feel, and look, a little too small now. The screen on the Nexus has better resolution (1280x738), and is significantly larger (4.7\"). Having said that I wouldn't want a phone larger than the Nexus - it would become cumbersome. + Google Maps has replaced my GPS navigation devices completely. The Nexus is an ideal size for this. + Everything just works, as expected. + Very responsive: the quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM probably help here. I haven't seen any lag, except in Chrome on complex and high-content web sites, where I've seen similar lag even on mid/high end desktops. + Highly reliable: I've rebooted it once in a month (and that was only after a lot of application installs (about 100) and lots of configuration changes during initial setup over the first couple of weeks. I'd reboot the iPods equally frequently after large changes. + Packed with features, see the Google site: [...]Cons: + The camera, while having a decent 8MP resolution, has sub-par color rendition, and doesn't perform in low-light as well as the Apple cameras (on the 4S and the iPod Touch) + Notifications on an unlocked screen (e.g. news bulletins, appointments and email and text arrivals) are not managed as well as on the Apple devices, although there are Apps that help with this e.g. LightFlow. After a month of occasional tweaking, I still see more useful alerts and news bulletins on the iPod than I do on the Nexus (even with the same news and email accounts configured). + The battery barely lasts a day with light to moderate use. I have BatteryGuru installed to help with this, and I'm careful with screen brightness, background apps, GPS/WiFi/Bluetooth usage etc. Most of the time this is OK for me, I keep it charged when in the car, and occasionally connect it to my laptop to charge when at work, but this would be an issue if I were hiking in the wilderness much.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A well made device with amazing performance at an affordable price", "Author": "Mariam Barseghyan", "ReviewID": "R3FLZSL0W7N7MD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like the phone.

I've had this for few months now.There is huge community that helps with development of Custom ROMs and Kernels, and that covers up flaws that Nexus 4 has.....Since its one of the few first generation quad core phone, with small battery it does run out quite fast even with Google trying to help with it by throttling the speed of phone when heated. So far CM+Franco Kernel was the best Battery saver for me, but if you find better combination please comment below.Another Flaw is the Navigational bar, which can also be fixed with any Custom ROM. Not all apps in the market is built to Google's new design guides. A lot of apps don't have the three dot buttons(Essentially a menu button). The virtual bar does pop up a small one on the side if it detects there isn't one, but trying to find where these things are in each app can get annoying. Again I am running CM with Menu button on my Virtual bar, but most of the time I have expanded desktop with LMT launcher(which is just Pie control in app form) on... that allows me to have other apps in short cut when I bring it up.Speaking of Virtual navigation... it does take up considerable amount of screen like I said above, most ROMs will give your ability to get rid of it or make it smaller. Paranoid Android ROM is great at this, but Battery life needs to be sacrificed a bit to use it.TLDR : I can be THE BEST PHONE EVER, IF your adventurous enough to use Custom ROMs and Kernels.", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Dan Reznik", "ReviewID": "R3NY324WV8CD1Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best phone I ever had.

Must clean regularly.2. the phone has a big gap on the top between the bezel and the screen, this is the design to make room for speaker, dust gets trapped in there very easily and if you do not clean it can eventually travel under the screen itself.3. the speaker on the back is easily muffled by just setting the phone on a flat surface or on your bed etc. so sometimes it rings very low because its being blocked. i think this was a design flaw. you would normally have to set it on its face to hear it ring properly in a noisy room.4. the speakers sounds are horrible and sometimes distorted if they are loud.5. music volume level is pretty low you cant really listen to your music as loud as you could on an ipod or any other music device.Pros:1. battery life is very good, way better battery life I ever got on my iphone2. the screen is superb, i really like the extra screen space and the vibrant color display3. get the latest android on your phone always before all the other models.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good experience", "Author": "Mario Jesus Guadarrama Jimenez", "ReviewID": "R1ANRS3FICON6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good experience, just in time, totally accomplish my expectations and, the only thing was that i had to pay for the shipping, have to be more cheap", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful mobile device.", "Author": "Paulo Sacchetto", "ReviewID": "R269F7KFNKAVUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Optimal cost and benefit.Very beautiful, very light and thin.Fast and with a beautiful screen.Certainly a great buy.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Keith rock", "ReviewID": "R1WU9WHPHEW7DY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the nexus 4 is a great phone it's OS operates smooth, camera (to me) is awesome, the look and feel is beautiful.

This is a competitive phone.  The Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One are all out with their awesome specs--but they are all 600 dollars.  This phone is still competitive at half the price, plus you get the goodness of the unvarnished Android 4.2.2 (soon to be 4.3) experience without all the Samsung/HTC bloatware.

I personally have a Galaxy S3 issued from work--a great device, but if I had to go back to my own plan I would buy this.

I tested this against my old Samsung galaxy 2, and it took a good 10 minutes to do the same thing.The screen is rounded so screen protectors are a little hard to install. I kept ending up with \"raised\" edges of the screen protector because it wasn't centered and aligned perfectly. If your OCD this may bug you. But the screen is also concaved, which prevents scratchs from occuring if you lay it facedown. Mind you if you slide the screen against a gravel surface, this wont do any good, but in most cases it does.The one thing it lacks is any SD card. If you're thinking, I'll pop mine open and install my own additional/large memory. Think again. The memory is intergrated into the processor. There is no way to expand the storage on this phone. Google - Please don't go the way of apple and try to squeeze every penny from your customers. We will hate you for it and will bail on you the moment you fall behind.

I have done so - the one I picked was called \"DW dialer\". But the fact that this is not part of the basic android indicates the developers aren't really thinking about this as a phone.2.) NO FILE BROWSER - There also doesn't seem to be a look at your files function in the \"stock\" apps. Amazing that they consider this a data device and forgot to give us \"easy\" access to the file structure. Again there are work arounds - where you can download file managers/viewers from the play store (\"astro file manager\" was the one I ended up picking), but quite beyond comprehension this was overlooked.All that whining on my part aside, it is a really good phone in terms of voice quality, maps with GPS, taking pretty good photos, doing data stuff \"lickey split\" on the t-mo network, setting up a personal wifi hot spot, playing music from pandora, amazon, grooveshark, etc. The only thing I would have \"desired\" beyond that is for it to be a \"tough phone\" (e.g. water and dust proof).Random Side Note - the phone is not compatible with the chromebook (e.g. the google laptops). It is recognized as a USB device on windows and macs. But not by its fellow \"google\" product. But if you really believe in the \"cloud\" this should not be a problem. I can access my google files from either device pretty easily.Also note - if you have a traditional sim card, you will need to get a smaller micro sim.", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "4 stars", "Author": "Sebastian Alvarez", "ReviewID": "R2N9YWRM91L34U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ive been 1 month with phone, everything run fast, open fast, no lags or hangs, I like very much android 4.2.2 and google services.

Original review below.----------I'm a regular iPhone user, but I always own the latest greatest vanilla Android so I can keep my knowledge fair and equal. I've owned every Google vanilla phone since Google started with the Nexus One. This hardware with the latest OS is the first time I've felt really comfortable and ready to switch. The apps I use are also finally usable enough and in the right place that I could do it with little heartburn.Because this phone and the previous phone, Galaxy Nexus both support the latest edition of Android OS, my main objective is to tell you what I like about this phone better. It's simple-- the edge of the phone has a really nice bevel to grip it. The Galaxy Nexus has a pretty smooth edge which requires you to \"cup it\" in your hand and sometimes use two hands is easiest. This phone has a nice bevel to keep it gripped in the hand so there is no issue holding it.From a performance perspective I should notice a marked increase from the Galaxy Nexus but I'll be honest-- this is not something I noticed. It may be that I simply didn't use in extreme ways to prove this difference.That all being said, in my opinion this is superior hardware experience to the Galaxy Nexus, but I wouldn't hesitate to go with the Galaxy Nexus if cost is an issue/focus.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything and more.", "Author": "MavsFan6", "ReviewID": "R2YBYRLR649FQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "iPhone fanatics say their devices are \"simple\", we call our devices \"more advanced\".

I love new gadgets and I love anything related to technology. With that said, when the Nexus 4 was announced it intrigued me. I've tried Android about 2 years ago on a Galaxy S phone and wasn't impressed. I wasn't sure if it was the operating system itself or the experience that was given through the Galaxy S phone.When the Nexus 4 became available again on the PLAY store I decided to order a 16 GB model. For only $50 more I felt it was worth the upgrade. The phone arrived on Monday, February 4th. I was excited for it's arrival as I was anxious to see if the Nexus Android experience would lure me away from my iPhone 5. I've been using iOS for several years and while the simple interface of icons did bore me a bit, the phone did everything I needed and more.PROS -There is much to like about this phone. When I unboxed it, the large display instantly grabbed me. I was excited to try a phone that was a bit larger. I unboxed and powered it up. I didn't have a micro-SIM card so I couldn't start using it right away (the iPhone 5 has a nano-SIM). I set everything else up and connected to WiFi. I started configuring all my accounts, apps, etc. I came across some issues but overall it was nice.Screen (4.7\") - The screen on this phone is very nice. I don't feel the quality is the same as an iPhone 5, but it's definitely one of the best on the market. It's larger, but not huge like the Galaxy Note  and Note 2. It's also one piece of glass on the front of this phone so there are no grooves are indention's of any type.Customization - One of the biggest things Android fans talk about is the customization that is possible in the Android operating system. The possibilities are endless, of course, having the time to play with these options is another story. You can almost do anything you'd like if you take the time to find the settings and/or app that will allow you to do it. You can also load custom ROMs and root your phone to allow more options. I did not go that far with this phone as I really didn't have the time or the need, but the possibility is there.Android OS directly from Google - The main reason I chose the Nexus 4 was because I liked the fact that the operating system was provided by Google and wasn't junked up with any added interface like HTC, Motorola and Samsung like to do. It's a pure Google experience with OS updates directly from Google and quicker than any other phone. Android 4.2 really is the best Android OS to date. The options are endless, the system seems more refined than past versions and overall it's a needed and very nice improvement.CONS -As a user of iOS, many Android fans would call me a simple minded person. I take that as a compliment. I love technology and I love playing with new gadgets, but for some reason, when it comes to my phone I just want it to work and do what I need it to do. There were several situations that I came across that prevented me from doing what I wanted. Here they are:Battery Life - Far and away the most frustrating part of using the Nexus 4 was the battery life. With my iPhone 5, I was accustomed to getting almost two full days of battery life out of my phone. There were many occasions where when I layed down for bed at 10 PM my phone would be at 53%. This was not the case with the Nexus 4. My battery died every day anywhere from 3-5 PM. I spent several hours tweaking and configuring settings on my phone. I turned the brightness of the screen down to 10%, I turned off unnecessary features like NFC, bluetooth, cellular data when not needed and wifi. I disabled all widgets, I turned off syncing of many apps except email. I essentially turned my phone into a dumbphone by disabling all the things we love to have with our smartphones. Even with all of this, I still was lucky to have 10% battery life by 6 PM. This was unacceptable in my mind and was a big drawback to using this phone.Earpiece and Speaker Volume - Another big issue I came across was when I was speaking to anyone whether it was on speakerphone or via the earpiece I could barely hear them. I spoke with several people ranging from landlines, to iPhones to Android phones to basic flip phones. It was all the same. The volume was up to the max and I could barely here them. The speaker volume was exactly the same, which leads me to my next issue...Speaker Placement - I will never understand why LG and Google decided to put the speaker on the back of this phone. This really diminished the audio quality of watching videos/movies or talking to someone on speaker phone. I found that whenever I used speaker I had to be very careful how I held the phone or where I placed the phone or the sound would either be very low and/or very muffled. This is a serious design flaw in my opinion.Notifications - I know that the Android notification system is loved by many, but personally I did not like it. Perhaps I'm too accustomed to iOS notifications, but I personally don't like to have all my notifications pop up on the top of the phone. It's great for text messages and missed phone calls, but I didn't want all my e-mails to show up, all my google voice calls and texts and others. I realize I could turn these off, but with iOS I could actually have a badge show up on the app showing that I have a notification for that app. Nothing more, nothing less. I simply would open the app when ready and check what it is. I prefer this method because I use my Google Voice account for business and didn't want to be bothered with notifications all the time, but did like to know when something was there for me to check when I had a chance.Apps - The Play store has many apps to choose from and I like the changes that have been made in the transition from Market to Play. Unfortunately, the quality of the apps was very poor in my opinion. I use a variety of different apps, utilities and games. Many of the apps I used (particularly banking apps) were very poor quality. They were clunky and looked unfinished and many were very unstable. They stopped responding, they crashed, etc. When browsing the Play store, having to sort through the junk apps to find higher quality apps is another bother. I realize you have junk apps on iOS too, but I noticed far too many apps that did not apply to what I was searching fro when browsing the Play store. I know that Android is capable of having a smooth interface and app experience, but it's up to the developers to refine their app and that clearly didn't happen on the apps I used.Size - I listed this as a  pro, but I found it to also be a con. Here's why: I'm not a small guy - 6'1\" and 190 lbs. My hands are average size and I found the phone to be difficult to hold at times. I loved the large screen, but the comfort level of holding a 4.7\" screen is not very good. I nearly dropped the phone on several occasions, and did not like the feel of the phone in my front pocket (how I carry all my phones). I prefer on handed operation on many occasions, but found that wasn't possible with this phone for most of the things I did.LTE (or lack thereof) - Obviously, I knew this phone was lacking LTE when I purchased it. I've read many reviews and everyone said that while it doesn't have LTE, it still was fast enough to get the job done. My provider is AT&T; and I saw a huge speed difference in the iPhone 5 and the Nexus 4. The iPhone 5 was constantly grabbing 40 Mbps down while using LTE. I was lucky to get 2-3 Mbps on the Nexus 4. I don't blame the Nexus 4 entirely for this as I understand that it's the AT&T; network more than anything, but the phone is lacking the latest technology (for many reasons, some out of Google's power) and that hurts it's functionality and value in my mind. Streaming video on LTE is like no other. It's faster than my home WiFi and is very smooth. HSPA+ on AT&T; and the Nexus 4 felt very bogged down and slow.CONCLUSION -After spending about a week with the Nexus 4, I decided to go back to to the iPhone 5. I enjoyed using Android and enjoyed a lot that this phone had to offer, but the battery life was one of the biggest problems with using this phone. It's a shame, as this phone has a lot of potential. My experience is going to be different than everyone else, but I hope that this review will help others decide whether or not the Nexus 4 will fit their needs.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible Quality", "Author": "OPEN HOUSE", "ReviewID": "RTPX1DBC41WCC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Screen stopped working in the first few weeks.

Apple (iOS) as everybody knows is a closed, restricted. iOS is certainly a 'weaker' OS, while Android lets you wander freely in the open sky and its more powerful. You will never feel restricted when you want to do anything with it. YOU FEEL YOU TOTALLY CONTROL YOUR DEVICE. That's where I like Android more over iOS. Android does not treat you dumb, it treats you intelligent, responsible and let you control your device and hence its overall usage.I just don't understand how one fruit company can control your device so much whereas on the other hand people even control their own life. More confusing is how people can let a company do that. Just because it produces the best looking product? IF THAT'S THE CASE WHY NOT BUY SOME ART WORK? AT LEAST WE WILL HELP ONE ARTIST. The device is for show-off or your own experience? What is more useful? A trophy wife or a mom like wife which does not look best but keep growing on you each day? Keeping the OS such dumb is for probably making the UI simple. Well use Android (pure stock Android that comes with google devices and you will never go back to iOS and rather you will find iOS lesser user and CUSTOMER friendly.Now little into specs->-----------------------1. Absence of LTE (The so called biggest flaw) -> Well the most sold iPhone 4S was same just 6 months ago and apple fan boy were not complaining at all and they would not had iPhone does not have LTE. Absence of LTE saves battery drain, data usage and HSPA is good enough for what smart phones are intended for and looking at smart phone usage pattern [MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE].2. Camera is not great but good enough.AND REST EVERYTHING IS JUST GREAT-> Super fast, snappy, Screen (as good as retina), call quality, battery life, built quality, looks (great), ease of use. After nexus 3 and nexus 7 this device offers you the best value for your money. You are free to switch carrier or at least deny contract and hence control on your device by the carriers. GOOGLE DEVICES ARE ALWAYS FIRST TO GET UPDATE. My wife is having S2 and she is still waiting for 4.2 even after 6 months of 4.2 coming.----------------------------------------------------------------------Two Real life Examples iPhone lovers who converted into nexus 4 users----------------------------------------------------------------------1. My friend who was using latest iOS on iPhone 4S just said: AFTER USING NEXUS 4 iPhone FELT LIKE TOY. Now there is no going back for him.2. Another prime example (probably one of the biggest iOS (apple) lover Ralf Rottmann. He is co-founder of biggest iOS (Apple) app developing company of GERMANY and has the latest Apple TVs, two iMacs, the latest MacBook Air, a MacBook Pro, more than five AirPort Express stations and Apple's Time Capsule and yes iPhone 5 as well.HE HAS NOW TOTALLY CONVERTED INTO NEXUS 4. Read this great article (gizmodo dot com/5973073/an-iphone-lovers-confession-i-switched-to-the-nexus-4-completely).-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bottom line-> Need phone now or need unlocked phone? Go for nexus 4. Can wait? wait for next nexus phone.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap for a reason DON'T BUY", "Author": "bg", "ReviewID": "R7RVBG047BVG4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I owned this phone for 2 days when, like so many other customers, it just died.

Since it needs a micro SIM, I had to wait until Saturday to get my SIM cut down.  I installed the typical applications (Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Yahoo Mail) and configured my emails accounts (three Google accounts, one Yahoo account, and two IMAP accounts).Everything was going fine until I notice that the phone rebooted itself for no apparent reason.  This happend a couple of times between Saturday and Wednesday.  On Wednesday evening the phone simply power off and I was not able to turn it on again.  I imagined that it may be that the battery was at 0%, so I connected it to the charger, but nothing happened (it is suppose to show a white battery filling up on the screen).  I left it all night.  Thursday morning (around 6:00 a.m) I googled \"nexus 4 wont turn on\" and my surprise was that apparently this happens to a lot of people.  I follow some instructions in a forum and was able to get my phone charged.  After charging it to about 80% I started using it again, until it around 10:00 a.m when it power off and never power on again.When trying to revive my phone I notice that sometimes a flashing red led would appear.  I googled \"nexus 4 flashing red led\" and found lots of forums that described my same problem, without a solution.  Most people in the forum bought the phone directly from Google, and what Google does to solve the issue is to replace the phone.  Other forums mentioned that the red led means that the phone is dead, but others say that it means that the battery is 0%, so I left it charging the entire night.  No luck.On Friday I contacted LG support and what they recommended was to return the phone.  Since its been less than 30 days since I bought it, Amazon has been help full in providing me with everything I need to return my product.Some people mentioned that this never happened to them, others believe it is a software issue, and others believe it is a hardware issue.

Defective product! & Terrible Service!I stil cannot believe why some people choose \"not helpful\" for the review of unreasonable back crack. It's the truth. Only what I can believe is either Nexus/GOOGLE fun or GOOGLE/LG hire somebody to click \"no\" for it.A week ago I see a crack on the back of the screen. It's only 3 weeks after I received the product.I used the phone for 3 weeks with no drop on the floor. I'm a kind of person always taking care of my personal stuff so well. So I believe the phone is under my control.Then I did some research and find a lot of similar problems happened. There has been some conclusion that it is caused by temperature. So technically, it should be a design problem, which I believe that it is defective product issue.Then I contact GOOGLE and learn 2 things:1. Google only has 15 days policy to return the product.2. Google will charge 15% restocking fee if we return the product.What a big company! What a terrible return service policy they have! Especially comparing Amazon!Then I told them the problem about the crack, they said they are not responsible for the \"damage\", I should contact LG for repair.After I contact LG, the customer service is terrible. The first one said they don't have this kind of problem, and he said that it is physical damage and not apply to the warranty, and need me to send it to LG to do examination, and need two weeks to get the phone.1. I need to pay the shipping fee.2. Wait for 2 weeks.3. Probably I need to pay repair fee because they have made decision that it doesn't apply to the warranty.4. I told him about the defective problem caused by temperature, he told me he's never heard about that and all customers called about the cracks are because they drop the phone. The truth is I've never dropped the phone after I got it, and there has been some news can be searched online by GOOGLE! How happened it has been in some news!Conclusion:1. Terrible services by two big companies throw the ball with each other. The customers are the loser finally.2. I still believe the CSR in LG is lying.3. I won't believe Google can do anything anymore. I probably like CSR in LG better because they are straight, not like Google's CSR, kindly saying a lot of words, but no help.4. Terrible Google return policy. 15 days return with 15% restocking fee.

Google Customer Support awful", "Author": "SurlyHiker \"SurlyHiker\"", "ReviewID": "R3M1IA15HO1SMJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After dumping my iPhone to return to the GoogleVerse I purchased a Nexus 4.  I wanted the \"pure Android\" experience, prompt Android updates, etc.  I was very happy with the phone for the first 10 days until it suddenly died.  I left it plugged in for 36 hours straight and the thing is a brick, even though the orange charging light comes on.I called Google support and spent a half hour with a \"support specialist\" trying everything to get the phone to wake up, including several hard reset attempts.  The phone is still dead so of course I want a replacement sent promptly since I have been without a phone for 48 hours already.  But no, the \"support specialist\" then tells me that I have to plug the phone in for another 4 hours (even though it has been plugged in for 36 hours straight already) and then repeat all the reset steps again.  It took me 5 minutes of vehement refusals before she agreed to \"talk to a supervisor\", after which they agreed to immediately start the process for a replacement phone.  Even after all of that they will not overnight a replacement phone, you have to order it online again via a link they provide and it won't arrive for at least 3 days, probably longer since today is Friday.  So by the time I get my new phone, and assuming this one works, I will have been without a phone for almost a week.I can certainly appreciate that sometimes you get a dud with any device, but what separates good companies from bad is how they respond in such situations.  If it was my iPhone that died I would have received an immediate replacement through an Apple or Verizon store.  In the case of Google they instead attempt to delay the replacement process while they quote \"policy\", and even once they agree to replace the obviously defective phone they make me wait days for a new device.I have always been a huge proponent of Google and their universe of products, and I own several other Google products including 2 tablets, a ChromeCast, and a Chromebook.  But this experience has left an extremely sour taste in my mouth to the point where I will need to reconsider how dependent I am upon Google Services.  This review is obviously more about Google Support than the phone itself, but given that the Nexus devices and Google are inextricably linked that is fair.  If Amazon allowed it Google would have received zero stars.***Update 1***So I finally got the tracking information on my replacement phone shipment and, knowing that I am phone-less, Google shipped the phone using the slowest possible means.  I normally receive UPS ground shipments in 3 days and I the original phone was shipped two day air.  This phone is not scheduled to arrive until end of day Wednesday, 5 days after the replacement was authorized and more than a week after my original 10 day old Nexus 4 died.  Google wouldn't even earn zero stars from me now, it would be a negative rating.***Update 1***", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "I will not buy anything from LG", "Author": "linuxer", "ReviewID": "R2340ZVEZO03WI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "OK, the phone is fine.

I told him, I told him also it's a broken screen, they will need just to replace it. the rep said, no, you will have to send it first, then we will tell you how much it will cost.Now, if you look for a screen replacement on ebay, the cheapest one cost 100 dollar. That's a really expensive if you compare it with iphone screens. iPhone screen cost only 30 dollar, this one is 100 dollar, and that's a cheapest one.

At first I thought that maybe the odd ticks and bugs where just the way Android was. When I finally saw Android on the Samsung SIII though I could not believe the difference. It was hard to believe they were using the same OS (Android). Samsung's Android implementation is worlds better than this one. It is hard to believe that the phone Google is selling could have implemented Google's OS so badly.There are so many things that make the experience on the Nexus4 painful. For example. If you click on a link that is a PDF. Every other phone will open a PDF viewer automatically so you are able to view the file. One step and you are done. The Nexus4 downloads the PDF of the phone to a folder and pops up a little window to say \"downloading.\". So you have to close the browser, then go find the downloads folder, then try to figure out which file in the downloads folder it is that it just downloaded, then click on the file then, and THEN select what app should be used to view the file. Five steps. Something so simple that is made so difficult gives you an idea of how needlessly hard this phone can be to use.Pros:* Complete freedom. The phone is totally unlocked so you can take it with you to any phone company and use it with no contracts.Con:* Terrible Android implementation. See the description above for details. This one was the deal breaker for me. This is painful to use compared to Samsung's Android implementation.* No expansion slots for added memory.* Really high bandwidth usage. You will need a MUCH more expensive data plan. Since the phone can not store much with it's limited storage it constantly needs to go to the Google services to download contacts, music, photos, etc. So you need one of the highest end data plans.* Battery life is nowhere near what is claimed. Plan on having it plugged in pretty much everywhere you go.* No LTE support.
