{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone! would recommend to everyone!!", "Author": "Greg Kommel", "ReviewID": "R1Y5H2NEB2AO3G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Impression is an amazing phone. I chose this over the LG xenon because its bigger and better. It's AMOLED screen is super bright. Pictures and video looks amazing.  The touch screen is responsive and has 4 different levels of haptic feedback. For receiving calls and messages, you can choose different vibration patterns and 7 different levels of vibrate.The keyboard is pretty big and if you have a small hand, it might slow down your typing a bit. There's a handy message button on the keyboard that opens a new message. There are 4 different ways to text(full qwerty keyboard, virtual qwerty, virtual T-9, and you can also draw letters to type). The keyboard is slower than me, so I'll stop typing and it will keep going.Calls are loud and clear.  You can also use videoshare during calls with other videoshare enabled phones.  The camera is great.  You can't zoom with the camera, but you can zoom in the video mode.  The camera also has frames which are kind of cool.  You can also take panoramic pictures, you take a picture then you put the aim thing in the box and it auto takes a picture and it does this 6 times and automatically lines them all up.Overall, It's a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone who asks.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good smart phone alternative.", "Author": "James Ganong", "ReviewID": "R2V0KKYJE50A9D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone was just what I wanted with a little more added in. I was basically looking for something that could function like a \"smart\" phone (iphone, palm pre, blackberry, etc) but wouldn't have a proprietary monthly charge for using. I mainly text message, talk on the phone, take pictures, and occasionally surf the web.The slide out keyboard is a real plus. It is a bit large, so you have to get used to that. The AMOLED screen is really bright and has a great picture. The phone quality is pretty good. The camera doesn't have a flash, but at 3 MP it takes decent pictures. On some screens (viewing pictures, browser, typing a message), you can turn the phone sideways and it will rotate the picture (like the iphone), but the rotating is inconsistent (doesn't work in some places where it seems it should).My main gripe about this phone is that AT&T;'s webmail doesn't include gmail (which I already knew, so maybe it's more of an AT&T; gripe). Also, the downloadable gmail app or just browsing to gmail in the browser doesn't work as well as it should, which brings me to my next concern. The web browser is a standard mobile phone browser, very rough. It loads pages pretty fast, but it's not fun to use it for any length of time. Another issue, is the lock key is on the side of the phone in such a way that it's hard to unlock. Trying to hold the lock key usually results in sliding the keyboard out a bit. After you're used to it, it's not too bad, but still annoying.Even with all the problems, this is a great phone, and I would purchase it again.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Unresponsive Touchscreen", "Author": "Jenna B", "ReviewID": "RQ7F4ZMET13E3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I loved this phone when I got it!  It was easy to use and texting was a breeze!HOWEVER...My first one went from perfect to unresponsive screen in a matter of minutes one day, for no reason at all.  I'd only had the phone for about 6 months and took very good care of it.  I was able to get it replaced, but my second one suddenly did the same thing (at the 6-month mark again!) and my warranty is now void.  The customer service rep for AT&T; said that she receives many calls about unresponsive touchscreens on Samsung Impressions.I do not recommend this phone for anyone who wants to use it for more than half a year.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Absolutely the best!!!", "Author": "crazy for reading", "ReviewID": "RPML131IVHZVK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the Nokia E71x and just didn't like the fact that the screen was so small, the ringer wasn't loud enough, and the keys were right out there to gather dust.  So I ordered the Samsung Impression (much to my daughter's dismay) and I LOVE IT!!!  I like the fact that it is a slider and therefore I don't have to worry about the keys getting anything on them while in my purse.  The screen is twice the size of the Nokia and even though you can't enlarge the font, it is large enough to read clearly anyway.  The ringer is nice and loud and I can hear it when it's buried in the bottom of my purse.I like the other features on this phone such as the touch screen.  I love the way I can slide things from one place to another and customize the screen to suit myself.  This phone takes great pictures.  At first I didn't have a case on it but now I do (I was always afraid I would drop and break the phone).  With the case on it, I don't have to worry about putting my finger on the lens of the camera now.  I have a tendency to put my index finger there while talking.  Now the case keeps my finger from touching the lens.  I haven't learned how to take a panoramic photo like some have but maybe I will one day.The thing I didn't like was the fact that you don't get a manual - except for othe CD that comes with it.  Since it isn't always convenient to use a computer to find out something about the phone, a manual would be beneficial.  Samsung needs to remedy that problem.I think the phone is fantastic and would recommend it to everyone!", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great phone until.....", "Author": "CJ D", "ReviewID": "RBDU9BQ3DAPJV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone was great to about a year in, when the earpiece died (So know all my calls are on Speaker), the screen started going black, and freezing, until finally this morning it died, horrible phone, i know of at least 5 of these phones that have done this,my mother has the same exact phone and its doing the same exact thing mine is, and she barely uses it, SO DON'T BUY THIS PHONE, i will never buy another Samsung again after this experience", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good phone, but I wish I hadn't", "Author": "kittykat0204", "ReviewID": "R23TEPUC2MHLAI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got the Samsung Impression about a year and a half ago when it was time for my upgrade. I was choosing between the this phone and the LG Vu Plus, and now that I've had the Impression, I wish I would have chosen the Vu.The Impression is a good, durable phone. I don't know how many times I've dropped it. The battery life is pretty good, and I've had no problems in those departments. The touch screen works fine and is responsive. The camera is really good and takes really clear pictures even when your hand shakes.The only things that annoy me with this phone is that after texting for a while the messages will stop sending, even with perfect range and 5 bars of service. When this happens you have to turn the phone completely off and then turn it back on. Even after doing all of this you have to wait until the messaging feature initializes to get back to texting. The other thing is that sometimes when making calls you can't hear the person you're calling. The call will go through and the person on the other end can hear you but there's absolutely no sound coming from their end. When this happens you also have to turn the phone off and turn it back on. This has gotten me in SO much trouble with my parents, especially when I've gone out with friends and tried to call them only to have them get upset with how I'm talking and asking \"Hello?\" whenever they're trying to tell me something.I've never used the internet browser so I can't comment, but sometimes I'm glad that I had the internet browsers disabled because this phone somehow goes on the internet by itself. I've set it down and went to do something else only to come back and have the internet browser up and running.Overall, it's a pretty good phone in terms of durability and battery life, but I read the reviews on it before I got it and saw the same complaints I have now. Now I wish I would have listened. If it wasn't for the phone's annoying goof ups I would love it.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Lauren", "ReviewID": "R454E9B19CH54", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for almost two years now and it has been the BEST phone that I have ever purchased.  I've never had any problems with it until very recently.  I accidentally left the phone out in the heat whilst at the pool at it got so hot that I couldn't even touch it.  I have a feeling that this is what has killed the phone.  I do see that other people have posted similar problems with their phone, but I've had it for two years without any problems until i left it out in the heat.  Now I can't use the touch-screen unless it has been slid out, the screen flashes a lot when i attempt to use it, and it's having a very hard time making calls.  Also the battery now lasts for less than a day because I'm pretty sure my phone shorted the battery out.  I LOVE this phone and the AT&T; store has no phones as good as this one at the moment, so I'll probably just re-buy one from here.  This is the only problem that I have ever had with it so I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a new phone. I never had the problems that other people have posted on Samsung's site or here, but maybe it depends on the phone.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Impression A877", "Author": "DLH1711", "ReviewID": "R3QTMENO8BQBSX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone.

I am very clumsy and dropped it many many times, once down a flight of concrete stairs and while the phone got dinged up the screen didn't crack.I only have two problems with this phone:1.) Occasionally while sending a text message the screen would stay stuck on \"Sending\". It would keep saying \"Sending\" for a few minutes then it would say \"Message Failed To Send\". It would keep saying that no matter how good your signal was or who you were texting. You would have to re-start the phone in order for your message to be sent. You could avoid this problem by re-starting your phone a couple times throughout the day (like when you're eating lunch and not using it). It restarts quickly but it is still a hassle.2.) The slide-out keyboard is slow. You can't type very fast on it because it becomes unresponsive.Other than that great phone.A great feature that it has is that the alarm will go off even if the phone is off, extremely useful if you are on a 2 week camping trip and lost your charger. The battery lasts a long time too, I would charge it once every four days.I stopped using it when one day the MicroSD Card wouldn't read. I took it out and the phone was fine, but when I put it back in the phone would freeze up. It was strange since I hadn't put anything on the card for over a month and it never did that before. I called Customer Support and they said they had to replace the mother board and it would cost $70. I decided not to fix it and use those $70 to get an Android.Occasionally I still use the Impression though, I have it as my back up phone in my emergency kit because it still works great and gets signal where other At&t; phones don't get signal.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Second one", "Author": "Robert F Gentry", "ReviewID": "RCA43VPDHR8WA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Already the touch screen is going out.

Good to have the options though.The one thing I do not like is the sound - like a lot of phones now-days it has one speaker and sounds AWFUL...I take pain meds on a regular basis daily and use my mobile to alert me with an alarm - I *prefer* for the alarm to be a mp3 of my choice as I do with text msg's coming in, which is another reason I bought this phone, as it said you can use your own mp3's for alarms etc.  They lied! I tried this with several, and it didn't work, so downloaded a program to cut up my mp3 to make it 20 secs like their tones/alarms - this still did not allow it to be set as an alarm or for the calendar alarm, so this is a major flaw - since it's an import my ISP won't help me out with tech help, nor can I find it online.I currently use 2 mobiles now - the Samsung for txting and the Nokia for alarms, but have decided to sell the Samsung as I can txt faster on a non-touch screen phone one-handed, and although it's cool to have a hot looking phone, I'm going to go with practicality and usability, which the Nokia wins hands down!", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a bad buy...", "Author": "P.

I bought it to be able to access the internet and check my online calendar and email.  As a voice and text phone, it functions quite well.  However the internet and \"smartphone\" features are pretty weak.The default browser on the phone is just \"ok\", but doesn't support the necessary security protocols to be able to access my webmail.  It also has a bunch of super annoying \"locked\" bookmarks, which you can't modify or remove.  I bought the darned phone, shouldn't I at least be able to set up bookmarks in my own browser?  Regardless, what I would highly recommend doing is installing Opera Mini (works great) and using that instead of the default browser.  My webmail works like a charm on that.Along the same lines, there are a bunch of paid services (GPS, weather, games) which are *locked* within the menus.  The phone will allow you to remove the free services if you like, but the ones are subscription based cannot be modified.  It's as if they are saying \"pleeeeaassee buy this service\".  One time I accidentally activated AT&T; navigator by forgetting to lock the phone when I put it in my pocket.  Of course there was no way to opt-out through the phone, so I had to call AT&T; to get it taken care of.Physically the phone is built well, with a robust slide out keyboard.  It really snaps in and out of place very firmly and feel substantial.  After one year it's just as structurally sound as it was on day one - and yes I've dropped it a couple times.  Like most phones, the shiny front and plastic backing will become scratched over time.  Reception is generally good and dropped calls are rare.So overall this is a nice phone, but I wouldn't qualify it as a \"smartphone\".

But not perfect", "Author": "ilajna", "ReviewID": "RVCIAQDH0F85V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for about two months now.... I like it but it does have a couple annoying problems.I haven't yet had the freezing problem some others are mentioning. But I HAVE noticed that when you first turn the phone on, you it takes about a minute before it will let you access the messaging feature. Kinda annoying. It takes longer than it should to send a text... a couple of seconds each time. Also, it would be nice if text conversations were shown as threaded, but this is a minor concern to me.Worst part of this phone for me is the battery life. I have to charge it pretty much every night for several hours. It does not charge quickly, and WORST OF ALL, if the battery is low, the phone will shut off even when it is plugged into the wall. It has done this several times while I was in the middle of a conversation, or when I had it charging at night and was counting on it as my morning alarm. VERY ANNOYING.Plus side for the alarm is that the phone has a \"Auto Power-Up\" feature... you can turn the phone off to save batteries and it will turn on in time for the alarm to go off. Pretty cool... never had that on a phone before.I don't use the internet features on this phone, so I can't comment on that.I use this like a regular cell phone, for talk and text, not like a smart phone. Aside from the problems I mentioned, it does the job for me and I like it a lot. Its sleek and pretty, and not too bulky to fit in the pocket of a pair of tight jeans. The touch-screen works well, display is clear, bright and beautiful. I have no problems using the QWERTY keyboard (but I am a girl so my fingers are small) and it is SO much better than texting with a regular phone keypad. Love the fact it will bluetooth or USB connect to your computer, so its easy to upload pics and music, or even use it like a pen drive to transport any type of files. (If you do this, you WILL need to buy a SD card, or you will use all your memory up really fast.) I also like that you can use any recorded or uploaded audio clip as a ring-tone, so there's never a need to buy. Its quite durable.

I can't read text messages, so my phone keeps buzzing every two minutes to let me know I have new messages-- unless I turn the volume all the way down, in which case I miss in-coming calls because the ringer is also turned down.I can't even get my data off the phone because when I connect it to a computer and I'm prompted to choose a type of connection, I can't make a selection because the damn touch screen won't respond.What kind of head-up-his-rectal-orifice imbecile designs a device that is rendered all but fully crippled despite the 47 non-touch-screen buttons found on the rest of the bloody machine??  Not even the \"RETURN/ENTER\" button does anything useful!Other things that are wrong with this worthless piece of rubbish before the touch screen stops working:* Despite the EIGHT GIGABYTE memory card inserted into the phone, it cannot be used to store simple data like text messages, so it's all to easy to use up your text message capacity.* Long text messages may use up multiple text message slots.  No big deal if you're keeping an eye on your total message count, right?  Wrong!  The text message memory management tools still counts multi-slot messages as single messages, so you could have over 200 \"available text message slots\" and still get hit with, \"You have a new text message but not enough memory to receive it; delete some old messages.\"* I set my phone to \"automatically delete oldest messages when full,\" yet I still got slammed with \"You have a new text message but not enough memory to receive it; delete some old messages\" WITHOUT any old messages being automatically deleted.* I finally caved in and selected \"automatically delete messages that are three weeks old.\"  Every night at midnight, the display lights up as brightly as it can, and makes the loud, default, unchangeable \"DING!\" noise for each message deleted.* When typing messages with the keyboard, every keypress registers anywhere from 0 to 3 times.  Best result are had if you mash the buttons angrily with enough force to press your thumbs through steel walls.* The random keystroke multiplier also occurs when trying to dial phone numbers or use automated services which respond to EXACT number-input, which means I've had to hang up and call again a few times to navigate some services' phone systems.* The text typing program tries to help you compose grammatically correct messages by scanning the ENTIRE message and making sure that, if you just entered a SPACE character after one or more other SPACE characters, and the last character preceding the first SPACE character was NOT a PERIOD, it automatically inserts a PERIOD character for you, even if it means placing it immediately after an EXCLAMATION MARK, QUESTION MARK, COLON, or any other grammatical character.* Because the ENTIRE message is scanned for PERIOD insertion with EVERY keypress, when composing moderately lengthy messages, the message scanning slows down the keypress buffer and keystrokes are lost, so you have to slow down to the point where it's advisable to wait the entire 1 to 2 seconds it takes for the last character you entered to appear before trying to type another.* The phone has a feature that lets you view plain text files by arbitrarily choosing a fixed character length at which to wrap the text then generating a graphical representation of the text as it would appear on a sheet of paper.  The characters-per-line length is such that you have to zoom in to be able to decipher any of the text, then pan back and forth to read the text line-by-line.  Whether you are viewing in portrait or landscape mode, the scale is the same and unchanged.  Viewing in landscape is better because you can see more horizontally, but you still have to pan a few times to get all the way across a line.  EACH time you pan or zoom, the graphic representation is fully regenerated, and it is NOT fast.* When scrolling through file lists in landscape mode via the UP/DOWN arrow keys, the file list scrolls the same distance it would if you were using the UP/DOWN arrow keys to scroll in portrait mode, which is IMPOSSIBLE to do because the arrow keys are hidden when you've tucked the keyboard back inside the phone for portrait mode.This phone was obviously designed by complete and utter idiots.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "please call on my cell 408 833 4433", "Author": "Donna Dittrich", "ReviewID": "R1VK5TFIATGDKD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "saved phone numbers are automatically deleted at times----frustrating when this happens.I like the phone overall but my old Samsung phone did not delete phone numbers like this one does", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Cynthia L Hayden", "ReviewID": "R38YRY6JBB0AQI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have always bought Samsung phones and they have always been a good product.

It had a neat little sidebar, and was easy to use. Unfortunately, within about 12 months of this, my phone really started glitching. My dear samsung impression began to have static. The screen started to turn into negative colors, or just any colors. The text would sometimes flip backwards. However, these were just lapses. I thought that they would go away. Within 2 weeks of this, the screen flipped, and it moved up about 1\" from the bottom. So we just had a black space. The funny part was, that if you pressed the black space (where the touch screen buttons should have been), the still \"screen\" part, would respond. But I couldn't see anything, since there was a big black part on the screen. So, I had to trash the phone. I thought I just had a glitchy phone, so I got another one. It's been about 10 months again, and the exact same thing has happened, except its broken within 1 week of the \"weird color phase\", and it broke because the touchscreen has just stopped functioning.never. ever. getting. a samsung phone again. majorly disappointed.
