So I wanted to return the phone don't do returns, only exchanges for a different model so I will keep the phone. SO I have learned from this whole experience, read and follow what others have said about the BLU products nice phones but they aren't pricey but just pay for the real thing no worth the headache. The only reason am giving it 2 stars is because it got here in a day and a half so it was very, very fast.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$89.99", "Features": "Cellular Band - Quad-Band 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 Mhz", "Name": "BLU Tattoo S Q192x Pink QWERTY Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Bar Cell Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Gg%2BAZ-FUL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CBYZKSK"}}
