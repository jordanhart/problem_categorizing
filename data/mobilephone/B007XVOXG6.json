I have had iPhones, where the user interface is just so boring, even with all those apps that cost you money.The Nokia has wonderful Nokia apps already installed, such as Nokia Drive, which gives you directions while you are driving with a talking attendant, it is super accurate and fun to use.  You get Nokia Music, which is a free music service with 1500 playlists put together by expert music people, very good and it's free!  You get ESPN, Nokia City Lens, which is where you hold your camera up while you are walking a city street and it will give you information about the area and what you are pointing at, it is really cool.  And there are other free Nokia apps as well, like Camera Extras, that let you do things like take action shots and panorama photos. There's a Six Flags app, PGA Tour, Contacts Transfer, The Caddie +, Univision, Groupon, Soundtracker that connects you to Internet Radio for free, let's you get concert tickets, look at lyrics, share comments with your friends on their music, et.  There's Counters, that keeps track of calls and data usuage, Creative Studio, which is a photo editing app, and so much more!As a Windows Phone, you will have 7GB of Free Cloud Storage (which is the most for any Cloud Storage offered) for all your files and music and apps on Sky Drive, with the option to upgrade at a cost.The camera takes great pictures with the Carl Zeiss lense and there are ways to adjust you settings. The phone takes great 720p videos, which is a whole lot better than 1080p in a lesser camera.The Windows 7.5 user interface is super easy to use, and it is very pretty to look at.  There are a ton of apps in the MarketPlace, and the most popular ones are there, many of them are free.The beutiful cyan body on this phone is a matte finish, so it doesn't show fingerprints, it is made of polycarbonate, which is the same hard plastic that eye glass frames are made.  If you were to get a deep scratch the color goes all the way through, so it won't show.  Even the USB Charger has a modern style, with it's round geometric shape outlet plug.  All in all this is one hot phone.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia Lumia 900...an owner review for the everyday person.", "Author": "C. White", "ReviewID": "R17SP6KTI3QMG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great! It's the best phone I've ever owned. I have been a dedicated high end Android user, but I found this phone to be a much more satisfying experience than either the iPhone or the Android phones. I want an OS that will meet my current needs and have a great user interface with a good amount of apps available for me to manage my daily mobile cell phone use, and not have to make expensive phone upgrades all the time. The Nokia Lumia 900 is a very well constructed phone.The aesthetics are pleasing, it's modern and function goes well beyond my expectations. It operates very fast and smooth even though it has a single core processor and only 512MB on RAM. If you are not aware of these specs, you might think it has a multi-core processor and more RAM on board. Nokia has come up with a phone that is both pleasing in design and very efficient when it comes to performance. The screen is bright with beautiful color saturated screen, and seems to have less glare outside when it's sunny. I can actually read the screen in such conditions. This is a big plus for me! It has 16GB of ROM, which is plenty by itself, but pared with the 7GB of frees cloud storage, it's more than enough for me. I really don't know what the fuss is about concerning the number of apps available for Windows Phones. Unless you are some kind of developer or techy person, there are plenty of apps available for this phone (both from MS, Nokia and third party) for the everyday cell phone user, even business user. The game apps seems so much more refined (probably because there are a lot of Xbox games available for this phone) and they run beautifully on this phone. I travel a lot and I'm really looking forward to  using this phone on my trips. I have always liked Nokia phones because of the quality build and support. When I started using a smartphone I got away from Nokia phones and started my Android experience. Now that Nokia has chosen to team up with MS to re-enter the smartphone market, I wanted to try their phones again. What a lovely surprise! I'm crazy for the Lumia 900 and look forward to future offerings from Nokia, if and when I get tired of this phone or need to upgrade. I recommend this phone, it's quality at affordable prices. Great design, sturdy, fast and very easy to use, especially if you run Windows 8 on your computer. Try it! You won't be sorry. By it from Amazon, the best place to shop and that's coming from a person that doesn't or ever has worked for them. I forgot to tell you that there is an upgrade of the operating system to 7.8, which is very similar to Windows 8, available for this phone. It's very easy to install, just install Zune on your Windows computer, connect your phone to USB,  and it will find the upgrade and instruct you how to install.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first Windows Phone! Amazing experience!", "Author": "Joel Moreno \"Jo Black\"", "ReviewID": "R1IJAT4W5ROOPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this phone a few weeks ago and it is gorgeous. The screen just blew me away and the OS is very fast and user friendly. This is the first time I try a Windows phone and I have to say that it's been a wonderful experience. From now on I'll just use Windows phone for my daily use. My next gadget will be Nokia Lumia 920. I just can't look foward for this phone to hit the market. Nokia designs the best and most beautiful phones and now they work with the best OS on the market. Well done, Nokia and Microsoft!Now, let's talk about Apps. I've read many comments of people talking about the ''lack of app'' on the Marketplace. I can tell my own experience. I come from Android and also I had a Apple iPhone 4S and the only App missing on the Marketplace (talking about me and the apps I use the most) are Instagram and OVO (and I've heard Instagram is comming soon to Windows Phones before this year ends). I have Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, MSN, KiK, Viber, Badoo, SkyDrive, Tango, Skype,Youtube,Shazam, SoundHound, Netflix, IMDb, Evernote, ESPN, CNN, Univision,SkyMap, TuneIn Radio, WhatsApp, Wikipedia and Weather much more... Also the Nokia App (Nokia Maps, Drive, City Lens, Music, Trailers, Creative Studio, Counters, Soundtracker, Transit, Contacts Transfer, Camera Extras and much more). The Marketplace keeps growing. The integration of Facebook, twitter, MSN, LinkedIn and Foursquare in my Windows Phone is AMAZING! I can put comments and give ''likes'' directly from my phone due to the AMAZING integretion between those Apps and my phone. and I don't have to go to the Facebook or Twitter App to do that.I'm totally in love with my Nokia Lumia 900 and its amazing OS!

Im a programmer, so I really appreciate how easy it is to write software for it. That being said, the phoen itself is what I'm rating so lets get to it.The Good:I love the feature-rich experience and the battery life is quite good. Despite what I have read from other websites it seems fairly light to me (then again, I don't like owning a smartphone that feels like its gonna float away). The speaker is one of the loudest I have ever heard on a smartphone, and it outputs really good quality audio too! The camera takes excelent quality photos and I feel that it is quite feature-rich. The flash is extremely bright, and makes a good flashlight in a pinch. the case is so tough that I dare someone to try and break it. I have yet to scratch the phone case itself and I have had this phone for about 6 months now (I tend to drop my phone, so this is impressive).The Bad:Let me first say that I DO NOT have a problem with the hardware. I have a few compaints about the software though. If you know about WP already then the rest of this section won't help you. That being said, I would dearly like to be able to make playlists on the go without the need to sync with zune software. I will also be excited when more developers get apps into the store (although all the ones I need are already there). My biggest issue right now is the OS upgrade, or rather the lack of one. WP8 came out and lumia 900 users kinda got the shaft.Bottom Line:This phone is an excelent choice! The price is excelent, the calls are clear, the interface is sleek, and the phone is near indestructable. I would like to see some love from microsoft in regaurds to software upgrades, but other than that I would (and do) recomend this phone to anyone who wants a good, dependable phone.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not an unlocked phone - Sold by: BLUTEKUSA", "Author": "Claudia R.

However, I decided that it may be time to upgrade since I would like to be able to use this phone overseas on travel. I did some research - thought about going with the new Blackberry Q10 - but the outright unlocked purchase price is high and I wanted to test out an unlocked GSM phone before I went hog wild on the phone of my dreams.I went with the 900 because it is affordable but not too outdated yet (although the 925 AT&T; and 928 Verizon are already out). I read great reviews on the design and wanted to go with something other than the iPhone.I was not disappointed.Kudos to Feel Good Sales - the product was unlocked and worked right out of the box when I took it down to T-Mobile for a SIM card. It was just as advertised - new (AT&T;), unlocked.Please keep in mind that there are many different vendors that sell under the same item number so you don't really know who the seller is. I chose to go with an Amazon Fulfilled seller, believing that there is a bit more consumer protection if they are responsible for the processing of the transaction. Also believing that if a seller uses Amazon to fulfill, they are probably selling what they're advertising since returns seem to be processed through Amazon also. In any case, be careful which vendor you choose and check their ratings. I read some of the reviews for other vendors (especially direct sales) that would lead me to believe that not all sellers are created equal.So, it's super easy to set up the Lumia 900 and I found lots of forum hints on it. The one thing that I had a problem with to start was sending and receiving MMS (pics through text). But I found a topic online that told me I needed to download the Network Setup app from Nokia and select my provider - it worked perfectly.Marketplace is really easy for downloading apps because I already have an Microsoft e-mail account. I am not a heavy user of apps so I don't really have much to say about them but they're there and I will probably look into them more.I have read lots of reviews saying the battery life is short but then so it is for the iPhone. Do your research but I think the Lumia 900 is a good choices - especially for me, as a starter smartphone that I wouldn't be afraid to take overseas. I think at some point, I might want to get a newer, international model - hopefully after they improve battery life (according to the critics).But in the meantime, I'm thrilled!", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "If you had doubts about this phone please don't its great!", "Author": "H.

Though I knew the phone was unlocked, I had no clue it took a micros sim card, which I was not aware of and meant I had to go to a carrier and switch my sim card. Problem was solved in no time. Anyway back to this review. I was contemplating an Iphone purchase but I could not stand to spend upwards of 450 plus buckaroos on a phone. This cost me under 300 bucks give or take plus  a few quality accessories. SO in the budget department alone, this phone gets a gold star.I have read reviews there is a lack of apps....I dispute that HOWEVER, do not expect an array of exactly what you see on android play store.  There are a lot of apps for everything you need, some just not as popular. There are financial apps(Citibank, capitalone etc)missing but thats about it. With that in mind, the internet explorer is really smooth(way better than my old phone, my touch 4g slide). It has microsoft word and excel also. The interface is smooth, unbelievable this is a cool phone! One feature that is really different, the GPS navigator. Setting things up did not take long at all. You will be seduced  by the sleek look. I am not done playing around with it, but i know now I made a good choice here. I dont know where Nokia has been(I had one in the early 2000s) but I have since had a blackberry and a couple of tmobile high end phones. Nokia has made a giant leap.4/27/13After a few more days of use I feel real proud about not caving to buy the iphone. The battery life, which with mytouch 4g was ALWAYS an issue, is really impressive. You get at least a good 10 hours if you leave it on,probably longer if you leave the battery saver option on. I discovered the sky drive(similar to icloud) on Marketplace which gives you additional 7Gigs or so free, plus available upgrades for a fee and you get to store for music or other files. I really do think the only thing that will stop this phone from blowing out the competition unfortunately, are the lack of the 'mainstream' apps. Also some apps free on Google play store(android) might not be on Marketplace(if available) But believe me unless you are one for the bandwagon, this change is worth a try, especially if the iphone or high end androids are a little above your budget.", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not an unlocked phone", "Author": "R.

If I can't solve the problem, not many can.)I deduct 2 stars from my 3-star review because this is kind of a big deal for most users. Come on MS and Nokia, how do you expect to survive against Apple and Android with a problem like this?UPDATE: Zune constantly causes trouble. Every time I need to connect my phone to my Win 7 pro pc, I need to troubleshoot manually from the device manager to get the PC recognize the phone. If this happened in 2004, I would understand. Back then, our standards of plug-n-play were much lower. Now, they are high and especially because THIS IS A WINDOWS PHONE CONNECTING TO A WINDOWS PC. How would the people who buy iphones feel if they connect it to their macbooks and it fails to even recognize the device? Dumb right? So, I take a star off. Still good phone for the price, but if you can afford a good android, go for it I say.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought this phone new on another website (woot.com, affiliate of amazon) for 199.99, it was a great bargain for the price. I would consider buying at Amazon.com's price too.Pros:1- Very responsive touchscreen. I can't tell the difference between the latest iphone and Lumia 900 in this regard.2- Light.3- Sleek look.4- Unlocked. (T-mobile doesn't list 900 on their compatible phones list but everything works including 4g)5- Great price.Cons:1- Zune. To connect it to a computer you have to install Zune. Windows 7 doesn't even recognize the phone without Zune (which is ironic, because it is after all a windows phone), I don't like producers shoving down clinger-ware down my throat just because they can. The device has 16 GB memory (12 available after OS and updates). So, why the hell not install the communication protocol on it and don't make me use Zune as interface.2- The landscape mode is a bit glitchy. It keeps going back to the portrait mode when you enter a new contact to your phone book. You have to turn and twist it a bit to get it back to landscape.3- Not as many apps. Most app developers consider windows platform a dead-duck. So, if you want to use the newest apps, stick to apple or android.In-betweens:1- Camera. It works well for a phone camera but nothing to write home about.2- Sound quality. Works well. Again nothing special. The speakers can get very loud, do you really want to use your phone speakers to listen to music?Verdict: Solid smart phone for the price.

So the screen is really good and apparently doesn't scratch easily although, I haven't able to test it.-The games are great, but the really good ones you got to pay for .. lol .. buts thats the case for everything.-Having Microsoft Office on your phone is great for students and people who need to write, edit and read docs on the go.The photo-editing capabilities are great!Negatives-even though I knew it was this big (dimension wise) I didn't get a feel for the phone, so when it came, it felt a little too big to be comfortable in your hand. So I'll suggest to anyone, to ensure that you are comfortable with a phone this big.(And Heavy)-Some of the apps for windows phone 7.8, to me, were poorly designed. E.G facebook: you are limited to what you can do from your phone compared to what you can do on the computer, to me, that shouldn't be.- I wish there was a longer battery life. I more or less have to charge it everyday. Not sure what other phones offer on the market.

In the middle of the text battle my phone screen froze.  I had to turn off the phone and reboot. As a devote PC user we are all used to that.

This phone although stating unlock can not be used to almost any but talk text and music storage without AT&T.;  I left AT&T; because they are so expensive and in Chicago calls are dropped constantly I did not want to go back but here I am crawling back to AT&T; buying a more expensive and limited data plan just to make this stupid phone work.

Well this is not the case with this toy..THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED PHONE!! - FORGET PRACTICAL USE WITH THIS GADGETSimple, practical and easy is not part of the philosophy in this phone..Things you might be used to do on a couple of clicks, here they take 5 to 6 actions away (or more) and time consuming and frustrating results in many cases.. Understanding and finding your way around with Nokia Lumia 900 wp7 is a very high time consuming effort .. So if you are a busy person and like technology to improve your timing working routing, this is not a phone I would recommend.. Because many \"Basic\" cell functions are missing in the software wp7, and the only option you'll find is to search endlessly the \"market place\" to find app that may or may not suit your needs, download them, install them and use them for a while to see if they really work for you.. (mean while consuming the phone memory capacity) And in my case, I don't want to pay for apps that I have no proven knowledge how they work... So you'll end up searching the \"free\" category (which have advertising on them)-No smart dialing (while you type a number does not display contacts that match the number)-No possibility to customize font size-No \"select or select all\" option when typing-No \"one space back/forward\" buttons option when typing and/or correcting, editing any text-No undo-No cut-No possibility to see or view the date when typing a note, message or document-No return or back to previous task-No easy friendly connection, transfer of data through USB and PC-No contacts transfer, share, backup, update, save, import, export through USB or Bluetooth to your PC or other services-No Bluetooth connection to other phones or PC for picture, music or file transfer--Forget about Bluetooth services with this device (only a handful services incorporated) e.i. hands free and speakers, it's about it..-No message (SMS) save or export to PC..-SMS threads font very small size-For a pretty big screen, contact's info (phone numbers, address, e-mail, notes, etc) are ridiculously small font size!!! (can't change it)-What happened to font selection \"Small, Medium, Large\"?-No compatibility to PC Suite  (Nokia's software)-No ringtone selection as desire by user from own music files-No volume set up by user for default ringtones-Volume adjust same for every sound (lets say I just want to set up SMS sound louder but only that, it can't it won't let you)-No sound selection as desire for \"new sms\" or \"new email\" or \"reminder\" you are obliged to use its small library of boring sounds-the sounds options for \"new sms\", \"new email\" or \"reminder\" doesn't let you customize its loudness or volume independently.-No option in selecting any song from your library as ringtone, message, sms, alarms sounds-When playing a song from my Lumia's phone library, it doesn't have a possible way for moving ahead or scroll through the song (forward or rewind)-No phone book option on \"people\" (only internet accounts or all mixed)-Contacts have a Fixed platform that does not let you customize the Titles for Phone numbers-On Contacts the list of options for labeling Phone Numbers is short!! or limited.-If a Contact's name is longer than the space on screen, it wont let you see the complete name, it won't show it even if you place it horizontal view..-The Export/Import option (that you have to locate and download) for getting my Phone contacts from my older Nokia or iPhone to my Lumia, works mediocrely and poor, many details were left out...-No \"draft\" folder for SMS-No \"recent\" option for choosing contacts on sending SMS-No multiple selection of contacts on one step procedure for sending sms (as on \"Android\")-No possibility to create custom SMS folders, i.e. saving moms sms-Calendar \"Month\" view too small, unreasonable unreadable, no visible marks, tags, color or water marker for events-No scrolling day by day on calendar \"month view\", neither on \"calendar day view\".-Confusing calendar day view (looks like an endless list)-Only hourly settings on calendar day view (No minutes settings i.e. 2:30, 4:45, 10:15 or whatever) it is set up by default as a unnecessary long list even if empty..-No summary  view of daily set events when day selected on \"calendar month view\" (without having to go or redirected to day view)-let's say you enter a specific reminder on the calendar, and this repeats let's us say 4 days in a row.. Well there is no way to copy the whole thing and paste it, you got to re-write it all on each day independently on the calendar.-No tile color and/or size customize by user (a Tile is like a icon for shortcuts to a desired function or application)-What happened to saving contacts on the phone?? Only on a E-mail account??-if you are entering a phone number that already exists on your contacts (but you don't know) it won't tell you it already exists.-No adding feature of related apps to a single \"tile\" to group them (as on iPhone)-Sometimes people can get dizzy scrolling all the way down (or through) the endless \"tile\" collection  set up you might end up having, trying to make short cuts to phone functions.-They claim Zune (the connection app for PC and Lumia phones win7) is the ultimate software, but then again a set back in evolution.. Is quite a drag having to connect and disconnect your device in order to see or check if the file has been transferred.. (I get \"envy\" my wife transferring, music, pictures, etc from her computer to her cell phone ;-) and vise versa)-Many times when \"editing\" the info of a song (artist, album, etc) this info would appear on your PC but not updated on the phone..-Many albums from my collection do not appear on my Lumia \"album list\"-Many artists from my collection do not appear on my Lumia \"artist list\"-If you have a long list of music files as I do, with this software \"Zune\" I have to scroll all the way to find an specific music file (no \"find\" or \"search\")-arranges pictures by date.. which is fine, but what about trying to arrange by folder.. quite tricky-No lock/unlock gravity (when leaning to one side on the coach the view changes to horizontal, and that is not necessary what I want)-When I need to write a contact's number in different formats for dialing purpose (i.e. +country code, city, number  vs city code, number, the software will hide one or the other-Only one option for labeling a cell number, many times a contact will have more than 2 cell numbers, but here we have only one option to label a cell number, \"CELL PHONE\" (but only once) How do you label the second cell number? Home? Work? Ridiculous!!-Same thing for work numbers, there's only two \"work\" labels available (what if there are more than 2 work numbers as usually happens?)-No \"main\" and no \"general\" labeling for a contact's number-Only three (3) email addresses can be saved for a contact, and have a fixed label-No phone search, if want to search any thing from one place like most devices (phone search), this does not have it...-When you choose to forward an email, there isn't possible way to edit the content being forwarded.-And so on...*I have found that many users report that Nokia Lumia 900 w7 phone or device SHUTDOWN UNEXPECTEDLY VERY FREQUENTLY having to check constantly if the phone is on.. And find out that has been OFF for who knows for how long.. Can you imaging this? Expecting an important call or text message and find out that the phone has been OFF for who knows how long...  Well, mine is not the exception !!! it shuts down very frequently and unexpectedly, very annoying !!IN THE OTHER HAND If your life is lacking emotions and adventure.. You'll find this phone very amusing and entertaining... And time consuming..-Nice connectivity to the internet, this is more of a internet, social networking device and software... But not a phone!!-Nice prediction help while typing, but needs an UNDO and back/forth cursor option, and improve finger selection-Many things can be \"Pin to start\" (but size and color can't be customized) but then again, you'll end with a long selection of tiles and therefore scrolling endlessly through them to find the one you need to click-\"forward\" is hidden under reply button for sync email accounts..and you better have a 20 20 sightNOTE: I bought this phone because I used to be a Nokia fan.. I have tried to love this device but has disappointed me in a way I didn't expect.. for a \"smart phone\" no so smart..NOTE: Never the less, I see potential in this device, with an update (or Updates, that I doubt would happen) this would be one of the best and complete smartphones!

But, two things have me very frustrated.  The first is that in the picture it did not indicate a carrier- but when I got the phone it is for AT&T; and it has a ton of their stuff on there (I am a T-Mobile customer).  I cannot send pictures via text and  think this is an incompatibility issue with T-Mobile and the phone being programmed for AT&T.;  As you can probably tell, I'm not a techie.  I get nervous when I want to use the navigation app, for example, and it comes up talking about AT&T;'s data plan.  If I use it, am I going to get charged for something even though I have a data plan with T-Mobile since it's an AT&T; app?  I also have trouble getting my emails, at times, but not always.  Don't know what that's about.  It will frequently say it is having difficulty getting a Wi-Fi connection- never had this problem with my last cheap (but T-Mobile) phone.I have googled the texting pictures issue and clearly I am not the only one having this issue.  However, the \"fixes\" some techies identified have not worked for me- or some others who were having the same problem.  My son also got an unlocked Lumia (710 vs. my 900) and he can't text pics either.  He spent hours on the phone with Nokia but they couldn't figure it out.  The T-Mobile people gave him a new sim card but said if that didn't work, it's a phone (Nokia) issue not a service issue.  His new phone also doesn't get incoming calls (they go straight to v/m) although he gets regular texts and can make calls.  Nokia couldn't figure that one out either.  My other son, however, got an unlocked Nokia (also a 710) but it has the T-Mobile logo on it- he doesn't have any of these problems.So, now, I don't know if I should return it or keep it.  I know I will end up costing me to return it.  And it's a beautiful phone in every other way.  I really love a lot of it's features.  But, I would never buy another unlocked phone unless it has the T-Mobile logo on it (and they seem to be hard to come by.  Probably will get harder now that they don't have contract any more).

Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. Lumia 900 has been succeeded by Nokia Lumia 920.  For someone interested in a first smartphone which doesn't break the purse, Lumia 900 is an excellent choice. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.Lumia 900 has 4.3\" (109 mm) 800x480 resolution 217 ppi 16m compared to the Lumia 920 which has a 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 16 GB storage and 512 MB RAM compared to Lumia 920 which has 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  Lumia 900 has 8 MP camera and 720 p video compared to Lumia 920 which has a 8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.4 GHz Qualcomm Scorpion processor compared to Lumia 920 which has a 1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass  compared to Lumia 920 which has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.As you can see Lumia 920 has, what I would say incremental upgrades over 900 but nothing earth shattering. Lumia 900  as well as 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 1830 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 900 as well as 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic.  Lumia 900 has Bluetooth 2.1, whereas  Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Lumia 900 has the diagnostic tool. It can be obtained by pressing ##634# on the dial keypad, which should initiate the download after the last # is pressed. The diagnostic tool should appear on the app list under Diagnostics.On this diagnostic tool one can run tests on the following: Accelerometer, ALS, audio loopback, camera, battery status, DTMF, gyroscope, hardware buttons, headset detection, LCD white, lights, life timer, magnetometer, power source, proximity, speaker, touch and vibration. It's also possible to perform all the tests in one run. This is really cool to have this power at the user's hand!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 900 is certainly the best and cheapest Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market, it was really the best in 2012, but if you don't mind the budget get the 920 or 820 (for microSD card slot).", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works fine", "Author": "l", "ReviewID": "R2I685BRZ2G55M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": null, "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's not unlocked!!!", "Author": "Claudia Zambrano", "ReviewID": "R3R2HTC172BAR7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's not unlocked!I am very dissatisfied with this product the main reason to buy it is that was unlocked.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia Lumia 900", "Author": "pedro goncalves", "ReviewID": "R2KVMAL3PW6WYL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is not unlocked as was advertised on the web.

After a few months the ear speaker became distorted in my 920 and had to return it.  I loved the phone so I wanted to have it repaired.  However, since it was a german phone and not US, Nokia warranty was not valid so amazon just took it back.  That was great except they charged me a $70 restocking fee for something I did not even want to return. (and I sure hope they did not restock it and sell to someone else)  A few months later the 900 started doing all kinds of crazy things, could not send texts or receive or would get a text days later, etc.  This one was a US phone which I much prefer of course.  Amazon would not take it back because Nokia warranty covered it.  I sent it to them for repair and they could not fix it.  They called me to tell me so and that they would send a new 900 to me.  Seemed fair to me until I received phone and this is a huge problem for those buying unlocked phones.  It was an Att phone, I have t mobil.  Nokia does not unlock it, Att has to and it was up to me.  ATT only unlocks it for current customers or previous customer who had that phone with them.  Nokia tells me to call ATT, they tell me to call Amazon and Amazon can't or won't get it unlocked for me so they allowed me to return it.  What they could not tell me was if I would be charged a restocking fee for it as I told them I am not going to do that again.  So I wait for my credit and I am sure I will get it minus a restock fee and will have to get on the phone yet again.  So I am 0 for 2 on the Nokia Lumia's so I will never buy one of those again and I used to prefer to buy unlocked phones but after this experience I will never do that again unless amazon can fix this.

Other than that, after going through two updates via pc (no over the air update available), it's smooth, fast, and awesome.  However, I don't know why Zune music is displayed instead of Xbox music even after updating the phone.  Because of this , I can't use xbox music pass.  Other than that, 16gb is plenty, (I had problems with LG L9 because it came with only 4GB, hard to install apps).  No microSD though.  I refuse to pay $700 for a phone. This is perfect.  THere are many windows apps.  I only use navigation, yelp, kindle, flixter, and audible so it's great.  Oh and the GMail is not accessible, there is no app for it, you have to go to the browser.  Bluetooth works great with my car.  I canceled Rhapsody because Rhapsody on windows phone, at least this one, is slow and lagging.  So I uploaded music tracks and the navigation for music is better than android apps I used before.  Battery life is descent too.  Phone is a lot heavier than say, LG Optimus L9 but have a stronger built feel than Lumia 521.  I returned 521 due to volume button defect and freezing. It's funny because 521 had microSD and xbox music.  Too bad button stopped working, 521 is cheaper too.  But anyway I like this phone.PS: It came in AT&T; packaging even though it advertised as Unlocked GSM.  Phone also has AT&T; logo on it.  I am under TMobile.  Anyway it works and I like windows better than android in terms of getting rid of default network provider's apps easily since I am on T Mobile.  With an android phone, this would be impossible, at least the android phones I've used.

I initially purchased it through Best Buy for a two year AT&T; contract.  I had multiple Nokia phones in the past (the awesome indestructible Meme ones) and was really excited about this phone because it was my first smart phone and I did not want an iPhone.  Long story short, this phone looks nice, but it has given me nothing but problems.  About two weeks ago I woke up one morning to it being worse than ever.  I have not dropped it or done anything to break it.  There is no visible external damage but the issues that it has are significant (detailed below).  I went into Best Buy and they told me to contact Nokia.  I contacted Nokia and kept asking for help to get it fixed (even for a fee) and they said that there was nothing they could do - that I would need to take it to a third party repair vendor.  Right now I'm looking at other phones and having to pay outside of contract.The Pros:- Looks sleek.  I do like the Windows UI with the tiles.  People do like it and comment on it.  Because I've had good luck with Nokia in the past and I did like this phone initially before the issues started, I will give it two stars.- Size.  I've seen many different phones and after using this phone and getting used to it, the iPhones seems to small and the Galaxys seem too big.  This one feels just right.The Cons:- Camera: I've compared the camera to my friend's iPhones and Galaxy pictures and I have to say I prefer their pictures more.  The Lumina 900's pictures offer less brightness and contrast and end up being darker and blurrier in my experience.- Battery life currently ~ 2 hrs (I've had it about a year and expected the battery to still be going strong).- Messaging and internet does not work (this is broken for me, so my experience may be atypical)- Windows OS.  It has some good points and some bad.  I do not like how they require MS Zune for updates.  Added account flexibility would also help instead of forcing Windows Live.  It comes across as Windows forcing people to use their peripheral products when I don't need it.  I don't know too many people who have a Windows Live accounts as their primary email.  I know this is the OS and not the hardware, but it does make a difference.- Initially group texts would just be seen as a single text from one person, and if you replied it would only go to him or her and not the group.  That was frustrating for planning.- The Customer Support.  I emailed them with my problems and they sent canned replies each time until by the third time they just said they could not help.  I know this lack of support is common through the industry, but I still don't like it.- I've had common issues of it just shutting down and glitching and sometimes missing calls since about a few months after getting it.  It got a lot worse about two weeks ago and I'm not sure what happened.Overall I may have just received a lemon phone, so take my review for what it is.

I thought it must be me simply being dense. And nobody at the store knew that it couldn't be done. But that's the case!My bad. I bought a Windows phone made by Nokia: the Lumia 900. Really ELEGANT. Very affordable. Sweet, except I can't read my email thru Apple on this device. It's like asking somebody for directions and being told \"you can't get there from here.\" Seriously, in this modern era, for three computer giants (Microsoft, Nokia, Apple) and a major communications company (ATT) to sell phone/service which can't (won't!) receive email from a competitor is dumbfounding. There oughta be a law!After being told the situation by the very patient, intelligent, lovely people who persistently tried to help me at the store, I came home and called ATT just to verify that this disconnect was fact. The kind lady in phone support put me on hold and soon came back to tell me that, indeed, this was a definitive finding. And it holds for the 920, 925 and 1020 models, as well.Further research would seem to suggest that Apple is the fly in the ointment. So I've hit upon a solution. I will become my own email host. As I already own a domain name for my WordPress blog, thru Godaddy, I will begin using it as my primary email account, phasing out Apple. Hey, buying a Windows phone was a step away from being monopolized, and now Apple has pushed me one more down the path.
