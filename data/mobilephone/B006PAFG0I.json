And so far i loooooooove this phone. It makes the Samsung r355c look like crap. The battery life is wonderful it last all day! And it runs off of Verizon network for those who wondering. It takes awesome pics! The call quality is wonderful. My con is the keys, im a female with big fingers and sometimes when im texting fast i end up hitting two letters at once! And also locking the phone is also annoying i catch myself call people several times. Thank God for unlimited everything.. But yeah i rate this phone as a must buy! :) oh yea and also it rings extremely loud.!", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "if you like black berry type phone this can't be beat for @ $50 walmart.com", "Author": "Brian Gittins", "ReviewID": "R35VL2002RGHDV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "got this for wife so we can get away from verizon contract.. her other phone was a razzle which is almost identical to this one, but now she has 1000 mins/text for $30 month instead of 700 mins/ 500 text for $65..  also this phone works on verizon network/platform or whatever they call it so it works just as good as her old one..  some buttons are different texting took a few mins to figure out but other than that she kept her old # and everything that took a day but big whoop to save $420 a yr.. it's $50 on walmart site or $58 in store and u can get 18 mo warranty for $9 so for once something is cheaper elsewhere than here..", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "basic phone", "Author": "MeaganE", "ReviewID": "R7K2U9SPEKBZ7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this phone a couple of days ago.I got it from walmart on the 30$ straight talk plan for 60$. In my opinion it should be about 30$ for the quality that it is.  For people wanting a basic phone it would be fine, but if you want to do anything on the web browser that this phone has, you will be very disappointed in it. I could do anything but check my email and look at the handful of preloaded websites(walmart.com was one of them).Trying to do anything on facebook was very cumbersome and it lagged terribly. I tried to do a basic google search to test its capabilities and it wouldn't load any pages even on a basic level.It wouldn't even proceed to the search page. Don't expect email notifications if you have a gmail account either. If the web browser had been even marginally better i might have kept the phone but it was lowsy. The screen quality is also poor, and the buttons are tiny. Also, just a small annoyance is that when I was texting, it defaults to the t9word setting whichs forces you to press the spacebar twice everytime you want to start typing a new word. I changed the setting but when i exited the text messages and then entered again later to text someone else, it again defaulted to the t9word setting. In other words, you cannot go to the phone settings to change it permanently. The phone does not come with a micro sd card and that is the only way to utilize the mp3 player.Anyway, if all you want is a basic phone you might like it, but i would suggest finding one that is cheaper. On this phone I definitely felt like I did not get what i paid for. A basic phone shouldn't be sixty dollars. Straight talk's website and various customer reviews made it sound better than it was. I guess i didn't do enough research on it. Hope this reviews helps anyone considering this phone.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "For the money you could do worse.", "Author": "astro_mike", "ReviewID": "R18LUVK3E2WHWV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I lost my phone Easter Sunday at a Walmart bathroom.  Needless to say by the time I realized I left my phone in the bathroom stall it was already gone when I returned.  Luckily I had 100 bucks on me so I purchased this phone as I didn't want straight talks cheapest phone.  I had the similar Samsung r355c in the past and I was not impressed with and I am not in to slider phones at all,  I just don't like them lol.  This phone was only like 54.00 and while it appears VERY similar to the Samsung r355c phone it is about 10 bucks cheaper then that phone and has a more solid, durable feel and quality to it.  It is a nice phone for the price and it makes a great back-up phone!Pros:-Durable, solid phone with a nice finish-Great camera and picture quality for the price range of this phone-Loud ear speaker and ringtone volume-Downloadable facebook appCons:-Tiny full keyboard buttons makes texting a challenge sometimes for adults-Battery life diminishes RAPIDLY if you text a lot or use the web browser-Like most non-android straight talk phones,  the web broswer is VERY limited", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "straighttalk phone", "Author": "pureskinproductsdotcom", "ReviewID": "RGQ3XFH8OYB6K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was very disappointed.

We add a card to the reserve a few days before the30 days is up. Each and every time so far, the phone stops DEAD on the 30th day, and the reservedoes not automatically roll over. Each time, we have to call tech support (a long, long waitto reach someone who does not speak English as their native language) and go through the arduousprocess of resetting the minutes and having him text *2_ _ _ _ (some number, not sure what it is)to reactive the phone.That part is beyond ridiculous.It is annoying, time wasting, and very inconvenient when you use your phone for work.At this point, we are ready to change.  Both of my college aged kids use Straight Talkon the Unlimited Everything plan and don't have this problem. Apparently, the inconvenience islimited to the All You Need, perhaps in some twisted attempt to get to you upgrade to the moreexpensive plan. Either that, or they have really bad programming on the reserve!Either way, it is bad enough that my husband is ready to move on to another phone and another provider.It's a shame, since the calls are clear.But you have to be able to count on your phone, and you just can't with this one (which is for Straight Talk).UPDATE:As of May 2013, after yet another bad experience in April with the All You Need plan not working correctly,We ordered another phone from another company, and have changed over to Net10. It isn't perfect either, but theunused minutes roll over without expiration dates, and no hassles at all about loading extra time.Buh-bye Straight Talk! You really need to work on your service! It chased us away.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "Nisha", "ReviewID": "R14ISIWIDP49M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is a track phone that could NOT  be used through straight talk !!!
