It's not much more than what I described, but it is certainly not less than what I described. I had one of these for about two years and loved it. Then I got one for my mom when her phone broke, and she loved it. Again, it's not a smartphone, which may be a feature for you. This phone worked right away when I put the SIM card in from my mom's old phone. If you don't have a SIM card in your current phone, though, this phone will not work for you. You'll need to change providers.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "unlocked gsm phone", "Author": "vicki belcher", "ReviewID": "R1F7FDCO96V7I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "well i bought 2, 1 was good an attt phone as advertised. the other 1 was a piece of junk. it was not an att phone, the network provider was some funky woo-doo.com. it was not able to connect to internet to down load apps. i sent it back", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy This Phone", "Author": "BillWill", "ReviewID": "R139JVVDRSGXHO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Samsung Evergreen may spend most of its time hung up while \"initializing\" the contacts.
