{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome phone", "Author": "Ema Nnep", "ReviewID": "R3F9XSVAIMSSXT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone with a contract upgrade and it had more bells and whistles than I thought I needed, namely the camera feature.I had wanted a phone that was Bluetooth capable and that had an alarm on it so that when I was on travel I could stay on track so it suited those needs beautifully.  It syncs up with my earpiece like a snap and the sound quality is perfect.  In fact, sometimes I have to lower the volume to a 3 to make it comfortable to listen to any louder.The camera has become one of the best loved surprise features of the phone because I like to take pictures and send them to my friends who are in a 'garden' club with me and we chat about our green thumb successes.  Nothing helps to show how things are growing than a quick snapshot sent out with a few quick button taps.I also send pictures of work I have done for clients in this manner as well so that they can get a visual of the item before it gets delivered to their customer and they know just what they received and when.And the color screen is gorgeous.  The image is crystal clear and the colors are vivid, plus I can make my own wall paper using pictures of anything I've captured in my travels or in my garden!The only negative that I do have to bring up is that the volume level on the incoming calls only goes to 5 and it seems a low 5 so that if the phone is in my purse and I don't have my headset on, I can't hear the phone ringing.  Having higher volume in that aspect would be a great improvement, otherwise it's an outstanding phone.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simple", "Author": "S.

I have had 2 stripe phones to date (lost one and am on my second). I really like this phone.It is basic compared to iphones and the like but it suits me perfectly. It has an adequate camera (on T-Mobile I can send my pictures to the t-mobile website and have them there when I log in to my account). It sounds fine, I can use T-Zones (t-mobile again)to download real sound ringtones etc.I have no issues with the phone and have just unlocked it to use overseas as it is a tri-band.Extras I rarely use are bluetooth, speakerphone and picture messaging.Great basic phone with enough extras to keep me feeling more up to date. Small enough to fit in a pocket or purse but not too small.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0016NVA36"}}
