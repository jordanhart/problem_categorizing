Camera was not working at all with E71: \"camera feature not suported\". Battery drained in less than a day, instead of manufacturers promised 3..4 days standby time, even after buing a fresh battery. Phone heated up more than what I have seen from many other E71's before. I was not planning to use camera that much, but battery drain was the really BIG issue. The phone I got became a $180 paperweight. I was surprised to get something that was this much below, compared to the exceptionally good E71's I have seen before, circa 2009.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia E71", "Author": "saba", "ReviewID": "RH6TG0HVYBTEI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I can't See new Items!, Only used.... why ?looks like a it's good phone, but the price was listed different from now!I did add one of this product to my wishing list..., but no more new items that I can see now!.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.Not all carrier features may be supported.\nQuad-band GSM cell phone compatible with 850/900/1800/1900 frequencies and US 3G compatibility via 850/1900 UMTS/HSDPA plus GPRS/EDGE capabilities\nAccess to corporate communication via Microsoft Exchange; full QWERTY keyboard; 3.2-megapixel camera/camcorder; stereo Bluetooth;\nUp to 10.5 hours of GSM talk time, up to 400+ hours (17 days) of standby time\nIn the Box: battery, charger, connectivity cable, headset, Eseries lanyard, Eseries pouch, user guide, quick start guide and other documentation\nGPS with Nokia Maps; Wi-Fi connectivity (802.11b/g); MicroSD expansion", "Name": "Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Digital Camera and 2nd camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS, 802.11g WiFi, Bluetooth, and FM radio", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61BFsrSN1yL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0020KPPQC"}}
