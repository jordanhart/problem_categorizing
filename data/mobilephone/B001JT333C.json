It is a very easy to use phone. Single piece phone does not slide or flip. This is a nice phone to have for people who don't want a lot of fancy features. Very compact, and with TracFone, you can add as many minutes as you like to the phone. No contracts, cancellation fees, surprises, etc. You're in control. This phone would be highly recommended to anybody who is in need of a simple cell phone with excellent service, but without a lot of fancy features.", "Date": "November 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Mamasdeals", "ReviewID": "RQL57HMN7HZAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a nice little phone. It holds a charge, the sound/voice quality is good and it is the perfect size for your pocket. It is a CDMA phone which works for me in a rural community where a GSM phone won't work. This phone is great for someone who just wants plain function phone. You can text on it, but it doesn't have a qwerty keyboard. The seller shipped fast and was nice to answer my questions.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "great !!", "Author": "Tornado", "ReviewID": "RQU4SL78IQ44C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "El producto llego rapido, la calidad del producto llego en perfectas condicionse.
