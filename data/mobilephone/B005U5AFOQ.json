I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear.  I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear.  I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone.  I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear.  I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear.  I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN.  The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear.  So once again I had to send another phone back.  I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN.  I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best of Both Worlds", "Author": "T.

Evardome \"Ben Evardome\"", "ReviewID": "R3DYA60JISGLQG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to the Samsung EPIC 4G for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard, I really liked the smaller compact size of the phone, and I still needed some of the basic functions of a smart phone (i.e. checking e-mail, getting directions, text messaging) Because the phone is not as powerful as the newer cell phones out there, just be aware that the more applications you install the slower the phone runs and will most likely freeze up from time to time. But the camera works great, the video is great as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need. I also notice that battery life lasts a little bit longer and charging the phone is much quicker than my Galaxy S2.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good!", "Author": "Paige Fralix", "ReviewID": "R1XA7O3TVAI02C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's battery life is great.
