You can put music and games on it if you like- I had the Oregon Trail. It's very user friendly, you can choose what menu items you want on your tool bar, it has calculator, calendar, alarm clock, GPS, etc. The charger is also the same one I have for my kindle, so I can just swap between the 2 when I need to charge.This is an amazing phone and if you love to text then you will not regret getting using this phone.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "CS", "ReviewID": "R3IHBCZPAOCEOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great phone", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just wanted a working phone.", "Author": "Emily McDevitt", "ReviewID": "R6978S33QYCRG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a bit to say about this item. First of all make sure to read the descriptions in depth because the phone in the picture is not the phone you receive. Secondly don't pay extra for advanced shipping because it takes just as long as if you hadn't to receive. Thirdly I got a USB charger with no wall attachment or wall charger. Fourthly on top of all these things, the phone didn't even work. I Plugged it in when I got it and charged it to full before activating. It died within 5 minutes after being fully charged. Cold battery? No. I waited 24 hours having i in room temp (72F) and still after a full charge, dead withing five minutes. Contacting the seller was easy enough and I got a quick reply. Yes they were willing to pay for a new battery which was nice, but after all is said and done I found a different phone instead. The only other thing was the seller had constant mention of having kids and struggling, I didn't really see how this was relevant to a business transaction and seemed rather inappropriate and out of context. If you want good ratings, maybe you should send phones that work instead of trying to guilt trip people.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "its okay kinda easy so far.", "ReviewID": "R23W6P44H5IIOA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "could not hear phone calls, wouldn't connect to web..do not buy!
