{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A basic texting phone with *very* limited Internet capability.", "Author": "Tech Guy", "ReviewID": "R1OE1FXUOMY30L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a VM customer for years. I rarely use my personal phone and have built up a substantial credit balance just by paying the minimum top-up every 90 days.I upgraded to the LG200 because of the keypad and email capability. The phone looks good and has a nice feel. It's about the same size as an iPhone 4, just a bit thicker. I'm using an iPhone pouch type case and it fits fine.The VM LG200 makes calls and sends texts as you might expect. This review is mainly about the email capability.The phone has a (downloadable) Java based email client. It has presets for Yahoo,  AOL, Windows Live, and Gmail. It can also handle POP and IMAP accounts.I have two Gmail accounts and set up one with the Gmail preset, this was easy. I set up the 2nd Gmail account using IMAP settings. Both work fine. Basically you are limited to 50 of your most recent inbox messages. You get charged the SMS rate when reading or sending a message. There is no charge for synching--so just viewing your inbox (sender and part of the subject) does not incur a charge. The email client is very basic, for example, there is no obvious way to delete a draft message.Bottom line:It's fine for sending and receiving short email messages and texts. Expect nothing more.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect Phone For Talking And Texting.", "Author": "Swen", "ReviewID": "R13MNR4N6942XZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to drop the BIG carriers after using them for over 8 years. I was paying on average over those years around 80 a month, since 08 or so with the newer data plans that monthly payment became 100+.So the only reason I even came across the LG 200 was because I was at first looking for pre-paid cell services. I eventually came across Virgin and their [[1500 minutes/1500 texts]] plan for $30. IT CAN'T BE BEAT. So I then looked at the phones they had available. The LG 200 was one of the few they had that I found. There was a more expensive phone with the slide keyboards which I hate, then a cheaper similar one to the 200 that was shorter but it had horrible ratings for keyboard use, and being I text a lot, about 75% text/25% talk, this was important.I just received my LG 200 I bought through Verizon, so even though I am not a verified buyer with this item you can check out the case I bought for this phone which is verified and my review of it which is one of the most recent at, \"Krusell Gaia Slim Leather Pouch for iPhone 4.\" Or just click on my name and see the latest reviews I've left. This case works perfect for the LG 200, so being there are none made for this phone currently that are specific to it, you might want to grab yourself one.The LG 200-THE PROS:1.Comfortable and easy to use keyboard.2.Awesome sound quality and strength, both earpiece and speakerphone.3.Great battery life, quick charge.4.Light yet doesn't feel cheap. Love the look.THE CONS:1.Camera quality sucks.2.Web browsing is ???3.Display lighting dimmer than most ???4&5.No MP3 player/No Video player(Good! Finally a phone that is made for talking and texting)For the cons it doesn't matter. I DON'T use this phone for taking pictures or surfing the web, I use it ONLY for talking and texting. And the display dimness I don't see, these are the five main complaints with this phone from other reviews on the web so I thought I would list them.This IS NOT a smartphone. It is not for taking pictures, listening to music or watching videos. It's a good quality, good looking cell for TALKING and TEXTING. Simple. I love it. I've been so sick of extra features I don't want on cellphones. I have a Kodak pocket cam and a Canon camcorder for taking videos and pictures, if you need music on the run then buy yourself an iPod or something. Who needs internet on their phone? As a decktop pc guy I never understood this.I needed a phone to talk and text, the LG 200 exceeds those needs. Will be recommending this phone and Virgin plan to everyone I know who is in a good coverage area.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "If you want paylo", "Author": "** Maine Payne ** \"ARTISTICTY\"", "ReviewID": "R1TZUHSWSAP9II", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone because I wanted a fairly advanced phone that was compatible with the pay-lo plan.I sometimes had a problem with delayed text messages, I would occasionally receive a text about 1 hour after the person had sent it. Also, about 1 in 5 times while trying to get on the internet, I would receive a connection error message which really annoyed me.The number one reason I sent this phone back, was because after about 4 weeks, the phone stopped charging. I would plug it into the charger and nothing would happen. I babyed my phone and charger so it was in perfect condition and there was no reason for this to be happening.Other than that, this is a pretty good phone if you like to text alot.pros:Downlodable javatexting is very easyclear phone conversationsgreat battery lifeemail is easyhas other features such as notepad, and an event calenderdurable bodycons:no mp3 player/ no way to play musicno way to connect phone to your computerlimited internet capability (some sites don't work at all)camera quality is really bad (only 640x480)cant watch ANY kind of video on itno obvious way to view attachments in text messages (such as pictures)Remember, this is not a smartphone, it's very basic. Great for texting, talking and email. You get internet too, but don't expect the best out of it.If you're on a small budget and are aiming for the virgin mobile $30 pay-lo plan, then this phone would be your best bet.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "I like it", "Author": "Babs \"Avid Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R3HLGYBD92WTI1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A more advanced phone than I had; took me awhile to get used to it but happy I chose this phone.

Seriously, this has the longest lasting battery of any phone I've ever owned or even heard of: after a year, a full charge will last about two weeks! Granted, I pretty much only text and talk very sparingly, never go online, but that is still very impressive standby time. I started keeping track of how long the batter lasts -- so far, I was able to go two weeks and three days (17 days) between charging.-- I bought this phone because I'm primarily a texter: 95% texting, 5% talking. The qwerty keyboard is comfortable and great for texting. The best feature, hands down.-- it's pretty hardy. I don't have a case for it, and I've dropped a few times. Once, from waist height onto a hard ceramic floor, the cover popped off and I was sure the phone was done for: nope, it was fine.-- good call clarity. Again, I don't talk much, but the phone works great at all phone functions: calling, texting, not dying after slipping out of your hands.CONS-- camera is pretty bad. The pics are only decent in full sunlight or a bright room. Also, only way to get them off your phone is to picture text them to someone.-- NOT A SMARTPHONE. This phone doesn't even pretend to it, so don't get it if you want anything above calling and texting.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "A very simple and easy  phone", "Author": "twoz", "ReviewID": "R11O290UDIY8S7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The price is right, nothing complicated here.
