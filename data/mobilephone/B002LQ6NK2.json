We just moved the SIM from the old phone over, charged it up, reconfigured the menus to or liking and back in business.  It's getting harder to find these things brand new any more.  jpj1electronics not only had them, but at a good price.", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "WHAT'S OLD IS NEW AGAIN.", "Author": "Grandpa", "ReviewID": "R23NUUPRRWMD2N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My V180 arrived in pristine condition, exactly as described, excellent sound and good battery. THIS MOTOROLA PHONE IS A WORK HORSE.  I had a V180 from 2004 until 2013, when it just stopped charging. It has been dropped in water several times and still worked.  It was even RUN OVER BY A CAR ON A CHICAGO EXPRESSWAY in 2007, when I left my purse on the top of the car and drove off. I retrieved the phone, replaced the screen, and it worked until 2013.  I didn't want to change phones -- so I purchased this NEW V180. Until you try a \"newer\" flip phone, you don't realize that the V180 has many set-up options that newer phones do not have.  Recommended highly for durable service that goes anywhere. Thank you, Amazon.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Motorola V180 cell phone", "Author": "B.
