I'm afraid I will jinx the great experience I have had with it so far. I read so many recent negative reviews, that might disappointment might be coming my way.BUT, I have to say that so far I love the phone. I had a 8520 before this one, which was barely not working anymore after so many years of use, and dropping on the floor. So, this upgrade was just perfect for me. I travel a lot to developing countries, so I wanted a cheap phone that I wouldn't care much if got stolen. Since BBs are no longer among the favorite phones, like Android and iPhone, I think it is perfect for muggers not to want to waste their time trying to steal it from you!!Regarding BB x other phones. If you haven't had a BB before, I recommend it. The keyboard is great (I prefer than using touch-screen), and this phone's browser is not so bad as previous versions. The sound and camera quality are good enough to meet my needs. BUT, it is not iPhone! I don't like Androids, so I still prefer a BB. But if you are deciding between BB and iPhone (considering that you are willing to spend more money), than I'd not go for this one. But, I think in terms of cost-benefit (if you want to spend less), BB is a win.Regarding the vendor: well... the phone is sort of legit. I wouldn't trust it completely though. On the box, it said the phone was made in Mexico, while several pieces were made in China. The box did not look new, but the phone did. Also, it came with a case, which I was happily surprised with.

The one I got is 3G capable on T-mobile (1700/2100, although I don't really use the 3G), the keyboard and track-pad are great (no touchscreen).  The phone is smaller than other blackberries, and can easily fit in a pants pocket.  Battery life is good, easy to turn antennae on and off.  I can go about 2 days on one charge, but easily a whole day on one charge with heavy use.  I mainly just use it for talk/text and email (for work mainly, so pretty constant), so I'm no app nut, but it's a nice size for me, and they are supposed to be pretty durable.  I really like the Blackberry OS and the contact manager, you can use google voice and make your cell a 2 line phone (1 line for work).However, beware of sellers on amazon (amazon does a phenomenal job of protecting you though).  The 1st new phone I got was great except the earpiece crackled a little, so I sent it back (it did seem new).  On the 2nd try, they tried to send me a T-mobile branded phone (transformersandgsmphones is the seller I used), and it was obviously used, and T-mobile showed it as blocked which means it was stolen or something along those lines.  So instead of giving them a 3rd chance, I got 100% of my money back since Amazon is awesome about that, and bought one off of Ebay.  Went great, and I  love it.1/10/2013 Follow UpHave had this phone for a few months now, and absolutely love it.  Phone is sturdy, reliable, and easy to use.  And it is nice and compact.  With an Otter Box commuter series case it is pretty indestructible.  With extremely heavy usage (5 hour of talk time or more) I still have 30%-40% battery life at the end of the day, and can usually make it 2 days on one charge.
