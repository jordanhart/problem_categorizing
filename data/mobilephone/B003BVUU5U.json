The battery has excellent endurance but I do not make or receive many calls.  The keyboard functions perfectly but it is a real nuisance for long messages (even with abbreviations).  If you want to send many text messages I don't think this is the phone for you.  If you want internet functions I doubt this is the phone for you.  But, if you want a reliable phone for voice calls and a limited number of text messages, then you should consider this phone.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor design", "Author": "eweshere", "ReviewID": "R1M3OE4CZGADXU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We've had a bunch of basic cell phones over the years and many have been LG flip phones. We have always found them to be a good value. However, we do not like the Accolade phones because of a couple of stupid features which have to do with style and performance.First, with this model, they changed the clam shell shape so that when it is closed, the bottom end (opposite the hinge) has no edges or features to grab to get it open. You have to carefully hold it on both sides, top and bottom to fumble it open. Really inconvenient when you are hurrying.Next, they left the camera button active when the phone is closed, with no way to turn it off. It does require that you hold it down briefly, but that can happen easily in a pocket or purse. Our phones were constantly taking stupid noisy black pictures until I took my pocket knife and pried out the rubber buttons.I would not recommend the phone if either of these features bother you. They seem to perform quite well in all other ways.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Okay phone, but problematic for texters", "Author": "Matthew B. Sheffield \"sbgtf\"", "ReviewID": "R1J3ZBPDFJD6PQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a great basic phone for those of us who don't want anything fancy! Only two real problems: one is pixelation for the pics. if you set a pic as your background then the pixelation is terrible. Problem two, and this is the clincher, is that when you try to text, the letters have extreme difficulty scrolling. What I mean is that on the 6 Key, you have \"mno\" for texting. If you're trying to type \"o\" then half the time (no exaggeration) you will get three \"m\"s instead of an \"o.\" Trying to use the 1 key for punctuation is the worst offended. Most phones have a mild version of this problem, but this on is by far the worst offender. You will be quickly frustrated if you are a texter and you buy this phone.

For example, if you want to get to \"f\" you will type the d's many times in a row.-it takes black pictures when you carry it in your pocket. (had like 20 in one day no joke)-hard to hear on the other end sometimes.-In one day, making a few calls is enough before you need to recharge the phone and text'ing included.-The middle end of the phone where it open or closes, it clips my fingers and it hurts when I close it with one hand.-no simLast, but not least,I don't recommend this phone for constantly daily use like for business (get a new phone) or people who need to text/call a lot on a daily basis.  The battery won't last.  If your a text'er, what are you doing with a basic phone?  You will be irritated by this phone in less than 24 hours.But, I do recommend this for people who don't mind basic functions and uses it once in a while.

I don't use it for internet or anything, just for phone calls and texting. Texting is where the problems arise.Obviously, there's no keyboard and so you must text using the number pad. I'm not even saying this is a bad thing either, I obviously knew that's how I'd have to text when I bought the phone.However, say you wanted to type an o, to use an example. You have to press 6 three times to get there. Because of this, phones give you a \"grace period\" where when you press the 6 a second time it will switch the m to an n instead of adding a second m. Same with pressing a third time for the o. You know you're still in this grace period if the letter you're on is highlighted in black. People who text with a number pad should be familiar with this.The actual problem arises here: if you press the clear key (backspace) when you're in a \"grace period\" for a letter, thereafter, for an amount of time that I've been unable to determine, your \"grace period\" for any further letters you choose to type becomes incredibly short. So unless you have hyper speed fingers, typing an o means instead you'll get 3 ms.Note that this scenario is not uncommon, especially for those who make mistakes texting. This is either some sort of weird texting feature that I can't figure out how to turn off, or just a programming oversight. Either way it's unbearably annoying.The other problem I have is that the joint where it flips has gotten really messed up for me and opens and closes strangely and loudly. I've read that others have had problems with this as well.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Verizon Wireless LG Accolade VX5600 Prepaid Cell Phone", "Author": "ROBERT OBRIEN", "ReviewID": "R2522EWVT87LVE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I initially bought this phone to replace my existing Verizon Wireless LG Accolade VX5600 Cell Phone as it had a broken external screen (it was far less expensive as a complete phone than the screens charged by CPR - Cell Phone Repair.Even though my original ohone was a Prepaid, Verizon initialised it as a Post-paid phone, however, they told me this new one could NOT be initialised as a Post-paid, so I just exchanged the electronics between the two phone and I have a new screen and case for my old phone.The Accolade is such an easy machine to dismantle and re-assemble!", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Army Veteran", "Author": "SAL M.", "ReviewID": "R2KQSG80C7HYBL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this little cell phone.

I've been happy with the phone except for one problem - the camera button.If the camera button on the right side of the phone is pressed for a couple of seconds it causes the phone to take a picture. When owners of this phone put it in their pocket or purse they often hear the phone \"taking pictures\" because something is pressing against the camera button on the side of the phone. You can end up with lots of black pictures that you have to delete. And you have to listen to the camera make its \"I just took a picture sound\" again and again.I fixed the problem by creating a dome of epoxy glue over the camera button. As a result, the camera button cannot be pressed - either accidentally or on purpose. I also programmed the \"Up directional key\" as a shortcut for \"Take picture\".A description of how I did this with pictures can be found at hammerbob dot wordpress dot com, look for the \"Camera button fix for the LG Accolade VX5600 cellphone\" article.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "I didn't realize it was a prepaid phone.

It's just the size I wanted, just a simple phone.  Verizon would not let me use it because it needed to be specific for Verizon.

But Amazon was great and I was able to return it for a complete refund with no problems at all.  After I returned this I went back to Amazon to find a Verizon compatible phone and bought it.  Now, for the kicker, Verizon still wouldn't let me use that phone, I had to return the second one as well.  Amazon has much better customer service than Verizon does.\"This was the Verizon phone that I mention in the other review.

So, will the phone work six months?LG makes nice phones and I had no idea the pre-paid lg Accolade is this useless.  In spy novels, sometimes, a villain will  phone with a pre-paid phone, so as not to be traced...after the phone call, the villain tosses the pre-paid into a dumpster.  Ok, I knew that and did not connect the dots, so shame on me for expecting quality.Perhaps a used LG on Amazon would make a nice phone for your use, and verizon won't make you wait six months.
