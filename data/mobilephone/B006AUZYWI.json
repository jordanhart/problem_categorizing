{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bad phone? I don't think so.", "Author": "Charles J.", "ReviewID": "R2U9EYY2UD4OW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm one of those kinds of people who just use other phones that friends or family have just lying around because they themselves are always getting newer phones. I was tired of using hand-me-downs, so I decided to look for one for myself. That's when I discovered the Motorola Charm. I was a little skeptical about getting an unlocked phone, especially considering that the Charm is unique to T-Mobile (I have AT&T;). I knew that getting a smartphone would require me to get a separate data package. To my surprise, AT&T; doesn't read the Charm as a smartphone (at least not yet). That is pretty awesome. Also, the reviews about the screen being too \"pixelated\" and \"washed-out\" are totally bogus. Anyone who believes this to be true are probably those who grew up watching and looking at everything in HD. Get over yourselves, people.All in all, the screen is amazing, the keypad is great, and the phone is just the right size to fit my needs. I'd definitely recommend it to friends and/or family!", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good unlocked Android Keyboard phone", "Author": "Keith Ho \"Amazon Shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R2XLVSYKT89587", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm off contract with T-Mobile.  I previously had a Samsung Vibrant but hated typing on the touchscreen.  I replaced that phone with a Samsung Blackjack 2 but that phone was slow and had almost no modern day functionality.Pros:1) Physical keyboard is only reason I bought an Android phone.  I use to have a Samsung Vibrant and onscreen keyboard drove me crazy.  I can type fast on this keyboard.  A little spongy compared with Blackberry but works good for fast typing.2) Speaker phone is loud and earpiece is good, but not as loud as Blackjack 2 or Samsung Vibrant.3) Music player plays music well.4) Ringer and notifications are loud and clear.  On par with Samsung Vibrant.5) Screen is responsive to swipes and touch.  However the screen is so small that touching the icons can be difficult for people with large fingers.6) Bluetooth for my Jabra EasyGo connects good.  Does not disconnect while driving.  Sound is loud and clear, more of a function of Jabra EasyGo.  Bluetooth stereo works as well.Cons:1) The first 2 hours after inserting my SIM card, the phone kept rebooting.  It was totally annoying.  However, the reboot went away.2) You have to hold the on/off button 5 seconds for phone to turn on.3) There were no extended battery or extended battery door that came with phone.  The seller description stated \"9 hours with extended battery\".4) The screen is very low resolution.  Barely read text when surfing the web.  However, you can read text in direct sunlight if the brightness is turned high.5) GPS is slow to work indoors.  Sometimes doesn't work.6) Battery life, needs extended battery. Battery life is less than 1 day with wifi, 3G turned off with moderate use.  With everything turned on, heavy usage maybe get 6 hours at best.Bottom Line:  If you need a physical keyboard with Android, get this phone.  If you don't, I would not recommend this phone.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Moto Charm..", "Author": "Alejandro Rodriguez R.", "ReviewID": "RNTIC11KHM8OY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am from Costa Rica..

Adams", "ReviewID": "R20T2VNY36WILP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This unit arrived in the factory box with French and English instructions- well ahead of the projected delivery date. It appears to be a refurb- the MotoBlur weather app wanted to give me Ottawa, and refused to update to my location- but it's cosmetically perfect and it works as advertised. I had no issue setting up MotoBlur- and I can verify that as of yesterday, AT+T still doesn't list this as a smartphone- and hence requires no data plan for it. I promptly covered the annoying Moto interface with a free app- Launcher Pro. Note that all the mandatory apps still run and still reduce battery life- but the phone works faster and no longer tells me what the weather looks like in Ottawa. The music player supports several formats, including WMA, which is way better than MP3. The social networking apps are useful if you have friends that insist on using them- as I do- and the qwerty keyboard is very nice indeed for someone like me- with large hands. The camera and video recorder? Well...it's two years old at this point, and the resolution isn't exactly stellar- but for casual use, it's fine. The Motorola apps for interfacing with PC's are useful- and free. I'm running a 32gb microSD card without any issues. The WiFi works and I have internet access almost everywhere- with no monthly data fee, slow speeds, or parsimonious limits. The touch screen uses the familiar flick, pinch, etc; and for less than $120.00? Can't beat it.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good Product, Just Wish it was the Right Colour", "Author": "Sabnuts", "ReviewID": "R2FKEVVJOEJ5EL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The item arrived Thursday March 8th, 7 days early! That was awesome considering my time constraints. BUT, I was supposed to get a BLUE/SAPPHIRE phone and instead I received a BRONZE one. I don't mind this because I like the bronze too, but they should take more care in preparing for shipment...it clearly says \"BRONZE\" on the side of the box. My only other problem with the phone is the back cover. Every time I try to take off the pop-off cover I feel as though I am about to break it. Also the regular battery only lasts a day (with heavy use), but the extended battery is a better fit for people who are always on the go (don't worry though cuz that comes with the phone too).Besides that, I LOVE this phone. It does exactly what I needed it for and more. The keyboard is very conveniently placed, fast, and easy to use; I blog from my phone all the time now. The widescreen makes reading articles feel so natural and the backtrack lubricates your browsing experience. It works well with google maps so I can get around without worry of getting lost in this new place. The FM radio is awesome and the headphones that came with the phone are very comfortable. Videos play without hiccups. Ooh when your phone is charging a green LED light glows from the port connection and then turns off to let you know that the phone is fully charged. I like the size, feel, and look of the phone in general.I'd recommend this phone to others.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Motorola Charm MB502", "Author": "Uly", "ReviewID": "R1CIFKWBNQYIKM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like the features of the mobile phone.

It's the ONLY touch + full qwerty keyboard android phone on the market, to my knowledge. It's wider than a blackberry and is so easy to text and type with, it's amazing. The touch screen is obviously smaller than most other smart phones, but is still fast and easy to use and makes a great transition from keyboard to touch phones.  As most full keyboard phones do not have touch screens attached, it's nice to be able to ease yourself into using touch screens, if like me, you're more comfortable with keyboards. With the extended \"butt\" battery, (all I've ever used since day one) if charged nightly, it lasts all day long even with extended talk, text, and bluetooth enabled all day.  I do however turn off GPS and WiFi to prevent excessive battery use when I don't need those things. It also has a very loud, clear speaker phone.This phone is also EXTREMELY durable.  I have never used hard cases or screen protectors and although I have dropped it on concrete more times than I can count, left it unprotected in my purse, and never really been careful with it, it has ZERO scratches on the screen and only slight scuffs around the edges of the phone itself.  The most it does when dropped is reboot, but then works fantastic and again NEVER gets cracked or scratched.  The keyboard is fully intact and to this day works just as well as the day I bought it.My only problems with it are it's old OS (gingerbread) which limits the apps I can download, and only very recently (the last 2 months, so nearly 23 months after purchase with extended use and mistreatment) has it begun to have issues with dropping calls, and occasionally the in call speaker doesn't work so I have to switch it to speaker phone to hear the other end of my call, but the other person can hear me just fine so the mike is still great.  Both of these problems, I don't attribute to the phone itself, more to my mistreatment where I dropped it into about an inch of water, speaker side down. After drying it in a bowl of rice for a few hours it's had those problems, but again I blame myself for that, not the phone. Again, VERY DURABLE.  I also wish it weren't 3G, but as with the old OS, it's just the age of the technology.I like the MOTOBLUR feature it comes with, which if GPS is enabled, will allow you to find your lost phone from your computer.  It also saves your contacts so if you need to reset your phone (I've never had to) or upgrade, you can easily send all contacts and sim card stored data easily to another device.The charging port is still perfect, though over time has become sensitive to low quality or old and frayed chargers.  I've found that replacing the charger is what fixes the problem, not the phone itself.I'm sad that they don't have an upgraded version of this phone now that my upgrade is due, but when I upgrade to a full touchscreen later this month, it will be an easier transition that it might have been without having a part-touch phone.  I plan to hang on to this one since it is still working relatively well even after all my misuse and it's age, just in case my newer phone has problems or gets lost or breaks.  I'm a little worried the charm has spoiled me in not needing to protect my phone for fear of damage due to its durability :)If you're looking for a phone that lasts, is a nice bridge between new and old technology and is text friendly, look no further than the Motorola Charm.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "alvin", "ReviewID": "R36UXRCA4ZV5PV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not very tech savvy and in the beginning had a hard time figuring everything out but after my teenager showed me a few things I'm having a lot of fun with this phone.
