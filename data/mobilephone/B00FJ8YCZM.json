It has a long lasting battery, an unbelievable HD display, an easier than ever to use stylus, and an infared remote control that can control any tv and cable box.

Johnson \"Zepaw\"", "ReviewID": "R2VS4RH4MY0EI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a fan of the bigger sized phones for some time and Samsung has been paving the way in terms of quality large phones. I remember when I had the 4.5in screened Samsung Infuse and it was considered large. I've had a Note and Note 2 and loved both. Note 3 continues the tradition of keeping everything that worked, improving where needed, and adding features I wouldn't have even thought to ask. So many of the little annoyances I had with my Note 2 have been addressed.  Its clear they put a lot of thought into finding out what people loved and wanted changed.When I first held the phone I fell in love. The form factor is just great and the screen is a noticeable jump up. That's saying something when the Note 2 already had a stellar screen resolution. I don't feel the need to have this one in a case. The slippery back of the Note 2 required a case as I dropped it a couple times when holding it bare.Rather than go on feature by feature I'll suffice to say everything feels like a great and noticeable improvement. S-pen, camera, screen, on and on its the phone I loved before but better in every way I could have asked for. I've tried dozens of smartphones over the past 5 years. The Note 2 was the first one I actually held onto for a year. I easily see myself holding onto the 3 that much or longer (depending on when they bring out a 4th ;) ).I highly recommend this phone.*Update a week in. I'm still just as impressed with this phone if not more so. The biggest thing I've found since my review is how much battery this phone offers. The battery size is insignificantly larger than the Note 2 which means they really improved the performance greatly to have increased battery efficiency this much. With the Note 2 most days of average us (lots of music streaming but not much else) I'd be about out of battery by end of work 5pm-ish. Now I'm at around 50%. I can make it through a full day without charge using the phone a good amount throughout. I did a test a couple days ago purposefully trying to drain it as fast as possible. Screen on high brightness near continuously while downloading several GB of data over 4G and it lasted over 6 hours! I remain extremely happy I got this phone.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sprint resolved the sound quality problems with Note 3!", "Author": "Suresh Varala", "ReviewID": "R3Z63PJ6WKZSH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved this phone from initial go but as many complained, I had issues with voice quality issues too on Sprint network.

In addition... the phone it self is amazing! Have several in my office who have already switched from their new I-phone 5s's to the Note 3 after seeing what it does. It may seem large at first, but you get use to it quickly. Considering it allows me to leave my note-pad behind, that I have been carrying around for over 20 years, I actually gained pocket space... a whole empty pocket. I am in sales so I have to be able to take notes on the fly, stock numbers, customers names, pricing etc. This thing is a God-send! I live in Roswell GA so the 4G-LTE service from Sprint is great. Buy this phone... you won't regret it, but be sure to learn all it will do. It will amaze you! It will pay for itself in productivity gains.

One of the reviewers alluded to the fact that their S2 Epic Touch was basically unusable for GPS/Location services along with a host of other problems. This is true because I had the same issues. When the phone was upgraded to Jellybean from Gingerbread, battery life was 2-3 hours and there's tons of information online about how Sprint and Samsung basically failed to support that phone and/or fix it's issues.I ended up selling it and bought a Photon which served me well until I got a S3. The S3 was great and I passed along to a family member when I got the Note 2. The Note 2 was by far the BEST phone I'd ever used. It eliminated my need for a tablet and I pretty much turned on my laptop in the rare instance that I needed a full 15 inch screen for work. That's how good the phone was, with amazing battery life, solid performance, and an absolutely reliable background. The only thing that disappointed me was the screen resolution...it was good, but it wasn't great when I compared it next to the HTC One or S4.I was so excited for the Note 3 that I sold my Note 2 for $400 and bought the Note 3 off contract for $700. I figured the $300 I was paying was equal to what I would have paid if I had an upgrade that was available. Initially I was in awe of this device. It was everything that the Note 2 was, but improved. I rarely make calls because I usually use messaging so I didn't expect anything to be wrong with the most basic part of the phone. This past week, I've had to make quite a few phone calls for work and that's when I noticed the problems. I looked up, \"Sprint Note 3 call problem\" and ran into a slew of forums and websites stating this issue.On one Android specific site, the reviewer even said that during his review period, the phone made flawless calls. Just this past week, he hasn't been able to make any calls.This may be a software/network issue but Sprint seems to be completely dropping the ball. There's no reassurance to the people who bought this phone and they strangely deleted a thread on their own community forum that they started, which basically said they were looking into the matter. Now, why would they go through the trouble to post that, and then delete it the next day?This is a fantastic device, but it's not a phone. A phone is something you can make and receive calls with. As it currently stands, you can't with this version of the Note 3. Check online and research before you buy this. I'm unable to return my phone because I bought it off contract and am hoping a fix is issued. If that happens I'll change my review, but until then STAY AWAY!", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Be Aware of this issue before you purchase sprint note 3", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R1PL9S6OK0P33M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Lakewood CA.

I thought it was a near perfect phablet, except for just two main areas for improvement: Screen resolution/sunlight legibility, and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed. Now that I have the Note 3, things are getting very very interesting....Lets do this review by bulletin points for easier viewing:PROS:1) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen. There are a handful of improvements:* The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p(from 720p). You can noticeably tell that it is crisper.* You will also find out that it is a bit brighter. For us geeks, that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max(when auto brightness is turned on).* Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2. However, it is still not as good as the HTC One's screen. The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels(velvety deep blacks). As a whole however, and because of its Pentile pixel system, it comes just a bit short of the HTC One's Super LCD 3. It is really nitpicking though, so you won't ever regret this.2) This phone flies, almost literally. The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag, and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart's content!3) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note. Too much to describe all the functions, and you can do without it for most functions. But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4) All those software features! Granted, you can do without most of them for day-to-day things, but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use. The are also too many to go through all, I but what I love most is the Smart-Stay, which uses the front camera to monitor that you're looking at the screen and won't dim/turn off, which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages, etc., holding the phone up with one hand, and your other hand is pre-occupied. No more having to shuffle around to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up. This is especially and specifically useful for me when I'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app.5) The sound is noticeably louder as well. It doesn't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One's dual stereo speakers, but by itself it is louder. This is useful when you are in a noisy environment, and having one loud speaker is more useful than having two immersive speakers that are softer and harder to hear. As good as the HTC One sounds, I hate that for most things like music and video, it is so darn soft and frustrating. I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use.6) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it, and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I'm in bed at night. The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME. I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20% will already be gone. And when I charge it, it trickle charges like a turtle! With the Note 3, being able to replace the battery is an added plus, and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly. But even these two advantages cannot compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place.CONS:There are few things you can nitpick, like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy, not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones. With rumors of a new Galaxy line, this may be changed very soon though. Also, the Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. Luckily, being Android means we'll never have to settle. My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look, is Smart Launcher Pro. Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I can't think of much else really to fault this phone, except for the fact that simply for what it is: It's a niche machine that's half tablet/half phone - it will never satisfy you as a tablet replacement(I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range), and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it, and do all the things you need one-handed(I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S). But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is, then there is no better alternative. This is a nearly flawless phablet with an brilliant screen, powerful hardware, useful software, and awesome battery life.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely love this phone!", "Author": "Socrates", "ReviewID": "RWL0CC2J8XK2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgraded two lines on our family account with this phone!

Check my video review for review of phone, some apps and GPS capability at the end. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone.  It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 2 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them. Phones don't get obsoleted. The previous gen phones still make phone calls and take great pictures as they did on day 1. Both Galaxy Note 2 and 3 have Micro-SIM. I have played around with a Note 3 and using on a regular basis and it is gorgeous phone in itself. The following paragraph applies to buying unlocked phones..DISPLAY: Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen.Note 3 has 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm (5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in) and weight 168 g (5.93 oz).Note 2 has Dimensions 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4 mm (5.95 x 3.17 x 0.37 in) and Weight: 183 g (6.46 oz).Note that it has become slightly less taller and 15 gm lighter! This is great as weight is a very important factor in handholding and for long uses. Both the phones have excellent S Pen stylus.Note 3 has 1920 x 1080 pixels, 5.7 inches (~386 ppi pixel density).Note 2 is 1280x720 pixels, 5.5 inches (~267 ppi pixel density).

It is a delight for note taking purposes. I have used Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, Galaxy Tab 2/3 and I really love the Galaxy series. I can see the high end smartphones really getting saturated. For users with Note II or S4, I will not recommend upgrading unless you always want the latest and the greatest. You still have a great phone and it is not outdated just because Note III has come out. Your camera takes just great pictures as it did last month. Just like Detroit/Japan rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades. If you have a different phone or a low end phone or you are from that iSomething world, welcome to Galaxy series!Battery life is good.  The video playback was crisp. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs. I am not that annoyed with the Samsungware as I really like S-Health and some other apps. Mainly note taking apps are awesone.  People of course can root and put Cyanogenmod at some point later.I used to put a 64 GB microSDXC card SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging for video/song/ebooks.  I have since upgraded to 128 GB MicroSD and it works great! No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are: AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.Note III infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. Games were very buttery. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Smooth and Stunning display! NFC works awesome. I use a Qi charger with a Qi wireless receiver and they work great as well.Some Extra Accessories:NFC has lot of use cases. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAldiko Premium and Kindle Reading AppsAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoiceTemple Run series of gamesPlenty of WidgetsAPPENDIX: If you are comparing multiple phones, here is the quick highlevel breakdown of top phones as of mid 2014.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance.  External storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don't advertise or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version): 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.Ask questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy Note III.

The greatest drawback of the phone is its size which can make its use pretty cumbersome and outright difficult with one hand even with the one handed feature.

Great if you are willing to put in some time to optimize it. Software suffers from having 3 masters: Samsung, Google and wireless carrier(in my case Sprint). Everyone wants you to use their store and apps. My advice is to use Google (it is an android phone after all) and add the other bits as you need them. If you're really ambitious troll YouTube for Note 3 tips and techniques.If you prefer phone use with one hand there are special setting to shrink and move the buttons to facilitate that. But I'd recommend a Galaxy S4 or iPhone instead.Update 06/06/2014Still love the hardware.  The software or rather the battle with the software providers is getting on my nerves.  For example, picture handling is totally out of control. Google started automatically downloading my pictures to my google+ account. Samsung would like to but I don't have a Samsung specific account. Dropbox has to be stopped from automatically doing this.  What I really want is to download pictures to my computer where I can edit them. Simple huh? Well not in this new world. Android phones and Mac computers don't like each other. If you want to do what THEY want you to do, life is a trip down a water slide. If you want to do something else its a climb UP a water slide.Also:  car chargers are an issue for this phone.

It's a little difficult to handle with one hand, but you'll get used to it over time. I thought the S4 was large, but hold a Note 3 and see the difference! The call quality is AWFUL, unfortunately! This is one of the most popular phones on the market and the last thing anyone would think would be wrong with the phone is the call quality. The calls are fuzzy and are in and out all of the time.

A few random thoughts:1. Compared the screen quality to my friends Galaxy S4 yesterday and the Note 3 blows it away - SO much more vibrant, the screen just pops, the s4, which is a great screen with even higher pixel density, looks dull in comparison. (on identical brightness, wallpaper, and screen mode)2. I know this sounds childish but I get a visceral rush just looking and using the huge, luscious screen. It seems to be the prefect size to give you that tablet effect - that invitation to sit back and actually get absorbed in the experience a la the iPad - while not being too big to carry and use for utilitarian purposes too. Sure, an iPad mini or Kindle would be even more inviting but carrying those things around is problematic. Your phone is with you at all times. The bottom line for me is that this is a very acceptable and practical compromise, YMMV.3. My first new phone in two years and I'm very impressed with how much snappier and responsive it is because of the chip developments. I'm sure that would be the case with any new high end phone but rest assured that this flagship Samsung phone has the latest and greatest guts and snaps with the best of em. I am more inclined to use various features because I know there will be no clunky snafu or delay.4. The stylus is a welcome novelty (even beyond the nostalgia it gives me for my old Windows Mobile phone) So many nice things you can do with it. Draw a circle around any web content and it's 'scrapbooked'. Draw a rectangle on the screen and you can open an app IN that rectangle. I use it to draw up complex estimates in my home service business and then add a photo to the estimate on the same note and it automatically syncs with Evernote! This is an estimators dream. If you are sitting back at the coffee shop intent on surfing your phone a while try actually using the stylus instead of your finger.  As a typing and tapping tool it is undoubtedly more accurate and rapid than a thick finger tip, so why not? Sure, to the other Starbuckers this will mark you as a non Apple outlier but so what, don't follow the herd, think different!5. Call and sound quality - I see where apparently some people have had issues with call quality but I have had no issues. Perhaps this is a Sprint only issue? So far so good on Verizon.  If you think maybe you would like the Note 3 but are holding back for fear it will be unwieldy I say go ahead and get it. It's light as a feather and you get quickly used to the size. It will of course never be as easy to whip about as a smaller phone so you will have to weigh the loss of a little agility against the increased usability and joy of having a tablet in your pocket at all times.
