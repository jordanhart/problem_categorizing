It was and in most cases a beautiful phone. I have indeed felt proud to have had it accompany me everywhere I go as it fitted into my formal, semi-formal or casual attires very well. I was never uncomfortable to place it on my desk in front of me though on silent mode during meetings with my colleagues, business-partners or supervisors regardless of the forum; Beautifully crafted indeed. I have however since upgraded it to the 5c and I am very pleased with the upgrade, especially since Apple has also upgraded the charging system on the new 5th generations of iPhones, the Apple Lightning to USB Cable. This was my only negative in terms of longevity of the charging cables on the 4th and previous generations of iPhones.I believed that the point where the cable connected to the adaptor system used to insert into the previous generations of phone was compromised in its design as that part seemed to have been a weak point in the system, resulting in breakages and separations of the internal connection leads from the adaptor due to handlings resulting in failures in the charging system, thus in most cases I had to resort to use of the accessory ducting port system instead of regularly charging the phone through its accompanied charging cable system.This connector now upgraded to the Apple Lightning to USB Cable system on the 5th generation iPhones and iPad-4 is welcomed indeed, though it may seem small and un-noticeable, its welcome indeed.Apple in its iPhone 5c continued to display the commitment to provide improved services to its clients with its taught-fully designed, elegantly crafted and user-friendly products. Well-done Apple.
