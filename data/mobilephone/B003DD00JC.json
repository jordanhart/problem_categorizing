{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Palm Pre Plus Review from Centro User", "Author": "M. Klaus", "ReviewID": "RRMNY1S57ZAG6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received my Palm Pre Plus from AT&T; about two weeks ago. I have owned a Palm Centro for a couple of years now, and I naively expected the same functionality from the Pre Plus that I enjoyed with my Centro. That really was my fault as I didn't do enough homework on the features and functions of this phone compared to the traditional Palm OS.Physically, the phone felt comfortable in my hands. It wasn't heavy enough to be burdensome, but it wasn't so light that it felt like a toy. The keys have the traditional clear overlay that protects the letters, and they are a bit larger and better spaced than on my Centro or Treo 650. I was very pleased with the slide out keyboard.Learning to navigate the phone via the swipe motions took about three or four days to become totally natural. It would have been much easier if Palm had included better instructions with the phone, but the included manual contained little more than instructions on how to turn it on, answer a call, etc.Setting up the necessary software to customize the phone was moderately challenging, even though I am one of two of my school's officially labeled \"geeks\". Web OS seemed to me to have been shipped prematurely. There are many wonderful customizations available, but you have to download several programs and rely on what's called \"Homebrew Apps\" or third-party software for the features that old-school Palm users take for granted. For example, there is no custom ringtone for unknown callers, no options for reminders, no easy scrolling through a text message to quickly fix an error in the line above, limited or no brightness options, etc.Traditional Palm software for the Centro and Treo phones will not work on WebOS. You can buy an app for the Pre that will allow you to run some (but not all) Palm OS apps on the Pre.There is no included phone-to-pc sync option. For me and many other Centro/Treo users, this was a BIG deal. There is an app that will allow you to back up your Pre to your desktop, BUT the the traditional hot sync is not available on WebOS. The phone comes with Google calender sync installed, but any attempt to sync Google Calender, the Pre, AND Outlook will result in possibly hundreds of duplicate event entries. There is third-party software you can purchase to allow a full sync with Outlook, but it can cost as much as $60-$70. Even those software options do not back up your media to your computer. You are on your own with that one.Another nasty surprise was the missed call notification. When the Pre informs you that you have missed a call, a tap on the screen will open up the dialog that lets you know whose call you missed. Unfortunately, it immediately dials the number of the missed call AT THE SAME TIME. It is really unpleasant to be in the middle of a meeting or other activity and find yourself trying to explain to your mother that you really didn't mean to call her back right then or why you felt compelled to call her and hang up.As they say in the world of Pre, though: There's a patch for that. In other words, you can download system tweaks that change many of the basic functions of the Pre and make it more user-friendly. While I think that's great, I also believe that most of it shouldn't be necessary.On the bright side, should you brick your phone playing around with Homebrew (unofficial freeware) apps or patches, Palm has available for download Web Doctor. This script will restore your phone to factory specs, erasing everything except what your Pre shipped factory with. When you sync with your Palm account, your address book, Palm store apps, and a few other things will be restored. Your media, however, is gone forever unless you have used USB mode to access your media folders and backed them up manually or used a cloning app to copy your Pre data for restore.There is no removable memory option. The Pre comes with 16g on-board drive space, and that's it. It offers the option to choose \"charge\" or \"Use in usb mode\" when you plug in the included USB charging cable.While the battery life is terrible, there has been a sharp drop in the price of charging accessories. The Touchstone (a cable-less charger) has dropped from the $70 range to around $20 shipping and all here on Amazon. There has likewise been a similar drop in the price of car chargers, AC to USB converters, and replacement batteries.An item of note: The batteries for the Pre are physically indistinguishable from Centro batteries with the exception of the black outer packaging that the Pre battery comes in. Palm says that you are not to use Centro batteries in the Pre, but they have not as yet made an official statement as to why. They only warn you that using a Centro battery in a Pre can damage your phone. They just won't tell you how. This is especially frustrating as not only are the two batteries both listed at 1150mAh, but there is a substantial price difference between the two - not to mention that many Pre users already have a ton of Centro batteries lying around gathering dust. If you ever get bored, you can always head over to one of the Pre message boards on the web and get the Pre/Centro battery argument going (again). You'll have more entertainment than you can stand, I promise.There are many features of the Pre that made the phone worth the (mostly initial) aggravation. The ability to minimize apps, leaving them open as you open another, is wonderful. As I don't have the best data access in my location, I can open the web browser and leave it minimized while I send a text or record an event into my calender. It comes GPS enabled, and while the AT&T; GPS servie is extra, Google maps is not.The browser is incredibly easy to use, and it offers several short-cut options that put your favorite sites within single tap availability. It also switches between apps quickly and easily without forcing you to start from the beginning in each one. It also still threads chat messages.You get thirty days of free phone support with your new phone, and after thirty days, phone support is about $15 an hour. Chat support is always free.The Pre Plus is is a great geek phone that with many options available for customization - including many free themes. It can get expensive buying the apps that many Centro users have felt should have been included with the phone, however, and setting up the customization will be beyond the comfort zone of may users. While the battery life is abysmal, chargers and replacement batteries are becoming more affordable. The graphics are stunningly clear and sharp, the screen is an optimal size in relation to the device, and the versatility of functioning as a thumb drive is an added plus.In summary, the crux of it is this: it has a mixed bag of positives and negatives, and the way you will feel about it will be directly related to the degree of tech-savvy that you have. If you are a Treo or Centro user who is upgrading, don't expect a great (or even pleasant) out-of-the-box experience, and you need to be prepared to shell out additional $$ for third-party software needed to complete the functionality of the phone. For me, that meant spending about $100 on additional software to allow me to sync, run some classic apps, and to replace a couple of old favorites that just wouldn't run on an emulator.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy This Phone", "Author": "Dave N.", "ReviewID": "R2HR7K5YTPYPZA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned a Palm Pre for over a year now. In January, I will upgrade to a different phone, quite happily. Bad reviews are fun to write, because you can be sarcastic and snide. I write this review with a heavy heart. I wanted to have a good experience with this phone. It replaced a Palm Treo, which in turn replaced my Palm Pilot.I should start with the good: The Pre was the very first phone to actually multitask, so that two or more applications could run at once. The screen is generally bright, if small (3.1 inches, compared with 3.4 inches for the iPhone and 4.3 inches for many Android devices). Once you get used to it, the keyboard is acceptable, if small and a bit cramped. The camera takes relatively decent photos for 3 megapixels.The mediocre: While it synchs nicely with my Gmail calendar, if I am entering an appointment time on the phone itself, I have to use an awkward \"wheel\" for any starting time other than the top of the hour. I have gotten used to it, but still find this feature annoying.Now the bad: I am actually on my second Palm Pre. The first one needed replacement when the only way I could accept calls was through the external speaker. The second, replacement phone, will only power on when I pull up the slider bar and expose the keyboard. The top \"on/off\" button works for putting the phone in \"vibrate mode,\" but nothing else.Additionally, the cover to the micro USB port on both phones was flimsy and broke off. Last week, the MP3 player decided it no longer wanted to play when I wanted to listen through headphones. Even before then, the volume control (on both phones) was abysmal.Battery life is terrible. My phone ran out of power, in airplane mode, while listening to music on a 3 hour flight. When doing web searches, the phone becomes hot -- much hotter than other devices I have used. The charging dock is a good concept for charging the phone, though I have discovered it is easier to charge simply by plugging it in.The Worst: WebOS, while innovative, has been abandoned by its current owner, Hewlett-Packard. As a result, the operating system itself is not being updated. Additionally, there is no incentive for developers to actually create apps for WebOS devices. Where both Apple and Android can claim to literally have hundreds of thousands of downloadable apps, WebOS has under 10,000. While nobody has an use for most of the Apple and Android Apps, certain ones, like Shazam or barcode scanners, are invaluable -- and not to be found in the WebOS catalog.So here's the bottom line: You can spend $50 to $100 for a Palm Pre Plus, and quite possibly have all the problems I have had with my two, or you can get something else. I suggest the \"something else.\"", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love my Pre", "Author": "Puddlejumper", "ReviewID": "R1I0EOIHHM571M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I absolutely love my Palm Pre. The syncing feature works quite well, and keeps my gmail, facebook, and phone contacts always up to date with the latest numbers. The integration with email is seamless, and although the app store is not quite as extensive as the iPhone, the Pre has a hardware keyboard which works flawlessly. The tethering capabilities of the phone work nicely, and for a connection on the go it comes in handy with a laptop. The mirror on the back of the phone I have found quite useless, and the sliding of the keyboard in and out leaves marks on the mirror. The camera quality is quite nice for a phone when used with low motion items, however things get blurry with little motion. Video recording works rather well, and picks up audio quite nicely. The storage is more than enough for plenty of pictures and video.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best phone ever", "Author": "ETD", "ReviewID": "R1JXYR2BUM38NN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To bad it was Palm's \"hail Mary\", and it didn't go as well as they wanted it to.  And now that Hewlett Packard has purchased Palm, and is all but ignoring this phone, it's quickly degrading to the point where it will be nearly useless before it actually wears out.  Sad ... like I say, this \"was\" the best phone ever.Addendum:  HP has now disabled Google Maps on this phone, and re-routes any requests for map information to \"Bing\".  This also disables dozens and dozens of other apps that depended on the Google Maps API.  Hewlett Packard has gone beyond simply ignoring this phone, and is now actively disrupting it's original functionality.  There are class action law suits in the works, but nothing will ever come of them.

This phone is the Colecovision of video game systems.  A hidden gem nobody will ever remember but one of the most fascinating pieces of technology to ever be created.  My Palm fell apart a few months ago, and I tried out the iphone for several months.  Yes the iphone is better, but because I have a MAC it's also redundant.  I just sold and bought a used Palm for 18 dollars and quite frankly couldn't be happier.  I know it's not as fast as the iphone and doesn't have the app support, but it really satisfies all the basic needs of a smartphone, is more stylish and fits nicely in the pocket.  I also like the physical keyboard.  The app situation isn't all grim either.  There are the social media basics and then there are some fantastic home brews.  This is where the Pre is like the Colecovision--I predict dedicated fans are going to be making apps for this thing for years to come.  It's also nice to know if I break my phone it's going to cost 18 dollars to replace and not 800.  I'll stick with this for another year at least.

Good build quality and decent battery life.  The call quality leaves more to be desired as well as the speakerphone volume is a bit weak.

My carrier is Verizon and the Palm Pre was one of the phones I could get for free with a renewal of my 2 year contract.  The advantage of owning this particular phone is that it is a smart phone and has all the perks of a smart phone.  However, here are some of the disadvantages:It takes the phone literally 3-5 minutes to start up when you restart or turn the phone on.  God forbid there was an emergency where you'd need to call 911 and your phone happened to be off.When viewing previous text messages if you scroll up too quickly it doesn't show some of the messages.The buttons are tiny.  I have small fingers but it took me awhile to get used to typing and even now, I have to use my fingernails to completely depress the buttons.Moving the face (screen) up too quickly can cause the phone to turn off by itself.This very morning a message popped up on my lovely Palm Pre phone stating I was no longer signed into my Palm profile and I would need to restart it. I did nothing out of the ordinary to cause this to happen. There was no option of simply getting rid of the message without restarting so I did.  It then acted like an unactivated phone.  I had to re-enter all my passwords, and lost all my saved text messages.  Luckily the contacts were automatically saved on my gmail account but now my contact list also includes 200 people from my facebook account that I have no desire to have in my phone's contact list.  When contacting Palm, they of course, could do nothing, not even tell me why it could have happend.  I've had this phone for about a year and a half and cannot wait to get rid of it.

I previously had a Palm Pilot, a Song Clie (w/ Palm OS), and a Palm Centro.  I loved them all.  The OS was great and I have built up a large list of contact and personal information that I keep in my phone (safe and securly).  This was my main reason to continue using Palm OS.This is what you may expect to find in the Palm Pre that will be missing:You have to use the touch screen.  Have to.  There is no longer a cursor button.  FYI this makes editing a line of text, i.e. cusor movement to go back a few letters to make a correction, very challenging.Contact groups (categories) are gone, you cannot display contacts by group.  The concept of groups doesn't exist.You can't search all records.  You can search for a record name, but the full-text search that would also search the text of notes within records is gone.There is no private record.  You can password protect the phone.  However if you previously enjoyed being able to hide private records instead of entering a password every time you turned on your phone you will be disappointed as it is not possible anymore.Notes attached to a contact will be displayed as raw <html> unless you edit the record.The battery life is HORRIBLE.  My Palm Centro would last 4-5 days before a re-charge.  My Palm Pre can barely make it through ONE day.  I have followed all of the Palm recommendations to reduce battery use.There are no birthday alarms.  If you have contacts with a birthday and expect it to notify you of the event in advance you will be disappointed, that feature doesn't exist on the Pre.Problems I've had with my Palm Pre:Sometimes the alarm clock doesn't work.  Yes - that's right, it is unreliable.  Do an internet search on that topic and you will see lots of other people who have experienced it too.Sometimes the phone doesn't ring or mostly - text messages don't make a sound when they are received.  This is not user error, the phone is not on silent and a message sound is enabled for txt messages.Sometimes the phone shutsdown.  There is no notification when your phone just shuts down.  You won't know until you go to use your phone and when you turn it on it goes through the boot sequence (which takes a few minutes - it's not fast).Frequently the phone intermittently hangs while in use, then suddenly all of the actions you have done (or were attempting to do) happen all at once.  You need to excercise patience when the phone doesn't respond right away.  It takes some getting used to.The antenna strength is poor compared to my Centro.What I like about it:The screen brightness and resolution is better then anything I've had before.Email and web browsing is acceptable.There are some clever and entertaining games that take advantage of the motion sensing technology.Customer support is good.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed (former) Palm customer", "Author": "Bob Kline", "ReviewID": "R2LLQXH9XRC3AL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had been a loyal Palm customer for quite a few years, upgrading regularly, purchasing Palm devices for other family members, and very appreciative of the features for which Palm had at one time been the market leader.  So when my mobile phone needed replacement about a year ago it didn't take much convincing for me to get a Palm Pre Plus.  Between business and social life I had accumulated over a thousand contacts in my Palm address book, and I had come to depend on the excellent support I got from the Palm in organizing, searching, and retrieving that information.  Nearly as important was the exceptional calendar software on the Palm for keeping tracking of all my meetings and appointments.  I was attracted by the prospect of continuing with the company which had provided all of these superb tools, now to be combined with my mobile phone so that I could now carry around one device instead of two.  It never occurred to me that Palm would throw away all of the development in which it had invested over the years and replace it with a significantly inferior platform.  I won't go into all of the details of features Palm dropped on the floor (contact categories, desktop sync, full text searching, structured storage of postal addresses, etc.): other reviewers here have already cataloged those.  Eventually I resigned myself to the feature downgrade and tried to make the best of the situation by taking advantage of other new capabilities which the previous Palm devices hadn't had, in particular the ability to schedule jobs, which I used to have the Pre send a nightly copy of my contact information to my desktop workstation.  However, even these new features were broken, as I found out when the device silently turned off all of the scheduled tasks any time it was powered down, which happened more and more frequently as the battery became increasingly unreliable.  The really serious problems kicked in as I approached the end of the first year with the device.  The calendar started losing or garbling event information: I'd enter a weekly meeting and it would just disappear as soon as I saved it.  For other appointments the Palm Pre would silently change the date: I would schedule something for the following Tuesday and the Pre would save it for Wednesday instead.  The device also started shutting itself down unpredictably: one minute the battery would report that it had a 40 percent charge remaining, and 60 seconds later it changed its mind and said there was 0 percent power left and was turning itself off.  Reporting all of these problems was a waste of time: Palm no longer seems to care about customer support or tracking down and fixing bugs.  So after a year of struggling to live with all the defects I finally gave up last week and replaced the device.

I've found that while switching between apps is quite easy and fast, the phone sort of chokes when you receive a call while using an app. I've missed many calls due to this;-The screen scratches very easily. I've been very gentle with my phone, but somehow it has many scratches on it;-The camera does not perform well at all. Granted, I didn't buy the phone for the camera, but there have been times when I wished the camera performed a bit better. Also, because the cover of the lens is recessed in the back of the phone it is very difficult to clean off the lens without completely removing the back cover;-The app market for Palm users isn't nearly as robust for Droid or iPhone users. Again, this isn't something that completely ruins the phone for me, but it might be for others.The phone has performed well as a phone, but given the amount of negatives I've found during the year I've owned it would not make me want to purchase another Palm phone.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pros and Cons of The PALM.", "Author": "Annette", "ReviewID": "R1V5H7CZZ2PLST", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS:*There are many default apps loaded on, such as: phone, email, camera, contacts, memos, tasks, calander, videos, google maps, clock, music, photos, App Catalog, calculator, web, Youtube, Amazon Mp3, updates and more.*The app store is great on the phone. You can easily download apps right from your phone, on to your phone. There is a wide selection of free apps as well.*The size is great. You can fit it anywhere; your pockets, purse, etc. However, I think this phone is directed towards females because of the size of the keys. You need to have small fingers to be able to use the keys.CONS:*Don't order cases online for this phone! There is a sensor at the top, which some cases cover up. When this censor is covered, the phone shuts off during a call. I got my case from a kiosk at the mall.*Text messages take FOREVER to come through! A few minutes, maybe. Very inconvienent.*Slow internet connection. It is faster if hooked up to Wifi, though.OVERALL:*This was my first phone, and I've had it replaced three times. One, because I dropped it on the floor and the screen shattered. (USE A CASE AT ALL TIMES!) Two, because the second phone they sent me didnt work quite right (The B Key was stuck!) and three, because I had way to many apps loaded on at the same time. (Helpful Hint: Don't open more than five cards (aka windows) at the same, or else the phone goes crazy!)*I don't know why I am so attached to this phone. It is very basic, and does everything I wanted it to do.*The connections are just SLOW.*I would recommend this for teenagers (because of their hand size and what they want in a phone)Please 'LIKE' or 'DISLIKE'.

I loved the look and feel of the phone.  The only problem with the phone was the lack of applications.  I was previously using a regular cell phone and a separate PDA for a calendar and task list.  I wanted to upgrade to one device.  The problem was there were no decent calendar applications for the WEBOS.  You can buy a program that will let you use the old Palm OS programs, but they really looked old fashioned.  After about 2 weeks, I decided to go with an Android phone.  So far it is going great; I am still learning how to use it.Also, the battery life is not that great.  I am not a heavy cell phone user, but I had to charge it every day.

This is not a problem with my battery, it is a problem with all Palm batteries. I keep idiotically buying new ones hoping for a different result, and it's always the same.2) The app store is frozen. I was bored one day and went onto it to download some new games, and the installs keep failing. Now every time I turn on my phone (see also: #7) there is an extra few minutes I have to wait for my phone to attempt to install those games, fail, and notify me of its failure so that I can get rid of said notification. Every time I try to go onto the app store to unpurchase those games (which is, rather stupidly, the ONLY way to get rid of them), the app store just freezes, so not only can I not download anymore apps now, but this process of waiting for my phone to fail six installs every time I turn it on is now a permanent feature.3) The alarm clock is broken. If I try to set more than two alarms, all of them will mysteriously be reset to go off at the same time as a random one in the group. \"So then,\" you might ask, \"why not just set two alarms a little extra early and keep snoozing them?\" Glad you asked! Half the time, if you hit the snooze button, the phone mistakes it for dismiss, then realizes its mistake 22 MINUTES LATER. A lot of good that does when you have a 9:30 meeting to attend.4) The 3G is so slow, I can only use it in situations in which I am willing to wait a full five minutes per loading screen.5) People often tell me during phone calls that I sound muffled or far away.6) The send button for texts and e-mails is delayed and often bugs out, sending the same text three times and then opening the pictures folder because it thought maybe I wanted to send a picture.7) Speaking of which, only sends/receives pictures successfully about half the time via text. Only succeeds about 10% of the time via internet.8) Takes FOREVER to turn on.Seriously. Don't give these people your money. You're not buying a smart phone. There are so many bugs that you would literally be better off with a flip phone.

I wanted a smart phone, namely an iphone BUT I would have had to cough up about $200 to upgrade to an iphone whereas I could get this Palm Pre Plus for free.  The only change in cost would be that I would have to get a data plan for at least $15/month.  At first, I loved it because going from a \"non-smart\" phone to a smart phone is great.  However, I began to notice that the signal strength was poor anytime I was in my home.  This resulted in calls being dropped CONSTANTLY.  Or at times, when people tried to call me, the phone wouldn't even ring, the call would go straight to voice mail and eventually I would discover I had the voicemail.I called Palm who wanted to blame the problem on AT&T;'s coverage.  I knew that wasn't the problem because we (husband & I) had both had cell phones with great signal strength previously through AT&T.;  The problem only existed with the Palm.  So I was on the phone for an hour and a half or so troubleshooting trying all kinds of things.  Nothing worked.  To be fair, the last thing the Palm customer service people suggested was \"resetting\" the phone so it went back to its factory settings.  I didn't want to try that and didn't have any reason to believe that would work when nothing else did so I didn't do the reset.Today was the last straw.  I was at the doctor's office waiting for an appointment when my husband called.  I answered the call, noticed I had 0 bars of reception, and the call dropped before I could get 5 words in.  I tried to call him back to no avail.  There was no reception for the 2 hours or so I was inside the doctor's office building.  When I got outside, I attempted to call my husband back and again, even though I'm OUTDOORS--no reception.  Made the call but before we could say much of anything, the call dropped.  I can not wait to get rid of this useless garbage!!!Also, the camera on the phone lacks a zoom feature.When I had only had it for a few months, it mysteriously \"died.\"  It had a good charge and everything and when I picked it up, the screen was black & I couldn't get it to turn on.

Perhaps AT&T; doesn't want customers to know another of their phones has severe problems.  I can't rewrite it word for word, but I can come close, only this time I will be harsh about AT&T.;I've had this phone since October 2010.  I had a Palm Centro before, and while the Pre is very different, I liked it.  Then just a few months ago the bad started.First, dropped calls.  I've had many dropped calls and randomly get \"connecting...\" when attempting to make a call.  Sometimes it connects, sometimes it doesn't.  I thought it was because I moved to a new area, but since everyone else in my family has AT&T; as well and no trouble where I live, it's not the service, it's the phone.  Even more proof it is the phone is the fact that if I restart the phone I can connect fine... for awhile.  It's not that I don't have service - my bars will be almost full and I still will have trouble.  Once the phone even went into SOS mode for no reason.  A restart fixed that right away.  Restarting once in awhile is fine, but to have to do it so many times is ridiculous, especially since it takes so long to start up.Second, texting trouble.  Whether or not my texts are sent I don't know.  I know one of my friends doesn't always get them, but she had the same trouble when I had my Centro, so I think it's her Blackberry.  My main trouble is typing, though I have had errors when attempting to send a picture I took on my phone.  Again, a restart fixed the picture sending problem.  When my calls started to have trouble it wasn't long after that my keyboard started to not work correctly.  I either get no response or multiple letters when pressing some buttons.  My backspace button is probably the worst (likely because of how many times I have to use it to correct the typing errors), followed closely by \"e\".  Search the internet - this is a common problem.  I even tried a full erase hoping that would solve the problem (it is unknown if this is a hardware or software problem), but of course it did not help at all with the keyboard, which I figured but thought I'd try in the rare chance it would.The phone is a nice size, depending on the size of your hands, and the keyboard is nice (when it works).  It could have been a great phone if they would have worked out all the problems.  I guess someday I will have to go into my local AT&T; store (assuming there is one in this area) and complain.  In the past all I've got from them was a \"yeah, that phone has those problems\" and nothing else, so unless things have changed I guess I will have to find the charger for my Centro.  I still have a year until upgrade time, and I guarantee I will never again get a Palm as long as they are owned by HP.  I can't say I'm happy with AT&T; either, but I never was - I WAS happy with Cingular.  The only thing keeping me with AT&T; is the family plan I am part of because it saves us all some money.

In addition when trying to view missed calls the phone automatically redials the call so it is aggravating as you attempt to identify the caller without \"accidentially\" returning the call at an inconvenient time or place.
