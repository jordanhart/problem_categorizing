Well since my contract is over in October, I figured I would buy a cheap replacement phone just to last me until I can sign a new contract. BE WARNED! There are a few different reasons why this phone is so cheap. First of all, its a total brick. Weighs a ton, and is just about 3/4 of an inch thick. The buttons feel very cheap and overall it is just a truly ugly design. It has the side scrolling wheel, which is a nightmare in itself and can be difficult to use. Design and ease of use are definitely the 2 biggest flaws with this phone. But as far as functionality is concerned, this thing runs like a champ. For the 3 months that I have had this phone, it has NEVER dropped a single call and has never had any trouble sending/receiving text messages. The call clarity is very impressive and the speaker phone works wonderfully well.In conclusion, even though it is uglier that sin and feels like you have a fistful of rocks in your pocket, it does work very well. It has no fancy bells or whistles but it will do a damn fine job just making and receiving calls and texts.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "BIG DISAPOINTMENT", "Author": "L. A.
