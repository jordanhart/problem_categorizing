I wish the holes it has for earpiece and charging had some kind of cover. They are not covered so things can go inside. A friend tried sending me a picture but I did not receive it. Everything else works great. The size is perfect for me and is easy to text. So far I have not had any problems.I recommend the phone for basic use.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "An Excellent Phone with Qwerty Keyboard", "Author": "Paul \"wds\"", "ReviewID": "RQF8T2P60NVZ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am using the phones for the last 6 months.The good:(1) Good audio quality(2) Good Reception(3) Qwerty Keyboard(4) Easy to use(6) Bar Style(7) High Quality Camera(8) Easy to pair with BluetoothThe bad:Does not appear to be sync-friendly.Overall, it is an excellent phone for this price.

I only have to recharge the phone once a week at most, it is comfortable to hold and easy to text.  There is no way, not one way, to sync , backup, import or export contacts and messages to a PC.  Can't do it.  It only holds about 300 messages and when it fills up you can either delete less important ones one by one or you can delete every one.  Now you can fit dozens of photos on this phone, I have no idea why they wouldn't share the storage with the software that handles the messages.Given how nice the hardware is I'm very frustrated with the lack of backup and the limited message space.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Basic phone for a Senior", "Author": "Donn G.Collins", "ReviewID": "RG7PEAM7AQYR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this phone yesterday and placed my pure talk Sim card in place and I have enjoyed the phone ever since. No it's not an I phone but it is a well built phone for talking and texting. With the raised key QWERTY text messages were easy to send. With Motorola quality and at a price just over $ 40 this phone is hard to beat. With my pure talk plan of $ 15 a month for two phones it fits right into my budget. I will repeat it is a great phone for seniors who want to stay in contact with home.
