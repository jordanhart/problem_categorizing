Decent documentation.Phone pros: good/decent signal, good/decent call quality.  Good external numeric keypad.  Predictable battery life (2.5-3 days, though I talk maybe 1 hour in that time).  Got a spare battery off an online auction site for cheap.  Can use .wav files as ring tones (MP3 -> .wav via Audacity?  I haven't tried).  SOLID build.Phone cons: somewhat large (candy-bar with a big screen!), have to get used to the earpiece position (can't rest the phone on my ear)... And once, though the keypad was locked, the phone (slipped into my pant pocket) called up my friend.  Weird.  But that hasn't happened again.  Ringtones could be louder.PDA - I can sync my contacts with Outlook and keep track of my appointments, which is all I really want.  Have also managed to use Gmail via POP3; the VoqMail application does not support POP3.(For POP3, you have to enter the server IP address and port completely (pop.gmail.com:995, smtp.gmail.com:465), I had some trouble with that.  Internet connection via GPRS also has somewhat of a weird work-around - look up the cingular.com FAQ for setting up the Audiovox SMT5600 SmartPhone, nice screenshots.)PDA pros: QWERTY flip-out keypad good for notes, contacts, appointments.  My fingers are not slim, but not fat either - so I can enter data/SMS at a good pace.  SD expansion slot.  Windows Mobile 2003 SE actually, FWIW.  \"Flight\" mode - but I still turn it off in the plane!PDA cons: Has frozen (only!) a couple times in 3 months, can't find a reset pinhole, so took out the battery... (momentary flashback of my last PDA - a Toshiba e310).Have had the Sierra Voq for over three months now, happy camper.  Way better than the Motorola v180 (which it replaced) or the e310.  Now, if only I could get a decent non-leather cover for it... Too bad Sierra stopped production, but if they hadn't, I wouldn't be able to own this wonderful phone!

Feature wise it's right up there and of course it integrates seamlessly with Office via Activesync or over the internet.  Which does bring up the issue of configuring it.  I bought it for use with T-Mobile and I found it quite difficult to navigate which T-Mobile services I'd need to get all of the functionality on the phone - combined with the fact that since this phone is unsupported by T-Mobile, you'll need to manually configure the email/internet etc.  Finally got it all figured and now everything works well.  However, using all of the features will consume your battery.  Heavy usage of the email and internet features will mean a battery life of about 1 1/2 days.  Lighter use, or no use, brought it back up to about 3 days on standby.

The way I see it, if the battery lasts until I plug it in at night, with a little to spare, that's good enough.  I can see if they are flying all the time, but who is so lazy that plugging in their phone every night, as opposed to every three or so nights, is a big sleep-loosing issue?  I've ordered a car charger on Ebay, just in case, since at a moments notice I may find myself driving or flying cross-country.  As soon as I find a spare battery, I'll buy it, for the same reason.The phone is big, compared to my last phone, which wasn't a smartphone, didn't have a QWERTY keyboard, had a tiny screen, and didn't do anything other than place calls.  However, compared to other smartphones, it's about the right size, and feels good in the hand as well.  It's also much smaller than a PDA phone, or a PDA/cell phone/MP3 player/movie player cluster of devices that all need their own batteries, chargers, add-ons and doodads.  Frankly, nobody should be whining about the size, since the dimensions are clearly stated.  Doesn't anybody own a ruler?It is somewhat a pain to configure this phone for internet access.  According to Cingular, all their phones have some top-secret software installed that magically allows them to access the net.  Since their programmers didn't have a chance to work their voodoo on this phone, there's absolutely no chance that it'll work with their internet service.  Well, after a bit of fiddling with the settings, much trial and error, and looking at the settings of their other phones (available on their web site) it worked just fine.  I managed to view most web sites, except those with Shockwave animation, which seems to shut down the browser (same as my PocketPC).  CAUTION! I racked up [...] in internet charges with just a few minutes of browsing.  After you get it working, I strongly suggest you enroll in a data plan.As for some of the other issues folks complain about, there are three things to keep in mind:1) This phone is bought from a third party, and was never offered by any US service provider.  That means it is up to YOU to set everything up, or have that nerdy kid down the street do it for you.  It wasn't overly complex for me, and though I have some experience with networking, I am by no means a pro.2) There is a firmware update for this phone.  You much check out their web site for downloads and instructions.  As it is, my phone had the latest firmware, which was a very nice touch.3) This phone was the first Sierra Wireless made, as well as the last.  Unlike Sony, Nokia, Motorola, and others, they didn't have years and years to polish their design, work out kinks, respond to customer feedback, and so forth.  They boldly tried to make phones, did an incredible job for a first try, found the phone business to be filled with too many lawsuits and much drama, and quietly bowed out.  This means you aren't going to get a perfect phone, and support for this phone will eventually dry up altogether.  Be prepared for this.I don't think this (or any) phone was ever worth [...] mainly because of the limitations of Windows Mobile and a device that must be around the size of a cell phone.  It is certainly a bargain [...], with no contract, unlocked, brand new, and a fairly complete software package.  It's also not a huge loss if it gets stolen or broken.Kudos to Sierra Wireless for a great phone.  I only wish they had time to build more refined models.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Update 9/20/06First of all, this phone DOES work with the new SIM cards from Cingular.  I turned it on, placed a call, and received a call, all without problems.  I also got full bars in my living room, which even my brand new phone doesn't get.Unfortunately, I was unable to find an external antenna adapter.  According to one source, the connector was designed for a car kit adapter, sort of a quick-connect type thing.  I did buy the car kit, however, the antenna connector barely touches the contacts, so it's unlikely you'll get a solid, reliable connection that's suitable for data, although it probably works very well with voice.I stand behind by review (except for the spelling mistakes...oops)I went through three phones, all brand new with oodles of modern goodies and fancy bling, before I found one to replace the VOQ, and even then I was disappointed with the OS, which is Windows Mobile 5.  There is a lot more software out there for WM 2003se than WM 5.In fact, I haven't decided yet if my current phone is The One.If you can find the car kit (found mine on Ebay) it might be a worthy investment.  The VOQ slides right in, and the kit can either be installed in one car, or moved from vehicle to vehicle.  It comes with the parts to do both.  The only bad thing is the antenna, which is lame, but you can buy a Wilson antenna and hook it right up to the connector.The performance is very good.  I've played several games on the VOQ, and it performed flawlessly, with no slowdowns.  Other apps did slow down at times, but it never locked up.The mono headset is the best wired headset I've used.  The stereo headset is good for music, but not good at all for calls.I've been using a 2 gig SD card with no problems, although I've heard the max capacity is 512 mb.  There's something to be said for a standard size SD card, which is very rare with phones today.  No silly adapters for mini or micro SD cards, inexpensive, and easily removed without having to shut down, remove the battery and SIM, and all that nonsense which seems to be the standard with today's phones.The phone felt solid when I first got it, and after a few months of using it I can say it is very solid.If this had bluetooth, heck, if it just had a good external antenna adapter, I'd keep it.  I even considered digging around in there and soldering a good connector, but after having tried a bluetooth headset, I can't see going back to wired.I still haven't decided whether to put the VOQ on Ebay.  Should something happen to my current phone, which is too expensive to quickly replace and which Cingular refuses to insure, again because it's too expensive, I'd have a real hard time going back to a cheap normal phone.  I'm even having a hard time giving up my QWERTY keyboard.  Anyway, I'd hate to see this great phone sit around for nothing while the battery ages, so I'll probably send this up after the return period is over for my new phone.Did I mention this phone works with the new SIM cards from Cingular?

While this particular phone is not supported, just choose a Pocket PC phone (like the HP) and adapt the directions for the OS.Once it's running, the browser is great.  I like the fact that you can force it to display images larger than the screen (normally it will resize to fit, making maps unreadable).  You can use Google Local without too much fuss.  Great phone for the price.Only real downside to phone that I've found:  Secure Digital slot is not SDIO, so no Bluetooth (or WiFi) for you.", "Date": "November 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "An absolutely fantastic box set!!! Go Scrubs!!!", "Author": "Aaron McConnell \"Azza\"", "ReviewID": "R2512Q9PU7N87Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Scrubs season two came out on DVD where I live yesterday (Australia) and I have to say that the quality of this box set actually managaes to surpass that of season one. Once again, the special features are entertaining and informative without being too lengthy (perfect for my short attention span). The best short doco is one which features many of the on-set jokes between cast and crew - you really get the feeling that these people don't just turn up and make a sitcom for the money.While it's disappointing that there are only 22 episodes in season two, as opposed to the 24 from the first season, what is lost in quality is made up for in quantity. Once again we see the janitor (my absolute favourite character) do his best to make JD's life hell, while getting choked up when JD gives him a new mop (of all things!). Music also features heavily in these episodes, with the return of 'Ted's Band' seeing a fantastic rendition of the theme song from 'Charles in Charge'. Check out the extras to see these guys do their own special cover of the Scrubs theme song.Even the menus are exciting - containing the entire Scrubs theme song, which is seriously catchy (sings) ...but I know, I'm no Superman... (all right I'll stop now). In the episodes themselves, the picture is very clear and the sound is great too, and excellent transfer from the source material. Considering the terrible pattern in which these shows screened in Australia, it's nice to be able to watch them in order as intended. All in all, this is a fantastic set at a great price - where I'm from it's about half the cost of (for example) Simpsons and Frasier box sets. And because Scrubs is just one of those shows you can watch over and over again, it's well worth every cent.", "Date": "September 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not a bad phone, but...", "Author": "Jonathan M.

If you are in a restaurant or the street you probably won't hear it at all. If the phone is in the next room, you won't hear it ring. There is a vibrate mode, but it will only vibrate one time, and again you may miss it.2) The alarm clock mode will not work unless the phone is turned on. So you can't turn it off at bedtime and use it as an alarm clock.2) The keyboard is good and it is useful for instant messaging.3) The phone is solidly constructed.4) The phone has good reception and transmission in areas of weak signals.5) Being unlocked, you can use it with different SIM cards when traveling overseas.", "Date": "October 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone!", "Author": "C.

It comes with the OS already installed (Microsoft Mobile 2003). The VOQ Mail Pro software is really nice and better than Outlook.  The boot time is a little slow but that is the OS not the phone (its Microsoft Windows, come on ppl).This phone works great on the Cingular network.  I receive an excellent signal.  Much better than the Blackberry (on the T-Mobile network).  The usability with this phone to navigate back and forth through the features is great.  Again, better than the blackberry 6120.I will be buying more of these phones in the future if I can get access to them.  Sierra Wireless discontinued this phone which is too bad.  I reviewed many many smartphones and PDA's before making my choice with the Voq Pro phone. For the price ($150 US) this phone has met and exceeded in some areas all of my expectations.  I considered purchasing the following:- Treo 650- Samsung i730- iPAQ hw6500The only feature I wish this phone had was bluetooth for transferring files between my phone and laptop.", "Date": "November 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Smart phone for smart people", "Author": "Phily", "ReviewID": "R33ZWDRRQDAT3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just want to say, this is the phone which has everything I need. I don't use phone to take picture, and talking with bluetooth earphone seems very stupid for me..So this phone, without bluetooth and camera, just fine for me.For those people who complain about battery life, you can setup your GPRS as \"manually\" connect with Internet, so that the phone will not keep connecting with internet for checking email, then battery life is just as good as other phones. Typically, I use this phone everyday for talking about total 1 hour, and for listening music about 2 hours (walk on the way to work and on the way back home), before I go to bed to recharge it, it usually has 2 bars of battery left.I am using 2GB SD card and it works fine. SD card is the cheapest memory card nowadays. And who does not have one SD card? So you don't have to spend extra money for memory card. I saved a lot of music and picture on it. Some important files, I also copy them in the phone as I can check on the go.The best part of this phone is, it integrates a lot of softwares, makes it able to read Word, Excel, Powerpoint and PDF files with no problem, those softwares you must pay to have register code in any other smart phone. It also has a file manager, picture view software, and it can play pictures as slide show in full screen. I used Audiovox SMT5600 before, it even does not have a file manager.Furthermore, it can be used as a modem if you have dial-up internet available, so connecting with your laptop can let you go online at anywhere without expensive phone data plan. Or you can use dial-up directly on the phone, to use internet explore for checking your email on the phone. But be aware of that Cingular blocks data transfer if you don't use their internet sevice. So if you are using T-mobile, it will be no problem to use this phone's dial-up for online, sepcially at weekend and evening, you get free internet service because your call is free during these time.Like other smartphone, it can syncs with your computer for all your contacts and calender, and even playlist in Windows media player.If you go online to search, you can find a lot of games and home screen themes available for free. The only thing I want complain is, everytime I restart the phone, it loses the home screen themes which I personalized with my son's picture, and I have to copy them into the phone again.Over all, this is a wonderful phone for those people who understand how to use a smartphone.--------------------------------------------------Update on December 29, 2006Recently I installed an Asian Language Pack, so now the phone can show my music file's name in original language which comes with songs... Also, I installed a software called TMPMP which can let my phone play MP4 and 3GPP movies, so my phone now is really SUPER powerful. Of course this progarm also can play MP3 and wma, and acc files.", "Date": "December 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fantastic deal on a AWESOME phone", "Author": "von Mises", "ReviewID": "R33CI17HJH0BIV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lots of phone for the price.

I originally bought it because I needed a business phone that didn't have a camera-kind of a big deal in many office environments these days.Some of the complaints against this phone have more to do with how Windows Mobile / Pocket PCs work than with this phone in particular.  Example:  it does take a lot of menu hopping to jump around, but that's typical of any WM device.  Use the smart myVoq feature instead.If you leave \"receiving incoming beams\" on, you'll have to recharge twice a day as your phone constantly looks for infrared input that probably isn't there.  Turn it off and you'll find a much better battery life.  Heavy talk times might mean once a day recharging; I average once every other day.If it sometimes wakes up on its own, that's Windows Mobile for you.  If I remember correctly, that particular version of WM had to start up to handle scheduled events (it's the same for Pocket PCs from around the same period).  It's only up for a second, it won't kill you.The phone is on the largish side for a phone, but not for a Blackberry or Smartphone device.  If you want extra functionality expect extra bulk, that's all there is to it.  The way you're supposed to look at these things is to consider that now you don't have to carry phone + PDA, phone + laptop, etc.  Don't buy this phone if you wish your RAZR had a keyboard, the size will break your heart.It comes with more ringtones than your average phone, but if you don't like the offerings bring your own, it'll use MP3s among others.The fold-out keyboard is quite good, in fact out of all the thumb board styled keyboards I've used it's probably the one I personally find  I type the quickest and type with the fewest mistakes, which is probably due to the nice intuitive QWERTY layout.The screen is very bright and crisp, and along with the keypad is pretty functional even in the dark.  I wouldn't want to write my thesis on it, but if you just need to check a Word attachment from an email this phone is perfect.Compared to Palm there isn't as much software for Windows-based Smartphones available (at least of the free variety), but the Voq also has a Java client installed.  Works great with Opera mini.  Don't forget it'll also run some Pocket PC apps-I use Pocket PuTTY to SSH from the Voq and it works great (love that QWERTY keyboard!) with every site I've tried.All in all you really can't beat a new, unlocked Smartphone for this price.  It has its quirks, and it does look kind of big on your belt, but I really think it's an excellent product.", "Date": "June 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Ark", "ReviewID": "R3M23Z05SD1HOC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first smartphone, and let me say, I am really liking the functionality of it. I bought it mainly because I have been looking for a phone that I could use as an mp3 player as well, and for only $80, its a steal. I also love texting with the full QWERTY keyboard.I almost didn't buy this phone after reading some of the reviews. However, the 2 or 3 reasons I read that people didn't like it for, were in fact incorrect.1. Yes, the ringtones that come with it are virtually inaudible, but it does support mp3 ringtones. If you add an mp3 to your media library(from your sd card) it should be in the ringtone section. Or what I did, after you have installed activesync on your computer, just go to the folder that holds all the default ringtones, and upload your ringtones there. They are plenty loud, actually they are louder than my Razr V3 ringtones. No problem hearing them ever.2. Size. Everyone says this thing is massive. Its pretty big, yeah. But it is no bigger than a Sidekick 3. In fact, I bought a Sidekick pouch for it, and it fits perfectly, so if sidekicks are too big for you, then dont get it, otherwise, size isn't a big deal.Only kind of bad thing I can say about this phone is its battery life, and it's not that bad. I listen to music about 4 hours at work, and at the end of my  9 hour shift, It's usually around 55% left. Whats weird is when it finishes charging, and you leave it plugged in, it still drains the battery.

This is one of the few shows in TV history, quite like the Simpsons I suppose, that is so funny you keep expecting to wake up in your bed laughing, realise that a show this good does NOT, in fact exist, and that your world is all the poorer for it! Thankfully that's not the case tho...Season 2 continues to develop the characters of JD, Turk, Elliot, Carla and the inimatble Dr Cox in a similarly hilarious (and sometimes poignant) fashion as season 1. All the other supporting characters we know and love are back too, and with lots of celebs jumping on board for an episode or two (Scrubs has fast become as fashionable a cameo vehicle as The Simpsons or the late great Friends)Our heroes are now a lot more experienced and versed in the ways of hospital life, but year 2 brings new challenges. And of course Dr. Cox cares not how experienced they have become, he needs no encouragment whatsoever to dress them down as often as possible!Season 2 picks up after the bombshell that Dr Cox's ex-wife, Jordan, laid on them all at the end of Season one - Cox's love for Carla (and Turk knowingly witholding that information from Carla!), Elliot's love for JD, JD's brief fling with Jordan herself and other revelations are all waiting in the wings to be continued as Season 2 commences...The Season 2 episodes list is as follows:25: My Overkill26: My Nightingale27: My Case Study28: My Big Mouth29: My New Coat30: My Big Brother31: My First Step32: My Fruit Cups33: My Lucky Day34: My Monster35: My Sex Buddy36: My New Old Friend37: My Philosophy38: My Brother, My Keeper39: His Story40: My Karma41: My Own Private Practice Guy42: My T.C.W.43: My Kingdom44: My Interpretation45: My Drama Queen46: My Dream JobSo there you have it.

I said in my review for the first season that Scrubs was the first truly classic 21st century sitcom, and if you didn't believe me when you saw the first season, you'll definitely be changing your tune when you watch the second season.  This season isn't as immediate as the first one, mainly because the jokes are so intelligent, humorous, and sometimes subtle that it's easy to overlook them the first viewing.  Emotionally, however, this season has a stronger, more mature core, and that's apparent on the first viewing, and the writing has grown as well.The jokes are definitely more memorable.  Everywhere I go now I practically make a reference to jokes on that show (especially when Dr. Cox is trying to come up with another girl's name to call J.D.).  I want to meet the guy who came up with the line \"...she sent him to surgery where you guys helped him kick that nasty oxygen habit he had once and for all!\" because the wit in that one line is just to die for.  The visual gags, such as the massive Rerun dance fantasy and J.D. getting a shower of spit from Dr. Cox, leave a mark of originality that most shows lack.The more dramatic parts coalesce even more than last season.  Even episodes that start out quirky end up making the most impact such as \"His Story\" and \"My T.C.W.\"  \"My Philosophy\" is probably the most emotional episode of the season, made even more so by J.D.'s subdued reaction to a patient's death at the end.  Each character has evolved and made even more human.  Dr. Cox is the most transformed; he still has the bite and sarcasm that makes him Dr. Cox, but he showed more of the cracks underneath the surface this time around, allowing for an understanding of why he is the way he is.  J.D. also has grown; at times his mistakes are hurtful and not as humorous, in short he has become human and not just a humorous focal point.Enough of me talking about this.

Dr. Coz, the chief of staff constantly gives him advice but most of what he says is trying to hurt him rather than help him. Dr. Cox affectionately gives him the name newbie. Turk's girlfriend Nurse Carla watches out for JD and adds a lot of comic relief. Then there's Dr. Kelso who runs the hospital. Everyone pretty much fears him.

It has tons of great features and for such a low price, so who wouldn't want to try it out? This a fully-enabled smartphone, with all the applications and such of any other windows smartphone, such as Windows Media Player mobile (I listen to MP3s all the time) and Internet Explorer (if you look it up, you can get internet for only 6 bucks a month!). The included \"myVoq\" program makes searching for contacts and other items a breeze (it works much like spotlight on the mac). The keyboard is great for texting, email, and, for forgetful ones like me, notes and the pocket outlook calendar. The included SD card slot allows me to take my movies, music, photos, and documents on the go, which can all be accessed by various programs on the Voq's beautiful backlit color screen. This smartphone holds a charge for about 2-4 days for me, depending upon usage - if I just use it for a few calls and the calendar for a few days, it can last for about 3-4 days. But as soon as you start listening to music or, especially, using the internet, that battery starts going down, but you still usually get at least 2 days out of it. The phone gets great reception - not the best, but close. Voices come in and go out loud and clear. This smartphone is comfortable to hold in one's hand and isn't as large or heavy as many reviews might have you believe - it is still large though.Things of note:The contacts feature is crazy awesome! You can input all sorts of info, including a 3rd email, address, etc, anniversaries, birthdates, and even the names of people's kids! And on top of that, there's a feature to add extra \"notes\" so if there isn't a field you see that you want to write something about someone down in, you can just utilize that. Also, the calendar feature is great, acting much like Outlook on the PC with reminders and all that. Also, build quality is excellent - after a year, the thing still feels practically new, despite the fact that I carry it around in my pocket all day.The two first reactions I always get from this phone are: Man, that thing is huge! and That keyboard is so freaking cool!

It's odd fantasy sequences are quite unique and the no-studio audience format is quite interesting. There is no laugh track, which leaves you laughing on your own.And, watching Season two, there were plenty of chances to laugh.As J.D. (Zach Braff), Elliot (Sarah Chalke) and Turk (Donald Faison) enter their second year at Sacred Heart Hospital, they are certainly bound to take a step up. Instead of being interns, they are now residents, left with more decisions and more responsibility.John (J.D.) Dorian is the center of the show and the episodes, for the most part, are written from his point of view. He provides the narration for almost all the episodes and the fantasies are usually spawned from his brain. In season two, he wrestles with his feelings for fellow resident Elliot Reed, battles with chief resident Perry Cox (John C. McGinley), sees his best friend Turk get engaged and has numerous romantic entanglements. I will say, that JD gets tons of beautiful women. In this season alone, guest stars that went on dates with him include Amy Smart as the Tasty Coma Wife (A great episode) and Sarah Lancaster as the gift shop girl. But truly, JD is lonely, especially in comparison to his best friend Turk. One highlight of the season is a visit from J.D.'s brother (Tom Cavanaugh). The pair actually look a  lot alike.Turk, in season one, met nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes) and in season two, the pair become engaged. It is revealed in commentaries by the show's creator, that Turk and Carla are a couple they plan on keeping together for the length of the show and they have to work out many problems to get to that point. In season two, Turk's engagement ring gets swallowed by a young patient, Carla's mother dies, Turk's brother (guest star D.L.  Hughley) creates havoc on their relationship and they have the typical arguments that come with being newly engaged.Elliot has problems of her own, ranging from battling her feelings for JD to exploring other relationships, mainly with nurse Paul (guest star Rick Schroder). She finds herself cut off from her father's money, forced to live in a truck for a while and then crashes on Turk and JD's couch. She is a nervous wreck for the most part, but at the same time she is a competent doctor, who just needs to get her personal life in check.As Dr. Cox, McGinley is superb.  His long rants and diatribes are hilarious to listen to and the way he chooses a different girls' name to call JD every time he speaks, is pretty funny as well. In this season, he reunites with his ex-wife Jordan (Christa Miller), who is pregnant and eventually delivers, his baby. A highlight of the season was the episode where Cox narrates, taking over from JD's usual role. It is insightful to hear from someone else every now and then. He also has a relationship with a pharmaceutical rep, played to perfection by Heather Locklear.Ken Jenkins adds a bit of meanness as Chief of Staff Bob Kelso. He constantly berates Dr. Cox and is always looking for a resident or intern to pick on, often settling on Elliot or JD. His pompous attitude creates a lot of friction between himself and other members of the staff, but that leads to a lot of great comedic moments.Neil Flynn is added to the regular cast as the nameless janitor. According to commentaries with the show's creator, Flynn ad libs most of his lines. His incessant picking on JD is quite funny and really, I find the janitor to be the funniest character on the show. I love it when he pretends to be a doctor, or just finds inane ways to pick on JD.As far as extras go, this set is great. There are a number of commentary tracks with creator Bill Lawrence and various cast members. There are a number of featurrettes, one dealing with guest stars, another with music. There are deleted scenes and outtakes and a one-on-one interview with John C. McGinley, which is quite interesting. I found the commentaries to be quite informative and a very welcome addition to the set.All in all, a great set of a show that has yet to be truly appreciated by the networks and even by some television fans.

The set hits the ground rolling with all the same wit, humor, and directorial prowess as the entire crew continues to push the bounds of what can be done for this relatively small series on a budget.The truly observant will note that some of the more quirky aspects of the first season have been eliminated or toned down - notably the sound effects, which are used much more sparingly. The change works, though, as the basic feel of the series remains the same while not having to rely on that comedic crutch.In the second season, our frightened new doctors, fresh out of college in the first season, manage to find their feet a bit. The show takes the opportunity to explore their feelings and relationships while they gain their confidence, but takes care to affirm that they're still only learning.The focus of season two is still the mostly-lovable but self-centered and oblivious JD, but there is plenty of room for growth of the other characters. Almost all of the focus characters are rounded out and grow, right down to the JD's janitorial nemesis.As for the DVD release, special features abound. What's more, though, is that they are features that are actually worth watching. The show's cast and creators open a window to what goes into creating a sitcom, from the difficulties of shooting in a real hospital to casting, scriptwriting, and dealing with unlikely success. The episode commentaries are also a wonderful glimpse at the level of involvement and dedication that goes into making a hit series. Recorded years after the making of the episodes in question, it is amazing what little details those involved manage to recall.As fast-paced comedy goes, it is difficult to beat Scrubs.

As the season opens, J.D., Turk, and Elliot have just finished their internships and are entering their medical residency years. Also, Jordan, Cox's caustic ex-wife, has set the cat among the pigeons by outing her ex's crush on Carla (and Turk's knowledge of it), Elliot's crush on JD, Kelso's manipulation of Cox, and the fact that she has slept with JD - and it was \"go-ood\". The gang can barely look at one another - Turk and JD are forced to bunk together, Carla is huffing, Elliot is hiding under tables to avoid JD, and Cox is blowing steam through his nose everytime he sees Kelso.In \"My Nightingale\", Dr. Cox tries to convince Jordan that they should reunite, and that he is not the same self-sabotaging person he was when they were married. However, Jordan leaves after she hears what is supposed to be an introductory speech praising evil Dr. Kelso that Cox turns into a roast. Fortunately for Cox, though, the audience misconstrues his remarks as sarcastic and humorous. The funniest part of this episode is the appearance of hospital lawyer Ted (Sam Lloyd) and his real-life acapella group spending an entire night-shift singing TV theme tunes, including upbeat renditions of The Six Million Dollar Man and Charles in Charge. You see, TV theme songs are their specialty. From that point forward, \"The Blanks\" are frequently featured in the show.\"My Fruit Cups\" is a realistic episode about financial pressures that medical students face as Turk and J.D. periodically fill their trunk with hospital food - specifically fruit cups and pudding - to help make ends meet. The janitor is making J.D. sweat over this issue since he tells him he is investigating a number of thefts at the hospital. Only later do we find out he is investigating the theft of drugs, not food. Elliot, who up to now has had no financial problems since her father has been footing the entire bill, finds out that his generosity comes with a price - Her dad believes he has purchased the right to tell her what medical specialty to enter into. Meanwhile, Jordan has returned, obviously pregnant, but who is the father?The J.D/Elliot relationship resurfaces when Elliot begins to feel alone and financially pressured for the first time in her life after her dad withdraws his support. On top of everything, she is being sued by a patient whom she wrongly diagnosed as having eight months to live when he winds up living longer than that. So she begins to have sex with JD in order to relax, until at some point they become sex buddies. JD begins to really like this no-strings set up until  Turk tells him that at some point Elliot is going to search for sex sometime when her emotions are normalized and then J.D. will be back where he was with her last year. This leaves JD seeking a way to break up with her again.\"His Story\" is probably my favorite episode of the season because it features the snarky Dr. Cox and has just the right amount of comedy and drama. First off, J.D. says for the first time, that he has no story to tell and Dr. Cox takes over the narration for a change. Thus the episode reveals a lot about the character of Dr Cox, with scenes such as his therapist telling him he'll end up all alone, the party that nobody turns up to with all that money spent on pizza, and Cox's reaction to JD leaving him. Combine this with such insanely random humor as Pancake Man and Johnny the tackling Alzheimer's patient and you have a nearly perfect episode.Later in the season, J.D. finds himself attracted to Jamie, the T.C.W. (tasty coma wife), a woman whose husband has been in a coma for the past two years. He fights the attraction, but later the husband dies, and J.D. begins a relationship with her. Unfortunately, she gets bored easily, and J.D. finds out Jamie is a \"drama queen\" - in order to keep her interested he has to stir up some kind of trouble. However, when he runs out of ideas and tells her that he and Elliot are getting back together he realizes things have gone too far.In summary, if you enjoyed Season One of Scrubs, you'll enjoy Season Two just as much or more.", "Date": "December 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Another Hilarious Year of Malpractice", "Author": "Andrew \"Radaar\"", "ReviewID": "R36BD8MKGH5GDJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the second season of Scrubs, one of the few genuinely funny comedies left on TV, life at Sacred Heart Hospital doesn't get any easier for Drs. John \"J.D.\" Dorian (Zach Braff), Chris Turk (Donald Faison), and Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke), who are now residents.  In fact, things only seem to get worse for them, but for us, that only provides for more laughs.In the first season, much of the focus was on how demanding the life at a hospital could be.  Evil bosses like Dr. Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins), mentally unbalanced mentors like Dr. Perry Cox (John C. McGinley), and a psychotic Janitor (Neil Flynn, now a regular) made life at the hospital hell.  While there were a few bright spots, like Nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes), who became fast friends with J.D. and became Turk's girlfriend, there were many hardships to overcome.  Now, while things still are difficult at the hospital, the newbies have got their routines down.  This year, the characters' personal lives serve as the focus.One of the biggest story arcs involves Dr. Cox's ex-wife Jordan Sullivan (Christa Miller), who is pregnant with another man's baby.  Meanwhile, Turk decides to propose to Carla (in a very hilarious way), while Elliot and J.D. still find dating a challenge.  Elliot falls head over heals for a very nice, very attractive guy, but when she learns that he's a nurse at the hospital, she has a hard time accepting the fact.  Meanwhile, J.D. has a constant stream of bizarre relationships from Lisa the Gift Shop Girl (Sarah Lancaster) to Jamie Moyer (Amy Smart), AKA Tasty Coma Wife (or T.C.W. for short), a woman who's husband is slowly dying while in a coma.Sound effects and fantasy sequences are still a major contributor to the comedy this year, but not as much as last year.  Still, this show has some of the best cutaway sequences this side of Family Guy.  Some of my favorites include J.D. and a German patient dancing to the song 99 Red Balloons, while another has Elliot and Jamie doing the \"Rerun Dance\", complete with matching outfits (there is a very interesting story about that in the extras section).  Furthermore, in one of the most original openings in sitcom history, singer/songwriter Colin Hay performs his song Overkill and follows J.D. around the hospital, showing up in bizarre places, including the morgue.  Another great thing that I started noticing this year is the very subtle placement of things from earlier episodes in subsequent ones.  While this show came before Arrested Development, AD is what made inside jokes like that famous, so I'm going to compare these references to those of AD.  For instance, in one episode, J.D. remembers how he bought a ventriloquist dummy to impress women, then in a later episode, we see it in his room.Some of my favorite jokes are the ones involving the Janitor, who was allowed to interact with characters besides J.D. this year.  He is still tormenting J.D. for no reason, but this year, he begins to badger Turk and Dr. Cox.  Originally, there was going to be a twist where he was only a figment of J.D.'s imagination, but when they realized that they were going to stay on the air for a while, they started writing scenes for the Janitor with other characters.  Neil Flynn is a comic genius; he delivers his lines so well, and is great at improv.  In the alternate takes extra, some of the greatest stuff are the things that he didn't say.Still, one of the greatest things about this season was the episode \"His Story\".  Nearly every episode begins with the word My, because each episode is narrated by J.D.  In \"His Story\", the episode is told from Dr. Cox's point of view and we begin to see what makes him tick.  This was a very new and fresh episode, and in every season since, there has been an episode told from another character's perspective (so far we've gotten Turk and Elliot, and Carla is coming up next, but I can't wait for the Janitor to get one, but it probably won't happen).The list of guest stars this year may even be better than last year.  Many actors from Spin City showed up this year (Bill Lawrence also works on that show), including Heather Locklear, Alan Ruck, and Richard Kind.  Furthermore, Dick Van Dyke, Jay Leno, Jay Mohr, Ryan Reynolds, David Copperfield, and Fred Berry.  Furthermore, the returning characters of Dr. Doug Murphy (Johnny Kastl), Dr. Todd Quinlan (Robert Maschio), Nurse Laverne Roberts (Aloma Wright), and Ted Buckland (Sam Lloyd) had many great appearances.The music on the show is almost a character itself.  Often, the background music is used to help tell the story or transition between drama and comedy.  There are very few shows that I can think of that music plays such a pivotal role (Veronica Mars is one of them, and even that show doesn't use music as such an essential thing).Finally, the extras on this set are amazing.  Television DVD sets tend to get the short end of the stick when it comes to extras.  Sometimes, they'll have one or two good commentaries (with a bunch of other lousy ones) and some featurettes that are very hit or miss.  On the Scrubs sets, all of the featurettes are entertaining.  I haven't listened to any commentary tracks yet, but, judging by the quality of the other features, I am sure that they are also very well done.In short, this is another great Scrubs set.  I would reccomend it to everyone with the one caveat (to some people at least) that some of the sex scenes are a little racy.  The show is shot at an abandoned hospital, which many of the network execs find to be either too far or too creepy to visit on a day-to-day basis.  Therefore, the crew is able to get away with stuff that most shows couldn't, so there are a few very steamy scenes, and if this is a problem for you, beware.  Otherwise, enjoy another great season of TV.", "Date": "November 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not entirely unlike...a ninja", "Author": "Brett Corkins", "ReviewID": "RAYZCMI3T3A0O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ever since I first saw Scrubs I've been smitten with it's distinct brand of comedy. Each character is different than the others and has their own story, not to mention they're each relatable in their own twisted way. Although the series still focuses solely on JD, there are points in every episode which explore the inner thoughts of each person. Even the massively misunderstood Dr. Cox gets his turn in the spotlight when he takes the place of JD and we really get to know the real him. There could be no better way to follow up a season like the first than with one like this. Season 2 continues from last season's ending fight where Cox's ex-wife tells every secret each person had.Each person seems much more human this time around, not that they didn't in the first season. I was happy to see that we got to learn more about Elliot. She was the one person that you really never got to know, and as expected she's a full load. You could always tell she was overly stressed but now you learn why. But don't think that just because you learn more about the characters that you won't be laughing a lot along the way. Each episode is chalk full of laughs and an equal amount of sadness. I will admit though that the dramatic scenes aren't as dramatic as they were in the first season. Nothing has really changed from season 1 to season 2 and I like that. JD and Turk are still best friend, Carla and Turk are still totally in love, JD and Elliot are still trying to figure out how they feel about each other, Cox and JD still have a love/hate relationship, and JD and the janitor are still creating waves.With a slew of great guest appearances, a great basic plot line, and terrific acting on everyone's part, there's no reason not to love this show. Each episode tends to deal with a different human emotion and does it's job with flying colors. There's no show on TV right now that makes its characters seem more real, even though they're completely fictional, and that is as important as anything.", "Date": "November 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "I AM SHAKING WITH ANTICIPATION!", "Author": "Rusty Shackleford \"Randy\"", "ReviewID": "R2A6LV8UGPI1GY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can be said about the best sitcom on television that hasn't already been mentioned?

If you're unfamiliar with the series then you are in for a real treat. Basically SCRUBS is a sitcom that is tailor made for 20-somethings but somehow transcends the limitations of most other shows and finds an audience in most all demographics. The show does this by combining drama with quick witted humor and probably the most slap-stick in a TV series since The Dick VanDyke Show (speaking of which, Dick VanDyke guest stars in the episode My Brother, My Keeper). SCRUBS is honest and farcical all at the same time. The show can make you laugh out loud at one of the many \"day-dream\" sequences then have tears welling up in your eyes not 10 seconds later. It's the most unique and fulfilling half-hour on TV today. And now it's on DVD so you don't have to sit through those lame commercials!Whereas Season 1 focused more on \"the job\" of being a doctor/surgeon/nurse and how these 20-something interns relied on each other to get through the day, season 2 focuses a little bit more on the personal lives of the staff at Los Angeles' fictitious Sacred Heart Hospital. But make no mistake, just because focus shifts towards personal lives doesn't mean the cast ever strays too far from the hospital and the pressures that \"the job\" still brings (see the episode My Monster). As far as personal lives go Season 2 sees some old flames from Season 1 rekindle then quickly dwindle: J.D. and Elliot (not a gay thing, Elliot is a woman played by the sexy Sarah Chalke). While other relationships become more serious: Dr. Cox & his ex-wife and surgeon Turk & Nurse Carla. Also guest-starring in several outstanding story arcs are Heather Locklear (as a sluty pharmaceutical rep) and former NYPD Blue & Silver Spoons star Ricky \"Call me Rick\" Schroder (as a male nurse or \"murse\").And if you're a fan of Bonus Features then this set will not disappoint. Even more features than the previous volume, season 2 has featurettes that delve into what really makes the show tick: the day-dream sequences, the character interaction, and of course the music. Series creator/writer Bill Lawrence also delivers 7 outstanding commentaries with the main cast on 7 great episodes. The Season 1 commentaries where a bit stale and had a lot of silence, but Bill & the cast seem to be trying on these and actually deliver commentaries worth listening to. And there's also the requisite deleted scenes and bloopers features.

Added for season two is stunt casting, where celebrity appearances and cameo appearances are shown and commented upon. Imagination Gone Wild where the actors and crew commentate on the fantasy scenes and we also get to see most of these fantasies together in the one clip while they do this is also sensational.  Other great new features include Secrets and Lies where crew and actors make fun of each other, JD's Mojo where Zach Braff and others analyse JD's sex life as well as Johnny Keeps Talking where Johnny C. (Dr. Cox) tells us all about getting the part, how he turned it down three times, how he developed the character and his first impression of the other actors.  Musical stylings highlights the importance of music selection for Scrubs success and either in this or one of the other extras Zach Braff explains how he discovered Lazlo Bane's song Superman and convinced the creators to use it as the Scrubs theme song.The only thing I didn't like about the season two DVDs was that with a lot of the audio commentaries the director seems to have forgotten to turn his microphone on so you have to turn up the volume really loud to hear what he is saying, meanwhile whichever actor is co-commentating who does has their microphone on is really loud.  This is the case on the Australian version anyway, which means you can't really watch these commentaries late at night but need to find a time when your neighbours aren't home.Of course you also get all 22 hilarious episodes of season two which alone make this a much own DVD but the extras as well show other TV programs what can be achieved when you actually care about your fans and want to give them value for money.

The characters are nicely established, each with their own quirks and foibles, yet are still fresh and exciting, while the setting and the characters' predicaments are still different and interesting with enough scope for outlandish antics. Later seasons got a little tired as the characters/jokes didn't seem to have that many new places to go. For example, how long can it be funny for Dr. Cox to call JD Joanna? Originally that was funny and you were just dying to see what name he'd come up with next and what novel way he'd think of to emasculate JD - now... well, we've pretty much heard it all before.This season is so funny though, with sharp dialogue, still fresh characters and situations, and off-the-wall humor to throw you into fits of laughter when you least expect it. Okay, you might say that when watching a TV comedy you do 'expect' to laugh, but do you? Do you really 'expect' to? I don't. Not with most of the garbage that's thrown at us these days. So to find something that legitimately makes me laugh is a very pleasant surprise and a wonderful treat.My favorite characters are JD, Dr. Cox (of course), the janitor, and a much underrated bit-part player - Ted, the abused lawyer. All the other characters have their moments, but you'll find the best humor comes from the interplay of these guys.If you want an idea of what it's like - think of the friendships of Friends mixed with the squabbling of Frazier (with Niles) set in a hospital run in a Faulty Towers fashion, with Terry Gilliam's stop-motion animation replaced by the live action of the characters' daydreaming. Yep, that's Scrubs for you!If you've never seen Scrubs, it might take a little getting used to - such an odd group of dysfunctional individuals with such 'life and death' responsibilities - but once you get the hang of what's going on, I defy you to not laugh. And every so often they do throw you a curve ball and add a little sensitivity - the odd patient does die, and not in a funny way. But those serious asides add to its allure.Scrubs is a modern day classic - cleverly written, with endearing characters, and sharp wit. Go on, treat yourself!", "Date": "October 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Scrubbing bad TV from my memory...", "Author": "Daniel A Moir", "ReviewID": "R1YZCW11YOXE56", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had all but given up on TV as a viable form of entertainment when a couple of years ago (it seems) my wife and I stumbled upon a premier of a show called Father of the Pride, and another zany show called Scrubs immediately afterward. We fell in love with both shows, but only one would survive to a sophomore season.  The advantage Scrubs had is multi-fold; it featured edgy writing, a great cast, colorful and loveable characters and physical comedy that is rarely seen in sitcoms. It also did away with the annoying canned laughter that most sitcoms incorporate almost as instructions for the audience on when to laugh. The biggest advantage Scrubs had over Father of the Pride was it's low budget, but would you believe that the show's low budget would hardly be noticed? There are many moments that his show pulls off high quality stunts, and special effects that are quite nice! The best part of it is that the show is hilarious, and completely off the wall.  I like how the main character of the show (JD) has countless memorable day dreams which are often as random and completely absurd as what most of us imagine, but never vocalize. This presents a wonderfully human quality to this otherwise over the top show, and it's this element, which puts it over the top as well, which adds to the fun.  Though the show doesn't quite reach the high quality standards set by the likes of Third Rock from the Sun Scrubs does come pretty close. What holds it back is that unlike 3rd Rock this show is not family friendly and features a great deal of sexual content which may not be appropriate for younger viewers. There isn't anything that would make it R rated, but the show certainly does push the limits of what is acceptable on Prime Time TV. Thankfully the show compensates by keeping the vulgar language to a minimum. All in all I highly recommend this show to comedy fans, but with the warning to parents that some of the subject matter may be inappropriate for younger audiences, funny show that it is, I certainly would not let any young children watch it.  Not every show is airing in wide screen, it's a real shame because this show would benefit from it greatly as the picture is crystal clear, and extremely sharp, but is limited to a 1:33:1 aspect ratio, which means watching it in an awkward stretched ratio, or with reversed letter boxes for wide screen TVs. It would have been nice to have this show filmed with Wide screen in mind, as the clear picture does reveal HD may have been. Usually HD and Wide screen go hand in hand, but not in this case. I realize that DVDs are limited to 480p, but you can definitely tell if a show was shot for HD or not. The transfer is really clean here, I mean REALLY clean, its just a shame that it wasn't shot in 16x9. If they're using a DV cameras like I think they are a simple press of a button could solve that problem.  The sound for the first couple episodes were great but for some reason the volume dropped suddenly in the middle of disk one and never really came back up until I adjusted the volume. However, this is a show with few crashes, explosions, or anything that would require Dolby Digital 5.1, so the fact that it is included is a nice bonus. The sound is decent, but not exceptional.  It's not often I find a TV show that can make me laugh, but this is definitely over the top enough to pull it off, but not with the same element of class as, say 3rd Rock. Its not something you can watch with the whole family, because of its content, but it's still a highly enjoyable experience for the adults in the home, and has an excellent collection of special features which are worth watching as well.", "Date": "January 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Waste of money", "Author": "OptimusPrime", "ReviewID": "RAO0AJMAMIGW0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am writing this review after using this phone for almost 4 months.Advantages:1] Price is lesssss.Disadvantages:1] Bulky2] No great looks3] Battery - big issue4] Although it have bulky and tough looks, its not that tough to handle shocks.

Gyurisin \"good friend, damn fool\"", "ReviewID": "R3LAFGJ6WETLKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have discovered that television has dramatically changed over the years.  It isn't about original programming any more; it is simply about how many advertisements you can jam into a half-hour time slot.  It has become depressing.  Where has all the original programs like Alf, Slimer and the Real Ghostbusters, and Golden Girls gone?  Instead, we are forced to watch prefabricated sit-coms that involve no reality (aka no money, fabulous house, amazing bodies) and are full of more commercialism than you can wag a stick at.  So, I have done my part to stop this \"forced\" television by cutting my cable all together.  I told the company that deals with our neighborhood that they were no better than the \"big tobacco companies\" and that I needed to stop \"cold turkey\" if I were to release from their cold dark hand.  So, with a huge gasp of air, I did.  Now, when I need my television fix, I buy a television series or rent one and enjoy the laughter without commercialism.  It is the only way to watch television anymore.  With all of this said, I finally had a chance to catch up on one of the most original television programs out there right now, Scrubs.  Its amazing blend of imagination, slapstick intelligent humor, and quirky characters keep the show fresh, appealing, and highly entertaining throughout its second season.Scrubs is not your typical show.  While it is a purely fictional program, I find that it deals with some of the most \"real\" problems facing us today.  What makes this show amazing is that it combines the realities of life with hysterical flashbacks and mind-challenging music.  The show is helmed by one of the greatest, and most comical, cast in television.  Zach Braff, amazing in Garden State, proves that he can play the \"every man\" better than anyone else in television.  His emotion, humor, and situations can somehow relate to true experiences in life, ones that we have all been through and laughed at afterwards.  His best pal Turk, who is struggling with the leaving bachelor lifestyle to marry his hospital girlfriend Carla, flanks him.  Together they have both imaginative adventures and dramatic encounters.  The \"third-wheel\" is Elliot, who cannot seem to pull herself out of a constant barrage of ruts, but always has her friends next to her.  These three are surrounded by some of the funniest, and human, doctors on television.  There is \"headmaster\" Bob Kelso and the hysterically funny John C. McGinley playing Braff's sarcastic mentor, Dr. Perry Cox.  With so much talent in a singular show, it is saddening to know that its peers have not awarded this show anything.  Studios would rather boast about the newest episode of Friends than reward a program that actually thinks about its comedy!I think what makes this program spectacular is how well the development team is able to combine both a comical, yet dramatic, element to each episode.  Not only do we laugh at these characters, but we also feel for them.  I do believe this is crucial in establishing a successful television show.  Audiences need to feel as if the characters are human, that they are (and can) go through experiences just like everyone else.  That is exactly what the team creating Scrubs has done.  What is great about the show is that they take these very small instances in our lives, blow them up, and surround them with humor, emotion, and quite a bit of great music.  Oh, the music.  That is definitely an element that sets this series apart from everything else cluttering our television sets.  The BEST Scrubs episode has to be the one where Colin Hay opens with his classic \"Men at Work\" song as he follows Braff throughout his day.  This will remain in your mind as a new television classic long after this series is dead.  Also, just the way the producers somehow pick some of the most beautiful songs to transition from comedy to drama in an instant, it is nearly like a third character.  The music is huge in Scrubs and I do not think it would be as successful without it.Scrubs also works because of the people involved with the show.  Everyone from Braff, to McGinley, to even the infamous Jan Itor (HA!) contribute 100% for each episode.  Each time I watch them interact together they make me laugh, they make me smile, and actually appreciate the creativity on television.  They are a smart group of actors that actually embrace comedy.  It is obvious that it is not forced, that they are not struggling with their characters, or seeking approval by any audience.  Scrubs is a show that you will either hate, or love.  It took me a couple of episodes to get fully developed into the show, but now, I cannot wait to witness J.D. fall into one of his mind \"escapes\" and take me into a very silly world remenicient of Monty Python or Seinfeld or even Family Guy.Overall, this second season is a phenomenal jump for this series.  There are some great twists, some amazing turns, while all the time keeping what we love about each of our characters in tact.  We see stronger relationships form while continuing that ER like emotion.  I cannot wait to watch the third season and revisit these old friends that make me smile each time I turn them on!  Scrubs is the perfect example of what television is like when you correctly combine intelligence, originality, and powerful actors!

Everyone isn't getting along after Dr. Cox's ex-wife started trouble between them all. Eventually they work things out of course. Then later on Dr. Cox's wife shows up pregnant and is lieing about it being someone elses. He then has to choose between her or Heather Locklier. Tough choice since both are hot lol. Also everyone starts making fun of the fact that Elliot is dating  a male nurse played by Rick Schroder. While Turk has to figure out how to ask Carla to marry him. I don't remember much about J.D this season, other than he has another short fling with Elliot.  As always the acting is brilliant with everyone having their moments when they are either funny and whacky or giving heart-felt performances. John C. McGinley probably should've won a 100 awards already as Dr. Cox but I don't think he was even nominated. He'll probably even have less of a chance now. I mean now Hugh Laurie is getting rave reviews as....a sarcastic Doctor that is a mentor to a lot of other doctors. Sound familiar ? Hugh Laurie is great but I can't help but think his character is just a little bit of a Dr. Cox rip-off. Zach Braff is brilliant too but I can't see why he gets nominated when McGinley constantly gets ignored. I mean to me, Zach Braff is just his side-kick and that McGinley is the main star. At least it seems  that way every time they are on screen together. Neil Flynn also steals the show each season as the janitor who has it out for J.D for absolutely no reason at all. Anyway this season is a little more whacky with less drama but it's still not a bad season at all.
