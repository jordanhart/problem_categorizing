It has all the technology that one needs making the internet and social media available but not the primary use of the phone.  This is an excellent phone for making calls and texting.  It has a variety of ring tones and wallpapers and font sizes that can actually be seen!  And also of note - it displays the clock in an easy to ready at a glance format.  Love it and loved the service I got from seller... ordered Sat PM - on my doorstep by noon Mon with only standard shipping!", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$166.00", "Features": "Includes exclusive J&R; 30-Day USA Warranty\nServices may vary ny location or by your GSM service carrier.\nMay not include English manual.
