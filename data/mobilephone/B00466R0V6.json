I told these people i wanted my money back they still ship the phone the, they recalled the phone in mid transit an sent me an email, mind you with such a matter i believe phone calls would be best but that's just my opinion,telling me that they will refund my money within 48hours to my knowledge 48 means within two days i received this email on the 7th of march 2011 it is now the 10th of march 2011 and up to now no one has contact me as to where my money is and when i will be getting it back this is my first time having dealings with this company (the OEM shop) and it has been the worst experienced yet i have googled trying to find other ways in terms of a phone number to contact this business to speak to a manager or someone in charge to no avail but what did come up on my Google search is posts and reviews of people who this company (the OEM shop) has done something similar to.To end off i would have to say people amazon is great because i have ordered stuff on the same day i ordered from the OEM shop and after and guess what i have already gotten my items but i have to say that the OEM shop will not be getting any more business from me other customers be aware you don't want to end up with the same problem i had.With that said i think amazon should have as a policy that persons or business who sell on Amazon need to put up more than an email address as contact info for those of us that end up having disputes like this because if you don't call (which you cant because there is no number) or email the OEM shop they wont contact you and tell you what is happen they need to realize people have to work hard for their money and don't wish to see it go down the drain for nothing again, Amazon is wonderful but the OEM shop needs to pull up their socks this is not a nice thing to be doing !!!!!!!!!", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Publicidad enga\u00f1osa", "Author": "Delcy", "ReviewID": "R2TAYT2GHCVGE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "compre el Blackberry ya que en su publicidad dice claramente que es liberado para cualquier empresa GSM de cualquier lugar del mundo, estoy en Caracas Venezuela y el celular esta bloqueado debo pagar aqui para liberarlo", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Horrible seller service", "Author": "Flora", "ReviewID": "R335ILJ8YSC83K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I paid for 1 day shipment.

Blackberry 9530 Storm Unlocked For Any GSM Carrier Worldwide! if you don't want your money stollen from you as i am losing $156.75 within six months, then never deal with the OEM shop through Amazon, the biggest regret of my life was to buy BLACKBERRY 9530 STORM UNLOCKED FOR  ANY GSM CARRIER WORLDWIDE, this product is not true, it is fake. I bought this item to use oversea in May, 2011, i travelled out and the product never worked, it goes off and your call drops immediately you pick it up, you can't hear anyone talking to you on it. I had to buy a new phone over there to use and on returning i tried to contact Amazon for the faulty product sold through their site and i was told to contact the seller, and the seller OEM blatantly refused to help me, claiming it has passed the time of return and for me, that is a bad customer service.In fact, OEM customer service is zero. Again, i was asked by Amazon to contact the manufacturer since the product is still within the one year warranty and the manufacturer asked that, the seller contact them directly  but the seller has refused to contact the manufacturer, i have written over five emails to OEM and they are insisting on not assisting me, and the question is, if they are genuine and they actually got the product from the manufacturer, why did they refused to contact them and for me that shows, OEM is stealing here so be beware of doing any business with them and the worst is that, OEM claimed the product has no WARRANTY, not in my widest dream, have i seen any electronic without a warranty and my greatest disappointment is the fact that, it is written on their product information that the item has a one year warranty. Please never buy this product and any OEM products if you don't want to be treated like me, right now, the phone doesn't even come on at all, it dose't pick up any signal,  and this is how it has been since i got it. Don't be deceived by OEM because they are not genuine. I know there is no one in the OEM store who will be happy to throw away $156.75 in six months in this bad economy and they sit there in their store telling me trash about their faulty and spilt product without thinking of helping me in any way.

It processes information so slowly that youd think it was an Atari Amiga. It basically has no hard drive memory. Take 4 pics and the  thing will start slowing down. I havent tried any other touch screen phones but i gotta say  only tinkerbell would be able to write in this puppy without having to press the wrong letters and backtracking several times on a conversation. Forget about chatting at your normal speeds. Nicole Richie cant tame this POS. The camera is good but it takes so long to get ready youll never capture any important moment. The voice activated feature seems to be developed by Helen Keller(she was deaf too, i googled it) as it NEVER ONCE got a correct name. People would see me in the street yelling at the phone NOOO, NOOO, NOOO.while giving me a differente option? \"Did you say Kyle?\" \"No its MIKE!!!\"Imagine that everytime it got me the wrong name(WHICH WAS 90% OF THE TIME) All of these happened when it worked properly.First thing that went was the keyboard. I have to hold the phone vertically for the letters S, A, M, N, P and enter and horizontally for the rest. After that every  touch option started malfunctioning. The contacts options, the call history function and even the dialing option!!! A phone you cant make calls from!!! I had to to turn the thing on and off at least 3 times a day(it took about 3 minutes to restart each time). This is the only tech device created by man that  has made me BEG. I would ask it in submissive manner to please wOrk just this time for this important call and i would promise not to bother it anymore that day.I cant imagine a company making something this horrid unless it was a voluntary attempt to avenge the wrongful imprisonment of a loved one. If your wife gives this to you, you could use in court as evidence of psychological abuse. This is the William Hung of cellphones and you will think youre being PUNKED. Youre not.

book on the box, the box that shows on the picture is a box from Blackberry, and I received one from Verizon, the entrance from the mini USB for the charger is scratch, that means that the phone is not new, the earphones entrance is also scratch, at the back of the phone there is a knock. The USB cable is from LG and it doesn't work properly, the only way to make it work is pushing the charger. The wall charger is scratch and this one is definitely not working. The Verizon box is also scratches.  As I can see in the Amazon Page that there 3 prices. USED 114 USD, Refurbished from 110 USD. I paid for this one 142 USD and definitely this is NOT new. At this moment I'm trying to charge the Phone, of course pushing the charger and it only turns on one red light.  I hope after 24h it will work normally.

I like to figure out things myself and if I really can't figure it out, then it's just not for me. I'm simple minded, straight to the point and if it's too difficult to get from A to B then forget it. Don't have patience for it.The main uses for my phone is texting, wake up alarm, taking pictures, calling and once a while go online.So here are my issues:Texting: Didn't have any contacts saved. So when someone texted me with their name, I couldn't figure out how to save the number. Usually when you get a text and you want to save the number, you choose on the menu 'save contact' or something similar. With this phone, when I saved it, it saved the whole text to the saved folder. Anything else on the menu that I clicked, didn't give me the option to save the contact.Wake up alarm: I need more than 1 alarm. At least 3. I can't put more than 1 alarm in. Doesn't give me the option to in the 'clock' menu. So I have to reset the time for the alarm twice a day and occasionally in the weekends. Not cool. Should be able to have multiple alarms and just turn those on or off.Taking pictures: Very disappointing with how blurry this camera is and how much it lags to take the picture after pressing the button. Does it really need to think for 2 seconds after I press the button? For what? Just take the darn picture already!Calling: Alright, you got me. Calling is fine. However, I'm not fond of being on the phone. The shorter the better. I did have some problems with the touch screen though. When I call an automated service and I need to press 1 for English or enter my account number, it just won't take.Which takes me to the next issue I have. The touch screen.I've had phones with both capacitive and resistive touch screens but this is taking it a little too far. It swivels when you press towards the edge and you really have to press it harder than any other touch screen because yes, you have to press the WHOLE screen down.I've only had it for two weeks and it's been giving me so much grief that every day I have to use it, my despise for it grows larger.The simplest (to me simple) things are so difficult to do with this phone that it's frustrating me. When I get my new phone, someone would need to restrain me from throwing it against the wall and stomping on it because that's what I really want to do with it.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Sawyer", "ReviewID": "R1BEWQIDXFFY84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey all I work in Iraq and I receive the balckberry before 4 weeks ago and it's amazing phone and it's working in anywhere , u can use also the blotooth for songs and pic and everythings u want .

I'm from Portugal and I live in the states , I would like a phone with other language possibilities...I received a second email from ross cellular offering me 35 dollars refund to remove my feedback. How is this even allowed? My frustration, discontent and unsatisfaction are worth 35 dollars? Thank you But i rather loose this money and tell the truth. The phones should be working with any sim card as i received them and this didn't happen, i lost time and had a great effort to make them work because i'm not an expert on activating phones...", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Unlocked Phone", "Author": "Julie M.

Yo vivo en Colombia, y el operador con que tengo mi cuenta celular de voz y de datos es Comcel. Despues de sincronizar el celular, funciono bien para la parte de voz, reconocio perfectamente la SIM card, el problema fue el plan de datos.  Yo antes NO tenia Blackberry, asi que tenia que hacer el cambio de plan de datos de celular normal a BB, cuando fui a Comcel dijeron que han tenido muchos problemas con esta referencia 9530 Storm, y que es el unico que NO esta homologado para ellos (al parecer los otros operadores -movistar-Tigo si), asi que no me podian hacer el cambio de plan de datos.  La solucion fue llevar otro BB para que quedara registrado en el sistema y luego cambiar la SIM a mi celular para que funcionara... Hasta ahora de esa forma funciona bien el plan de datos a veces se cae el PIN pero regularmente funciona bien. lo malo fue hacer todo ese proceso que me tomo mucho tiempo sin poder usar mi plan, pero si lo segui pagando... otro problema que tiene el celular es que la pila dura muy poco, usandolo regularmente me dura un dia o un poco menos. otra cosa es que no reconoce los contactos de la SIM del celular, esto no se si es problema de la configuracion y debo hacerle algo, o simplemtene no los reconoce... entonces yo marco por el nombre y dice que la marcacion esta errada, toca digitar el numero siempre!.Pienso que para el precio el celular funciona, al menos, pero tiene los problemas que mencione anteriormmente. Hay que pensar en los beneficios que uno prefiere, algo de calidad y mas costoso, o algo que simplemente funcione o aveces no pero a un precio moderado. espero les sirva mis comentarios. Y si alguien sabe como debo configurar mi telefono para que no tenga que marcar el numero de mis contactos en vez de buscarlo en mi telefono le agradeceria la ayuda.Bought this phone 15 days ago, and at first I thought that I could not activate it. I live in Colombia, and the operator that I have my mobile voice and data is COMCEL. After synchronizing the cell, it worked well for the voice, recognized perfectly the SIM card, the problem was the data plan. I did not have Blackberry before, so I had to make the switch from regular data plan to BB plan, when I went to Comcel they said that they have had many problems with this reference 9530 Storm, and is the ONLY one not approved for them (apparently the other operators, Movistar, Tigo works with that reference), so I could not make the change of plan data. The solution was take another BB to stay logged into the system and then change the SIM to my phone to function ... Until now this way works well, the PIN of the data plan sometimes falls but regularly works well. The thing was that the whole process took a long time while I could not use my plan, but still paying ... another problem with the phone is that the battery have a very short duration, using it regularly this works a day or a little less. Another thing is that it does not recognizes the SIM contacts in the telephone, I don't know if it is a configuration problem and I must do something, or just does not recognize them ... then I mark the name and says that tagging is wrong, always i must dialing the number!.I think for the price the phone works at least, but has the problems that I mentioned before. You have to think of the benefits that you would prefer, something of quality and more expensive, or something that just works and sometimes not, but at a moderate price. I hope that my review help you to take the best choice.

It's pretty weird at first, but you'll get used to it. As for the actual phone usage, it's a decently usable phone. It's fairly easy to use and all of the essential functions such as calling and messaging are fully functional. There are a few problems with this phone:1. The battery life deteriorates pretty quickly over time if you're not careful2. If you're using it with any carrier other than Verizon, the data is pretty slow3. There aren't many apps that you can use with itHowever, it's a pretty durable phone.

I wanted to upgrade from a Blackberry Curve so I was excited about the larger screen and the touch screen features which indeed are nice.  I forgot to check the specs though.  It has no Wi-fi.  Apparently that's the difference between the 9530 and the 9550.  Like I said I am using this as an mp3 player and have no use for the phone features (except for installing programs).  I ended up having to install 9530 programs on the Blackberry Curve and then switching out the card.  I honestly don't know how you would get programs like audible installed without having a compatible device that has wi-fi.  That being said.  now that I have my programs installed it is a great mp3 player.  Much more versatile then the curve thanks to the touch screen.  all of my family has I-phones and it makes me laugh when they spend 20 minutes trying to get a song off the computer onto their phones.  I just drag the files onto the SD drive and they work.  I wanted to say something about the camera because It's something I rarely use on a phone.  They are always too blurry and useless to comment on.  This one however is quite nice.  It has a focus feature that I didn't see on the Curve.  You set your finger on the screen and it will focus, apply pressure and it takes an actually nice quality photo,  In a darker room it shines a bright led light for a flash.

I was hoping that since the Storm 9530 is newer technology, that it would be a better product. Wrong.PROS:  None that I can think of. Maybe the sleek appearance, that's it.CONS:  * The touch screen is very quirky, switches from speaker to handset at will.  * Touch screen keyboard - the keys too tiny to allow accurate typing. Very annoying. Frequently used keys such as \"&\", \"@\" and \"comma\" are buried in two or three layers. You have to keep switching back and forth.  * Texting is very frustrating - annoyingly suggests words, and changes into letters you did not type. Even when I turned off dictionary and auto-type feature, it would not work.  * Even when I reset to factory settings and re-installed software, it would not erase previous owner's phone number. The carrier could not fix problem.  * Most annoying, calls go straight into voice mail even phone is turned on and sitting in front of me.  * If a call comes in when you're already on another call, you have a constant beep in your ear continuing long after that second call had ended. The constant beep forces you to abandon your original call.  * Vibrate feature too low  - it's almost silent, and you may miss a call with the phone right in front of you.  * Numerous other quirks too many to name.Simply avoid this phone. If you must buy it, make sure it is returnable within at least 30 days.There's not much good I can say about this phone, other than that it boots up slightly faster than my Curve 8900. I'm putting it up for sale; I'll be returning to the older Curve 8900, or I may ditch Blackberry altogether and go for Android phone.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Oswald Barreto", "ReviewID": "R1GAR0DD9B24OU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent, meets my expectations when it comes to quality, functionality and handling of the product, besides the remarkable physical conditions", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not unlocked!", "Author": "Julieann", "ReviewID": "R1KIA0UY0IB4OY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone was locked, although I ordered an unlocked phone.
