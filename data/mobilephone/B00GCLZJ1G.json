{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone. Contract Free.", "Author": "Eduardo T. Rivera", "ReviewID": "R3UBQOIITYC3L6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is a great upgrade... Great package, great price. Better value to buy directly from Google.Top Concern prior to buying this phone... I was worried about the battery comparing the N5 to its temolate G2. Battery has lasted me at least 16hrs every day (4hrs off full charge today and I at 93%).It's got the specs. Literally everything is so smooth. When I intend on doing something, the phone handles it perfect. When I don't, the phone doesn't surpirse me. KitKat and this device is paired wonderfully.Some concerns for others have been camera, but in my usage camera has been more than sufficient. The stock GUI is a little wonky, but if I care about my photos, I'll take my DSLR. If you want a phone for the camera, grab an HTC One.Screen is beautiful. I didn't want a huge phone - the minimal bezels on the sides and on-screen buttons make this phone very easy to hold, even with a 5\" screen.It's soft in the hand. And I really like the subtlety of ceramic volume rocker and power button.In DFW you pretty much have your choice of good-to-great service anywhere. Combining no contract service, my limited usage of minutes, and this phone makes it a no brainer value to me.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great as 450$ phone, not good as a premium phone", "Author": "King James", "ReviewID": "RA9AQ1T2DF5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me just say this up front.  I don't like the fact that Sprint and all the other carriers are charging 450$ for a phone that Google on Google Play is charging 350$.  This is another way for these cell phone companies to keep the consumer under their thumb.  But, with that being said, the key word for me \"price,\" and for the price I really do like the Nexus 5, although I do have a few complaints about it.  Let me begin by saying that the white version of this phone and the black version are surprisingly distinct from each other.  I had believed that the white and the black version were the same exact phone just like every other black/white variation of every phone.  But they aren't.  First, they come in different looking boxes.  Just something that I'd thought i'd share.  Secondly, the earpiece (where the ear is when taking a call) on the white version is white while the black one blends into the black borders of the phone. Moreover, the white Nexus 5 is glossy around the sides whereas the black Nexus 5 has dull black sides,  Something to think about if one really cares about fingerprints on their phone (personally, I like the white version).  Now with that out of the way, the things that I do like about this phone is that it is very snappy and quick when swiping and bringing up applications, more so than some of the better spec phones such as the Note 3.  Another thing I like about the phone is it is light but it doesn't feel cheap.  It has a build that feels good in your hands.  And, the resolution on the screen is pretty damn good.  I am pretty impressed by the definition and detail when looking at the screen, and colors look great.  Now that's good news, but here is the bad news.  One of the first things that I've noticed when using the Nexus 5 is that the speaker is pretty weak.  It is not loud at all, and at full blast I couldn't hear the person on the other line when I was out in public.  Another thing that this phone is not good at doing is staying alive.  What I mean by this is that on one full charge, the phone will last about 4 to 5 hours max with regular usage.  If I don't use the phone much I may get a few more hours of standby time.  This bothered me because I need my phone throughout the day and I'm not always near an outlet, plus there's no way to open the phone and throw in a replacement battery. So, that definitely is a large negative for me.  Finally, another weak point on this phone is the camera.  Although the phone has a decent 8 mega pixel camera, the pictures I take in good light are not of great quality.  The pictures seem to be not of the right colors and it seems to dull the light out a bit.  Furthermore,  I can't take rapid fire pictures as each successive picture taken requires a about 2-3 second delay between each other.  But, the camera is surprisingly good at taking low light pictures.  As a matter of fact, the Nexus 5 camera in low light is better than some of the more premium phones with better cameras.  This is something that I really enjoy about the Nexus 5's camera.  Overall, if I was to rate this phone as a regular priced phone, (650-750$) or 200$ with a 2 year contract, I would probably give it 3 stars due to all the flaws (camera, speaker , battery life) the phone has.  But, for a 450$ phone or 50$ on a 2 year contract, this phone is exceptional.  It is exceptional because it functions very well as a smart phone (the touch screen is very quick and responsive and on 4G the internet is quick) and it has great screen resolution.  Personally I bought this phone outright for 450$ and I am happy with it.  But, I think I wouldn't be as happy if I paid 700$ for it.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good, but might need to contact Sprint to help activate. Also verify you plan is correct.", "Author": "Richard M. Thurman", "ReviewID": "R1SM8YBIOM3LP1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is an upgrade from a Galaxy S2 so I expected it to be a significant change as far as capability which it most certainly is. I've only had it for a day and a half so i really can't judge battery life yet which is a concern going to a fixed battery phone, but speed and performance is great. Sprint LTE in my area is decent so streaming full 1080 over the wireless network is good although it's not something I plan on doing often, but it is a good test for both the phone and network. Sprint is scheduled to start what they call SPARC next year which will use all three bands for data simultaneously which I am eager to try. There is very little Sprint Bloatware installed which was nice to see, but there is some. I also had to take the phone into a Sprint store to get it activated. I could have called customer service most likely, but the store was just down the block. One other thing to note was that when I ordered the phone through Amazon I changed my plan to the new all data for life, but when I took it into the store was told I still had my old plan. The service guy at the store changed it for me.This was one of the three options I was looking at for an upgrade. The other two were LG-G2 and the Moto-X. A friend has the Moto-X and is happy as has some nice value added like the trusted zones which I really wish this phone had, but I am still very happy with my choice. The screen is definitely not an OLED as the blacks are not totally black and the colors can seen a bit washed out. For the price point of the off contract phone something had to give and it was the choice in screen. I don't mind it at all as I use the phone as a communication and productivity device mainly and I'd much rather have more computing power than a perfect screen. Also some reviews I've seen have disliked the camera. The camera is fine, but is slow to get into action/focus. I understand that this will be addressed in a software update in the future. I mainly use the a camera phone for documenting things as opposed to getting the perfect shot. I have a bunch of DSLR equipment for that. So far I am very pleased with the phone, but it has only been a few days. I'm giving it 4/5 due to the screen and camera not being perfect, but would not hesitate to make the same choice again at this time.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Black gold", "Author": "Phil", "ReviewID": "R1XLD6WPKIY10R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought mine thru Sprint's upgrade program since I get an employee discount on the monthly charges via a friend.  The initial setup at the Campus Sprint store took a while as it had to update the OS to Kit Kat- apparently out of the box. Since then I have gotten a couple Kit Kat updates from Google. One of them supposedly fixed the camera lag issue.  I am not a big user of phone cameras, but the few I have taken look good, and the camera software and functions are idiot proof. I also dig having the camera available from the lock screen, and that you can scroll thru pics and back to the live camera with ease.  Phone build quality is tight, and the case I bought separately on Amazon fits well, although the power button can be a little difficult to use at first, and some USB chargers do not fit snug with it.  No fault of the phone itself.  The battery seemed to drain faster for the first week or so, but that was most likely from me playing around with it a lot, or perhaps the phone battery or software itself adapting to my usage?  The only gripe I have is the new phone dialing screen in Kit Kat makes it easy to dial a number by mistake while scrolling thru call history, But this is more user error than anything.  SD card option and replaceable battery would be nice, but are not deal killers in my book. The speakers are adequate and call quality seems good. (There is only one speaker for the speakerphone on the bottom, the other is the mic.)By far the main reason to buy this phone is the automatic software updates from Google mean this phone's Android software will stay up to date, and it comes with zero provider phone company bloatware.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone and feels premium despite price tag", "Author": "ZoZuniga", "ReviewID": "R2C0VBQU9FGX0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I got these phones as part of the Cyber Monday promotions and have not looked back.  Our previous phones were Samsung Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch through Sprint.  The service was horrible on those phones so I spent a lot of time researching whether it was the phones or the service.  Turns out when Sprint switched to 4G LTE, the neglected everything 4G so we were stuck with 3G and roaming (mostly roaming) despite living in Oklahoma City (not the surrounding suburb, the city).  We didn't want to let go of our Unlimited Data Plans so we stuck with Sprint for one last go and we could not have chosen a better phone to maximize everything around us.  The processor is super fast, graphics are crystal clear, the Spark means I have had amazing speed away from the wifi in my house.The 2 issues we have had with it are as follows: - When turning off the screen, about half the time it takes at least 15 seconds to get the screen to turn back on. - The battery is pretty small compared to similar style phones, but since there is no \"bloatware\" I have hardly noticed a difference from previous battery sizes to this one.  I will say that getting a Task Killer app and setting it to close all applications regularly and setting its \"Kill Level\" at the highest level really does help extend the battery life.Overall, I'm very happy with this phone.  It took me a while to get used to some of the customization, taking for granted that \"full\" texting and voicemail apps are not initially installed, but I don't even think about the new apps I now have.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Sirwankel", "ReviewID": "R112P3X5WCPJH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would kinda consider myself a power user.

Kempe", "ReviewID": "R1K2RNG3O7QFG2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm going to start this out with a preface. I have been on Android since Eclair, so my comfort level with the software is not an issue.I won't go so far as to say there is a learning curve to Android, but I will say that anyone can pick up this phone, make calls send texts, surf the web. Where this phone shines is after that. Those are simply prerequisites in the smartphone realm so any review of, \"It's great for phone calls...\" aren't helpful. That being said, it operates well on those key items.The devil is in the details on this phone though. When the bloatware and manufacturer skins are stripped away, Android is fast and very clean. On this Nexus with the advanced specs, it's astonishing how quick things are.I have had an S3, Evo 4G, and numerous experiences on other android devices as well as a year with an iPhone 4S in my pocket alongside my android phones.The screen is an 'A' it is very sharp, true to color and of good size without feeling like I am carrying around a tablet.Memory is adequate, I would have preferred the 32, but with Drive connectivity and faster mobile networks, I feel like on-device storage will be a dodo bird in 2 years.Processing and RAM are top notch. There may be phones with faster or more, but with the reduced bloatware and interference of skins, the Nexus is faster. It just has less to shovel every time you ask it to function.Build quality. It's a black phone with soft-feel plastic and a gorilla glass screen. It's better than Samsung, it's behind the new HTC M8, and in my opinion ahead of it's pricepoint. The phone in your hands will leave you complaining about very little.Battery life is adequate. Everyone has a different view of this. If you are coming from a phone that can go for a week without charging (feature phones) you will complain. If you are coming from a 2-year old Android device, you'll be fine with it, in fact you might even be happy with it.So ultimately, who should buy this phone?- Tech savvy people who want to really customize their smartphone experience- People who hate bloatware on their phone- The Not-Another-Samsung/Apple crowd- People looking for the most screaming deal on a product that will always have the newest softwareAnd the final question, \"Hey Joe, should I buy this phone?\"Are you someone listed above? Then yes. If not, Are you a fan of Apple, or would you rather have a desktop with widgets that you can change infinitely to your heart's content? Go nuts kid, this one's for you.At the end of the day, you need to figure out where you put your priorities when grabbing any one of the \"Premiere\" smartphones. If you don't want to answer any questions about what you bought, get the iPhone and go along with the crowd. If you want the best camera, Nokia and Samsung are really the only players there. If you top priority is build quality, the M8 destroys all others. But if what you want is the least amount of useless stuff tied to a phone with a very good camera and fast interactions and always the newest software, this is your phone.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone until it breaks...", "Author": "R.

Main concern, no microSD card slot. Sound volume is low even at highest setting. This becomes a concern when driving in highways. I have to use a powerful bluetooth speaker. Otherwise this is a great device. I knew the limitations, still bought one. Look at my video review of Nexus 5 Black phone.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don't advertize or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version): 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5\" is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, but after using Note for a while, I don't use it as a primary phone. The display in Nexus 5 is absolutely stunning with a Super AMOLED display and you have to see to feel it! I like it as much as Galaxy S4 and S5.ANDROID UI:Nexus 5 has Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. User Interface has a flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently to my friends shows the details of processes. battery usage like which process takes up more battery and it is geeky and impressive.CAMERA:This can just replace a point and shoot camera. Wait, what is a point and shoot camera?! Very impressive. I use it sometimes, but my Nikon D90 still the workhorse.PROCESSING POWER:Don't bother about it. For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.Qi WIRELESS CHARGING:BIG PLUS on Nexus 5 phones. Very convenient. Period.NFC Tags:Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. Get bunch ( I mean around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example in my S4, when I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both.Micro SD card!!BIG BUMMER. I am so used to SD card and having tons to stuff. I am feling the pain.OTG - USB Hosts:This is also often ignored feature in many reviews. On the GO USB cable + Nexus 5 means you can use with external hard disks, and virtually many of USB devices. If you have a thumb drive and have files, you can in fact read with a phone and don't necessarily have to open a laptop. works out of the box.BATTERY:Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don't. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!MISC FEATURES:GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Look at my video review.To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), TOM TOM, , Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Currents (nice way to read News), Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they have for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google VoiceAsk questions.

I sent it back to Amazon and got a brand new replacement, but I had much lower expectations, but never did I expect my NEW (not refurbished) replacement to go bad too.Once again, a few weeks into using the replacement phone, it failed on me. One night, the backside of the phone began to get really hot. I thought it was because I had poor service. The phone continuously got hotter until finally, the screen blacked out. I tried troubleshooting with the help of Sprint, Amazon and the manufacturer and they were stumped too. Their only advice was to get a replacement.There I was again, ordering a replacement phone for the SECOND TIME in less than TWO MONTHS. That means I was on my THIRD phone within 8 weeks - absurd by any standards. I don't know what happened, but Google really dropped the ball with the build quality of this phone, in my opinion.It's been a month with the 3rd phone, and no issues yet.Overall, when I wasn't busy replacing my phone, I have enjoyed using it.

I love the simplicity, and the lack of all the bloatware.  No redundant Sprint and Samsung apps; just pure Android.  I like that the phone uses the app switcher button instead of a menu button.  All the apps seem to be going to the menu selector built into the apps, negating the need for the traditional menu button, and now that I'm used to the app switch button I have really come to appreciate it.  I never really used it too much on my GS3 because of the press and hold on the home button.  Camera works great, and the phone gets a good signal for me.  Battery life has been excellent as well (I don't use Skype so I haven't had the camera battery drain issue present in 4.4.2).  The IPS screen isn't as over saturated as the AMOLED screen on the GS3, and after a week of use it is settling in nicely (never judge your display until it's had time to \"burn in\").  The phone is really fast and very smooth.  Is it as feature rich as a GS4?  No.  But, for the way I use a smartphone it's perfect.

If you add the speed to the price of this bad boy ($35) with an upgrade it is a great steal. The touch screen was stunning and the camera was...eh so so.

To me that is too big for a phone and I am a pretty nerdy 18 year old who loves technology and couldn't stand not getting one of the best phones on the market. Just go to BestBuy or use your friends phone for a while to see how you do with the size. Also put the phone in your pocket and see how it feels.

Wong", "ReviewID": "R2P49VNIL4JV07", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the Nexus 5 from a Nexus S 4G. An issue I had with my previous phone was how underpowered it was. After two years' worth of Android system updates, my old phone was pretty slow. A major problem with the Nexus S was the partitioning of the storage space into 2GB and 14GB divisions, which compounded the speed problem with memory issues as well. The Nexus 5 does not have either of these problems because of the new multi-core processor inside, and the entire 16GB of storage space is a single partition and accessible for both installation of apps and storage of photos, etc.The Nexus 5 is very slim and sleek, but many of the cases available for it square off the slightly rounded edges of the phone in addition to adding thickness to the phone, making it a little chunky. This may be a reasonable trade-off if a case prevents your screen of becoming damaged when your phone is dropped.The screen on the Nexus 5 is large and bright. You may want to turn the brightness setting down to conserve battery life, as the screen is responsible for as much as a third of my total battery consumption over the course of the day. With respect to the physical size of the phone, using it one-handed could be difficult if you have small hands. I wear medium/large size gloves, and have no problem with this. The large screen certainly helps with typing using the on-screen keyboard. Far fewer missed keys compared to my older phone.I bought this phone on/around Cyber Monday, so it was on sale for $35 on Amazon for a device upgrade with Sprint. The price may have changed since then. If you're looking to buy the phone off-contract, the Google Play store may be a better deal.When upgrading my phone, I was also considering the HTC One and the Moto X, which are both also great phones. I decided to go with the Nexus 5 because I prefer to run an Android phone without additional manufacturer-specific skins on top. These skins often add features or visual effects I don't use but will still consume system resources. Additionally, the Nexus 5 has a high repairability score from iFixit, which is also important to me. If a part of the phone breaks, I'd rather replace the broken part than buy a whole new phone. The Moto X also has a high repairability score, but the HTC One is not really repairable at all. Another advantage of the Nexus devices are the speed with which they receive Android system updates. You can read more about that elsewhere. Specific to the Nexus 5, the camera software was not particularly good upon launch of the phone in November. By the time I purchased and activated my phone in December, a new system update had been issued, and the camera software was upgraded in that release. The photos taken with the Nexus 5 rival those taken with my friend's iPhone 5, if that is a concern for you. I don't have a comparison to the iPhone 5S.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone", "Author": "Andres A Abreu", "ReviewID": "R21LT4A96C18NF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone, quick and snappy.

Battery lasts me 22+ on stand by with minimal usage. I recommend getting the 32gb version, as I can see people going through the 16gb pretty quickly. Note: this is a bare bones phone. That means it has very little  bloatware, but also no Sense(like)UI. But that's an advantage. You can then pick n choose apps u like and want. The Google voice feature is remarkably accurate. The swype keyboard input is more intuitive than the one on the htc evo. But takes a few tries to get used to. NFC is flawless on this. I'm finding new features on this phone everyday. Highly recommend this phone.I got mine here on amazon for $30 with 2 yr contract with my carrier, Sprint. Sprint unveiled their SPARK network which is an enhanced lte. I was able to unlock the 2 bands associated with this new spark network. I am in NYC, and get better bandwidth than all of my friends who are on verizon/tmonile/att, a steady 15-20MB down, and 10 up and I have clocked at as high as 50-60GB. As they roll out more towers it will support 100+ MB over their radio signal. There are only 4 other phones that support SPARK, the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini, Galaxy Mega, HTC One Max, and LG G2.If this deal is still available. JUMP ON IT! Otherwise get the 32GB from google's website. My order came in from amazon literally in 2 days with standard shipping, as it almost always does with amazon. Can't say enough good things about amazon and this product. def get a case for it though, but any techie knows that. I got SUPCASE Google Nexus 5 Unicorn Beetle Premium Hybrid Protective Case (Black/Black), also through amazon. it was on sale, the openings for the ports are perfect size, and above all else the power and volume buttons are also covered by the case, thus protecting it.

If the camera was something that turned you away from the Nexus 5, then come back because the issue has been fixed. Google says they will keep working on the camera to make it even better.(Stay tuned for any other updates)Original Review:I sold my S3 to get this phone on the Google Play Store and I recommend you do as well (It costs less on the Google Play Store)[...] The total ends up being less than $400 for a smart phone that is priced way to low for what it has to offer.Pricing:$350- 16 GB$400- 32 GBA Snapdragon 800 Quad-Core Processor clocked at 2.3 Ghz?

No waiting for months to get the next version of androidCons:-Because it only packs a 2300 mh battery, it does ok for daily use, but don't expect to get any crazy battery life, (Standby time is amazing though, it sipped through only a 1% of battery through the whole night!)-Camera is decent, but video quality is great! The mic is the best I have seen on any smart phone, (A software update may improve camera)-Availability, I love this phone, but getting your hands on one can take a bit, but please believe me, it is worth the wait!-Speaker is just all right, it sounds OK but not greatTotal Scores:Build Quality: 9/10User Experience: 10/10Android Kit-Kat (Nexus 5 Experience): 10/10Camera (Photos): 7/10Camera (Video): 9/10Speaker: 7/10Summery:If you looking for a phone that delivers the best Android Experience, a cheap off contract phone, a phone with great specifications, or just a phone in general, This is the best phone currently on the market.

I've used a variety of Samsung, Moto, and LG phones and even after owning this for a month, I'm still in love with my Nexus 5.  The screen is big, bright, and sexy.  The phone is fast and very responsive.  I've always thought that screen rotation was slow on my old Droids, but this one is very fast. I mostly surf the web, check email and play the occasional game on my phone while I'm waiting for a doctor/dentist appointment or a meeting.  For these purposes I have no complaints.  With previous phones, I bought and used other apps instead of the built-ins (like the camera app).  With the new camera app that comes with KitKat, I don't have any complaints.  I use it instead of the app I paid for a couple years ago.  Also, I easily rooted this phone in about five minutes.  Instructions are easily found online.  I haven't tried a custom ROM yet, though.As for the downsides...1) It's hungry.  It eats through your battery charge like a hungry hippo.  Fortunately, the charger is fast.  I can charge my phone from 10% to a full charge in about 90 minutes, maybe less.2) There is no replacing the battery or adding an SD card.  This phone is sealed and intended to stay sealed.3) The charging plug is on the bottom.  This is minor, but I'm used to it being on the top.4) The speaker is on the bottom, right where I put my fingers when holding the phone with both hands.  Often I can't hear the phone when I'm holding it, because I forget to move my big fat finger.5) Sprint's 4G LTE service isn't great where I live and tend to visit.

Second is that Hangouts (default messaging app on this phone) and Sprint have a character limit of 160 in place for SMS messages. Rather than build out your text as one long message and send to the recipient as 1/3, 2/3, etc, you have to cut yourself off and send in 160 character chunks.

Its as beautiful as black iPhone 5S and Kitkat OS is on par (actually better) with iOS. You can say its bigger iPhone (I mean it) because Android OS is more flexible, customizable and powerful and it is bigger than in size like its big brother. The bigger size definitely helps in games and all kind of media consumption.This device performance is buttery smooth and the overall experience inspires utmost satisfaction. Given its size it feels so light and slim even compared to iPhone 5/5s.It is not even best nexus device so far but best out yet among all.And now I will explain it.--------------------------1. Design, look and build quality-> I differ here from most reviewers who says its plain or boring and nothing stands out of this. Its as good looking as black (space gray) iPhone 5S. Its all black like iPhone 5s. Though its made of plastic its feels sturdy, well built with precision only known to Apple. And for the people who tell iPhone made of aluminum, Nexus 5 sides appears no inferior to iPhone 5S black sides. The front glass is very well fused with the body with almost no gaps. Now what we are left with? Back? The back of Nexus 5 is though made of plastic it feels very good in the hand and due to its matte finish does not seem to slip off.Now one step further...iPhone 5S black (or space gray) seems to have identity crisis of being black or something else, Nexus 5 black is perfectly black and it has got radically different sides (not plain round rectangle which all other smartphones have). The sides are beautifully something else.iPhone 5S beauty is revealing and Nexus 5 beauty being black is mysterious and never gets boring.I love this black beauty and don't blame for my taste as they said \"beauty lies in the eyes of beholders\".\"Simplicity is Beauty and Beauty is simplicity, nothing more, nothing less.\" - Oscar Wilde. If any phone on the market lives up to the Oscar Wilde's quote its Nexus 5.In short its unapologetically simple\".2. Processor/speed-> Buttery/silky smooth. Neck to neck with iPhone 5s and second only to Note 3 for all practical purposes.3. Screen/display-> Awesome. Its better than retina any time as its full HD. The feeling of display being washed up goes away very soon and remember the so called best retina have the same problem as they share the same display technology.4. Ecosystem-> Android eco system is as good as Apple's. In fact I find it better because of Android OS power you have kind of powerful applications which Apple fan boys can never have. Apple fan boys just give a try to 'tasker' (Warning: Only if you can handle Android's raw power.)5. Powerful Soul-> \"Fools are those who don't want their souls to be powerful.\" Its as good as iOS but better why? because its powerful and customizable. You can do the things with it when you need. Its no way comparable to inferior iOS. Apple fan boys! People should not be proud of a system which does not even let them change default for anything.6. Call Quality -> Fantastic. I have never had so clear voice on call for very long.7. Network Signal Quality -> Fantastic.8. Volume/Speaker-> Inherently the speaker is very loud. Though in some application it might sound a little short of enough but its software related problem and should be fixed in future update. I have tested the volume in many application like play and in some apps are freaking load. While playing music through play I had to cut down on the volume in car its so powerful.With headphones its fantastic. The voice quality is very superior and has no noise in it. Its as pure as it gets.9. Camera-> I have seen all the comparisons of Nexus 5 with all leading phones (HTC one, Nokia Lumia, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4) and its competing neck to neck in every department except its little slow to focus. But once it focus it takes very good images. HDR+ beats all other phones (I swear it). But again Google admitted it was software related issue and would be fixed soon through update. Personally I am pretty satisfied with the camera.Its at least best nexus phone camera and comparable to others except in little slower to focus. The photos are very detailed with accurate colors.Note: I have uploaded some photos for reference.10. Battery-> No complaints. Nothing great or bad here. Its definitely better than many old phones (including galaxy nexus) and equal to many others.It just falls short of only two smart phones right now which are LG G2 and Note 3. But it's battery is comparable to the best smartphone i.e. iPhone 5s. So if iPhone 5S can be the best with that kind of battery I don't understand how we could complain of Nexus 5. For casual usage you will charging it once a day. The noticeable thing is that in idle mode it does not eat battery at all and that's where it will average out better end of the day.11. Reparability-> iFixit has given its 8 of 10 in this department and you should feel comfortable saving your money on costly repair by doing many things yourself and the whole assembly is modular.Summary-> Even keeping its lower price aside, Its the one of best smart phone and should equal or better any best smart phone on the planet right now.

It is way more responsive than my old Galaxy S2. The 4G-LTE works better (by far) than the 4G-WIMAX on my S2--in some places, it is blazing fast.  I can't wait to see how the Sprint Spark network works...Being a \"stock\" Android phone, I don't have all the bloatware (good!)...but there are some widgets and stuff that I kinda miss from my old S2.  But, mostly, it's just getting used to a slightly different interface.  Oh...and it seems like every different Android uses a completely different set of stock \"sounds\"--so I'm having to get used to that!I've heard people say that the auto-brightness is wonky...but, so far, it's worked better on this phone than my last phone.Also, so far, the battery life is a lot better than my last phone (I think one of the upgrades did something that caused it to suck down my battery).The biggest downer so far relates to the memory.  After loading the stuff from the previous phone's SD card (this new one doesn't have an SD slot), I only have 2.5GB free.  That is likely to become a problem sooner rather than later.Also, with my Galaxy S2 using Sprint's 4G WiMax, I could talk on the phone and do Internet at the same time if I was in 4G coverage.  I miss that and hope they hurry up with Voice Over LTE which should bring that functionality back.What has me most excited...is that I hope to get more timely updates of the software.  The other devices I've had took some time to get new updates (even security patches) due to the convoluted steps needed to get the software to work with all the mods made by the manufacturer.
