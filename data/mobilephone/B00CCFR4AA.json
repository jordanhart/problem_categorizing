I like having a prepaid cell phone with no contact.  It was a nice way to get an iphone without paying the expensive cost.  The phone is working great.  I'm learning how to use it as I go.  I was able to transfer my current number with Straight Talk and I'm up and running.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "4s 16GB", "Author": "Amy Lewis", "ReviewID": "R1D6S7UVOVE47T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The product was used and in excellent condition.
