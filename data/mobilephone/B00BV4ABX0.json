Gentlemens, please do not buy ANYTHING with this seller. Is a BIG LIAR and A SWINDLER. I buy a Galaxy S4 for $800 and it damage in just 2 days, had a software problem and shuted down, I contact this seller (with only 2 days of use) and they sent me straight to samsung, when i talk to samsung they say the cellphone is belong to \"samsung africa\" and that I would have to call nigeria to claim the warranty. I was not willing to claim guarantees in nigeria because i bought my cell in USA for use in USA. I turn to contact this terrible seller and after more than 1 week of claims, they asked me for the cellphone's serial and IMEI number, and what was the WONDERFUL RESPONSE from them? They said that they HAD NOT sold that phone. After this, i placed the complaint to amazon and they said they would help me, they did, and they sent me an email saying that the seller accept and that i had to send the cellphone to the seller via fedex, I did, in it original packaging with all the plastic, all manuals and accessories in perfect condition, and do you know what was their WONDERFUL SECOND RESPONSE??? they said that they receive a CRACKED DISPLAY AND STOLEN ACCESSORIES. In conclusion, this SWINDLER stole me TWICE, first my money and then my cellphone, DO NOT EVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER. They did not attended my calls or emails anymore, THEY NEVER SEND ME BACK MY CELLPHONE.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "not a good phone", "Author": "penname", "ReviewID": "R3U2MT9QCSTVOW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't know if just me or not. the phone i got is not new. the box has been opened. also . the phone suppose to be made in Korea, however, this one is made in Vietnam.. be cautious before buying.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "SCREEN CRACKED", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "R1DWDA314GI89O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE ITS A PAPERWEIGHT.

Anyway, you won't need them!They just clutter your screen, your settings, and make everything look very complicated, for zero benefits.The worst: pre-installed Samsung software, that you CANNOT UNINSTALL. That's a real scandal.Samsung just doesn't know how to make good simple software on its phones.They think that by adding features, it's better. Sorry, it's NOT.When you get your phone from factory, the main pane is cluttered by apps you don't care about, making it uneasy to use apps you care about.I've spent hours moving Samsung bloatware away and disabling their apps that obviously drain the battery.Otherwise the phone is fast, with a beautiful screen. It would really make a great phone it was pure Android.As it is, it is ok for geeks, and to avoid for normal users", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy S4 S Iv I9500 16gb Black (Factory Unlocked) Full Hd 4.99\" ,...
