{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Best High End Phone Deal In America? Maybe", "Author": "D.L.C", "ReviewID": "RIXFZ8QNN6DW0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a long time Nexus brand user, owning the first generation Nexus 7 and Nexus 4. I also have an iPad 3 and an iPod Touch 4th generation. I wrote a lengthy Nexus 7 review before; here is my lengthy Nexus 5 review updated after over a month of straight usage. It should cover the vast majority of topics on the device. Let's get started on what possibly is the best high end phone deal in America.(1) Hardware:Personally, in my opinion, high to medium end devices from reputable brands have reached the point where most people won't be able to tell the difference or the difference won't be something they regularly use. That said, I'm still going to cover it, if you're not interested in the nerd talk about hardware, then all you need to know is that the phone is capable hardware wise for demanding users and honestly overkill for average users. Skip this section of my review and head on down to the camera portion.The device is built on a Qualcomm S800 Pro processor. Clocked at 2.2 GHz quadcore processor, the phone screams on speed. I'm not a fan of mobile benchmarks due to their inherent problems of actually measuring what they claim, but benchmarks all put the Nexus 5 at the moment in the top end of performance. Compared to my Nexus 7's Tegra 3, the Nexus 5 has a fighter jet engine compared to the first generation Nexus 7's turboprop engine.There's also a Hynix 2 GB RAM chip running at DDR3 1600 Mhz, and either a 16 GB or 32 GB Sandisk NAND memory chip depending which model you bought. Google is charging $50 more for the 32 GB device. That's about a 625% markup over wholesale NAND prices. Take that as you will.There are Bluetooth, NFC, GPS and unlike the Nexus 4, a slim-port compatibility, thus letting you connect the phone to a monitor or television screen. LG/Google kept the wireless charging from the Nexus 4, to which the wireless charger has to be purchased separately.The phone comes with an Adreno 330 graphics chip. I'm not a big mobile gamer, but this per the professional reviews and FPS benchmarks will handle every game out for Android. For non-gamers, the Adreno 330 is overkill.Microphone and talk clarity are on par with Nexus 4, meaning fine. Speaker seems to have more noise at higher volumes. Also, speaker is mono despite there being two grills at the bottom. One grill is for the microphone.Connects via standard USB, where the device itself has a microUSB connection. Plugging the device into your computer brings it up as another removable storage device where you can simply drop and drag files into folders. Easy file movement plus standard USB makes the device very simple to use and standard charging conventions make it easy to find chargers around your house and office. Sometimes the device goes wonky on USB connection (was a Nexus 4 issue as well), so just go into settings and storage, click on the settings (3 vertical boxes) and change the connection to PTP or MPT and the phone will reappear properly.Like all recent Nexus devices, no MicroSD slot and no removable battery. MicroSD slot is partially alleviated now that USB OTG works. See my \"other\" section for more details.You can find these specific parts on iFixit's tear down which gave it a solid 8/10 for user repair. For the low price of $349/$399, there is no other phone with this quality hardware that for the price.Right now, due to shortages in supply, many people are scalping the phones for profit. If you can wait, the phone will ship between 2 and 4 weeks and if the Nexus 4 timeline tells us anything, quickly reach the point where it's under a week. My phone took a little under 3 weeks to deliver from ordering it on the 1st of November.(2) Camera:The back camera is still an 8 megapixel and front is 1.3 megapixel, same as the Nexus 4. Low light has improved considerable and HDR+ alleviates many of lighting problems. HDR is a software/hardware combination that takes three photos, one underexposed, one overexposed and one regular and the software combines them to even out the lighting issues to produce the best possible shot. Graininess has been reduced as well. Google keeps the same minimal interface for the camera with the select and drag method for changing options.Image stabilization is so-so and the camera can be slow to focus at times. The Nexus 5 camera is an improvement over the Nexus 4, but a Lumia this is not.  Google released updates to the Android OS that had specific Nexus 5 camera fixes. The camera's improved, but it's still relatively slow at focusing. However, image quality has improved considerably as have night shots. The only real criticism now is that the camera is slow to focus.(3) Android 4.4 - Operating System:Google's latest and greatest is on display here. Android 4.4, otherwise known as Kitkat comes pre-installed on the phone. There are some changes from Android 4.3 Jelly bean. Like all Nexus devices, operating system updates are done over the air via Google. No waiting on device manufacturers or carriers.The launcher has changed and on the Nexus 5 (and it's exclusive to the Nexus 5), and widgets are now removed from the app screen and are accessed by pressing and holding down on a home screen.Icon sizes have been enlarged in the app library, and formatting has been tweaked.Android Run Time (ART) is now available as opposed to the stock Google Dalvik compiler. Allegedly, ART nets a handful more hours out of the device per some reviews, but I haven't noticed any difference. In theory, ART should speed up the device, but with the S800 Pro already blazing fast, it's questionable if anyone will notice, your mileage will vary. Also, some apps are broken under ART.Google has prominently placed Google search on the top of the phone and included the new function of simply talking to your phone to have it fulfill requests. Simply say \"Ok Google\" and the Google Now function loads up where you can ask questions or request information simply by talking to it. Phone has to be unlocked for it to work as opposed to the Moto X which I believe will work without unlocking.Hangouts has merged with text messaging for a combined app. As with all Android phones, you can download another app and make it your default over Hangouts. Currently the Hangouts change in my opinion was a mistake. Group texting via SMS has problems with sending, the app prioritizes sending to Gmail accounts over SMS and you can't mix SMS and Gmail group chats together. The separation in 4.3 was a better system.Google kept the Sywpe like typing option on its default keyboard (drag your fingers between keys rather than typing) and notification center appears to be the same from 4.3. Colors however for notification went from blue to white. Also the notification flashing light is still there from the Nexus 4. It's sort of like the Blackberry's red flashing LED, but at the bottom.Outside of the changes from 4.3, stock Android 4.3, stock meaning there's no \"skin\" over it such as Touchwiz or HTC's Sensation, runs extremely fast. Apps load instantly, everything is extremely responsive. This is not Android Honeycomb that was an unresponsive lag filled mess. It is however, less intuitive than iOS 6/7. Android verse Apple has always been like this and its personal preference. That said, if you're in to nearly complete customization, widgets, lock screen information and generally busting out of a walled garden to have your phone do what you want it to do, this is your cup of tea.(4) Battery Life:The battery life on the Nexus 5 is better than the Nexus 4. A slight boost of 200 mAh to 2,300 from 2,100 mAh is minor and it appears the gains are from the operating system primarily. Some user are reporting with ART, they can last a full day as opposed to 16 to 17 hours on Dalvik, some users are reporting the same battery life.After more than a month of the usage on the device, I find that battery life is generally superior to the Nexus 4 and going a whole day is not a problem. This isn't a Note 3 that will last all day gaming. Mileage will vary depending on your behavior.The biggest killer of battery aside from constant gaming is using LTE in an area with weak LTE signal. The phone (like all phones) will eat up huge amounts of battery trying to maintain the bad signal. Sometimes it will drain 20% of my battery in an hour or two on standby. Switching to 3G as the primary network reduces standby usage to a few percent over two or three hours.(5) Build & Looks:The phone comes in two colors, black and white. Note that the white version does not extend the white to the front; it's just the back panel.The phone is fairly light and considerably lighter than the Nexus 4. It is still a black rectangle like most smartphones. LG/Google have forgone the glass backing from the Nexus 4. This should significantly reduce real damage as the soft plastic backing is far less susceptible to shattering like glass. The phone is a bit thinner than the Nexus 4.Screen is 4.95 inches, with confirmed Gorilla Glass 3. The phone is using IPS which gives better clarity and color than the Nexus 4. Resolution is set at 1,920-by-1,080 pixel for a 445 pixel density (PPI). I'd still use a screen guard as the face drop test reveals that Gorilla Glass 3 is good for preventing scratches, but so-so to horrendously bad on impact resistance.Side bezels are very minimal, but the top and bottom bezels are still large. Overall, it's not going to wow people upon first look, but most of us are here for performance and pure Android, what excites us is not how a phone looks, but what we can do with it.(6) LTE & Carrier Support:Google is selling these phones completely unlocked, meaning that you can go to any carrier that supports its bands and it should work.Unlike the Nexus 4, the Nexus 5 is LTE enabled. This was a huge reason for me to get the Nexus 5 as I'm paying for T-Mobile's LTE on the simple plan but I wasn't able to access it. My local HSPA+ was topping out around 11 Mbp/s in the heart of Honolulu to a paltry 4 Mbp/s in my house away from the heart of the city. LTE has pushed urban speed to over 30 Mbp/s (per my last test) and my house to over 9 Mbp/s. Your mileage will of course vary.Nexus 5's LTE will work with bands on T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T.; Verizon has some LTE bands that the Nexus 5 doesn't support and Verizon and Google have some ideological issues that are preventing them from working together on the Nexus line. T-Mobile is selling the device non-subsidized at a $100 markup financed over 24 months at 0%. Sprint is selling the phone subsidized at $49 but you'll pay it all back and more through subsidy recovery fees built into the monthly bill. AT&T; isn't selling the device but will support BOYD Nexus 5. Be aware though, unless you're on AT&T;'s prepaid Aio service, you're still going to be paying for subsidy recovery fees even though you didn't get a subsidy from AT&T.;A lot of people don't seem to understand that the amount they pay for the phone on day one, usually $199 is not the total price they pay for the phone. That's the down payment. AT&T;/Sprint/Verizon and previously T-Mobile recover their subsidy via the fees they charge in their monthly. T-Mobile and other non-contract carriers have broken out of this model and give a dosage of transparency to monthly billings as to what is service fee and what is subsidy recovery. If you buy an unlocked phone from Google and take it to T-Mobile, you will not be charged a device fee. If you take it to Verizon/AT&T;/Sprint outside of their prepaid options, you will be charged a device fee even though you did not get a subsidy. This will vastly increase the total price you pay for your phone. Keep that in mind.The best deal for this phone if you don't talk much is T-Mobile's $30 a month plan for 100 minutes, unlimited text and 5 GB of LTE, unlimited 3G. Download Google Voice for data calling if you need more talk time. For two years of service, that's $1,069 in total monthly and phone bills. That's less than the cost of 10 months of Verizon.If you're looking at other plans, Apple has done an extremely fantastic job of comparing AT&T;, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile's myriad plans into a single nice webpage. Google \"iPhone Plans Comparison\" for the best simple comparison of American big carrier plans. Apple labels these \"iPhone Plans\" but they are generic smartphone plans that anyone on any compatible device can purchase.(7) Other:Unlike the Nexus 4, USB Hosting OTG works. I personally don't find this that important, considering that OTG is a hassle on a device that's constantly on the move, but it is a big change from the Nexus 4 which didn't apply sufficient voltage to power USB Hosting. If you're wondering what USB Hosting/OTG is, USB Hosting and \"On The Go\" lets a phone or tablet to plug in a USB device in and let the device via the right program access the storage on the USB device. I'm currently using the Nexus Media Importer (as I previously bought that for the Nexus 7) as it lets me do this without rooting. I was never a big memory user on my Nexus 4, but I know some people are. Google \"Meenova\" for a more compact design that will let you access MicroSD cards on your Nexus 5. See my picture in the photo gallery.When I first started the phone up, Google play strangely tried to download and install every app I'd previous bought. What gives? I had to manually stop the install of certain apps.Sound quality via headphones is solid, but depends also on the quality of your headphones/earphones. Sound on the speaker is relatively low.Rooting is available now and there are a few ROMs for the Nexus 5 if you wish to play around.Accessories are flooding Amazon as well as eBay for relatively affordable prices. I'm using the [AIR CUSHION] Spigen Google Nexus 5 Case ULTRA HYBRID [Black] [1 FREE Premium Japanese Screen Protector + 2 FREE Graphics] Anti-Scratch Bumper Case with Clear Back Panel for Nexus 5 - ECO-Friendly Package - Black (SGP10609), but I'm not entirely happy as the flush buttons make it hard to use one handed as opposed to my RINGKE FUSION for Google Nexus 4 Best Selling Shock Absorption Bumper + Anti Scratch Clear Back Premium Hybrid Case [Eco/DIY Pkg.][BLACK].Personally, I do love Android. I can simply turn my phone on, look at my lock screen at the Dashclock Widget and see how many texts I have, emails, weather notifications Facebook notifications and so on without having to unlock my phone. I can also turn on GPS, silence my phone, the flash light on and other functions from my lock screen too. The Nexus 5 gives me a great affordable option.(8) Conclusion:The Nexus 5 has some drawbacks, adequate camera, no MicroSD slot, no removable battery and lacking some of Verizon's LTE bands. It does provide a blazing fast processor, roaring graphics chip, an extremely stock version of Android, thin and light design for a very affordable unlocked price. And it's Sprint capable. Android does take some time to learn, but it offers nearly complete customization. For $349 and a dose of willingness to learn, you can't go wrong here.TLDR: Blazing fast smartphone, okay camera, no bloatware, no Verizon, unlocked and just $349~399.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "All that and a bag of KitKats!", "Author": "Yoshi Ex \"C Ex\"", "ReviewID": "R32ODQ3TXPKK4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me first state that my wife recently go the LG G2 which is a fantastic phone; fast, sharp looking screen, etc..  So this is the standard I'm working on.  I got my Nexus 5 and there was zero disappointment.  The Nexus 5 is equally fast and sharp as the G2, in fact, they both share the Qualcom 800 processor which is a real beast.  Using this phone feels like you've got some serious muscle under the hood and it's absolutely true.Nexus 5 comes with stock android so it doesn't have the bells and whistles of many overlaid software that comes standard on your Samsung S4, Lg G2, HTC One, etc.., however, it also lacks all of the unwanted bloatware and you're fully able to build up from stock android to get the perfect amount of software.  For myself, I prefer the look and feel of stock android and so I've been buying Android stock phones since the G1.The phone is very light in my hands but doesn't feel cheap; it feels quite sturdy and the plastic has a nice grip.  Although, I did get it into the SPIGEN Google Nexus 5 Case Slim [Slim Armor] [Champagne Gold] Air Cushioned Protective Case with Dual Layer for Nexus 5 - Champagne Gold (SGP10566) right away (which is a great case btw).The Kit Kat improvements were expected and I'm equally impressed by;  Google Now is the furthest screen on the left, the icons have a new look; you can now activate \"google search\" by simply saying \"Hey Google\".  This \"Hey Google\" so far gets triggered by my voice as well as others so hopefully I can figure a way for it to listen only to me but that can be dealt with later.Out of the box, the phone only has a couple of home screens available but a quick tip to add more is simply grab an icon and drag it to the upper most right corner of the screen and drop it; that will create a new home screen for you.The only slight annoyance I can provide, at this point, is the ear speaker at the top of the phone; it's white (look at the photo) and so when the phone is off and sitting there I see this white dot which tricks me momentarily into thinking it's an indicator LED saying I have a message or email, etc...  I'm sure I'll get used to this but it's the only thing close to a complaint I can give you at this point.Overall, this is a great purchase and if you're a fan of high end android phones, this won't disappoint you.  I bought mine from Google so paid, with tax, about $423 for the white 32GB model.----------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE *11/8/13So I just learned I'm supposed to be saying \"OK GOOGLE\" not \"HEY GOOGLE\" but they both work.  After several days of use, my only complaint is that the stereo jack is now located back on TOP of the device.  My GNEX had it on the bottom which I preferred.  The phone is still great and performance is stunning.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "carlos jesus", "ReviewID": "R28R0ML3EK98G4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really great smartphone, fast, nice and powerful, I'd wish it has micro SD card slot but 32GB aren't bad at all.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone ever!", "Author": "S.

Its as beautiful as black iPhone 5S and Kitkat OS is on par (actually better) with iOS. You can say its bigger iPhone (I mean it) because Android OS is more flexible, customizable and powerful and it is bigger than in size like its big brother. The bigger size definitely helps in games and all kind of media consumption.This device performance is buttery smooth and the overall experience inspires utmost satisfaction. Given its size it feels so light and slim even compared to iPhone 5/5s.It is not even best nexus device so far but best out yet among all.And now I will explain it.--------------------------1. Design, look and build quality-> I differ here from most reviewers who says its plain or boring and nothing stands out of this. Its as good looking as black (space gray) iPhone 5S. Its all black like iPhone 5s. Though its made of plastic its feels sturdy, well built with precision only known to Apple. And for the people who tell iPhone made of aluminum, Nexus 5 sides appears no inferior to iPhone 5S black sides. The front glass is very well fused with the body with almost no gaps. Now what we are left with? Back? The back of Nexus 5 is though made of plastic it feels very good in the hand and due to its matte finish does not seem to slip off.Now one step further...iPhone 5S black (or space gray) seems to have identity crisis of being black or something else, Nexus 5 black is perfectly black and it has got radically different sides (not plain round rectangle which all other smartphones have). The sides are beautifully something else.iPhone 5S beauty is revealing and Nexus 5 beauty being black is mysterious and never gets boring.I love this black beauty and don't blame for my taste as they said \"beauty lies in the eyes of beholders\".\"Simplicity is Beauty and Beauty is simplicity, nothing more, nothing less.\" - Oscar Wilde. If any phone on the market lives up to the Oscar Wilde's quote its Nexus 5.In short its unapologetically simple\".2. Processor/speed-> Buttery/silky smooth. Neck to neck with iPhone 5s and second only to Note 3 for all practical purposes.3. Screen/display-> Awesome. Its better than retina any time as its full HD. The feeling of display being washed up goes away very soon and remember the so called best retina have the same problem as they share the same display technology.4. Ecosystem-> Android eco system is as good as Apple's. In fact I find it better because of Android OS power you have kind of powerful applications which Apple fan boys can never have. Apple fan boys just give a try to 'tasker' (Warning: Only if you can handle Android's raw power.)5. Powerful Soul-> \"Fools are those who don't want their souls to be powerful.\" Its as good as iOS but better why? because its powerful and customizable. You can do the things with it when you need. Its no way comparable to inferior iOS. Apple fan boys! People should not be proud of a system which does not even let them change default for anything.6. Call Quality -> Fantastic. I have never had so clear voice on call for very long.7. Network Signal Quality -> Fantastic.8. Volume/Speaker-> Inherently the speaker is very loud. Though in some application it might sound a little short of enough but its software related problem and should be fixed in future update. I have tested the volume in many application like play and in some apps are freaking load. While playing music through play I had to cut down on the volume in car its so powerful.With headphones its fantastic. The voice quality is very superior and has no noise in it. Its as pure as it gets.9. Camera-> I have seen all the comparisons of Nexus 5 with all leading phones (HTC one, Nokia Lumia, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4) and its competing neck to neck in every department except its little slow to focus. But once it focus it takes very good images. HDR+ beats all other phones (I swear it). But again Google admitted it was software related issue and would be fixed soon through update. Personally I am pretty satisfied with the camera.Its at least best nexus phone camera and comparable to others except in little slower to focus. The photos are very detailed with accurate colors.Note: I have uploaded some photos for reference.10. Battery-> No complaints. Nothing great or bad here. Its definitely better than many old phones (including galaxy nexus) and equal to many others.It just falls short of only two smart phones right now which are LG G2 and Note 3. But it's battery is comparable to the best smartphone i.e. iPhone 5s. So if iPhone 5S can be the best with that kind of battery I don't understand how we could complain of Nexus 5. For casual usage you will charging it once a day. The noticeable thing is that in idle mode it does not eat battery at all and that's where it will average out better end of the day.11. Reparability-> iFixit has given its 8 of 10 in this department and you should feel comfortable saving your money on costly repair by doing many things yourself and the whole assembly is modular.Summary-> Even keeping its lower price aside, Its the one of best smart phone and should equal or better any best smart phone on the planet right now. And you add advantage of lower price...", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone but battery life could be an issue for some users", "Author": "Bubba", "ReviewID": "R3VV7JE4ZJAXVS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "All the prior reviews are accurate, but I thought it was important to add another perspective from a hands-on user.  I have been a google nexus user for several generations of the devices, enjoying the unlocked phone on T-mobile monthly plans at far less costs than AT&T.;  I usually upgrade my nexus phone and pass the older generation to my spouse who doesn't seem to care about the tech specs.  I patiently waited for the release of the Nexus 5, and entered my order within the first hour, receiving the device from google play in early November.  After putting the phone through several days usage, which included minimal talk time (less than 10 min per day), about 10 texts per day, and 5 emails, I was surprised and disappointed to find battery life around 10% at 8pm at night.  If I was to have an active day or busy evening, I would be scrambling to get a quick charge to make it through the entire day.  My prior Nexus phones have seen much better battery life, and I spent a couple of days getting tips from the web to adjust settings to reduce battery drain, but to no significant result.  Perhaps I just had a faulty device.  Nevertheless, I returned my Nexus 5 and did not buy another yet.

Main concern, no microSD card slot. Sound volume is low even at highest setting. This becomes a concern when driving in highways. I have to use a powerful bluetooth speaker. Otherwise this is a great device. I knew the limitations, still bought one. Look at my video review of Nexus 5 Black phone.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don't advertize or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version): 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5\" is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, but after using Note for a while, I don't use it as a primary phone. The display in Nexus 5 is absolutely stunning with a Super AMOLED display and you have to see to feel it! I like it as much as Galaxy S4 and S5.ANDROID UI:Nexus 5 has Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. User Interface has a flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently to my friends shows the details of processes. battery usage like which process takes up more battery and it is geeky and impressive.CAMERA:This can just replace a point and shoot camera. Wait, what is a point and shoot camera?! Very impressive. I use it sometimes, but my Nikon D90 still the workhorse.PROCESSING POWER:Don't bother about it. For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.Qi WIRELESS CHARGING:BIG PLUS on Nexus 5 phones. Very convenient. Period.NFC Tags:Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. Get bunch ( I mean around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example in my S4, when I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both.Micro SD card!!BIG BUMMER. I am so used to SD card and having tons to stuff. I am feling the pain.OTG - USB Hosts:This is also often ignored feature in many reviews. On the GO USB cable + Nexus 5 means you can use with external hard disks, and virtually many of USB devices. If you have a thumb drive and have files, you can in fact read with a phone and don't necessarily have to open a laptop. works out of the box.BATTERY:Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don't. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!MISC FEATURES:GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Look at my video review.To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), TOM TOM, , Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Currents (nice way to read News), Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they have for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google VoiceAsk questions.

Three days later, I accidentally dropped the phone from only two feet high on flat plastic tile (it fell off fron my y-sherts poket when I pick up somting) but the screen glass shattered. I called google to explain them, the google representative transfer phone to LG company. They charged $170 to replace the screen which is half of new phone price.I received the phone two weeks later. The phone is not receiving signal from T-mobile sometimes received one or two bar of low signal but that was E or H signal which is very slow, not even 3G, 4G nor LTE. I did not get any signals indoor at all. I called LG service again to explain, they told me to return the phone again to their service center with provided return label which was not overnight service it was Fedex ground service. I have to wait another two weeks to received my cellphone back.Two weeks later I received phone back from LG but it was same condition. I seems they did not even looked at it. it did not received any strong or fast signal from t-mobile. I called LG again, they told me same thing like two weeks ago. \"Send it back to LG\".I bought nexus5 I used it for three days, I could not used my phone for more than a month now.

(so far)", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R101D5O61AOKWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"Best phone I have ever owned\" is a big claim, especially since I recently also owned a brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (with companion Galaxy Gear smartwatch). So let me elaborate...My previous phone (not counting the Note 3) was a Nexus S, one of Google's earlier and not-very-widely-adopted phones. Although made by Samsung, it was a pure Google Android phone with none of the bloat-ware associated with some manufacturers. And with none of the multiple account sign-ups (Google Account + Samsung Hub + ???). I did like the pure Adnroid experience then, and I like it now on the new Nexus 5.Although I missed out on the Nexus 4, two family members each picked up one of those popular phones when Google slashed the price prior to launching the Nexus 5. While those we're outstandingly good value purchases, I'm glad I waited for the Nexus 5 myself.The Nexus 5 is slim and stylish in a very understated way, like a little black dress (but I'm not a girl). Out goes the bling, and in comes a slightly rubberised back which is way nicer than it sounds... and reassuring to hold. The screen is a pleasure to look at, because you can't see the individual pixels, and it's big enough without being a \"phablet\". It's fast and responsive, 4G-ready, the latest Android 4.4 KitKat, and very good value for the price I paid \"in store\" soon after launch (hence not a verified purchase here on Amazon). Documentation is scarce, so you may have to do a lot of experimenting or reading around on the web, but there is always The (Unofficial) Google Nexus 5 SmartPhone Book : The missing manual for LG's Android 4.4 KitKat phone.It really is no exaggeration for me to say that I have been telling all my friends that \"this is the best phone I have ever owned\". And I'm pretty fickle.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nexus the best tablet. Nexus 5 the best phone. Nexus so Smart. Nexus beautiful devices. Such a stunning phone", "Author": "Barb\u0113l\u014d", "ReviewID": "RQ9PEJTQ7UMJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the Nexus 10. Nexus 7. Now the lovely Nexus 5. They are all so smart devices, so quick and, even the Nexus 10, so compact and slim. Put them all side-to-side each other, and they do look good. I have waited years to get devices like these and, even tho I have also got the iPads, I can honestly say these Nexus devices are the best I have ever seen...I'm really impressed with all of them.I had an old Ericsson phone, it must be, almost 10 years now and thought it was time to replace it for a smartphone.But I wasn't too keen on the iPhone, my sons got the iPhone 5, because how small they are. But when I saw Google was bringing the Nexus 4 out, I decided to get that but I never did. I'm glad now that I waited for them to bring the Nexus 5 out, becaz I understand its slimmer and a lot more compact, also the camera is better than the previous model. Comparing this Nexus5 to the iPhone5 it is a Fabolous size and I always knew the iPod 4 was small, but having the Nexus5, iv realised just how small it is so now I will only be using the iPod for media only.This is the best phone I have owned, it's even easier to use than my land-line phone....I'm not technical at all.The dial pad is terrific and so simple to use,and the volume is crystal clear. I love the fact that the speakers are on the bottom of the phone near to the loudspeaker and micAlso, becaz iv never used a smart phone before, I'm amazed just how quick it charges and if you compare it to ordinary mobile phones that aren't Smart, I'm extremely impressed with the battery life.The camera is amazing, I have never seen a camera so precise and the pictures come out so clear and sharp, it's just as tho you are seeing the real object and not seeing it through a lens. Front and back camera I found really good, but for obvious reasons the back camera is a lot more sharper, giving a cleaner photo all round.I haven't text on the phone yet......Google sent me this earlier to show me how to do texting - SMS - 'HANGOUTS'[...]I wanted an emoji keyboard for the Nexus and this is itiPhone Emoji Keyboard support slideI just love using these emoji symbols. I actually got this one from GooglePlayStore for my Nexus5 phone and it works fab. You just 'default' the emoji keyboard and then it works in the exact same way as on the iPads. Use it when writing Emails - typing on-line - SMS. It is so much fun to use., and it's brilliant that you can have the Emoji for Android, not just for iOS devices.Went on the net earlier and just like the other two devices, it's so quick. Browsing and Emails, I couldn't ask for a faster smart-phone...it's so genius, clever.Also, I have played a couple of my games that I got from GooglePlay, played 'Tilt 3d Labyrinth' where you have got to get the marbles across the board by 'tilting' your device and make sure they dnt drop down the holes.So touch friendly -it honestly felt like I was playing my nexus 7 or 10, obviously apart from the size difference, I'm still amazed that it was a phone that I'm using.When I got the phone from GooglePlay, I should have asked them about the sim becaz unfortunately I didn't realise it was a Micro-Sim, so I had to wait a few days for my Mobile Operator to send one. But at least I was able to still use it as a small tablet whilst waiting for the Sim to arrive.I downloaded the Amazon AppStore onto my Nexus, which I can't understand as it says iv got the max amount of devices - 10.- and I have only got 3 devices, I dnt even think I downloaded the AppStore onto the 7...so it might just be just the two devices, so where's the others come from??Edit: 1st Dec -When I rang Amazon to enquire this, we eventually realised its everytime Android OS gets updated the PlayStore looks at it as a new device. Unfortunately there's nothing that can be done to resolve this issue apart from the customer deleting older versions of the OS ourselfs within 'Apps and Devices' - 'Devices'. I find this annoying, but at least we know now what the problem is.I also downloaded the Amazon Music Player and, even tho I haven't downloaded any music onto the device it self yet, playing the music from the cloud was really clear.I will add more into this review, but I have only just started using it...but overall I'm extremely impressed with my new phone - Tablet.Also, one reviewer I have noticed has given this amazing device such an appalling review just becaz there's no 'paper' instructions.We are 'trying' to be Planet Friendly and so the best way is to reduce the amount of paper that's used. All the instructions can be found via the internet, just Google Nexus 5 or phone Google themselves as they have a dedicated help-line. But, like I have said I'm not technical at all, so if I have no problems anyone can work this device out and that's not even getting advice. It's so simple to use.I have just received an Email regarding instructions on how to get started with the Nexus 5, including some really useful tips also[...](I also need to add that I'm reviewing the Nexus device and not the seller, as I always buy directly from the Manufacture whenever possible).", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "My favorite phone", "Author": "Morphling", "ReviewID": "RMMZMKYKLFXD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nexus 5 is the best Nexus yet and one of the best phones at that. I've had mine for approximately a week and couldn't be happier. I got the white one and think it looks fantastic. With that note, let's get into a review and we'll start on build quality:The build - the phone is solidly built and light too - I personally like a heaver phone being a man with larger hands. So, if you like lighter phones and find others too bulky, this may be refreshing for you. Some professional reviews state the phone is good or mediocre build at best which is patently false. Yes, there's a seam on this phone, especially owning a white version but it isn't some huge gap that's ugly or a place where you can push the two pieces together more. The phone has no creaks at all and the glass is flush on all sides. I mention the glass because I've owned Motorola, HTC, and even iPhones where the glass at the edge isn't even across the whole device and it drives me nuts. The new buttons are ceramic - ohhh! They are nice and work well. The sim card tray is next to the power button but I haven't noticed it at all searching for the button as it's very flush with the phone. There isn't an SD card slot on this phone - get over it. 32GB is enough for MOST users. If you are truly a power user who needs to swap out 64GB cards frequently for whatever reasons (I know some of you do exist) this isn't the phone for you. I'm sorry, the Nexus devices haven't had one in a long time and it's a cost saving measure too.Next is connectivity and calling - the main point of a phone, right? I won't discuss specific networks as that opens up a whole different debate that entire forums can't solve! LTE works screaming fast on the phone and it holds onto the signal well. HSPA+ is a beast on this phone too if your area doesn't have it. Calls connect well and nothing has dropped so far. The call quality is decent, which is a bummer as I'm one who still talks a lot on their phone. I haven't tried any HD voice features yet so that may help the issue. Wifi works well on the phone too both with 5ghz and 2.4ghz - my older router doesn't have all the latest standards but the phone supports any wifi you'll encounter. I'll point out that my house is an old one with huge blocks that love to cancel out any cell signals. This phone holds onto them and keeps them unlike other phones I've used on the same network.Screen - The best I've used. I have grown tired of the Samsung AMOLED screens and favor the route Apple and HTC and now LG have taken, for the most part. It's super crystal clear and even being a near-sighted blind person, I can't pick out pixels for the first time. Colors are pretty accurate and everything is great looking. The touch portion of the screen is great too with no issues. It works as well as any other top tier phone. Now 'for the most part' means I do notice this screen, as any LCD, cannot do true black unlike AMOLED. It's a feature left to that technology alone but it doesn't detract here as the screen is great and you don't notice unless you have a competing phone next to it.Battery - It's average on this phone. It isn't a beast like I've had on some Moto phones but it isn't a junker like some Samsung devices I've used too. After the first couple days, it evened out and with moderate use I can make it to 10pm bed-time. It isn't going to blow you away but it isn't the worst out there either. I'd have liked an option to use a removable battery as I don't mind a heavier device or battery - but clearly we are going to wafer light and thin devices.Camera - It's a good camera to me and leaps and bounds better than any past phone I've owned including other Nexus devices. Pictures come out clear and the HDR+ feature is pretty good as well. Pictures come out sharper and it even works well trying to take a picture of my moving baby. I can still tell it was taken with a phone vs. a stand-alone camera, but it's way more sufficient for my wants than I need. The wife takes the serious pictures, I just take pictures of things to make sure I bought the right item. So, if you aren't a budding photographer, this thing works well and even captures moving people well enough.Software - The new KitKat 4.4 is here and overall I love it more than the last version, just like I do with every android release. I won't give a comprehensive review of the OS here, but I'll touch on some things. Google added some developer options on this phone that you can enable as an option that make it scream. It moves faster than I can use it now and this is a great step for any phone OS. I've used Windows Phone 8 and many flavors of iOS and many versions of Android. This is by far my favorite OS now, hands down. MS has done well with 8, but this blows that out of the water now. iOS 7 has veered off to me and I personally don't like it. Anyway, this thing is fast! Google now is better than ever, but I had to turn it off as it sucked battery down. I hope Google addresses this as the service is awesome. Hangouts is cool that everything is in one spot, but it's clunky to use for SMS and everything. I wish google would have waited until everything in hangouts was totally done before merging, but they at least give you the option to download another SMS program and set it as the default now. You have got to love choices. Default email is better now and Gmail and calendar are excellent as ever. Overall it's a pleasant step forward and hardly anything I don't like.That's a basic review of the phone and I'll end with the overall value and point of the phone. Here on this great online retailer, the phone appears to cost more. You can easily go to the source, if available in your country, and purchase it for an incredibly great price. It is completely unlocked so you don't have to fiddle with buying an unlock code, which in the USA is now shady anyway, and waste more time and money. This phone also will get updates quickly without hassles or being left in the dust instantly. It's also priced at a mid-tier value, for almost all top tier specs and experiences. I think many pro-reviewers have worried that things like the camera or battery aren't toe to toe with other phones, but those do cost more. The bigger issue they miss is Android on this phone is unlike it on any other phone. That's worth something too and what I stress is the most important thing about this phone.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "32GB White Nexus 5", "Author": "J.
