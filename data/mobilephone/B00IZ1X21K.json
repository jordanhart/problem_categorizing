{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Samsung Evolution", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R3UULR1IWEUS4I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs. With that out of the way, let's get to the point and the nitty gritty, shall we?* THE SCREEN - that is the very first thing you will notice when you look at the S5. Samsung has found its niche with AMOLED screens, which are BRIGHT & SATURATED. Everything almost literally jumps out at you, and sometimes even too much so. I had to switch to the \"natural\" setting, as the \"vivid\" and even \"standard\" profiles are too saturated(and FAKE) for me. It's better as a demo unit to draw you in, but for everyday use, I recommend switching to the natural profile.FACTS: The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Full HD resolution - 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~432 ppi pixel density, plus Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the screen from scratches.* The Look - the S5 has a more squared-off edges look than the S4, which is more squared off than the S3, but all three are not as angular as the S2. In terms of roundness-to square-ness, it goes from the S3 - S4 - S5 - S2 (the original S just looks like an iPhone 3GS). Check out my images for an easier comparison. The S5 is the tallest and widest, but not the thickest of the Galaxy S's. The best thing I can say about this is it's an evolution. Beauty is subjective, so judge for yourself. The front side is almost the same as any other Galaxy phone: You have the physical Home button, flanked by the \"back\" and \"menu\" capacitive buttons. Probably the most improved aspect of the design is in its functionality - it is now dust-proof, and water-proof up to 3 feet!FACTS: The dimensions are 5.59\" x 2.85\" x 0.32\"(142cm x 72.5cm x 8.1cm), and weighs 5.11oz(145g).* The Feel - Samsung has taken a lot of flack for making the Galaxy S line so cheap looking and feeling with its plastic bodies, for being the top Android phone maker. HTC has been known to have the best craftsmanship with their all-metal One phones. Perhaps Samsung feel they are so dominant that they don't have to spend more to mass-produce metal phones, but since they don't want to come off as too arrogant, so their compromise is a dimpled, faux-rubber backside like the Nexus 7(2012) and its very own Galaxy Note 3. It definitely gives a better feel - it doesn't slip and slide in your hands or pockets anymore - but it cannot compare to the feel and craftsmanship of the HTC One(both the m7 and m8). It is on the right track though, so let's hope that rumored luxury \"F\" line or next year's S6 will continue to get better.* How it Runs - This phone is fast, fast, FAST! With a 2.5gHz Snapdragon 801, it has the fastest processor out there right now. It terms of real speed, I cannot say if it is faster than the HTC One m8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it is definitely up there. When you touch an app icon to launch it, it launches nearly instantly. To really see how this phone flies, just open the gallery app and scroll through all your photos and you'll see what I mean. Usually the gallery is where most phones stutter as it tries to load all your photos and albums - but NOT the S5!* The Camera - FINALLY! Samsung has decided to make a decent camera, and not just as an afterthought. This 16mp camera is really awesome, so much better than the S4. I would always get washed out images with my S3/S4/Note 2, but with the S5, it actually looks like it's from a decent point-and-shoot dedicated camera with crisp, bright, and saturated images. Low-light shooting is also vastly improved, although not as good as the new HTC One m8. 16mp means 5312 x 2988 -resolution images, so you can actually blow them up or crop them down without fearing the dreaded pixelation monster. There are a myriad of other cool and useful camera features that I will save for you to find out(like macro and \"Google Street View\" modes :]). And lastly, the focus is quick, quick, QUICK! Nearly instantaneous focus allows you to capture those hard-to-capture moments easier. A definitely thumbs up to Samsung for paying attention to the camera and its functions.* Software - I'm still trying to figure out everything, as there is A LOT of stuff under the hood. Samsung's TouchWiz user interface this time around is A LOT less intrusive though, as much as can be without being totally stock Android, I guess. The layout and iconography are flatter and simpler, and for the better in my view. There is also a new sensor on the back, just beneath the camera lens. It is a heart-rate monitor/pedometer, and it comes with its own health app called S Health. There is a new battery-saving mode which can save you precious minutes when you're caught in a bind. All in all, I think this version is a lot nicer-looking, more responsive, and better than the precious S phones.The ultimate question is whether this phone is a worthy upgrade over the S4. As my review title suggests, it is an evolution, an incremental upgrade over the S4. So with that said I cannot whole-heartedly recommend it if you already have a good phone, or even over the S4. But I do feel this upgrade is more vast and much better than from the S3 to the S4, so in that sense Samsung has done a much better job this year. If you are switching from an older phone that was made at least 2 years ago, then I would tell you jump right in and try the S5 - it will not disappoint you. But for those with already a good phone, and/or say you just finished year one of your 2-year contract, then I would say think hard before you make the leap. For my money, I think the Note 4 and S6 will be the bigger upgrades more worth waiting for.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "coming from Galaxy S3", "Author": "sokae", "ReviewID": "R1U3V54KW5BYEF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "#Before i start, I am so glad I waited for S5 to come out instead of getting the S4 since I heard S4 have overheating issue and lag from touchwiz once you have it for a while#Peformance- holy cow!! This phone is rediculously fast as heck! Way faster than my old Galaxy S3 dual core version!. Everying seem to just fly away!#-battery- I can't gauge the battery life since it hasn't been long since I got this phone from the store but am sure it will last longer than my S3.# update 4-15-15# so its been a couple of days since I have S5 and I could give a good idea to how long the battery last on me. It last me the whole day if I were to use it on unlimited data while web browsing, calling, texting and  some gaming and videos/music. I try to charge it fully to 100% and play heavy 3d games nonstop and it last me about 4hrs+. In other words, its definitely last longer than my S3 and my friend S4.#gaming- modern combat 4, NOVA 3, real racing 3, gt racing 2, dead trigger 2, nfs most wanted and others heavy 3d games are running excellent on this phone accept there are some lag here and there and that's due to poor optimization from the Dev.#4g lte- I compare the connective speed to my older bro LG G2 4g lte on T-Mobile and its about the same speed.#screen- the screen on this phone is really nice/crispy clear. Too be expected from the resolution spec.#build quality- its feel really good in the hand compare to my S3 and since i nor none of my family own an s4, I can't compare with it.# update 4-15-15# I got a chance to hold an S4 from a friends and I could say that, the S5 feel more comfortable and grip to hold onto than the S4.#touchwiz- I know some people hate the touchwiz on Samsung phone but I don't really mind as long as I could get things done I need too. To me, the touchwiz is much much better than my S3 and it looks like it doesn't take up too much ram like the S3. It's much faster and fluid with the help of Snapdragon 801 of course and 2gb ram.#camera- yea! No more bringing my camera with me whenever I want to take a pic! The quality of the camera on this phone is amazing! It take reallllyy good pictures!#update 4-15-15# Am loving the camera on this phone so much. There're just so many things to do to edit the picture once you have take!# In conclusion, I am glad I waited to get the S5 rather than the S4. It was worth the long wait! I'll come back and update about couple weeks later.#update- 4-13-15#fingerprints- Its a cool feature and it does work but I find it a bothersome since I could just slide the bar in less than 1 sec while the fingerprint scanner take about 4+ sec but that's just me though.#water proof- I have finally made my decision and decide to put my S5 in a cold/hot water for 1 minutes straight and its still working normal as it is so yea, it's waterproof.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Evolutionary NOT revolutionary!", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R1NWP2IK3TUSVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Oh, Another year, another set of phones from manufacturers!  I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. I will not call Samsung Galaxy S5 as revolutionary, but it is certainly evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. I love Samsung Galaxy S5 from its competitors for few reasons - removable battery, microSD card support and the maturity of the product. I have been using a S5 for past couple of days and have ordered a unlocked one from my local store. There are so many variants already in the market. So do check local specs. For example, in china market dual SIM S5 is available.Galaxy S5's back plate has a perforated dot pattern and a excellent matte finish. As a result, the phone looks far more sophisticated than its past designs despite its plastic build. Its surface feels nice to the touch without being too rough or too slippery.  I really do _not_ care about the plastic, in fact the lightweight nature is what I care. Some people make a huge deal out of it. A high quality plastic is good for lightweight and I go with lightweight than a heavy phone in the pocket. A reputed tech site called recently Samsung as the \u201cundisputed king of the Android smartphone space\u201d. True indeed. With the plethora of devices in tablets/phones, they have iterated so much that they can produce truly stunning products.If you care for weight, the Galaxy S4 is lighter than S5.  (please see my stats below).  In fact pixel density is slightly higher in S4 due to a 0.1in size difference. So get an S4, it is cheaper and still same phone that came out last year. If you care for heart rate monitor, fingerprint scanner, and water proof, get the S5. Otherwise literally similar set and you can save a lot by getting S4 now. Last year when S4 came out it was a great phone. It still is, though S5 came out now. Obsoletion is in the mind of the us, not on the devices.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don\u2019t advertize or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801,  MSM8974-AC  Processor:  Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version):  5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP,  Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU  Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5\u201d is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, but after using Note for a while, I don\u2019t use it as a primary phone.  The display in S5 is absolutely stunning with a Super AMOLED display and you have to see to feel it!ANDROID UI:S5 has Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. User Interface hasa flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently to my friends shows the details of processes. battery usage like which process takes up more battery, Qi charging receivers for wireless charging on Galaxy phones and they were in awe.WATER PROOF:Obviously I have not tested this!,  but a very nice to have feature and gives a peace of mindCAMERA:This can just replace a point and shoot camera. Wait, what is a point and shoot camera?! Very impressive. S5 has a 16MP camera with super-fast autofocus, HDR mode with real-time preview, and support for 4K video recording. Definitely state of the art.  I took several indoor photos and they look great. It will be interesting to see how photos appear in a vanilla S5 which Google will release.S-HEALTH:I rely and use S-Health more than any other app in my Galaxy S5. It has driven my fitness regimen to a very good progress and the design of app is nothing short of buttery and beautiful. I am often too in good favor of Samsung loading the phones with S-Ware, but their design of S-Health is definitely breathtaking. Heart rate monitor is a great addition to the fitness tools. I used it for walking several steps and found it same as in S4.PROCESSING POWER:Don\u2019t bother about it.  For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.Qi WIRELESS CHARGING:I wonder why Samsung does not release wireless charging built in. You have to get a external Qi wireless charger and open the back, align it and use with a Qi charger. It should be integrated, but you can do it after the fact.NFC Tags:Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. Get bunch (  I mean  around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example in my S4, when  I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both. I am programming my S5 also to do host of things.128 GB Micro SD card!!This is just incredible. If you see my reviews, I have been saying having external capacity is very key. With a 4K camcorder you can fill your space in a blink of the eye. Movies take up space. Who would have thought a 128 GB tiny card can fit in  a phone. This is just incredible. I tested with a 128 GB  and it works wonderfully! A 16 GB phone memory will have around 10 GB spare initially.OTG - USB Hosts:This is also often ignored feature in many reviews.  On the GO USB cable + S5 means you can use with external hard disks, and virtually many of USB devices. If you have a thumb drive and have files, you can in fact read with a phone and don\u2019t necessarily have to open  a laptop. works out of the box.BATTERY:Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don\u2019t. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!MISC FEATURES:I tested fingerprint scanner, but I am not sure how reliable it will be over time with scratches/oily fingers etc. I have to test it further, but for now I will settle on traditional passwords till bugs are ironed out.  Apple\u2019s initial fingerprint software had bugs which was fixed subsequently. There are so many other features in S5. Some of them have become so standard that they are not review worthy!  e.g., Infrared for wireless remotes, GPS etc. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up).To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), TOM TOM, , Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Currents (nice way to read News), Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they hve for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google VoiceAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S5. I will be glad to answer any questions within 24 hours.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Returned 7 days after purchase...No Talk & Surf", "Author": "CocoComplexion \"SexyNavy\"", "ReviewID": "R3IMYK3XAVPKG1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My upgrade became available just in time to get the S5. I shopped around for the best deal and pre-ordered it at a local store. I really liked the phone initially. The fingerprint scanner is a great feature. I had no problems with the response or speed of the phone. Still had some network issues with calls but, I'm use to it with Sprint. After all that, I discovered that this phone does not allow you to Talk & Surf at the same time. For the entire week, I was on a call and made several attempts to get on the internet or do something data related and I would get a \"no connection\" error. I thought there must be a setting I was missing, so I tried changing the networks to all that was available (CDMA, LTE/CDMA, GSM, Automatic). Each time, I would make a phone call and try the internet and it never worked. Which means, there's no Facebooking, Instagraming, Hangouts, Google Maps/Search, BBM, Twitter, GroupMe...NOTHING data related while on a call. The only time it works is when the phone is connected to a Wi-Fi zone. This was UNACCEPTABLE for me! Hence, the reason I gave it 2 stars. I upgraded from an S3 to the S5 and never had an issue with surfing the net while on a call on my S3. I Talk & Surf everyday. Apparently, this phone was developed with the new 'Spark LTE' network which does not allow Talk & Surf. You can only do one at a time due to a hardware change in the phone from dual band to single band. If you're in the middle of downloading, uploading, surfing, etc., and a call comes in, the phone will immediately cut off your data and will not resume until you end the call. I Googled this issue and it is legitimate based on Sprint Community Forums. Also, I contacted the local Sprint store and they verified this as well. Therefore, I returned the S5 before my grace period was up and got the Note 3 instead. Now, I can Talk & Surf again!!If Talk & Surf is important to you as it is to me, I suggest that you stick with the S3, S4, or the Notes. Stay away from any phone that says \"Spark LTE\" until Sprint fixes it.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing screen, sweet power sipping mode, IR blaster, great camera, fingerprint secured, and water and dust resistant!", "Author": "Brian Herro", "ReviewID": "RGFHAFCMYNSLQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THE CHARGERPlease note that while the Samsung Galaxy S5 has a special looking port for charging (the new USB 3.0 design) it IS absolutely compatible with existing micro-USB chargers.  You CAN use the old charger from one of your old Android powered devices! Just plug it into the right side of the port, the part that looks like a micro-USB port.  It just happens to charge really really quickly if you use a USB 3.0 cable, but it's not necessary to do so.THE AMAZING SCREENFirst things first, this display is nicer than any I have ever seen.  It is so sharp I cannot see individual pixels with my naked eye.  It's also bright, very bright!  It's perfectly usable on a bright sunny day at noon without a cloud in the sky.  I noted that when switching between the highest setting with and without auto-brightness, the screen actually brightened more with the auto-brightness feature enabled, but only in really bright conditions!  So if it's extremely bright outside, leave the auto-brightness feature enabled, it actually appears to be able to reach a higher brightness that way.  The auto-brightness feature is superbly implemented anyway, so I'd recommend leaving it on regardless.  I upgraded from the S3, and I immediately noticed the whiter whites, darker blacks, extremely realistic and still vibrant colors, and even the capability of dimming the screen much more effectively (which is really nice when using the phone in bed).THE INSANELY AWESOME ULTRA-POWER SAVING MODEThis thing is for real.  With 10 percent power left, you get usability the rest of the day.  The S5 has a super amoled screen, so black pixels don't draw any power as opposed to back-lit LCD screens.  Ultra-power saving mode turns the screen black and white, and gives you a jet-black interface with up to six black and white icons.  It reduces the screen frame rate, shuts down two of the four cores (the phone is a quad core phone), reduces in half the speed of the remaining two cores, shuts down almost all background processes, disables most apps, and sips power all the while letting you text, call, and surf the web.  You can check your email via the web, but can't use the email or gmail apps.  Basically it turns your phone into one of those old flip phones that lasted forever.  That's pretty sweet in a pinch!You know, those moments when you're sitting at the auto-service center, sweating bullets because you're about to embark on the Ramen noodle diet for the remainder of the year?  And on top of that your phone's about to die, and all you want it to do is hang on for another few minutes so you can get the invoice and make this call: \"Honey, it's the flux capacitor.  I guess a device that involves 1.21 gigawatts isn't cheap.  It's gonna be 5 gazillion dollars.  I think we're gonna be eating Ramen noodles for a while.  Can you get one of the chili flavored packs ready for me?  I'll be home in about 20 minutes.  Don't let me forget to cancel the newspaper.  That'll save us a few ... well, dear, I'm pretty sure we need the flux capacitor ... yes, I know ... but college isn't all that important these days anyway; they'll be fine ... Alright, will do.  I love you too.\"  At least with the S5 you don't have to worry about your phone.  It's not gonna die before you get back.Right now my phone is at 91% power.  I just activated ultra-power saving mode, and it says I'd get 11.4 DAYS of standby time.  I figure with regular use I'd get a week.  You could literally charge your phone to 100% before a week-long vacation, flip on ultra power-saving mode, use your phone normally and probably make it the entire week without having to charge it.  I'd love to test that theory.  But suffice it to say that gone are the days of needing to worry about a dead phone when you're out all day and don't have access to a charger.THE SECURITY OF A FINGERPRINT SCANNERIt takes some getting used to, but once you set up your fingerprints, you can easily activate the phone by swiping your finger or thumb (I set mine up for one-handed use using my thumb, and after a week, it registers on the first try just about every time).  No one else can access my phone and should I try and fail to unlock the phone too many times, I can then enter a password to unlock it.  I had to do that a few times the first day of use.  But with frequent use, I quickly learned to unlock my phone on the first attempt.  I am a huge fan of the fingerprint scanner.THE IR BLASTERI can use the IR blaster to operate my TV.  Along with Bluetooth and WiFi, the infrared blaster basically gives you the chance to make your phone a universal remote!  Yes I use it, yes it works, yes it's another awesome feature.WATER AND DUST RESISTANTI love that you could accidentally drop the phone in a puddle or have it fall out of your shirt pocket into the toilet, sink, or bathtub and you'll be just fine.  It's nice that a downpour won't short-circuit your phone, and it's pretty spectacular that if you forgot to take the phone out of your pocket before doing a load of laundry, you'd likely retrieve a perfectly operable phone from the washing machine.  Not sure about dust resistance, I never had a phone die from dust, but I'm guessing it's happened before and it's nice that it won't with this phone.THE CAMERAIt's a behemoth.  It's a 16 megapixel camera that takes beautiful and sharp pictures.  It takes great low-light pics without the need for activating the camera flash.  I used it during my Nephew's baptism recently.  My aunt saw the pictures on my screen as I took them and reviewed them.  After the baptism, she looked at my phone and said, \"Your phone takes such beautiful pictures!  I'd rather have a phone that takes pictures like that than this thing (she was holding up her really nice digital camera)!THE DESIGNIt's functional folks.  The S5 is made of a nice looking textured soft-feeling plastic that I think looks quite premium (although it's panned in almost every official review for being made of plastic).  Mine is white and looks fantastic, but isn't quite as soft as the black variant--which is actually a dark grey rather than black (I chose the white because it looks really good).  Nonetheless the plastic seems more scratch resistant than metal, due to its softness.  It feels nice in the hand and doesn't get hot or cold the way metal gets.  It's nice and grippy too, and that's important.  You don't want to go around dropping a premium phone.  And because it's flexible, the plastic cover pulls right off the back of the phone so you can replace the battery (which isn't really necessary with Ultra-power saving mode--see above), or add some extra storage with MicroSD card slot.THE NEGATIVEThe only negative I've seen is the loudness of the speaker.  It doesn't get all that loud.  Some people complain about the plastic.  For the reasons I mentioned above, I don't.  I prefer the textured plastic to just about anything else.  Others actually complain about the port cover!  To them I say BOO-FREAKING-HOO!  Oh no, a cover that lets your phone survive a tumble through the freaking washing machine!  How truly awful!THE VERDICTUltimately the S5 looks really nice, stays alive forever (as far as modern smart phones go, anyway), can be used as a universal remote, has an incredibly bright and stunningly beautiful display that is readable in the direct light of the sun, has a fantastic camera, has a really convenient and pretty sure proof security system with the fingerprint scanning set up, can survive a tumble through the washing machine as well as lots of dust, and has a plastic design that allows for the immediate and screw-less opening of the device for the swapping of a battery or the addition of a MicroSD card!  Five stars?  Well, since you can't give 4.9 stars (minus 0.1 for the speaker), yep!", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "From S3 to S5", "Author": "R. B. Ray \"Rus Ray\"", "ReviewID": "R16ORBWIG6RCDF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Samsumg Galaxy S3 when it first came out. Due to an unlimited data contract, I had opted to continue on through the S4 and just now decided to lose my unlimited data by upgrading to the S5. I must say, losing unlimited data is absolutely worth it.LikesThe remote control feature. I have a horrendous habit of leaving my TV remote across the room. The IR sensor makes changing the channel possible with my phone. It also linked up to my cable provider to show me what is playing, and changes my TV to that particular channel. Gimmicky? Maybe, but I love it.Fingerprint security - very fast. Not as good as iPhone 5S, but still very viable as a means of security. Hopefully will be opened up to other apps and services, such as Google. A lot of people complain that you must be very accurate while moving your finger across the sensor. I have moved my thumb straight up and down as well as tilted 90 degrees and successfully unlocked my phone. In fact, the only angle I haven\u2019t been able to unlock my phone is by having my thumb oriented upside down.Battery - I haven't had the opportunity to extensively test the battery life yet. However, worth ultra power saving mode on (turns off non essential apps and makes the screen greyscale) the phone reports 10 days of battery life with an 84% charge.IP67 - No dust, no water! I love feeling a little more safe around water. Although the charge port cover is quite annoyingly in the way when it's open.Camera is one of the best I\u2019ve ever used on a smartphone. Clear, crisp pictures and a FAR more intuitive UI than I experienced on the Galaxy S3. The only complaint I have is that it takes a few seconds for the camera to start, which makes it hard to catch impromptu moments!Fantastic call quality.Beautiful screen. 5.1in full HD Super AMOLEDDislikesThe capacitive button to the left of the physical button no longer handles settings/menu. Now it\u2019s your multitasking button. My S3 handled multitasking by long pressing the physical button. It\u2019s a small dislike, and something I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get used to. But I don\u2019t like it for now.Verizon has disabled the use of the download booster mode which allows 4G and Wifi to act together to enable faster downloads.Bloatware. This is becoming a staple with smartphones, and you can disable almost all bloatware in Android. It does still annoy me!No Lockscreen Widgets. At the time of this writing, it is impossible to add lockscreen widgets. Also, if you customize the current lockscreen, you lose the ability to have fingerprint security.The FenceStill plastic+Makes the phone lighter-Feels more prone to breakHeart-rate Monitor-Gimicky. I don\u2019t think it will see a lot of use, but only time will tell.Overall: It's a great phone with some very minor issues. If you're upgrading from the S4, I'd skip it, but anything older, and you should absolutely get in on it!", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Smaller changes, but great overall phone", "Author": "Tsuki", "ReviewID": "R3B2YWEMSVCEI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's keep this straightforward and simple:Pros:- Fingerprint sensor works well. While the instructions say to swipe straight downwards, it is actually possible to register your fingerprint at an angle. Do it correctly, and unlocking it one-handed becomes easy. Here's someone who made a video of this: [...]- After a full day of super intense use, the battery is usually left at around 25-35%. This is far better than previous phones I've had.- The camera is excellent in daylight, decent in low-light situations. However, the daytime photos are stunningly good, gorgeous even.- plastic is grippy in hand, looks better in person than in pictures.- used in rain for a solid 30 minutes, the phone received a thorough soaking and still worked perfectly. water resistant claims hold true. Do note, though, that you must have the back cover on properly so that it can create a waterproof seal.- S health is useful if you make use of it. It can track interesting metrics such as the amount of calories you burn in a day, and the amount you walk around in your daily routine. However, the phone does occasionally get inaccurate readings. A vast majority of the time, though, it works fine.- swappable battery is HUGE. You know how your battery gets worn down over a two year contract, and by the time your contract is up, your battery life sucks so you need to replace your ENTIRE phone? Well, you can just replace the battery with a brand new one, and BAM, battery life back to as if it was new.- TV remote is cool and can be useful- Ultra-power saving mode, when on, can extend battery life to (claimed by Samsung) 10 or so full days. Let me repeat: 10 FULL days. I've tested it for one day, and the entire day killed only about 8-10% battery. Do the math and, well, it seems to fit.- One-handed operation can be done, and Samsung has created a few neat tricks to operate one-handed. Use one-handed modes when you need it, enjoy the larger (and gorgeous) screen when you don't need to use it one-handed.- AMOLED Screen for the S5, according to Displaymate's tests, is the BEST ever made. Anandtech also claims that the screen is pretty much superior in nearly every aspect to it's LCD counterparts. But you should see it for yourself, it is absolutely gorgeous and works well in full daylight conditions.- USB 3.0 port is BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE with your older chargers. You just need to plug in your older chargers into the right side of the port at the bottom. USB 3.0 port also means that, with the proper charger, it charges faster than any other phone on the market. Also, you can get usb 3.0 speeds for transfers, which can be anywhere from 2x-5x faster than usb 2.0 speeds (note, usb 3.0 only works with Windows at the moment).- MicroSD supports up to 128gb. I don't think anything else needs to be said.- Android is less restrictive than IOS, but they're both still good operating systems. Choose the one that fits you best.Cons:- speaker could be improved- camera, while amazing, does have some gimmicky features that can be ignored- USB 3.0 is cool, but bottom flap to cover it is not cool. I'd say look into getting a wireless charger ASAP, so you don't have to worry about the stupid flap. To be fair, though, the flap is needed for the IP67 water and dust resistance that the S5 has.- Touchwiz can be a pain sometimes, but for the most part, it doesn't detract from the overall experienceLook up \"Ultimate Samsung Galaxy S5 Water Test\" on Youtube if you want to see the Galaxy S5 survive through both a 1m deep swimming pool, and a full cycle in a washing machine.Will update as I use the phone more.Edit:Pro - You could actually use a pencil/pen with the phone, as long as you enable high-screen-sensitivity in the settings. With a screen protector on the phone, I can now write/draw stuff fairly accurately. There's no palm rejection like the Note 3, but it's still a nice option to have when needed.Pro - phone notification window, where you can minimize incoming calls into a little facebook-chat-like-bubble, and continue using your phone while chatting with whomever. It's pretty neat, you have to enable it in the \"Call\" menu in the settings.Con - when the speaker is on really loud, you could physically feel the back of the phone vibrate. It's rather uncomfortable and unsettling, get a case ASAP.Con - Wireless charging does not come default with the phone. It costs $30 for a replacement wireless charging back, and it isn't even available to buy yet! Samsung, come on.Edit 2:While the S5 is advertised to be water resistant, DON'T do anything crazy like run your phone under running water. It is still a $600 piece of electronics, so needlessly risking that is not the best idea. Also, running one under a faucet is especially bad; running water equates to pressurized water, something the s5 was NOT tested to handle. Don't risk it. Just know that the water resistance is a good fallback, but don't rely on it. If you want water resistance that's reliable, get a Sony phone (they don't have removable backs, so no water leak risk).", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "EXTREME REVIEWS: GALAXY S5 ROCKS!", "Author": "LucentNargacuga", "ReviewID": "R282CCHM4CK1Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awful pun, I know, but let's move on!The Galaxy S5 is a PINNACLE of true engineering and probably the best phone you can get on the market right now.

I really wanted Swype and to have a bigger screen and faster processing. I am by no means a techie, just someone that uses her phone for everything and wanted a change. I am writing this review for laymen like me.The Galaxy S5 does not disappoint.Pros: This phone is great. The camera blows iPhone's away. It's fast and I can have several apps open at the same time and it doesn't slow it down. The colors are so vivid and websites, photos, and games are crisp. I love the apps that I've found, including an app called Optimize that allows the user to maximize their battery life with a click of a button. I watch videos and read books on this phone and the screen is the perfect size. It's also not too bulky, as the phone itself is pretty slender. Another big difference are the widgets, which give you easy access to your favorite apps, and the ease with which the phone syncs with my Google calendar. I also love the Google Now feature, which can be accessed by holding down the center button and gives you a rundown of your day, scores from the game, recommendations based off your recently viewed, websites. I have had this phone a month and am still discovering things about it.Cons: The battery does drain pretty quickly, if you are using it all day like I am. But on the upside, there is an easy way to switch your phone to power saving mode (I've done that and had it last a day and a half with no charge). There are a lot of apps that come with the phone, many of which are similar to one another. My biggest gripe is that the charger on this model is different than the Galaxy S4 and most other models, so I recommended buying an additional charger or cord now. Finally, there was a pretty big learning curve, so just prepare to be frustrated at first.

Let me suggest something for the next update from each of these parties:  Please include the ability to enable/disable all of your \"cool\" ideas.  (And do not tell your boss that you do when you only do some.)For example, Samsung recently shuffled the set of software features between S4 and S5.  Some good idea such as lock screen apps disappeared with other not so good things such as trial subscriptions were added.  The core problem is that Samsung removes the original ability within Google Android to selectively disable (turn off) apps.  It is great that Samsung tries to filter forward a set of interesting apps;  Please allow me to disable or enable those apps that you filter forward.For example, Sprint (Softbank) continues to press in app purchase of subscription for voicemail to text conversion. The nagware in Sprint voicemail has no option to disable the nagging even though they think they have some basic options.  Sprint has outsourced voicemail as a profit center.  It is truly pressing boundaries for Sprint to insert advertisements in voicemail.  Please allow me to turn off the nagware.  How many times does one have to opt out?Let's encourage them to get a firmware update that benefits we their paying consumers so we can turn off the in app purchases and advertisements.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "The volume isn't loud enough!!", "Author": "roaeja \"Hey you!\"", "ReviewID": "R3O0CFMTAZ6Z91", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Compared to my Samsung Note II, it blows the S5 out of the water.

This will affect your bottom line. YOU CAN'T USE YOUR OTHER CHARGERS TO CHARGE THIS PHONE. What I liked about Android was their consciousness that the buyer is not made of money.

I had the S3 for several years and was very happy with it.1) The day after I received my phone, I stopped receiving text messages completely.  I worked with the T-mobile rep to rectify it.  I had to do a hard reset on the phone.  Although I never received my missed texts, it seemed to work after that.  I was told that the phones were shipped with faulty software that Samsung was aware of.  Texts have worked fine since them.2) The speakerphone is a half-duplex instead of full duplex.  That means that when the other person was talking or making noise on their end, they could never hear me.  I was never sure if they were hearing what i was saying or if it was actually going through.  For example, if I was talking to someone on speakerphone who was in their car and had a lot of noise on their end, they would never hear me.  As someone who uses speakerphone a lot, this is a major problem.  My Samsung S3 was full duplex.  I never had this problem.3) My email never properly synced with my server.  If i looked at emails on my computer, they would still show as unread on my phone even AFTER I hit the sync button.  I would delete emails on my phone and after I synced, they would re-appear.4) I would choose a specific ringtone for different friends and it would only work SOMETIMES.  One time I might get the ringtone that I specified and another time I might get my generic ringtone.  No rhyme or reason.5) Because I live in NYC, some subway stations have cell service and others do not.  If I sent a text when I didn't have service, it SHOULD simply send when I got above ground or to a station that had service.  It wouldn't.  The text would just sit there and never send.  I would have to copy/paste it to a NEW text and send again.6) I used the map service to find a friend who was several blocks away.  I had an address and when I put it into the phone, it sent me in the complete wrong direction.  In fact, the map started spinning as if it had no idea how to locate where I was or where I was going.7) There was a serious lag because of Touchwiz.  It's almost as if the phone is thinking about what it needs to do.I'm being shipped a new phone but I'm not sure if it will fix ANY of these problems. If it doesn't, I'm going to have to choose a new one.
