{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The perfect phone for a 9 year old", "Author": "lisa page", "ReviewID": "R1L9FHYRTNHSIH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I bought this for our 9 year old who was begging for a cell phone. I researched and found this on Amazon.  It is the perfect first phone for the elementary school age group. We live in a small culdesac so we let him and his 6 year old brother visit and run around and play with their friends. We always know where they are because we use the cell phone to keep track of him. When it is time for supper, I call and tell them to head home.  We use to use walkie-talkies but he would set it down while playing and would not hear me when we called. With this phone, he can only dial 4 numbers plus 911, so it is just a basic phone.  No texting, no camera, etc.  I took a few minutes for my husband to call support and get it activated, they gave him a number, my husband programmed the numbers we wanted to him to dial, and now he is in business. We now just pay the additional $10 a month to our cell phone carrier. (He has to do chores to earn the $10 a month.)We recently when to a festival at our local college and he quickly went off with his friends.  We were able to keep in touch with him via his cell. He loves to show off his cool green phone to his friends and I love that I have a direct line to him whenever I need it. Buy it it you want the security of always being able to talk to your child who is not quite ready for a grown-up phone.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simple good phone", "Author": "S.
