{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone, very functional", "Author": "Avai D'Amico", "ReviewID": "R316QKHVDSYUEW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a while now and have been very pleased.  It seems to be much more durable than the two Moto Razr's I had previously.  I like the improved alarms.  I have my M-F alarm which lets me sleep in on weekends, reminders for my weekly and monthly appointments, and more.  My favorite feature is being able to use any music file as a ring tone or alarm.  I was unable to do this with both the Moto Razr's I had.  I can transfer any of my MP3s to my phone over USB.  The 1 GB storage is more than enough for me, but you can easily add more with the MicroSD card.  This phone has actually replaced my iPod now!  It doesn't have GPS and I can't watch TV, but I also didn't want to spend the extra money for the iPhone.  I don't see any reason not to recommend this phone to anyone, it is very durable (I'm an avid rock climber) and its battery lasts about a week per charge depending on use (I talk about 3k minutes per month).  I'm very satisfied with my Nokia Xpress Music.", "Date": "October 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Five stars and worth every one!", "Author": "Chris Swanson \"I'm just this guy, you know?\"", "ReviewID": "R2U0JO8UR7JSG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nokia 5310, aka \"The Music Xpress\", is one nifty little phone! Sure, it's no iPhone, but if you want something that got just about as many bells and whistles for a little less money, you want this phone.The 5130 is available in purple, orange, red and blue (I own the purple). It's very thin and small, but fits easily in the palm of your hand and doesn't give the impression it's going to fall apart if you look at it cross-eyed.The buttons are raised up just a bit. The display is bright and vibrant. If you have T-Mobile service with this phone, you'll find it can handle the My Favorites plan just fine, with nice little icons and customizable options fo each person.The phone has several nifty features, including a 2 megapixel camera that takes good-to-very-good quality pictures. It can also function as a video camera, doing both sound and image. There's no flash or self-portrait mirror, but you can make do. The screen acts as a view finder, of course. There's also four different levels of zoom and several different video effects (like black and white, negative, false color, etc). There's a nifty little mini-USB port you can use to move your files to a computer (assuming you have a cable. Thankfully the phone comes with one).There's also the usual selection of programs, like a calculator, alarm clock, organizer, etc. The system also comes with a few game demos, none of which are particularly memorable.Ah, but you want to know about the biggie, right? You want to know all about the music capability!Well, this phone doesn't disapoint. There's external music controls and an external volume control. You can turn it up loud enough to annoy the people next door if you really try. There's also a headphone jack that, thankfully, allows for normal headphones to be used. I have a neat little set I got on a Delta flight, and they work just fine.When I bought the phone it came with the USB cable I mentioned earlier, as well as a stereo hands-free headset with a detachable mic, and, joy of joys, a 1 gigabyte memory card! That's a really nice thing to have! I've got quite a bit of music on mine and it isn't even close to being filled. Tiny card, too. About the size of a fingernail.Overall there's no real reason not to recommend this phone. It's sleek and stylish, has a great price point, comes with plenty of goodies and plays music very, very well. It's worth every penny I paid for it, and that's not something I can often say!", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good all around phone", "Author": "MT", "ReviewID": "R2ZOIDM9BK87BP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not a cell phone snob but wanted one that was small, could hold music, and be able to take quality pictures and video. This phone has all of that. I was able to download almost 100 songs and 100s of pictures onto the phone which is impressive because it is so small. I don't know how they could make the phone more efficient which is why this model isn't much different than the newer versions. The only problem that I have with it is that it is so tiny that it is very easy to lose so make sure you have a case for it.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "A VERY BAD PRODUCT", "Author": "billy mambo", "ReviewID": "R26GZKZSR8WWII", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THE ITEM DID NOT WORK IT CAME WITH NO CHARGER NO MANUAL AND A BAD PACKAGING I TRIED TO CHARGE  WITH A CHARGER I BOURGHT FOR IT , IT DID NOT WORK.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Zero stars if possible", "Author": "low fat guy \"donut head\"", "ReviewID": "R2FQMST4NNYDSJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I love this phone and have owned many- this is the Chinese knock off and does not even come with an sd card as it is supposed to.

This Nokia basically made my ipod a fashion accessory - why carry a mobile and an ipod if mobile offers most of ipod's functions?There is also a camera - good enough to take pictures which will show on the screen to let you know who is calling and snapshots but their quality is only a little above acceptable so don't throw away your camera before you check it out thoroughly - and a radio, a nice addition (headphones, naturally included) although you should be prepared to recharge the battery quite often if you're addicted to listening all the time.In short - if you're shopping for small, sleek, light mobile phone with all the basic functions plus some added musical ones, this is your perfect choice. It's hard to get anything better for the money.", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "No warranty", "Author": "Arkadiusz", "ReviewID": "R3AI8HIFD90TOT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I strongly advise you guys not to buy this phone without warranty!
