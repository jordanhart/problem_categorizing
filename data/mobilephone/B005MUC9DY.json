{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great entry level Android smart phone.", "Author": "Ratchet&Spank;", "ReviewID": "R3GDL2B9YVEDYC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this at Walmart for $150 a few weeks ago to replace the cheap-o flip phone I've had for years.  If you're like me and are upgrading from a standard cell phone, I think you'll really love it.  If you're switching from an iphone or Galaxy S, you'll definitely notice the lack of bells and whistles.  Although, it might be worth loosing a few features to save money.  I've heard some reviewers mention the phone has froze on them to the point they had to take out the battery.  This has not happened to me and I use it quite a bit.PROS:- 3G and wi-fi are fast and work great.  I'm able to watch youtube videos and listen to music through Pandora on 3G with no problem.  I haven't tried Netflix on 3G, but it worked well on wi-fi.- Full access to the Android app market.- Only $45 a month for unlimited everything.  Through Verizon, AT&T;, or Sprint that would cost you over $100- Decent battery life.  It will make it through the day with normal use.  And by normal I mean an hour on the phone and an hour or two on the internet.  If you only make calls it will last you 3-4 days.- GPS worked fine the one time I used it.  Although it did make the battery drain a lot quicker...which is normal.CONS:- This phone uses Sprint's network and the reception is hit or miss.  I sometimes have to walk outside to get a good signal depending on where I am.  Check Sprint's coverage map to make sure it will work in your area.- No flash support.  It doesn't even worth with the flash app.  Apparently there's not enough ram or something.- Barcode scanner app doesn't work.  It doesn't have the right type of camera.Hope my review was helpful.  If you're wanting an affordable smart phone that works well without having to fork out a hundred dollars a month to use it, look no further.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great \"Everyday\" Phone", "Author": "Coleman", "ReviewID": "R40JZ0XZ8N2F9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "***EDIT 6/8/2013 This review was written when CDMA versions were sold (i.e. using Verizon towers instead of Sprint), if you are still looking for a Verizon prepay phone MAKE SURE IT SUPPORTS CDMA AND NOT GSM etc***I've had Straight Talk for about five or six months now, and have had the Samsung Galaxy Precedent for that much time as well. From what I understand, ST phones go on a phone-by-phone basis of what kind of service will work for it. A majority of ST phones run Verizon, and the Samsung (as well as some other smart phones) runs off of Sprint. That's the first thing I'm addressing here: If you are located in an area where Sprint is used and supported, this phone should connect just fine. Otherwise, be careful.I live in a rural city, and Straight Talk told me that my phone does not work in my area. That's basically to cover their butts, because if you check the Sprint coverage map this town is covered and I can attest to it. Not great signal like all the other Verizon users around here, but I haven't dropped a call yet.Moving on to the actual phone itself: This has been my first smart phone, and by all accounts I am very impressed. It's a very \"everyday\" phone and it shows. It sure as heck won't run anything fancy like Dead Space (heck, sometimes Angry Birds will stutter a bit), but I can very quickly hop onto Facebook, forums I frequent, my email, Twitter, and even use an app called TuneIn Radio to listen to the radio here and there. You can have it run off of the 3G network or use it's Wifi capabilities, especially in my area 3G isn't super fast but I can still stream music from it.I've been using my phone as much more than a phone. It's been my MP3 player (16GB micro SD card), it's been my Internet source for my laptop with tethering to 3G (Airports with Boingo!, you are terrible and I'm SO GLAD to have this phone to bypass that service), it's been my GPS for when I've been lost in the past, it's been my go-to quick Google search, etc etc.I have also managed to root the phone and get rid of a lot of the pre-installed software. Which brings me to another point: The battery could be much better. I've had to go through with a root uninstaller app and get rid of some software that would otherwise take up resources. I've bought an app called JuiceDefender Ultimate that I switch on when I'm trying to stretch out my battery life. I've had to go through the phone settings and ensure that profiles/accounts aren't being updated every minute, either off or every hour, etc. With all that said and done, a full charge will usually last me at least two to three days, but when the phone is on it's factory settings this could be significantly shortened to five to seven hours. (If anyone knows where to buy a good replacement battery for this phone to make it last longer, I and other Amazon users would really appreciate it! :) )Overall, the phone itself is a very good \"everyday\" phone. Now, about Straight Talk: there are multiple methods of payment, thankfully, such as going through their website, using Walmart.com, going to Walmart and picking up a card, or calling customer service. I recommend NOT calling customer service. In fact, as much as I LOVE my phone, Straight Talk needs to overhaul it's customer service. I didn't have an old number to transfer to this phone, so I didn't have to put up with that - however, there are been multiple accounts of users having bad experiences doing this (while a minority say that switching to their old number went through in about ten or so minutes and was painless). I've had to call in on a bank statement problem with ST once (turned out to be the bank all along), as a genuinely confused customer I wasn't too satisfied when I was being accused to trying to get another month of service when the reality was it was my banks fault. Maybe if, instead of blaming me, just telling to check with my bank first we wouldn't have had a bad experience and worse misunderstanding.I am a guy that doesn't like having their hand held when dealing with electronics and I want to know what I'm paying for exactly. I know I'm paying $50 a month for a phone with unlimited everything, and I try to figure out what I can and can't do with my phone on my own. If you usually end up calling customer service and technical support for a lot of your electronics, I wouldn't recommend Straight Talk. That doesn't mean I haven't had to call technical support before, but I don't do it on a frequent basis.Overall, I've been pretty satisfied with the Samsung Galaxy Precedent and would recommend it to anyone who needs a general phone (with it being more than a phone).PROS: - Great audio quality on the phone, including the speaker on the back of the unit and earpiece for calls. - Multiple methods of communication, such as GPS, WiFi, 3G, and Bluetooth. I use my Rocketfish RF-MAB2 bluetooth headphones with the phone, which is great as a pair of headphones for music and to quickly switch to a phone call when needed. - Phone can be rooted giving you more control. Tethering is great when you can't get to a hot spot, or the hot spot wants you to pay for their service. - Easily connect with Facebook, Twitter, email, texting, and more. - Multiple methods of payment to Straight Talk. I've even used the phone's web browser to make a payment once. - With the Droid OS, you get a lot of customization out of your phone to make it *yours*. - Tons of apps work with the phone.CONS: - Straight Talk customer service and technical support is not great and needs a face lift / overhaul. - Battery life is not great, will need to go through your phone settings thoroughly to make sure that anything taking up resources you don't care for isn't doing so anymore. - If you are looking for a gaming phone, move along, nothing to see here.NOTES: - Uses the Sprint network. - No physical QWERTY keyboard, everything is touch screen.EDIT: As of tomorrow, 7/16/2012, I will be ordering the HTC Evo V 4G from Virgin Mobile. This phone has had a very nice run, in fact it won't be going anywhere and will probably stick around the house somewhere as a backup just in case. But for now, I crave a new phone, bigger, better, etc, but I still stand by this review.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the phone...

Others will hopefully tell you more about the phone and all that it does. I'm not very techy. If it makes calls and texts, thats good with me. This phone does a whole lot more than make calls and texts, and I had a lot of fun getting to know the phone.The bad thing, unfortunatly, is that in the area that I am in most of the time, there is no signal. I live and work in a rural area, and this phone evidently runs off of different towers than the other straight talk phones. The service on this phone is non-existent for much of the roads I travel. Service was in and out throughout the day inside the building that I work in. When I *was* able to make a call from inside the building, the person I was talking to had trouble hearing me. Some texts went through, some did not.I'm pretty dissapointed, I really wanted this phone! But if it can't make a call the majority of the time, its just not going to work for me. So if you're in a rural area, think twice!I will say, Straight talk would get 5 stars from me for switching my phone back to an older one when I called them to tell them this one wasn't going to work for me.

Both use the Sprint network, which provides good service in large cities, and on major highways connecting large cities.  I drove from Texas to Georgia and had a signal the entire trip, but I was always on a major highway.  Sprint does not have good coverage in small towns and rural areas.  If you are unsure about the Sprint signal in your area, talk to the folks at the Radio Shack store closest to your home, as their staff are usually well informed about signal issues in their own neighborhood.The phone works great IF you learn to delete apps that you don't use, move as many apps as possible to the memory card, learn to use the included task manager to clear memory after closing an app, and use the included power widget to turn off Bluetooth, GPS, and wireless when they are not actually needed.I also downloaded a data switch widget that makes it easy to turn off 3g when I am not on the internet.  I now can go 24 hours on a single charge, if I avoid watching videos...that will drain the battery rather fast.Check prices on the Prevail and Precedent carefully at Amazon.com, Radio Shack, and Wal-Mart.

I found out later that Straight Talk has confirmed that the Precedent will run on the Sprint network.Because Straight Talk chose to use the Sprint network for this phone, the coverage on this phone will likely be similar to the coverage of Virgin Mobile or Boost Mobile who are also Sprint resellers; it will likely only work in major metropolitan areas + on most freeways. This is generally inferior to what I and current Straight Talk customers experience on the Verizon or AT&T; networks that all current Straight Talk phones use.Second: After one day with this phone, the battery will not charge as it states \"not a valid battery - check your manual.\" There is nothing in the manual about this phone battery error.

Westmoreland", "ReviewID": "R35C6DPOSSVBZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I pretty much have tried just about all prepaid phones at one time or another in an attempt to upgrade with the times.  I recently decided to try the Samsung Galaxy Precedent through Straight Talk as a possible replacement for my home phone.  I gotta say, while researching this product here @ Amazon, I saw mostly mixed or negative reviews for this phone.  It appears that the most common problem involved this model of phone using the Sprint network(which made the coverage non existant for some people).  And another big issue apparently was the battery life being somewhat horrible.  Against what the reviews here gave for this phone, I decided to try it anyway and see for myself if this phone was capable of what the positive reviews said about it.  I'm really glad I did so, because this is in my opinion the best and definately most high tech prepaid phone I've ever owned.First and foremost in the positive aspects of this phone for me is having a 3G capable phone.  Most other prepaid phones I've had in the past were nowhere near as great as this phone.  Then again, this is the first android phone I've had, so there really is no fair comparison in that department.  The internet capability is unbelievable for a prepaid carrier.  I can check my email, watch YouTube and logon to Facebook remotely from my cell phone(and this phone is actually faster and doesn't lag as much as my desktop computer).  The only real downside here is that supposedly you're limited access to the internet(which other users here have pointed out in their reviews).  Disappointing really, since using internet on a phone this fast is addictive.  Something Straight Talk might wanna fix in the future and specify more.  Their plan for this phone is misleading, because their $45 Unlimited Plan to me implies unlimited internet access and not limited to 1 or 2 GB's.The next area is call quality and clarity.  So far, this phone has had excellent call quality and second to none clarity.  For all intents and purposes, I use this phone more often than my landline home phone and it's more consistent.  Initially, I was hesistant to purchase this phone with all the negative reviews on it using Sprint's network.  Thankfully, it's not an issue for me, because the area in FL I live must be a hotspot for Sprint.  I have used this phone for long distance and local calls, and not once have I had a dropped call or bad clarity issues.Finally is the battery life, which does drain quickly.  However, most newer phones I've used(like Blackberries, touchscreens phones or now Androids)all don't have long battery lives.  But, considering what all you do with this phone, it's nothing charging it up once a day can't solve.  It's been my experience that as long as you are religious with monitoring your battery, you'll never end up with a dead cell phone.  Of course, I don't use my phone every day for calls, but I do occasionally surf the web and pretty much use my mp3 player everyday.  I can see this being a problem for some people, but for me it's a non-existent issue.All in all, I've enjoyed this phone and haven't regretted buying it, as I've had no dropped calls, freezing up problems(which was a major issue for some here) or any other problems.  One main thing I noticed here @ Amazon is the ridiculously high price label for this product.  I purchased the exact sane phone and unlimited airtime card for about $170 at Wal Mart.  I can't believe the same phone here is $100 more without an airtime card, as I usually find better deals here.One final thing I wanna point out for the casual prepaid users here is that with this phone you cannot use the $30 airtime card with this(or any other Android phone with Straight Talk).  You have to purchase the $45 Unlimited card monthly, which makes sense with this being an Android phone.  Definately the best prepaid deal I found, as Verizon, Go Phone and Net 10 all had more expensive monthly deals on their Androids.", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "New to smart phones so how the heck do you work it?", "Author": "G. Bell \"teacher\"", "ReviewID": "R2BR0IQAJI3QZ2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Remember when owner's manuals actually told you how things work?  This has two.  Both start you out in something and then \"follow the directions\" except you can't access the damn keyboard to put in requests.  Took me ages to figure out how to pull the number pad up.  Asked Samsung to point me at a step by step owner's manual.  They didn't.  They referred me to the phone company - which doesn't have one either.  Yes, I'm new to this.  No this is not \"intuitive\" like my Iphone friends rave about.Two other big downsides - the touch screen is nice and sharp for me but it doesn't respond by touch but rather by how  electric you are at the moment.  So, there are times, it just doesn't want to accept my touch and I don't like the oily fingerprints all over the screen.  And if you are learning like I am, it locks all the time.  Keep tapping it and press the on/off button and swipe the phone on - over and over and over and over...It's slow and operates on Sprint networks.  I'm in the middle of San Francisco, on top of Buena Vista park and I've got fluctuating one bar to three bars.  Tried to Google and spent a minute waiting for the first entry.I don't know about the bar code app not working.  That is one of the major reasons I bought the thing; so I could price compare in the store.However, as a phone, it has better reception that the Motorola Metro PCS that I had before. It's compatible with hearing aids.  And it apparently can do some great things and by pass much of my constant search for the damn keyboard screen by using the talk feature.  Youtube videos make me think more highly of it.  Especially the talk feature.  Google around and look.  The plan at 45 a month is good.A 4G LG phone will be offered soon.  I'm not that big of fan of LG - their televisions look good but don't seem to last that long.  So, hmm.  If' Iphones were offered on other networks I'd buy one.

First off my phone gives me a message very often saying sd card not found. So i have to take the sd card out and put it in again. Plus, sometimes when I have an incoming call it freezes up to where I cant even answer the phone. It also does that when im calling someone and say they dont answer, it will not let me hang up. So im forced to leave a voice message obviously saying nothing because im trying to get the phone to hang up. Very awkward. I always get service in my house but sometimes all my bars will be gone and I will get no service at all. It doesnt even help if i move to another spot in the house. I usualy always have to take my battery out and put it back in again just for it to restore the bars and get service. Which it had no reason to lose any bars in the first place. Then, just recently I am not able to hear good and people arent able to hear me well, I always have to put my phone on speaker phone just to have a conversation. Which makes it pretty embarassing walking around having a full convo with someone and everyone else to hear. In addition, sometimes it will not charge, i plug it up and nothing happens. When i am sure my charger isnt damaged. But after about 20 minutes it starts charging like nothing ever happened. This is after trying two of the same charges. I have been dealing with straight talk phones for almost 3 years now. The only reason why I have been with them for so long is because right now I cant afford to go with at&t; and sprint and pay a high monthly bill.

While I don't completely regret it, this was definitely a piss-poor choice for my foray into the world of smartphones.Battery life is dismal.  I literally have to charge this thing every single night and even then I worry about it dying on me with what would otherwise be moderate to light use on my previous phone.  That's with everything turned off (no wifi, no sync, no bluetooth and no gps) and the display brightness set to medium while running maybe the application to support texting.  That's it.  Battery life is still beyond awful.You can't transfer any apps fully over to the sd card.  While you would think this would be one of those totally obvious things that would essentially cripple a smartphone to not have available, they chose to prevent the phone from being able to have more than say 3 decent apps ever loaded onto it no matter what.  Asinine?  Absolutely.  Chance is the phone can't run the apps/games you want to load onto it anyway so I guess the point is moot.I've had the phone for 2 months and already after some kind of glitched out update, google maps and my bank of america app don't work anymore.  GREAT!  The only real reasons I bought a smartphone are now totally quashed.  I guess I should feel fortunate that the browser app still functions.  I thought I told the phone to not auto-update in the first place but expecting this sad contraption to actually do what I tell it to is probably a bit of a stretch.Sometimes, the screen randomly just stops responding - which is ultra-helpful when you're on a call with roadside assistance and you have to put your policy number in so someone doesn't crash into your car on the side of the freeway.  Thanks Samsung!The box I looked at advertised a 800 mhz processor, which it turns out is light-years behind what is required to play scramble and watch netflix.

And now I can tell people I have a smartphone so they don't look at me like I'm homeless anymore.  Oh, and the screen is really quite pretty to look at.

I really like it but also keep in mind that I am upgrading from a samsung candy bar sliding phone with slow a$$ internet. The only problem I have so far with this phone is this....Apparently, you cannot use the camera without first inserting an sd card. I have had alot of phones and never had that be an issue.I am also not quite sure how to get everything set up but that will come in time. It works for me. I have watched videos on youtube, I have checked and set up email accounts. The best part about it is that I paid $70 and got it from straighttalk.com. Its refurbished but hey it looks and works like brand new out of the box and I have a 1 year warranty on the phone just as if it was new. So I feel as though I got a bargain. Otherwise I would honestly never have paid $200 for this phone because I don't think its worth that much but it is a solid little phone. Also so far battery life doesn't seem to be an issue for me but i plan to get the app that will save the battery life. I will update as I learn more about the phone. But overall I think if you want something nice without having to spend alot of money its a good phone. Only 3 out of 5 stars because of the camera issues.****UPDATE****After playing around with the phone and some trial and error, I am happy to report that I have worked out some of the kinks I was having. First thing I did was to install a 16gig sd card. Now I have access to the camera and video recorder. However, the camera doesn't take great pics. In fact my old phone takes better pics than this. In addition, I read alot about people rooting their phones in order to be able to use them as wifi hotspots. Well I was able to figuire out how to do that and I didn't have to root my phone to do it. Not only does it work on my tablet but also on my pc. Of course this is not something that I would do often but its good to have access to in case of an emergency.Having said that I am just amazed at all the things this little phone can do. If you are looking for a solid android phone but don't want to spend an arm and a leg to get it.

Frustrating to say the least. A lot of the apps available don't even work anyway though. They aren't compatible and they will constantly \"force close\". The phone itself also freezes a lot. I work with 2 other women who have the same phone and the same exact problem. I'll be in the middle of a call that I have to pull my keypad for and it won't do anything. It won't hang up, turn off or anything so I eventually just have to take the battery out.

I must admit I was almost convinced not to buy it considering most of the reiviews I read had alot of things in common such as the limited data service for ST and the short battery life and bad service coverage. Well having this phone so far has been a wonderful experience its only been 3 days since I had it and I havent had any problems as far as the coverage it has a very good signal in my area. To increase the life-span of my battery I make sure to go to settings and manage any running apps by force stop, disconnect my 3G and wi-fi connections, and also downloaded a battery-life saver app which all have helped my phone hold a full and steady charge. I also downloaded a data manager app to ensure that i am staying under the 2GB limit, after doing some research about the ST plan and TOS I have learned that their is no such thing as unlimited data if you go over the 2GB limit your service will be subject for termination with NO REFUND, so please invest in this app if you are a heavy data user or subscribe to another carrier because its not worth losing a whole $45 just to stream a few videos and making your phone a wi-fi hotspot. I mean people always complain about having to do all of these extra tasks just to maintain the phone and the plan, but really its worth saving the money. I bought this phone refurbished on Amazon.com and I really feel like I got what I paid for which was a great phone with good service.

Well I have an idea, Ill explain more below. This is my first \"smart\" phone, and I have to say, this surprised me to no end. It is sleek, light, and a very good overall phone if you are first getting started.Pros:* Straight talk's 45 bucks a month unlimited. Every time I pay my bill I cant believe how great it is that I have unlimited everything.* GPS..I have always despised the garmin type GPS receivers that made you pay for updates-those days are over. With GPS tracking on google maps, type in where you wanna go, and watch the little arrow (which is you) go! Unbelievable...* No buttons (on the face). This thing was WAY sleeker than any phone Ive ever had. Just touch face buttons which light up when you hit em... extremely elegant.* Speed... for the price, I still cant believe what you get. Every once in a while it lags, but when Im clicking on my apps, I have very few issues, even for FB (unless you are in a slow 3G area)..* NETFLIX-yes, the real deal, very nice...but you might need to connect your WIFI.* Swype...my fingers are a little big, so if you swipe a word over the letters in the proper order, then it guesses the word. Does it quite well actually-awesome!Cons:* Battery life... not as good as it can be definitely. --BUT--- If you go into task manager and stop the apps you dont use, you will increase battery life by 25-40%...

I ordered the phone in October 2011 from Straight Talk for about $200 with the month card.When I first got it I loved it! The touch screen worked well and I loved the swipe feature when texting.

At first I was excited. It has a nice screen, isn't too heavy or bulky, and I haven't had a problem with dropped calls. However, as many people have mentioned this phone has issues locking on calls; it doesn't do it all the time, it seems to only be when it's LIKE, REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT. But my biggest problem with this phone is its (in 2012) laughable amount of storage (which is mitigated somewhat by the fact that they include a 2gb micro sd card, however it doesn't work worth *insert expletive here*, it won't let you save the things you want on it, and half of the time the phone can't even find it. And while it has the Android name on it, the truth is it's only running android 2.2 and a customized (read: LIMITED) version at that. On top of all this, while I wouldn't expect a prepaid carrier to be as good as one of the major carriers, Straight-Talk 3G SUCKS. It's like dial-up all over again. You won't use it  because you'll get tired of pulling your hair out and chewing your fingernails till they bleed. On Wi-fi it's a completely different experience, great if you happen to work at home and never go out. So in closing, this is basically a smartphone that can't do anything a smart phone is supposed to do. I give it 3 stars because it when it does work correctly it's decent, as a voice phone it works fine and at least you get a free sd card for all the handwringing.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great step up", "Author": "Blanknewt", "ReviewID": "R1EPLUS6NXF2QP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used Straight talk phones from the beginning and the Galaxy Precedent is a big step up.

I am guessing there is not even as much as a single gigabyte of internal memory in this phone. The phone's memory is occupied by the operating system and filled up with just a few installed apps.The problem with a small amount of internal memory is that it is very unpredictable when the text message memory fills up and won't allow anymore new text messages unless you free up some memory.The phone has an SD memory card slot. There is absolutely no option in the operating system to select that all incoming text message must be saved directly to the memory card. The operating system only save incoming text messages to the internal memory. There is such a tiny amount of allocated text message memory space available. It fills up so fast and when it does, any more incoming text messages are ignored and rejected, you will never see them.It is absolutely technically possible that the operating system could save incoming text messages to the memory card. It is only because of corporate politics that Google did not write an operating system that can save text messages to the memory card.There is less than a single gigabyte of internal memory inside of this phone.Don't ever buy a phone unless you know exactly how much internal memory is inside of the phone.
