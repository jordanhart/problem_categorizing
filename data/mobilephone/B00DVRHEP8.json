{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Vast improvement over the original Hydro", "Author": "S. J McCartin", "ReviewID": "R3TKFQX3D1XPHU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the original Hydro back in January, while it isn't a bad phone it left much to be desired in several areas.  The original was android 4 with the same processor and amount of memory.  The phone was sort of stocky, not sleek like the newer offerings out there and there was no dedicated camera button (a deal breaker for many people).  I like the concept of the hydro because I ride my motorcycle a lot and have been caught in more than a few sudden deluges, other riders in the pack have lost phones this way but no worries for me with the hydro.  I liked the original but something I had on the phone was causing almost daily spontaneous reboots, never could figure out what it was, all the same junk on the new phone and no issues but it's also a newer OS.The EDGE is an improvement over the original mostly with the larger screen and the newer Jelly Bean (android 4.1) OS.  Then there is the redesigned case and changes to some elements of the operating system.  Both phones are light weight and I would never consider them hefty and well built but the EDGE is a bit more ergonomic and feels better to hold for long periods of time.  The stock battery is 1600 mAh. Due to the nature of the beast I doubt they'd ever come out with larger capacity batteries since there is only so much space and the back must be sealed to keep out the water. My only complaint about the EDGE is the back, it feels flimsy, the redesigned latch should be an improvement over the old phone (which had a reputation for getting loose and unlocking itself) but if the back is taken on and off a lot I'd be worried about it getting broken and thus leaking water because of an improper seal.  The transflash or micro SD slot is still under the battery inside the back but in theory anyway you would not be removing that every day.  Bright side about the back is generally phone backs become available on ebay pretty quick because people break then and want a new one.I've only had the phone a few days and it's taking a little getting used to, task management is no longer by a dedicated button as on the old phone now the running programs appear on the menu pulled down from the top of the screen.  If you can't swipe to shut the program down you can click and hold and go to the force stop option for that program.  It's a lot easier in the newer OS to disable built in software I never use.  I don't use youtube, shut it off, there were other things too that I disabled which saves on system resources whether they are actually running or not.  The battery saver that comes stock on the phone seems to work pretty well, I had a purchased one but it was interfering with my bluetooth working properly so I went back to the stock app.  I have a lot of apps on here, have used half the memory and even put one on that had caused problems with the old phone and so far no issues.I like the phone, it was worth the money to upgrade over the old original hydro.  You can spend a lot more money for a bigger screen faster processor etc. but in the end if you have problems with your phone getting wet or your kid dropping it in the fish tank or the toilet the waterproof feature is priceless.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DVRHEP8"}}
