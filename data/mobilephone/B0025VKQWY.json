I originally bought it locked to T-mobile UK paid for it to be unlocked, and De-branded the phone myself to get it to the generic version without the lame t-mobile junk all in it. That being said I really like this phone.Pros:-5 mega-pixel Camrea-DVD quality video-You tube application (unfortunately streaming is played over the DIVX player and not flash)-Google maps-8g of internal memory- Expansion slot up to 32g micro-Email (pop3 and Microsoft exchange)- FM transmitter- Fm radio- High resolution screen- Intuitive user interface- Java-WIFI-Blue tooth with stereo supportCons:-No way to turn off popup events notice annoying ass hell- The GPS takes forever to find my location, most of the time it cant- Very small onscreen keys for texting make it a challenge- Sometimes the phone gets confused about what position its in and wont rotate successfully when typing.- no USA 3GSupposedly according to the help section in the software suite this phone can be used as a blue tooth web cam.. I have no idea how to though.Overall:The call quality of this phone is good, there have been a lot of complaints about battery life but for me this hasn't been a problem. Seems to last the whole day just fine with moderate use. I had a G1 before this phone and its battery life was a lot worse. I used the fm transmitter in my car for the first time today it seemed to work okay considering it's a phone, downer is bass didn't seem to make it.This phone is very sleek and sexy and functional I love how thin it is and how well the camera works. The wifi and bluetoth work very well. And the screen is very clear. Even with the GPS acting lame I love this phone and would 5-star it if I could turn off stupid events notifications!!!!", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bittersweet experience", "Author": "Steven Burns", "ReviewID": "R13TYV3ENG8ECG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had this phone for about three months, until it fell from about 3 feet and the screen broke.That said, I'll write this review being objective, based on the whole experience as a user.Pros:- Capacitive Screen: Yes, just like the iPhone, no need to press, just touch. You can perform gestures such as sliding pictures or scaling them with two fingers.- Nice interface: the rotating cube is great. The contact manager is as good as it gets, I loved it.- Wonderful screen resolution: 480x800- Good looking and not bulky at all, especially for that resolution.- Great multimedia features: decent camera, video with sound, 8GB, nice music player.- Good battery life when used as a music player: I had this phone playing music for hours in a party with no need for a charger.Cons:- Average battery life with day to day use.- Slow: Browsing is embarrassingly slow. I thought that was normal for a cell phone until I saw some other phones browsing way faster, even phones worth half the price. Navigation is fast 90% of the time but occasionally it'll freeze for a few seconds. Same thing with the accelerometer, sometimes it just doesn't realize it has to rotate the screen.- Interface mistakes: regardless of the great looks, it has some obvious mistakes. For example, when you make a call it locks the screen, so far so good. But sometimes you need to unlock the phone (to dial an extension number for example) and guess what, as soon as you click the unlock button on the highly sensitive screen there's a red \"hang up\" button just below it waiting for you to click it by mistake.Also, IMHO the \"call\" button on the phone should open the dial-pad and the one on the screen the \"recent calls list\", not the other way around.- Kind of fragile: I've had Nokias fall harder with no problems whatsoever.Well, that pretty much summarizes it, I hope you find my review useful.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "LG Arena KM900", "Author": "k1skanation", "ReviewID": "R2FE5Z9OXZ8K71", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for over a month and I couldn't be happier.  At first, there were freezes, reboots, and other faulty software problems.  However, after updating the firmware, it's quite an outstanding phone.Great signal strength (for me at least.)GPS works very well after a 5 minute modification (Don't quite understand why they didn't make it work well in the first place, however I can't complain.)Camera is nice, not the greatest but no phone's camera is.Video recorder, however, is very VERY good.  It records videos in 720x480 resolution (DVD resolution) @ 30fps.The music player needs touch-ups, however it works.  What I enjoy about it is the sound quality.  It's almost astounding how great it sounds.The major gripe I have is the DivX and XviD player.  You're forced to convert your already-encoded DivX movies to the mobile standard (320x240 or less resolution, while the phone's resolution is 800x480).  However, if you take the time to convert your movies to mp4 format, you can easily play DVD quality videos on the handset.All in all, I enjoy the phone.", "Date": "June 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Disappointing, but gets the job done.", "Author": "Joyce A.", "ReviewID": "RIVG4C1AX7SZF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for four weeks now, and here are some points I'd like potential-buyers to read through.PROS:- Organized and intuitive interface.- Built strong. A case wasn't necessary - I only bought a screen protector to prevent it from scratching.- The slot for the charger/USB has a slide-cover instead of a flimsy rubber cover.- Connectivity. This model is compatible with Mac operating systems (use iSync).- When connecting to your computer, you are given a mass storage option, so it can act as an external drive if you wish.- 5 megapixel camera. However, photo quality isn't great in many environments/settings.- Wifi and bluetooth.- Battery life is excellent. Many reviews claim their phone only lasts a day, but if you turn your wi-fi/bluetooth off whenever it's not in use, the phone can last up to three days.- Excellent sound.- 8 GB storage space.CONS:- If you live in the US, the power adapter it comes with may not work. I received a cheaply-made adapter from LG that looked like it had been chewed on, so I had to buy a new UK to USA adapter. A temporary solution is to charge your phone with your computer, via USB cable.- Incredibly SLOW. I cannot emphasize this enough. It takes seconds for the phone to recognize that I'm trying to open an application or attempting to text. When the other customer reviews said it was slow, I didn't think it would be THIS severe.- When turning the phone from portrait to landscape mode (or vice versa), the phone's accelerometer  doesn't register the movement for several seconds, or doesn't rotate at all.- Leaves an \"imprint\" of the last application open on the screen. When I'm on the homescreen, I can see faint outlines of my lock-screen or text messages.- Occasional freezing.- Limited storage reserved for text messages. Because this storage capacity was 8GB, I thought I could save a lot of my texts - this is not the case. It only holds about 300.OTHER THOUGHTS:- Make sure you know your PIN/PUK number when you insert your SIM card. Because I've had the same phone for years, I forgot my AT&T; PIN and went through a ton of trouble trying to get it (theft accusations, stealing Joyce A's (my) SIM). Go to your provider first, and tell them you're switching to a new phone and would like your PIN.- I was expecting a lot from a phone over $200, and I probably wouldn't have bought it if I had known it was going to be this slow. But it gets the job done, and is an alright alternative to the iPhone if you're interested in not being bound to a two-year contract.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "First phone I have really liked in years", "Author": "R. Klein \"Arubawriter\"", "ReviewID": "R14KUIVWTHW1CA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had 5 phones over the past three years, and this is the first with which I have been truly happy. Each of us looks for certain features as we learn what does not work with each new phone; for me, a clear readable screen (even without glasses) a good loud ring, (I kept missing calls with my Samsung 750,) and a responsive touchscreen (again, another frustration with my Samsung) all were the points that made me choose this phone, as well as the price and package I was offered by my mobile provider. (I must admit-in bright sunlight it is nearly impossible to make out the screen)So far, after one month, I have been very happy with the phone. As a photograper, I agree the camera is just eh, your subjects MUST be still for a clear shot, but in the fine quality mode it is a pretty good shot for a phone camera.I do find the sharp, brilliant screen and ample memory a big plus for me as a photographer. I carry my portfolio in my phone, and can show someone a great looking gallery of art shots that really is impressive with the color quality of the LG Arena.Don't need GPS so far; so I have nothing to say about that-I find with ear buds the music sounds great-try the dolby sound. Without buds, a bit tinny, but loud enough to hear in your handbag  or from another room-very important to me!All in all, very pleased with this phone-I get a lot of compliments on its looks, as well, if that is important to you.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful, very functional mobile phone LG KM900", "Author": "Johan W.
