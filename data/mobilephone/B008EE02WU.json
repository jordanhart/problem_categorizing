This phone came with all kinds of accessories, so much different than the ones from the big cell retailers where all you get is a phone and a charger.  There were nice surprises at every turn, like a built in radio, menus that make sense, and options available where there should be.  I searched for several months to find a good rugged phone with a few bells and whistles, but not a smartphone, and at a reasonable price.  If you are sick of the crap from the big name cell companies, try this phone.  I'm picky as all getout, if it worked for me, it will work for you!  I can confirm that it works on at&t; for voice calls and voice mail, not sure about data.  I just popped in my old sim card and was ready to go.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "A real \"smart\" phone", "Author": "J.

If you are a fully functioning and capable human being and you don't need to depend on a portable electronic device to do your thinking for you and constantly entertain you because you're not a spoiled brainless self-important yuppie, then this the phone for you.  Is exactly as advertised, has great battery life.

I love the ruggedness and waterproof features.  Battery life is excellent.  Sound quality is poor for both users--I can't hear the caller and they can't hear me--but is something I deal with because I need a durable phone.  My only other complaint is that the keypad always beeps when pressed even when the keypad is locked.  I would recommend this phone to someone who needs durable more than sound quality.  I have not tried using bluetooth ear piece which may help with sound quality.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "amazing phone", "Author": "gonzalo cortes cruz", "ReviewID": "R3H0VOZV4H1DQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is for my mom, what a nice phone . i will get one for me too i loveit", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "DOES NOT WORK WITH AT&T;", "Author": "slamdi", "ReviewID": "R38JUGJ224Q1FB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Warning.
