{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone for older people!", "Author": "M. S. Velazquez", "ReviewID": "RNLWYZCKMRGUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say I got this cell phone for my mother who's around her sixties and she hates advanced phones so she was looking for something simple. So I got on Amazon searching for her favorite phone color which is Pink and found this phone that was ATT and unlocked. Then I immediately showed her and she fell in love with it because it was something simple and basic she can use when she needs to keep in contact with all her family. When the phone arrived it was a very nice phone and something anyone can figure out. Over all I totally recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't like advanced touch screen phones or those smart phones, this phone is perfect for someone who just wants it for taking pictures and talking on the cell phone for constant communication.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "BEST PHONE", "Author": "Elaine G.

Shaw", "ReviewID": "R1F8FB084IHHKJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace a Motorola Razr which was defective.  This phone is basic, easy to use, good size keys,good reception, and holds a charge for a few days. It is made of plastic (and feels a bit flimsy), but for the price, it is a great phone.  It came with a wall charger, so the add-on in the Amazon posting to get the wall charger (which I did) was not necessary.  It did not come with a car charger.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone did not work at all", "Author": "nnyklw", "ReviewID": "R3O3CDPHRZPYX1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my young daughter and she loved the color and the flip model. However, it came in a box that was clearly used, rundown and unsealed. The phone had Rogers Telecom on it which looked at if it was refurbished. I thought I had bought a brand new phone. We tried to charge the phone and it did not work nor light up. We left it overnight and it still did not work so we called TigerDirect and because we ordered it from Amazon, they processed the return.", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Deal", "Author": "DBW", "ReviewID": "RJZSR71NASCUR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this to replace my mom's black 6085 that she had for a couple of years.  This is her favorite phone and I was so glad to find it on here and for such a great price.  I will be ordering another one to keep an extra for her on the chance her's dies again in another year or so.  It was new and in all original packaging.  Awesome deal.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Basic flip phone", "Author": "House Music", "ReviewID": "R26VF2KKTPQWSW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to admit, I love this phone. I'm on my 4th one in as many years (maybe longer). I do landscape work and I keep this phone in my pocket all day. I crush it, sweat profusely on it, drop it (frequently) and use it constantly. Eventually the fate it suffers from all my abuse is that the display goes out, I have to wonder if it has something to do with the flip action. I don't know of a touch screen phone that would stand up to this kind of abuse. The only down sides are texting with it sucks, but I only text moderately and I don't use this phone for internet purposes as it would probably be very limited. I do go online and download songs and games (only text twist and bejeweled). That is the other bad thing about this phone it doesn't have much space, I have to download  pictures to an sd mini card or email them to myself so I can keep them and eventually erase some text messages especially if they contained images. This phone does not receive video sent to me but it does have one really cool feature that many phones don't, I can zoom in on pictures that are sent to me. If you want a durable basic phone that has great reception I highly recommend this model. At&t; is my provider, I don't know if this phone works for other providers and I would be careful who I bought it from (see other reviews)", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "WORST ONLINE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE", "Author": "Allan G.", "ReviewID": "R35UZ4TRFAYGZK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a pink phone and got a black one instead.

Colour ok, the finish isn't very strong. After a few days of use a chip appeared in the casing. This was a little disappointing, but aside from this one cosmetic fault, I enjoy this phone. I can take photo, they may not be top quality, but I'm not complaining. What can you expect for the prize. Overall it functions great, I use it alot and it's never given me any trouble to date.

The manual is a joke and is a Nokia generic black & white 8-pager. I question that it is even by Nokia since I subsequently downloaded the real Nokia user manual for this phone from another site (114 pages compared to 8). And the battery is made in China and has no indication it is an OEM version. Also, it was fully charged when it arrived. THEREFORE, I presume I have been sold a used phone with a worthless, self-printed manual and a Chinese non-OEM battery. I would not recommend buying from this vendor.
