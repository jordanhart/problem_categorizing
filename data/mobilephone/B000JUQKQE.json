She was going to settle for a differerent one and very disappointed. She was so excited.  The phone works great and does support the 850 band width. If it didn't it would not work on our site. My network transmitts at 850. I had a phone that did not have the 850 and did not work on our network. This is a great looking phone!!", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "This phone is NOT GSM 850MHz", "Author": "Taam", "ReviewID": "R226WMQBK5A0UK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Be careful - Amazon identifies this phone as being GSM 850MHz.  It is not.  Read the 'Vital Statistics' section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850MHz.  Check the Sony web page (and other people who sell this phone) and you will see that it does not work on 850MHz.I don't own this phone but was researching it for a friend when I discovered this discrepancy.  I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror case - I have no idea if this phone is really good or not.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000JUQKQE"}}
