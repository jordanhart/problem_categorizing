Roberts", "ReviewID": "R8O3FVAJBZ403", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have tried several phones and this one, although not exactly what i want, I decided to keep it.My main issue with this phone is that it doesn't get good reception in my house. This is an ongoing issue for me even though I have a small one family wood frame house, and get a good signal as soon as I step out the door. I guess I will have to live with this for now.Another problem is the keyboard. Letters are very tiny, especially the ones that have numbers on the top of the key and letters on the bottom. And what makes it much worse is when the keyboard lights up. The keys are white and the lights are light color so it is nearly impossible to see the letters. There doesn't seem to be a way to shut off the lighted keys or change the color.With all previous phones I have been able to insert a picture into a SMS message, but with this one it has to be sent as a MMS. This has to be set up, and I have googled this and am not as of yet able to set this up. So I will have to remove the storage card and download it into my computer. The card is easily accessible,but I would like to be able to send pictures.On the other hand:It's cute. I like the colors. It's a little wider than I am used to but I am sure after time that won't matter. It is pretty thin.It didn't come with a manual, just a startup guide. But I found an entire manual on line, very detailed. Just be sure to look for the one that says it's in English (unless you want another language).The keyboard locks! This one will not start dilaing by mistake in my pocket. But It takes 3 buttons to unlock it.It has more alarms than I could possibly need! I rely on alarms on my phone for everything.I was looking for a bigger screen, but graphics are great.I waited until I had this a month before reviewing it so I could really see what I like and dislike. The biggest flaws are, not being able to send pictures, three buttons to unlock it, I do not see that it has a redial. I have set this aside for now, will use it as a spare. Have gone back to another phone that is more user friendly.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "something like a Blackberry to me...", "Author": "Shaberraca Colbert", "ReviewID": "R1TKDW28SCJ8ML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "loovee the fact it has a full keyboard...and its easy and sleak design that i love, been trynna get a blackjack...n now that i have one,, i love it...so i would rather the phone overall as excellent!", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "NOT RELIABLE OR LONG LASTING....", "Author": "Adonis", "ReviewID": "RN1U7D458OMFB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone was good for a while when I first got it. But after a couple months it began lagging a little ... also it doesnt show when I have new text messages. As soon as i dropped it, the back broke. I bought this phone in replacement of my iPhone & i am aware that it was a BIG CHANGE , but it still couldve worked better. On top of THAT , the part where the charger goes in , is broken. EVERY PERSON I KNOW who has this phone has this problem. I guess you can call it a common defect. but I guess the phone isnt the worst phone, but i still suggest you save your money and buy a great phone that will last you long or you'll end up buying a new one every few months like me!", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung BlackJack II I617 Unlocked Phone", "Author": "Johanna D", "ReviewID": "R2KIDE7VTNF0L8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone because I had went through about six android phones in under a year and a half. I wanted something a little older and more reliable, and so far I am very pleased. The phone is unlocked, but it is an AT&T; phone, which is my carrier, so all of the internet features work for me. The shipping was excellent, it came the day after it shipped, and shipped the same day that I purchased it. The screen is a bit small compared to the phones that I am accustomed too, but the font size is customizable, and there is a great zoom feature which works well with my poor vision. The keys can be a bit difficult to see at times since they light up pink, so in medium light it is difficult, but in the light or complete dark the keys are fine. The ringer is loud and the appearance of the phone is cute. All in all, I am glad that I went with this phone, it comes with some great preloaded features, although some (like Myspace) are outdated, there is am app store. I don't plan to use this for internet use though, so I can't comment too much about the mobile web. There are threaded text messages which is nice, and the home screen is very customizable.***UPDATE*** Had to return the phone, it became unresponsive to any type of input except for the on button (which only lights the screen up, does nothing else) am returning the phone.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "There aren't enough stars!", "Author": "Alta", "ReviewID": "RT9JNYCCB6LIJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best phone I have ever used and it does everything you could want it to and some you didn't even know you wanted!  It is also pink (mine)which I love because it is the sophisticated cinnamon pink not glaring neon pink.  I like the fact that there is an indicator light that tells you when it is through charging instead of a tone that you might not hear.  It is very easy to use, I have already loaded my music and wallpapers to it along with my contacts just by using the memory card from my other phone which is more easily accessible on this one...you have an outside door instead of it being inside the battery housing.  It is 3G and it is readily synced to other devices and bluetooth.
