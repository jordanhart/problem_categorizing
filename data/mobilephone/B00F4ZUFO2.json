{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works like an iphone", "Author": "ABU KOROMA", "ReviewID": "R1HW2QLW8AH7TY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone operates similar things that an iphone or galaxy does. It downloads a variety of apps like facebook, skype, weather, whatsapp, viber, and so on. Most important, it works international. You just need to buy a sim card for a particular country and you can communicate with the rest of the world. The camera is superb, can video a whole two-hours event. It also has dual ports for two sims. Charging last long.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "I wouldn't suggest buying it", "Author": "Danny Kring", "ReviewID": "R2IBTRHLJWAQUT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "it is a cheap phone I'm glad I only paid $50 no 3G no 4G no GPSit is a basic Android phone", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "medjai", "ReviewID": "R1KMZ9LL6C1EV1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is really a piece of crap.

I have StraightTalk used it for over a year and like saving money from the high prices named brand options but StraightTalks compatible phone choices were lacking. This one looked promising looked and worked like a iPhone Clone, I love it for internet where it is fast and works great, my little one loves borrowing it for playing games on it that she says are faster than her computer. She likes the font and back camera too. But unless I can use it as a phone on StraightTalk, to me it is just a really small screen tablet. I wished I researched its comaptibility before I bought it. Thought I should let you know before anyone else makes my same mistake.", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "don't like this phone", "Author": "kea35", "ReviewID": "R1KTOGM71YEFUB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "can't access google and takes forever to down load apps and most apps won't work on this phone I have a simple mobile sim card never had any problems with any other android phone", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "Jermaine wright", "ReviewID": "R1J55ZSVQTWR78", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is a good phone.  it didn't give me no problem plus the person i bought it for love it the only thing I don't like about this phone it don't come with a flashlight but every thing else work great on it", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "bad phone , ripe off by seller", "Author": "barbara aboagye", "ReviewID": "R1PH82X0AXRT8U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "very bad product ,is overheating ,it goes off by it self.
