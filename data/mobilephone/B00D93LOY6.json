{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Absolute Best Phablet Experience", "Author": "methylamine", "ReviewID": "RZB0IQJ8HQHMB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Full disclosure, I purchased the i9200 from an eBay seller as there are no 16gb versions available for this device on amazon. Price was four seventy nine for the 16gb version.  I found the 8gb version of this phone severely limited the amount of apps I could download. 16gb is perfect as I could download multiple 3D HD games like dead trigger, need for speed and ashphalt hd without filling up the phones internal storage.  I also purchased the i9205 LTE version from Amazon about a month ago but I had to return that device since it had some issues.I'm a Galaxy Note user who has had the note since September of 2011. When the Note 2 came out I decided to skip it because I didn't think it was that worthy of an upgrade. So the Note has been my primary device for almost 2 years.Like you, I discovered the Mega 6.3 and began reading up on it and watching video reviews online. My initial worry was that it wouldn't be as fast as the current flagships and that I'd regret buying a device with last years specs.My reasoning to go ahead an purchase the Mega was based on the fact that to me it would feel like an upgrade since I was coming from my old Note.After using the Mega all my fears of it being underpowered and slow were gone. The device has a large bright crisp LCD display which I can now see clearly in daylight! The 1.5 GB RAM is handling my multitasking very well as I've yet seen a launcher redraw occur. The device is very snappy and has had no issues playing large MKV files. One of the coolest features that I was excited about was the IR port. Now you can control all your living room devices with your phone. The i9200 camera is on par with the galaxy note 2. For some reason the mega 6.3 i9205 that I tested had a poor performing camera. This i9200 performs much better,  not sure if different firmware is the reason. Either way I'm much happier with the camera quality on the i9200.The big win with this phone is the sheer amount of real estate you get. The original Note fits within the Mega 6.3's display area. You aren't just getting a phone when you get a Mega 6.3 you are also getting a small tablet. This device is a true Phablet. While the Note 1 and 2 were big devices the Mega elevates the browsing and media viewing experience to a true tablet level experience. If this is what you are interested in then I highly recommend picking up this device. So to recap, this device has a great display, versatile form factor, decent camera and great performance.And I hope I don't understate that the battery life is AMAZING!. I'm used to phones beeping low battery warnings around 5-6pm. With the Mega I no longer have to worry about my battery life. I literally cannot kill the battery. By the time I hook up the charger at night its 11PM and the Mega still has 20% battery left. And this is with HEAVY usage. I can take the Mega off charger at 6am and still have battery left in the very late evening.If you are trying to win the antutu, quadrant benchmark wars then I suggest you stay away from the Mega as the S4 is the current flagship which is putting up crazy benchmark numbers.If you are looking for a large crisp HD display with last years flagship specs and excellent real world performance then the Mega 6.3 is your device. The only thing that should hold you back from this purchase is whether you want to wait for the Note 3 which will have the S-Pen, better camera and a 1080P display. The Mega 6.3 I picked up was the 16gb version for four seventy nine shipped from e bay. The unlocked international note 3 will start at mid $700's most likely.I can personally confirm that this phone (i9200) does work on AT&T; 3G and 2G frequencies. My Mega 6.3 i9200 is running on AT&T; 3G HSPA+. Unlike the unlocked Note N7000 and Galaxy S II I didn't have to enter any APN settings when I inserted my AT&T; SIM. The Mega automatically defined the proper AT&T; APN settings and the 3G was working great. You will need a MICRO SIM for this phone. If you have a standard sized SIM you can either cut it down to MICRO SIM size or visit an AT&T; store and ask for a MICRO SIM.The Mega 6.3 GT i9200 will NOT work with ANY AMERICAN LTE (4G) frequency. In North America we use LTE frequencies 700, 800, 1900, 1700, 2100 MHz which are bands 4, 12, 13, 17, 25AT&T; uses BAND 4 and 17 Frequencies 1700/2100 for Band 4 and 700 for Band 17T-Mobile uses BAND 4 Frequencies 1700/2100 AWSThe i9200 has NO LTE radio so AT&T; 3G HSPA+ is all you will get with the GT i9200 here in the United States. You will get 2G on T-Mobile or 3.5G HSPA if you are in an area where T-mobile has refarmed their 1900 band. This phone isn't compatible with Verizon.******************************************************************************************************ATT subscribers may ask themselves why should they buy the full price unlocked phone versus the $99 on contract Mega 6.3 that AT&T; is currently offering? Well one major reason is that the AT&T; Mega 6.3 has a locked boot loader. If you don't know what that means then you should get your Mega 6.3 directly from AT&T.; However if you enjoy performing modifications to your phone such as rooting and flashing custom roms then the i9200 and i9205 are the only options you have with the Mega 6.3. You currently cannot root the AT&T; Mega 6.3, please be aware of this if you are thinking about purchasing directly from AT&T; and are hoping to root the AT&T; Mega 6.3*****************************************************************************************************If you purchase this unlocked international device from Amazon or any other online retailer and you live in the United States, Samsung will not warranty your phone. Buying an unlocked grey market phone that was not specifically released for your country (USA) is not eligible under Samsung's 1 year warranty. Please consider this before you purchase any unlocked international Samsung phones as they will not be covered under the Samsung warranty (It doesn't matter what the Amazon seller puts in the description about this). If you want a warranty from Samsung then either wait for your carrier (T-Mobile, AT&T; etc.) to carry the phone or purchase a 3rd party warranty from a vendor like Square Trade. You've been warned.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "YES five stars", "Author": "Thank you", "ReviewID": "R1DSVPXV8O9DPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Five stars just for the battery alone.  I used to have the droid razr and had to keep it plugged in constantly and keep the data and location services off or the phone literally drains within a couple of hours.  Taking it anywhere where I had no ability to plug in was useless and it would get extremely hot.  However in addition I have never had a phone of this quality.  Iphone shmyphone, this phone kicks all other phones ass.  I never purchased a tablet because it would be useless to me based on my lifestyle and personality.  I mostly text and talk, email and research. I not really heavy on the social networking thing.  So with this I have a great phone that will allow me to casually engage the internet as needed. I'm in love with this phone.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Size and Reception with Phone-Tablet Advantages", "Author": "christine", "ReviewID": "RK41M923WELCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "title:  Great size and receptionI think the size of this phone is terrific because the screen is large enough for easy, accurate typing and reading of websites, navigation, attachments, email, etc.  The screen clarity and colors are also great.  It fits easily into a small purse and of course in backpack or briefcase. It is light for its size.  I also find the T-Mobile reception I get with this phone is fine.  I have both phone and data plans.  The reception is as good as my Verizon reception was on my previous 4GLTE phone.  Another reviewer claimed one could only get 2G with T-Mobile on this phone and he was incorrect.  AT&T; also told me that I can use this unlocked phone with their sim card for AT&T; service.  This device is both a tablet and a phone, which is very convenient (I don't have to carry both devices) and it saves lots of money because you don't need to purchase two devices and more importantly, you don't need to pay the approximate $360 per year in extra data charges to your phone company for having data on both the phone and tablet.  The advantage of the unlocked phone is that there is no contract and if you wish you can save even more money by having no data plan and just use this smartphone  in WiFi for email and internet access while paying only basic phone charges to your carrier. Verizon does not allow users to have phone access on a Verizon locked smartphone without paying for a data plane. There is also the advantage that because this phone accepts a sim card that this phone can be used internationally and T-Mobile has very  low cost plans for international phone and data .  I have had this phone for about 2 months so these comments are based on experience.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely the best phone for the price", "Author": "Erb Avore \"Erb Avore\"", "ReviewID": "R2UKFZU9MV12W7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am amazed at this phone.Its like the 3 bears.Not too bigNot too smallIts JUST RIGHT!!!Just make sure that you a 2 handed texter.Also, be sure to get a keyboard such as \"perfect keyboard\"This will allow you to text extremely accurately and fast.The interals of the camera of good enough for anything needed.The only thing I liked more about my Note2 was the camera.The mega 6.3 camera is \"OK\" only.I give the phone a raving 5 stars for the price.Great job Samsung!", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Best Phone Ever!", "Author": "lanet A.", "ReviewID": "RWIF85OFW3Z26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first received my cell phone on November 14th I was impressed with the size of the phone.

I have a Samsung galaxy note 3 which is 5.7 inches and people say its a large phone but when put beside the Samsung galaxy mega 6.3 which is 6.3 inches it makes the note 3 look like a iPhone. It has a lot more screen real estate which is good for a types of media, movies, TV shows, games and ext. The only trade off with this phone and the note 3 is performance. The note has one the best CPU processors on the market the snapdragon 800 and the mega has the snapdragon 400 which is a mid level processor these days but delievers pretty decent enough performance to keep me happy and not use the note 3 as a daily driver which now sits in the box. I like the mega better than the note 3 because of the screen size even though its was the most powerful phone of 2013 but I prefer phones in the 6 inch range. The note 3 is just too small to me. That's just my opinion.

In my whole history of amazon this has never happened. I would never suggest anyone to buy from this unsure seller. i seen that another user has had issues with this seller before and im just wanting to put my experience into this as well. If your looking to buy something i would say just avoid this merchant and your much better off going somewhere else, unless you want to waste your money and have a huge headache.

Even with heavy use, watching videos, editing videos and other activities, the battery always lasts me the whole day.The only thing I've noticed about the screen is that if you have it tilted back a lot it's kind of hard to see (compared to the s3) but that is such a minor issue. You can see it just fine in the daylight (even better than s3).Yes, you can put it in your pocket. Several of the high school kids have challenge me. I've had them try and even the boys who wear the skinny jeans can fit it.Bought a prepaid SIM card for tmobile at Walmart and had it up and running in no time (no special adjustments needed). Wifi is fast.The only other negative I can think of is that I had to figure out how to change the language from French. Wish I could remember because then I could tell you guys. It's cool because it also came with an international power supply, so it will come in handy the next time I visit Italy.
