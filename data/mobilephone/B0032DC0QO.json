Absolutely unexcelled Bluetooth connectivity with anything other than my P.C. ~  Grabs my Intellitouch X Link (bluetooth) as soon as I pull into my drive..The bad (or less than `good'): Speaker phone may only be engaged AFTER call is initiated. Absolutely NO means of linking with PC by means of USB cable, no memory card capabilities anyway. VERY limited internal memory, P/C- Bluetooth connectability listed buy apparently not supported, I can't figure how to get the VERY LIMITED pictures out of the phone. `Recording' function apparently for phone dialogue only. Slippery, smooth  greasy feeling exterior may be negated by adding a \"rubberized\" snap-on  cover..Overall critique: For use as a cell phone VERY adequate, easy to use. For anyone wanting only a bare bones, easy to use cell phone, it's great! Has virtually none of the bling-bling non-phone features  most cell phone users seem to want now days.  Want a good, simple cell phone (only)?

He had been using a Motorola V195, but it suddenly stopped working after many years of faithful service. I was looking for a simple, easy to use phone similar to the V195, because he's not tech savvy, and for him, the simpler, the better. The Nokia 2720 S40 Flip fit the bill. An added bonus is that the call quality is much clearer on the 2720. It's a straightforward flip phone, with some nice features. In fact, after setting up his phone, I liked it so much, I bought one for myself, to replace a Samsung flip phone. But the 2720 I bought for myself came from WalMart, for $31/shipped site-to-store. The phones are similar, but not identical. I'll do my best to explain the differences below:To begin with, the Amazon 2720, even though it says \"US Version with Full Warranty\", does NOT come with a full US warranty from Nokia. The good folks at UnlockedCellPhoneKings, who filled the Amazon order, explained to me that ALL UNLOCKED CELL PHONES void the manufacturer's warranty! They also stated that Amazon writes the headings for the ad and they have no control over what Amazon writes. In terms of the warranty that does come with the Amazon 2720 -- THEY (UnlockedCellPhoneKings) provide their OWN warranty (in this case, a 1 year warranty). And while that's better than nothing, it is not the true full US warranty that comes with the WalMart pre-paid Nokia 2720. Furthermore, the WalMart prepaid 2720 comes in a sealed package, with the actual manual that's specific to the 2720. The 2720 that I got from UCPK's came was in a generic box with a generic manual. I called UCPK's to ask why, and they explained that they buy in bulk, then put together packages after they get an order. They claimed that the phones are brand new, but there's really no way of knowing that. I would suggest that if you buy one of these phones from Amazon, rather than from WalMart, you buy it from UnlockedCellPhoneKings -- they were a pleasure to deal with, and they have a toll free number.As far as the phone itself, I prefer the one from Amazon. It has certain options (i.e. it allows you to re-configure BOTH soft key pads, rather than just the left soft key pad), and the home page (the page you see when you first open the phone) has the time in a much bigger font than the WalMart 2720. But that's basically aesthetics, and each person's preferences are going to be different. In terms of actually using the phone, they're both easy to set up and easy to use. (I had read that some people felt the volume was too low when using the speakerphone. I think the reason is that the speakerphone does not use the same volume setting as the normal mode. You have to press the up volume button while you're on the speakerphone in order to increase the volume to a more audible level.) The only real drawback I found is that these phones are fingerprint magnets. I would suggest getting some inexpensive face plate covers (front and back), since they faceplates not only provide protection to the phone, but also they cut down considerably on the fingerprints.In terms of a simple, easy to use flip phone, the 2720 does a good job, and these types of basic phones are becoming harder and harder to find.  And while I like some of the features of the Amazon 2720 better than the WalMart 2720, for the price, I'd go with the WalMart 2720 for $31/shipped to the store. The one inconvenience, as another reviewer pointed out, is the fact that there's no USB outlet or removable memory card on the 2720, so even though it takes photos, there's no simple, direct way to GET the photos from the phone to your computer. There are two possible options. 1 is to get a USB Bluetooth dongle to plug into your computer. You then pair the phone with the computer (but not as a modem) and you can transfer files from the phone to the computer, or vise versa, IF you have the right software. (Nokia has 2 free software suites -- Nokia PC Suite (which is older), and Nokia OVI Suite. Even though PC Suite is older, a lot of users seem to prefer it to the newer OVI Suite. Both are available for free download on the Nokia site.)Another option is to get a USB SIM card reader. They work like memory card readers, and range in price from around $8 to $30. I read some reviews and the cheaper ones don't seem to work all that well. The one that seemed to get the highest reviews was the: Dekart SIM Card Reader + SIM Manager 2 software. Here's the Amazon link: http://www.amazon.com/Dekart-Card-Reader-Manager-software/dp/B0045BIUGG/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid;=1296592924&sr;=8-5. It can also be purchased directly from the Dekart site: [...](Personally, I find the shipping costs to be ridiculous from both places, but I was unable to find this item from any other source other than Amazon or Dekart directly.)(NOTE: I have T-Mobile, and the SIM cards from the old phones worked perfectly in both the Amazon 2720 and the WalMart 2720. I simply inserted the old SIM cards, synced them with the built-in phone address book memory, and was on my way. The folks at UCPK's explained that the 2720's that they sell are designed to work fully with T-Mobile. They will still work with AT&T;, but not all of the options will be fully operational. The ones from Walmart appear to be locked into T-Mobile, but I'm not 100% sure about that.)", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone for What it Is", "Author": "I Am Who I Am", "ReviewID": "RVAJZ24WDAQAQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bougtht this from AT&T; as an 8 dollar Go phone with 0 minutes. I asked AT&T; for the unlock code (they will provide it with proof of purchase from them), and popped my old sim card in. For 8 dollars, this is a great phone. It gets better reception than my old Motorola V190 where I live, and it has bluetooth. Bluetooth is important to me because my state recently banned cell phone use in cars except for handsfree. It is only dual band, so don't buy if you need a quad band. Battery life is decent, and the phone is easy to use. The key press could be better, but it is not a deal breaker nor inadequate in any way. The instruction manual is poor, and it doesn't document all the features. For example, there is a speaker phone, but is is not even mentioned in the manual. The button for it activates once you have made a call. If you play with the keys, you will find all the features. The camera, at 1.3 mega pixels is not great, but I expected that. One nice feature is being able to back up the phone and transfer files to/from a pc via bluetooth using Nokia's free PC Suite software and a $2.95 bluetooth usb adapter from ebay. The phone has a calendar to which you can add appointments, birthdays and the like. You can also add contact info such as address. I don't think the phone has a lot of memory so I don't know how much you can store. By contemporary phone standards, this is a pretty basic phone. For 8 dollars, it was an incredible bargain, and I am quite happy with it. I have an old, original AT&T; plan, and the only way I can get a new phone from AT&T; is to move to a new (more expensive) plan.

So I was looking for a phone that has just the basics - good battery life, good reception, and be able to accept my SIM card and pay as you go plan. I was recommended this by a friend and am finally glad to be able to own a phone that has all that I ask of it!First off, battery life. It's been literally a week since I've charged it and it's only gone down one bar (out of four)! I've made several calls on it, dozens more texts, and it's still going strong!The call reception is fantastic. I can clearly hear the other caller and often have to turn the volume down on the speaker.It's a very durable phone. Because it folds in half, you don't have to worry about locking the keypad, and the overall design means it can take being dropped more than once (as I've accidentally done twice) and still be in fine working condition. It's also a pleasing sleek black design with a screen on the front which lights up when you've closed the phone to display the time and anyone calling.The buttons are large and responsive which makes texting a breeze. It's also got internet capability, a camera, and all the little pieces you'd expect (alarm clock, calculator, games, etc.) but compared to Smart phones, it's very basic.But basic is what I wanted. I wanted a phone that can make and answer calls, and send the occasional text and function as an alarm clock. This phone does all that, and very well too. If you're looking for this plus superb battery life, this is the phone for you. I've got no regrets at all and am very pleased with it.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Item doesn't match website", "Author": "Barrelbank", "ReviewID": "R2CVFW8VU4OD20", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I tried to order the correct phone twice and both times it came in with a TMobile connection.

The inside and outside displays are bright and clear.  It is two months old now.  Assuming that it holds up, if she breaks it or looses it, I will probably buy another just like it.My only complaint is that the microphone suffers from the weird problem that cheap cell phones tend to have - that noises originating from 10-15 feet away from the phone come through much louder than the voice of the person holding the phone.

The phone itself sucks, it is very difficult to hear anyone or for anyone to hear me while speaking on it. The cover on the back that goes over the battery is a thin flimsy piece of plastic which constantly falls off while in my pocketbook and the battery falls out. The camera on it is horrible, I had less expensive phones that had much better picture quality then this phone. Another thing is when you want to get back to main screen simply closing phone won't do it. You have to push end several times to get back to main screen.

The biggest complaint I have about the phone is it's apparent power application problem,  case in point when I turned on the phone to call a friend after just three minutes maybe less the phone turns off on its own.  I checked and rechecked to make sure I didn't accidentally turn off the phone by mistake,  but after trying another call the same damn thing happened again.  Also a few times the sound wouldn't work, meaning the other person who you were talking to either couldn't hear you or your couldn't hear them either way it became a true annoyance.  Another thing I just didn't like about this model was its design and weight,  I just got a LG 420g flip phone and the versatility and weight difference is astounding as well as the LG phone seeming to have a much better and sleeker design then this model I felt.  I can't say this is the problem with all the phones of this model but still after having to deal with this headache for about three weeks I've just given up on the damn thing and have gone back to my previous phone as that one has so far never let me down...", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Too much static, people can only hear every other word.", "Author": "gadgetGirl", "ReviewID": "RE6LCWBX9KI7E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "They say you get what you paid for and this phone is just that.

I constantly had problems with dropped calls, poor call quality, etc...  The SGH-T109, which I was still using and still works, also had a very poor headset which I lost.  The replacement headset was even worse.  See my review at Wireless Solutions Earbud for Samsung SGH-T929 Memoir, SGH-A877 Impression, SGH-T119, SGH-T109.The SGH-T109 reception got so bad I finally had to replace it with this Nokia 2720 S40 unlocked phone.  I had previously called T-Mobile and they wanted me to sign a contract for another 2 years for yet another Samsung phone and, for some reason which I am not sure why, another SIM card.  BTW, I bought the Samsung T139 Prepaid Phone (T-Mobile) as a gift for someone else and it has the same problem, poor reception.  WHEN is Samsung going to make a basic flip-phone which has better reception?I took a chance and bought this Nokia 2720 S40 unlocked phone and it works... basically.  Now instead of having no bars, at least I get 1 or 2 bars and the other party can understand me.  The Nokia is also a better looking phone with silver buttons and a blue case.  Unfortunately, the Nokia, compared to the Samsung, has a strange menu system where it is difficult to find basic setup commands or the settings don't exist at all.  Also, when I have the phone open, the timed backlight goes off and when I press any button to make it go back on, the button registers on the phone as a command, forcing me to exit whatever I entered.  I find this most irritating.There is no mention of a headset on the Amazon description page but a wired headset is included.  The Nokia wired headset is better than Samsung's with clearer sound.  All I need is a basic cellphone.  I don't need a worthless, lousy, 1.3 megapixel cellphone camera since I already have a Canon PowerShot SX210IS 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 14x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black).  I'm not going to pay megabucks to access the Internet with my phone because I have a laptop and a desktop for that.  When I'm traveling, if I want to access the 'Net, I can get FREE access using my laptop and WiFi at most motels, many coffee shops, and many small restaurants.  I also do not use texting because I don't want to pay 15\u00a2 per spam message.  I use FREE emails instead.I hope this Nokia will last for at least 3 years.  I'll never go back to Samsung cells again.  I doubt Samsung will ever get their act together regarding basic flip-phones.  BTW, Samsung doesn't really like even remotely, partially (3/5 star) negative reviews of their products so they don't always post them on their own website. They like positive, happy, reviews.

Good form factor, nice super-sized display numbers when dialing, good front display to see who's calling.

It has the 3.5mm socket for my headset, instead of the proprietary  connector.  Phone uses Bluetooth for my car - another must-have.
