I'm not into smart phones or texting phones, so it's hard to find flip phones that are in great condition. This phone is perfect though. Great camera, great sound and voice quality, and it's shock and water safe. If you have a Samsung Flipshot and are trying to upgrade it, go for this one. Buy from JustCellular BTW.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Phone!", "Author": "KernersvilleMom", "ReviewID": "RY5QE02AOWNP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to use.  Easy to keep looking new!  It doesn't scratch easily.  Requires no extra data plan with Verizon.Nice looking photographs.  Great for texting. Wonderful phone!I purchased this phone for my son because it offered not only the features he wanted but, also, a low SAR rating -My criteria. Little did I know what a perfect phone it would be for a 15 year old young man!  Wow!  Rough, rugged, keeps a good charge, and....He has washed and dried it twice in the pocket of his jeans, and it took a dive with him when he was pushed into the pool.  (After the dunking, it was still powered on and working. Amazing. He turned it off, took out the battery, and dried it by placing it in a baggie of dried rice for a day.) The interior of the battery compartment never showed moisture.  Now, while I can't guarantee such satisfaction for you, I can say that it has been a PERFECT phone for him!  Wow!It was definitely MONEY WELL-SPENT for me!  :-D  (Knowing how many other phones he has been through...lol)", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "More of a thank you than a review", "Author": "B. Hennessy", "ReviewID": "R2CV06UTH8U89L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this phone, from a brand new activation at a Verizon store, for almost four years now. I remember thinking when I got it that it seemed cheap, light, and plasticky. It has lasted more than twice as long as any other cell phone I have owned to this date. It still has the original battery, that still holds a useful charge for a full day with heavy use, two days or more with light use, even after four years. The camera still works today like the day I got it, with a nice clear lens despite four years of pocked wear and dozens of drops. I have put it through the washing machine (though not the dryer) and it came out with not a hiccup. Didn't even bother with the whole rice thing. Just toweled it off and put it back in my pocket. It has been under a flooded house with me while plumbing, where my work phone (a rugedized Motorola) came out with water damage right away, and the Casio was unaffected.I have taken and saved thousands of pictures and hundreds of movies with it, most memorably in Kauai. My pictures of sunset at Kee'ee lagoon stand up pretty damn well to ones taken by a friend on a high end SLR (at Facebook resolution anyway).It is getting to the point where a smart phone of some sort is probably unavoidable in my near future. I really don't want to though, since I want to see exactly how long this thing will go. The Casio engineers really outdid themselves on this one.Nokias have the reputation of being indestructible. This phone really gives them a run for the money, while also being just a great quality phone and camera. So thank you to the Casio engineers and manufacturers, I more than got my money's worth out of this phone.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone, but it only holds 500 contacts and verizon no longer supports this phone because it is several years old", "Author": "Dean Pearson", "ReviewID": "RDG3HD3LQRLXU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Only holds 500 contactsverizon no longer supports this phone because it its an older phone.I had to manual install most of my contacts", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "One of the best basic phones ever made", "Author": "N.

I can't say the camera is wonderful like the phone but it's good since you can put a micro SD card in it.The best thing about this phone to me is that I don't have to wait for the menu to load or things I click on to load like my other dinky phone. Pretty convenient to have the phone sorta transform into a camera and a video camera as well. It makes either \"message\" videos or some other type of video, I forget what it's called. those are a little better quality and a lot bigger so not as many will fit on the actual phone which is where the SD card comes into play.This phone has ALWAYS worked and has great, clear sounding calls. Everything on this phone has always worked. when i get an upgrade I will be getting another one.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Impressed", "Author": "D_Review", "ReviewID": "R1KHTU0HVAIGGI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received phone very quickly and in good shape.

I really do wish it worked though because it's a cool idea for a phone. For one, a picture was sent to this phone from an iphone, and the memory just couldn't handle it. The preview page in My Pictures froze up every time, and when I tried deleting the picture from the Memory tab under Phone Settings, it couldn't delete it either.
