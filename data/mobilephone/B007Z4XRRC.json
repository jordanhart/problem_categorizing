{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awful- Don't waste your money.", "Author": "Chloe", "ReviewID": "R2EQKHI3Y7ORWN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't waste your money. That's all I really have to say. I don't think I've ever had a phone that works this horribly.Before I say anything else, I've had this phone less than a year. Probably 4-5 months.>Turning the phone on.If you want to turn the phone back on, you better be prepared to wait. The touch takes 4-5 seconds to respond to ANYTHING when you turn it on. This includes typing, opening any applications, and literally anything else.Not only does it lag with every single thing once it turns on, if you plan to send a quick message- keep dreaming. When you turn the phone back on, whether you turned it off yourself or the battery died, for the first 10-15 minutes, when you're opening messaging, it will \"Initialize\" every time. No matter how you do it- Going to the menu, or creating a new message from the home screen. Always initializing for 10-15 minutes. This goes for almost any application, but messaging is specifically the one that takes the longest.>Touch ScreenUnless you have pen cap with you, good luck with the touch screen. It will hardly respond to your finger- you need to have a stylus or even fingernails in order to use it SOMEWHAT easily. In other words, if you're looking for an iPod/iPhone-like (AKA actual) touchscreen, you're in the wrong place.>Mobile WebLet's just say this barely even counts as mobile web-browsing. Most sites are completely jumbled and out-of-order- that is, if they even load. 9 times out of 10, when you're making an attempt to get to a site, the connection fails. Try a connection test? Oh, connection's fine. Continue trying- it'll take you at least 10 tries to get to the site. If you're attempting to log in anywhere, don't expect much. I've had to go through 3 different mobile versions of one site before I was able to log in. Not to mention, it would have been nice if it saved usernames/passwords, but of course not. The loading time for any and all site is awful, the mobile viewing is even worse, and it's just a general frustration.>App StoreJust.. wow. Not much to say here except it's extremely limited with it's apps and horrendously overpriced. Most games are between $5-$8 a month. Including games that are free on Google Play, iTunes, etc. As for limited apps, I hope you're not expecting to get any of the popular games from the iTunes store. I can almost promise you they won't be there- or they'll be horridly priced.>Physical / Cosmetic DurabilitySee that nice, sparkly blue? Hope you don't want it for long. The colouring on it chips away within the first week- Leaving it with the cheap plastic it's made of to be chipped, scratched, dented, you name it. Not that it wasn't that cheaply made in the first place. Also, the touchscreen. I don't think they could have spent less money. It's the cheapest plastic touchscreen you can find on a phone. Within a few weeks of gentle use, the screen is scratched to the point where it's hard to even see it.>AccessoriesDon't expect to find a case, for one. Don't expect to listen to music with it, either. Of all things, there's no headphone jack. There's a music app, but no headphones. Not to mention, the speakers sound awful and are ridiculously quiet. Calling it a phone and MP3 player is beyond a load of s***.Just.. Don't do it. Instead, go flush $60 down the toilet. It'll be less of a waste than buying this \"phone.\"", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent phone.", "Author": "Sean Banankhah \"Sean the Realtor\"", "ReviewID": "RZK8Q9DMKL5PE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This isn't anywhere near smartphone quality but no one should expect that on regular phones. This phone has decent call quality, its surprisingly  sturdy since I dropped it on cement on a 2 story building and it worked fine afterward. Has a microSD card slot.

I use it mainly for calls and texting. I am not required to have a media package through AT&T; using this phone, but I could have one if I wanted.  I recommend buying a phone case to protect it as well as the screen protectors.  The battery lasts several days for me and I like the touch screen feature. The key board can sometimes be cumbersome, but overall it gets the job done. The operating systems does seem to hesitate at times. I live in a rural area and get reception in 99% of the places I go. Occasionally, if I am in a large building, the reception is weakened.
