Beautiful, sometimes feels a little \"washed out\", but is quite sharp while playing videos.Battery - 2300 mAh, only lasts me 6-7 hours of screen-on time.  Lasts the entire day if I stay off the phone and pay attention in class... standby time lasts me all day.Camera - Wish the shutter speed was faster, but I'm not a heavy camera user unless I'm sight-seeing or at a concert.  Optical Image Stabilizing makes a huge difference.  GREAT video recording!!!  The mic picks up all the audio perfectly at a concert.Speakers - Probably the worst part of the phone if you're watching a YouTube video with a friend.  Located at the very bottom of the phone, the real speaker is located behind the left holes, and the right holes are \"fake speakers\".  If you cover the left holes, the sound will be muted.  However, 95% of the time I'm using my earbuds to listen to my own music, so it's not a big deal.Design - Feels great in the hands, and the soft-touch back just feels sturdy and easy to grip.  Goes to show you don't need an aluminum metal casing around the phone for it to feel like a quality phone.  The ceramic power and volume buttons are nice and add to the solid experience.  However, I prefer to have the volume jack on the bottom of the phone, but it is easy to get used to.Processor - Snapdragon 800 is extremely buttery.  Everything runs fine with all my apps and data imported (Galaxy Nexus got laggy).  Google Now is quick to use.Software:Android Kit Kat 4.4 - Best experience of the phone.  It's the real reason anybody would purchase an Android phone, especially from Google.  Google Now and the Google Experience makes everything so efficient and is very user friendly.  It syncs everything within your Google account, taking your contacts, locations, sports teams, bookmarks, Chrome searches, etc. and keeps everything up to date.  A pure Google experience that anyone would love.The always-on Google search feature delivers fast & accurate searches that beat our household iPhone Siri every time.Overall:Easily the best Android phone on the market, and you really cannot contend with a $350/$400 Google phone.  The very small shortcomings of the speaker, and itty bitty detail of the camera is almost negligible.  This pure Android experience is for everyone.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best High End Phone Deal In America?", "Author": "D.L.C", "ReviewID": "R397PM4P6DG439", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a long time Nexus brand user, owning the first generation Nexus 7 and Nexus 4. I also have an iPad 3 and an iPod Touch 4th generation. I wrote a lengthy Nexus 7 review before; here is my lengthy Nexus 5 review updated after over a month of straight usage. It should cover the vast majority of topics on the device. Let's get started on what possibly is the best high end phone deal in America.(1) Hardware:Personally, in my opinion, high to medium end devices from reputable brands have reached the point where most people won't be able to tell the difference or the difference won't be something they regularly use. That said, I'm still going to cover it, if you're not interested in the nerd talk about hardware, then all you need to know is that the phone is capable hardware wise for demanding users and honestly overkill for average users. Skip this section of my review and head on down to the camera portion.The device is built on a Qualcomm S800 Pro processor. Clocked at 2.2 GHz quadcore processor, the phone screams on speed. I'm not a fan of mobile benchmarks due to their inherent problems of actually measuring what they claim, but benchmarks all put the Nexus 5 at the moment in the top end of performance. Compared to my Nexus 7's Tegra 3, the Nexus 5 has a fighter jet engine compared to the first generation Nexus 7's turboprop engine.There's also a Hynix 2 GB RAM chip running at DDR3 1600 Mhz, and either a 16 GB or 32 GB Sandisk NAND memory chip depending which model you bought. Google is charging $50 more for the 32 GB device. That's about a 625% markup over wholesale NAND prices. Take that as you will.There are Bluetooth, NFC, GPS and unlike the Nexus 4, a slim-port compatibility, thus letting you connect the phone to a monitor or television screen. LG/Google kept the wireless charging from the Nexus 4, to which the wireless charger has to be purchased separately.The phone comes with an Adreno 330 graphics chip. I'm not a big mobile gamer, but this per the professional reviews and FPS benchmarks will handle every game out for Android. For non-gamers, the Adreno 330 is overkill.Microphone and talk clarity are on par with Nexus 4, meaning fine. Speaker seems to have more noise at higher volumes. Also, speaker is mono despite there being two grills at the bottom. One grill is for the microphone.Connects via standard USB, where the device itself has a microUSB connection. Plugging the device into your computer brings it up as another removable storage device where you can simply drop and drag files into folders. Easy file movement plus standard USB makes the device very simple to use and standard charging conventions make it easy to find chargers around your house and office. Sometimes the device goes wonky on USB connection (was a Nexus 4 issue as well), so just go into settings and storage, click on the settings (3 vertical boxes) and change the connection to PTP or MPT and the phone will reappear properly.Like all recent Nexus devices, no MicroSD slot and no removable battery. MicroSD slot is partially alleviated now that USB OTG works. See my \"other\" section for more details.You can find these specific parts on iFixit's tear down which gave it a solid 8/10 for user repair. For the low price of $349/$399, there is no other phone with this quality hardware that for the price.Right now, due to shortages in supply, many people are scalping the phones for profit. If you can wait, the phone will ship between 2 and 4 weeks and if the Nexus 4 timeline tells us anything, quickly reach the point where it's under a week. My phone took a little under 3 weeks to deliver from ordering it on the 1st of November.(2) Camera:The back camera is still an 8 megapixel and front is 1.3 megapixel, same as the Nexus 4. Low light has improved considerable and HDR+ alleviates many of lighting problems. HDR is a software/hardware combination that takes three photos, one underexposed, one overexposed and one regular and the software combines them to even out the lighting issues to produce the best possible shot. Graininess has been reduced as well. Google keeps the same minimal interface for the camera with the select and drag method for changing options.Image stabilization is so-so and the camera can be slow to focus at times. The Nexus 5 camera is an improvement over the Nexus 4, but a Lumia this is not.  Google released updates to the Android OS that had specific Nexus 5 camera fixes. The camera's improved, but it's still relatively slow at focusing. However, image quality has improved considerably as have night shots. The only real criticism now is that the camera is slow to focus.(3) Android 4.4 - Operating System:Google's latest and greatest is on display here. Android 4.4, otherwise known as Kitkat comes pre-installed on the phone. There are some changes from Android 4.3 Jelly bean. Like all Nexus devices, operating system updates are done over the air via Google. No waiting on device manufacturers or carriers.The launcher has changed and on the Nexus 5 (and it's exclusive to the Nexus 5), and widgets are now removed from the app screen and are accessed by pressing and holding down on a home screen.Icon sizes have been enlarged in the app library, and formatting has been tweaked.Android Run Time (ART) is now available as opposed to the stock Google Dalvik compiler. Allegedly, ART nets a handful more hours out of the device per some reviews, but I haven't noticed any difference. In theory, ART should speed up the device, but with the S800 Pro already blazing fast, it's questionable if anyone will notice, your mileage will vary. Also, some apps are broken under ART.Google has prominently placed Google search on the top of the phone and included the new function of simply talking to your phone to have it fulfill requests. Simply say \"Ok Google\" and the Google Now function loads up where you can ask questions or request information simply by talking to it. Phone has to be unlocked for it to work as opposed to the Moto X which I believe will work without unlocking.Hangouts has merged with text messaging for a combined app. As with all Android phones, you can download another app and make it your default over Hangouts. Currently the Hangouts change in my opinion was a mistake. Group texting via SMS has problems with sending, the app prioritizes sending to Gmail accounts over SMS and you can't mix SMS and Gmail group chats together. The separation in 4.3 was a better system.Google kept the Sywpe like typing option on its default keyboard (drag your fingers between keys rather than typing) and notification center appears to be the same from 4.3. Colors however for notification went from blue to white. Also the notification flashing light is still there from the Nexus 4. It's sort of like the Blackberry's red flashing LED, but at the bottom.Outside of the changes from 4.3, stock Android 4.3, stock meaning there's no \"skin\" over it such as Touchwiz or HTC's Sensation, runs extremely fast. Apps load instantly, everything is extremely responsive. This is not Android Honeycomb that was an unresponsive lag filled mess. It is however, less intuitive than iOS 6/7. Android verse Apple has always been like this and its personal preference. That said, if you're in to nearly complete customization, widgets, lock screen information and generally busting out of a walled garden to have your phone do what you want it to do, this is your cup of tea.(4) Battery Life:The battery life on the Nexus 5 is better than the Nexus 4. A slight boost of 200 mAh to 2,300 from 2,100 mAh is minor and it appears the gains are from the operating system primarily. Some user are reporting with ART, they can last a full day as opposed to 16 to 17 hours on Dalvik, some users are reporting the same battery life.After more than a month of the usage on the device, I find that battery life is generally superior to the Nexus 4 and going a whole day is not a problem. This isn't a Note 3 that will last all day gaming. Mileage will vary depending on your behavior.The biggest killer of battery aside from constant gaming is using LTE in an area with weak LTE signal. The phone (like all phones) will eat up huge amounts of battery trying to maintain the bad signal. Sometimes it will drain 20% of my battery in an hour or two on standby. Switching to 3G as the primary network reduces standby usage to a few percent over two or three hours.(5) Build & Looks:The phone comes in two colors, black and white. Note that the white version does not extend the white to the front; it's just the back panel.The phone is fairly light and considerably lighter than the Nexus 4. It is still a black rectangle like most smartphones. LG/Google have forgone the glass backing from the Nexus 4. This should significantly reduce real damage as the soft plastic backing is far less susceptible to shattering like glass. The phone is a bit thinner than the Nexus 4.Screen is 4.95 inches, with confirmed Gorilla Glass 3. The phone is using IPS which gives better clarity and color than the Nexus 4. Resolution is set at 1,920-by-1,080 pixel for a 445 pixel density (PPI). I'd still use a screen guard as the face drop test reveals that Gorilla Glass 3 is good for preventing scratches, but so-so to horrendously bad on impact resistance.Side bezels are very minimal, but the top and bottom bezels are still large. Overall, it's not going to wow people upon first look, but most of us are here for performance and pure Android, what excites us is now how a phone looks, but what we can do with it.(6) LTE & Carrier Support:Google is selling these phones completely unlocked, meaning that you can go to any carrier that supports its bands and it should work.Unlike the Nexus 4, the Nexus 5 is LTE enabled. This was a huge reason for me to get the Nexus 5 as I'm paying for T-Mobile's LTE on the simple plan but I wasn't able to access it. My local HSPA+ was topping out around 11 Mbp/s in the heart of Honolulu to a paltry 4 Mbp/s in my house away from the heart of the city. LTE has pushed urban speed to over 30 Mbp/s (per my last test) and my house to over 9 Mbp/s. Your mileage will of course vary.Nexus 5's LTE will work with bands on T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T.; Verizon has some LTE bands that the Nexus 5 doesn't support and Verizon and Google have some ideological issues that are preventing them from working together on the Nexus line. T-Mobile is selling the device non-subsidized at a $100 markup financed over 24 months at 0%. Sprint is selling the phone subsidized at $49 but you'll pay it all back and more through subsidy recovery fees built into the monthly bill. AT&T; isn't selling the device but will support BOYD Nexus 5. Be aware though, unless you're on AT&T;'s prepaid Aio service, you're still going to be paying for subsidy recovery fees even though you didn't get a subsidy from AT&T.;A lot of people don't seem to understand that the amount they pay for the phone on day one, usually $199 is not the total price they pay for the phone. That's the down payment. AT&T;/Sprint/Verizon and previously T-Mobile recover their subsidy via the fees they charge in their monthly. T-Mobile and other non-contract carriers have broken out of this model and give a dosage of transparency to monthly billings as to what is service fee and what is subsidy recovery. If you buy an unlocked phone from Google and take it to T-Mobile, you will not be charged a device fee. If you take it to Verizon/AT&T;/Sprint outside of their prepaid options, you will be charged a device fee even though you did not get a subsidy. This will vastly increase the total price you pay for your phone. Keep that in mind.The best deal for this phone if you don't talk much is T-Mobile's $30 a month plan for 100 minutes, unlimited text and 5 GB of LTE, unlimited 3G. Download Google Voice for data calling if you need more talk time. For two years of service, that's $1,069 in total monthly and phone bills. That's less than the cost of 10 months of Verizon.If you're looking at other plans, Apple has done an extremely fantastic job of comparing AT&T;, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile's myriad plans into a single nice webpage. Google \"iPhone Plans Comparison\" for the best simple comparison of American big carrier plans. Apple labels these \"iPhone Plans\" but they are generic smartphone plans that anyone on any compatible device can purchase.(7) Other:Unlike the Nexus 4, USB Hosting OTG works. I personally don't find this that important, considering that OTG is a hassle on a device that's constantly on the move, but it is a big change from the Nexus 4 which didn't apply sufficient voltage to power USB Hosting. If you're wondering what USB Hosting/OTG is, USB Hosting and \"On The Go\" lets a phone or tablet to plug in a USB device in and let the device via the right program access the storage on the USB device. I'm currently using the Nexus Media Importer (as I previously bought that for the Nexus 7) as it lets me do this without rooting. I was never a big memory user on my Nexus 4, but I know some people are. Google \"Meenova\" for a more compact design that will let you access MicroSD cards on your Nexus 5. See my picture in the photo gallery.When I first started the phone up, Google play strangely tried to download and install every app I'd previous bought. What gives? I had to manually stop the install of certain apps.Sound quality via headphones is solid, but depends also on the quality of your headphones/earphones. Sound on the speaker is relatively low.Rooting is available now and there are a few ROMs for the Nexus 5 if you wish to play around.Accessories are flooding Amazon as well as eBay for relatively affordable prices. I'm using the [AIR CUSHION] Spigen Google Nexus 5 Case ULTRA HYBRID [Black] [1 FREE Premium Japanese Screen Protector + 2 FREE Graphics] Anti-Scratch Bumper Case with Clear Back Panel for Nexus 5 - ECO-Friendly Package - Black (SGP10609), but I'm not entirely happy as the flush buttons make it hard to use one handed as opposed to my RINGKE FUSION for Google Nexus 4 Best Selling Shock Absorption Bumper + Anti Scratch Clear Back Premium Hybrid Case [Eco/DIY Pkg.][BLACK].Personally, I do love Android. I can simply turn my phone on, look at my lock screen at the Dashclock Widget and see how many texts I have, emails, weather notifications Facebook notifications and so on without having to unlock my phone. I can also turn on GPS, silence my phone, the flash light on and other functions from my lock screen too. The Nexus 5 gives me a great affordable option.(8) Conclusion:The Nexus 5 has some drawbacks, adequate camera, no MicroSD slot, no removable battery and lacking some of Verizon's LTE bands. It does provide a blazing fast processor, roaring graphics chip, an extremely stock version of Android, thin and light design for a very affordable unlocked price. And it's Sprint capable. Android does take some time to learn, but it offers nearly complete customization. For $349 and a dose of willingness to learn, you can't go wrong here.TLDR: Blazing fast smartphone, okay camera, no bloatware, no Verizon, unlocked and just $349~399.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Device But buy from Play Store", "Author": "Kushal Joshi", "ReviewID": "RXL6B5NX0ELST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "12/21/13 Update:So about 2 weeks ago Nexus 5 users received the 4.4.2 update, it brought many small improvements but the greatest being improving the camera.

It comes with the latest version of pure android and should always get future upgrades first and has very good hardware specs.  It's kind of like a Galaxy S4 done right.  It doesn't come with all the really bad software Samsung, Carriers and others put on top of android. It is very fast and android 4.4 kitkat adds some nice updates.  The phone itself is rather plain looking, feels great in the hand and has a very nice display.  The ceramic buttons feel premium over the other phones i used.  I think the standout on this device is the specs and the software, which are top notch.  The display, camera and battery life are very good while not being the best on any phone. Everything else about this phone and this phone as a whole package seems to be the best.  I am very happy with it.  I've used the note 2, galaxy s4, nexus 4, iphone 5s and moto x for extended amounts of time.  The only other phone in the group I would consider is the moto x, if u have a preference for something smaller.  But compared to the rest I've used the Nexus 5 is the better choice.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "My favorite phone", "Author": "Morphling", "ReviewID": "R18P9Q921YET1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nexus 5 is the best Nexus yet and one of the best phones at that.  I've had mine for approximately a week and couldn't be happier.  I got the white one and think it looks fantastic.  With that note, let's get into a review and we'll start on build quality:The build - the phone is solidly built and light too - I personally like a heaver phone being a man with larger hands.  So, if you like lighter phones and find others too bulky, this may be refreshing for you.  Some professional reviews state the phone is good or mediocre build at best which is patently false.  Yes, there's a seam on this phone, especially owning a white version but it isn't some huge gap that's ugly or a place where you can push the two pieces together more.  The phone has no creaks at all and the glass is flush on all sides.  I mention the glass because I've owned Motorola, HTC, and even iPhones where the glass at the edge isn't even across the whole device and it drives me nuts.  The new buttons are ceramic - ohhh!  They are nice and work well.  The sim card tray is next to the power button but I haven't noticed it at all searching for the button as it's very flush with the phone. There isn't an SD card slot on this phone - get over it.  32GB is enough for MOST users.  If you are truly a power user who needs to swap out 64GB cards frequently for whatever reasons (I know some of you do exist) this isn't the phone for you.  I'm sorry, the Nexus devices haven't had one in a long time and it's a cost saving measure too.Next is connectivity and calling - the main point of a phone, right?  I won't discuss specific networks as that opens up a whole different debate that entire forums can't solve!  LTE works screaming fast on the phone and it holds onto the signal well.  HSPA+ is a beast on this phone too if your area doesn't have it.  Calls connect well and nothing has dropped so far.  The call quality is decent, which is a bummer as I'm one who still talks a lot on their phone.  I haven't tried any HD voice features yet so that may help the issue.  Wifi works well on the phone too both with 5ghz and 2.4ghz - my older router doesn't have all the latest standards but the phone supports any wifi you'll encounter.  I'll point out that my house is an old one with huge blocks that love to cancel out any cell signals.  This phone holds onto them and keeps them unlike other phones I've used on the same network.Screen - The best I've used.  I have grown tired of the Samsung AMOLED screens and favor the route Apple and HTC and now LG have taken, for the most part.  It's super crystal clear and even being a near-sighted blind person, I can't pick out pixels for the first time.  Colors are pretty accurate and everything is great looking.  The touch portion of the screen is great too with no issues.  It works as well as any other top tier phone.  Now 'for the most part' means I do notice this screen, as any LCD, cannot do true black unlike AMOLED.  It's a feature left to that technology alone but it doesn't detract here as the screen is great and you don't notice unless you have a competing phone next to it.Battery - It's average on this phone.  It isn't a beast like I've had on some Moto phones but it isn't a junker like some Samsung devices I've used too.  After the first couple days, it evened out and with moderate use I can make it to 10pm bed-time.  It isn't going to blow you away but it isn't the worst out there either.  I'd have liked an option to use a removable battery as I don't mind a heavier device or battery - but clearly we are going to wafer light and thin devices.Camera - It's a good camera to me and leaps and bounds better than any past phone I've owned including other Nexus devices.  Pictures come out clear and the HDR+ feature is pretty good as well.  Pictures come out sharper and it even works well trying to take a picture of my moving baby.  I can still tell it was taken with a phone vs. a stand-alone camera, but it's way more sufficient for my wants than I need.  The wife takes the serious pictures, I just take pictures of things to make sure I bought the right item.  So, if you aren't a budding photographer, this thing works well and even captures moving people well enough.Software - The new KitKat 4.4 is here and overall I love it more than the last version, just like I do with every android release.  I won't give a comprehensive review of the OS here, but I'll touch on some things.  Google added some developer options on this phone that you can enable as an option that make it scream.  It moves faster than I can use it now and this is a great step for any phone OS.  I've used Windows Phone 8 and many flavors of iOS and many versions of Android.  This is by far my favorite OS now, hands down.  MS has done well with 8, but this blows that out of the water now.  iOS 7 has veered off to me and I personally don't like it.  Anyway, this thing is fast!  Google now is better than ever, but I had to turn it off as it sucked battery down.  I hope Google addresses this as the service is awesome.  Hangouts is cool that everything is in one spot, but it's clunky to use for SMS and everything.  I wish google would have waited until everything in hangouts was totally done before merging, but they at least give you the option to download another SMS program and set it as the default now.  You have got to love choices.  Default email is better now and Gmail and calendar are excellent as ever.  Overall it's a pleasant step forward and hardly anything I don't like.That's a basic review of the phone and I'll end with the overall value and point of the phone.  Here on this great online retailer, the phone appears to cost more.  You can easily go to the source, if available in your country, and purchase it for an incredibly great price.  It is completely unlocked so you don't have to fiddle with buying an unlock code, which in the USA is now shady anyway, and waste more time and money.  This phone also will get updates quickly without hassles or being left in the dust instantly.  It's also priced at a mid-tier value, for almost all top tier specs and experiences.  I think many pro-reviewers have worried that things like the camera or battery aren't toe to toe with other phones, but those do cost more.  The bigger issue they miss is Android on this phone is unlike it on any other phone.  That's worth something too and what I stress is the most important thing about this phone.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "The right kind of Android phone at the right time", "Author": "J.S. \"road runner\"", "ReviewID": "RSD8PXA6BLU04", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In a year filled with all kinds of top-tier phones (Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, HTC One, LG G2, Moto X, Sony Xperia Z1, Oppo N1), it's a nice problem to have for any Android consumer or tech enthusiast. My first Android device was an HTC/Google Nexus One, and maybe it's because of that phone that got me sold on Android. I've tried various iterations of the Android OS (with Sense, with TouchWiz, Blur, etc.), but I would keep gravitating to the pure, stock Android experience that I got with my Nexus One. Even flashing a custom ROM on my last phone (Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket) still left me wanting. So, I then looked at the landscape, and after going back and forth on what I want out of a phone, I ended going with the Nexus 5.Why do you ask? It has all the features I expect out of the phone, and on top of it, getting (and receiving updates straight from Google) the latest Android OS. Sure, other phones may be better than the Nexus 5 at one aspect or another, but for one reason or another, each of the other phones are missing something that's a deal-breaker for me. This phone has all the aspects I want, and it does it either good enough or better. Newest OS? Check. Seamless Google Now? Check. Blazingly fast UI? Check. Beautiful, more \"natural\" display? Check. Solid (it doesn't have to be spectacular) camera for photos and videos? Check. Battery life (again, at least 3/4 to a full day's worth)? Check. Understated, clean design? Check. Easily modifiable (unlocking, rooting, etc.) for the tinkerer in me? Ditto. Unique, as in you won't see this all over the place (I've had strangers ask me about this phone)? Ditto.There's been detractors out there, but I feel that alot of it is being too nit-picky about what to expect out of a phone.

The delightful, but underrated and underpowered, Palm Pre, several Samsung Galaxy phones, most recently the Galaxy Nexus.The Nexus 5 blows them all away.  It is blindingly fast.  There something between little and no lag when you tap on an icon until the app launches.  Is this due to the hardware or KitKat?  I don't know, but I also don't really care.The battery life, and power management, are better than the previous phones.  One of my ongoing issues with the Samsung phones is that while I was driving with my phone plugged into a charger when I using the GPS, playing an audio file to my radio, and having my Bluetooth headset active, the battery drained.  I'd lose 30% of my charge in an hour drive.  And the battery would overheat, with the whole phone becoming uncomfortably hot.With the Nexus 5, I do all that stuff and the battery gains charge!  I've gotten into the car with the phone at less than 80% charge and gotten to work with the battery fully charged and the phone wasn't hot to the touch.The camera is great and the screen is amazing.Are other phones better?  Maybe.  And surely something better will be along in six months.  But for now, I'm a very happy camper.A quick note - the phone is available at the Google Play Store for $349 for a 16gb version and $399 for a 32gb version.  Mine was in my hands 4 days after I ordered it, well before Google promised to ship it.  As long as the phone is available from Google at a better price, why pay these inflated prices?", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "No complaints, absolute gem of a phone.", "Author": "D.

Look at the web as to how to distinguish the two. Google store was dumping the old inventory at the time I bought it, and I have the older version, even though the new one was available for over a month. There was no indication whether the \"new\" or \"old\" phone would ship.I doubt that this is a big deal in the overall long-term function of this device, but it would be good to be able to buy the \"new\" version if given the choice.Some problems that have surfaced:-the phone has a habit of sometimes forgetting it's hooked up to a BT device.-phone doesn't always like to connect to WiFi without a restartFor this I'm deducting a star.Original review below:Bought this on the google play store. $400+ tax and shipping. Had it on my doorstep the next day.Came from s3, and didn't want to renew my contract with SprintPros:-beautiful screen-almost no pre-installed software-fast processors-excellent microphone, most people I call say they can hear me much more clearly-seems to have a better antenna than the s3, have been getting better reception-long battery life-cheap (nearest competitors are 200-250 more)Cons:-google INSISTS on shipping phone with \"hangouts\" which is  a clunky SMS program--forcing you to either endure it or downloading an ad-infested 3rd party SMS app-doesn't seem to like any USB cable except the one that shipped with the phone-charging seems to take a while-screen is a bit dim, even when set to manual and the highest setting--a problem when outdoors in bright sun.

For one, using an android device provides an integrated experience with all things google (Google Calendar, GMail, Docs et al) and provides an ecosystem alternative at a very affordable price - which brings me to the Nexus 5.LIKES5\" displayLook / feel - minimalist with a good solid feel that isn't bulkyDesign - OS and features are very well put together and the \"pure android\" experience is a promise I look forward toDISLIKESBattery life - as expected at the price, I believe (Minimum of 1 full charge the night before and average use)Call quality - not sure what the secondary microphone does for you, but I have had a few call quality challenges that seemed to even out after the first week or so when I got the phone.ATTRACTION - PRICE, AND \"PURE\" ANDROID EXPERIENCEThis phone was an attractive offering for me because of the price point, but also because of the exclusion of 3rd party software that comes with non-nexus android devices. In my opinion, the Nexus 5 delivers on the promise of an android experience that is curated by Google and free of 3rd party interference. Since this is my first nexus device, I'm yet to see what the update commitment will be over the lifetime of the device as Google releases OS updates / new versions.DESIGN: 4.8/5The design is somewhat minimalist in my opinion - especially the device exterior. The weight of the Nexus 5 is evenly distributed across the device, leaving you with a 5\" smartphone that feels light for it's size, but not flimsy or as cheaply made as you might fear at the price point.CALL QUALITY 3.8/5Starting out, in the first week after I got my device, there were phone call quality issues, but whether these went away because of software updates, or because my issues had nothing to do with the phone itself, I am unsure. Articles online suggest there were hardware changes too, and I suspect I got one of the \"newer\" versions after the modifications to the initial hardware for the nexus 5. My call quality today is as expected for a handheld device, but does seem to depend some on the secondary microphone positioned on top of the phone.BATTERY 3/5The battery is what you need to get through a day with power - the nexus 5 promises \"all day battery life\" which it delivers on at average use. Peak use sees you running out of power somewhere at the end of the work day. I would say for the price, the battery is satisfactory.CAMERA **The camera software took some getting use to - the design is different from what I had been use to with my last phone, but this shouldn't come as a surprise (new OS, new software). The photos appear to be pretty good, but not being an avid photo taker / critic myself, I'll refrain from scoring here.DISPLAY 4.8/5The display delivers on the pleasures of a larger smartphone (5\").OVERALL 4.5/5Where 5 is the most awesome smart phone you could buy vs. value for price paid, I think the Nexus 5 gives you a very good deal @ the offered price. I spent $400 before tax on my 32GB model direct from Google, and considering the competing price points at > $600, I'd say I feel very satisfied.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "great buy", "Author": "Boban Stojanovic", "ReviewID": "R1ETCH27X6P04J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is simply great.

Frankly this is the first time I buy an android phone with a stellar experience right out of the box.

Sembower \"JS\"", "ReviewID": "R1TDPKLMM82T4Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The last three phones I've had have been Nexus.  Previously, I used the iPhone 3G.  I am giving the Nexus 5 four stars instead of 5 because I have yet to find a perfect phone.I define a perfect phone by providing responsiveness, excellent battery life, and an optimal user experience (vast array of applications, features, and feel).The Nexus is the best job Google has ever done to provide me with everything I want.  However, there are shortcomings.  I'll address the benefits first, and the negatives second.Why you need the Nexus 5:1.  This phone is widely available off contract for $399.  The price here is a little higher, but with Prime, you know what you are getting.  That's roughly half of the off-contract price for a new iPhone.2.  If you are operating on an unlimited T-Mobile plan as I am, in Seattle, this sucker is FAST.  Regularly receive over 25Mbps download, over 6Mbps upload.  Fast enough to watch baseball games in real time.3. No bloatware.  I made the switch from Verizon to T-Mobile after my Galaxy Nexus took forever to get updates.  Don't have to worry about that anymore.  If you want the most recent software on your Android Device, purchase a Nexus of a Google Play Edition phone.  done.4. Feel.  The phone feels great in my hand.  They improved the design greatly over the Nexus 4; the back is an almost rubberized plastic, where the 4 was easily shattered glass.  Where the look of the 4 may have been prettier, it feels as if LG/Google wanted to design this thing to be a workhorse.5.  Wireless charging.  Continuing with the 4's charging legacy, all my Qi-chargers work with this.  Note: you don't have to purchase the super-expensive wireless charger from Google.  It looks pretty, but it's price is astronomical.6.  Apps.  Between the Amazon App Store and Google Play store, I find 99.9% of what I want.  I love Amazon MP3 on here.  No DRM, quick downloads.  Seamless.Now...for the bad:1.  Amazon Instant Video - it's a no show. Can't get it native (read: the app) on any Android phone.2.  Camera.  The inclusion of HDR made the Nexus camera better, but it still feels like an also-ran.  If you're connected to Instagram or any other selfie-driven service, an iPhone will probably suit you better.  I take pictures with a nice DSLR.  This camera is used to snap a photo of where I parked :).  YMMV.3.  No Verizon.  Until Verizon lets this phone on their network, it will never get 5 stars.  Verizon would have to agree not to modify the software...and I don't see that happening.4.  Battery.  Still better than its predecessors, I think having a phone with extraordinary battery life (think old BlackBerries) would be a killer Nexus feature.  I get a full day, but want more.In summation, if you are on ATT, Sprint, or T-Mobile, and you want a workhorse off-contract device, you've met your new best friend.  You won't be let down.  However, if you want Amazon Instant Video, go get an iPhone.  You won't find it here.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I have ever owned!

So let me elaborate...My previous phone (not counting the Note 3) was a Nexus S, one of Google's earlier and not-very-widely-adopted phones. Although made by Samsung, it was a pure Google Android phone with none of the bloat-ware associated with some manufacturers. And with none of the multiple account sign-ups (Google Account + Samsung Hub + ???). I did like the pure Adnroid experience then, and I like it now on the new Nexus 5.Although I missed out on the Nexus 4, two family members each picked up one of those popular phones when Google slashed the price prior to launching the Nexus 5. While those we're outstandingly good value purchases, I'm glad I waited for the Nexus 5 myself.The Nexus 5 is slim and stylish in a very understated way, like a little black dress (but I'm not a girl). Out goes the bling, and in comes a slightly rubberised back which is way nicer than it sounds... and reassuring to hold. The screen is a pleasure to look at, because you can't see the individual pixels, and it's big enough without being a \"phablet\". It's fast and responsive, 4G-ready, the latest Android 4.4 KitKat, and very good value for the price I paid \"in store\" soon after launch (hence not a verified purchase here on Amazon). Documentation is scarce, so you may have to do a lot of experimenting or reading around on the web, but there is always The (Unofficial) Google Nexus 5 SmartPhone Book : The missing manual for LG's Android 4.4 KitKat phone.It really is no exaggeration for me to say that I have been telling all my friends that \"this is the best phone I have ever owned\".

The screen was NICE on the previous generation, but the N5 is so much more polished.  The screen makes the most of a very slight increase in area by increasing the pixel density.  Where on the N4 pixels were noticeable, the N5 density basically eliminates any issues with this. Also, the only screens that compare with this phone are all Androids.  The iPhone 5/5s can not compete with a screen this size, a full inch larger.Speed (+) Although I'm not a power user on my cell phone, I did notice an increase in speed while opening apps and in the blends when moving between screens.  I'm told that the Qualcomm S800 is a big step up in performance, but you'd have to ask someone else for their personal experience.OS (++) I've tried virtually every operating system for smartphones since the Treo 600 when I was in college 9 years ago.  When you buy a Nexus device, one of the big advantages is getting the new Android OS first.  While I didn't notice a HUGE difference in 4.4 (Kit Kat) over 4.3 (Jelly Bean), I'm happy knowing that whenever 5.0 drops, I'll be first in line for the improvements.  As far as how this OS compares historically, I've been a recent iPhone owner and Android compares favorably in nearly every way to Apple's iOS.  The only significant differences between the two are: 1) Lower innovation, higher polish of iOS apps vs Higher innovation, lower polish for Android apps.  2) Higher customization for Android.  This can go either way... I know plenty of smartphone users who want simple. In that case, higher customization just adds unnecessary steps/hassle.Battery (-) While listing this as a negative, this phone really does compare to most of the high end smartphones on the market.  At 2300 mAh, and a new, more battery friendly LTE radio, it performs as expected.  My issue with the battery here is simple... it's a VERY thin phone.  I'd be happy to sacrifice a bit of the form so the battery could last a full day of heavy use... or closer to it.  This is really a judgement on the industry, but that being said, this phone does NOT last through a full day for this user.  One of the only high points for this phone regarding the battery is that it's wirelessly rechargeable.  While the N5 wireless charger isn't out yet, the N4 charger does work, and helps make charging just that much easier.ADDITIONAL INFO:Speakers (--) Really disappointing. Was hoping for decent volume.

Its as beautiful as black iPhone 5S and Kitkat OS is on par (actually better) with iOS. You can say its bigger iPhone (I mean it) because Android OS is more flexible, customizable and powerful and it is bigger than in size like its big brother. The bigger size definitely helps in games and all kind of media consumption.This device performance is buttery smooth and the overall experience inspires utmost satisfaction. Given its size it feels so light and slim even compared to iPhone 5/5s.It is not even best nexus device so far but best out yet among all.And now I will explain it.--------------------------1. Design, look and build quality-> I differ here from most reviewers who says its plain or boring and nothing stands out of this. Its as good looking as black (space gray) iPhone 5S. Its all black like iPhone 5s. Though its made of plastic its feels sturdy, well built with precision only known to Apple. And for the people who tell iPhone made of aluminum, Nexus 5 sides appears no inferior to iPhone 5S black sides. The front glass is very well fused with the body with almost no gaps. Now what we are left with? Back? The back of Nexus 5 is though made of plastic it feels very good in the hand and due to its matte finish does not seem to slip off.Now one step further...iPhone 5S black (or space gray) seems to have identity crisis of being black or something else, Nexus 5 black is perfectly black and it has got radically different sides (not plain round rectangle which all other smartphones have). The sides are beautifully something else.iPhone 5S beauty is revealing and Nexus 5 beauty being black is mysterious and never gets boring.I love this black beauty and don't blame for my taste as they said \"beauty lies in the eyes of beholders\".\"Simplicity is Beauty and Beauty is simplicity, nothing more, nothing less.\" - Oscar Wilde. If any phone on the market lives up to the Oscar Wilde's quote its Nexus 5.In short its unapologetically simple\".2. Processor/speed-> Buttery/silky smooth. Neck to neck with iPhone 5s and second only to Note 3 for all practical purposes.3. Screen/display-> Awesome. Its better than retina any time as its full HD. The feeling of display being washed up goes away very soon and remember the so called best retina have the same problem as they share the same display technology.4. Ecosystem-> Android eco system is as good as Apple's. In fact I find it better because of Android OS power you have kind of powerful applications which Apple fan boys can never have. Apple fan boys just give a try to 'tasker' (Warning: Only if you can handle Android's raw power.)5. Powerful Soul-> \"Fools are those who don't want their souls to be powerful.\" Its as good as iOS but better why? because its powerful and customizable. You can do the things with it when you need. Its no way comparable to inferior iOS. Apple fan boys! People should not be proud of a system which does not even let them change default for anything.6. Call Quality -> Fantastic. I have never had so clear voice on call for very long.7. Network Signal Quality -> Fantastic.8. Volume/Speaker-> Inherently the speaker is very loud. Though in some application it might sound a little short of enough but its software related problem and should be fixed in future update. I have tested the volume in many application like play and in some apps are freaking load. While playing music through play I had to cut down on the volume in car its so powerful.With headphones its fantastic. The voice quality is very superior and has no noise in it. Its as pure as it gets.9. Camera-> I have seen all the comparisons of Nexus 5 with all leading phones (HTC one, Nokia Lumia, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4) and its competing neck to neck in every department except its little slow to focus. But once it focus it takes very good images. HDR+ beats all other phones (I swear it). But again Google admitted it was software related issue and would be fixed soon through update. Personally I am pretty satisfied with the camera.Its at least best nexus phone camera and comparable to others except in little slower to focus. The photos are very detailed with accurate colors.Note: I have uploaded some photos for reference.10. Battery-> No complaints. Nothing great or bad here. Its definitely better than many old phones (including galaxy nexus) and equal to many others.It just falls short of only two smart phones right now which are LG G2 and Note 3. But it's battery is comparable to the best smartphone i.e. iPhone 5s. So if iPhone 5S can be the best with that kind of battery I don't understand how we could complain of Nexus 5. For casual usage you will charging it once a day. The noticeable thing is that in idle mode it does not eat battery at all and that's where it will average out better end of the day.11. Reparability-> iFixit has given its 8 of 10 in this department and you should feel comfortable saving your money on costly repair by doing many things yourself and the whole assembly is modular.Summary-> Even keeping its lower price aside, Its the one of best smart phone and should equal or better any best smart phone on the planet right now.

It also frees up space so you can store more things like images and video, and system memory so your programs run a little faster. It also gives you a single set of apps that work together flawlessly. Dialer, Hangouts (SMS and instant messaging), and People (contacts) work the way they should without the need to get replacement apps for core features to use your phone.Ergonomically, this phone feels great. The soft-touch rubberized backing keeps the phone from slipping out of your grip. A ceramic volume rocker and power button, while not as substantial as the metal-clad iPhone 5s, give the phone a light-weight and solid feel.One of my concerns with the phone is the rubberized backing. In the past, I've had cases with a similar coat of soft-touch material that has rubbed off over time. And while it hasn't happened yet, it may happen eventually. And while the camera and speaker are adequate, they're definitely not industry-leading. Even though the most recent Android update addressed some camera issues, the camera still has some difficulty focusing when you want to take pictures. So while it might work well for a few Instagram pics, it won't replace your point and shoot. The speaker, on the other hand, does get loud enough, but with the quality of a cheap AM radio. Fortunately, sound from the headphone jack is just fine.Overall, if you're looking for a slick device with a gorgeous screen and a slick interface, you can't go wrong with the Nexus 5. While it may have the luxurious finish or take gorgeous pictures like an iPhone, or play music out of front-facing stereo speakers like the HTC One, it nails its core features, like messaging, taking calls, and running apps on a beautiful HD display. What's more, the fact that you can pick it up off-contract on the Google Play store is a nice bonus.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "good phone - great price.", "Author": "Ihsaan khan", "ReviewID": "R30TV2TLUNE6FN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The price performance rating on this device is great.

If taken properly they were good but this needs a small bit of practice to achieve the perfectness in the picture. with iphone 5s the camera is pretty good and in certain conditions nexus 5 falls below in this place. in low light conditions iphone 5s does take better pictures that. Videos are decent and pretty good.SKYPE \\ VIDEO CHATBelieve me I don't know what iphone does but Nexus 5 falls well behind in this department. I have tried to skype with my parents (who stay in india )using iphone 5s , ipad air and nexus 5 in and around the same time repeatedly nexus 5 used to drop the video call in between. with iphone and ipad air this is not seen anywhere. the calls are pretty smooth.MOVIES & SOUNDiphone 5s is way ahead in terms of sound clarity or the quality of sound. the volume on nexus 5 is low. when it comes to the screen size of nexus 5 was very apt to watch the movies \\ videos from youtube \\ Netflix.DESIGN , LOOK & FEELBoth are pretty good in their own ways.

I called google to explain them, the google representative transfer phone to LG company. They charged $170 to replace the screen which is half of new phone price.I received the phone two weeks later. The phone is not receiving signal from T-mobile sometimes received one or two bar of low signal but that was E or H signal which is very slow, not even 3G, 4G nor LTE. I did not get any signals indoor at all. I called LG service again to explain, they told me to return the phone again to their service center with provided return label which was not overnight service it was Fedex ground service. I have to wait another two weeks to received my cellphone back.Two weeks later I received phone back from LG but it was same condition. I seems they did not even looked at it. it did not received any strong or fast signal from t-mobile. I called LG again, they told me same thing like two weeks ago. \"Send it back to LG\".I bought nexus5 I used it for three days, I could not used my phone for more than a month now. LG seems not care, they will send me another ground shipping label to send it back, I have to wait another two weeks.

Google is guilty of doing this on the Nexus 4 too, with the Glass design, and as an Android fan I'm disappointed to see this trend emerging.. but I digress.Screen is great But then there's the BATTERY LIFE... Don't get me started on the Battery life. Damn the battery life.It is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE etc. The phone dies. The phone dies a lot. The phone dies doing nothing.Example~ I went to bed with 52% battery life, no 3rd party apps installed, no GPS, just wifi. I woke up... late.The phone had died in about 6 hours while it was doing absolutely nothing and I woke up refreshed but very late.The battery life also has wild fluctuations... it's quick to die but some days it may choose to surprise you with longer than usual battery life.Battery fixes exist but they'll require you to get Quite technical and potentially void your warranty (Root) -- info can be found @ XDA Developers.Speakers on the phone are pretty bad, if I'm honest. My phone's also been having calling issues -- it refuses to accept/acknowledge calls even if I had full bars, in some tests... the Radio needs an update, and again that'll require you to get Technical (XDA) unless Google releases a Over The Air update (OTA).If you get this phone (and they doesn't fix the battery issue via an OTA) bring a charger & cable with you everywhere you go...the battery issue it itself is grounds topotentially avoid this phone.**SOFTWAREVanilla Android (Kit Kat) is pretty nice & it's what originally attracted me to the Nexus lineup. The latest version (4.4 KitKat) is pretty sweet but it has a few quriks. Google is trying to deeply integrate Google Now into the phone, this means that they replaced the menu card to the left of the homescreen with a giant Google NOW window --- I'm not a fan of this feature at all but it's relatively easy to replace with a custom launcher.TEXT MESSAGING has also been revamped -- everything gets grouped into Google Hangouts by default. It's easily changeably but it's clear that Google's getting greedy for user data now. The New Hangouts client manages hangouts & your SMS. The SMS is now routed & associated with a Gmail ID and you can archive it away... but now it's clear that you're associated data to your Gmail account & Google's building an even bigger profile on you for data mining.Other than those two quirks the OS is it-self pretty good...although the camera suffers from pretty BAD shutter lag.**OVERALL**The phone itself is ok. I wouldn't call it a big jump up from the Nexus 4. The battery life issue is making me Seriously consider returning the device to Google. I plan to order a replacement LCD screen for my Nexus 4 & swap it out. I am awfully Disappointed with the phone's battery life & call performance after spending about a week with it. The OS is great but this phone itself is not worthy a worthy Flagship device -- which is probably why they didn't host an actual press conference to release this phone, they released it on a random blog post.~~~~~~~~~I originally wrote this review to discourage people from buying the Nexus 5 @ a ridiculously overpriced costs from people on here... it's three hundred and ninety nine from Google Play although there is a few week wait.FOR THE PRICE OF THE DEVICE (from Google Play) YOU CAN'T GO WRONG, the fact that it doesn't require contract makes it that much more awesome... KitKat is wonderful & the bang for buck w/ packed with specs is excellent. But the few shortcomings mentioned above are also big enough for me to seriously reconsider my purchase, but it just might be that I'm too picky with my phones.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "all programs freeze unexpectedly and immediately the phone reboots.", "Author": "Dawer Drew \"Drew\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZFBZP8RS1FEV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought nexus 5, the February 17, 2014 and at first everything worked fine.

The hardware is fantastic, the battery life isn't as bad as they say, and it's got enough power to make it a pretty impressive Mini-tablet experience. Android 4.4.2 (\"KitKat\") is pretty disappointing, what with levels of Google App integration that surpass Facebook levels of nosy spyware, but with a root and the XPosed Framework added, that's easy enough to work around.Unfortunately, it looks like LG and Google forgot that this thing was supposed to be a phone. If you don't install Google Voice (which \"conveniently\" stores all of your voicemail on Google's servers, which they'll then \"helpfully\" transcribe, incorrectly, and log for their future perusal to determine what kind of ads to shove in your face), then the only notification you'll get that you have new voicemail is a blank text message from a 4-digit code (I am led to believe that this is a Sprint-specific problem. Go figure).At least you won't have to worry about your contacts missing your actual text messages, though, since there's some kind of bug which makes the phone randomly decide to send them twice. This was originally reported as a problem with the \"Hangouts\" app being used for SMS (there's that google integration again, storing your text messages alongside your voicemail!). I wasn't using Hangouts, I was using ChompSMS, which I've used for over a year on my old \"Gingerbread\" phone without the problem peeking up.I guess one can make the case that in our modern, 140-character keyboard-swiping world, it was easy to overlook the fact that, when making something called a \"telephone\", it's generally a good idea to make sure audio quality is up to snuff. I've spent the majority of every call in the past week repeating \"What?\", \"I didn't get a word of that?\" and \"Are you chewing on a sock?\" to the unfortunate parties on the other end of my phone calls.

The experience of buying this phone in amazon was the worst experiece of buying in my life. I still not believe how this was disrepctful and disapointing. I am still trying to understand but i cant . You will certainly have problens  treating cusomers like that. See in you system the history of this process of me trying to buy the phobe in amazon. This was a marketing case of how not to treat a client. I think you should give  me a compensation for all the problens you caused that day,  In short, it was terrible, umbelievable disrespectful. You offered evidences that you do not know how to treat  a customer. My intention is to send a letter to your ceo telling him  everything that happened and ask him to be in my place as a cusyomer and see what he would do. Please  do not let this happens again. From my side i will never buy anything im amazon anymore and will tell to every friend and people that i know not to buy anything from amazon. It could not be  worse!!!
