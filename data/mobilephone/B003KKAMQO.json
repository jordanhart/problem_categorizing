I use them for PDAs and like them for the larger keyboard. When a BB 7290 died on me, I would just get another used online.  Since I keep them backed up on a regular basis, it's easy just to get another.  Unfortunately this one only lasted a few months before it died.  So now I'm using BB Curves for PDAs instead.  The keyboard is smaller, but the stamina is much better.  I speculate that the 7290s have a little program written into the firmware that simply shuts down the device permanently after so many hours/days?", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003KKAMQO"}}
