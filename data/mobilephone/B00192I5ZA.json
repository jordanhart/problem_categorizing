Bessenyei Jr.", "ReviewID": "R297XDCZQJBQ52", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about 4 months now and I have to say that I really like it.  The look of the phone is really appealing, and the interface is really quite new and different.  Navigation is pretty smooth and intuitive (when it isn't lagging, more on that later) and I love the way the keys change depending on what mode your in.  Call quality is crisp and loud.  The display is very good quality and album images and text appear clear and sharp.  The mp3 player on this phone is one of the best I've heard.  I connect it to my car stereo and, as far as audio is concerned, it even blows away the Creative Zen I had before.  Even the built in speakers are pretty good and don't sound as hollow and tiny as other phones.Now for the bad.  The reason I only gave this phone 3 stars is because of two pretty big issues.  The first is the 2mp camera.  For 2megapixels this produces some awuful shots.  The colors are washed out, blurry, and grainy no matter what light you're in.  Even the 1.3mp camera on my TMobile Dash took better pictures.  Much much better pictures.  The other issue is this ... the phone has 2GB of built in memory, but beware of using it to store songs.  The built in memory is touchy at best.  Some songs transferred to the phone mem just flat out wouldn't work.  On top of that, putting songs on the phone memory causes the phone to experience some serious lagging.  And it can get pretty bad, even hanging and lagging during calls.  Forget calling any company that asks you to hit a series of mumbers to get to the right department, and punching in something like an account # is a nightmare.  The only reason I didn't mark off heavily for this feature is because if you put songs on the micro sd only this seems to solve the problem.  But you do have to set the phone to keep the phone memory seperate from the memory card.  If it shares then it's the same issue.So, a good mp3 phone, cool interface, but bad pictures and make sure you upgrade the free 1gb micro sd stick because the 2GB on the phone is pretty useless.  Maybe a firmware upgrade will fix that later.", "Date": "February 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "If You buy this on Amazon, you are getting a great deal.", "Author": "Nicholas Willig", "ReviewID": "RWLZ58WCKSBA1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm just going to sum this phone up in a few sentences.  First, it looks great. It has a simple, yet elegant design.  Next, it has good performance.  While it's not as great as most Sony Ericsson phones, you won't receive too much lag, especially after you add more memory. Lastly, the battery is very good, and easily only needs to be plugged in once a day for an hour or so.Pros- Decent Music Player2mp Camera can create high resolution pictures, though they aren't amazing.True Headphone Jack2gb On board memory, expandable to 6gb.Great battery LifeScroll Wheel:Better than iPod wheelCool morphing keyboard.Cons- Music player lags sometimesCamera has no flash, and needs oneFaux Buttons are hard to text with, lag sometimesDurability is questionable; Screen scratches easily; Definately buy a protector3-d like menu lags to point of uselessness; Use one of the other menu options instead.OVERALL- I can't really recommend this phone to one specific audience, except for those who want a little bit of everything on their phone, in which case, this is a great buy.", "Date": "March 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "good for music", "Author": "Anil Pant", "ReviewID": "R4M0O5WKL7EX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched in the web for several weeks for a good unlocked phone with some real good music. I couldn't figure out which phone to buy but when i got this i knew it was the one I was looking for. With ipod quality music in headset n best in the inbuilt speaker this phone gives you rid of carrying two gadgets in your two pockets. The new keypad system that the motorolla introduced in this phone is real unique.  But if you are looking for a good camera phone its maynot be for you. The 2 megapixel camera is not so worthy and gives an average quality picture.  Over all its not so expensive so guys  go for it n give a try. You will then have a most coolest phone among your frens(provided non of your frens have iphone) just kiding......", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "It's stylish.", "Author": "Mahendra", "ReviewID": "R3BYIMYQ0VOUXG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is very stylish.

It's a lot like a touch panel on the Enterprise from Star Trek and more then once people have said it looks like something from the future. The phone is very well constructed and there is nothing cheap feeling about it, with the headphone jack it easily passes for an expensive MP3 player.It's performance is where the phone takes a hit, after a while (maybe a month) it starts getting a little sluggish and buttons don't always respond right away, or it lags while typing a text message... Going through a phone tree or doing phone banking can be a real test of patience and it gets progressively slower over time. I'm not really sure what causes this and no firmware update so far has resolved this issue, but shutting if off for a couple minutes usually fixes the problem.The camera is only okay and will take decent pictures if there's a good light source, but the quality drops significantly if there isn't. It also takes decent video, but again it needs a decent light source.Overall I'm very happy with the phone, it has been used VERY hard and has been abused quite a bit, most of my cell phones meet their tragic end pretty quickly. I use it like an MP3 player at work or when I'm motorcycling, to store documents and files, to record audio notes and classes, and even to talk in the shower... Although I don't hold it directly under the shower head, the rubber seals are enough to keep out the shower mist. This has the making of a fantastic phone, but that naggin laggin keeps it from achieving greatness.", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "At first a great phone, after several months of normal cell phone use, bad phone.", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R2CT3ZXBXDEOZ6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had my E8 Rokr for about 8 to 10 months now and have been pretty satisfied for what I needed in a cell phone. The Mp3 player on this phone rivals most high-end Mp3 phones I've seen including iPhone. The sound quality is very good. Although I have put up with the phones lagging and response delay, I have just recently experienced the keypad problems. The keypad is not a normal pad where you type what you need with buttons. It is a virtual sort of pad that changes modes to fit whatever task's you're performing on the screen. Three big keypad buttons have stopped working. My menu pad, my backspace pad and my #4 pad that also has my 'ghi' numbers for text, which I cannot use anymore. Unless you get a warranty or insurance on this phone, you're pretty much going to be stuck with buying a new phone. I do not like this phone anymore and the only reason I have given The Rokr two stars, is because I am big into music and the Mp3 player will be the only thing that I will miss when I drop kick this phone into the trash can.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Phone Is Not Responsive to Touch", "Author": "Music Fan", "ReviewID": "R33UIQIJNLV3YX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As other reviewers have indicated, the processor sometimes freezes up, which means that when you press a button, there can be a delay before the phone processes that the button has actually been pressed.  The delays can be as short as a second or two, or can last for close to a minute.  This is particularly frustrating when a call is coming in and you press (and press and press) \"answer\", but the phone does not answer the call and it bounces into voice mail.  This doesn't seem to relate to using the memory to store music, since I don't have any music stored on my phone.  If I had known that I wouldn't be able to answer many incoming calls and would have problems using the buttons to make calls, I never would have bought the phone.  Super frustrating.  I'm sending it back to Motorola to see if they can fix the problem, but since a number of people have commented on this, I'm not expecting any miracles.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice phone slow processor", "Author": "Michael J.

The display is ok for a smaller display.  I really like that key pad is easy to feel and totally closed from dust.  Motorola's click/scroll wheel which is intended to be similar to the one found on an ipod is ok but seriously lacks something when compared with an ipod.My biggest gripe is that the processor on the phone is a bit on the slow side.  Every now and then the display looks frozen and the buttons don't do anything.
