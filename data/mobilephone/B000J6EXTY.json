The software is slow, especially when the phone is loaded with lots of pictures.  The buttons are clumsy to push, especially if you have big fingers.  Ergonomically you would do better with an older model Motorola cellphone.  The buttons on the side are laid out in a manner that when you handle the phone you frequently  tend to change the ringer to off inadverdently.  That is a real design boo boo.The RF section is, however, pretty sensitive and stacks up well against any other phone in terms of talk distance and reception.Don't waste your money.", "Date": "November 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous, Functional", "Author": "World Famous Sam", "ReviewID": "RZMM7BEU581HL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a phone that is the best value for your money, stop reading right here. This phone isn't for you.If, however, you're looking for a functional phone that is attractive and garners a lot of attention from passersby and fashionistas alike, you're in the right place.The Motorola V3i DG is a great phone - it is a RAZR after all. Some people don't like the RAZR because they think it's been played out or overdone, but this phone is unique and has a definite \"cool factor\". The phone's features are a standard late 2005 or early 2006 featureset - there's an MP3 player, a transflash slot, a camera (that could be a lot better, but that's Motorola for you - it's a phone), a video camera, support for real-song ringtones, and a nice set of screens.If you're looking for a device for e-mail, this probably is not your phone. If you like to text constantly and IM casually and you talk often, this is a great phone for you. My one gripe is that the speaker phone is of a low quality compared to the RAZR I had for Verizon. Other than that, it's an excellently-crafted piece of work.I highly recommend this phone (with the awesome-looking DG case).", "Date": "January 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "In the end...it's still just a cell phone", "Author": "Marilyn Briggs \"Marilyn Briggs\"", "ReviewID": "R1QYJ85KKVFEJS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone I found is over priced, and doesn't work any differently than my mom's razor phone that she got for free from her cell phone provider.

I have no problems using text messages (someone had said they did) There is a slot for a micro SD card inside the phone (I have a 2GB card) so it doesn't really run slow for me. The phone has additional features a regular razr does not, like airplane mode, iTunes, and what I like best, software that you can transfer pictures to your phone from your computer (make your own wallpaper!) and can make your own ringtones with. Since D&G; designed the phone there are some misspellings in the English lol (like dialled calls, personalise for example). There are times when I don't have signal when I should, but there are also times when I get signal when noone else does (like on the subway) so its a coin toss. All in all I love having th phone.

This is a trendy phone for those who love to show off. It has some great new features as compared with the older versions of the razr. It's not a PDA or a smart phone and is not intended to be. This is stickly for the fashionistic age, those who want to show of something that not everyone has. As a matter of fact, you won't see anyone carrying this phone where I'm from (MI) and only 2 people have purchased it in the Metro Detroit area so far (me being on of them). So it's rare, and it's nice to have something that no one else has. I love it for what it is. It's way better than the other razrs and the phone mp3 is pretty ok. Especially for the $200 I paid for it. I enjoy this phone and the looks people give me when they see it. So don't buy it if you are into high quality features that a smart phone has to offer, buy it if you want to be flashy and rare!

But let's just say that this phone does carry the Dolce & Gabbana name. Now their clothing may last long but other things, expect to use it for about a year, this phone will be outdated. Now let's move onto the targeted market for this phone.The targeted market this cellphone was designed for is for those that wear Dolce & Gabbana clothing. Walking around with this phone is suppose to complement your outfit and especially with the D G logos dangling around.Now for the quality. Since this is a Dolce & Gabbana phone we treat it as an accessory. It shouldn't be used everyday nor should it be used to bring to work. This is more like the evening phone when you go somewhere special so complaning about it's quality is kind of.... not smart since this is what this phone was designed for. Now onto the actual v3i phone review.This phones camera is leaps better than the original v3. Even though it is only at 1 megapixel it still produces pictures good enough for the smaller prints. Video record is a shame as usual due to the limited resolution. Video playback on this phone isn't choppy but the phone can't really handle the high framerates. Using this phone as a music player, the quality is there but no where near an mp3 players quality. THe phone offers a micro sd slot and I think you can near around 2gb with these things, but I never cared to purchase one. THe accessories for this phone aren't really that expensive and are very affordable if you compare them to the actual Dolce & Gabbana accessories, not the ones with Dolce & Gabbana and Motorola. The cases run for about 70 dollars I think for the ones with Motorola, and the ones with just Dolce & Gabbana should start at around 255 dollars, and go way higher.  overall this phone does deserve a 5 stars and if you plan on purchasing this phone, you have to know it is just a phone for a night out don't look at those people complaning about this phone saying how slow the os is, i found it just right because you can't really compare it to a smart phone.", "Date": "January 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great BUY!", "Author": "J. ponce", "ReviewID": "R2ZZTF5HNL31TS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use my phone for my life!
