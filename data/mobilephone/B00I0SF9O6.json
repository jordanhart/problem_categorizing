Great, simple to use, phone. When I brought it into T-Mobile to get a simcard for it, the staff passed it around commented on how easy it was to understand how to use. The numbers on this phone are really big.

In reality, it is a cheaply made phone with a very limited range of features. In its defense, it is a REALLY LOUD phone. Just not what I had in mind.

I would have liked to known that it wasn't 3-G. BEFORE  I PURCHASED IT.The SOS button doesn't work. The speed dialer does, though. Moot point. I have only one SIM card in the phone, so it keeps asking me to insert a SIM card.It has the ability to work on two networks at once. (two SIM Cards) The charging cord is too short to be practical.It is very difficult to line up to insert. My wife tore off the rubber cover in frustration.I guess a USB extension cord would help.The navigation buttons are hard to use, up down left right.Be careful with the brass battery cover screw, don't drop it.The phonebook is not easy to understand but works well enough.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "mick gokey", "ReviewID": "R30GHU7A6P8AYN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "inexpensive but it seems to be well made will do every thing I need a phone to do. easy to use .", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's not bad but not ideal for a senior", "Author": "Isaac", "ReviewID": "R1OEMB235X0ECZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone still have too many features for a plain phone. I bought it for my elderly aunt who is hard of hearing. With no way to adjust the volume, she can't hear well on it. Also the phone has a keypad lock feature. To unlock it, you have to press the unlock key and the end button very fast.  Usually within a second or so.  It usually takes her 4 or 5 tries to unlock it so she can use it. It's decent and rugged with a big number display and late buttons, but it could do without a few things.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exactly as advertised.", "Author": "Luong Phan", "ReviewID": "R30MR85XTADHIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this phone for my 94 year old Grandma.

Oh sure, the numbers in the display are large, and so are the numbers on the buttons. But the volume does not go very loud, and is difficult to hear in some situations. The directions are not clear, and forget customer service. I wanted to put a different ring tone on the phone, and can't figure out how to do so. The charging cord is short and cheap.

He already has a plan with t mobile so he felt trapped. Now this phone serves all his needs while allowing him to regain self control. These phones do require bigger sim cards than what is normally supplied through t mobile, but they can switch your sim card over to the larger, older style in minutes for a nominal fee at any t mobile store. The charger port on the phone is bigger than your average universal smart phone charger port, but the appropriate charger is supplied with the phone and many adapters still exist out there that would work for this phone. Even though my loved one is not a senior, he has peace of mind managing his restaurant at night with the sos feature and also likes the excellent flashlight feature.
