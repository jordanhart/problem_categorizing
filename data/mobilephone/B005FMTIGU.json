It's the biggest piece of crap out there. I'm sure there are Blackberry models that are better but I have no desire to find out. Maybe back in its day, this was something, I don't know. I owned it for about 4 months and couldn't stand it. The keys are small and slippery and have a slight angle, half of them to the left and the other half to the right. I have never had trouble typing on a QWERTY key board but this was impossible. 99% of the time I would hit the key next to it or both together. It severely slowed down typing speed because I always had to go back and correct. The screen is super small. It was very hard to read email and attachments. Browsing the web was just a waste of time because of its slowness and tendency to lock up, and don't get me started on rebooting the phone. It took around 5 minutes to restart. This may be normal for a Blackberry but seriously? The call quality was equally bad, especially when using the speaker. Never heard more crackling and distortion. I hated this phone so badly, that every time I hear the word 'Blackberry' my hair stands up! I'll stick with Apple or Samsung.", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "exelente", "Author": "Marvin", "ReviewID": "R32B0L6J374TGJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hola desde Honduras he comprado dos telefonos con este vendedor y por el momento estamos satisfechos asi que se los recomiendo.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "My phone is not charging at all", "Author": "smoothblackliver", "ReviewID": "R1R62TDJKGV8GG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The battery is not charging at all and when i put in another battery from my old blackberry it is charging so please let me know what to do.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "the phone never worked", "Author": "s.smith", "ReviewID": "R2VTEBQ3DZLMJD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i am not pleased and very unhappy i bought unlocked phones before and never had any troubles this one refuse to function i am out the country without a phone and to top it off its costing so much to return so i feel cheated and robbed", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "RESETS", "Author": "cdoyle", "ReviewID": "R10AN5LZYWC9XI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My boyfriend wanted this phone and found this one new for a reasonable price. We got it, he liked it being the email addict that he is (he just checks, he doesn't send many if any), but it resets on him once or twice a day. Battery is a little inconsistent too. One minute it is at 20% then it'll reset and when it turns on, it's 60%. A little strange.(two weeks later)After having it for a month now, it has been causing nothing but problems the battery does not last an entire day (and he doesn't even use it a lot). It now resets at least 3 times a day (sometimes when he's trying to send a text or make a call). For a new phone, it's been a disappointment.
