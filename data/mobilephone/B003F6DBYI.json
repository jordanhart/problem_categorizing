I had it for more than 2 years before experiencing any problems and it eventually died.  Easy navigation, easy operation, and more options and tools than I'll ever need.  I liked its simplicity and wish there were more of them available new.  I'm not so connected to media that I need an iPhone or Droid.  I need to make and receive phone calls, need voice mail, to be able to send and receive the occasional picture, and send and receive text messages.

Kling \"JKling\"", "ReviewID": "R34X5QYYX80W6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hubby dropped his phone and we needed to replace it inexpensively. His previous enV3 didn't require a data plan on Verizon and so that's what we wanted in a new phone. We had problems with the enV turning itself off - known battery problem - so we wanted something different. Other online reviews indicated this phone also didn't require a data plan. However, when I went to change the phone through MyVerizon, they did require me to pick a data plan for it. They wouldn't allow data to be blocked on it like the previous phone.As for the phone itself, it's on the small side, the materials feel thin plasticky, and the speaker is a bit crackly. It has a bit of heft to it. The slide out QWERTY keyboard is handy. For less than $50, it's worth the $ and it'll do the job.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great but glitchy", "Author": "Becca-boo", "ReviewID": "R11LIVJ049V87C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was the first phone I ever got that I enjoyed, as I'd always been prone to throw-away pre-paid phones in the past. This little guy was great...for the most part. For the first perhaps 3 months, everything went without a hitch. It went through about 1500+ texts a month and never let me down. It's small but sturdy, and lived through many falls. However, after a while, it would have little irritating glitches. For example, it would decide I was using the touchscreen buttons when I clearly was not, and most of the time would send texts prematurely (as the \"send\" button is located on the touchscreen) and at it's worst, would begin deleting my contacts one by one in my address book. Not so fun! I got used to it and found ways to get around it, such as putting the recipient to texts in after writing out the text (when it tried to send it would merely say \"No recipient!\" and let me back to my texting), and locking it periodically as to avoid loss of contacts. It also had a problem after a while where, if the battery was dying, it would not notify you. It was particularly troublesome because it would show a full battery bar but then suddenly die, too shy to tell me it was dying. And after about the 100th or so fall, it would turn off on impact. I suppose it may be an upside to a cracked screen or messed up inside but it was a little inconvenient.All in all, it's a great little phone. I think a lot of the problems I had may have been avoidable if I didn't drop the thing so much, but all things considered, it really held up against the mighty floor. I got it mostly because I needed a phone without a data plan and it fit the bill, but I really came to enjoy it. A word for the wise, however. One of the arrow buttons takes you right to the web browser. I opened it enough by accident that it showed up more than a couple times on my bill. Reassign the button to something else unless you want extra fees.Cheers bro", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R1E350SYZOQ18U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is pretty great, i love it.

While the second phone was slightly better than the first, the touch screen was once again overly sensitive.
