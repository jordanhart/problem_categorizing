{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good for the money - 4 stars - poor battery life", "Author": "WLT", "ReviewID": "R1D1LB2RWJ4HF3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an entry level fairly recent (as of 2011) Blackberry.  I am a Blackberry user (10 years) and know blackberry. I have had Blackberries on Verizon, Sprint, ATT and T-Mobile.  I also have a state-of-the-art T-Mobile 9780 so it's safe to say I know what I'm talking about.This model is good for the money. Especially if you can pick it up for around $150.  It's bound to go lower as it gets older, more used models show up, and the new Boost Samsung Galaxy Prevail (Android 22) gets out and gets popular. The Android does more, and is $10 less a month on Boost since it does not require a Blackberry Plan that is an additional $10 a month.I've had this BoostBerry for two days and have really run it through the paces.  The screen is no where near as sharp as my 9780, but you can't expect it to be.  It's much harder to surf the web. You really have to use the ENLARGE option to read most web content. It does play certain videos you can find on the internet, but does not play others that need Flash - Of Course!Speed seems pretty good.  It does have 3g access capability, but don't expect this to be available in many areas. The Boost 3g network is sparse.  A Sprint person told me that Boost takes a back seat on their network in some cases. I do not know what he meant, but perhaps it will become apparent at some point.  Also, there is NO roaming to other networks. You are on the Sprint Digital CDMA network - PERIOD! The WiFi option gives you the capability to \"surf\" or listen to XM Radio App when you have no network or lean network, but does not allow phone or text seamlessly like T-Mobile.  You will have to get 3rd party programs to do that. This is sometimes handy. I fly a bit and it's nice to have your T-Mobile UMA Bberry port immediately to the SkyFi and then send and receive texts and emails while you are in the air.  It seems you can't do this with this BoostBerry - I'll continue to try and test that.When you first set it up, don't expect Boost to have it operational quickly. Network Provisioning of Blackberry service on Boost can take a while. Mine took 6 hours before I got an email welcoming me to the Blackberry Network. Boost says this can take up to 76 hours.  Note that my first Boost Blackberry Tech told me my phone was bad and needed to be returned because she could not get it to register emails. The phone was brand new, she simply did not know that provisioning took much longer than a few hours. Keep that in mind!  A Boost Blackberry Technician did NOT know that it took a while to provision the Bberry on the network and insisted I must have a bad phone and should return it.  Nonsense. You will have to be patient - with the activation and with the support!  There you go! Budget carrier? You bet! But you get what you pay for! Luckily I called back and a 2nd rep said \"Oh, you just activated the phone 4 hours ago. It's not partitioned yet. Give it up to 76 hours. Luckily 2 hours later I got the \"Welcome to the Blackberry Network\" message.  From that point on, I had the email up in 10 minutes.To summarize this - You can get text and voice within minutes of activation, but Email and network surfing along with other key features (Facebook - Twitter - Instant Messaging) can take from 6 to 76 hours to provision on the network.Boost has a sub website for setting up your own email ONCE the PARTITIONING is complete. If you try and register before then, you'll not be able to. For setting up email on your Boostberry. Boost will provide this link to you if you call them to set up your BoostBerry.Unlike OS 6 on the ultra-modern BBerries, you can at least run some neat apps like XM/SIRIUS radio. This does not work on the newest BBERRIES because OS6 does not support XM/SIRIUS apps.  You CAN'T run other apps like CODE MUNCHER as these ONLY work on OS 6. So there are trade-offs.Social networking is available, but separate and not integrated like OS 6 is.  You have to apply separate Twitter, Facebook, and similar apps to engage these features.  Anyone used to any BBerry on an OS older than 6 will not care as only 6 integrated these for you seamlessly.The battery life?  One of the main reasons I took off one star. It's not great. You better travel with a charger for your day journeys and for sure have a car charger.  The phone sucks up battery life.  My 9780 would give me a full day NO PROBLEM even with huge streaming. This model from Boost?  Maybe 6 hours if you are a heavy user. You'll have to recharge during the day.The internal memory only gives you about 110 meg additional to load apps, so you can't go CRAZY with apps or downloads to the main memory. You can only load apps to the main memory. The 2 g card that is included is for external memory - and I've not played enough with that to give you a good benchmark of what can and can't be accessed easily from it.Two minor things that are driving me crazy.I keep getting nonsense texts on the BoostBerry that make no sense at all. They appear to be system messages but are garbled and you can not make any sense out of them. Boost says they don't know why.  It's probably an issue with provisioning since I moved my service from another boost phone to this.Speaking of that... my OLD Boost phone keeps getting my Voice Mail message alerts.  I just edited this review, so it's been over 76 hours, and provisioning should be quite complete. Yet if I get a VM on my Boostberry, the old boost phone alerts me I have a message waiting. You can't USE the old boost phone, and YES, I had it off for 76 hours to make sure it did not interfere with the new Blackberry provisioning. Weird. But... It's a BUDGET cellular carrier! You get what you pay for!That's about it.Know you are buying a budget phone from a budget company, and you'll not be disappointed. If you are coming from such outstanding customer service companies like T-Mobile and are used to state-of-the art phones and service? You are going to be disappointed!It's worth the 60 bucks a month (shrinkage down to 45), and for an additional 5 bucks, international calling?  That's a good deal for many!", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great cell phone with no contract", "Author": "Lock Guy", "ReviewID": "R36XVVOAK5AG2M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I had Verizon for about 6 years, then I found out about Boost Mobile.

They were junk, and constantly gave me problems.  Water sensitivity, and long boot times, and no wifi made that phone a slug.  The updates 8530 however is an improvement in every way.  The only beef that I have with it, is that it no longer uses a usb 2.0 to charge/data.  They have moved to a proprietary plug, so i needed to get all new chargers.  Aside from that though, I love it.  Very fast, stable and reliable.

Never again! I NEVER had battery life, I was lucky that it even lasted 6 hours from start to finish and thats that I didnt use it at all. Pretty crappy phone, which brings me to this. Before I trailed off to other crappy phones, Ive always had Blackberrys. Dont know why I changed, I guess I was bored. Anyways, what I love about this one in particular is that it doesnt have the track ball, its not huge, but not small either. The battery life is FINE, I dont understand why people are complaining so much. I mean, what kind of phone only needs 2 recharges in one week? With constant usage I HIGHLY doubt that, as one reviewer claimed. This BB last me ALL day, from 8 am to 12 am till it is finally about to die, with constant usage, unlike my galaxy which I almost never used to conserve energy.Most people recharge their phones at night anyways, just recharge this BB every night and youll be fine. What I like about BBs is that its VERY manual. This is a phone you can configure to you needs and do countless things. You can even play vids. Though sometimes what the BB does is download it first and then it can play it. Idk. As long as I can play vids its fine. I liked the galaxy for that but whats the point if you never have battery? Texting is a little on the small side, but I love Qwert keyboards, which this has, duh.Overall, Id recommend ONLY if the person is computer or phone savvy...or atleast has high common sense. Blackberries arent for everyone, people just buy them because atleast they can add a contact and call, but this phone is soooo much more than that. BTW, I got this phone wayyyy ahead of time, like 4 days ahead so GO SELLER! The shipping was awesome.I gave it 4 stars because I really like it, but Im not in love with it either. The screens resolution isnt that great, its just decent and some apps work awkward for the BB (i.e facebook app  The good thing is however you can record vids, connect to wifi, even get apps, so thats cool.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "A nice phone", "Author": "wetbiker7", "ReviewID": "R2YK45M1IB7L4R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The BlackBerry 8530 is a nice phone .

O'Dowd \"Angie\"", "ReviewID": "RM7DKPCBEYO6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I  bought this phone about 8 months ago & I have had service through Boost since then with this exact model & color Blackberry phone, so far I love it & that's an understatement.  I use the monthly unlimited shrinkage plan so I can use the internet & make as many phone calls & make & receive texts for as long & as much as I want & it's still the same price every mo.  The shrinkage plan started at $60/mo & is now down to $55/mo & will go down again in a few months.  I have not had one single dropped call the entire time I've owned this phone, I kid you not.  Calls sound crisp & clear & loud.  Display is bright & clear & crisp as well.  The track pad is nice & sensitive & works great.  I wish the letter/number buttons were larger but that's just my personal preference.  E-mail is quick & easy to read & manage.  I have Facebook & Twitter on it & they're the real actual applications not texts or shortcut apps.  There are tons of apps through Blackberry app world which you can access & download right through the phone with extreme ease.  It comes with games but you can download more if desired just like most Smartphones.  The battery needs to be charged frequently if you're using the internet a lot, the net tends to suck the energy out of the phone quickly, I would suggest also purchasiung a car charger.  It also comes with a built in GPS no extra charge which speaks directions to you as you're driving, neat feature.  Start up & powering down are very very quick.  It takes photos & video however photos are pretty poor in low light, same for video, if you're taking a photo or video inside your house be sure to have LOTS of light as there is no flash built into this phone.  You will also need some type of silicone cover to protect the phone, the back is slippery & can easily slip out of your hand.  The Blackberry emblem on the back of the phone was cheaply made as the little silver dots are falling out-so far I've lost 3 of them.  I use this phone mostly for long distance phone calls & sometimes checking Twitter or e-mail & I'm very happy with it, happy with the quality & ease of use & with the Boost mobile plane, seriously you can't go wrong with unlimited everything for $55/mo.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phome", "Author": "Heather", "ReviewID": "R29LN08R9U58I3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone and i waited a week before writing this so i could mess with the phone for awhile.... to start the phone is great picture quality is awesome and the internet is so fast i was shocked after reading negative reviews my internet was fast i love that i can make my own ring tones for each person the button are a bit small but i love this phone and i'm pleased with all the things i am able to adjust to my likenesses, this phone is definitely worth the pay.

I have several blackberries and paid high prices for contract service. In November 2011, I took on the blackberry service. I don't regret it. I wished boost would bring out another blackberry. This phone gets tv, radio, internet, kindle, games, youtube, facebook, twitter, pen interest, and many other apps. I get mini opera browser which makes it easier to search. I have had two android phones from boost mobile and neither one of them would hold the battery charge like the blackberry. It has less dropped calls than any other boost mobile phone that I had. Since, the price is less than 100$ you can't beat the value. Trust the other carriers would charge way more than boost mobile for a smart phone like a blackberry. The facebook app is awesome. You can tag and instantly upload photos from the pictures without actually going to facebook. This is an added value to me. I listen to the radio all day long on my phone. The signal is great. I am hooked on my blackberry. So, for those looking for a smart phone that actually works I recommend the blackberry 8530. The price plan starts out at 60$ for unlimited everything, however with the payments on time for 18 months it would drop to 45$. You try to find that somewhere else. My niece and nephews constantly throw the phone on concrete, in water, and put stick fingers all over it. This phone has taken a beating since I purchased. Hey, it still works just has scratches on the back. Other than it is great. The video camera takes clear quality sound pictures and filming. The regular camera is just like all other phones.

If I were to stay with MetroPCS, it'd cost $149 + tax. I don't know about you, but out of all of them, $122 sounds pretty good to me. Not only was the price very low, the shipping and service with shopcelldeals was incredible. I ordered my phone on October 17, 2011, already knowing that I had until the 22nd to receive it to avoid paying two phone bills (MetroPCS and Boost Mobile), because your phone service MUST be on in order to keep your number. I took the chance because of the great reviews I read. Still unsure, I emailed the company on October 18, 2011 to ask about the delivery of my phone, and inform them of my concerns. Surprisingly, they responded to my email the SAME DAY! I was reassured that my phone would arrive before the 22nd. That was a sigh of relief because the estimated arrival was said to be October 21-October 26. I'd be doomed if it arrived on the 26th. It was a close call! Needless to say, my phone arrived on October 20, 2011. It was around the area at 8AM in the morning, but didn't reach my house until 4pm (but that is because my mailman comes around 4-5pm). I am VERY happy with my purchase! The phone is better than I expected, jumps from page-to-page with no problem, the resolution is great, it is lightweight but not at all cheaply made. I LOVE IT! You can't go wrong with this phone, or this company. It came in the Boost Mobile original packaging which made the deal 10x sweeter. It is just like buying it in the store, only in my opinion, 10x better! You will not be disappointed in this phone. I don't normally write reviews, this is my first time, so that just goes to show how happy I am with my purchase. I hope I helped you in your decision. Cheers!P.S. If you are worried about poor battery life, I haven't had any problems with mine. All I did was charge my phone before I began to use it, and its been perfect every since. I charge it completely every two days and it lasts despite heavy use!", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry 8530", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R35IXPAUENT90Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone and it's reviews match, the phone is great.

I was paying $60 + tax/fees = total $74 / month for unlimited text/voice, no data and I think it is a ripoff so I started looking for other options.I wanted a phone that could have full html access of the internet, that means I would be spending over $250 for a phone, no matter what the pre paid carrier was, virgin mobile, boost mobile, tmobile, ATT, etc...Now for $250, I was hoping to completely swiped out by the experience since I only paid $59.99 for my LG Prime and I am completely in love with that phone, so my review is based on the comparison of those two phones.1. Carrier signal strenght, ATT wins hands down vs Sprint. I live in FL, on the country side, ATT has full bars no matter if I am fishing at the lake or if I am inside my house out in the woods. So having signal is very important, ATT wins.2. The black berries are an old phone now, so althought new features have been added to them, the style and ergonomics are only for the fanatics of the device, there are other much more comfortable phones to use out in the market. With that said, hurrible key board, very tiny keys and very closed together, hard to use both thumbs and very easily you can end up with pain on your hands after one short text message. The LG only has a screen touch key board, but it is very responsive and big keys that are spaced out.3. Screen, the perfect square screen on the berry is tiny, not too sharp, and not vivid, lacking contrast. The touch screen on the LG Prime is awsome, I always receive complements about the LG prime and its screen colors when viewing photographs. And of course the screen size on the LG prime is rectangular and bigger.4. Sound... The berry has a nice feature, equalizer for the sound of the phone itself, I liked that. But althought the sound can be fine tune, the volume is not as loud as the LG which for me, is a plus, am ears are not as good anymore. Also, when listen to music onthe speaker phone, the LG is as loud and clear as if it was a boom box.5. Music Player... I like that the berry has dedicated keys for the music player on the top, that is a big plus. The player is not as flexible and it has its limitations. Also the Berry doesn't have an FM tuner which is a deal breaker for me. LG wins again.6. Battery life... I used to complain about the LG battery life until I got the Berry which is even worse. The Berry won't even last a full day if you are a heavy user so I have to have my charger always with me. I know that smart phones are power hungry, but the standard more or less is that a phone should last you the whole day and you should recharge it every night, anything less then that is not acceptable. Again, LG wins.7. Office features... I really had high expectation in this area... The Berries are now for being business heavy devices, again I find my LG has more of the stuff that I really use. This particular Berry doesn't have a lot of tools and the few are not readily avaialble. The LG even has a restaurant tip calculator...8. Menu Design... I have found a few issues with the menu navigation of the LG, but for the most part it makes sense and it is very intuitive. The Berry, I can't comprehend how is this device oriented to do business, I don't find it that intuitive. It does has little things that I like, but I am not blown away...9. Camera/Video... To this date when compared to other more expensive phone, I am in love with the LG camera. The Berry requires a lot of light to take a clean and sharp image. Unless under perfect lighting, the Berry will mostlikly produce blurry noisy images.10. Overall, I have discover that I am more of an iphone type of guy, althought I hate Apple so I would never own one, so LG Prime provides the happy medium for me, an iphone like type of phone that won't errase all my data when I try to sync with iTunes or just my computer... I am very music oritend, I like to be able to set reminders, go on the web, so I would apreciate more of a multimedia phone that is slim and not too big...11. Last but not least, Money talks. As much as I like the LG PRIME, I will just have to get used to the Berry because for less money, I get surf the web with unlimited access to WEB / VOICE / TEXT and that over rules anything else. I just wish that Boost had more choices when it comes to phones that can fully surf the web.I hope I touched on all the important points and that this review was helpful to you!", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "complain", "Author": "monica", "ReviewID": "RMBVRXIWUL3Z7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have complaints of this service ...
