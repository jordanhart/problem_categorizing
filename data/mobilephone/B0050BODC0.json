The charger is only for european plugins. It does come with a North American plug adaptor, but if you plug it in all the way it dosn't work, so you have to fiddle to get it just right. Can't find any screen protectors or cases for it yet.Overall she likes the phone.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1BQLE9VMOQI2N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a good basic phone. Has the main regular features and some. Trying to get a memory card to test some of the other features like internet and so on. It will do for the user who is not into fancy stuff.
