{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Why such bad reviews? Lookat the friggin price.", "Author": "OhhWell", "ReviewID": "R1T8MLURWRPP4B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife needed a new phone as her old Samsung Admire was having issues with the Charginr port... again. She doesn't like spending alot of money but liked the size and resolution of the screen on my LG Connect. I saw the coolpad and thought it would be perfect. I also saw the 1 star reviews and complaints here and wasn't so enthusiastic anymore. We decided to go to the local Metro PCS store and look at it anyhow.Luckly, the owner had one that was already open so we could get a hands on. Initialy, I was confronted with sluggish typing when trying out texting. Then I noticed that it was not the basic keyboard but something else like Swype. I switched it to the default gingerbread android keyboard and it was smooth as could be. We decided to go ahead and buy it because with the $50 rebate, there was no way you could beat the price for features.So.... once we got it home, I had to mess with it and test it out. First off, there is no root process for this phone yet that I could find. I was shocked however when the metro pcs garbage just let me uninstall it with no issues. The phone feels about as responsive as my son's Samsung Attain so we ran an AnTuTu benchmark on both phones. The Quattro's CPU scored a tiny bit better than the Attain and the GPU scored a tiny bit lower. Now remember that the Quattro has a higher resolution and therefore the GPU has to process 2.5x the pixels as the attain. That means that the Quattro will feel just about the same as the attain from a performance standpoint but you get a much higher resolution screen. Testing with a few games proved the assumption to be true. The attain was only a TINY bit smoother on games. Notmal phone and app perfromance seemed the same to me on both phones.The screen: I have seen the quality of the screen blasted on many reviews. I think it looks pretty darn good. Putting it side by side with my LG connect, I notice that the connect looks a little more natural and has a better viewing angle range and gets a little bit brighter. Having said that, I still thing the screen on the Quattro looks good. I will also say that I think that this Quattro screen looks better than the best 480x320 screen ever made. Also, for some people the screen size and resolution can be very important. For me it is as often for my job, I will need to access standard formatted web pages while out and about. The 800*480 resolution makes a world of difference.The call quality is pretty good. The signal is strong and the microphone picks up voices well. The earpeice speaker is a little muffled but was fine for me. My wife didn't like it too much till I turned the volume up. Speaking of volume, I had read on one professional review that the earpeice volume did not get loud enough. I'm not sure if that was an early model of this phone and they have since fixed the issue but I can say that my wife's gets pretty loud when turned all the way up.We haven't tested the battery life yet as my wife has gotten in the habbit of always putting her phone on a charger.So, in conclusion we have had no lockups, no reboots and no sluggish behaviour. Of course, that is after I changed to the stock keyboard and removed the MetroPCS apps. I can't think of any other phone that you can get at this price (Especially with the current rebate) with these features. As I meantioned earlier, it performs like a Samsung Attain but with a larger screen.Update: My wife started complaining that the phone was getting sluggish again. Then she started getting low memory warnings and realized that she had loaded quite a few programs that stay active. After removing a couple that she really didn't even use, the phone is back to responsive again.I saw somewhere on a professional review site that coolpad had stated that they had taken their time with the radio part of the phone and it does show. Often, the coolpad will have one bar more signal than my Connect and my son's attain while we are all in the same car. That was driving through the middle of florida and often meant the difference between getting reliable data and not. The signal strength on this phone is pretty darn good.Update April 2013: There is a root process for this phone now! Still no Clockwork Recovery that I'm aware of yet but at least you can finally root this thing.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty darn good for the price.", "Author": "Snavvy", "ReviewID": "R1U73T4MTIMA93", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't understand the negative reviews at all. I got this phone for $79, and for a 4G smartphone with Mobile Hostspot capability, that's a great bargain. This phone is faster than my 7\" tablet with similar specs. Plunk in a 16 Gb or 32 Gb microSD card and this can do everything. I use Amazon App Store for all my apps (I don't personally like how instrusive Google is) and installed Netflix, Pandora, WinAmp, Sky.FM and MoboPlayer apps, along with some games.Everything works great, but the MoboPlayer must be run in \"software\" mode (i.e. soft-decoding), however, because the default video player in the Quattro does not play most video formats (only the MoboPlayer works for me).There is no built-in equalizer for playing music, so you'll have to find an equalizer app as well if that is important to you.There is a mini-USB plug that doubles as a charger and a USB port for transferring files from your computer to the microSD card. No problems here.The device has both 3G/4G as well as wireless and Bluetooth capability. I have an unlimited data plan, but my speeds are better over my home wireless network, so I'm happy to switch back and forth.The headphone jack is a 3.5 inch standard size, not the mini 2.5 inch, so I can use it with regular headphones (including the ones with a mic).There are cameras on both sides, so conceivably this can be used with Skype. I have not tried that, yet, though. There is no auto-focus or exposure-control, however, so don't expect quality pics or videos (it will take both).The 4\" screen is very clear, both while watching Netflix and watching videos (using MoboPlayer). I have no complaints at all on that score.As to battery life, I extend it by turning off the GPS when I don't need it as well asd the wireless and Bluetooth, disabling a lot of useless background apps, turning down the screen brightness, and some other tweaks. All that stuff chews up power, after all.Overall I can not complain about this phone at all. We have 4 and everyone has ditched their (admittedly low-end) tablets for this.

Amazon has been one of the most used website to shop online. Most of the things people buy in local stores can now be found in Amazon.com. As a fellow online shopper there are many things you can buy like electronics, clothe, toys, kitchen ware, and more. The item I have recently bought is my cell phone called the CoolPad 4G LTE and it has been one of the best items I have bought online. Buying my cell phone online was one of the best choices I made. My cell phone has changed my life since the moment got it. A cell phone for many teens is a part of our lives and stands for us growing up. When my parents gave me my cell phone it was a time changing experience. Automatically I had the world at my finger tips I could talk to anyone or explore the internet at any time I wanted. My cell phone changed my entire life I was able to communicate with all my friends in minutes and talk as long as I wanted and even talk to family members that were far away. This cell phone changed my life being a teenager and having this experience was the best I highly recommend it for people and give it 5 stars. When I bought my cell phone I was not only looking for the ways it could change my ways of communicating but also its features. The Cool Pad has many different features that make it great. The life of the battery is very long lasting and charges fast when being in a hurry all you need is a few minutes. The screen is very durable and wide which helps for those who like to have everything spread out or even space to txt. Like all cell phones the memory is very good and holds many pictures and apps like games or entertainment. The one thing I cared the most about was that the internet was very good and fast which helped when it came to needing help in homework or a last minute study session. There are many fun and interesting things on the Cool Pad and it can be a life changing experience. It has helped me in many ways but comparing to other people who have had to change their cell phones often I haven't which I believe is important. My cell phone has been with me for over 3 years and I haven't changed it once. I have dropped it a few times but yet it keeps working very well and resisted being handled by my 5 year old brother which says a lot. There are a lot people who have the newest thing and in a few months getting a new phone because the phone screen broke or they dropped it and it doesn't function right. Having my cell phone for almost 3 years says the durable the phone is. Many people in my high school started having the same phone and was even seen as much as the iphone and was as popular. The Cool Pad has done a lot for my life especially in three years it has helped me connect with people I love and people I would like to meet. It has also helped me save money since I haven't had the need to change my phone to the newest thing. Having a cell phone can really help change a teenager's life. My Cool Pad is the best cell phone I have ever had, as every other person I did want the iphone or even the Galaxy but once I had my cell phone it was like having both of the phones without the expenses. Amazon has been the place to shop since I could remember and being able to buy a cell phone. The Cool pad has been the best thing I have a bought on Amazon and haven't regretted it since. I recommend the Cool Pad to all people of all ages. The phone you spend on this cell phone will be worth it.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Never buy this phone.", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "R2QKB9YRDXLH0G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I only had the phone less than 5 months and not only is the phone is horrible but the battery is too.

So I looked for an inexpensive smart phone that I could adapt to my needs. The Coolpad has worked nicely in that capacity.Note: I cannot comment on the Coolpad as an actual phone. As soon as it came out of the box I removed the sim chip which completely isolates it from the cell phone network. Wi-Fi meets all my data needs and I use a simple voice cell phone to talk & text for almost half the cost of the data plan.I'm not going to bore you with everything the phone does, Lots of others are covering that.For me the main selling point of this phone was the BIG screen. It was the thing that kept buyer remorse at bay.Why remorse? This thing only has 180 MB of ram!Before I got this thing I thought 256 MB was puny. Now, ... oh my oh my. If you're not familiar with the issue, the ram dictates how many apps you can ~install~ on the phone. That's right: not run at once, but install. All the rest of the memory is just storage for data. If you install too many apps the device starts to slow down. At the moment I'm using 163 MB and I'm constantly getting a dialogue box asking if I want to delete some apps.I like the phone. It fit well in my hand, it's fallen out of my pocket several times and is none the worse for wear. It works pretty well and is fairly quick.

That's with everything turned off except GPS (which comes right back on if I try and turn it off.) If I'm actually using it (i.e. talking or even playing game of solitare) I can run the battery completely down in less than 1 hour.- Dialing. Making calls from the contact list works as expected. If I try putting a number in from the keypad more than half the time I get the message \"The process android.process.acore has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again.\" It can take more than 8 tries before I can actually put in a number and make a call.- Memory. Want to download a bunch of apps? Forget it. You'll run out of memory. Even with a SD card, some apps simply won't install to it. There's several apps I'd like to run but can't.- Camera. Camera is adequate, but that's all. I haven't tried to record video.I've finally had enough. Tomorrow I'm going to the MetroPCS store and getting the LG Motion.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "sucks", "Author": "maria", "ReviewID": "R1FSHFMUD65F19", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this phone sucks ass! i've had this phone for at least 6 months.
