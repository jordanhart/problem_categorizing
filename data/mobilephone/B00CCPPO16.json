{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Android Smartphone", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "RXF4HZJAOI45Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first I was a little skeptical about buying an off-brand phone that cost quite a bit of money, but now I'm glad I took the chance! I couldn't be happier with this phone. The shipping took a while to get here but was right on time in the time that the seller had predicted. Upon opening the box, I was surprised at how big it actually was! The touch screen works perfectly and it has amazing color quality. The picture is very sharp and is very nice to look at. The body itself is very well constructed. I am a rancher and my job is often very demanding. This phone has held up well considering that I have dropped it in the dirt and have gotten caught outside in the rain storm with it! I'm very happy with that aspect so far. This phone has been very reliable for me as well. It gets good service wherever I go, and that's a big deal out in the country! The battery also seams to be good too. I can go most of the day without dropping the battery below 50% (that is without 4G/3G service). I have also found that the charging cord is a little short for it, but it is the same cord that the Kindle Fire uses so you can buy one of those to use. All in all, I really like the way this phone performs and the way it's constructed. I would recommend this to anyone considering it and I would definitely buy it again!", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too Hot too Hold", "Author": "Felicia Limbrick \"flim\"", "ReviewID": "R3H1M0157QV6T7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had my phone for a couple of weeks and my biggest complaint is it get extremely hot with usage of more than 10-12mins.  It heats up to the point that you have to remove the phone from your ear when in conversation.  Maybe this is a defective device?  Other than that (which is a big deal) the phone works extremely well, web browsing, texting, social media, email, google play store all work like a charm.  I may have to return it.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good quad core smartphone", "Author": "Bush wilsh", "ReviewID": "RB16UIS7N43GC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the \"inercon X920\" from my local store 10 days ago.Today,I found the price on amazon was USD85 lower than the local store.Oh,my GOD!But I like this phone very much!The phone is equipped with 5.0-inch IPS display, the screen resolution of 720P level, the display effect is very good. In addition, the built-in quad-core processor with 1GB of RAM to ensure smooth operation of the phone.The internal memory is 2GB---enough for me,but not big enough.The phone can support 32GB memory card---then,no problem now.I download some App from google play.all the apps run well.The OS is Android 4.2 which works very fast. Of course, I installed Angry Birds, the big HD screen makes it great to play.I found a few actual proofs show, the imaging results of this phone is quite good. In the case of a well-lit imaging clarity, color also performed well.The phone supports touch-focus function too.when I traveled to visit outside, i did get full HSDPA which is close to 7Mbps---amazing.The wifi and 3G is very stable.I can use it like a small tablet pc.As to a less than $300 quad core smartphone,it is a nice device.

The display is crisp and clear, performance is fine for everyday web browsing, watching videos, email and Office-type apps.  Sound is okay all around.  I can also get through a whole workday with moderate usage on the battery.  The camera cannot capture good pictures though despite the high resolution, the color accuracy and light sensitivity are both poor with somewhat fuzzy pictures being the rule.  Unfortunately the biggest weakness on this phone is the reception.  I am on Straight Talk AT&T; and so is my wife, while her phone works fine everywhere in our home, this phone needs to be close to the window in order to get reception.  Reception is  also spotty while I am out and about where my wife's phone works fine.  Unfortunately I may have to move on to another phone soon because I am sick of missing calls, and this will become a mini tablet to use with wi-fi.  If the reception was okay I would have given it four stars.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Seems Good", "Author": "Barney Lehrer", "ReviewID": "R326Y09LTUQRO6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Seems to work well.
