{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent unlocked smart phone for the price.", "Author": "Eliza", "ReviewID": "R237T5FMFVTEC0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this unlocked phone to see me through the rest of my current cell phone contract after my basic non-smart phone gave up on life. The main things that attracted me to this phone was qwerty keyboard, the price tag and the wifi capabilities. I don't currently have a data plan and didn't want to get one, but live in a city where there's free wifi readily available just about everywhere.I've had this phone for just over a week and here are my main issues:Wifi/3G:The first thing the phone requires you do to is to set up an Palm profile. The phone will automatically connect to 3G and uses data to do this. The phone also frequently checks for updates and if you set up your email through the phone it'll frequently check in to give you up to date emails. I bet these are neat features if you have an unlimited data plan, but if you have anything less than unlimited you should be aware of the frequent updates and backups that will drain your data and cause you to go over. This is apparently a common problem with AT&T.; You can turn off 3G and set the phone to wifi which is what I've done.Alarm clock:You can't sent alarms to go off on custom days. You can only choose ring once, daily, weekdays or weekends. In the end you have find an alarm app that will allow you to set custom days if you have any needs for custom alarms like I do.The alarm sometimes won't go off but will only vibrate, even when you have it set to make a sound. If you hit snooze the alarm does not sound when it goes off again but will vibrate only.When the alarm is set the alarm notification shows up at the bottom right of your screen, rather than the top left, like every other phone I've ever had, so you have to know where to look. If the screen locks and you unlock it there is a perplexingly large notification on the bottom of the your screen letting you know there's an upcoming alarm. I don't know why this is necessary.I ended up downloading an app to use as an alarm clock. I think it's kind of stupid that I have to find apps to replace the phone's built in functions.Vibration:I haven't found anywhere to adjust the strenght of the vibration. The vibration can be described as subtle, or discreet. It's weak to the point where I didn't feel the phone vibrating when it was on my lap while I was driving. Not being able to feel the phones vibration over the vibrations of the car is quite a drawback for me. This also means that when the phone is on the bedside table next to me sleeping head, quietly vibrating to let me know my snooze alarm is up, I don't hear it and oversleep for work. True story.Contacts:Once you have your email set up and download a facebook app all of your email and facebook contacts will automatically be imported to your contact list. Instead of having the 30 or so phone numbers of people I programmed in ready to go, I now have a list that's 100s of people long. The list just alphabetized - you can pick if you want it by first or last name, but it doesn't sub-categorize where the contacts came from. It would have been neat if it just had a little tabs for facebook/gmail/simcard or something. If you try to clean up the contact list by deleting all these extra people the phone will tell you \"facebook profile can't be deleted\". You can, when you have the contact card open go to preferences and set it to only show you names saved in your palm profile, or only names saved on your sim. I was really annoyed that it didn't ask permission or give any sort of notification about this mass importing of contacts. People I have as facebook friends only are there for a reason. If I wanted to call them I would have programmed their numbers into my phone to begin with. I read up about it and and app called Supercontacts was recommended as a way to manage this overload of people. Again, I think it's sort of ridiculous that you need an app to get your phone to be functional.Palm Apps:My only frame of reference is the apple app store we use for our Ipod touch. In comparison, this palm app store is cluttered and clunky and difficult to navigate. You can sort apps into \"hottest right now\" and \"new\" and alphabetical, but I really miss easily being able to pull up the top 100 free and paid apps. I miss being able to group apps into categories like you can on the Iphone/Itouch - instead you just have an endless list of stuff. It's harder to navigate and not really intuitive. It's hard to search for apps that do a certain function without knowing the name - the search doesn't autocomplete and start pulling up things that you might mean. I had to look as various online reviews and suggestions and then go back to my phone to look for those apps.The only other issue I have with this phone is that I wish I could have programmed it to have the screen wake up if I push any button. Currently you have to touch the power button to wake the screen and then drag the lock icon upwards to unlock the screen. This is fine, but I miss that extra bit of customizing that my old cheapo cellphone had.The phone is pretty fast, call quality is good and there's a good collection of preprogrammed ring tones. It's pretty easy to get used to although I had to look up what all the gestures were plus I didn't realize the black part below the screen was part of the touch screen and where you swipe to the left to go back/minimize.I'm happy I got this phone since it's a huge step up from what I had (LG Neon - would not recommend) but if I got this phone from a cellphone provider as part of a contract it would be going back for something that's a bit more streamlined and something where I can set custom days on an alarm clock. This phone taught me that not being able to set custom days is pretty much a deal breaker.Update: 01/2012: I've grown use to this phone and am enjoying it. The alarm function still sucks - even on the alarm app I downloaded it'll only ring when it first goes off and all subsequent snoozes are vibrate only. I can't be the only person with this issue, right?In the comments people asked about if it comes with a data cable. The phone had a cable that is a usb/micro usb in the box, with a wall attachment so you can charge the phone either by plugging it into the wall or your computer. It's the exact same cord the Kindle uses, incase you're not familiar with what a micro usb is. I haven't attempted to use this as a data cable, but when you plug it into a computer a message pops up on the screen that asks you \"charge only or usb\" and you can pick.My current cell provider is AT&T; and they did NOT require me to buy a data plan with the phone. They require you to get a data plan when you get a smart phone from them but apparently not if you just buy an unlocked one. The phone is branded AT&T;, and my sim card is with AT&T;, so I can't really say if the phone is actually unlocked. I assume it really is since there are reviews on there from people with different cell phone providers.I would recommend this phone if you're looking for a cheap compact phone with smart phone capabilities. I used the smart phone capabilities pretty infrequently, and I can get away with charging it only every other day. One of my favourite features is the qwerty keyboard for txting. The only issue I've had with it in all the months I've owned it is that the m of the palm emblem on the back of the phone peeled off. Nothing else. No problems with it freezing or switching itself off or dropping calls.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect Interim Phone", "Author": "dam151", "ReviewID": "R3T8EMAWA22PL7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have nothing bad to say about this item. While it is listed as an unlocked device, the unit cannot be used without a data plan UNLESS the palm account activation is bypassed. Hp/palm offers an activation bypass tool under their developer web pages that does this easily, after running some programs you must download. This process took me about an hour, and I was hesitant at first because the Hp/palm site stated that inactivated devices would lose SMS and Phone functionality (what good is the device without these?!). However, I believe that statement only applies to CDMA phone running an older version of webOS; I lost neither. The only loss for an inactivated device is access to the webapps, but if you're looking for a ton of apps, get an android phone or just develop them yourself.I got this item for $81, and it arrived the NEXT DAY with my amazon prime account. For that price, where else are you going to get an unlocked smartphone with a 600 mhz processor, 8 gb internal storage, 256 mb ram, and capacitive touch screen? Granted, the camera is lacking and the screen is on the small side, but for the price, who cares. Battery life is average; it went from 92 to 88 percent overnight, and 88 to 76 after 4 hours of moderate use (texting, brief browsing over wifi).Good product.UPDATE:Just Bought another after giving one to my sister and my SE Xperia X10 crashed (Not a phone I would recommend...)

It's pretty thin. Cheapest in it's category. WiFicons: Only supports up to WebOS 1.4.5 because of the old hardware. DOES NOT come with data cable. Does not have its own manual, instead it's packaged with the non \"plus\" model's manual, which happens to be CDMA, a major difference.Comments: Te phone it worth it, the old WebOS thing is a non issue since most new software is probably too resource hungry, in any case it's still better than a non-smartphone, and if you actually NEED a smartphone you should probably go for something with android or windows, for example. The packaging was crunched up when received, meaning that it served it's purpose in protecting the sweet sweet innards of the package. USB cable was absent, camera is so-so but better than nothing.tip: DO NOT format (erase all data) this device or else you'll have to jump some loops to make it work again. You'll either need a data plan to create an Palm/HP account, or use some Palm/HP software to bypass this. You DO NOT need a data plan for these phones, you just need to bypass the requirement.

I will make it clear if you're confused with the reviews regarding of the activation of the phone.===============================================THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED!However, to use the phone, you need to go through the activation process. There're two ways to do this. DO NOT try to activate the phone before you finish reading my review.Method 1: Using activation-by-pass tool provided by HP.I don't think I can post a web link here, but you can search \"Developing on an Unactivated Device\" on google to get the official description of the tool from HP. But when you follow the instruction of the web page, please notice that the method to go into recovery mode for palm pixi is a little bit different with other webos devices. Here's the correct way to get into recovery mode for pixi:(1). Turn off the phone;(2). Take out the battery and re-insert it;(3). Plug the charger into an AC outlet, but DO NOT plug the other side into the phone yet!(4). Press down the Volume up button,  without releasing the volume up button, plug in the USB cable into the phone;(5). DO NOT release the volume up button until you see a USB logo on the screen.(6). Unplug the USB cable from the AC charger, and plug it into your PC.You need to go into recovery mode, and then follow the instruction from HP to use the Activation-bypass tool. After this, you will be able to skip the first-setup steps of the phone required by Palm.However, I do not recommend this method to activate your phone since some issues cannot be solved:You will not able to use App Catalog (AppStore of HP). Which means that you can only install softwares in other ways. One is through \"WebOS Quick Install\" tool on PC side, the other is using \"Preware\" (Cydia on WebOS) on your phone. The key problem is that the original \"Google Maps\" installed on the phone is no longer usable, it requires an update. There'll be no way for you to update the Google Maps into Bing Maps without App Catalog, so you'll not be able to use Maps...Thus, I recommend the second way to activate your phone...Method 2: Use your friend's ATT sim card.Among setting up, simply plugging in an ATT sim card will make the first-setup steps go smoothly. After you created a Palm profile, you can then switch to your own sim card. The phone will still be able to use App Catalog even if you run the Activation-bypass tool after that.In all, this phone is perfect for such a good price.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Palm Pixi+", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "RV09MCI3B2WX2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an awesome little phone! Great touchscreen, keypad's a little small (totally fine for me, might be a problem for some people), sturdy, screen has a good size and is responsive, camera is good (I don't use it that much), and the operating software is great (webOS 1.4.5). Honestly as of now I don't see any cons except maybe for the WiFi (which is probably mostly attributable to me because I don't fully know how to work with it yet).

I found this Palm Pixi and read mixed reviews on whether or not it would work with T-Mobile, as well as several reviews on difficulty getting the phone started up and registered, etc. I took my chances and ordered this unlocked phone. When it arrived I took the battery out, put my SIM card from my T-Mobile phone in the slot, replaced the battery, and turned the phone on. I had to do about 2 minutes of registration with Palm, then it was up and running. It worked right away with no trouble at all! What a relief after reading the reviews. I was worried it might be difficult. It may have been easy for me, though, because I do already have a data plan so I didn't have to do anything special like turn data off. So I've been using the phone for a few days now and I am happy with it. There are a decent amount of apps, the camera is all right, call quality is good...it took me a bit to get used to the interface but you'll have that with any new phone.So, in summary, this phone IS unlocked when ordered from Amazon, and does work with T-Mobile hassle free.

You can turn the phone on, but you have to create a Palm Profile immediately before you can do anything else.  That wouldn't be so bad, except that you need to be on a 3G plan to create the Palm Profile.  If you don't have a data plan, you can't create the Palm Profile.  If you can't create the Palm Profile, you can't use the phone.You can edit a developer's version of the firmware, and use linux to load that onto the phone allowing you to bypass the Palm Profile creation.  But unless you're prepared to do that, this phone will essentially be inoperable without a data plan.  (But it is certainly possible.  If you're handy with linux and the command line, it's not really all that bad.)I imagine that you could start with a data plan to create the Palm Profile and then downgrade to a talk & text plan.

It came in yesterday and after spending an hour setting it up, I had no more worries. Physically, the phone is small and light, the complete opposite of the large 4.2-inch screen phone I had before. The keyboard, though small, works remarkably great and has a great clicky-ness to it. On the software-side of things, everything works great. Sometimes, things slow down, but rarely as long as you don't multitask too much.Regarding getting it up and going on T-Mobile, I searched \"1.x bypass\" on google and made my way to an appropriate walkthrough of bypassing the activation. I am on the more experienced side of computer and software fiddling, so it wasn't that hard. The hardest part, IMO, was getting the phone into recovery mode, lol.

I use T-Mobile in the US, and mainly use my phone to make phone calls. Thus, I didn't want to get a smart phone (from T-Mobile) and the associated data plan requirements so I decided to get an unlocked phone. I did decide that wifi would be a good feature to have if I didn't have to pay much more for it.What I like:One of the cheapest wifi unlocked GSM phoneThe phone works as advertised, makes calls, text message, and with wifi you can surf the internetIt is pretty light (3.2 oz), yet the screen size is decent size (2.6\" screen)It is easy to set up (once you get pass the bypass (see below!))Good battery life (2 days of moderate phone talking with data and wifi turned off)What I don't like:The phone ringer and vibration is weakThe phone screen dims randomly when you make phone calls (this is bad when you have to hit buttons like when you're entering keys for customer service calls)The phone is not as user friendly (no profiles, contacts are hard to organize, messenging detail is not well organized, waking up the phone is cumbersome) as my old Nokia.The camera is not goodI cannot comment on Apps since I have not been able to access the Apps store (I think I need a data plan for that). There is one useful Apps that comes with the phone that is useful but only work when you're connect to wifi (Google Map).Overall, for the price paid, I like this phone and would recommend this to somebody in my same position.------------Although this phone is relatively easy to use, the initial start of this phone is difficult. When you first turn on the phone and put SIM card in, the phone will try to activate through Palm (which I believe may force you to get a data plan but I'm not sure).

I'm trying to check something on the calendar - it freezes and reboots. I'm trying to make a call - it freezes and reboots. I'm receiving a text - it freezes and reboots.Some online research shows that I'm not by any means the only person having this problem. And sadly, there seem to be no answers. A few theories on what causes the problem, but no fixes.So, I've come up with my own fix. I've ordered a used Palm Centro. Should be here in a couple of days.

What can I say? It's a very good phone. Palm did an amazing job with WebOS. It's fast, responsive, and pleasing to the eye. For less than $90 you get an unlocked phone with a qwerty keyboard, capacitive touchscreen with multitouch support and wifi. Granted, the keyboard is rather on the small side, but if you don't have extremely large fingers you should do just fine. The processor is clocked at 600MHz. By today's standards that's not much but for a device this small it works perfectly.

Now, a few things need to be said about this phone. You need to create a palm profile the first time you turn it on. So you'll either have to use the by-pass tool offered in palm's website or find an At&t; sim card so you can create the profile.

Activation Bypassed\" and \"Show FirstUse App\",6. reboot the phone,7. set up wifi on the phone, which is going to be necessary in the next step,8. run \"First Use\" app that was intalled on your phone (see step 5.) to create your Palm profile and reboot,9. voila, your phone is fully functional, including calling/texting/wifi!", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Experience, but some tradeoffs", "Author": "j&b;", "ReviewID": "R2ZW87AFPV2FYR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "PROS-The phone is very light-the portrait qwerty keyboard layout, and just type functionality give very quick access to apps, contacts, web searches-application card metaphor works very intuitively for switching, arranging, dismissing apps-ringer switch is very convenient-Synergy on webos lets you pull and consolidate information from many accounts into the phone (yahoo, gmail, exchange)-notifications are unintrusiveCONS-so far battery life is poor, it barely makes the day with moderate use-the back of the phone gets hot after some minutes web browsing-the App Catalog is not available in some countries, based on the country where you activate your phone, not even for free apps-The phone is disabled when you connect it as a usb drive to the computer", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "WORKS WITH TMOBILE PREPAID SERVICE.", "Author": "Randy Johnson \"NO DOLLA\"", "ReviewID": "RO5BWGNFQ1C9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i read the reviews here at amazon before i brought the phone and was confused because nobody mention how the phone came. was it deliver in a oem or retail. then i figure out that it depends on which vendor u buy the phone from. and the reviews should also mention the vendor. because that makes a big difference. well i purchase my phone on amazon from the vendor \"best n price\". the phone was shipped very fast. recieved it way before the estimatated time frame that amazon give u. there was questions about what came with the phone. well my purchase came brand new in a box that said att on the box (retail). basically it was like i walk into a att store and gave them $399.99 and purchased this phone. the box was even still sealed. everything was in the box. phone, battery, wall plug, usb cable, manual, quick guide, etc. the phone and accessories was still in there oringinal packaging. as if i purchase this phone from att for 399.00. i do love the phone. i took my prepaid tmobile sim card out of my nokia and stuck it in this phone and followed some steps to create a account and that was it. i do have a data package on my prepaid service and thats probaly why it work so easy. didnt have the problems like some of the reviewers had. i even brought a extra battery for this phone on amazon so i wouldnt worry about charging the phone through out the day. and the battery was only $4.00. the only gripe i have about the phone and this is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because i install a few different programs (weather now, tripadvisor, google map,) that requires the use of the gps in the phone to update the location of the phone. for some reason its not working. depending on the program i use, it eithier say location not found or error. i did go into the the phone (location services) and turned on \"auto locate\" but i know there a problem. probaly a software glitch. i been on the internet researching but cant find nothing. i wonder if that the reason why these phones are being sold so cheap because of this issues. regardless its still a good deal for a back up phone or regular phone if your looking for a phone to place call, text message, and has a organizer for notes and to do or alarm clock or retrieve emails. also might want to install a free software called preware. it allows u to make minor changes to the phone and u can add some functionality also. for example i was able to add the date on top, by the time. remember to email the vendor that your planning on purchasing your phone from and ask what condition and what come with the phone. after reading some of the reviews on here, it sound like different vendors are shipping this phone different ways, with or with out accessorries, and in retail boxs and not in boxes (oem) so be careful when ordering this phone. i purchased my phone from \"best n price\". thank u best n price for a new, wonderful phone.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good user interface!", "Author": "AJ Massanga", "ReviewID": "R19OZ8KEX2FY02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to buy a non expensive smartphone that wouldn't let me down, bought this one as I've used an old Palm Pre with the big antenna and kind of like it.

This thing is amazing, it does everything my old Treo did, and much more.The wifi is great, everything can be sync to \"the cloud\", so you no longer have to keep your contacts on the phone's sim. I was able to sync my contacts with Google contacts, I was able to sync the built-in calendar with Google's Calendar, and I was able to POP my Gmail emails along with my Work emails into two different accounts, You can also IMAP them if you want, You can set up different rings for different accounts, etc.The best part is that with my Amazon rewards card, I had enough points to be able to buy this phone for $24 out of pocket. Not only that, but since it's unlocked, I was able to buy a SIM from StraighTalk (service that I love, and I've had them for about two years) for $14 shipped free, installed it in my PIXI, and for only $45 a month (no contract), I have unlimited data/texts/minutes.

To avoid data fees you need to either disable data on the phone or call the carrier to have them disable the internet.  If you disable data on the phone then multimedia messages don't work.

Not a big deal to me but it would be nice if the seller discloses this on the seller's posting.Now to the Phone:The phone is simply very CLASSY. It is originally an AT&T; phone but fully unlocked. We have T-mobile service with unlimited data in our family plan.. I did not have to go thru any extra setup or bypass instructions as mentioned by other buyers reviews.  Inserted my SIM card, it made me go thru some setup steps mainly username, password and email addresses and I was up and running in minits. Please be aware that this phone is NOT compatible with T-mobile 3G data service and will work only on the EDGE network (not a big deal for me or my son for what we paid for it). Synced gmail and all contacts came right to the phone. pretty painless. WiFi is a bonus, no problems setting it up. This phone is cute and tiny, just perfect for my 11 year old's tiny fingers (keyboard can be a little tight for someone with thick or fat fingers).. This phone is compatible with touchstone charging capability and I purchased the original touchstone back cover and the charger both less that $ 9.00 combined.

So, watch your bill because the autoactivation rakes up serious fee. This may have been why our phone registered with Palm even though we had no data plan. Still loving this phone a month later.<<<<<Just going to make some quick notes here to share the configuration tricks for T-Mobile and save you some major frustration. Love phone features but setup takes experience so if you are not willing to learn, forget this phone, you will be sending it back to Amazon anyway.If you ever had a Palm Pilot you will love this phone. Basically after setting up the Palm account you sync it to your PC or Mac desktop, Google or Palm cloud accounts using the Palm desktop software just like you would a Palm, that is the secret here. Just follow that logic.So here we go-- Phone unlocked for any carrier for sure so this not an issue- T-Mobile is not one of the carriers listed on HP for this  phone support cause T-Mobile doesn't sell Palm- HP now owns Palm, bought Palm in early 2010. HP needs to  do a better job marketing and phone support, but there is lots of good HP documentation but no place do they spell out the process so I am trying to that here to some extent.- Box and phone logo says ATT but it will work with others this is a good reason for an ATT and T-Mobile merger.- All the chatter about needing a data plan is confusing and misleading. All we needed was a SIMM card, mine was T-Mobile. Lets face it, most modern carriers use 3G which is all it takes to make a Palm account and that is in the documentation. You DO NOT NEED TO BUY A DATA PLAN. Maybe if you are in Iran you might, but we live in the USA which knows how to do technology the right way.- Palm account is easy to make, it is a cloud account to store your phoneinformation for backup and recovery you need and want that. If you already have a Palm Pilot account, try using that one, it may work with the phone and then you are in like flint. Be sure you have a few bars of signal, If you have a problem with signal, you know where to go to get a good signal and even show the 3G.-I'm replacing a T-Mobile , and Palm is not a T-mobile phone so you are on your own setting it up and transferring contacts, it will not show up as a personal phone in your My T-Mobile login.-To get T-Mobile Contacts search their site for how to export contacts, it is limed but workable. You basically select print contacts but before actually printing, cut and paste them to Excelfrom your My T-Mobile contacts login into Excel spread sheet and save the correct columns then save as a CSV file.-download the latest Palm Desktop Software and install there is Mac and Windows versions, when installing give the same name to the install user name prompt as you gave your Palm account when setting up. In the software click Contacts, go to file and import. Browse to T-mobile excel contact CSV file you made above in import. Look at contacts to be sure they came across. You can change viewing order later.-Plug in your Palm phone to the PC USB port now try a sync with your phone, it is just like the old days syncing your Palm Pilot. This is why it is important to have the same name on your palm phone and palm desktop software.-If that does not sync as hoped, download the HP Palm Data Transfer Assistant (DTA). It seems to port contacts and such even if the names do not match.- Only problem I had was if you had a Palm on your PC at one time, that name is still there and probably the contact data also and DTA can pick the wrong data, so be sure to have the PALM account name the same as the Palm Desktop software, it is easy to rename of make a new one.-If you set the wrong Contacts, do a Palm phone reset and set up the phone again using the same Palme account because you now have one from the first go around.-Be patient with all software and updates it is slow but once done things are speedy.That's basically it and if you can follow these instructions at all it will take about 1/2 hour.-My next project is to sync Palm to my Google contacts in the cloud.- Wireless is a snap--Mobile APPs are easy to read on screen-full size browser will be tiny but you can finger expand it-Read Manual to get case crack information and general operation notes.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Okay", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R2UCQQ8SS0YROR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Eh, give it 6 months till it gets fried.

I read on some other post, that this phone needs data plan to set up, (so you don't pay extra money just to set up the phone). When I first had it, it didn't need data plan to set up.  Overall the phone's decent enough, just some minor issues that I wanna point out.The calling feature is good. It is a touch screen but one needs to unlock the screen in order to answer.(unless the screen is already unlocked) So, you shouldn't need to worry about answering or rejecting a call by accident.  And it stores your calls real good. I have this phone for four weeks or so. It stores my calls from the first day I got it.The texting feature is quite bad. Though it stores all your conversation from every contact in your phone. It doesn't give you time. If you want to go back and look for a message, there's no way it can tell you what time you got it. or what time you sent it. If you send or receive the message today, it will give you exact time of when you send or receive the message. But when it's the next day, the messages from before will appear as yesterday. As time goes on, they will appear as last week, two weeks ago, three weeks ago and such. There's no way to tell what time or even what day you've gotten or received those messages.  It's pretty small thing missing on a smart phone, i found it ridiculous.The camera feature is bad. If there was enough light, and your hand don't shake. The pictures come out decent enough. But there's no way on this phone to adjust ANYTHING at all. When you open the camera app, it just gives a shutter and a flash to snap picture. There's no way to adjust brightness, contract, zoom-in, zoom-out. Nothing. You have a shutter and you're stuck with it.  I even have more option on my old basic phone.The video feature is okay, I'll say. But still it will be better if you can have control over SOME stuff.The battery life really isn't good. It takes away lot battery life when you turn it off(stand-by. not shut it down). I forgot to charge this phone one time and I had about 15% battery life left. I didn't use this phone for the whole afternoon and when I got home the phone was long dead. Talk on the phone for half an hour take away almost half of the battery. I don't even use the internet and I charge this phone constantly. NOTE: THERE'S A OPINION, \"LEAVE WIFI ON WHEN THE PHONE'S ASLEEP\" DONT CHOOSE THAT. You'll fall asleep with a fully charged phone and wake up with a dead phone.Other than that, I'll say the vibration of this phone is subtle, weak and close to nothing. You can put it right on your table in front of you while doing something and don't even notice it vibrates, let along put it in your purses or bags. You won't check a message or notice a missed call till half hour, one hour later. My suggestion is, if you have to put the phone on vibrate, check your phone constantly. Or just hold it in your hand. That's the only way you'll know when you get a message or call.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Was ahead of it's time", "Author": "Y.

He has used Palm in the past and they have a good track record with him. After just coming off using a Samsung Highlight T749, he wanted something with a touch screen and smartphone capabilities but he did not want to spend a lot of money. So after extensive research he settled on the Palm Pixi Plus and so far he is glad he did. If you are familiar with palm, which has always been more smartphone, business friendly, then the set up and user interface will not bother you; if not, I would suggest a brand with a much easier user interface. I will not go into specifics about the phone because all that has been said. What I will review is how well it works with the T-Mobile network.First the phone, while unlocked, is an AT&T; branded phone; so some settings might have to be manually unlocked to use. Second, while it does not require a data plan because it is an unlocked phone; data is required to set the phone up. We do not subscribe to data on the phones because we have other devices like tablets, so words of caution......do not try to set up account using WiFi with T-Mobile because they will still charge you. We have exceptional WiFi in our home and never lost a signal, the excuse T-Mobile used as to why we were charged. So if the reason you are purchasing this phone is the WiFi, be careful if you have T-Mobile. He also had to change the MMS settings to get it to work. The call quality is good and the basic functions of the network work fine: no drop calls, fast text, IM's, and picture messaging. The picture/video quality is okay but the alarm function leaves a lot to be desired.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice phone except for initial setup without data plan", "Author": "Tony A", "ReviewID": "R2HB5RWI74KL2U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The unlocked Palm Pixi Plus is probably one of the best deals out there in terms of all the features you get for the price you pay. The phone looks built with quality and is very thin, thinner than the original Motorola RAZR. You can certainly put it in your pant's front pocket comfortably. The phone's back cover is made out of rubber which protects the phone from scratches and impacts even on its sides. The Palm user interface is elegant and intuitive. The keyboard is on the smallish side but the keys are easy to feel due to their 3D profiles. Most people have problems getting through the initial setup on this phone if their service does not include data. This is because the phone requires that you set a palm profile requiring this capability. The easiest way around this is to borrow for 5 minutes a SIM card from a friend that does have a data plan. This would allow you to complete the initial setup after which you can turn the phone off and put in your non-data-plan SIM card.

The touch screen is great too, very quick response and I like the light sensor that dims it when you're in the dark and brightens when you're in bright light, saving battery and then making it easier to see.The only complaint I have is the battery life, I do have to charge it every night but tha's after very heavy use of the internet, texting, using apps, and taking pictures all day :P It makes up for it by taking very little time to fully charge again though.Anyway, great phone for a great price!

Following the advice of another recent review on this phone, I asked my roommate if I could borrow her SIM card, because she has data. Using the SIM card with data, the phone could activate and get set up, and then I put mine back in and it has been working fine.

In short the phone is good, but not great, at what it is supposed to do. However, what it is supposed to do is quite extraordinary at this low of a price point. The screen is limiting such that it's best for limited, occasional use to look things up or see a youtube video. I wouldn't want to watch a whole movie on it or browse the web for an extended period of time because it is so small. The multitasking works, but it sometimes slows down. If found that overclocking the phone helped quite a bit with relatively little loss to battery life and no stability problems, so this is something I recommend. The notification system is excellent and works flawlessly. The app store works well, there are enough apps to get by with one's needs but not enough to be impressed. The keyboard is great and comfortable, and the device is aesthetically nice. I find that WebOS is really quite polished, and has some nice keyboard shortcuts.  The camera is low resolution but still much better those of dumbphones. Basically, you are getting a feature rich smartphone which is really only held back by it's weak processor, small screen, and relatively small app ecosystem. You don't get what you pay for, you get much much more than that. Still, users looking for a smartphone with the specs of a current gen iphone or android device should look elsewhere.I bought this phone with looking to set it up with gophone prepaid 10 cent per minute plan, no data. There was a lot of talk about problems activating the phone because it uses data to do so. I read up on the possibility of doctoring it to get past the activation screen, but I did not want to do this because Palm stated this would prevent phone, text, an data usage. IE, it would just be a wifi device.Here was the solution, I bought a cheapo gophone from radioshack with a sim card in it and put it in the pixi. The shopkeeper activated it for me, but it is possible to do this online at [...]. I added 25 dollars of regular minutes to my plan, and also added 5 dollars of data for the activation. As soon as the phone was activated, I used the palm pixi settings to turn off data, such that it would only be a wifi device with phone and texting. Also, I gave everybody my Google Voice number instead of the gophone number, and set it up with Google voice in order to be able to send texts for free when in wifi range (which I am most of the time). I recommend the Voogle app for WebOS, it's not perfect but it works. Naturally, using Google voice is completely optional.

I love it, i made it a prepaid cell phone with at&t; Gophone service. I had promblems setting it up, and passing the palm setup program but it no problem at all. Some people said that you could use a friend's at&t; sims card to bypass the palm setup screen with using their 3g. Well i tried that and it didn't work. I went to at&t; store and ask for help about setting this phone up with pre-paid. He use his at&t; contract sims's card so i could use his 3g so i could setup up my account with Palm Services. IT DIDN\"T WORK! I even repeated the process with using my brother at&t; pre-paid sim's card. SAME PROMBLEMS. So using a friend's at&t; sim's card is not the best thing to do. He told me the reason why was that every time you buy a new phone and get a new sim's card. That sim's is locked to that phone. So that might be the reason why that method did not work. I had promblems with setting up my fone for about two days. One day i was using hp(palm customer service) and chatting with a representaive for questions on how to bypass the Palm setup because my information i was giving would not go through so he told me to try the process again(at this time i had my at&t; sim's pre-paid card in). It did work! It went through. So if you have promblems setting it up call the toll number Palm has so you can get help. Other that that, this phone is great.

Have a data plan with you service.2. Have the sim card inserted prior to booting up.3. Try registering, or singing in into your WebOS account. (registration will fail as it will be unable to connect to the internet)4. After a couple of tries, WebOS will point out that it is unable to connect and below the message it gives an option to change the network settings. Click this option.5. There are 3 options on the following screen. Under Access Point, or Internet APN, type: simple. Leave user name and password blank. If you are using another carrier, you must find out what their APNs are. I know t-mobile has several APNs and you might have to try with different ones. H2o uses att.mvno as APN with no user name or password as well.5. After registering the phone, or singing into WebOS, you will see your desktop. Once there, open the Dialer. Click on the carrier name on the upper left hand side of the screen, and click preference. Under Network, click Edit Network Settings and then click MMS APN tab.Under MMS APN tab, type simple under MMS APN, leaving black user name and password. Under MMS Properties enter: [...] (you must find out what the MMS properties for other carriers are and type it here, the one listed is for simple mobile)Under MMS Proxy enter: 216.155.165.050:8080 (again, see above for other carriers)Under Max Size enter: 300.Finally clicking Change Settings.  There might be an error message with the APN change, however, there will be an option to confirm the change below the red text. Confirm the changes by clinking on Set Up Anyway.6. Last thing to do, is to go back to the dialer preferences, and under voice mail number, change the number to: (805) 637-7243 and you will have a fully functional phone using simple mobile. You might need to find out the voicemail number for your carrier in order to access your voice mail from the dialer.In regards to the Palm Pixi Plus, I am enjoying the phone! I sold my G2x in order to give WebOS as a phone a try. I already have an HP Touchpad and I was impressed with how well everything worked out of the box. I started with Android with their first phone, the G1. Within 4 months I moved to IOS (apple), and I was a user for over a year. I then tried blackberry for like a week, and went back to Android for the last 2 years. Not sure why, but I really like WebOS over Android and probably IOS. I guess it has to do with multitasking, and probably with the physical keyboard. One of my biggest complains in Android is how many keys you have to press in order to call someone. Even if you press the search key, you press a lot just to call someone. With the Pixi, just start typing a name and a couple of clicks, and done. Multitasking in android is done by hard pressing on the home screen for a couple of seconds. Then you would find that somehow the app had closed and you had to start from zero. I guess android closes the apps after several other are open! It was annoying not finding the app as you left it. With WebOS and the pixi plus, if the app is open it will be there when you go back to it as you left it, and multitasking is always just two clicks away. The notification system is somehow android like, without having to pull the bar down. Just press the little icon below and notification are shown. Press on the notification, and takes you to the app.My biggest complain with the Pixi Plus and WebOS, is their map app. Simply put, it is not google maps. It does not behave as google maps on android, and it useless! It is Bing Maps, and although it finds where you are and gives you directions, it does not guides you. It does not have a  \"from point to point\" click option for one to follow the directions either. You have a list view, and an overview to the whole map. There are also no apps on the market for GPS guided directions, that I have seen.Screen Size is small, specially for me that my last phone had a 4\" inch screen. However, everything behaves so well that it has not been an issue. The Mail App is great. I would say it is even better than the Gmail App for android. You can set all kinds of accounts, and have favorite folders for easy access to them. All your accounts in one app! In Android, I had the Gmail App, The Regular Mail App, and the Hotmail App. So a lot more switching apps in Android! Inside an e-mail, the apps shines. It displays all pictures and everything as you would see in a computer. It is great! Messaging app combines MMS/SMS with other Messaging accounts as well. It works great too as you have two tabs, one for MMS and SMS and the other for AOL, Google, etc. So not switching between apps for messaging either.The phone runs great on Simple Mobile over Edge Network (which is t-mobile). Simple Mobile's $40 plan limits its 3G speeds to around 125KBit/s, and I am getting about the same speeds over Edge. Using an App from the WebOS market called Net Speed, I averaged 148.6KBit/s on 3 tries. So I am actually gaining Internet speeds with the change from the 4G G2x! .My last point, is price point. I purchased this phone, with the touchstone dock and touchstone cover, for under $100. That is a great deal! All this technology at this price point, is crazy! I know WebOS is hanging by a thread, but so far HP has shown me that they somehow care for the product. They updated their Maps app a couple of days ago, and have given free paid apps for the touchpad. They have also issued a couple of updates to the touchpad after the news. So they know this is a great OS that people just don't know, and with deals like these, more people will know! There is a good community of people designing patches (preware) to improve WebOS, and that adds up to the value of the product. Patches like adblocker, full screen browser, just add value to the OS.I would highly recommend this product to anyone. I did not have a budget to acquire my next cell phone, and I decided for the Pixi Plus based on the experiences with the touchpad and the overall value of the whole package. I spend a good amount of time writing this review in hopes that the information is useful to someone and in turn for WebOS to somehow have future as more people get to experience the OS.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Phone.

Using an unlocked GSM phone allows me to use a local carrier in each country and avoid the ridiculously expensive international data/voice roaming charged by US carriers.  At only $55, it can quickly pay for itself vs. international roaming charges.I have used this phone in several countries in Europe without an issue.  To use it I just bought a SIM from a local wireless carrier and put some money in my account  (usually $20-$30 was enough to get a 500mb-1GB of data and more voice minutes than I could use).  In Europe I was able to get HSPA data rates in some places and voice quality was excellent.In the US, I picked up a SIM from T-Mobile and have signed up for the \"daily use\" plan where you pay $5/day but only if you use the phone.  This effectively makes the phone a great emergency phone or a good loaner phone for a visitor as you only pay for the day that you use it.The phone itself is a pretty basic smartphone.  Palm, the company that made it, is effectively out of business so there is no support available and the software is no longer being updated.  That said, it's pretty easy to learn how to use everything and in my experience the phone has been very stable and reliable.I would not recommend this phone as a primary phone for heavy/daily use.  It's not that fast and the battery will wear out by the end of the day if you use a lot of data.The positives of this phone:- Very cheap for an unlocked GSM smartphone- Very good email client that syncs email with MS Exchange (mail/contacts/calendar), GMail, Yahoo, etc.- Nice keyboard for inputting texts and emailThe negatives:- You have to activate the phone before using it and that can be a bit of a pain in the neck if you don't already have an account with a GSM carrier (AT&T; or T-Mobile).  Make sure to do this before you take it overseas.- The Palm OS has very few apps for it outside of the basic ones.  If you require access to mobile apps when you travel, this is not the travel phone for you.- No Google Maps or for that matter any mapping application at all (outside of web browser).

She wanted a smarter phone, or rather, I wanted her to have one so she could text me. I knew she needed one with a qwerty though, since she had never used any touch screen before. I got it yesterday and am setting it up for her, but so far I really like this little guy. It takes a while to get started, the boot up is a few minutes long. I have a Nexus 4 for myself and obviously it outpowers this guy like an elephant versus a guinea pig, but honestly, I find this phone quite charming and really wish I could keep it, lol. I would not mind having this phone as emergency back up in my bag if I go out and am afraid my real phone might get stolen. The battery life does suck, but I have an external battery that I will give to her as well. I like this phone over all and would say for an older user who has never had a smart phone before, this one would be a good starter because it's still very basic and not overwhelming but still very attractive and quite nice to use.

SO much easier and accurate to type with than a touchscreen keyboard!This is more of a low-end smartphone; you can browse the web, download apps (webOS 1.4.5), email, and more, but it's slow on wifi. Maybe it's different on a data plan? I use the screen and apps to listen to music and keep pdfs of bus routes on hand more than anything else. Using apps like the camera all the time drains the battery pretty quickly too, so it's better for light usage -- if I'm just texting and using apps every once in a while, my phone lasts about a day and a half, sometimes even more.EDIT (1/11/14):So the phone died this week. Lasted almost a year and a half. In that time, I had to replace the back cover once the flap over the charger fell off, but that was about it.

The screen & keyboard size is perfectly acceptable and usable, infact I'm writing this review from my palm pixi now. I love the keyboard, the screen has a great look to it, web browsing is easy and fun, and the gesture area and multi-tasking make it a true smartphone. I like to show this phone off and make my friends jealous. Texting is great and the app store is good.

Turns out it runs much more efficient on AT&T; than T-Mobile, I get 2 1/2 days of battery life on ATT and was barely making a day on T-M. Not sure why but since it is an unlocked AT&T; phone there must be a connection. The screen is clear and sharp, and the touch screen is perfect. Since Palm was the first company to make consumer products ( Palm Pilots ) with a touch screen, this is just another thing they do best. I use my cell phone primarily as a phone and text device. The Pixie does this very well, and the WEB OS synchronization also works well for my other needs.  Again Palm has been in the business of synchro longer than most if not all.

I took a bit of a risk after reading reviews about the trouble with setting up this phone, but I was in need of something simple and reasonably priced.Regarding the set up - some reviews tell you that you can research \"1.x bypass\" instructions, which I did, but upon further research, I discovered that without registering the phone with Palm, SMS, MMS and calling would not work, the phone would only be good for wi-fi related tasks.  When I turned on the phone, it prompted me to create a palm profile and provide an account email.  In order for the phone to verify your email, you DO need data!  I have t-mobile, so I simply called and requested the smallest data package I could get, the cost was $5 for one month of data, and I can cancel it whenever I wish and only pay for the data used.  I restarted the phone and did the process again with very little trouble (just make sure you have at least 3 or 4 bars of service)!I have had the phone for 2 days now, and I absolutely love it!

I don't do contract phones anymore so I look for the best inexpensive phones. For just $68.00, I found what I was looking for in AT&T;'s Palm Pixi Plus.  I have a data plan with T-Mobile so when I inserted my sim card and powered on, the set up was a breeze. I love this phone for its design and features. The pocket sized phone is small, thin, and lightweight and fits nicely into the palm of my hand. The cover is durable, fits snugly and is easy to remove and replace.The touchscreen is super, better response than some more expensive phones I've had. Gentle taps and finger flicks are all that it needs.  This is great design and easy to get used to.  Even though the keyboard is in a small space, it works just fine. I got frustrated with the virtual keyboard on the touchscreen of my other phone. I made too many mistakes, even with swyping.Palm Pixi Plus works great with my home Wi-Fi connection, excellent speed. I couldn't get Wi-Fi to work in my workplace, though because there is no way to set a proxy.I mostly use my Bluetooth earphone and get good sound quality. You can choose different ringtones and backgrounds but choices are limited. I do wish the vibration function was strong; I only notice vibrate when the ringer has no bars (same as mute). I like that a caller's photo fills the whole screen; the screen is not huge, just over 2 inches, but big enough.  I was able to transfer pictures from a media card as this phone can work like a storage device when you connect it to a computer with a USB cable. You can also charge the phone this way.I purchased the touchstone charger because it's so easy to use, no fiddling with plugging the cord into the phone. I had to buy a charging cover too but the accessories were inexpensive on Amazon.For the reading challenged, the phone comes with short animated video clips on how to operate its features - a picture is worth a thousand words.I can get up to 8 hours and my charge would probably last longer if I didn't rely on Bluetooth. I keep a car charger and one at work. I always charge overnight.I'm okay with 2G speed. I don't use the phone as my primary device for surfing the internet, watching movies, as an alarm clock or as my primary camera. I also don't use it to keep my calendar on. The Pixi Plus doesn't have a ton of APPS but that is fine by me. I'm not willing to pay for AT&T;'s navigator service and wish there was a better Maps APP available.

I reccommend Installing preware and overclocking to 800mhz, as the stock 600mhz processor is a little slow for a lot of modern apps. WebOS is a great OS, and It is disappointing that they killed the program, as I loved the UI and easy to use style. Screen is small compared to today's phones, but great and responsive, and also not glass, so you won't have to worry about cracking it or dropping it at all. I do recommend using the Touchstone back and wireless charger, as the charging port door is a pain to open, and after awhile, the magnet that holds the door on came off and it just sat open. Selection of apps is fair to poor at best since, as mentioned before, the WebOS project was killed off by HP a year or two ago, so many developers have stopped working on apps for this platform. Overall, this was a great phone. Unfortunately, I got scammed out of it on a trading site, and was unable to retrieve it, and am now using an iPhone 3GS as my daily driver.

Whatever about Apps, if it can take a dive across the family  room and live, it gets two thumbs up from me.The first miraculous recovery we witnessed was after a nice long dip in the pool. With horror I pulled the soaked phone out and started looking up iPhones as a replacement. In the interim, I put the entrails of the Pixi out in direct sunlight to dry off. Doesn't hurt to try, right?Lo and Behold, I put the pieces back together that night, and it hopped back into action with it's deathly slow start-up screen!Our most recent scare was the result of our 4 year old pocketing the phone with his other 'important stuff'. We had ridden bikes all over the neighbourhood, so we considered it a total loss this time. After two rainy days, the guy two houses down discovered it on this lawn. We wiped it down and unbelievably, the Pixi powered up! At first the camera was blurry, we could see bubbles on the 'lens' area, but they dried up. It is back in action!I didn't realise how much I like this phone until it was gone.I am not a big techie, but the Palm Pixi Plus is a smashing choice if you are a busy parent. You can snap all the fun moments, take little videos, and text with ease. I don't utilise it to the full extent, but it is a fantastic budget option.(If you are not a heavy user, or have a house phone, I would suggest pairing this with the T-Moblie $30 per month 1500 Talk/Text plan. It comes to $33 or so after tax. I was paying $65 per month for my mobile before I switched.)As I said at the start of the review, most of the electronics we have don't stand the test of time. The Palm Pixi Plus, on the other hand, is a gem.Hope this helps!", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "PHONE FROZE AFTER FIVE MONTHS", "Author": "Siscaluv", "ReviewID": "R1VFLONSRNF4Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my husband but after about five months of use, the phone would not work again.

However, contrary to what someone else posted, ATT detects this as a smart phone.  Initially for the first couple of days my wife and I used it on ATT while transitioning to Straight Talk.  Within a day both of us received a text from ATT that they detected a smartphone and we needed to come in and sign up for a smart phone plan or they would pick one for us.We now use the phones with Straight Talk and that takes some finagling to get Internet.  You have to open the dialer and click on the upper left corner of the window, select preferences then edit network setting.  I set the APN to att.mvno and the MMS proxy to what it says on the Straight Talk web site.  It won't like it when you try to save changes but tell it to set it up anyway.  Once it did it started going to the web.  Several of the icons on the browser are dated and don't work so you will have to rebuild them.Update: I really like some of the apps.  The trip advisor app allows you to hit a \"nearby\" button and it uses gps to identify local restaurants and hotels and gives you reviews.  YPMobile does something similar and it pops up a map too.  The Facebook app imports all of your friends into your contacts and that is a mixed bag, some ways I like it some ways I do not, I guess I like it more than not since it allows me easier access to emailing them. The phone does much better than the other smart phone I had on the battery.  This one easily makes it through the day and I do much more with it than I ever did with the pantech.

Don't feel cheated if you order this phone for AT&T.; The one thing many reviewers point out that you should know is you need data in order to activate the phone. Without data service the phone will not be able to verify status on the palm network. The line I got this for is not on data, so I simply took a sim card that had a data plan on it, placed it in the phone for the first turn on, let it do the motions, took the sim card out, placed the data free sim card in the device, and sure enough, works like a charm!

One big downside is the volume of the ringer, it is pretty low, even at the loudest setting.  I have read that this is due to the ringtone files originally created at a low volume setting (Hz).

I read from other reviews that there are two ways to activate the phone and setup a PALM profile because it cannot be activated using WI-FI for the first time. One way is to bypass the activation process using developer's resource kit and the other way is to borrow a friend's SIM card with a data plan on it.I used neither of them because I subscribed to T-Mobile's $10/month 200MB plan just for one month(I can cancel it anytime I want)after I got this phone. I'm pretty sure you can just setup your phone using the Pay as You Go plan which is $1.99 per MB, and I found out that I only used less than 0.2MB after the initial setup.Using itAfter the initial setup, you can turn the data usage off to avoid being charged for data fees, and you can still use the wi-fi.This phone requires some google efforts to get familiar with the navigations and functions such as how to delete an icon and move apps to the quick launcher. I didn't really like the function of dragging an app from one launcher to the next one.There are not a lot of apps available for this phone in the Apps Catalog but it does have Facebook, Spotify, Pandora, and AccuWeather.Web browsing on Pixi using Wi-Fi is very fast comparing to the Nokia smartphone I used to have. I have not encounter a web page that I couldn't accessed, but you cannot download files with the built-in browser, at least I haven't discover how to do it yet. And, you cannot used an alternative browser such as Opera Mini, and there isn't one available anyway.Note that you cannot use wi-fi for GPS; the GPS is not working so well anyway because T-Mobile customers can only accessed it with EDGE instead of 3G, which slows loading the maps. Also for some reason, Google Maps is no longer usable in this phone after the initial update of maps. I do not recommend buying this phone because of its GPS.VerdictFor reasons like screen quality, call quality, build quality, and browsing speed, I give this phone a four-star.

I own a Nokia N8 so Symbian was out of the equation, then I got left Windows Phone, Meego and WebOs. Since this WebOs phone is a lot cheaper that any Meego or Windows Phone I saw, I went for it, after all I was searching for a backup phone.So, I received the phone and the first thing I saw was the at&t; logo on the box, the phone and all written materials. The phone came brand new (with the particular smell new items have) with the wall charger and the data cable. The size is perfect (even the keys on the keyboard could have been a bit bigger) It feels very good in the hand and it's not heavy at all. The screen has a good size and responds very well to touch. It also seems to have the Touchtone back cover but I will test it as soon as I receive the Touchtone charger I ordered.Upon powering on (which takes a while) it asked me to create a palm profile in order to use the phone. I am currently not in the US (in Central America) so I don't have an at&t; SIM, so I was affraid there would be some kind of issue with that based on some reviews I saw. I even had the link ready to do the Bypass activation thing, but it was not needed at all! The profile created correctly and I was able to use the phone with no trouble at all (Maybe it's because here the 3g frequency is 850Mhz same as the one AT&T; uses?)I have a prepaid card with a data plan so I used it to create the profile.I am playing around with it, still at the learning curve.

It's an unlocked smartphone (with apps, multitasking, camera with LED flash, etc.) that you can use on any GSM carrier.  The one I received had an AT&T; logo on it, but when I put in a T-Mobile SIM it worked just fine.As far as the hardware is concerned, you are definitely getting a lot for the money.  The touchscreen is pretty crisp and responsive (although it is a bit small for my taste).  The keyboard is also pretty tiny, but it is functional.  The camera takes OK pictures and has a pretty nice LED flash (my 3GS doesn't even have that).The software is also very easy to use.  It is centered on multitasking with the cards interface.  Every app launches as a card that you can then switch between or flick off the screen.  The included apps work pretty well and you can download more from the HP App Catalog.  Overall, the software was pretty responsive (I only noticed a few brief slowdowns).Overall, I think you would be hard pressed to find an unlocked smartphone with all these features at this price.  Just make sure that you are on a GSM carrier (like T-Mobile or AT&T;).

The REAL problem with the alarm or event calendar is even if you have stuff set to ring sometimes it will only vibrate so you wont wake up or hear it.  AND sometimes it wont even vibrate.  Occasionally I would see something out of the corner of my eye... just my screen saying my alarm is going off no ring or vibrate.  It's caused me to be late to work and other events.  Nowadays if you buy a smart phone it should at minimum be able to do simple $5 alarm clock functions.  If you travel and dont always stay at hotels you might want to bring an alarm clock - I would have my friend call me some days when I really had to be up for something just incase. which brings me to my next issue~Sometimes even in an area where I have full bars I wouldn't receive calls. I'd just get a beep I had a new voicemail or occasionally nothing until either that person called me again or I happened to call them for something and they'd ask why I didnt call them back earlier.... simply b/c the call never came through.  The same thing would happen to my bf.  If we called eachother and the other didnt answer we'd call back at least 2 more times to make sure it wasn't just a phone error - more often than not it was.  Haven't had this issue with our new phones... PALM PROBLEM.~Adobe isn't updated so while it has a version it doesn't work on any of the sites I use. (as of a month ago)~Phone locking up frequently when merely trying to do something simple such as sending a text or placing a call.  You cant get the phone to just turn off and restart using the button either - you have to remove the battery. (which you cannot easily do with the pixi. on the pre it's easier)~The bf's phone was so quiet when on max volume he had to use speakerphone to speak to people (my phone didnt have this issue - just his)~When upgrading to our iphone and razr phones we've had FAR fewer dropped calls and rarely any \"what did you say your phone cut out\" problems.~There are far fewer apps for this phone which isn't a big deal as far as games go, but shopping list apps and dieting/exercising apps, and others are things that really simplify your life and can make chores fun.~Sometimes it is unable to answer a call, place a call, or use the internet which would last from a few minutes to several hours and my cell provider says there shouldn't be any issues. Oddly enough text both incoming and outgoing remains working during this time. Restarting the phone makes no difference.  Eventually it just works again until then text is your friend. (no problems with this since getting better phone but previously had this issue at least once/month)~Using the internet for more than one or two short things/day requires you to clear the history every or every other day as your internet will just not load any pages.  If you clear the history and reboot the phone it works fine again. (have unlimited data - dont have this issue on razr/iphone so it's not the provider)~Rebooting the phone takes several minutes. Turning on the iphone/razr is substantially quicker.... I could go on, but unless someone pays me for a book deal I'd just be writing one for free.You get what you pay for.  If you can manage to hold out for a while longer until you've got more money saved up you'll be much happier with several of the andriod options out there (or dare I say it an iphone - not my preference but I'd use the original iphone over palm pre or palm pixi any day).The pre is the same OS and technology as the pixi and has the same issues only more problems with its screen shorting out.  It's merely a slide out version of this phone so the whole front is a larger screen.The whole reason I got a Palm was because I had a Palm PDA before smart phones came out years ago and it was wonderful. I dont think I will ever buy Palm products again. This is the only phone I've ever not be happy I purchased.  I got it for $100 WITH a case, car charger, phone screen covers, headphones and bluetooth from my cell company when I signed 2 year contract. The price is this cheap now for a reason.Verizon here is no longer carrying Palm phones is what I was told when I went to get a new phone (which i got before my 2 year contract was up b/c I just could't use the phone any longer).  The man working there told me it was because they had so many \"defective\" phones being returned just days after purchase & more phones returned in the first few months they had to replace with new or refurbished. He also said that they had a lot of unhappy customers who purchased palms and wished they'd shelled out more money for a better phone.  Yes they're salesmen they'll agree with me and they want to sell higher dollar phones, but I hadn't told them what phone I even had yet when I got there.  When they asked to help me I said do you guys not carry palms anymore b/c I dont see any on your shelves.

There are much better Androids out there!This particular one, bought from Amazon reseller, had other issues as well.Power on? - It turns on.  Then it stays there, on the Palm logo screen, and stays there ... like ... for ... ever.  Seriously.  For 15 minutes I couldn't figure out what's going on.  I removed the battery, re-start, same thing.  Then I start to randomly press whatever keys I can find ... and suddenly, I am prompted to enter some APN numbers.  Don't have them, but can't get off that screen.  Tried pushing random keys again.  After I finally get it to be normal Palm interface, with a sim card inside,  I power off.  I start again.  Same thing! ... I can't figure out how to start this normally without randomly pushing buttons and hoping for a miracle.Battery Power: Wow, is it short!  I literally fully charged the phone, have it sit on my desk (with all syncs turned off), for 24 hours.  Then the battery bar is red and I can't make a call.  Its standby time, while doing nothing, is 24 - 36 hours, that's all!  That's below spec by any standards.Packaging - I think this is a new phone or refurbished.  But it is definitely not in original packaging.  Manual is \"sprint\", poorly printed (like a fake one), but phone is marked \"AT&T;\".  Charger is there, new looking.  It does appear to be unlocked.Usability: Again, the major draw is that it is a Palm phone.  But because of sync issues, it has no advantage over comparably priced Android phones.  Try LG Optimus One P500.  The screen is very small.  The physical keyboard also very small.  If you have good eye sight and very good fine-motor skills, perhaps.  Else, you risk looking silly trying to see and work this phone.  Inconsistent reception ... I sit in my chair, and the signal bar would go up and down.  I have a dinosaur Motorola \"dumb\"-phone ... and the same sim card shows 5 bars all the time.  WIFI seems to work well.  And it stays with the WIFI network in the house when I walk around.Verdict: Returned the phone after three days to Amazon, for power-on issues and incredibly poor battery life.  Thank goodness for Amazon so I can buy/return with confidence.

When I see the blackberries I'm amazed that smartphones so old as my Treo are so much better (just my humble opinion). I bought two Pixis one for me and one for my wife. We were so excited, I just had a little concern with having to register with Palm (HP) to be able to use the smartphone. I placed my SIM into the Pixi, followed the simple steps to create my profile and voila my Pixi was ready to use, but I had a great problem afterwards. When I tried to configure the second Pixi I wasn't able, because my Pixi wasn't able to connect to the carrier's Data Service (3G). I tried with many other SIMs, I went to the carrier offices to enable my data plan (but I had been always enabled), and I talk with Palm (HP) customer service and told to follow some steps (which I did, and included to reset the smartphone with WebOs Doctor) and told me that if this didn't work out I had to send back the smartphone for a refund or new one.

The only thing I can do is call people, and that's only because before it broke I put a pin code password on it, so when I turn it on I can type in the pin code on the key pad, when it's plugged in. If it's not it makes me have to pull up the lock and considering my screen is broken I can't really do that. So when it's plugged in right away it shows me to put in my code.
