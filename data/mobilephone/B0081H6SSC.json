Awesome touch screen it includes an sd slot which is great for when I download all the music I haveThere are no cons to this phone;works perfectly!I suggest if ur giving this to a teen buy a case and screen protectors.  The phone is heavier but it's not really a problem it has a stylish look more for a girl than a guyIt has 2 touch screens which is great and this phone is perfect for those ppl who don't have enough patience when it comes to virtual keyboards and if u like the virtual keyboard this has one 2. It is froyo which is a bit behind but there isn't much of a difference in speed and how the phone works. All in all great for anyone starting smart phones. I love it!!!!!!!!", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unlock phone", "Author": "jean paul Faydit", "ReviewID": "R2NCE2E8O7VU5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung DoubleTime I857 that I purchase from PMG distributor was more that expected.When I check this phone for its specifications it didn't say it got WIFI available, so that was really good.This seller send me a brand new phone, as expected.You need yo use a code to use it as you want, so be aware of it. You'll find it in the box. I did not knew that but after contacting the seller, they answer quickly to my issue, and gave me that code again so I could start use the ing it tight away.Also I arrived in time, as expected too.I recommend both, the phone and the seller!", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "samsung double time I857", "Author": "Angela Folson", "ReviewID": "RUBZ4P7YSV51C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a nice phone and will work sufficiently for my 73 year old mother who is actually enjoying it. However, if you have 4g service with your cell phone provider then this may not be the phone for you. I actually initially bought the phone for myself because I had dropped and cracked my screen on my Galaxy Exhibit so I thought I would find something cheaper, and after searching came across this phone which is nice, but the software is not capatible for the apps that i use so I gave it to my mother. Overall it is a nice phone and great for texting because of the external keyboard which is what I prefer on phones, but it won't store many apps because of the software. A very good and simple phone, but not for high tech use.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "fantastic samsung doubletime unlocked phone", "Author": "Billy J.", "ReviewID": "RY5PZNHS1V12J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone for two reasons the first was to try an android smart phone for the first time at what I felt was affordable and the second was to remove the contract noose from around my neck. The phone is all I had hoped for and more.  I haven't found anything that I don't like about it.  It may be a little slow on the net but I expected that for android 2.2 and an older processor versus a newer model.  Now that I know I like it I will upgrade to something like the SIII in the future.  As for the noose I dropped AT&T; after years as a customer.  I purchased a Straight Talk sim card and an unlimited plan at $45.00 a month and now I use AT&T; towers for a third of the cost.  What a deal.  Love it so much I purchased one for my wife and daughter who both love theirs.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this phone!", "Author": "Kristen Duhaime", "ReviewID": "RA2YJQ9I37O8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love everything about this phone!

It gets very slow less than 30 days after you start to use it.  Even if you add an extra SD card, most of the apps you care about insist on going on the internal memory card, which is WAY too small.  We only got this phone because of the dedicated keyboard that provides nice tactile feedback during texting.
