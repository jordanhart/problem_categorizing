Mine has accumulated metal chips from working in a machine shop, and I think it's on it's last legs (after 4 years of dropping them in mud, on concrete and into water,) but if I took better care of it, it would last me a lot longer. The battery lasts 4-6 days on a full charge, and the recharge only takes 3 hours. It pairs with Motorola S305 wireless Bluetooth Stereo headphones too, so if like to talk hands-free, it works for me. They also play music from your phone - and the music shuts off when a call comes through, and returns to music after you press a button to hang up. I recently got an iPhone, just so that I can get online for college, but I've tried smart phones before, and I may be back to using this phone again in a month or so. It's really reliable in harsh environments! The flashlight comes in handy and I use it at least once or twice a day. It works on the AT&T; 3G or 4G sim card. It has so many features, I'm guessing you'll never use all of them (if you're a real man). I've dropped mine more than a few times - more than 10 feet, and other than a few scratches, it still works great. The rubber back peeled off in the first month, but that's because I took the back off so many times, trying to find a carrier, and using everyone's SIM cards. AT&T; finally won the battle.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Busy Homeowner in PA", "Author": "Elwyn", "ReviewID": "R1ZTG0BB35UM5C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a great phone.  the sound quality is excellent.

In that regard it is stellar.  It has survived a trip through the washing machine (accidental), the occasion rinse under the faucet when it gets dusty, and I can answer the phone in shower (the manual does tell you not to submerge the phone, however).It has basic web browsing, a music player, and a sub-par camera.  I find the built-in LED flash light to be invaluable.  There is a newer version, GT-B2710, that  supports 3G data access but otherwise looks identical.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004I65IVI"}}
