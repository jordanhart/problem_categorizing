{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Its coverage is okay and I wanted to use a Nokia phone", "Author": "Thida Cornes", "ReviewID": "RVAICTV22THQI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's a lot cheaper to use than any postpaid plan if you're a casual cell phone user. I make about 3 calls a week. The coverage is pretty good, but strangely spotty. I can literally walk 40 feet and go from no signal to a good signal in some places.  I mostly got it, because at the time I got it (04/04), it was the only prepaid plan that used a Nokia phone.  I really like the Nokia user interface.The per minute charges are a little confusing, because each card buys a different number of minutes.  Also what each card buys changes as T-Mobile competes with other prepaid plans.  At least as I write this review, $25 buys you 130 minutes and lasts for 3 months, but if you \"top up\" i.e. buy more minutes before the expiration date, all your minutes are renewed for another 3 months.  Last June, T-Mobile had a deal where your minutes lasted for a year.My husband uses Virgin which he's really happy with and at the time I bought, Virgin was little cheaper.  However I find his phone very confusing to use.  And as far as we can tell, the coverage in the SF bay area is about the same between Virgin and T-Mobile.  And now T-Mobile is a little cheaper.  I'm sure the price wars will continue.Since the cost to switch is the phone, and the phone is the biggest investment you'll make, I recommend choosing a prepaid plan based on the phone and the coverage in your area.", "Date": "March 31, 2005"}, {"Title": "T-Mobile To Go-Best prepaid plan out there.", "Author": "Spiehler", "ReviewID": "R1OSERH1110EWS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been with T-Mobile To Go for 2 years or so now. Started carrying one when I started cycling with my daughter. The coverage in the Atlanta area is great, and I've had few problems when traveling. On the rare occasions I've had to visit a T-Mobile store, they've been most helpful, even to the point of directing me to other merchants for cheaper products!Most amazing thing about To Go? Free \"T-Zones.\" This service lets you browse select web sites (CNN, ABC News, ESPN) AT NO CHARGE! As a Red Sox/Patriots fan living in Georgia, it's a great way to keep up with scores, etc.If you are a casual user like me, with the odd two minute call here and again, this is a great service. No daily fees. No roaming. Like the ad says: straight up prepaid.My little secret for affordability? I have an Amazon Visa card that gives me $25 gift certificates as rewards. I use these to buy refill cards. End result-free air time.If you do go w/ To Go, do yourself a favor, and load up $100 worth of minutes immediately. This puts you in the GOLD level, all your minutes are now a flat $0.10 per, and they don't expire for a year. From that point forward, it doesn't matter what denomination card you buy, the rate's the same.I've had such good luck with T Mobile to Go, I got one for my daughter (11 years old). You can find basic To Go starter kits ultra cheap at various big box retailers. If you want a phone with more features, Amazon has them at good prices.FAIR WARNING: If you're a heavy texter/talker, stay away. Texting used to be free (to receive), but now it's $0.10 to send, $0.05 to receive. And obviously, if you talk a lot, you'll burn through minutes like kindling.However, If you're a disciplined occasional user, it's tough to top T Mobile To Go.", "Date": "April 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazon can sell you invalid cards and there is no refund!", "Author": "Robert Kiliman", "ReviewID": "RSLWSV60YEU9F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Be warned.

When I attempted to redeem, I was told it's invalid.  I reported the problems to T-mobile customer representative and supervisor by calling 877-778-2106.  I provided the purchase receipt, order number, amount paid, and all other information requested.  After lengthy conversations with the representatives, they noted that my order is verified and it is in their records.  However, they were unwilling to issue replacement cards or refund.  Reason provided for not crediting the prepaid refill cards was that it was more than 90 days old, and their policy is that the cards expired.

While monthly cellular phone plans start at around $30/month, I average under $10/month with my T-Mobile pre-paid phone. When purchasing minutes $100 at a time, the price is only 10\u00a2 for each minute. You don't get the free nights and weekends like a lot of other plans or the free mobile-to-mobile calling or any of those other gimmicks. The advantage is that you only pay for the service that you use, no more and no less. Anyone who only makes a couple of short calls per day should seriously consider T-Mobile.
