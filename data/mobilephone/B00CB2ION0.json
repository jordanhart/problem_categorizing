Battery life is excellent, button feel is good, screen is easy to read.I am a little disappointed in two ways, in comparison to the Sanyo Taho I had before this phone. Firstly, this phone (or at least the one I received) is not fully waterproof. After using it in the rain, I had some condensation form behind the screen, which took about a week to disappear. Secondly, this phone doesn't feel quite as durable, specifically the flipping hinge. It doesn't feel as solid as Id like. It would also be nice if it had a camera.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sprint Kyocera", "Author": "james simmons", "ReviewID": "R3JQJ3ESK49DAO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We wanted a simple phone without all the smartphone decorations, and what we got was what we asked for.

I mostly use a samsung tablet so did not need to spend $600 on a sprint compatible smart phone. So I got this phone call clarity is great, it was super easy to active on my sprint account and works great. battery life seems excellent but lets face it all I can really do is talk on it. Texting and web stuff is impossible with my large fingers and the small keys.If you need a second phone just to call on and want something that will stand up to abuse this would be a good canidate. The few features it has work simply and as I stated up Battery life and call clarity are good.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exact replacement", "Author": "mechanic", "ReviewID": "R3PNVRQMQSXOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Needed to replace my smart phone to a basic simple phone just for calling.
