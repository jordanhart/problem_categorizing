{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Rip-off", "Author": "DF", "ReviewID": "R2HE2532F4GHRV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The place offering this online had a rip-off offer.  The shipping was jacked way up and when you return it for a refund, you get maybe $4 back total!  Don't bother when they jack up the shipping.  So we learned.The phone has a tiny display and is for Sprint.  No idea how to set it up for ready mobile. It's just really old and cheap looking.I only got this because I was trying to get my friend to try ready mobile service.  I had got their silver sanyo flip phone at CVS in January 2012, which I looooove.  And $20 for 500 minutes including talk/text/web/voicemail, for 30 days, is the best I've seen for any pre-paid phone.  It includes a picture camera, but I found there is no way to transfer the pictures you store in the phone -- usb cord wouldn't help nor bluetooth, and you can't send email data, and no image flash battery thing, etc.  Anyway... The only problem is finding ready mobile phones.  Many CVS stores have not had any ready mobile phones available, and you can't order new ones online.  So, keep an eye out at CVS and get what they've got.  Also look at other pharmacy stores like Walgreens, Rite Aid, etc.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Ready Mobile PCS Prepaid Wireless LG Pho", "Name": "Ready Mobile PCS Prepaid Wireless LG Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31BkSSJ3KML.jpg", "ProductID": "B003VQM0GW"}}
