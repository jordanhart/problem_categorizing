My husband and I keep these as back-ups when we get sick of phones that are too complicated, have bad signal, break easily, can't hold a charge: sound familiar?  Get a nice simple cheap phone like this one and your phone frustrations will be gone! Phone came in short order, excellent like-new condition, unblocked, good battery and a charger to boot. A great deal!!", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Why we are very satisfied with the phone.", "Author": "Dan J.
