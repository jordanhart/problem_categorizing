I have many memories pressing it to my eat with the other ear covered, still barely hearing people.  The touchscreen is nice, until about 16 months into owning it I wasn't able to tap correctly.  If I taped in one spot, it would highlight a different area.  Of course I tried recalibrating it and resetting the phone many times, but it still has a awful sensor.  It's painful to have a full inbox, trying to delete a single message, and taking 10 minutes to respond to a friend.  For me to click \"Unlock >  Messages > Inbox > message > delete > Yes\" takes over 5 minutes and I highly regret buying this phone.  The internet worked well and texting was easy too when the touchscreen worked.

No audio jack for music, so you'll have to resort to buying a specialized earphone set to listen or speakers... And remember, audio quality is bad5.

The phone seems to enjoy receiving and not sharing new text messages I receive, once again simply shutting the phone off and back on will resolve the problem, but seriously, I should get the messages by not having to outsmart the phone. Also a new glitch the phone has developed is that when the battery is running low, the screen will turn on and refuse to go off until the battery dies, not a feature anyone wants in a phone.
