{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The best of Sony Ericsson's Symbian UIQ touch screen phones", "Author": "Ernst Blofeld \"kidgib1\"", "ReviewID": "R2QG1B8H9V1BCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The G900 is a worthy successor to the Sony Ericsson P1i. It fact, its is every bit as good and even better than the Sony Ericsson Walkman Flagship W960i.Though it uses the same Symbian UIQ3 platform as the P1i, the user interface has been polished with the addition of easy to use home screen panels. You can add panels for different applications like messaging, music player, application shortcuts, tasks and calender. These home screen panels make the phone much more user friendly than the P1i and the W960i.The G900 also has a much improved media manager for your pictures, movies, and music files. The media application would be familiar to people who use the PSP and the PS3. It has the feel and looks like the media crossbar that Sony uses in its Playstation line.The G900 also has a 5 mega pixel camera with a picture light. The light can also be used as a bright flash light which can be handy in an emergency situation. The pictures taken by the camera can be a little washed out and lack the vibrant colors of some better 5MP camera phones like the Nokia N95.It has a traditional candy bar form factor. It is much slimmer and smaller than the P1i and the W960i. This makes it a lot more user friendly and more pocketable. Its size combined with its easy to use user interface makes this phone attractive to people who want smart phone capabilities but don't want to deal more complex to use phones. Simply put, this is the best smart phone that Sony Ericsson has made to date...until the Xperia X1 is released at least. :)Pros:-Great touchscreen. The screen is bright and vivid.-Very slim and light for a smart phone with so many features.-Easier to use UIQ3 interface with the addition of panels-Excellent media manager and music player-Five megapixel camera with innovative touch focus-Excellent connectivity with bluetooth and WIFI and GPRSCons:-Does not support EDGE or US 3G networks (Supports UMTS 2100 for European 3G)-Though it takes 5MP pictures, the pictures are not as vibrant as other 5MP camera phones-Lack of built in GPS-Base package does not have any memory stick included-The Opera web browser could be better and does not support flash", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001E38YIM"}}
