Not every function is intuitive, but reception is clear, it holds a charge well, and has every basic plus the camera.  It was recommended by a Radio Shack salesman who had personal experience with it.  Inexpensive, but not cheap quality.  The cover over the charging port feels flimsy, but I have had a phone previously with the same feature and never had a problem.  I have had more expensive flip phones that were not as reliable.  There are limited choices at the carrier's store.  After six weeks, good so far.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "AT&T; Z222 Go Phone", "Author": "Sandra Gallegos", "ReviewID": "R12TSM7BP5O5K1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my new go phone. It is full of extras like an alarn, voice recorder, address/phone number book, speaker phone and more. The sound quality is great, it sounds better than some peoples smart phones and the price was really reasonable for all that you get in this phone. I am very satisfied with this purchase.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone with camera", "Author": "Lonii", "ReviewID": "R26PP1IU7IN9NE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My senior aged dad needed an easy phone to operate. He does not text but wanted a camera on his phone. This model also has a microphone feature so he is able to hear his calls while walking  and talking outside. Its a great, slim, flip open style phone for anyone needing an inexpensive way to stay in touch.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent phone, inexpensive, no tech support", "Author": "Raymond Pipkin", "ReviewID": "RR645LZ48C2O3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The ZTE Model Z222 cellphone is about as basic a cellphone one could buy. It sends and receives calls and text messages (it has a non-qwerty keyboard), its audio is fine, it has a contact list with eight speed-dials, and it has a calendar wherein alarms can be set. It is a 3G generation phone. It has limited blue-tooth capability (more about that below).  Its camera is marginal.Its major positive feature is its low initial price and its low operating cost. Its purchase price was $40. When used as an AT&T; GoPhone, prepay cards for 250 minutes or 90 days are available for $25 (10\u00a2/minute). Because I normally only use the phone for about 3 minutes a day to call home, that works out to about 4 cards or $100 per year for me. You can't get much cheaper than that.Bluetooth connectivity was a disappointment. It is easy enough to upload and download pictures to and from a computer. However, plain text uploads from the computer go into a folder on the cellphone called \"Other Files.\" These plain text files can be read on the cellphone, but they can't be edited, or moved to the \"Drafts\" folder from which they could be sent as text messages.It would be convenient if one could compose text messages on a computer with a simple text editor, and upload them to the cellphone to be sent as text messages. I tried calling AT&T; Tech Help, but alas, the call was routed to the Philippines where the call was answered by a nice lady with a sing-song voice who attempted to read out solutions from an online FAQ file,I next sent an email to ZTE technical support (presumably in China, because it took several days to receive a response). The ZTE tech support email reads as follows:-----------Dear Valued ZTE Customer:Thank you for contacting us.Really sorry for the late reply.To deal with your issue, it would be beneficial if some details are available:(1) Your device model (like MF626).(2) Its IMEI/ESN/MSN number.(3) The place where device was purchased.(4) The date when device was purchased.(5) Your service provider.(6) Your location (city/country).(7) Your contact number.(8) What is the specific problem when used?(9) What is the specific description of your requirements?(10)What is the problem when the device is used?(11)What is the brand of your computer?(12)What is its exact operating system?We would also appreciate an attached screenshot showing the problem occurring.We will reply as soon as all of the above details are available.Should there be any further assistance required, please do not hesitate to contact us.Best Regards,------------No, I don't think I will be contacting them again. My original email was very specific and included most of the items they requested, and ALL of the pertinent details that they needed.China is a totalitarian society, and the above email response from ZTE is probably indicative of how potential problem makers are treated in China. I imagine that if I were to question a traffic ticket in China, I would be requested to fill out a 48 page questionnaire and state the part number of my left front door and the amount of tread left on the spare tire in my trunk.So if you buy the ZTE Z222, don't expect any technical help from AT&T; or ZTE. You will be on your own.One star because the Z222 is affordable, and one star because it does what it is supposed to do. Minus three stars for being blown-off when requesting technical assistance.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is the Third One of These I've Purchased", "Author": "Chet Hale", "ReviewID": "RZ52C1SZA9MRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have now purchased three of these phones in the past 8 months. They work great for the price. My only problem is that I am buying them for my elderly mother and she can't remember to take the phone out of her pants pocket when she throws her pants in the laundry. Needless to say, when she finds it after it goes through the washing machine (the first time) and the Dryer after washing (the second time) it doesn't power up. Who would of thought that cell phones were not wash and wear?", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "No Battery but I did not need one", "Author": "James Butts", "ReviewID": "R2PED6H5EHQRFG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So far so good. $25 is a reasonable price for a cell phone without a contract.

Nothing flows smoothly. It tells you that you have 1 or more message & 1 or more missed calls at one time. However, if you select, 1 of these items, it doesn't tell you that there are other things that you have missed. You can't move a calendar entry from 1 date to another. Managing the contacts was so difficult that I actually some entries. I can go on & on about all the problems I have encountered with this piece of JUNK that I bought. I bought it to replace my Nokia 6350, which had fallen on the floor, a few times to many & was starting to have cracks. I wish I could be able to use it. There is 1 positive thing that I can say. The vibration is much better than I had with the Nokia 6350, which does help.
