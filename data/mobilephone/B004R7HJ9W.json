I have had 4 Kyocera phones from Virgin mobile and have never been disappointed by what Kyocera as a phone maker has to offer and remember each of these phones fondly my most recent Kyocera phone through Virgin Mobile being this one and though I am about to tuck it away in a drawer for safe keeping so I can update to an Android phone through the Virgin provider  I felt I owed it to this phone to give it a review this truely is a great phone for what I needed it for.Pro's and Con's Of The Kyocera Loft By Virgin MobileI'll start with the Pro's- This is a very reliable phone as a phone it has decent battery life and though I had read that it drops calls a lot for some this has not been my experience with this phone it has been very dependable for calls dependable enough that I no longer have a home phone and this has been the main way of contacting me.- It is great for text and picture messaging and has and I am still awed with how many pictures & messages I can save  and keep on this phone with little noticeable lag on other functions.- The camera is not the best but is decent for the price and a steady hand goes a long way with how the camera preforms for youOver all the basic functions as a phone make this phone money well spent it is VERY good on basic functions and well beyond acceptable for the price. I got this phone once from amazon had it stolen and replaced it through virgin mobile and was pleased with both units i got though I did have to pay for it both times Virgin did pay the shipping and handling for the replacement phone and it was to me within days of my order from Virgin's web site... my amazon order did take a little longer but it was also standard shipping so can't complain.- Feels good in hand and has a rubberize finish that feels like rubber silk and is very resistant to wear and tare which very nice to me.- Decent screen- Durable it can take a beating in a dark ally at night in new york.Con's of the Kyocera Loft from Virgin Moble- I was not impressed with connect at all... it's not as great as some of the reviews made it out to be and it is slightly easyer to install opera mini and take care of your social networking and e-mail through there.- The internet can be slow on this phone though pages do load in time if your looking for a phone with Bing-Bang-Zip faster then the speed of light your there... this may not be the phone for you. though the Opera brower is a MUST as the internet browser pre-installed on the phone is VERY VERY slow.- No, you can not listen to music on this phone- No, you can not watch or take video with this phone- No self picture mirror or flash on this phone.Over all I have enjoyed this phone if you can deal with the limitations of this phone you will too.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone/tiny keypad", "Author": "Louise Judson \"Cherubino\"", "ReviewID": "R90VFIB65GAOR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the phone for the most part. The drawback for me, as an older person, is the keypad is very tiny and you have to get accustomed to using your fingernail to do the dialing. The number one dials is large and very clear on the screen, however, eliminating calling wrong numbers. Texting is convenient on this phone because there is a key for each letter and punctuation that I did not have on my old phone. If the keypad is not a problem for you I would recommend it. Pricewise, it is a good value.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Final thoughts on the Kyocera Loft", "Author": "JG2007", "ReviewID": "R2TQ6KTX9EJE14", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a year and a half, and now that I am upgrading, I thought I would write a review based on my experiences with it.PROS:The phone itself is small and sturdy.  It is easy to navigate the menus.  The speakerphone is very solid and loud, one of the best I have ever used.CONS:The keyboard is very small and cramped.  It can be tricky to figure out how to dial phone numbers that contain letters. The reception on this phone is not as good as one would expect.  The camera is a little lacking.  The web browser is functional, but if you are looking for something to play videos or stream music, look else-ware.  This phone has very few apps, although the ones it does have (instant messenger, mapping software, ect) are functional.Overall this is a fairly good phone, and the price it is currently fairly reflects its value.  When I purchased the phone it was $100.As far as the Virgin Mobile service, I found it to be a fair value for what you pay.  Be prepared however, if you have an issue with the service it can be nearly impossible to get someone live on the phone to help you, and it can take a long time to resolve problems.  My phone wouldn't send text messages for some reason (I am on a monthly plan that includes unlimited texting) and it took over a week to resolve.  They did credit me some free talk minutes, but it didn't really compensate for the hassle of having to call them every day and wait for 20 to 30 minutes to speak to someone.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid phone to upgrade to", "Author": "Kellie \"No Bias Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "RVOVOZ6FSSPK4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I feel this phone is a good upgrade phone for anyone coming from a basic phone.  The item was new as described and easy to activate. Been having for about 3 wks now and am pleased with it. The $35 price with free shipping was the cheapest anywhere at the time I had found the phone on amazon.Its not heavy, a nice size.  The calls are clear and the speaker phone is as well. Texting is much easier for me now and I would say that's the main purpose of this phone.Like others have noted you can access internet but can't download any videos or music as the streaming feature isn't available for this phone. I knew that already after doing some research b/f choosing the phone so its not a big deal.  When it does become a big deal though, amazon will be one of the first places I'll look for my next virgin mobile phone!", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Upgraded \"Free\" Phone from Assurance Wireless", "Author": "Aurora Night", "ReviewID": "R3RHUOW816P4Y8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recieved a free phone from Assurance Wireless...that in my opinion was substandard...be advised that I am a former cell phone sales associate that was with Circuit City for years...top sales in my region. I purchased this one that was more text friendly to use with my added 200 text pack. It is similar in size to my Samsung Freeform that I had with Metro PCS ....the keys on the keyboard are slightly raised and the wasted space between keys on this phone is better put to use for larger/longer more finger friendly keys. The battery life is so much better than the free phone I was sent. Virgin Mobile/Assurance wanted 60 some odd dollars for this phone...too much thanks Amazon for putting a better phone in my financial reach to use with my \"lifeline\"...assurance did help with the serial numer transfer...be aware that they \"assurance\" may charge $10 to do the transfer...but I have to thank them for waveing that in my case.

Lingle", "ReviewID": "R3PUQVIR9FQD1O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I first got this phone in June of 2010. I was tired of paying a ton for a contract. It did take me awhile to get used to the keyboard, but I have small hands so it worked for me. There were small issues after I had had it for awhile.FOR EXAMPLE:After awhile, If I got a missed call, it would show I had a missed call but would not show who it was that called me.You always have to select text instead of photo, that gets annoying but eventually you get used to that too.It is not a super fast phone, and it lags a little when you start a text message.I liked that I didn't have to worry about damaging the phone. It was so cheap, that if I needed to replace it it would be no big deal. I thought I would upgrade to another VM phone, but realized that I liked this one much better. I returned the new phone and went back to this one. I think this phone is great, and for what they charge, amazing! Be aware, this phone USED to be on their prepaid plans, but now is only offered under Paylo. I use Paylo, and they have a really good plan with 30mb of data. You don't need much data at all if you only check facebook/email. I have never even come close to using up all the data and I check my facebook several times a day on it.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "great, not perfect", "Author": "Shawn C.

Biggerstaff \"stuart_b\"", "ReviewID": "RRZOWSWR1ZD8B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In the end I couldn't use it, but a nice phone.  When I tried one of these (a Kyocera Loft, on Virgin's Beyond Talk, but the same phone) it came in handy when I used it where I couldn't get Cricket coverage.  And (only) because it let me install Opera Mini, I was able to access my work e-mail and bank website--which I couldn't do with Cricket's low-end text phones at all.  But this one wouldn't let me use my own ringtone.The good:Voice was very good, Calls clear, and easy to use speakerphone feature.Good camera.  Pictures were clearer and more usable than on some 2MP phone cameras.Operating system provides for Java app support.  Opera Mini and Google Maps already installed--good because Opera provides access to web resources most phone web browsers don't, and Google Maps lets you use the GPS without paying to use Virgin Mobile's one.So many other phones like this make it hard not to accidentally open the web browser, but not this one.The bad:Keypad is good size, but the two-level keys limit the size of the text on the keys and seems a poor third choice to the usual domed keys or slightly separated ones.Sprint coverage has not been as good as the other major carriers--or even Cricket--where I live.Sprint locks the phone so it only allows use of the included ringtones or those purchased from Virgin Mobile.  I suppose this is a bit picky, but the available ones seem to be mostly music and a few sound effects.  I use a couple of very specific tones for voice and text, and it didn't look like there were any appropriate substitutes.Though the camera is quite good, the viewer isn't.  The best way to appreciate how good the pictures are is to set one as a background or send it to another phone or a computer.  You can't view images fullscreen.I never found a really good idle screen option.  For both the Cricket phones I had used and the LG phones I've used, it was easy to use a monthly calendar as the clock display, but nothing like that on this one.This is a really nice phone, if you can live with the limitations.  It would still make a nice entry-level phone for Beyond Talk, but Virgin Mobile doesn't advertize it as such.And yes.  Looking on Virgin Mobile's site it looks like this phone is one of the few that CAN run on either Beyond Talk or PayLo, so add program flexibility to its advantages.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Victoria Suesz", "ReviewID": "R3SVFJ8EMTKXT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been with Virgin for close to 10 years now and this is my 4th phone with them.  I usually keep a phone until it dies.  When I bought this one it was almost $100 but still cheaper than the blackberries were.  At first it had to be used with a data plan but now I use it with the prepaid minute plan as I don't do much talking.  In the three years I have had it I have been very happy.  It does everything it is supposed to do.  It does not play music or stream video, but it is not programed for that.  The keys are a little small but I soon got used to them.

Anyway, I'd just try this as it does help with picture messages.Next the ringtone. Two separate issues. The ringtone is somewhat static sounding when it rings. I downloaded some ringtones and they all sounded this way. Also, I cannot get the ringtone to ring for more then 5 seconds (for some reason) for text messages. I contacted support and I didn't get any solutions. Also, there are NO smileys..which stinks.I do like this phone. I just wish the ringtone was alittle clearer.

I pretty much use my cellphone to text and make the occasional call. My previous phone didn't have a QWERTY keyboard so I decided to (finally) upgrade to make texting easier. Imagine my surprise and disappointment in realizing that the keys on the keyboard were so tiny and closely spaced together that I had an easier time texting with my old phone.I did not use any of the other functions, so I can't comment on them. I'm disappointed: it's an attractive phone, feels good in my hand and generally seems like a solid Virgin Mobile PayLo phone.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Did not work", "Author": "KeeKee", "ReviewID": "R3B1SLTR3EA8E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT ORDERED THIS!
