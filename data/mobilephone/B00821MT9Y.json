It is super fast, easy to use and best of all it supports flash.  It also has an amazing 8 mp rear camera with flash and a forward facing camera for video chat and easy self portraits!  After owning this phone I have absolutely no desire for an IPhone or any other overpriced phone.  I get great service, this is a premium phone and it is a great price for $199 LOVE IT!!!  Oh yeah, and the voice searching features are 100% EVERY TIME!", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty fantastic phone, BUT there is one issue...", "Author": "Joshua L. Coleman", "ReviewID": "R2HYH6VZQJLHW8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "...this phone is fantastic.  It's fast; faster than, or at least equal to, an iPhone.  I'm not an Apple fanboi, so I wanted a smartphone that ran Android and had decent speed.  I also didn't want to pay $130 to a 'contract' based service, for one month of phone service.  That was just outrageous.  SO, I went with this phone, the Huawei Mercury M886.  (I often joke with friends that the name of the company that makes it, Huawei, is pronounced to sound like \"Who are we??\"...a little tongue-in-cheek. I know it's not actually pronounced like that, but it's still amusing.)  They also make Cricket's other popular phones, the Ascend and Ascend II.  The Mercury though, seems to be their premiere and fastest smartphone, and as I've stated, it works great, except for one thing.Now for the issue:  The battery life is really not anywhere near what it states.  If you were consistently talking, I would estimate you'd get about 4 hours of actual talk time.  And that would be starting with a 100% charge.  And 380 hours of standby time?  NO WAY.  That's 15...almost 16 days.  I'd give it a maximum of TWO days....and that's with nothing enabled!  With things like 3G or WiFi and GPS on, you need to charge it every day.  Now, admittedly, I have the battery the phone came with.  There is an extended battery available, and in the past, I have almost always bought the extended battery.  The only problem?  Nothing fits when you have an extended battery, because the bigger battery requires a new door and a new case.  So any accessories that are available for the phone no longer fit, because nothing is designed with the extended battery in mind.  However, if you can get over that, I would so go ahead and grab the extended battery...it'll about double your time between charges.  Otherwise, carry a micro-usb cable with you, because this phone will need it.  You can hook it up to a computer USB port, or its own charger power cord.  A car charger is a good option if you spend lots of time in your car, just make sure to get a Huawei official charger, as it tends to not charge with third party chargers.  It's quite power hungry, but aside from that, it's truly a great phone.  I give it four stars out of five.  For the fifth star, they'd have to rework the battery system.  A 1950 MaH battery is just not enough.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "$800 smartphone for under $200!", "Author": "Dr. M. A. Dixon \"hyper-observant\"", "ReviewID": "R15F1WR8P56UML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beautiful fast android smartphone that ATT, Verizon, TMobile, etc would charge you $800 for unless you sign up for a 2-year contract and then they would give you the $199 price. Cricket is month-to-month with no contract and charges less than these other carriers per month as well as not charging you an extra $600 for buying a phone without the contract! Way to go Cricket! This is such a beautiful fast powerful phone too!; way to go Huawei!", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid Android Phone!", "Author": "Perry Y. Bush \"MrMercury\"", "ReviewID": "R2XKCD5MDX54BT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The title says it all!Very good batt life (for a smartphone ... compares with iphone 4s, which I have owned), external speaker, display, camera, very fast processor 1.4 gz single core, ... etc.Only prob ... must turn off wi-fi to send mms ... that means if you want send a pict via texting app turn off wi-fi. MMS used to work properly until Cricket broke it with an update. NOTE: this does not affect sms (regular texting).Also, if you need use the GPS, wi-fi must be off (this is the default behavior). The GPS on this phone works extremely well with the google maps and google navigation apps. It connects almost instantly everytime I use it.I am very please with the phone ... it is the best smartphone for the money, period!If you are an Andriod fan, you won't be disappointed!BTW ... This phone out the box does not play all video formats. To remedy this go to the google play app store and get \"MX Player\". It's free and plays anything I throw at it flawlessly.One other thing ... the memory is built in, 2GB. If you don't have alot of picts & music this will be fine. Otherwise, you can get a 8GB Micro SD card for less than 10 bucks online here at amazon. Look at the phone manual how to remove the back cover and insert it. Now you will have two different storage areas on the phone, but your picts & music will still show even if you have some stored on one, and some stored on the other.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone and excellent value", "Author": "Like Lincoln", "ReviewID": "R23RPFRIK8GKA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is truly a great phone and with Cricket's 'no contract' I have the freedom that I want.  It is exceptionally fast. The screen quality is sharp and clear.  The sound is great - love to listen to Pandora on it.

Thompson", "ReviewID": "ROWPLBXZN2BM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I know one of the other reviewers already said this, but this really is an $800 phone for under $200. Just compare the specs to phones made by Samsung, HTC, and Motorola that sell for 3 to 4 times as much retail! It makes me wonder how high the profit margin is with these other companies. Take the HTC One V for example, has a much slower processor and less battery life than the Mercury, and those are selling for $300 here on Amazon. Btw I'm not sure why Amazon specs saying this phone has HD video camera. It has a sweet camera and very high quality video, but I don't see an option for HD anywhere in the settings on my Mercury. This is the best smartphone I have owned to date.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "well pleased", "Author": "daniel rayside", "ReviewID": "RCTC4D6NBP5WF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Grate phone execp for the porno vedio left on it.

The battery lasted quite some time as I h sad it for a week before handing it over to the end owner.  I did run it through the mill of torture and the phone responded better than expected.
