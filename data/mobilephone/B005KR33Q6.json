I am old school so I only needed a phone with a camera, voice mail, and occasional texting.  This phone is exactly what I had before and I am happy with the vendor. The phone came with a 110 volt charger for about $50. I have purchased a replacement OEM battery for about $6.00 at Amazon. This flip-phone has a calendar, calculator, alarms (3), and you can download music. The main display is much larger than the outside display. There is a Micro-SD slot for storing photos and music.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "it's only a phone", "Author": "L.

No excuses or runarounds, just a promise to send a new phone, with a prepaid envelope to return the defective phone.I purchased this phone for my wife because she had significant difficulty with her Samsung Brightside, which required 4 replacements & still did not work correctly. She did not purchase the Brightside from this seller. Her \"Chocolate\" was her favorite phone & gave her zero problems, it just died. LG no longer makes this basic phone available for people who do not want to use smartphones or just do not have the technical capability of mastering apps, touch screens & other functions.It is great to know that someone has enough of these phones available for people like my wife.

I contacted the seller. Logically, if the settings are locked, the phone is not new and is used. The seller agreed to send me another phone, but a used one, for the same price of the 'new' one. He wanted me to pay for the used one, first, again. That was not proper customer service. He made an error, he was not honest about the phone status, and he should have simply sent the darn used phone and waited for me to mail the supposed 'new' phone back---not to mention I was paying for my own shipping to return the broken 'new' phone he sent.Amazon assisted me with obtaining a refund. He was just horrible and not honest.I had all my emails as proof, AND he sends a flyer in his packages asking you to call him via telephone first if there is a problem with the order and to please avoid contacting Amazon, first.

Big mistake. LG has tried to make what used to be a simple phone do everything a smart phone does. Consequently, for example, to check Missed Calls, one must wade through 5 menus to get there. You have to wade through menu after menu to do just about anything, and since it's not a smart phone, that means pressing tiny buttons that are easily done wrong.I use an iPhone, and it's far easier to use than this phone is, because they're trying to make an old hog do what a new smart phone does, and the implementation is terrible.Not only that, but the face covering the front of the phone, the part that covers the camera, etc. fell off less than a month after we bought it.
