{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Consumer Cellular Doro 410 Large Text Flip Cell Phone for ELDERLY(USA)", "Author": "MOO \"ZIC\"", "ReviewID": "RP2G1W0EYQXGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First things first:Cons: If you are getting this phone for features like a camera or the texting capability,then don't bother. There is no camera and the texting is very basic and slow. Caller ID is not displayed on the outside of the clamshell / flip phone design. The phone is preset to answer when opened, so it basically defeats your need for caller ID.(This can be changed to the answer mode \"any key\" setting; however. You can view the caller ID after you open the phone.)The Situation: This phone was purchased for my 84 year old (ELDERLY) mother. She has never used a cell phone in her life and lives at an assisted living facility.She wears 2 hearing aids and has failing eyesight.Pros: The Doro 410 has extra loud and clear sound (+35 dB) and a vibrating ringer. Mom likes the choice of the \"old school\" ringer sound. This phone is amazingly simple once set up properly.(She could not have done this herself.) It was easily customizable. I adjusted the display background(wallpaper) to be the easiest for her to see the screen clearly. I hid(Blocked) the games, alarm, calendar, calculator, FM Radio and texting options from the main menu. I also deactivated the call waiting option. Mom loves the Open to answer - Close to hang up setting and doesn't care about the caller ID. The included lanyard makes it easy for her to carry around her neck when she goes out.(And she doesn't lose the phone. : ) You can program the Emergency Call Key on the outside of the phone to text a relative in an emergency. The phone will then call the relative and immediately turn on the speakerphone for mom.(Another good reason for the lanyard.)Essential Accessories: The charging cradle is ideal for mom.(Ordered it online at ConsumerCellular. Possibly call ConsumerCellular and order as a gift if you use the phone unlocked for a different carrier.) The phone has contacts on the bottom. She just drops the phone in the cradle for charging.(Even with the lanyard attached.)Service Carriers: This phone comes locked to the ConsumerCellular network. They are a company that has an agreement with AT & T. So, you are really getting the AT & T network towers. Ask around to make sure AT & T network is strong in your area or this network will not work for you. ConsumerCellular representatives are courteous and helpful.(I believe they are right here in USA. Easy to understand.) Their pricing of plans seem fair.A Possible Option: This is a GSM phone.(Technology used by AT & T, Cingular and TMobile.) Most carriers around the globe use this also.(Verizon and Sprint use CDMA, so the 410 will not work with these guys.) Unlocked cell phones seem to be the trend these days. It is possible to get an unlock code for your Doro 410. I went to cellunlocker dot net and selected Doro. Then, I selected model: 410 and Network: All Other International Carriers and got the IMEI from mom's Doro. Received the unlock code in e-mail for about 10 bucks. My ConsumerCellular SIM was already active. I replaced it with a SIM Card from T-Mobile Prepaid activation kit. Turned on the phone and input the unlock code when the screen for Operator code: Trials: 5 came up. The OK button appeared to the left of the SOS button after I put in the unlock code numbers, so I then pressed OK. The searching icon showed briefly, then T-Mobile appeared where it used to just say My Network. The Doro 410 is now unlocked to all GSM carriers. T-Mobile just happens to have the best reception in the area where mom is. She has a great monthly rate and no contract. You could probably just buy a SIM activation kit for AT & T as well. Hope this helps somebody out there!SPECIAL NOTE:(According to comment by Smilin Sam,[see below]you do not need to have the phone and SIM activated by ConsumerCellular in order to unlock the phone.)I think a distinction between the terms \"SENIOR\" and \"ELDERLY\" should be drawn. I would call the Doro 410gsm the perfect \"ELDERLY\" phone. Some seniors may like it as well though. : )Review by an average guy with an elderly mom", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is NOT an unlocked phone", "Author": "Dennis A. Staysniak", "ReviewID": "R3ICV9LKI0TJD8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While this is a great phone for seniors who want a very basic easy to read and use phone.  This is not an UNLOCKED phone as is intimated by the sales info.  This phone is locked to Consumer Cellular and they will not unlock it or offer you a pay-as-you-go plan.", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Basic Phone", "Author": "J. DeStefano", "ReviewID": "R26CJUF5REM8YU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone has an excellent display, clear sound and very easy to use.  However, it may be a bit too basic for some people.  For example, the phone listings don't provide the ability to enter addresses, emails or other contact information for an individual.  There is only one alarm setting versus the multiple setting available for each day on my last cell phone.  The day timer function doesn't provide the ability to set alarms so that you are aware of an event BEFORE it occurs. The ringer loudness isn't as loud as that I've experienced on a number of other cell phones, and I've actually missed calls when in a noisey environment.On the other hand, the lite buttons at night are very helpful.  The large buttons should likewise be appreciated by users with large hands, gloves or long nails.  The LEDs on the outside of the case which let you know when you have a message and when the battery is low is very useful.Overall, a good, solidly built phone for someone who basically just wants to talk on their cell phone.UPDATE 2/13 - For the past few months both my wife and I who have this same phone have been having problems with the charger connection not engaging or cutting off before the charge is complete.  I've also noticed the calender function is no longer working properly and the display colors sometimes wash out then return later on. I still have a much older Motorola basic phone I use as a timer and note keeper which still operates perfectly.For the above reliability reasons, I no longer recommend this Doro phone.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Finally!... a mobile phone my mom will use!", "Author": "cherylynn3", "ReviewID": "R17GD2A3I6RRSR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"Moo's\" review is spot on, and here's our experience...Mom found success with her Doro - a 3rd attempt at owning/using a cellphone - for three reasons:1. \"Open to talk, close to hang up\"2. Simplified phone book directory that's a breeze to access in the menu3. Red is her favorite colorThe phone is not unlocked, but I found a free unlock code online.  For phones manufactured before January 26, 2013, this is allowable.  If you do code-break your phone for use with your current carrier, the IMEI number on the device itself cannot be used because it's alpha-numerical ...enter *#06# on the phone to display the numerical IMEI.I recommend someone with a bit of phone savvy set up the phone before giving to an elderly person for use.  Like other reviewers, I hid the menus for Games, etc.  In the Directory, default order is alphabetical.  But, I was able to prioritize my mom's list by entering a space or number before the names I wanted to appear first.  Example: Able, Baker, Charlie could be listed as 1 Baker, 2 Able, 3 Charlie ...or if you simply key a \"space\" before a name it will appear at the top of an alphabetized listing.  This took a little effort, but now Mom's phone displays her children's names in the order she should call during an emergency.The Doro has a \"hot\" button on the outside of the device.  I programmed it with Mom's first priority contact, explaining \"if you fall and it affects your vision or speech, just press this one button until you hear beeps and then let go...I will be on speakerphone and can talk with you or know you are too injured to speak but need help.\"  I didn't set this alarm button to 911, because Mom and I couldn't test it without dialing them.  :-(Voice Mail setup required assistance from AT&T; customer care...easy to do, but they had to activate the mailbox for the number they provided before I could establish VM settings and a recording.After one month, Mom will answer her phone and dial out.  She likes the lanyard because she can find the phone by its \"string\" in her messy purse.  I think she'll agreeably wear the phone on its lanyard when working outside, etc.  I'm glad the phone has a long battery life; otherwise, she would leave it on the wall charger and not have it in her purse at all times, because she values \"100% ready\".Mom still balks at using the Call Log to check missed calls and view/delete history.  She also balks at Messages, but will sometimes read them if she hears the incoming text signal.  I'd like to teach her to send a \"K\" response text to confirm receipt/safety of a text, but that's a Phase 2 for Mom.To reiterate, the Doro 410 does not have a camera and does not receive photo texts.  Online research indicates Consumer Cellular does offer a Doro phone that does this...but I never found where to buy one 3rd-party, and we don't need it.Overall, Doro is a huge success for us, simply because Mom will use this phone!", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect for what it is designed for.", "Author": "D. Culp \"diarci\"", "ReviewID": "R24CUA3ODEUWCP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The joy of this phone is it's simplicity and ease of use. Press the Red Button and wait about 7 seconds - not bad compared with some SIM card phones I've used - and you get a display with the name of your service provider, the time and date. Hold the button again for about 7 seconds to turn the power off.On the bottom of the display (and the display uses nice, large, fonts) are Menu on the left and Name on the right. Press the lighted bar under Name and you go straight to the phonebook. Press the lighted bar under Menu and you go to (oh, this is too easy) the Menu. Press the lighted arrow keys and scroll through Phonebook, Messages, Call, LogAlarm, Calendar, Calculator, FM Radio, Games, and of course, Settings.I don't know what problem the one negative reviewer might have had, but I had no trouble at all setting my Doro to display the day/month/and year as well as the time.The Phonebook is not complicated, but as this phone is intended for older users, the instructions might have been a bit more complete. When entering a name, in order to place a blank space between the first and last name, you need to press th zero (0) key. This isn't mentioned in the manual but there is a small marker below the 0 that helped me figure it out. The pound key (#) also has a small marker and (this is mentioned in the manual) that is what you press to access the Special Characters. After that, everything is remarkably easy. When you select Add or New Contact, a menu offers pre-defined spaces for Name, Mobile, Home, and Office. Pressing the lighted bar on the left Saves your entry. Pressing the lighted bar on the right takes you Back to the previous Icon. You want more? Okay, it has Bluetooth connectivity. You can copy your phonebook entries to or from the SIM card to or from the phone memory. You can enable Silent ModeIf you service offers messaging (I use a T-Mobile pre-paid card that does not) just scroll to Messages. There is Voice Mail, Speed Dialing (9 numbers), and from Setup you can activate an SOS button on the back of the phone. Press it quickly twice or hold it for three seconds, and it will dial (and send a pre-determined text message) to whatever number you have selected. No, it won't call 911, automatic calls to 911 are prohibited. The phone has a bright, clear display, very good volume and better than average battery lifeWhat else? On the outside of the phone are two small lights. One flashes if you have a missed call or message, the other flashes if your battery is getting low. There is also a battery level indicator on the main display and there are Soft Keys that can be assigned multiple functions.And the Doro 410 does not have a camera. It isn't designed for tech-savvy people. It's designed for someone who needs a basic phone for sending and receiving calls. Your teenager will not like it. Your parents will. The phone comes with a SIM card from Consumer Cellular who is the sole service provider, but a quick Google will turn up lots of unlocking codes. In fact, e-Bay has listings for (new) unlocked Doro 410's at $59.00! Just pop in your curent SIM card and go.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Doro 410", "Author": "william C Hayes", "ReviewID": "R2CJ0WHCSTS8G8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am 81 and do not know how to run much but this phone I am able to work good", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone!", "Author": "Barbara", "ReviewID": "RPLYFHGMSO5F9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased for my senior mom and it is perfect!
