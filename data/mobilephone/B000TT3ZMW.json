Round buttons are easier to use than old square ones, camera (with excellent flash) takes detailed photos, and I find the software much easier to use than Nokia, Siemens or Motorola. k810 is also thinner than earlier k series, camera cover less lumpy, and phone feels very solid. Screen is very bright and sharp, and scratch resistant. I have a 1 GB card in it, so I never worry about filling it up with photos, mp3s, etc., phone connects to windows, mac and linux via (supplied) USB cable. Battery goes almost a week on a charge with steady use.", "Date": "September 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera with a phone!", "Author": "Jose Carlos Paredes", "ReviewID": "R1BHCXIIOHFHJX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a great phone, as it supports java you can add tons of apps, the built-in memory is small but you can add a 4GB card, yes, 4GB even though the manual says it only supports 2GB i'm using a 4GB Sandisk M2 and it works fine. The camera is pretty good, one of the best on a cell phone but still no match for a real digital camera.The only thing I don't like is that you can't have 3G on AT&T; with this phone, it just doesn't have the right frequency, you only get voice and messaging.", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Phone", "Author": "A.
