For a touch screen, it works pretty well. I like all the features and they are easy to use. The screen does play scroll crazy once in a while but I think that is typical for a touch screen. Battery life is pretty good, I plug it in every 2-3 days. I've had better but I've also had worse. I've dropped the phone a few times and it still works great, but it seems that it is designed to have the back pop off and the battery fall out if you even drop it from a couple inches above a surface. Sound has never been an issue, on speaker phone or otherwise. Not too many ringtones/alarms available but who really cares about that anyway? I'm not in love with this phone but I really don't have any complaints either.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "very nice phone for price", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R2OTSY3ZW86UNA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I decide to buy this phone, I have read all the reviews. But I bought it because of the price. I just wanted to use it for calling and texting, and did not want to pay much for just phone and become slavery to contract.Mine is unlocked phone, and have no problem to use with T-Mobile. I have used it for 3 days so far. I have not experienced any problem that other guys mentioned on the reviews. Phone is enough small and light to put it in small pocket. Functions are simple and convenient to manipulate. Touch screen and calling quality is enough good. If you have a touch screen accuracy problem for texting, just recalibrate it. There is a recalibrate function on the device.A couple of thing that I don't like is: 1) Camera does not provide enough good quality images. 2) It is not easy to control scrolling on touch screen. (I am not sure this is a device problem or mine). Except for these two problems, everything is ok. If you guys like to use internet on phone, you need to buy bigger and more expensive ones.

I will send a text at 7:50 PM and someone will respond but their text will say it was sent at 4:12 AM). The message icon will stay on the screen even if I don't have any messages.

This is not a smart phone, but a feature phone.  Since I don't use a cell for data, I wanted a feature phone, thereby saving $20 per month charge for data from my carrier.  I owned an lg vue previously and was reasonably happy with it, but it's outdated at this point, so decided to try another lg.  This is an AT&T; \"Go Phone\"  though, you don't have to use it as such.  The touch screen is not comparable to something like an iphone, but you get what you pay for, so no complaints there since I went into it knowing that.  It is slow to process at times, which I can also deal with.  My biggest complaint is the texting glitch it has.  I'm still not sure what sets this off, but it seems if you get a text message's one right after the other, it causes it to see the messages as \"still running\"  This causes the phone to give you an error message, when you attempt to reply, which says,\"text message still running\". So far, the only way to get out of this loop is to turn the phone on and off.  I have tried to go into all folders and delete all stored messages to see if it would allow me to reply by text.  I thought the issue was connected to having a message in my draft folder, but not so.  I emailed LG support and all they could offer is suggestion to do a soft reset, in other words, turn phone off, open cover, remove battery, replace, and start again.  That's pretty lame.  There is no update to OS either.  I bought this on eBay from a reseller, who has indicated they are willing to exchange if I want.  So, I may not be stuck with it.  If you don't text much, you may find this adequate.  I send probably 200-300 texts per month on average.  That is probably on the low end compared to most cell users.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "excelente", "Author": "haydn", "ReviewID": "RAGYO59SLHYZ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "el producto llego en el tiempo estipulado, en excelentes condiciones, recomendado totalmente este proveedor, muy responsable y el producto funciona al 100%", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "i like", "Author": "jose osorio", "ReviewID": "R1H1ATGCN9I1CR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "lg brand i like very good cell phone complies whit thechnical specificationsCumple con lo descrito en el catalogo de funciones", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXCELENT.

The biggest bonus to this phone is that it doesn't require a data plan and I could put all of my grandmother's speed dial numbers right on the third home screen so all she has to do is tap the picture of my mom and hit call to call her, which she loves!

Their response, quoted directly from the e-mail, is \"We facilitate the warranty for the first 90 days. After the first 3 months, we suggest you to contact LG to take advantage of any factory warranty.\"There are all sorts of reasons to buy this phone; when the screen was still working, it is a nice-sized phone with good features and clear audio, and has no trouble grabbing a 3G network.
