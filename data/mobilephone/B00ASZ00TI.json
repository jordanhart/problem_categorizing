This is a warning.I bought this xperia to replace a low end samsung gravity whose screen i had cracked. This phone got decent reviews on androidandme.com and the price seemed right, esp for android 4+. Unfortunately:. This phone is painfully slow. Much slower than my old samsung which was android 2+. Imagine every time you press a button or swipe. Then wait many seconds. Sometimes 30 seconds. Then you are about to hit the back/escape button to start over when you see the operation has finally gone through. This happens many times a day. A simpler example: your phone rings, you swipe to answer, then you have to stare at the screen a few seconds to make sure the call has gone through.. I thought i would get a lot more functionality with the higher android but i havent.. The screen is dark and muddy. Even on the brightest setting it's hard to see.. It has a very clunky low end look and feel. Cost $150 looks $50.. Dont make the same mistake i did, thinking you just have to get used to the new phone. Its the phone not you. Now its too late for me to return phone.. Im on a budget. At the time i bought this junk the google nexus 4 was $300. Now its a great buy at $200. I wish i could have that instead. If youre on a stricter budget get a blu phone for about $80. People seem to like it.

The phone is nice looking. The battery doesn't run low much fast, it's ok to be the whole day playing music and whatsapping if fully charged in the morning. But sometimes it gets really slow. It's like it wouldn't be completely awake. I downloaded a thrash cleaner and it became sort of fast again. Even though, don't recommend to use a whole bunch of applications at once. The camera is not the best, nor the worst in good light conditions; avoid taking pictures in cloudy and dark days, they wont work well. Guess that heavy apps and games wouldn't run so fast.

Product I received was not what I thought I was buying. Not to mention the fact that it took about 2 weeks to get to me. Upon trying to return it, customer service was VERY rude. Implied I was unintelligent, and used ALL CAPS occasionally, as though, I couldn't understand what PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE USED meant. Product wan't used. Pulled it out of the box, tried to set it up with my carrier on line, and the phone was recognized as different than what I had thought I purchased.  So I turned it off, contacted the seller, and returned it. I never plugged it into a charger, never changed any settings, never added a single contact, never called or texted a single number. The phone was utterly unused. It had simply been momentarilly turned on. They made the return a huge hassle, being very impolite, unprofessional, and downright rude. At one point, I even had to tell them that there was no need to be so rude. I had to pay return shipping, and even though the shipping on the product was free when I bought it, they then, also deducted shipping from my refund. The refund took about 2 weeks after they received the product, and the refund wasn't even full. They told me the product had been used, and therefore they couldn't refund me fully. The product was NOT used. I'm very upset with the entire scenario that occurred with this seller and I would not recommend them. They are unprofessional, untimely, and have very poor customer service.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for a phone.  If you want a smart phone...try something else.", "Author": "Prabs", "ReviewID": "R10FHLTV4FHICE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If all you really want to do is talk/text and surf the internet occasionally, then this phone's perfect.  Not to mention, it's dual SIM and the color is as nice as the price.Pros:* Nice color.  Amazon doesn't show the color in it's best light.  It really is a rose/bronze with silver undertones?  I don't know how to explain it, but champagne is definitely the color to explain it.  I just think that pics don't show it right.* Dual sim card* Very simple interface.  Pull down menu allows you to quickly switch between cards, turn off/on SIM data traffic (i.e. internet via phone carrier), turn off/on WiFi, turn off/on bluetooth* Sound:  Aside from normal volume control, there is a a menu item for X-loud which uses the internal speaker of the phone to make sounds louder.  Let me tell you...with it off, the loudest setting is not that loud.  But with it on...IT IS LOUD!!!!* Nice design.  Feels good in the hand and not heavy.  Does not need a cover.  The screen is very resistant to fingerprints and scratches.  I have a screen protector even though, and it is scratched already as well as a fingerprint magnet.  That is within days, when I had the phone for a good month before putting on a screen protector and I never had any issues.* Internet while on my home WiFi network is great.  (I usually only turn it on for a quick check on the internet or I keep it on so I can chat via an app I have downloaded)* Google Play store (already loaded is other Google apps as well Facebook extensions etc... I don't use these though)* Has a slot in back to hang a phone charm* Sound quality is really really good.  What do you expect from Sony?  (and I'm not talking about just phone calls, I mean any songs you load onto the phone)Cons:* It is a bit light weight.  If you want something bulkier, this is not for you. The battery cover feels sturdy on, but off is a bit flimsy.* Graphics:  You can tell the quality is not HD.  It's more noticeable if you take a picture or if you are watching YouTube or some video.  That's when you can really tell.* Keyboard:  If you have chubby fingers or like typing vertically (like I do), you will OFTEN hit the wrong keys.  If you aren't much of a texter, this won't matter.* The clock is a bit annoying.  If I leave the clock on as my default while I'm not using it, when I go to use my phone, it will be the same time that it was when I left it.  Only after \"waking it up\" will it change the time and I find that really annoying.  Note that this is ONLY for the clock widget.  The actual time that you see on your phone in the top corner is always running accordingly and correct.* Pics are ok.  Like I said, this is not the best in graphics or resolution.  There is only a back camera, but it has basic features and you can take a quick pic if you need.* Worst thing about the phone that I don't like: In bright light (i.e. out in Sunny California) you will have major issues seeing the screen.  It is all dark and very very difficult to see.  You will have to seek shade or wait until you are indoors to see it properly.* Dual SIM is Dual SIM standby.  You can only use one SIM at a time.  I don't have a problem with this, but if you are meaning to have 2 numbers running at the same time on a phone, this is NOT for you.* SD card can take up to 32 GB.  This is mentioned in the cons as well because a lot of apps require to be put on the phone and will not save to the SD card.  The internal memory is only about 2 GB I think.  So, if you are an app person, this is also not for you.  I only have a few apps (MagicJack, a gchat one and then whatever was pre-installed) so I don't have any issues.I think I might have forgotten some points, but overall I really like the phone.  I bought it from Amazon when it went to $120 something.  I use it for phone/text and occasional internet.  No issues so far regarding those aspects.  I do wish resolution was better and the camera as well...but for what's it's worth, it's good for a basic phone with internet capabilities.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "good product", "Author": "Ra\u00fal L\u00f3pez", "ReviewID": "RA6GXWCGF1KVU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thanks for sending me this product that I really liked ...

I will say this phone has been nothing but a disappointment.The moment I turned the phone on, I noticed I had an update available and updated the phone to JellyBean 4.1.1. From then on, the phone would randomly crash and restart. It then started crashing and restarting whenever the phone screen locked and I tried to unlock it. It would sometimes happen when I used the slide or entered the pin, it didn't really matter which method I tried, it would crash and restart.I have used PC companion to repair the installation several times, as well as Sony's update service and yet the issue exists.

Mediocre pictures in good light- Phone would lock-up if a call was made on one of the SIMs and it was ended before the other other party answered.- Random phone radio/dialer lock-ups (phone looks like it is working but no incoming or outgoing calls)- Random phone restarts- Phone doesn't shutdown after a lock-up, only fix is to remove the batteryThese problems were with NO 3rd party apps installed. Just what was on the phone itself.I regret buying this phone, it would have been better to just use 2 phones rather than this phone. It was bought so we could use it when traveling internationally. The Samsung dual SIM phones all supported 3G only on SIM1 (unlike Sony, Samsung was honest and stated this in their specifications). This phone just like the Samsung phones has one 3G radio which is for SIM1 only.In most countries 3G wouldn't matter for voice calls but if you travel to Japan or South Korea you need a 3G phone/radio, 2G doesn't work at all. Which is why I wanted a dual sim phone that supports 3G on both SIMs. I only found out of this problem while the phone was in Japan, SIM2 radio didn't work at all in Japan. This combined with the radio/dialer lock-up issue caused major problems.This phone was used by my mother (she knows how to use an Android phone just not troubleshoot it) and she had an awful experience with it. The phone lock-up and 3G radio issues left the phone inoperable for long periods during her trip. This made it impossible to communicate since we didn't know what was happening. The phone would work sometimes and not others. We tried several SIMs thinking it was a problem with the wireless service providers. What we didn't realize was that the phone worked for a little while because the battery was taken out and put back in during SIM swaps.This phone caused lots of stress for my mother & others trying to communicate with her during the trip and on her return. The day of her return she spent over two hours waiting at the airport after traveling for over 22 hours. Her flight was early, airport staff routed some passengers through a different terminal she thought we hadn't arrived yet and waited for us thinking we weren't at the airport yet. We arrived early as well because we saw that the flight was ahead of its schedule. We waited for her thinking customs/immigration might be taking time. We tried calling her but couldn't reach her since the phone was locked-up. She tried shutting down the phone (it never shutoff the phone was locked-up). She tried calling us but no calls went through, she thought the wireless service providers were the issue. Luckily she got tried of waiting and a couple of Good Samaritans helped her out, they called me for her so I was able to find her.Save yourself lots of headaches and stress, don't buy this phone.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "The worst Sony product I've ever bought.", "Author": "mussadak elbigou", "ReviewID": "R2FSVR3R4PSYBX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is complicated, user unfriendly and hard to operate.
