{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sold on the new Microsoft environment and the Icon phone is great!", "Author": "Mark S. Millman", "ReviewID": "R2YTLQVGWN2Y5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To put this review in context, I've upgraded my cell phone every couple of years since 1992 when I had my first Motorola brick; so I've owned a lot of cell phones and all the smart ones.  I'm not a fan of Apple products but my spouse has one so I'm not unfamiliar with them.  I'm an IT professional and I've worked with so many different operating systems I've lost count but half a dozen Unix variants, 3-4 Linux Variants, every version of Windows since 1.0, and the Apple OS.  I run both a personal Google Identity and Google Apps for my small business.I've had my phone for a week and I bought the DT910 charger for my desk and the DT900 for traveling.This phone is just wonderful, I gave the Verizon store clerk my Microsoft identity name and added my password when she passed it to me.  By the time I got home the phone had completely synchronized with my desktop and laptop.  It's seamless: just different windows into the same \"ME\".  The sound quality is great; the camera is brilliant (I'm an amateur photographer with several thousand in semi-pro equipment); I can link together all my contacts various identities (google, skype, facebook, etc) into a single unified contact list; Facebook, Kindle, Audible, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft Office, all work great.Before I bought the phone the Verizon folks told me that no one liked the Windows phone because it didn't run all their apps.  And there are some applications that are not available yet for Windows 8.  The only one I miss is TripIt but this is more than made up for by the seamless integration with Microsoft Office.  (Update: I found TripIt)I wanted a working phone that integrated seamlessly into my work environment; gives me a great camera, delivers my core communication needs; the Icon hit that target dead on.  I've never been happier with a new phone.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great upgrade from my iPhone 5", "Author": "John S. Dean \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R1IZ7SANODQI9G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for this phone for a long time.  I got tired of Apple's \"50 shades of grey\" upgrade in IOS7, and so had my Verizon rep for my corporate account send me the Lumia 928 back in September of 2013.  I loved it, and would've ordered one right there until I saw a leaked photo and some tentative specs of the Lumia 929 that was to be released in a couple months.  I decided to wait, since the improvements over the 928 were many.I almost lost patience in November, December, and January when all the rumored release dates passed, but I'm glad I waited.  My rep was able to overnight one to me so I had it on release day.  I gave my old iPhone 5 to one of my employees and never looked back.This is a VERY nice phone in all respects.  In every way I compare it to my iPhone 5, it wins.  The only downside is the thin choice of apps still in the Microsoft store, but that's improving.  The iPhone and Samsung phones started out the same way.  The only things I really miss from the iPhone are a few apps, not the phone itself, since I have a lot of home automation, and there is, as yet, no Windows phone options for my Logitech security cameras, my Ecobee thermostat, and a few of my power switch modules.But apps aside, from a hardware perspective, this is a clear win.  The full 1920x1080 screen is gorgeous to view.  Even in sunlight I can see what I need to see.  I was a little worried about the size for two reasons - first, I didn't want something that was awkward to hold.  I've seen people with the \"phablet\" devices and I just can't picture lugging something like that around as a PHONE - may as well use my retina iPad mini...  But I also just bought a new 2014 Jeep Cherokee Limited, and the technology package in it has a special upper section of the arm rest that includes a Qi charging plate and a little sliding holder to keep the phone there.  I really hoped this would fit in there ,and it did, even with a case on.  Snug, but it works great.  And the increase in resolution over the 928 means that there's more tiles I can fit on the main screen.And for me, that's where the iPhone loses compared to Windows.  I never cared much for the lock screen's lack of information, which was why I invariable jailbroke my iPhones.  And the limited options for the screens when the phone was unlocked made it annoying to have to dig into folders to find what I was looking for, or swipe the screen.  I was very happy when they made folders an option, so you didn't have 20 or 30 pages of icons, but it still was annoying sometimes.  I like that with Windows I can resize the icons and fit  lot of things that I use daily on a single screen.  I also love the live tile implementation of things, so I can see at a glance what's been happening without having to rely on a notification center type of screen.It's easy to hold, since in reality it isn't THAT much larger than the iPhone 5 was.  The buttons are easy to get at and responsive.  I like that they changed the USB port to the bottom, since the 928 had it on the top and that just drove me bonkers during my week of testing.  The sound is quite good for such a small device.The processor is snappy, which makes sense since it's the quad core snapdragon processor.  There's little to no waiting for pretty much anything I open on here.  Graphics are incredible and smooth for the few games I've put on here so far.  Zooming photos or the camera is also very smooth.And the camera - it's amazing.  I have several higher end digital cameras, and an awesome $1600 Sony camcorder, but the photos this turns out are more than acceptable to me.  It used to be I'd \"settle\" for photos with my iPhone due to convenience, when I didn't want to lug my large camera case around with the cameras and lenses for some event.  And yes, if I really want to capture something to the best of my ability, I'll use my real photo equipment.  However, for the other 95% of the time, I'll be more than happy to use my phone now and not have to carry anything else out.  The options are easy to get at, white balance, ISO, flash, so many more options that with the iPhone...  And the single finger zoom, rather than the pinch, or the slider at the one spot on the iPhone, makes bracketing my pictures so much easier.  I find I can get just the shot I want so much easier with this than I could with the iPhone, and the quality, needless to say, just doesn't compare.  The 20 mp camera here and the optics used make you think that there was no way this photo could've been taken by a phone.We have a client in a medical building that's on the lower floor, and in their server room, we NEVER have gotten a signal with any phone from any carrier.  And yesterday I was able to receive a phone call in there, and hear and be heard.  That was a first for our company in that site.  Another pleasure for the phone is being able to hit \"END\" and have it end the call.  I've spent most of my time after the IOS 7 update on my iPhone being unable to end a call myself, it would not respond to me pressing \"END\" no matter how many times I tried.  Phone calls would only end when the other side hung up and my phone realized it.I love the built in Qi charger.  I had a Duracell case for my iPhone and another extended battery that charged on a proprietary pad, and had gotten used to that method of charging.  So I bought two charging pads, one for the office, one for home.  I've gone through three cases so far trying to find a good one, and the charging on the pads and even in my Jeep works through the cases just fine.  It's a convenience that you don't realize you'd use until you get accustomed to it.  No plugs, no cables, just set the phone down and the charging begins, with no special case required like the iPhone.  The back gets a little warm, but I've never felt it get hot no matter how long I had it placed on the charger.This has quite a large battery in it, and initially I thought it'd last longer than the iPhone, but the downside to the live tiles is battery consumption.  With little talking and little game playing, it runs down quicker than you'd think.  I went from 100% at 7 AM at a client site to about 40% left after 8 hours. There's a lot of forum posts out there about things you can do to lessen the impact, but for me I'd rather deal with the battery consumption and have all my data, since this is first and foremost a business tool for me.  Each mail account has its own live tile so I can see at a glance what the status is of new messages for my own Exchange server, or Gmail, or my Windows Live account.  I'm not much of a facebook user but it's there as well, keeping me updated on info for my family.  All of this visible without opening any programs up.  For me, that convenience makes up for the battery being used quicker.Another bonus for me is with my Jeep.  I have the large Uconnect system, that can let you do voice texting over the stereo system.  This never worked with my iPhone, but it works fine with the Icon.  It reads me a text, and I can voice back what my reply is, and the car will repeat what I said and give me the opportunity to accept what it heard, or change it.  Very handy since I don't pull up the phone to send or receive texts and such while driving.  Another thing I don't use much, but it's nice to have when I need to.For me, the lack of an expansion slot for an SD card or something isn't an issue.  I have a Lenovo Helix tablet / laptop that I use for all my data.  I pull photos to it from my Onedrive (used to be Microsoft's Skydrive) so I really don't have a need for extra storage on the phone.  But for some people who use a phone as their center of their digital existence, it will be a major issue.  So if you absolutely must have additional storage on the device, this may not be for you.  But with the the seamless cloud storage integration, I don't think it's that critical for a lot of people.And I like that I have such a viable option for Microsoft Office documents here, that I can open a Word document from my Onedrive and it looks like I expect it to, and that I can edit it and then have the results later on my computer when I'm back at the office.All in all, I'm 100% happy with the hardware, just a little impatient with developers of the programs I need for home automation to make a Windows Phone variant of their software.  There's nothing I feel I lost in my transition from the iPhone, I've only gained.  For me, this is a much more usable phone in all respects than my iPhones ever were.  And it's a big step from the old Windows Mobile phones back in 2007 and 2008.This is one phone that shows that the Windows Phone platform isn't just a fluke, and it has all the opportunities to flourish.  Of course, that success isn't in Microsoft's hands, but in the hands of the people who write apps.  It doesn't matter how awesome a phone is, if people can't get the things they want or need to run on it, most of them will stick with the platform that they can.  So I really hope the Microsoft store starts fleshing itself out.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Expereince from a Windows Smartphone", "Author": "Cos", "ReviewID": "R1ZOULP6LGHPYT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a sickness... I love to upgradeI have been with the Android Operating System since the original Sprint EVO Phone. To put things in perspective. I have had the EVO, EVO 3D (Junk) traded to the Motorola Photon, Motorola Droid Razor Max, to the HTC One. I have played around with unlocking, using custom roms, etc. Android is a great OS, tons of apps and a ton of phone choices. Given all this, why would I even consider switching.....I am boredWhen it comes down to it, most of the apps I use now are mainly for work, when I want to play games, browse the web, etc I use my Ipad Air.I wanted a phone for work and I wanted to try something new, so the Lumia Icon had the latest specs, so I decided to give the Windows phone a try. For me it's a hit, with a few missesUNPACKING (7/10)\u2022Your basic rectangular Verizon (orange) box nothing spectacular\u2022inside it is well packed with the phone, wall charger and usb cable, small printed manual\u2022This is version 8 of the Windows Mobile OS, 8.1 is not released yet\u2022Phone is boxy, with a significant amount of weight behind it, which detracts away from its excellent design, button layout, metal trim with polycarbonate back\u2022Camera has Duel LED Flash in the back with Headphone jack up top and Charger at bottom\u2022Phone feels heavy in your hands, but even with its larger bulk it fits wellDISPLAY (9/10)This is where the phone shines, I really like the screen, it's AMOLED 1920x1080 screen. I agree with most of the professional reviews, colors are very vivid and bright, with excellent black levels, but fall a tad short on whites when compared to my HTC ONE. I do like the fact that you have a lot of customization when it comes to screen color brightness, etc. I put this phone next to my buddies Samsung Galaxy 4, and it just looked a tad bit better IMO. With the very thin border around the screen it give the illusion that the screen takes up the entire front. I did change the color scheme of windows, because the red was just to bright.BATTER LIFE (8/10)The battery life is quite good, I would say it's better than my HTC in that regards, but not by a lot. I do about 100+ emails a day, will watch an occasional Netflix program back and forth on the train and talk a lot for my job and still manage to finish the day with 25-30% left. This is only with 2 actual days of usage, but so far so good.USER INTERFACE (9/10)This is my first experience with the Windows 8 Mobile OS. If not for windows 8 on my PC, I probably would have never even tried this phone, because it looks like a big mess at first, but in the end, I was really won over by how much I could customize it vs. my HTC One.When I first turned on my phone, its was the basic walkthrough setup process, then I got to the screen and thought, OK what the hell do I do now? Turns out I was able to do a lot and was able to pick up the OS in a very short period of time with no instruction. I was able to do/learn things quickly and have quickly grown to love the tile system as it is PERFECT for me and how I want to customize my screen vs. android widgets.With high end specs it compares similarly to android devices in relation to speed, pinch zoom and scrolling, all work really well.EXAMPLE: By adjusting the tile and location of the apps I use most I was better able to maximize screen real estate better than any android phone I have used. I have the Phone tile next to my two email address tiles with the next row being my calendar voicemail, and weather forecast. In the same amount of space I have my less used apps as tiny tiles which I can put 4 into the same size as one tile. To me this is the biggest advantage of the windows phone as I can get to more of my apps quickly. While android purists may say they can do the same on their device, the point for me was how easy it was to do this with almost no knowledge of the OS to begin with.Additional observations, I think some of the same apps work better on the Windows OS. I definitely liked the LinkedIn and ebay apps much better than the android counterpart. That being said, there is often times I found the Android App to be the better choice.I do prefer the Android app access (i.e. 4column x5 rows vs Window OS 1 column scroll down and give my HTC the advantage of having a better media player.CALL QUALITY (8/10)This one is difficult to judge as its T-Mobile vs Verizon and to be honest the HTC One is the King of Sound Quality with its 2 speaker system. As far as making calls, I found the call quality to be equal on both. On the flipside, the HTC's speakerphone is significantly better, as it is against pretty much any device. I know that Nokia changed out the Mics on these headsets and I have no complaintsAPPS, APPS AND MORE APPS (6/10)If you are an App junkie, as I used to be, the Windows phone is NOT for you. They still have a long way to go to compete with either the Android or Apple ecosystem. I do NOT have HBOgo, VUDU, Amazon Prime Video, just Netflix. Other than that, it does have all the apps that I use for work (navigation, backups, Office) I like the Bing Finance app to track my investments and the Travel app for booking tickets.  I also have problems with bugs on some apps, like my fitnesspal which worked fine on my android and Ipad, but required constant reinstalls to keep it going.CAMERA (9/10)Lumia is know for the excellent camera's and this is an area where it doesn't disappoint. Picture quality is excellent. Compared to my HTC one it stays if focus a lot better when moving around and overall picture quality seems significantly better. I have not been able to do a low light comparison, but the double LED flash on the Nokia vs Single LED on the HTC makes a noticeable difference. I have not played around with the customization and overall features, but will update when I have had more time. This is an area on the Nokia that seems like it's going to take a little bit of learning.NOTE: Shutter Speed, as reported on other sites is an issue, (i.e. Shutter Delay), but nothing is too significant for most general picture taking, but I could see having an impact on action shots.I could go into a lot more detail, but with one of usability, I would rate this phone an (8/10) Pros: - Excellent Screen - Easy to use and customizable interface and speedy - Solid build Quality - Good Battery Life (wireless charging works great) - Clear call quality - FANTASTIC Camera Cons: - A phone should not be this bulky in this day and age - Speakerphone volume could be a little louder - Apps....MS still has a ton of catch upOn a side note I am excited to see with the OS 8.1 brings, especially the Cortana (siri / Google Voice) competitor.

This phone is by far the most amazing and fun device I have ever owned. After I set it up it just feels alive! ALL other phones I have used were static and feel boring by comparison, I shopped around for my new phone for several months and decided on the Nokia Icon.Physically, the fit and finish is the best I have ever used. The buttons are nice and the travel on them is as close to perfect as I can imagine. I had to see the screen to appreciate it. The colors pop like nothing else I've seen in a mobile device. Although the phone is similar in physical size to other phones with 4\"-4.5\" screens this one is 5\" and goes from edge to edge. The phone has built-in wireless charging, NFC and no camera bump. Unlike the iPhone I can talk and use the internet at the same time on Verizon.The primary function I use my phone for besides calls and texting is picture-taking. The 20mp camera is nothing short of jaw-dropping. The images are extremely detailed and the best I have ever seen. Nokia has really spent a lot of time and effort making the camera great. They also created several apps to do cool things with the images. Refocus allows me to decide what I want in focus after shooting the picture. Cinemagraph allows animation in the picture while the rest remains static.There are some of the most innovative and useful apps exclusive to this platform. Photobeamer allows me to share the pictures from my phone with anyone's computer screen. Nokia Beamer allows me to share my phone's screen with anyone, anywhere on their computer. HERE Drive+ has complete offline maps so I don't use ANY data! HERE Maps with LiveSight is totally awesome. When I turn the phone vertically to look down the street, it superimposes the businesses so I see businesses. The images are links to their websites, menus, reviews, etc. DataSense minimizes data which saves $ and allowed me a smaller data plan. Wallet is built-in and seamless for purchases.Windows Phone comes with Kid's Corner built-in. I have 4 children who always want to play games on my phone including Flappy Bird, Angry Birds and whatever else is out there. This allows them to use it without fear of messing up anything up I have control of what they can access to anything I don't want them using.If you are considering something new, different, and innovative... this is a phone worth checking out!", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "AWESOME PHONE", "Author": "Jeff and Andrea Bailey", "ReviewID": "R107Y37D56GR0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast and responsiveTile interface is easy to useNokia apps are 2nd to noneCall quality is very goodCamera ROCKS!", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "After 4-5 years on Android...", "Author": "KOLE", "ReviewID": "R6CPI1ZGG3H47", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found a true \"premium\" phone.

I loved my RAZR until Jelly Been made it slow.  I have a Samsung Note 3 and 8 at work for a pilot and as well as iPad mini and Air so I am invloved with all of them.  The Apple products are well built and run well but to me are just boring and I do not see the value of paying the extra cost.

I have a Nikon DSLR but I don't always want to carry it obviously.  I tested the Note 3 and I have the iPhone 4S and the Icon camera is far better. It is quick and the I have only had one out of focus picture while my son and I where ice skating so both of us where in motion.  The camera button makes it easy to take those kind of pictures and I have not had any issues with pressing that button and getting a clear picture.I am not an app junky and every app that I had on my Droid RAZR is on the Icon.  I do miss the \"Desk Mode\" of the RAZR which presented me a nice clock and access to my important features while in the dock, but with how fast the Icon is, it takes no time to get into the home screen which is basically the same.I read some \"professional\" review that said they would not buy it for the lack of a notification center?  The whole home screen is a notification center!  I also have a banner that alerts me of a notification so I am not sure what they are talking about.The colors on the display are amazing.

I get very attached to my devices, and I was heartbroken last summer when my Droid Bionic's battery was shot and I traded it in for a Galaxy S4. However, the S4 completely blew my Bionic out of the water and I had some good times with it until it broke, and Verizon refused to replace it despite it still being under warranty. A family member got this phone for free and gave it to me to check out, and I love it.-The Windows Phone 8 OS is great. Everything runs so fast. If you play around a bit with the size/location of the icons on the homescreen, you can fit a lot in there which is nice.-Everyone complains about the lack of apps, and this is unavoidable. There are a lot more of the well used apps than when I originally looked into a Windows phone last summer, and more are becoming available by the day. There are also unofficial apps for many popular apps not present in the store that are awesome alternatives. (I like the unofficial Snapchat app (6snap) more than I like the official Android snapchat app).-I've seen complaints about the battery life, but for me it feels pretty comparable to my S4. With basic usage (phone calls/texts throughout the day) I can easily make it through an entire on a charge. If I'm using it more heavily, especially when streaming music from Spotify, then it may only take me to 9-10pm without charging it throughout the day. Vast improvement to my Bionic, and pretty comparable to my S4.-As many others have said, the camera on this phone is amazing. There is a slight shutter delay that can be annoying, but the picture quality makes it all worth it.-The build of the phone is a bit heavy/bulky (especially if you're coming from an iPhone). It's not something that bothers me, but always something to consider if that's an issue for you.-Finally, as many have said, the GPS/Nokia maps on this phone are absolutely incredible. You have the ability to download maps and use turn by turn navigation offline, which is super nice if you don't want to blow through your data just using navigation. It's very accurate (more so than Google Maps in my opinion) and gives good directions.So yes, if you're considering making the switch to a Windows Phone, or if you want to upgrade your current Windows Phone, this would be a great option for you.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Satisfied", "Author": "AD", "ReviewID": "R3K920MWY1M46X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned this phone for a month. This is a great phone. The OS feels fresh and modern. The hardware is high quality, very classy and elegant.I have experience with the competition as well.

Haven't restarted it once.-Well made handset. Feels solid. Looks great. I love the beveled glass.-Nokia apps! Their maps and nav apps alone are the best I've used.-Live tiles, and GUI. I much prefer this OS over the other two. It just feels \"right\". The others seem outdated and sluggish. IMO this is the biggest pro, as the actual power of the other high end phones are slightly worse or slightly better than this phone. It's all about the experience.-Camera is insanely good. I've never been able to print phone pics before because they're too grainy. Not the case with the icon.-OneNote. Awesome note taking app from MS.Cons:-Internet explorer stinks. No back button usage if you wake the app up from the tile. Works if you open it from the task manager.-App store is a hellhole. The apps are supposed to be screened and approved by MS. MS needs better screening. All the apps I need are there and then some. But the store is cluttered with junk apps and nonsense.-Some Third party apps are not as good here as they are on other phones. Not matured is a good word. But usable.-Google and microsoft hate eachother. Therefore google doesn't develop for WP...yet.-Battery.

It is dramatically better, which is surprising because it looks about the same but with a 1/2 inch bigger screen.

With the larger screen you can get up to 6 tiles across (compared to 4 w/ 928) and the screen resolution is so good even very small text is easy to ready.  Microsoft and Nokia also released some really nice apps that take advantage of the extra real-estate on the screen.  For instance, the Bing Weather app (best weather app ever) shows current weather and switches to week forecast occasionally.  Why don't all weather apps do this - it is all you really need and you don't need to launch the app as much.  All of my important apps now fit on the one screen without scrolling, and with the extra information from the apps I really get a good view of my life on one screen.

And here's why:1. The \"incorrect password\" bug. It's something that seems to happen across all brands and models of Windows 8 phones, and if you can't fiddle around with the wifi for whatever reason, you are stuck using only the data plan on the phone. I can't get it to work on my wifi connection even though multiple computers and several other cell phones have no issue whatsoever with it. There are several threads on this at the Microsoft help website, and they all suggest trying to fiddle with the settings, and MAYBE it will work--if it can't just work like every other thing we've tried to hook up to it, it's probably not worth messing around with. I don't have the time or inclination to fuss with it. (Search WP8 won't connect to wifi on Microsoft's website)*Update* I finally got it to work with wifi, but it doesn't like my wifi hotspot (from another carrier). It's kind of hit or miss when it comes to hotspots, but seems to work fine on networks that use an actual router and/or don't have a password. I'm not going to pretend to understand it, that's just been how it has worked for me.2. The bluetooth in my car worked just fine with my old \"dumb phone\" and works perfectly with my husband's iPhone. This phone simply won't play nice though. I can't get it to download the phone book so the convenience of \"hands free\" doesn't exist. The sound from it over the bluetooth fades in and out so it's hard to hear the person on the other end of the call. This appears to also be a known issue and there are threads about it on Microsoft's website dating back to 2012--if this hasn't been fixed yet, I wouldn't plan on it happening. (Search connect to car bluetooth on Microsoft's website)*Update* I got it to transfer my contacts--twice! If you can't get your contacts to transfer to your car, try having your phone book pulled up on your phone when you tell the car bluetooth to download your contacts. My old phone and the iPhone didn't require that, but it seems to be what is necessary to get the Icon and my car to \"talk\" to each other. It was either that or my dogged persistence that made it finally decide to work.3. It's just kind of huge. You don't really know how a phone is going to feel until you've made a phone call with it--my hand started cramping up from holding it after about 10 minutes. If I can't use it to talk to grandma, there's no point in having a phone. And when I'm trying to drive? Fuhgeddaboudit.4. The ringers aren't very loud or long. I need to be able to hear it ring from another room or over a crying baby (or sometimes both!) and this phone doesn't cut it. I've got the ringer maxed out and it's just not very loud; and whether it's laying face up or face down doesn't seem to make much difference either. The notifications for calendar events only \"ding\" at you once and then the notification just shows up on the screen until you hit snooze or dismiss. My old phone would raise holy heck until you told it that you got the memo--I miss that feature.5. The support system. You can either post on Microsoft's website community (which if you do the above searches will show that there's a lot of frustrated users, but no real answers) or you can use Twitter. How they expect you to solve a problem over Twitter is beyond me. I'm pretty sure you get a new person every tweet and they ask you variations the same question over and over in an endless loop. And heaven help you if you have more than one issue!! Plus it's just such a long, drawn out process even if you have nothing else going on besides staring at your twitter feed all day.That being said, I'm really sad about returning it, because there are a lot of features that I love about it.1. The camera. It's as phenomenal as everyone said it would be. Love. I'm not a photographer, but the camera takes such good pictures that I look like I might have a smidgen of talent. And the editing software is pretty awesome too, though I haven't played around with it as much.2. Driving mode. It's probably weird, but I love that little feature. Even though I'm VERY anti-texting-and-driving, it's very hard to keep yourself from trying to find your phone when you hear the \"ding\". This way it just doesn't let the message dinger go off, so I can find out later. It also sends the person a text back saying I'm driving, so that they can call me if it's urgent...or at least in theory they could.3. The OS is very easy to use. I came from a dumb phone and have had no trouble picking up the interface. I love the live tiles, though I wish there was a way to hover over to know for sure which icon is what without having to click on it--that's only because I'm still learning though, I doubt I'd need it after a couple of weeks.4. The office suite that comes with it. I had intentions of buying a Surface Pro to go with this phone, but now I'm rethinking that. Maybe the tablet will still work well with whichever OS I end up with, but probably not as seamlessly as I was hoping. Still though, this phone would be awesome for someone who is serious about doing work.5. Others have mentioned issues with the app store, but I found all the apps I needed there. The trick can be finding them. I had better luck going to the website on the phone (ie Twitter) and then getting directed to the app from there vs. searching. To me, the lack of games and flashlight apps were irrelevant though, because this is a phone that will be for making phone calls and doing work stuff instead of playing flappy bird. If you want a toy, buy a toy; if you want a work phone, buy this one (and then hope like heck you don't have the same issues I did!).6. I really loved the responsiveness and clarity of the screen. I didn't need to tap anything multiple times to get it to work, and the picture is really clear even outside. And I suppose I'll mention here that I didn't know at first how to shut stuff off (I know, I know, RTFM already), so I had all kinds of programs open at one point and it never bogged down. Also, it has little videos you can watch that show how to use the phone, once I found those, they had some great tips on them like pressing and holding the \"back\" button to see what programs are open--which is how I discovered that I had a bunch of stuff open.7. I really liked how intuitive the texting was--I mean, as big as the phone is it kind of has to be fairly good at guessing what you want to type or it would be a royal PITA, but it's really good.8. This is pretty petty, but I just kind of liked being a rebel and having something different than the masses. I don't mind the the other OS's, but it seems like everyone and their dog has an iPhone or a GS3, and I hate doing/having what everyone else does.Overall, I'm torn on whether I would recommend this phone or not. Obviously, it isn't working out for me, but if those issues don't seem like dealbreakers to you (or you have more patience/time/tech savvy to make it work), you'll probably love it. It has a lot of little things that I loved, but the cons were pretty major to me.

I had 3 Android phones and I was getting bored of them. It was all the same. The phone would perform great at the beginning and then start to lag (with the removing of some Apps issues). The final straw was the Samsung Galaxy S3. The RF and voice quality was not great (Was nothing Like my Moto Droid X [great mobile]).  The Nokia screen quality is unbelievable and the RF is fantastic. I get signal in areas that I did not get with my GS3 (Like the back of my Grocery store) and I can put the phone down on my car console and still have GPS signal. I use this phone for business and home and the quality of Microsoft applications and services is outstanding (I would always get jealous of my friends IPhones and the business capabilities it had). I am not a download every app person, but I found all my apps I had on my GS3( was surprised that Waze was available with an update only couple weeks old), including local papers and bank. The battery seems to last for a while, but I am never far from some type of charger with any of my mobiles products. It did take me a week to get use to the Windows environment. At one point in the beginning I was not sure why I left my Android platform, but once I got used to the windows 8 OS I love it. I have tiles to show my information and not have to worry about widgets. I can not forget the unbelievably great camera quality.  There is a superiorness (Not sure that is a real word) about the Lumia Icon and Windows 8 platform that makes me think I might end up being a real fan. I purchased my Lumia at the Verizon store so I had customer support answering questions I had.

Everyone in the reviews keeps saying how wonderful the cam is but compared to my S4 and Note 3 the pics are not as good.The tiled menu interface is OK, i can get used to that but the lack of the apps in the app store is a real downer.  The handful of popular apps they do have seem outdated and very badly written.  For example, Facebook on this phone reminds of Facebook on the BlackBerry Bold, very clunky, things don't load fast and smooth, inability to do simple things that you take for granted with other operating systems, like \"clicking like\" on a pic.The \"People\" stream/interface is horrid, it pulls in info from all over the place but when you click on a item it gives you a very bad/limited view of how to interact back.The feel of the phone was nice and i have to say that the speakerphone and the call quality were superb, probably the best call quality i have heard in a long time on any phone so kudos to that.Other things like having to go into settings, then into WIFI, to join a network is a pain, there should be a toggle switch somewhere for that but there isnt.Im not saying this is a horrible phone but just my honest opinion of it.  Anything i use that slows me down is just not for me, this phone completely slowed me down.  Even the email formatting is a pain, to view images you have to click \"view images\" in every email, there is no default option to have it view images.
