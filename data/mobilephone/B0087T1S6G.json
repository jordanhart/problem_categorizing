{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For the price an excellent phone", "Author": "K. Burke", "ReviewID": "R5WU3IAUADPWR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd been stuck with a Droid X on another big carrier for nearly 2 years and my X started acting wacky, and since the X was out of warranty my options were to buy an expensive upgrade or walk away from it. Since I had Virgin Mobile phones for my wife and kid I took the leap and walked. Happy I did.I'd gotten my wife an Optimus Elite a few weeks before and it is definitely a nice little phone for the price, and was thinking about getting one for myself, but I was leaning towards going the power route and getting the Evo V 4G. Luckily - just in time, as they just came out - I ran across the HTC One V first. After a bit of research and weighing the options, I decided that I was tired of carrying around big, bulky phones, and that I really didn't need the extra power and capability the Evo has, so I picked up a One V. I don't talk much, use texting more, so the $35/month plan fits me perfectly, and at that price and for only $200 up front this is a steal. Now, to the phone itself...It is a very compact phone, very light, yet does not at all feel cheap. No plastic backing, this one has a real aluminum unibody that both looks and feels great and offers much better protection than cheaper plastic units. It has Gorilla Glass on the screen as well, so right out of the box this phone is more solidly constructed than most of the competition. I dropped it my second day (my hands still being used to gripping a big-screened monstrosity) and it took quite a tumble before it hit the floor, picked it up and brushed it off, not a scratch and kept walking. It has a no frills appearance to it that I find aesthetically pleasing as well. Slides right in and out of the pocket, don't even notice it's there. I like that coming from a big phone that you have to struggle with to get out of the pocket.The screen is nice and vibrant. Not the best out there but it is crisp and very responsive, with every indication of quality. Decent viewing angles. I find the 3.7\" just small enough to still be easily usable and easy to type on, and still big enough for some gaming and video. Big screens are nice for those things, but I think they hit the sweet spot with 3.7\" - big enough but not so big as to make the phone itself too big.The ICS operating system is very smooth, noticeably more refined (and simpler, once you get used to it) than previous versions. I don't even care if this phone ever gets Jelly Bean or not, I am perfectly happy with ICS. App compatability has been very good so far - nearly every app I had loaded on the X (and every single one I use regularly) works fine on this one, which is surprising since this one is so new.Under the hood this one has similar specs to what my Droid X had: a 1Ghz Snapdragon processor and 512MB of RAM. Higher end phones nowadays are sporting dual and even quad core processors paired with 1GB of RAM, but really, what do you need that for? Pretty much newer graphically intense gaming, which I don't really do with my phone (I have an Acer Iconia Tab A100 for that). I do light gaming on the phone, and for that this works just fine (although even this one will play many of the higher end games like Shadowgun, it's just not as smooth as the S3s of the world). As for other apps the hardware in the One V runs everything just fine with very little to no lag, so I'm not missing those extra cores and extra RAM. Note that if you intend to do serious gaming on your phone then this one is not for you, but if you are just a casual phone gamer then this works just fine.The GPS is possibly the brightest spot on this phone - it is simply phenomenal. I toggle the GPS on, hop into GPS Status and *immediately* acquire 8 satellites - indoors. Then open maps and see that it has located me to within about 3-5 meters. I sometimes had to wait up to 5 minutes for my Droid X to get a position, this one took about 5 seconds.The camera is not bad at all. The Droid X had an 8MP camera, this one a 5MP camera, and I can't tell the difference in quality. It does, however, have a neat little function where you can hold down the shutter button for a few seconds and it takes multiple pics rapidly, and lets you pick the one you want to keep. This is VERY handy for capturing stills of moving targets. Also, there is little to no shutter lag, which also helps.Battery life has been pretty good so far. After about 10 hours at work doing some browsing, light gaming, some tunes, fiddling with GPS a bit, and no recharging I get home with anywhere from 20-40% remaining. That is perfectly adequate for me.Cell reception seems to be quite good for me so far. I get decent 3G signal and download speed even when walking in an underground train tunnel and in areas where other big carrier phones don't. I had expected worse from a no-contract carrier, but am pleasantly surprised. I understand this will vary greatly depending upon location, but where I live it is very good. Call quality has also been good on both ends.Wifi and Bluetooth work fine. I was even able to tether my tablet using FoxFi and run it off of Bluetooth... To save my data plan I turn on Wifi whenever I have access (like as soon as I get home). The 3G is for when I am out and about, and I should have no problem bumping up against VM's throttle limit of 2.5GB of data. That would only really be a problem if one was streaming lots of video or music, which I don't do.So, in conclusion, is this a top of the line phone? No, if you want that then you will get a contract with a big carrier, and you will pay alot for it. For me, and I suspect for most users out there, this phone does what I need it to do, and it does it well. If the Galaxy S3 is top of the line, and say a Droid Razr is runner up, then this one would place third. But I am factoring the cost into my evaluation, and the cost for a One V from VM is *much* less than those types of phones, and you get a platform that does pretty much the same stuff for the vast majority of users out there. And the monthly bill is far easier to swallow. Even if you get the $55/month unlimited everything plan and add the $5 insurance (worth it IMO) it's still far less than you will be paying on any smartphone contract. As an example, our 2 smartphone contract with the old carrier with 700 minutes cost us just under $200/month, while 3 smartphones with VM with 1800 minutes total cost us $120/month. More phones + more minutes + lower monthly cost = Win every day of the week.And one of the best things: you are not stuck with this phone. Phones become obsolete quickly, generally long before the 2 years is up on contract. About a year into the contract you're sitting there fiddling with your phone looking at the cool new stuff everyone is playing with and thinking \"Oh great, I'm stuck with this thing for another year...\". You have no easy ability to upgrade; you either pay a huge penalty to do so or you are just stuck with what you have, which will certainly be obsolete after the first year. With these you can just toss the phone and upgrade easily any time you want, and the new phones aren't that expensive. That is probably my favorite feature of all.So if you are in the market for a decent no-contract phone and don't need the bells and whistles of the Evo or want it's size and bulk, this is a fantastic choice. The phone itself is not a 5 star phone, I'd give it 3.5-4 stars in today's environment - but realistically that is perfectly fine for 95% of the users out there. Most people do not actually need the uber-cool hardware of the latest release, they just need something that works, and this one does. Factoring in the cost and the flexibility of going off-contract is what gets it to 5 stars. And if you are looking at the Optimus Elite I'd recommend considering the One V; it's worth the extra $50. The OE is a nice little phone and worth its price, but this one is better; my wife is already bugging me to get her one...Oh, and BTW - Otterbox already has a case out for these, and it is great. Amazon has them, too.UPDATE: So, been running this phone for a few weeks now, and I am still liking it alot. A few comments:Battery: most Android phones take a week or two to learn the user's patterns and optimize themselves, and this one is no exception. During the first week or so I had some days where it almost died on me, but now it knows me and is sipping juice. It's not abnormal for me to get home with close to 50% battery left now, which is quite good, I think. The inability to remove the battery will not be an issue, as by the time this battery goes bad (they all do eventually) this phone will be obsolete and it will be time to replace it anyway. Tough it out through those first couple of weeks and you won't be disappointed in this battery.OS: ICS is running very smooth. I had a couple of FCs at first but as with the battery, it smoothed itself out and is running nearly to perfection now. App compatibility is still phenomenal for a relatively new phone.Cell signal: During the first week I had 3-4 instances where the phone lost 3G signal, but I don't fault it much as I was deep within a heavy metal structure building and buried under lots of concrete. It hasn't happened since, and when it did it found the signal again within a minute, so not exactly a big deal. I have since traveled across state (TX, a big one) and found cell reception / 3G to be quite good pretty much everywhere. I never noticed any areas where I couldn't get a signal. Running on Sprint's network I didn't expect any problems in this area, and haven't really found any; they have a very well developed network and their expansion is ongoing. Also, as more people move onto 4G networks it makes 3G easier to ride.GPS: the GPS continues to impress me. It isn't always immediate as in my first review, but it is always fairly fast (generally less than 20 seconds for multiple satellite lock). It is most definitely a real GPS, too, and not just some AGPS tomfoolery. It works fine in Airplane Mode and where there is no cell signal... Just know that you will need preloaded maps or have one downloaded via Wifi for it to be of any use if you are going out of network (there are several good apps to do this with, I personally like MapDroyd and Backcountry Navigator Pro, respectively, for their given applications).Camera: I am still liking the camera, too. When trying to snap photos of moving objects/people just hold the shutter button down until it's passed and then select the pic you want to keep - very handy function. The quality is not great, but not bad either. Perfectly acceptable for a phone camera. The only issue I have with the camera is the zoom - not very good there. But fine for anything close up.The wife is bugging me every day now to get her one, don't think I'll be able to hold off much longer. Taken as a whole, this phone and the plan price tag is a fantastic value, and it does everything I need it to do. Still highly recommended.Oh, and Trident now has a nice looking case out for these. They are generally on par with Otterbox and offer another alternative. Mine will continue to wear the Otterbox for now, as I am happy with it.UPDATE 2: After uninstalling a few apps, I am now coming home with 60% battery or so. I NEVER came close to that with the X. I took off some widget apps and just run with the stock weather/clock widget (which is actually pretty good), took off Sonic 4 Ep 1 and the Alarm Clock app, and voila! One or more of those apps was running in the background; the phone also doesn't get hot anymore unless I am REALLY pushing it... It is smooth as silk now.I can't say enough about this phone, or the fact that it only costs me $40 a month with insurance.UPDATE 3: After a couple of months I finally broke down and got the wife one. Ordered a Trident case for it. Like I said in the earlier review, one of the great things about these no contract phones is you can upgrade anytime you want. So the wife upgrades from the Optimus Elite to the One V, and the kid gets to upgrade from an Optimus V to an Optimus Elite. Everyone wins.And mine is still running great. It's probably the most problem-free smartphone I've seen so far. Still highly recommend it.UPDATE 4: Quick status update, it's New Year's, 2013, and this phone is still going strong for both me and the wife. Still a great deal, especially at the prices it's been selling at lately. I bought it for twice what it's selling at now... I'd do it all over again at the original price. That is how happy I've been with the phone.UPDATE 5: All good things must come to an end. One of the great things about the VM line is that it's easy to upgrade whenever you want to since you're not on contract. I tried out an EVO V 4G for awhile, and it's a decent phone, but I've finally found the sweet spot with the Samsung Galaxy Victory 4G LTE. It is using Sprint's 4G LTE and it's simply a quantum leap forward. Price point is not bad at all either, and it's on sale right now for less than I paid for my One V...The One V was a great phone, it did everything I needed and functioned well. But the future lies in 4G LTE networks. Jump on VM's next big ship and take a ride, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent performance at a decent price", "Author": "N. Savoiu", "ReviewID": "R21W3OS1R8QPC7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone feels sturdy thanks to an aluminum casing. The design is minimalistic and rather industrial looking (the bottom \"lip\" has a brushed aluminum texture) so it won't win any cuteness awards.Both call quality and signal reception seem adequate. The sound quality when playing music is very good (especially with BeatsAudio enabled) although I find the volume to be a bit too high even on the lowest setting especially in a quiet environment. I've informed HTC of this and they will hopefully address it. I also like to ability to control the music player from a locked screen but just wish that the album art would be displayed in a larger size (like in the HTC Wildfire S). I've bugged HTC about this as well so here's to hoping!Battery life also seems good. After a few hours of music playing and some app/web activity it was still past half full. I'm however skeptical of the \"embedded\" nature of the battery. And this is the main reason for just the 4 stars rating. This means that once the battery degrades (and they all do) you'll probably have to have HTC replace it or chuck the phone. However, chances are that by then you'll probably want to upgrade anyway.If you're coming from Android 2.3.x (as most of users are) it will take a bit to get adjusted to Android 4.x. Most things are still where you'd expect them to be but subtle changes are throughout. Most notable the Search and Settings buttons are gone and instead there's a \"Recent Apps\" button which also acts as Settings button for apps. To search however you'll need to touch a screen widget.I'm upgrading from a HTC Wildfire S so here are my thoughts relative to that.1. Improved app storage space (900MB instead of 150MB) makes it easier to install apps without having to resort to tricks: App2SD, Link2SD or rooting the phone. I'm quite irked that spec list 4GB as the storage space but really 900MB are truly available to use. Also, unlike other phones it does not come with any microSD card but you can add one up to 32GB in size and have a lot of room for songs, pictures, videos.2. Improved screen (800x480) is crisp and with good colors3. True FM Radio is still there but again HTC's own radio widget does not work (use Spirit FM instead)4. Processor speed is also improved (I can now stream Netflix and use Skype over WiFi without a problem)All in all it's a good low-to-mid level smart phone that will work quite well for most users.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great!; Not Good, Not Best", "Author": "A. Adesokan", "ReviewID": "REKHK7AP2F2P1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So if you're reading this, it means you use Virgin Mobile, so you're my mind of person--savvy. Let's see if we can help each other out.Android 4.0.3--This is a cool operating system, in that it runs smoothly and looks sleek, but coming from 2.2.1, I have to say that though the transitions and features look cooler, you're not missing much. Moreover, you know how you used to be able to hit a button on your Android 2.x phone and settings/options would come up, no matter what app you were running? This doesn't exist anymore. You can still get to settings on most apps, but it's a lot less intuitive and I don't think app developers have fully caught up yet. Also, the phone doesn't come preloaded with Swype, you have to download it and it eats up a little RAM. That said, if you like your apps (and who doesn't?), you're going to have to come on board the Ice Cream truck because it won't be long before developers stop making them for older systems.HTC Sense--A few weeks ago, I bought an LG Optimus Slider on Virgin Mobile and couldn't take it anymore after less than a fortnight. Don't waste your time buying an LG. The Motorola Triumph competes in this price range, but I've never used it, and it's still on Android 2.2.5.0 Camera--You know how your friends with iPhones take pictures that make your phone's pictures look like children's sketches? The gap is smaller now, but not by a lot.Beats Audio--Ever the cynic, I have to admit that Beats Audio is an actual thing! It's not just slapped on the phone to piggy-back off a successful line. The phone's speaker produces good audio, the volume gets loud (much louder than my LG Optimus Slider) and it actually seems to make the quality of sound coming out of my headphones better. Two thumbs up, Dr. Dre!Battery Life--With JuiceDefender (if you don't have it, get it) enabled at the balanced profile, the phone lasts about one day, one night. Keep in mind that I don't game or use it very heavily.RAM--The RAM was actually sort of a let down. It's advertised as 500 MB, but seems to only use around 362 MB. For me the phone was lagging a bit until I decided to quit Talkatone when I wasn't using it. Now it runs fine. But if you plan on gaming a lot, you should probably (definitely!) get a different phone.Left-side note: Without afore-mentioned ultra-useful dedicated-settings key, there is no way for me to quit Talkatone without manually doing so through settings, a mild pain in the yash.Right-side note: Talkatone is a program that lets you call people through a free Google voice number for free WITHOUT eating up your 300 minutes/month. It does eat up some bandwidth, but you can always run it on WIFI and save your monthly 3G quota. You should get it.Also, the phone doesn't come with a memory card, which sort of seems like a reminder to us pre-paid phone users that we're somehow second-class citizens.Lastly, please use this Kickback code upon activation so you and I can get 60 free minutes: EC6O4VDG.

I really did not want to pay 130 dollars a month for a fancy phone I don't use often so this company seemed like a good idea.I got a new phone with cricket, my first smartphone ever, and it was awesome (again it was my first smartphone) I noticed, I only got 1 or 2 bars anywhere I went. When I called, they said I had to basically pay for a new phone... that wasn't happening. So after some researching, I found virgin mobile and their phones.I really liked the reviews on this phone so I gave it a try.Two months later and this is an awesome phone. It has yet to freeze up on me in the slightest way, the battery life is amazing. I'm a manager at a pizza chain, so I'm constantly making calls to drivers, customers, ect. And this phone can last the whole day.I'm 19 so playing around on the internet is somewhat common (haha) , I can watch videos, download, upload, go on facebook in spare time, I can safely say 3G with this phone is another strong point.Now my main problem with the other phone, reception.... I get six bars constantly with Virgin Mobile, I never have trouble calling people or sending/receiving texts.I'm not a big camera user, but when I do take a picture the flash is a tad to bright at times. Other than that I see no issue.Ive always had physical keyboards, so the switch to a touchscreen was difficult, but you'll get use to it after a couple days.All in all, for $200 this cannot be beat, you get better service than other pre-paid providers, and you get a better phone than what other providers give you. Its a win-win.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Definitely an Upgrade!", "Author": "iheartwaterbottles", "ReviewID": "RJMSTGOHFL5LC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought and received this phone three days ago as an upgrade from an engineering version of the very first droid (running eclair) and I have to say I am very happy with my choice.POSITIVES:Ice Cream Sandwich is a great version of android, and it runs really nicely on this phone. There are literally no apps I've run into that I cant download, so that's a plus (coming from eclair especially!)The phone itself is a really great design - extremely slim with nothing sticking out except the chin piece, which is actually a great addition as it allows you to have a better grip on your phone. This phone is honestly as beautiful as the iphone (I absolutely love apple products, so that's saying a lot).The keyboard is FANTASTIC. I had such trouble with my old phone's keyboard - after 4 months of use I still was messing up letters. This one I got within the first five minutes of use!This phone also has five customizable home screens, which is honestly the perfect amount. With any more, I think I would be overwhelmed.I really enjoy that android has the option to put widgets on the homescreens, whereas apple does not have that feature on their iphone.As far as price goes, this was an incredibly great phone for the money.I'm extremely pleased!NEGATIVES:You can't get to the battery yourself, so that's kind of annoying. No replacing it yourself when the time comes.I wish there was a dedicated camera button on the side of the phone, but that's not a huge deal as the lack of it adds to the overall flow of the phone design.I also wish there was a front camera to skype with, but it's not a huge deal. If you really want that, you can pay $100 extra and get the Evo V. But the lack of that feature wasn't worth the strain on my wallet!The one thing that I have noticed is that the screen does lag when you're opening and navigating through apps, especially when you have lots open. But that's to be expected, as its processor and RAM aren't the best on the market. With that said, you just need a little patience and you'll be fine.CONCLUSION:I did a lot of research before I bought this phone, especially between this phone and the HTC Evo V. For $100 less, I got a phone that I'm extremely pleased with and will definitely be keeping around!While I would have bought the iPhone had it not been out of price range, I honestly am so pleased with this phone that even if I have the opportunity to purchase the iphone in the next couple years, I honestly don't know that i would because this phone is so great.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "The One V gives you only the features you need and doesn't make you pay for the ones you don't", "Author": "T. Kocanda", "ReviewID": "R1CU1ZUIKMBC87", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just for a bit of perspective, I've owned and used nothing but an iPhone (3G, 4, 4S) for my last few contract cycles; and they were great phones... but so is the HTC One V; and for 1/3 the cost.Chances are if you're looking into purchasing this phone (or any new cell phone), it's not because of your need to change handsets, but your need/want to change CARRIERS. I feel for you; but as this is a review of the phone itself, I'll attempt to leave any carrier/service references to a minimum.Two things caught my attention about the One V right off the bat: 1. Unlike most other Android phones it is not a 30lb death-brick that you must lug around in your pocket (forcing you to tighten your belt just keep your pants up), and 2. for what you get, the price is very very good.The One-Series by HTC is their current \"in\" thing; and the One V is basically the little brother to the other phones in that series. With that being said, it has a few surprises up its sleave. The build quality of One V is extremely good. The back of the phone and the lower portion of the phone's front are actually metal, not plastic; this creates a phone surface that is very resistant to scratches, dings, and damage all-together. And the screen, from what I've read, is that new-fangled Gorilla Glass; or something similar and just as durable. All-in-all the phone's exterior is above-average for handsets in this price range.Internally, too, it doesn't disappoint. The on-board Android version is 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), and the phone's processor handles it quite well. The UI that comes standard is a dialed-back version of HTC Sense; a few less fancy animations and 5 (rather than 7) Home Screens for you to customize. This version of HTC Sense may seem less flashy, but keeps the phone running smoothly without issue.And that, actually, transitions nicely into the only significant drawback to the One V: the processor power. The One V has a rather low-key processor; something in the area of a single-core 1GHz model. It gets the job done, but noticably struggles sometimes with the more-demanding apps.The bottom line here is that the One V is a solidly-built phone for the everyday user. It lacks some of the \"bells and whistles\" that some power-users may desire, but this phone was not built for insane X-Box style graphics running simultaneously with 5 open internet sessions of Facebook full-site version. It is first-and-foremost a communication, internet, and audio-centered handset (Beats Audio, IMAP and Exchange mail built-in, good reception, etc.). And paired with Virgin's Unlimited Data and Unlimited Text plans, it becomes a very powerful tool for the everyday user; a tool that, because of the hardware quality, will last that user a very long time.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best virgin mobile phone for the money", "Author": "M.

I hope Virgin gets the S3 in the next few months so I can switch to something better.Update: 11/23/2012About two weeks ago, a software push fixed the battery indicator issue. I wanted to test it out to be sure, but the battery indicator does charge fully now and gives an accurate read.---------------------------------------------------------------------My wife and I both bought this phone with Virgin Mobile. We had HTV Evo's before this and loved them. Obviously, the One V isn't as powerful, but we were ok with that for the money saved on the phone plan.Pros:-The Price-The phone is easy to use, its a fairly standard Android set up.-The phone calls have all been clear and everyone says they can hear me great.-The beats audio makes for some crisp audio coming from the phone.But there have been several issues both my wife and I experienced.-After a few days the battery would only appear to charge to 67% and would say \"Discharging\" for the status. We found that we still get about a full days worth of battery life (about 7-9 hours). If you restore the phone to factory defaults, it'll work for another few days and do the same thing.I've read about this happening to other Android phones and tablets and all have been fixed with software updates.-Apps will seemingly uninstall themselves. This usually happens after rebooting the phone. The shortcut still appears on the screen, but the application is completely gone. You have to go to the Google Play store and re-download them.-The keyboard can be terrible. It's sluggish and will often freeze for a few seconds at a time. It also seems to be out of calibration a lot. I'm constantly having to re-calibrate.-The predicative text is also terrible. Certain words really annoy me, like when you're trying to type \"and\" and mess up, the phone autocorrects to \"AMD.\" I can't imagine more people are talking about processors than using the most used conjunction. I ended up turning this off.-Even with Wifi enabled, browsing the internet can be a bit slow. Things like YouTube buffer every 5 or so seconds.-The phone gets fairly hot after about 5-10 minutes of use.Overall this is a great bargain phone and most of the issues I have can probably be fixed with software updates.

I'm very familiar with Android since I've had a Samsung Epic 4G on Sprint for 2 years, yet I can't help but like the HTC Sense interface as well as the Android 4.0 operating system, known as Ice Cream Sandwich, which is intuitive and easy to use. It's also very quick and snappy with the 1 GHz CPU. As for the physical quality, I love the aluminum unibody design. It feels sturdy and high quality. The texture isn't too slippery and I'll be trying out a couple of cases to see how they feel. The screen is nice and bright and looks very crisp.The main gripe I have with the phone is that it was designed with a sealed battery, meaning it's not meant to be user replaceable. It is possible to replace it with a little bit of work, but if I wasn't familiar with opening electronics and soldering I'd be out of luck. It's easy enough to remove the bottom cover to access the microSD port and the speaker, though. Another gripe I have, which I know can be fixed with some hacking (rooting, custom ROM, etc) is that the battery icon does not show numbers for the percentage of battery life remaining, it only shows the battery icon \"draining\" as the battery life decreases.Overall I'm very happy with the phone and I'm sure once my father adjusts to Android he will be happy with it too.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "best phone ive ever owned from virgin mobile", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "RMOTWIWZLLTNM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the android OS is great. super fast, and the battery in this thing is a TANK. compared to every other virgin mobile phone ive owned in the past this is the best one EVER. and thats coming from someone that changes phones like he changes underwear. BUY THIS PHONE", "Date": "August 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Two Stars out of the box, Five Stars after upgrades", "Author": "PowderedWaterToo", "ReviewID": "R233KQRFVBEV5B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "*** ORIGINALLY GAVE 2 STARS with title \"Two Stars = 'I don't like it,' and that's true\"; see UPDATE below ***I had the Optimus V for about a year, but had to buy a new phone because the pathetic internal memory caused the phone to reach a point of uselessness. I couldn't add any apps and reached a point where I couldn't even receive text messages.So I bought the HTC One V... (all comparisons below are to the Optimus)THE GOOD:-The internal storage is much better.  For a \"power user\", it might not be enough, though.  Don't be fooled by the \"4gb ROM\":  there are actually only 0.94GB of available space out the box.  Still, this is a major improvement over the Optimus. And of course, you can add up to 32GB of external storage.-Phone is thinner and sleeker looking, plus has a larger screen without being one of those huge tabletesque phones. Honestly, the Optimus just looks outdated next to this one-Improved camera with flash-Web browser with Flash and an option to force to desktop sites (as opposed to mobile version)-Web browser also has a \"Read\" option that makes articles much easier to read-Auto-brightness (which doesn't work that well, but is better than nothing)-Keyboard functionality (WHEN IT WORKS; see below)is greatly improved. I liked Swype in the Optimus, but more often than not it was just a pain in the ass. This phone does not have Swype; it has an advanced word recognition software that knows what you are trying to type.  So if you are a sloppy typer like me who usually has to hit backspace everyother character, those days are gone.  Just type away with your sloppy fingers and the phone will automatically insert the word that you meant to type, with amazing accuracy. Plus having a bigger screen and more widely spaced characters makes it easier to type accurately in the first place.-Phone automatically switches to speaker phone when you flip it overTHE BAD:-Now and then the phone will not rotate the screen when I rotate the phone.  Very annoying.  I will hold it there for a minute and eventually it will do it.  Doesn't happen all the time, but it shouldn't happen at all.-The status bar at the top of the screen is not always visible.  With the Optimus, it was always there.  With the HTC, when you are looking at web pages or using certain apps, they will take the whole screen and you will not see the status bar.  This might sound like a good thing, but trust me, it gets annoying.  What's the time?  If you want to know you have to go back to the home screen.  Want to check on that download? You gotta go back to the home screen.  You starting to get the picture???  (FIXED by downloading Dolphin web browser; SEE UPDATE BELOW)-Pandora has significant bugs with this phone. If you get a call, the music does not automatically resume after it (this is true with Amazon Cloud Player too). Also, if you go to a different app, you can't go back into it; it freezes then restarts when you try (doesn't  happen every time, but quite often).-If you want to have a screen lock (pattern, pin, or password), then you now have the extra step of swiping a ring then doing your security method.  Might not seem like a big deal, but having to do that extra step every time you enter your phone is enough to make you not even use a screen lock (I did on the Optimus; I am not with this phone because it is too much of a hassle)THE UNACCEPTABLE (both fixable; see UPDATE below):-There is a significant bug with the keyboard when using a web browser (I say \"a\", not \"the\" because I downloaded a new web browser, Dolphin, and had the same problem). The problem does not occur in apps or messaging, just web browsers. If you are writing something in the browser (I'm not talking about the URL bar) and you need to go back and delete a character, good luck! The cursor will show that it is on one letter, but it will begin erasing from a completely different spot.  For example, right now I am composing a message in Yahoo Mail.  I wrote \"unaccceptable.\"  Oops!  I wrote an extra c!  I better go back and delete that.  So I put the cursor between the c and the e.  I hit delete... what happens??? It erases the last e!  I hit delete again and it erases the l!  Yet, the whole time the cursor is blinking where I placed it!  If you are typing and hit delete without ever moving the cursor, there is no problem. But if you are typing a long comment or email or whatever and you need to go back and change something, 9 times out of 10 you will be SOL and become so frustrated you will be ready to stomp on your phone.-You know how I mentioned in the GOOD section how the phone features an intelligent auto-complete when typing???  Well sometimes  when you are writing in landscape view (i.e. with the phone sideways) the auto-complete bar hovers on top of the keyboard.  So it's right in the f***ing way when you are trying to type.  You are tying to type a letter and you can't avoid but to click on one of the word suggestions.  If you rotate the phone to portrait view (phone upright), this corrects the problem, but then you have to work with a much smaller keyboard arrangement.-(there was a problem where the battery would not fully charge, but HTC released an update for that)To be clear, these are not problems that I just happened to have on the phone I got.  I originally bought this phone from Amazon, but I ended up returning it because I figured there was a problem with my specific phone.  I bought another one directly from Virgin Mobile and have the same problems.The phone has memory, so it works, unlike the Optimus it replaced.  But these problems are just unacceptable for a new phone.  I truly believe that Virgin Mobile gets the crappy phones that the manufacturers know have problems and want to get rid of.  One hour of quality control would have caught these problems, but obviously that was not a concern.*** UPDATE (11/22/2012) ***The two \"Unacceptable\" problems are solved by installing a new keyboard and web browser.  I chose SwiftKey and Dolphin, respectively, which are superior to the stock options.  I won't review those apps here, but suffice it to say that they rock.If you install those two apps, this becomes a four star phone.I decided to keep pushing it.  I rooted the phone and installed Tasker and ROM Toolbox.  Again, I won't review these apps, but they make the phone one amazing piece of machinery.If you root the phone and install those two apps as well, this becomes a five star phone.That said, my review is for the HTC One V.  It is NOT for the HTC One V with a bunch of changes made to it so that it isn't a piece of crap.  My initial review was two stars.  Because of the ABILITY to make it an awesome phone, I moved it up to three stars.  To put it differently, you can't say \"Oh this car is perfect (five stars)... if you replace the engine and transmission.\"  You feel me?The phone is not as powerful as some other phones and is noticeably laggy.  But the price is right, and if you are willing to put in the time, it can be made into an amazing device.  After rooting the phone and installing a bunch of apps that make the phone function well, I am very happy with the product.***When signing up on Virgin Mobile, please use KickBack Code \"uYv674L0\" to get 60 free minutes bonus airtime!

For $199 this is truly a phone worth considering. Heres some of the specs:1 GHz Single Core Processor3.7 WVGA Super LCD, 800x480 DisplayBeats AudioAndroid 4.0.3/Ice Cream SandwichSense 45 MP Camera with LED FlashRecords in 720p HDDesign:The HTC One V is built out of a single piece of Aluminum which gives the phone a nice sturdy and durable feel. The phone also brings back the \"Chin\", which slightly raises the bottom of the phone. This is a love it or hate it. For me i love it, because it makes the phone unique and it makes it stand-out against the straight bar phones today. One thing you will notice instantly about the phone is how light and thin it is. Its just mind blowing.Camera:The Camera might not be the latest, but it still takes decent shots. The 5 MP camera is equiped with HTC's Image Sense Chip which helps takes images faster, and it does help alot. Indoor shots were a little grainy, but still were okay. Outdoor shots were great, although not as detailed, than the 8 MP cameras, colors were very bright, and overall nice. The camera also has continuous shooting, which lets you take a continuous range of pictures, and you decide which one is the best photo, and the phone will delete the rest, saving only the picture you took. I found that feature pretty fun to use. The camera also has a wide-range of modes like Low light, panorama, HDR, and more. The camera can also record in up to 720p HD, which looked fantastic. Videos were very crisp and detailed. Another thing i liked about the camera was that while your taking a video, you can also take pictures at the same time. Overall this camera has a lot of neat features that it brings to the table, from continous shooting, to the video recording this camera is marvelous.Performance:The phone comes equiped with a 1 GHz Single Core processor. Doing basic day-to-day tasks was smooth and fast, but going through the web, and playing heavy graphic apps tend to make the phone lag alot. At times i found the phone freezing. Basic web searches seemed to make the phone feel overwhelmed and stressed out. So if you don't use the web a whole lot or play heavy intensive apps, you should be fine.Screen:The screen is something you have to see to believe. The screen is absolutly fantastic. The screen is 3.7\" setting it above the the iphone 4 and 4s, and just a smidge below the iphone 5. So for those of you who think phones are getting too big these days, this could be the phone for you. The screen wasn't to large too hold in one hand, and i can touch all 4 corners of the screen using my thumb. Colors were vibrant and true-to-life, while text looked clear and sharp. Playing games and watching movies look great, and the viewing angles on this phone are spectacular.Software:The phone comes with Android 4.0 aka Ice Cream Sandwich. HTC also added Sense Version 4. This version of sense is less intrusive and demanding than the other sense versions, so thats good. You get a decent amount of wallpapers and widgets to add to your 5 only screens. With Android 4.0 you get some of googles products preloaded, which include google+, google search, and access to the google play store. Now for the bad news. If you were hoping that the HTC One V was going to get Jelly Bean, think again. HTC released a statement saying that the HTC One V will not get Jelly Bean due to the lack of required Ram to runJelly Bean. Although Ice Cream Sandwich is still kindv'e new, it would have been nice to get jelly bean on this phone.Conclusion:The HTC ONE V is nice mid-range handset packing in some nice treats and goodies which range from the Sharp screen, to the camera. Since its only $199 without contract this a great device for anybody who wants a phone with some nice specs but without the heavy price. However, the processor is very lag prone, there is no front facing camera, and you wont be getting jelly bean anytime soon. But if all it takes is a great design, awesome camera, and beautiful screen then the HTC One V is for you!Hope you Enjoyed this review of the HTC One V!", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sleek, responsive 3G Android no-contract phone with fantastic camera", "Author": "Andrea Polk", "ReviewID": "RUDK669P2XWAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to upgrade from my LG Optimus V, purchased a year and a half ago. I decided to purchase the HTC One V instead of the HTC EVO V 4G Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile) because I do not have 4G available in my area.  If I did, I'm still not sure I'd want to pay the extra for it, as the 3G on the HTC One V is quite quick!I bought a OtterBox 77-20718 Commuter Series Hybrid Case for HTC One V - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black to use with the phone and will be doing a separate review of it, but suffice to say it provides excellent protection for the phone with a few small issues that can be overlooked in order to get the phone protected.What do I like about the HTC One V?It's very lightweight, sleek in its design, super responsive with the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system and it has an excellent GPS.  The screen is bright - too bright for me on 100%, and the 5.0MP camera with zoom takes excellent photos even in low light thanks to the built-in flash.  It also takes great 720 HD video and you can snap up to 20 photos in succession while video recording! Very cool feature.Transferring contacts from your old phone to the HTC is super easy thanks to an icon on the phone that gives you the option to do it over Bluetooth.  I did it and after turning on the old phone and the new one, both with the Bluetooth on, the whole process took only a few minutes to transfer over 200 contacts.Watching YouTube videos over the 3G connection (Sprint network for Virgin Mobile) is great on this phone.  The LG Optimus V never did it for very long without bogging down, but the HTC One has the power to do it and quickly!Facebook and Twitter uploads of photos are also speedy with this phone.Call quality is excellent, and voice dialing a breeze.  Google searches via voice, and even emailing and texting via Google voice is great!The Beats audio is noticeable even with Skullcandy Titan In Ear Bud S2TTDZ-033 (Black/Black), but would be that much better with Beats by Dr. Dre Tour High-Resolution In-Ear Headphones from Monster or another Beats product.  I enjoy both my own music on a microSD card (not included) and TuneIn Radio on this phone.I appreciate the features of this phone at the low price point and no-contract.  I use the Beyond Talk $35 plan (I had the $25 plan, but they wouldn't allow me to keep it when I changed phones...) and have 300 minutes, and unlimited text and data.  An outstanding value that can be truly appreciated with the speed of the HTC One V.What don't I like about the HTC One V?Not crazy about the battery life.  I'm sure that once I figure out how to turn things off to conserve it, that will help.  For now it's about 4 hours with heavy video, Facebook and music useage.  About 10 hours on standby.  The manual says to charge the phone when not using it, indicating you don't need to wait for a full discharge of the battery.  Time will tell if that's a good or bad thing.I wish it had more internal memory.  You can add up to 32GB on a microSD card, which can hold videos, music and photos, but large apps won't necessarily work on this phone.  You may find you need to get rid of some to add others.The HTC One V is a definite step up from the LG Optimus line.  I think the operating system is the main reason, but perks like the 5.0MP camera with a flash, HD video, superior GPS and Beats audio for the same money as the LG Optimus Elite Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile) make this a 9 out of 10 in my book, even with the lack of internal memory and battery life.No, it's not an iPhone, nor is it 4G, but if you're paying $35-$55 on the Beyond Talk plan for Virgin Mobile and not under contract - this is a sweet phone and in my opinion, the best of their current sub-$200 phone offerings.As an added perk to this phone, you get 23GB of FREE Dropbox space for 2 years with this purchase.  Nice for storing video, photos and large attachment files from emails.Free Apps you might enjoy:  Scanner Radio, Zedge (wallpapers and ringtones for free...), Pinterest, Amazon Price Check, Gemini App Manager, App2SD (send apps to your storage card versus leaving on internal memory...), and Cozi Family Organizer.Don't hesitate to get this one if you want to enjoy Facebook, YouTube videos, taking great photos and video, GPS navigation, and enjoying your music, as well as making and receiving clear calls on the Virgin Mobile (Sprint) network.UPDATE: 9/11/12The camera on this thing rocks!  Lots of tweaks possible with panorama, portrait, HDR, group portrait, whiteboard, landscape, close-up (macro), low light and auto. You can also turn off the flash or put it on automatic.  It has a self-timer, you can change the ISO, make exposure, contrast, saturation, and sharpness adjustments. You can change the white balance to incandescent, flurescent, daylight, cloudy, and geo-tag photos.  It has an auto face and smile capture detection, and an auto upload feature. Continuous shooting is very cool, with up to 20 frames in a row possible.  You have up to 1080x720 HD video quality possible with the camera in this phone!  That alone makes it for me. You can adjust the image resolution downward from 5MP (2592 x 1552), but why?!Awesome camera!  So much more than expected.  I love it.  Boosting the review from 4 to 5 stars.  This phone has it all and does it very well for less.UPDATE: 9/25/12The initial poor battery life has been replaced with AMAZING battery life.  What happened?  I took the advice of another reviewer and let the battery completely deplete itself with normal use - YouTube, Facebook, photo and video taking, texting, GPS use and calling, and then fully recharged it.The phone learns your useage patterns and optimizes the battery accordingly.  I couldn't believe I still had juice in this thing after five days!  I'm not a power-user, but with the LG Optimus V I was lucky to get 1 days worth of use before a much needed charge.Kudos to HTC on this beautifully functioning Android phone!UPDATE: 7/8/13Virgin Mobile added Virgin Mobile - Apple Iphone 4s 16gb Memory No-contract Mobile Phone - White to their line up a month or two ago, so I switched my service from the HTC One V to the iPhone.  There's a noticeable boost in performance; even using the same 3G network, but I'm keeping the One in reserve.

It was the perfect phone for what I want (note: want, not need) but it carried a $300 price tag.Another phone I considered is the LG Optimus Elite. That is a perfect phone for what I need and only carried a $120 price tag.Comparing them, and also looking at this phone, I get a good compromise at a compromised price.Also factoring in is the fact that I was buying multiple phones for my family and I ended up buying the LG Optimus Elite as well (so you can check that review too). The last factor was a sale where this phone was $150 instead of the standard $200.So what do I think of this phone?It is really nice. I am extremely happy with it.The screen is excellent. Seriously excellent. Bright and deep colors, and a clean resolution that makes using it so much better.One reason I opted for this phone is Ice Cream Sandwich. Is this version of the OS so much better than previous ones? No. But it does have some really nice features such as being able to combine items into folders.The phone is quick and responsive, and I never seem to have any issues or lag with it.Battery life seems mediocre. Not bad, not good. What I would expect from any smart phone. I make sure to use a task manager app to kill anything I am not using to extend the power.I seem to be able to get a day's use on a charge with no heavy usage.There are two physical features of the phone I really was leery of before buying.One is the obvious slant at the bottom of the phone. Style wise I didn't really like it but was more concerned with how it will fit in my pocket etc...In reality, the slant doesn't bother me one bit. Sure, I wouldn't have designed it that way myself, but it doesn't get in the way or annoy me.The other thing is that the screen of this phone is slightly raised from the body.I really didn't like that at all and thought it would collect a lot of lint and dust on the edges. This also doesn't really bother me. My case covers the left and right sides so it isn't an issue, and the top doesn't collect anything at all. The bottom does a bit, just because of the slant of the phone, but it isn't bad and in using the phone I don't even notice the screen is raised. So my two biggest hesitations are not really issues at all.End result: This is an excellent mid-range phone these days. It has nice, strong specs, but nothing so super that it blows other phones away.

If you are, you are looking at the wrong phone.However, if you are looking for a great looking, well built, entry level Android Smart Phone, you have come to the right place.I am not going to review the Virgin Mobile service because all Virgin Mobile phones have the same strengths (inexpensive no contract service plans) and weaknesses (Slow 3G data rates, spotty coverage, No 4G LTE).The phone runs on the Sprint Network, so you should check out your Sprint Coverage before hooking up to Virgin Mobile.It should be noted, that this phone does not have a SIM card, so this phone can not be transferred to any other service.  You're stuck with VM.Now on to the phone.The phone is well built with it's aluminum unibody and Gorilla Glass screen and fits well in your hand.  The 3.7 inch display, while not Super AMOLED is still very sharp, has adequate brightness and a very wide viewing angle.The phone is powered by a 1Ghz Single Core Snapdragon processor with 512MB RAM and 4GB internal storage (1GB available for apps) and supports adding up to 32GB of storage via it's built in Micro SD slot.  It is currently running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich with HTC's \"Sense 4.0\" UI enhancement suite (more on that later....).The built in 5MP camera has all the bells and whistles of more expensive smart phones, including HDR processing, Panoramic View, Burst Mode, and the ability to take stills while recording from Video.  In fact, the camera is one of the strongest features of this phone, and I am constantly amazed at the quality of the shots I get from this little powerhouse.  Missing in action is a front facing camera so no Video Chat or Face Unlock features on other handsets running ICS.The phone also features \"Beats Audio\" on board which helps make music sound richer when listening on headphones.  Beats Audio is a bit of a gimmick, and in my opinion isn't anything but a pre-amp with added Bass, but it does improve the sound quality while on vs while off.Call quality is fine and I have never had issues with any dropped calls in my service area.The battery life is good compared to similar Android Smartphones, but it's lack of a user replaceable battery will encourage you to buy a car charger or be close to an available USB port if you will be away from AC power for more than a day at a time.  Apps like Juice Defender Plus or Ultimate available on Google Play can help extend your battery life significantly.The snapdragon processor is adequate for ensuring a mostly smooth UI motion and the ability to run almost any app available on Google Play.  Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, Words with Friends....All run with no issue.  Some intensive apps like Temple Run will cause the phone to hiccup, so this phone by no means is a \"gamer\".A lot of people have complained that this phone is rather \"slow\".  And I too, have noticed slowdowns on this handset, mainly when loading webpages.  Upon further investigation, I believe this has more to do with it's limited RAM more than it's processor.HTC loads it's \"Sense\" suite of UI enhancements, and does improve a bit on the stock ICS experience, however it comes at a cost.  Sense takes easily 30 to 50 MB of available memory and there is no way to turn it off.  Add this to the overhead in running ICS, and your phone is easily down to less than 100MB of RAM available to run apps.  As a result, you can get to low memory conditions rather quickly.The only way around this is to Root the phone and load one of the many custom ICS ROM's available which do not include HTC sense.  The downside to this, however, is Rooting the phone will void it's warranty (you have to unlock the phone from HTCDev website, so you can't root it without HTC knowing about it).  And since Sense UI also controls the Camera App, you are likely to eliminate a lot of the cool features of the camera as well.For a majority of us non power users, Rooting the phone, trying to flash custom ROMS is not a viable option.  A much better alternative for me, is an application called Auto Memory Manager available from Google Play.  It has two built in settings which unlike other \"task killers\" allows you to set memory thresholds after which Android will start killing certain classes of services.  These settings are fully user configurable so you can experiment to see which values work best for you.  This has really helped eliminate most of the annoying lag I have experienced thus far.  And if I am careful not to go to overly complex websites via the browser, I can eliminate the lag almost completelyIt is important, however, to keep in mind, this is an entry level phone and it will never approach the performance of a phone 4 to 5 times it's cost.  It is a very nice Entry Level Android Smart phone, and as long as you keep in mind it's limitations, you will be able to do almost everything your friends with their much more expensive handsets can do with their phones, just not quite as fast.However, with plans starting at $35/dollars a month for 300 anytime minutes and unlimited text and web, you won't be paying nearly as much as they did either.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for a Prepaid Phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RVLS7TASUJ474", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In June, I saw the EVO V for V-Mo, and snatched it right up, but had a lot of network problems and had to return it. I got the One V instead, and still have some network problems, but not as many. I have no idea what the problem is - it's not my local tower, because my old Optimus works just fine, plus I traveled with the EVO to Cincy, Portland, and Atlanta and experienced the same issues.But anyway, that is an issue with me personally. The One V itself is a great phone, probably the best available for a pre-paid carrier except maybe the Evo or iPhone (but who wants to pay that much)?I've had it since July and I am pleased with it overall. The OS lags every once in a while when switching between apps and things like that, but it's not so bad that it becomes a point of annoyance. I paid $199 for it, and feel that I've gotten my money's worth, so $69 today is a total steal. If you're looking to move to prepaid, or are already on V-Mo and want an upgrade, do it. After having this phone for several months, I would have no reservations buying it again, especially at that price.The overall performance on this phone is okay - I wouldn't necessarily say it is any better or worse than any other phone out there as far as Wifi/3G connectivity are concerned. The Bluetooth works well. The Beats Audio is something I haven't found to make much difference other than boosting the volume.One of the best things about this phone is the battery performance. I don't even have a battery-saving app on my phone, and I can get by sometimes only having to charge it every other day.This phone is pretty good overall, and if you are looking for something with decent specs but don't care if it's the latest and greatest, and are looking to get out of a contract, this phone is your best option.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect first smartphone for a newbie like me", "Author": "Marc Strand", "ReviewID": "R4A2SQQ3PZXOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I knew I wanted to get away from the Verizon contract world, and since my son has had good luck with Virgin Mobile, the only question I had to answer was, which phone?

It's much thinner and lighter than the Evo V. 4G is not available in my area, like many people, so the lack of it doesn't affect me. I love the metallic feel. It's smooth and seems stronger/more durable than the plastic on most phones. The VM logo is located on the back of the device (on a removable piece) which is great.The camera takes decent pictures and the flash option is great. Taking pictures while recording a video is awesome too and not something I;ve seen on a phone before.I enjoy how the LED notification light is on the edge of the phone and is visbile whether phone is laid on it's front or back.The speaker sounds much better/louder than the Evo V and you can tell a difference when listening to headphones with Beats audio enhancer on, but it's nothing too special.The ICS (Android 4.0) software is great and just better in almost everyway to the previous versions I've tried. HTC Sense looks beautiful and has no noticeable lag. I've never had any serious freeze or lags, but running several intensive apps simueltaneously can slow things down a tad.

She also wanted a smaller one than the one I have (HTC EVO V). This model wasn't available when I got mine, and honestly- despite the fact that it's a lower end device- I like it more than the EVO.First off, this device is considerably lighter and more compact than the EVO, and I like the angled bottom. It makes it easier to hold, and despite its slender form it still has a solid feel.It has a 5 MP camera which is essentially the same as one of the two cameras on the EVO V. To be honest, I've hardly used the 3D picture feature on my EVO so for all intents and purposes this is the same thing. The camera is also flush with the back, not jutting out.Performance is good, and while it has only 512 MB of RAM it's really good enough for anything except maybe some 3D games. If you care about such things, then yeah- get an iPhone, EVO, or Galaxy. If not, this is really quite good enough. The device has most standard features: bluetooth, micro-SD slot, GPS, etc.The device runs Android 4.0 ICS and is generally very responsive. The screen is very bright and clear, and although it's not exactly a retina display it's fine for general tasks like browsing and email.The micro-SD slot isn't externally located, but it's the next best thing. You pop off the bottom panel where the antenna is, and there it is. No need to power it off, pry off the whole back panel, and take out the battery. Internal memory has about 1 GB free.Oh, and on a sidenote, it is a 3G device- not 4G. However, I've found that 4G coverage is so bad in my area that it really makes no difference. If 4G is a selling point for you, you should definitely check the service map before you decide on anything.In short, although it isn't the powerhouse that the EVO V is, I actually wish I'd gotten this one instead.

I needed to be able to make important phone calls and stay in touch with friends, so I needed a phone with a \"plan\" that would give me unlimited minutes at a reasonable price, since I'm on a tight budget. I know most people buy smartphones for their internet, photo, and other capabilities, and I enjoy those features too. But the main thing I needed with this phone was unlimited minutes and good quality calls with strong reception. I can say that after nearly a month with the phone, I am very satisfied with the quality of the calls I've made. I'm in Charleston, SC, which is certainly not a bustling metropolis like New York or L.A. Once I get about 20 miles outside of the city, reception can be spotty at times, but where I live the reception is great. My brother has a Virgin mobile device that he uses in the Boston area, and he says he's never run into any issues with reception. As far as the One V phone itself is concerned, it feels like a quality device. The weight of it seems just right, and the construction feels strong. I've barely read the manual, and have been able to figure out mostly everything on my own up to this point, so it is definitely user friendly. Some people have made comments previously about calls or texts not going through while the wifi is enabled. I haven't encountered that problem, though I've only sent a few texts and made a few calls while it was turned on. I usually turn it off to conserve power. Which brings me to battery life. Again, this is something that has been discussed quite a bit by others, so I won't go too in depth. However, I read someones comment about the phone \"figuring out\" what your trends for usage are like, and adapting to it over time to optimize battery life. I thought this seemed like a bit of a stretch, but after a few weeks of use, it became apparent that the phone had definitely figured me out so to say. When I went to charge my phone the other day, I checked the battery usage stats, and it had been well over 4 days on the battery since the previous charge! I turn my phone off at night, so that's 6-8 hours a day that it's not on. But still, the battery life is actually quite good, and for people that use the phone more heavily than I, you should be able to make it through a full day without the battery dying. Overall, this phone is a great device and is fun to use. I don't see why the majority of people would \"need\" more than what this phone offers as far as performance and capabilities. The next HTC model up is almost another $100, and I can't image it's much (if at all) better.

I truthfully never used enough data or minutes to justify paying what I was through ATT. So now that there are a couple pay as you go or pre-paid options, I thought I would try to save a ton of money and give Android a go. I did originally order the iphone 4S through Virgin,  but I returned it and decided to holdout until the iphone 5 is available, which I'm sure will happen in the future. Until then I though I would tryout android and decided to go cheap but also found the HTC EVO ONE V to have great reviews.The HTC EVO ONE is a good android phone for the price and has many options of many higher priced smartphones. Coming from the IOS to Android they are many things I had to adjust to. Although, it hasn't taken me much time to figure out the ins and outs of android. There are some things that I'm still learning and perfecting as I go. This phone will need a MicroSD card if you plan on using any kind of storage. It only comes with .94gb of on board storage which is enough for a decent amount of apps but not for music, pictures, etc. I would recommend investing in a 32gb sdcard which you can find online for around $20. After its formatted it leaves with right around 30gbs of external storage.The integration of Google is a plus with this phone. I feel so updated with everything google, twitter, instagram that I almost never feel the need to get on my computer to check these things. I dont have facebook so I have no way of knowing how it plays with the HTC? The screen is close to if not the same size as the iphones, but it doesn't seem to be as responsive as the Iphones. I also had to locate a different keyboard through the play store. The one that comes with the HTC is almost maddening at times,.Especially if you have fat thumbs like myself.  The HTC feels good in the hand and since its such a cheap phone (price wise) I don't feel like I have to worry so much about if I drop it or break it. Since i could easily buy 4-7 of these before I would come up to the price of a Iphone 4S or 5. I have yet to put music on the phone because my library is currently on itunes and is huge. I have read there are many options such as the isyncr app, but I have yet to venture there.  Overall this is a great phone to try out android a go. It has many features of the big guys but it does lack some features some might find they can't live without. All and all you can save a lot of money with this phone in the long run and could easily use that saved money to buy a better phone in the future. I think this phone is smart but not brilliant. It gives you the freedom of Android and if you're a Apple fan who may be bored with IOS or just want to try something different this is a nice gateway. I also think many phone companies will start to offer unsubsidized phones in the future which may come with a cheaper plan, but that's yet to be seen. Not being stuck in a two year contract and being able to save a lot of money in the long run seem like a no brainer to me. Especially when you can do this on the same networks as T-Mobile with Virgin Mobile and Sprint with Cricket. Verizon and ATT may have the best network coverage all around but if you don't travel a lot many times the little guys will suffice in your area.

I've had this phone for only 4 months and it's so slow. I've even reset it back to factory condition just to clear everything but that didn't help. The biggest issue I have that makes me hate this phone is text messages. When you have the \"all messages\" list open and try to tap on one conversation, it'll start to open that conversation then go right back to the \"all messages\" list. It does it a few times before finally opening one conversation. It even does it if there's just one conversation on the list. I even check the \"running applications\" list constantly to see if there's something still running that's slowing things down but there's never anything running that shouldn't be.

You can check on your phone how many minutes or data you have used or you can go to their website an log on - that's awesome!Now the phone - HTC One V -  It's slim, built in battery so you can not use a spare!  touch screen is very responsive.  The screens and options to customize are great.  It's much easier in the pocket and carrying around than the HTC 4G or any of the other 'brick' sized phones out there.  The screen is just big enough to watch youtube and view facebook etc.  It's only 3G which is fine with me, atleast you're not paying for something you can hardly get.  It runs off my wi-fi at home or any other free wi-fi it picks up on (saves on battery).  I have used the GPS and its worked great!  You get Google Maps/Nav and you get the Sprint Nav.  I prefer Google.  Battery drainage has been fantastic!  48 hours with minimal use (couple of 10 minute calls, texting, facebook, check emails etc)....48 hours is awesome!  I have read about complaints that when charging it will not charge over 78% or some other percentage. That happened to me but it's fixed now. You charge the phone while it's switched off!  Only for the first few times.  Let the phone run down to about 20%, then switch off, charge and wait for the green light.  Voila!  If I charge while it's on it still sometimes stuck around the 70 or 80% but when I unplug the charger and put it back in - it says 100%.  So it is and will charge all the way.  No big problem.  But if you want to charge while it's off it should show the green light when it's done and when you switch it on it'll show 100%.I have downloaded 2 battery and app killer apps.  'easy task killer' it's called.  Excellent app.  Kills unwanted apps and reduces battery useage.  This app will show you the percentage of battery charge left and were all the charge as been used, it breaks it down for you  EG  15% on standby, 15% on calls, 5% web, 65% charge remaining.  Cool!  You can also customize the settings so for example it will not 'refresh' emails, facebook notifications, etc etc... and this will also save battery juice!  So if your battery is low and your out somewhere you can atleast change the settings to preserve your battery until you can next charge it up.So from $79.99/mth (450 min and unlimited data) to $37/mth ($35 plus taxes) (300 min and unlimited data) and I now have a more reliable phone and an extra $40/mth in my pocket .

I couldn't turn it back on, it wouldn't respond to a hard reset, nothing. I called HTC to first troubleshoot, and then to try to get my money back, but they refused, and instead insisted that I send the phone into their facility to have it repaired since I was still under warranty. I paid to ship it to them, and they returned it in around a week and a half. The phone seems to be working all right thus far, however, something was not put back together properly because when I tilt the device, something inside it slides around as if it was not secured properly inside it. There is also now a small gap where the bottom of the screen fits in with the frame of the phone and the lights on the inside of the phone can be seen.I knew when I ordered this phone I wasn't going to be receiving the top of the line model of smart phones -- I was perfectly okay with that.

I picked this up as a deal of the day, and am currently using it as a mp3 player (not activated), and so far, so good!  The phone feels to be of solid construction, to the point where I don't feel the need to use a screen protector or case, for now anyway.  The size is convenient, I actually prefer this size to larger 4-5\" phones.  The screen is clear and crisp, with good touch interface.  Sound and camera are both ok; could be better, but certainly functional.  My previous android mp3 player was a Samsung Galaxy player 4.0 (it got rained on, and have had battery issues since...).  I find this phone to be better in almost all aspects; price, screen, newer OS, camera, sound, the option to use as a phone, if needed.  About the only thing that would go in the galaxy player's favour would be that it has a replacable battery (which unfortunately didn't help my battery drain problems).  Both devices have good wifi, and GPS capability. Even at full retail price, I would recommend this phone over a galaxy player; especially because of the updated OS.To sum up, this is an excellent smartphone for it's class.  It's solid, functonal, and has relatively current software.  However, if you're looking to do  a lot of multitasking , heavy mobile gaming, or need the sleekest, meanest thing out there, this is not the phone for you.  It's processor and RAM won't be able to keep up, and it's not quite as refined as other, pricier optons.  But, for me, it is a viable alternative to any other smartphone /mp3 player out there, with the added bonus that it makes for a great entry  phone, too.As a side note, I have been a Sprint customer, and found their network to be OK.

Setup on the Virgin Mobile web site was easy, although I winced at having to sacrifice the unused minutes from my previous Virgin Mobile plan! I got the $35/mo 300-min talk/unlimited streaming and that's a real bargain.Customizing the phone with look-and-feel, apps and widgets was straightforward. This phone is not the fastest out there, in terms of both processing and network access, but it's plenty quick enough for my needs. I can stream music and videos just fine over G3, and of course I use wifi at home.Voice quality is good. I get great reception in my area - will have to try it on a trip before I can comment on breadth of coverage.One feature was a pleasant surprise - the font size can be adjusted such that I don't need my glasses to dial etc. This is the first mobile I've owned where that's true! The only downsides I found:- A serious glitch setting up my email: the incoming/outgoing mail server names automatically populated during setup were incorrect. I had to diagnose the problem (medium difficulty) research the right names (hard) and enter them (easy).- Problem pairing the phone to my Alpatronix X-tra Strong Bluetooth Portable Mini Capsule Speaker. The phone just refused to \"see\" the phone thru BT. A search on Google yielded a suggestion that the wifi was interfering with BT because it's on the same chip, and turning off the wifi would solve the pairing problem. That seemed like crazy talk to me, but was so easy to try that I did so - and it worked! Once I used a G3 stream to pair for the first time, the phone continues to recognize the speaker on G3 or wifi. This might help if you're having trouble pairing your own BT device.- Last problem is a global one, affecting all of us in the digital world - the Balkanization of content. Each hardware manufacturer tries to drive you to its own content and that of its partners, in part by making it hard to access other content, in part by making it hard to get their content on other manufacturers' devices.

The battery life is also not as great as it could be. I'm not someone who uses my phone constantly, but frequently, and it would die within a few hours. So if you decide to get this phone keep the apps to the very minimum, always have a charger with you, and expect to be told by people that they tried to contact you and you never responded.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible phone, slow processor, frustrating", "Author": "V.

The phone is aging, and like any technology in the 21st century, it is slowly becoming irrelevant. There is an emphasis on slowly, though, because it is only one Android OS back of the leader as of 16June2013. This phone is a good step up from basic Virgin Mobile phones, having a decent-sized CPU and beautiful camera. The thin profile makes this phone extremely portable, but it does make my hand cramp when texting/gaming for any time over ten minutes. The capacitative touch screen is a nice touch for those of you who are wary of virtual keyboards, and my sweaty hands never interfere with the smooth operation of each application and screen. I always ran into trouble with the iPod devices that use heat signatures from fingers, as the scroll would jump around from sweaty hands. Like I said, that is not the case here. The only con keeping this device from being a five-star is the antenna location and reception issues. All too often I see my bar strength spiking two or three bars in either direction, making conversation and data tranception lag or cut out. The antenna is in the the back cover, which is almost always covered by the hand through normal operation of the phone. This was especially bad when playing music over Bluetooth and texting somebody; the transmission would break up or cut out every single time my finger touched to back bottom of the case.

Prepaid phone offerings have often been the red-headed step children which the manufacturer could never find a market for, but the landscape has improved and this phone is evidence of that. It runs Ice Cream Sandwich, has plenty of processing power, and has exhibited almost no flaws in operation. The only consistent glitch has been with the \"Sense\" input; this being when you utilize the phone sideways to get the larger keypad.

With that fact in mind, I have to say that I LOVE this phone, but my 4-star rating takes into account the potential that it is currently selling for a much higher price (almost 3x) what I paid. While it is not as fast or reliable as most of the smart phones in the $300-400 range, it does the job fairly consistently. My only complaint would be that battery life really starts to wear out after about 6 months, but I've found that to be standard  across devices. Speaking only for the product and not Virgin Mobile service (which I have personally been quite pleased with), I think it is a good phone, fairly sturdy, sleek and light without feeling like it will break at the slightest drop (I have dropped it many times and have had no issues so far*); sound and connection is always clear, and with the Beats audio feature, the quality of sound whether through headphones or the built-in speakers is pretty high for a phone of this price range.

No plastic, just titanium I believe. So its very sturdy, I've dropped this phone down wooden stairs way too many times...Not one scratch on screen or body. The camera is pretty amazing for a phone. The pics are super crisp and clear, indoors/outdoors, the video quality is awesome, it could catch a cat zipping past ya with no blur. You can also take still pictures while recording..nice. It holds a charge really well, this phone can last well over a day.. 2% battery left? no problemo, you'll be fine for a few more hours. Now lets get to the bad: Texting, oh man... when someone sends you a text , it takes about 3-4 tries before youre able to open the message. It literally opens for .0001 seconds and go backs to your inbox marked unread. Imagine having to go through that a few times while in a quick texting conversation. Voice call speaker is cool but Music speaker volume is no good. How is that even possible? same speaker outlet... me no understand. This phone will lag viciously, and the home button deems unresponsive , pressing the home button during this will freeze your phone for a few seconds, yay! Things will continue to force close out of no where, and it gets super annoying after a while, especially when the processor crashes or whatever. Alarms work when it wants to, so dont depend on it. last but not not least, theres no detachable battery.. if you drop ur phone in water good luck.. if your phone completely freeze up until the point where its draining the system, good luck, if your power button wears out and you need to restart your phone or simply shut it down..good fricken luck.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "HTC One V Prepaid Android phone", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R3SL5TAPIWV1YD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything works as presented.

My first smartphone was a Droid, and I really miss the keyboard, but those are pretty hard to find these days, so I've managed to adjust to the touch-screen typing, but it is still inferior to the Droid's qwerty.  However, that's not specific to this phone.  I don't get service as well as I used to, but that may be from switching networks.  On to the HTC One V:First of all, this phone is slow.  I often tap things and have to wait several seconds for anything to happen.  Or I'll keep tapping, thinking it didn't take (because sometimes it doesn't) and wind up going somewhere totally different than I intended because it is going but doesn't look like it.  So then I have take forever backing out to get to what I was going to do.  I use this phone to process credit cards with PayAnywhere for my business, and it is embarrassingly slow.  And I don't have all that many apps on here and try to make sure apps I'm not using are not running... but of course a lot of them come back when I reboot, which often.Battery life is okay if I don't use the GPS and stay in range.  If I'm in a basement where I have no reception, battery is gone within an hour.  And if I'm using the GPS in the car, I pretty much have to keep it connected to the car charger or it's dead by the time I get to where I'm going.  Sometimes when it's connected to the car charger, it warns me that the charger is supplying less juice than the phone is using... so even though it's being charged, it's still losing battery power.  And I can't carry a spare charged battery with me because you can't open this phone to remove/replace the battery.  And sometimes it randomly reboots when it's low on battery, especially if you're trying to charge it and use it, and having it be low on battery, rebooting randomly, and sometimes not wanting to come on when you are in the middle of nowhere and trying to use its GPS is not fun, especially because if the phone is dead, both my ability to use the GPS to find where I'm going and to call for help/directions are gone.The phone is irregular about notifying me of emails and social media messages, but I'm not sure if that is because of the phone or the apps.For some reason, you can use downloaded/custom songs for ringtones, but not for notifications.  This has always irked me.Sound volume doesn't get as loud as I would have expected for a phone that brags of its audio and is shaped to help project sound.But anyway, by far my least favorite part of the phone and that has me wanting to replace it is that it sometimes doesn't send or receive text messages and I don't know it.  I have to reboot often, as this sometimes pushes them through... but not always.  So I never know if people got my messages or not unless they reply... and sometimes they get their messages and I don't get the reply until I reboot a few hours or days later.  Very frustrating.  I use both the app it came with and Handcent SMS, same issue.  A cousin of mine has the same phone and has a different issue, she gets text messages RESENT from her phone at random times.Overall, I'm sad that this is the quality I get with a phone that is rated so well.

This phone has turned out to be a nightmare. First off, like another reviewer mentioned...the Alarm clock doesn't work!!..come on now! I returned one HTC one v thinking that it was a problem with the phone, but nope same thing with the second one. Supposedly HTC didn't make the phone so that you could rely on it to wake you up. The phone goes to sleep and doesn't wake up until YOU wake it up by hitting the power button in the morning. I have to carry an alarm clock around with me now..my 'dumbphone' was way more reliable than this piece.  Secondly, and this may be a virgin mobile thing, the phone will freeze up and time will pass while the time on the phone stays the same. I'll still be able to scroll around, but it's like it's lagging behind and can't process quickly at all. This phone worked great at first and then all the sudden it has come to a crawl as far as speed goes. Beware, this thing will leave you frustrated and disappointed if you decide to go for it.

Since it is my phone, I know how to handle it, but if I ever hand it over to a friend to send a text or look up directions, they throw their hands in the air and give up because it lags so much.I generally manage the lagging by making sure to close out programs that I am not using rather than letting them run in the background, and I restart the phone at least once a day to clear out the memory. This is something iPhone users are appalled that I put up with, but again, I paid very little for the phone, and my monthly phone bills are about a third what they pay.Lately, I've been having more problems with basic functions of the phone like making phone calls and sending text messages. I'll have to tap a contact's name two or three times before it'll actually make the call or take me to the texting screen.A friend of mine recently picked up a cheap LG Phone with a slower processor running an older version of Android, and I've found that his phone runs much more smoothly than mine.  I imagine this may be because his cheaper phone respects its limitations, whereas the HTC One V tries to do all of the things that a higher-end Android phone can do, but it just doesn't have the processing power or memory to handle it.Aside from that, I really like the styling and materials, I like that it fits more easily in my pocket than most current smart phones, and the screen is crisp and clear.

It's the same size as the Incredible, but with an angled \"chin.\" Visually, they look so similar that I can't help but compare them. Overall, I feel that this model is like the 3-4 year old Incredible, but one that has been stripped bare of certain features. If I was still using Verizon, I'd simply by a new battery and switch back to my old HTC Incredible. This phone feels intentionally hobbled by the manufacturer in order to justify the price point. I want to remain an HTC fan, but am finding it difficult.Pros:1) Small size fits easily in pocket2) The \"chin\" design gives the phone an asymetricality that makes the phone easy to orient (front/back/top/bottom) in the dark.3) Good camera (much improved)Cons:1) Missing the \"menu\" hardware button. Some apps are designed for a menu button, and not having one renders certain apps useless.2) Missing my favorite app--the HTC news RSS feed! HTC, you spent the hard work of creating the app, why would you purposely exclude it from later models?3) The alarm function is buggy--it only seems to buzz about 40% of the time. Ironically, if the phone is in deep sleep, it can't even wake itself up to wake me up! (I've had to buy an old fashioned alarm clock for my business trips! Are you kidding me?)4) The software regularly lags bigtime--even when using simple apps like text messaging. It often closes back to the home screen in the middle of typing.5) Battery held a charge well for the first 6 months, but I feel like it's quickly fading fast.

While it does that without too much of a fight, using as my daily phone has been quite a challenge. I for one am not a big fan of HTC Sense 4, and my battery life and data speeds were held back by the stock OS build (download speeds almost NEVER exceeded 300kbps even in a full coverage zone!). Thankfully, HTC makes it easy (and yes, it's legal) to unlock the bootloader and put a custom ROM onto the device. I traded the modest reliability of the stock build for much better battery life and data speeds that are much more useful (1.5mbps down).Overall, it has been an ongoing labor to try and make this phone fulfill my wants.

Calling for support, I was told to remove the battery and that it would need repair. When I received the phone back in the mail, there were no details about the repair and no instructions. Now, the phone had to be reactivated, but that process failed even though I tried numerous times. Unbeknownst to me, the motherboard was replaced in the phone and the device now had a new MEID/serial number, which was not in the . Six months later, the company still has not gotten around to putting that new number in their network database so that I can activate it.I wasted $300 on HTC for a phone that has no possibility of ever working again because of a technicality in their limited warranty repair service. HTC handed off this disaster to me with the claim that they took care of their responsibility to the buyer under warranty -- though, obviously their policy of repair with new MEID is responsible.This is not a one-time thing or a rant from me, one unsatisfied customer. Numerous of their CSRs have told me this is a very common problem they get phone calls about every day. They refuse to send me a phone which can be activated right away.Thus, I will never, ever buy another HTC phone (for instance, I had to buy yet another phone to be able to have service again and though an HTC phone was at a lower sales price, I chose to get a Samsung instead of throwing my money away with HTC).

This phone will never see an upgrade to Android 4.2 Jelly Bean (HTC has stated that any phone with 512MB ram or lower are not upgradable).  I for one will sign any petition other One V owners want to start up in order to get HTC to test an update for us.#2. No front forward facing 1.3MP VGA camera for Skype.#3. HTC killed animations for weather app and kept Sense gui light.#4  All aluminium case means when your phone finally does freeze up, you'll have to wait till the battery dies to restart.#5. Due to the charging port being on the lower left, had to buy a new car mount.Now the pros: Keep in mind, some of the above will be contradicted.#1. HTC Sense was kept light. I owned a HTC Hero, can you say bloated gui! Even if it is not as pretty, it's not slow!#2. Its made of aluminium, not plastic, so it feels tough and rugged.#3. Slim profile and screen is not to big. Phone is light!#4. Battery life is great.#5. In the one month I have owned this phone have only had Iheart radio force close once, phone never froze on me.The slim profile of the all aluminium body with its protruding chin make this a very comfortable phone as well as a sexy and sleek phone.It comes with a 1Ghz. single core processor and 512MB ram, along with 1Gb internal storage. Phone doesn't come with a MiniSD card, and due to its small internal storage I would recommend at least a 16GB card to purchase with it. It comes with Beats Audio which is definitely a plus.It's 3.7\" screen is bright and clear. A little small to type on screen with, but is fine when you type in landscape mode.The Camera on this phone despite only being 5MP is actually one of the better camera's I have used. It was kept simple and the gui kept light. It allows you to either hold your finger on the snap icon for burst shots or to snap a photo while video recording your sons little league baseball game.BlueTooth on this phone works good with my car and good with my computer. Although hotspotting is disabled, you can tether it to your computer with Klink or other such apps. As far as Sense being stripped down there were things I had to download and buy. HTC Evo V (My girlfriends phone) has quick settings on her shade that makes turning Mobile/WiFi/Bluetooth on and off easy. This phone didn't. Although unlike her phone the notifications shade drops at lock screen, so I purchased express settings and killed that little drawback.Phone runs Crackle and Netflix, although its better on WiFi for obvious reasons. Youtube is as good on any other phone and if your wondering if the single core and lack of ram will run GLWG or Angry Birds, Yes it will with no lag. Facebook comes pre-installed and runs better on this phone than on my last phone (Motorola Photon 4G 1.2Ghz dual core with 1GB ram) which was locked to Gingerbread 2.3 after Moto screwed their customers. Battery Life will depend on how hard you push it. Watching video or playing games will kill your battery in about 2.5 hours. I get roughly depending on if I remember to shut off mobile network in week signal area's and wifi when not home about 30 hours before having to charge it. but on a 10 hour shift at work left it on all knight with Iheart playing and went from 90% down to 37%. My old phone would have lasted about 4 hours!All in all if your looking for a good solid phone that will run like a trooper, look no further. It has embodied all that HTC stands for.

I've been using Verizon for over 4 years, but I decide to cancel them next month after the end of the contract because I believe it's too expensive.I don't talk much on the cell phone, so the 300 minutes for $35 a month including unlimited text and data is the right choice for me.Although it's a 3G cell phone, it's pretty fast.  It's even faster than the 3G cell phone I have from Verizon.The beat audio is very useful for anyone who is using the cell phone to listen to music without a regular speaker.I connect my cell phone directly to my stereo, so I have more sounds option :)All my music are already on Google Music, so I only had to download the Google Music apps and I was right at home.I used to think if I changed cell phone, I would have to re-purchase the apps that I have on my old cell phone, but the good news is that Google save them for me, so I don't have to spend the money (the few dollars:)) to buy them again.  I only had to download them and I am good to go.I give this cell phone 5 stars because that's the highest one I could give.The back button is not as feasible as it is on my old cell phone and any other Android tablets, but it's not a big deal.Although it's not relevant, thank you for introducing me to dropbox, where I can upload files from my computers and access them anywhere I want.Do I have to rate Virgin Mobile on this little box also?UPDATE ON JULY 23, 2013:I just changed from a 5 stars to 1 star.

Great deal. Especially considering it seems to range from 100-200 online.Phone can lag at times, but overall good enough. Camera takes great pictures. But....The camera shutter sound can not be silenced without rooting the phone and altering the shutter sound files, voiding the warranty and risking ruining the phone. It is pretty loud, even when the volume on the phone is silenced. This is the big negative for me. I like being able to snap pictures in public without making noise. Not for pervy reasons, just so that I don't draw attention to myself.Virgin Mobile's service seems good enough for the price. $45/month for 1200 minutes and unlimited messages is perfect for me, more than enough minutes. The 3G, however, ranges from slow to useless depending on my location. Most of the time, it does what it needs to. Good enough for my purposes and for the price; no worse than it was on a previous iphone 3gs on ATT for 75+/month, really. I'd recommend this phone, if you could ever find it on sale for 50 bucks like I did. I think 100 would be fair but I wouldn't spend more than that on it, I don't think. It has its quirks.

A friend got it on an Amazon lightning sale for $70. Radio Shack has knocked it down to $50 at points. This is a very good choice if you want an entry-level smartphone with a decent set of features and mostly acceptable performance. If you have more money to spend, in the $100-200 range, you might check out the HTC Evo instead (right now Virgin has it for $150). Above that, try looking at the Samsung Galaxy SII (which I've seen for as little as $225 on Boost). These pricier phones will give you better performance and bigger screens with HD resolution.But if you're dipping your toe in the smartphone water, this is a fine choice. Some additional observations:1. This comes with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. The current version is 4.1/4.2 Jelly Bean, but HTC will probably not upgrade the OS on this phone due to RAM restrictions. And 5.0 Key Lime Pie will be out in the spring. These new systems are not absolute musts, but I do clearly prefer JB on my Nexus 7.2. This phone has a smaller 3.7-3.8 inch screen. I prefer that and have tablets if I really need a big screen experience. You might not like this, though.3. The phone does not support NFC, so you can't use your e-wallet. It's still a bit early to worry about this, but NFC will probably catch on by next summer. So you need to think through just how carefully you want to prepare now. CVS is already installing the equipment to accept e-wallet payments from phones with this capability. But don't worry. Debit cards won't be obsolete for a little while.4. The phone does not support mobile hotspot operation, which is nice if you are carrying tablets.5. The screen is OK for video although I really think you should consider a bigger phone or a tablet if this is a priority. Angry Birds looks fine on it, though. YouTube works pretty well off a wifi connection but stutters on a 3G link.6. Network performance for Virgin on this phone has been adequate for me but nothing special. I can make calls, read email, get CVS and UPS text alerts, and check the news and weather. That's been fine for now. But the 3G networking is clearly not up to zipping along. If you're in a locale with a lot of public wifi hotspots (e.g., Long Island), you might be able to hop from one to the other. In less metropolitan locales, keep your fingers crossed.7. If you get this phone, invest a little time and money and energy using Google Play to download widgets and active screensavers. Use these to customize your screens to suit yourself. Unlike iOS (which I also use), Android 4+ offers customization opportunities that Apple can't match. In skilled hands, this phone has the potential to make your iPhone friends envious. By the way, while there are ways to purchase through the Amazon Android store on this phone, I've found that it isn't worth the bother. I don't really save anything, and going through the Amazon market makes transferability between my Android devices more problematic.I intend to keep this phone for a year. When the fall 2013 sales heat up, I will replace it with something covering the deficits I mentioned above.PS: If you get this phone, you're also going to need a micro SDHC memory chip. I recommend at least 16 GB. 32 Gb is also OK, and you can always swap it to another phone later. Make sure you get a MICRO chip. Otherwise it won't fit. And get a Class 10 chip, not Class 4 or 6.

I would expect that it would have 2gb or even 3gb free.  It is sad that HTC has no plans to updating this phone to Jelly Bean or being open sourced about this phone so people can do it themselves.  Despite having 'unlimited data' on Virgin Mobile's network, it piggyback off already saturated Sprint's mobile network and data speed will be very slow.

I had others in my family who are more Tech savvie check it to be sure I had all the settings right but they agreed there was something the matter with the answering speaker  The folks at Virgin Mobile suggested that I return the phone for a replacement.  I was somewhat frustrated since I had loaded the phone with personal data and needed to strip it before I sent it back.  It was an easy return as all my dealings with Amazon have been.  So I'm waiting for the new phone and will hopefully give a better review next time.Update: November 9 - I returned  this phone expecting a replacement from Amazon but Amazon removed this item from their website while they checked to be sure there were no further problems with their stock. (I was impressed with this policy and now know that Amazon is very careful that the products they sell meet high standards). I tried to find a similar phone in the same price range that would give me the same features but was unhappy with my choices so since I was a Virgin Mobile customer, I bought the HTC One V from them figuring that if I ran into the same problem I could return it again but I am happy to report that my original phone was a fluke and the new HTC One V works great. No problems so far and I can now give it a 5 star recommendation.

Moved from my 25$ a month plan on my LG Optimus V to this one.In hindsight, while I am not entirely happy with the phone, it is a step up and I kind of don't regret losing the cheaper plan I was grandfathered in on.Pros!Battery life is pretty nice.Screen is bright, looks great.TONS of room to install apps. As I mentioned above, my old phone was an LG Optimus and had a whopping 200~ megs to install them.Beats Audio is actually pretty nice.Cons!Worst wifi I have ever used in my life. My touchpad, android tablet, old LG phone, etc all got 2-3 signal bars out of 3 while in my house. I barely even get the first little dot indicator on this one.Not exactly a thorough instruction manual (moving from 2.2 to 4.0 is fairly different).Phones shape is just, odd to me. It's not flat, and that little bar at the bottom pokes out strangely to me. That being said, I didn't take off any stars from the review for design issues. If it works, it works.Cell camera is kinda \"bleh\" but then again all of em are. BRIGHT LED flash lights up the subjects but also washes out the photos.Worse/slower data than my old LG on the same network.Basically, as I mentioned before, while I don't entirely regret losing my 25$ monthly plan and moving off my old LG, paying 10$ a month more for literally the same thing stings a bit when I don't like the reason I moved that much. It's a great phone, but there are some fairly strong cons to me about it, the major one being the weak wifi signal.Still, it cost me 50$ on the gold box deal, so if you can find it for around 50-60 and are upgrading from an older phone model, it's probably worth it. I would not, however, pay MSRP for this thing or anywhere near it.Virgin Mobile does have some awesome reps though, and when I called in to transfer my phone (mid month, and I wanted to see if I could keep my old month or if I had to start a new one), they peeked at the call record and saw I had only used ~20 minutes. Had me swapped out and going in about 5 minutes and the phone was working for texts in about 10 mins.4 stars for virgin mobile, 3 for the phone.

The only way to get rid of that is to re-boot your phone.2) You can put an icon for your phone contacts, but they never appear when they call or they text you. You have to know their numbers, Doesn't even say that 'so and so is calling' like my old phones. It does show an icon when you text them, but when they reply it comes up as 'unknown'. After looking more into it my friend found blogs from people stating the same problems and long, convoluted possibilities on how to POSSIBLY fix the problem (getting a card to take some of the bloat off the phone).3)When you turn on the phone you have 5 screens to fill- #3 being the 'main screen'. I have found that in the past three months since I have had this the 'main screen' drifts and stays in the 'number c2' position. I then have to go into my settings app and re-do everything. A pain in the ass- let me tell you.4) camera ain't that good. Video quality is better, but not by much.I am getting frustrated with this phone to the point that I am looking to buy another.

Since there is no battery to pull and all external inputs have no effect there is no way to turn it off. Performance has steadily decayed over the year that I have owned this phone. When I got the phone it would stream music about 9 out of ten tries, now it will stream music maybe 1 in 10 attempts. When it does stream it skips worse than a CD player in a washing machine. I suspect Virgin is intentionally slowing the phone to attempt to force customers to upgrade.-BlueTooth: Connects maybe 1 in 5 attempts, settings change by themselves every time there is an update.-General Speed: This phone is SLOW, it often sticks on one screen then delays a tap on that screen for a few seconds until the next screen is displayed.-Battery Life: Anywhere between 10 minutes and 5 hours.

True because the phone ONLY WORKS ON SPRINT NETWORKS. IT WILL NOT SHARE OTHER NETWORKS LIKE MOST OTHER PHONES. YOU CAN ONLY USE THE PHONE WHERE THERE ARE SPRINT FACILITIES AND THERE ARE NONE IN MY AREA.

I live in an area with good VM coverage so I didn't think I'd have any issues with upgrading to a smart phone and keeping VM as my provider. So after pondering it for a few months, I decided to go with the HTC One V phone.It's a good little phone.  Easy to use, and it comes preloaded with most of the apps I use frequently (Facebook, Gmail, etc.)  I hadn't used an Android phone before, mainly I've used my husband's iPhone.  The interface is similar, but perhaps a bit clunkier on the HTC.  I didn't like that the apps had a seperate button to press to access them on a different screen.  At times it made navigating seem choppy but for the price I wasn't going to complain about that.  Internet was good, I didn't find it to be too slow.  Call quality was good as well.What wasn't acceptable was Virgin Mobile's service--I could send, but not receive texts from anyone.  VM customer service response was to tell me to just keep waiting; wait four more hours, wait five more days, wait, wait, wait.  I know you get what you pay for and a lot of people might accept these glitches but I was really irritated by it.  It made me feel as though I'd never be able to know for sure if I was EVER receiving all the texts I was supposed to be receiving.  A Google search revealed that there were plenty of other people who had the same issues with VM service, even going back a number of years.  I could not trust this phone with VM as a provider, so back it went to Amazon and I painfully coughed up the money for an iPhone with AT&T.;  And guess what?  I've never missed a text.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "Adam S.

But when it doesn't work, it's a problem.Take the aforementioned alarm. It works 9 times out of 10. But much like car brakes, you really need an alarm to work 100% of the time. When the alarm fails to go off, there's no rhyme or reason; it just doesn't. And that's a problem.Sometimes text messages just never come through. I know of at least a handful of texts that were sent to me that never showed up... and those are just the ones I know about. Who knows how many others I never saw that I don't even know that I never saw. Again, a 90% success rate on text message receiving isn't good enough. Ditto for missed calls--it's not uncommon for me to have a voicemail for a call that didn't show up as having been missed, nevermind the fact that I had the phone the whole time and it never rang.Sometimes it can't find the WiFi network, even when my other devices aren't having that problem.The HTC One phone seems cheaply made. I've had it for less than three months and it already has a badly cracked screen; it has sustained more cosmetic damage in three months than my last two phones (an LG G2X and an iPhone 3G) sustained in four years combined.This is a cheap phone.

Industry reporting indicates 44 percent of Android users are still using versions 2.3.3 through 2.3.7 - known as Gingerbread - which were released in 2011 and have a number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions. The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date.\"The bulletin proceeded to identify SMS Trojans, rootkits and fake Google Play domains as security threats and offered various mitigation strategies.For example, to fight against SMS Trojans it advised, \"Install an Android security suite designed to combat these threats. These security suites can be purchased or downloaded free from the Internet.\"To protect against fake domains, \"Install only approved applications and follow IT department procedures to update devices' OS. Users should install and regularly update antivirus software for Android devices to detect and remove any malicious applications.\"The IT industry and tech-savvy users have known about these types of security concerns - stemming from Android fragmentation, most mobile phone manufacturers' sloth and indifference, and user inertia and ignorance - for a while now.

My opinion of it might be different if I paid $49, but I paid $189 for the \"convenience\" of a pre-paid service plan. I do not consider this to be \"cheap.\"But even for $49, I would still have the same issue which is basically that the phone is extremely difficult to use. I have fairly small hands, but it is still challenging to hit a target button. But what is more frustrating is the constant struggle to \"blank-out\" a field so I can then move on to the nearly impossible task of entering new text. This happens when trying to enter a URL to go to a website other than Virgin's which ALWAYS comes up. Very occasionally, I am successful in hitting the button to blank it out, but it is far more likely to simply reload VIRGIN's page and make me wait while it does this. It was also an insurmountable problem for what should be a very simple task of renaming the phone for Bluetooth connectivity. I finally had to give up naming it what I wanted to, and had to settle for appending my name in front of the existent standard HTC phone designation.I could go on about other issues I have with the phone, but these are the most annoying and, IMHO, fatal flaws.

This is my rating from a sustainability-ethics standpoint, based on criteria that are just as important to me as function and value.I also rate this phone 4/5 Gold Stars(for functionality and value). I've had it for around six months, it hasn't crashed on me and generally does it's job well (although a small crack did appear in the glass and then grew along the length of the entire screen but that could be related to my dropping it at some point). Virgin coverage is good (particularly considering the monthly fee which is considerably lower than most companies) and I've never had problems with call quality or connection (in contrast to friends on AT&T; or T-mobile). Battery life is decent (unless you are switching from a non-smart-phone in which case you will think it's terrible; you really have to charge it once per day if you use it a moderate amount for email, texts, words with friends, some web browsing, etc.)Back to the Green Star rating: Some reasons that I believe HTC are a decent (4/5 Green Star) company from a mainly environmental perspective:The HTC Evo V is certified by the independent organization UL Environment based on use of environmentally preferable materials with a minimal environmental impact. There are not many cell phones on this list if you check the UL website.In the UK at least (and hopefully in the US soon) they have shipped One X+ phones without chargers, since 70% of buyers already have a compatible charger from another device. This effort to reduce waste is admirable considering that  cell phone companies have failed to get together to fulfill their promise of a universal charger, and Apple have exacerbated the problem recently by introducing a new type of charging cable. HTC have pledged that all their devices will be sold without a charger by 2015 (they would be obtained separately if needed).Their headquarters is extremely green, particularly in terms of energy use and water recycling.HTC offers a free-shipping product recycling service (as do Apple and several other electronics manufacturers).HTC gets the highest score on ethicalconsumer.org, one third higher than Apple and twice as high as Samsung, while LG sits at the bottom of the scale.However, the goodguide.com rates HTC in same the ballpark as Apple, while Samsung and Sony top their list and LG is also close to the top.This brings up an important issue--the criteria used to evaluate the companies vary between organizations, and the reliability of each rating is limited by the amount of time and effort that goes into conducting research into each company and also updating that research over time. That's where you come in, fellow reviewers! I believe that a more useful consensus rating on the ethics and sustainability of each product can be reached on sites such as Amazon, since everyone can weigh in on the criteria that are important to them. As a result, the average rating will represent a consensus on all the criteria considered.There are many issues (for example: treatment of employees) that I have not looked into. That's why we need many reviewers to conduct research, add their voices, and form a consensus.I would welcome Amazon to introduce a second rating scale of 1-5 green stars to go alongside the current gold star rating scale.  That way, reviewers can separately evaluate product functionality and sustainability-ethics issues, and prospective customers can consider both ratings side by side. To mix them into one rating scale can be confusing; after all would you want to buy a wonderful product if it was made by children? Or conversely, would you still want to buy a slightly greener product if people found that it actually didn't work well?Reviewers: Join in and submit your own Green Star ratings at the top of your review as I did here along with your normal Gold Star rating!", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works Decent", "Author": "Kenneth Tarmann", "ReviewID": "R2HCAZ32L2P427", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Works decent but even though it is on the Sprint network, don't plan on upgrading to a Sprint contract service with this phone, the software on it is incompatible with actually running on their network.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone but problem with voice clarity", "Author": "Bill Green", "ReviewID": "RGXV0V3Z24MPY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this phone from RS for 100 dollars for use on Virgin network.

Although the Triumph and the One V are in the same price range, they are nowhere near the same device. The Triumph has a few things the One V doesn't, for example, a front facing camera,an .3 inch larger screen, and an HDMI slot. In most other areas, the HTC One V is victorious. Motorola phones are a strange breed. There are some excellent Motorola phones out their, like the Droid Razr Maxx. But there are also a ton of sub par phones out there. The problem is, Motorola just makes far too many phones. The Motorola Triumph is one of the victims of this model. By comparison, the HTC One V is available from multiple carriers, and is not just a model that was put out there to be the \"Virgin Mobile model\". From a design standpoint, these phones are largely different. The Motorola Triumph isn't far from looking like a brick. It's very square, and isn't exactly ugly, but it's one of the more plain looking phones out there. The HTC One V, however, is a beautiful, fairly thin phone. It's the same with as an iPod touch, although about twice as thick, and the screen is closer to a 16:9 ratio, just like the newly released iPhone 5. And like the iPhone 5, the HTC One V is a unibody design, except for the small part at the bottom that can be opened and a Mini-SD card can be inserted. Compare that to the Motorola Triumph. I've had two of them, and on both of them, the pesky battery door kept falling off the back. In fact, one time the door fell off and I ended up losing my Micro SD card. The operating system on the Motorola Triumph is 2.2 Froyo, where-as the operating system on the One V is 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. In those 2 generations of updates, there are quite a bit of differences between these 2 phone operating systems. The reason the Triumph never got updated past 2.2 is presumably because Motorola doesn't see it worth their time to port the newer updates to this phone. I've mentioned earlier that the display on the Triumph is bigger. This is true, but I did notice that on the One V, the colors are more vibrant. The color red, especially, pops right off the screen. The rear camera on the Triumph is not very good. While the one on the One V isn't the greatest either, it's definitely quite better. And the included shutter and aperture settings make it possible to get a pretty good picture in low light even without using the flash. This is a good thing to hear for video, wherein the flash wouldn't be of use anyway. I did notice that the Motorola Triumph had superb audio quality in the voice recording department. I was quite surprised that I could get such great sound out of my phone. And when I tried my One V's voice recording feature, it didn't quite stack up. At least not at first. I realized after a bit that the One V has a more sensitive microphone, which causes it to over-modulate very easily. Because of this, I found that the best way to record sound on this phone is to hold the phone at least 2 feet away from your face. HTC Sense is included in all HTC Android phones. Personally I have found it marginally useful, something I could take or leave. The audio on the Triumph is fairly good to begin with, but the Beats Audio Technology exclusive to HTC phones is amazing. The HTC One V is available from US Cellular, Virgin Mobile, and Cricket. The Motorola Triumph is exclusive to Virgin Mobile.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "It will Die on you", "Author": "Florida Boater \"djjimmyd\"", "ReviewID": "R247HLU9ZNKXAY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The HTC One V.

When I called to transfer my number from T-Mobile I had to wait for one customer help in India to pass me on to another and finally ended up listening to Taylor Swift singing Back To December a hundred times. Then the guy had me type some numbers into the phone and then said the change would take effect within 24 hours. Now 30 hours later I'm listening to Taylor Swift singing Back To December for the 200th time and hoping somebody will come on before it's quitting time. My T-Mobile phone still works with the old number and my Virgin phone won't ring with  any number. So just to warn you guys. I've spent another 45 minutes today so far listening to Back To December and then every minute a quick talking ad for Virgin Phone then back to Taylor Swift and pretty soon I'll have to hang up because I have to go home. Finally I got a guy who said he figured out how to make it work. But it didn't. Now it's three days later and neither Tmobile or the Virgin phone will work. When I called today they've changed the music so I listened to that repeat for half an hour and got a guy in the Phillipines who did something and the Virgin phone came to life. So it took three full days and a total of about three hours on hold to port over my Tmobile phone number. Then I found out that the $10 payment I made three days ago hasn't been credited to my minutes although the transaction shows up on their computer. But the guy in the Phillipines can't figure out why. So he make me pay more money so the phone would accept calls. He finally gave up trying to solve the ten dollar problem and said to call back in four hours.  He knew I would get somebody else then. So is it worth sitting on hold for another 45 minutes to see if somebody else can find the ten dollars. Maybe not. The phone is working now.

I checked out all the options & got this phone because of the good reviews. This phone is worse than the old phone she has now which is an LG Optimus. The colors that show up on the screen are all messed up. They're dull looking & faded. Navy blue is navy blue. Not pale blue like it shows on this phone when she's on a siteshe normally goes on. Downloading this phone takes forever whereas her old LG phone is a little more quicker. She's used this phone for several days now & it's still the same. No change. The only good thing I can say about it is the size is fine for her small hands. Other than that it's not worth the money. I'm glad I'm able to return this for a full refund.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone let alone a friend of mine.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Virgin Mobile users pass on this", "Author": "Christopher T Foose", "ReviewID": "R9FYRPO7Q4G4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Currently I am on a grandfathered Virgin Mobile plan.  That means as long as I keep using my LG Optimus V I can stay on the $25 \"unlimited\" plan.  Their plan is not truly unlimited as they throttle data when you hit the 2.5 GB mark.  However, you can get through this by topping up again.I mention this because Virgin Mobile has long done away with their Unlimited text and data plan for $25 and has bumped rates to $35 for my type of plan.  If I didn't have the grandfathered option I would drop VM for another carrier.  They had cited the 4G network as the reason for the price increase and if you keep to a current list of 3G phones you could keep your $25 a month rate.The HTC V One is a 3G phone.  However, if I wanted to transfer my services to it I would be giving up the $25 a month plan and have to pay $35 instead.  For a phone without 4G capability causing this type of price increase it is not worth it.The retail price is too high for this type of limited hardware.  I bought this phone during a RadioShack special for $50 which included $10 back in credit.  Even paying this price for it I have second thoughts of whether it was a good buy.Here are some good aspects to this phone.It records video in HD quality.  I considered buying a Flipcam, however, I never did because that product is not longer being made and eventually will stop being supported.  This is an excellent alternative.  The video quality is very decent.As a music player it is great.  Audio sounds great.  Supposedly there is Beats Audio technology included in the phone however I have heard that this doesn't really do much besides compress the audio.If you can get VOIP working on the phone it is a great extra handset.  The build is sleek and slim.  The glass feels smooth and incredibly sturdy and scratch resistant.As for the hardware tweakers who want to install a custom rom you will be severely disappointed especially if you wish to use the camcorder and camera aspects of the phone,.  When using this it does crash a lot.  I have heard that it is due to propietary information that HTC has not released to developers.  I have also heard that the auto-focus crashes the phone.  The custom roms I have tried have all been JellyBean based and have had these identical problems.  Since I really want this as a video recorder I reverted to a modified version of the stock rom.  That means I am using Ice Cream Sandwich, which is okay.Also, I want to mention that this device is a pain to root and install custom roms.  If you are looking to modify this hardware for your specifications I would pass.The small display is really good and crisp.  I love looking at pictures and watching YouTube videos on this handset.Overall I like having a small sleek device to take pictures and video with.  However I recommend that most people pass on this particular phone.  The main reasons being that it lacks 4G capability and is limited when it comes to modifying.  HTC might release a JellyBean update for this but I wouldn't count on it.So... pass..  do not buy.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "No available pre-paid plans without huge data charges", "Author": "M.

After one month, when I went to change plans from unlimited to top-up, I could not.  Virgin customer support said that the Kyocera was not a \"Pay-lo\" phone and I had to choose a monthly unlimited plan.  Wait a minute, you have free wi-fi on there, right?  Right.  So I can connect to free wi-fi hotspots if I want to right?  Right.  And pay by the call, right?  Right.  Well, then WHY exactly do I have to pay close to forty a month for an unlimited plan??
