The dual slider keyboards are a big plus to me. And the fact it is not a \"smart\" phone. The only things I had a problem was the manual which was too cursory in their coverage of the phone's options. I had to go to my Ford dealer to find out how to get the contacts downloaded to my MS SYNC. It turns out the have to be \"pushed\" one at a time to the SYNC system. However there is no place in the manual it explains how to do it. Now that I know how, all is fine. It was tedious and time consuming, but it worked. I'm glad I don't have a ton of contacts I call.Other things not covered in the manual are how to add optional ringtones from you computer. Turns out they can't be bigger than 300KB. This is not documented. I also want to switch from the SIM phone book to the Phone phone book as it allows more options, but so far I can figure out that option. A more complete manual sure would be better. Thank goodness for the AT&T; community blog. It sure has been useful.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "I LOVED THAT PHONE", "Author": "wiesman1000", "ReviewID": "R3AP5SATXRVLY3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Im 15 now... I used this phone for about 3 years in middle school when I texted the most. This phone was easy to use (for me at least) and just great. I just replaced it for christmas when my sister begged my dad for a smart phone. He said yes and though I was a little reluctant at first I got an android and honestly, I miss this phone. My android can be nice with internet but the keyboard sucks. THe matrix has the beast keyboard every I could text so fast without screwwing up like on a screen keyboard. I have honestly just stopped texting. I never text anymore its sad. With the matrix i sent like 20,000 texts a month. Now I honestly send like 50. Long story short great phone.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works well for the price", "Author": "MsKayG \"MsKayG\"", "ReviewID": "R2I9CXKSXBRYQH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is great.  I bought it for my husband as a gift and he loves it.

Jensen", "ReviewID": "R2OXZCJHWHSIH9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this Pantech phone for awhile now.  And it's terrible.  I can barely hear people when I'm talking on the phone; I'm constantly going, \"What? Say again?\" like I'm ninety or something.  The only good thing this phone has is its keyboard and that's it.What is worse is that the battery is a cheap piece of junk.  I can't go more than a day without having to recharge it.  Now, I know smartphones take up a lot of energy, using the internet, games, texting and phone calls, but here's the catch--I barely use those features!  I've never gotten the internet on this phone and I'm not a phone person regardless.  The phone just dies from idling after 24 hours of non-use.  If I happen to use the phone--even once--I get a \"bar\" taken off my battery life.  From one call.Now, my ringer is only working half the time, so I only get half my calls.  I'm planning to buy a new phone here really soon, and then I plan to take this one and slam it into an unmovable object.I'm pretty tech-savvy; I'm the person my office goes to when they can't get their computer software to work properly, so don't think just because I don't have internet on my phone, I'm clueless how this device should work.

She first got it when it first came out, she had that one for about 3 years. After the first one wore out she bought another one because she hated her upgrade.

She says it's a good sturdy phone, that makes it easy for her to text and hear when making phone calls.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "F.
