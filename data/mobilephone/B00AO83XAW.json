Just a basic phone with no frills which is what I wanted.Had problem with Callender date until I was told to use DD/MM/YYYY to enter day and have it stay correct. Dont get a great signal at my home but I suspect it is the AT&T; service since it works fine when out of my area.For the money I havent seen anything to compare...

Fox", "ReviewID": "R3Q710SMZQ5DYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It arrived quickly and I love the size of the phone. Unfortunately I can't program it because it is in Spanish. The entire thing is in Spanish even the instructions. This makes the phone completely useless to me unless I can find someone to program it to display English.I finally got it onto English!!! I love the phone. It's easy to personalize (once you get to English) and its very lightweight. It is a VERY BASIC phone! I don't need all the bells and whistles so it's perfect for me.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for a starter phone", "Author": "Bshapard", "ReviewID": "R29NM08RLL74EO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my 12 year old daughter.it's a perfect size for her and a great starter phone.no need to have a data plan, does not accept pictures but that's ok hence no data plan needed, saves me money, that is exactly what I was looking for.she loves it, she listens to music on it.
