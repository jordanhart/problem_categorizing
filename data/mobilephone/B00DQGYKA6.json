BEWARE the 2g Service in the USA is going away, AT&T; just \"upgraded\" its system in Portland, OR. and other major cities in the USA and the 2G system has \"experienced significant DEGRADATION\"That is from THREE (3) different AT&T; Reps.so where the phone would use the 2G system to make and receive calls it DOESN'T NOW. Sorry to say a GREAT phone but BAD service and no support from Lenovo in the USA \" as we don't sell it in the USA there isn't a support Team or contact information for support\" from Lenovo IDEA/THINK products division.
