{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone, Excellent Price, Fake Battery", "Author": "Forrest", "ReviewID": "R3OOS5RUAYTOUQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay, so the Samsung Galaxy Note II is obviously a great phone, and as I feel that reviews of this nature should focus more on the seller, I won't discuss how amazing this phone is, in and of itself.  This phone is roughly $800 from AT&T;, Verizon, and Amazon out-of-contract. The seller listing the product here is selling it for $300 less than anyone else and it's not used or refurbished. That is pretty spectacular.  However, the battery that came with this phone is next to useless. It has no brand name marked on it and just says Made In China. The life of the battery is terrible. I literally have to leave my phone plugged into the wall at all times. If I unplug it, the battery drains waaaay too quickly. My friend has this phone and his battery is not even close to as bad as mine. He bought his phone from Verizon and it came with a battery that, while it looks similar in marking and color to mine, it says Samsung across it. Mine does not. His charger is also completely different. It's very likely that my charger is a fake too, although the piece that plugs into the outlet says Samsung on it, it is not the stock charger that comes with the phone.  The phone, battery, and charger came in a plain AT&T; box that was not sealed, although it was shrinkwrapped. Part of the box had been torn and patched with scotch tape. It came with the appropriate manual. Fortunately, despite all of this, the phone itself is 100% legitimate and works perfectly. I will be forced to purchase a real battery for $20 or so and I will probably invest in a new charger at a later time, but this doesn't really bother me a lot.  It irks me, slightly, that the seller felt the need to sell the phone with a s***ty battery, but honestly, a battery and the actual Samsung Note II box is NOT worth $300 extra dollars to me. If you need to buy this phone out of contract, then I would recommend purchasing it from this seller even though their choice of sending it with a fake battery is questionable, you'll still come out ahead purchasing this phone here and a new battery from somewhere else. I'm still relatively happy with my purchase.  Perhaps the seller should notify that this device ships with a third-party battery instead of the OEM Samsung battery, but it's not a HUGE deal.  If you want this phone new, get it here unless you want to pay $300 for a nice box and a battery. If you're okay with a used phone, then I recommend you go to Swappa and look there. I don't like buying used electronics like this, however.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worked right out of the box, but...", "Author": "William E. Tomlin", "ReviewID": "R3RDECN3SLTHQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone arrived as scheduled apparently undamaged.  The box was a plain box labeled \"AT&T;\" but not a new retail AT&T; box.  There was no, absolutely no, paperwork in the box just the phone, the battery, the wall charger, a usb cable and a set of Samsung earbuds.  The phone is a wonderful piece of electronics and the Android OS is easy to learn and use.  I had to get a new sim, my old one was a full size and the Note 2 uses a mini.  The phone was instantly recognized by the AT&T; system and picked up both a cell and data signal. The problem that I am having is with the usb connection.  It is apparently defective. I can charge the battery, but only consistently if the phone is off.  I have only been able to connect with my computer once, and that was a struggle.  I have contacted Samsung and they have assured me that the phone is under warranty should I need to get it repaired but that requires sending the phone in and having to pay to ship it there and being without it for who knows how long.  As this is a \"new\" phone and an expensive phone one would expect that it would not need to be repaired upon arrival.  I have not contacted the seller yet as I am still trying to see if the problem is software or hardware related.Pros:Beautiful screenFast processorResponsive OSActually good battery life (when I can get it charged)Cons:AT&T; crapware that is unremovable (this on top of the OS and Samsung's software left a little over 10 gig out of the base 16 gig usable)the usb connection problem that I am havingI would still recommend this phone to anyone that needs the screen size and does not mind the fact that it is a big phone.UPDATE 5/3/13:The problem with the USB port was resolved by resetting the phone to factory default (had to download the manual from Samsung for directions).  The problem did let me find out 2 things: 1 - the seller was quick to offer an exchange if necessary, good communication response and helpful and 2 - the phone is covered by a Samsung 1 year warranty, you do have to register the phone for warranty support.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Raymond O'Connor", "ReviewID": "R2YUMFHPUIGO4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3N86UE2RQ2CQK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this phone 1st week of June. I worked beautifully till August 26, almost 90 days when the screen started to blur, move and change color. It worked one day with the stylus although blurry. The next day the screen went black but the home button and back button worked, the light at the top showed it was on.  Samsung will not help, their website doesn't recognize this phone, their tech support could only narrow the country of origin down to India, Phillipines, Ireland or UK and only had phone numbers for three of the four countries!  Apparently it is my job to attempt to find the correct country and then get service according to Samsung.  I've emailed three countries with no reply yet ...by the way you find other countries sites by clicking the tiny flag on the bottom of the main US website.Using the really awsome help of my brother's research, we determined the issue was probably the screen flex cable, (due to the stylus worked for a day so the digitizer was probably working), I used the also awesome youtube repair video by Le55ons (thanks!) and took apart my Note 2 and found the flex cable for the screen was covered in corrosion.  This is not water damage, it is inside and there is no evidence of damage anywhere but on the pins when I separated them. I cleaned them with a dry tooth brush and put it back together; the screen turned on several times but is still flickering and having connectivity issues. I can't find flex cables for the screen to purchase and a complete digitizer setup costs $250 plus shipping, more than a Google Nexus 4 $199. currently.Next stop Google, if you check corrosion Note 2 you'll find pages and pages of recent consumer complaints about Samsung corrosion issues, often caused by faulty electronic connections according to some posts, and a complete lack of customer service as I experienced.I'll buy a Google phone next, they'll at least have a decent website and someone to communicate with if I have an issue.Rant:Samsung, I know you are so popular in Asia and Europe that you don't care about my customer service but this is partly why Apple is still King in the US since we have to pay so much for the product here and risk crappy to zero support, unless you pay for insurance, which is a ripoff if the phone works as intended. I won't buy Samsung again if I can find another suitable product, and certainly not without waiting for and doing really careful research on consumer reports.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as described", "Author": "abie kamara", "ReviewID": "R3APDEZ01W3CJO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Stylus was missing, phone arrived broken, case is chipped, warranty is not one year and phone is not brand new", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "A problem in the phone", "Author": "Ahmed AbdelRahim", "ReviewID": "R13U6Y30YUA9NN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There was a problem in the phone.
