Cox", "ReviewID": "R1OQUDBH74IFQF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace my wife's cell phone and it has worked very well.  It is solidly constructed and has already survived a fall!  I just popped the SIM card out of her old blackberry and popped it in this phone.  The one caveat is that I can't seem to find a way to turn off the 3G radio on the phone (my wife doesn't have a data plan), so be careful about not using any data if you don't have a plan.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for what I need it for", "Author": "Erik", "ReviewID": "R2HAU6ZO0X49R8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My office issued me an iPhone, which I managed to drop and destroy the screen on within the first month. Being that my personal phone is an Android-based phone that I prefer over the iPhone anyway, I decided to the LG Shine for a sim-card swap rather than get the iPhone repaired.The LG Shine works very well. The call quality is just as good as any smartphone I've used. Its interface is fast and easy to use. Its network performance is terrific, and I'm getting coverage in areas that I can't manage to get signal on my smartphone.Just so it's clear: this phone does not have any email functionality, except for Yahoo Mail, AOL, AIM, Windows Live, AT&T; Yahoo, BellSouth, Comcast, Earthlink, Juno, MindSpring, and NetZero. These appear to be hard-coded into the Java Applet it uses for email, so don't plan on any mail functionality on the phone unless you have one of the above services (also note, that due to the phone's age, this functionality may no longer be supported by your email provider, either).Its reflective surface makes it very fingerprint-prone, and the number keys don't have a consistent level of lighting, but neither of these make it unusable. I found that the movement \"stick\" for moving around the interface takes a little bit of time to get used to. The ring volume is modest, but perfectly adequate for when I'm carrying the phone in my pants pocket. Despite this, the speakerphone is more than loud enough.The battery life is terrific. It can last over 48 hours under heavy use. I haven't had an opportunity to test its Bluetooth functionality, unfortunately.The phone I received has AT&T; branding, but it just so happened that my SIM card is for AT&T;, so all of the AT&T-specific; services work correctly.The phone is very similar in design and network compatibility as a phone I used when living in South Korea, and I have no doubt that I will be able to bring this phone with me and swap the SIM if I choose to return to South Korea. This comes as no surprise, being that LG is a Korean company.Amazon was responsible for the order, but Onewirelessking was the vendor/store that Amazon used.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone, T-Mobile Users beware.", "Author": "Jared H", "ReviewID": "R5TL2BPKQDPT5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my t mobile plan because i liked the solid slider look as well as the generally positive reviews. This phone has a beautiful LCD screen for a simple slider phone and a nice blue lit key pad as well as lots of memory for texts and contacts. The phone also supports multitasking which i thought was great (and odd) for a lower end slide phone. The only thing i have bad to save about this phone at all is the home screen menu is NOT customizable at all meaning your stuck with the \"Menu\" button on the left soft key and the \"Options\" button on the right soft key. But worse then that is this phone is unlcocked and my sms and calls work fine but whenever i tried to send an mms message my phone would give me a strange comm error. I talked to a t mobile rep about it and said i would have to purchase a data plan for my phone. Not wanting to do this for this particular simple phone i decided to tackle the problem on my own. After wading through pages of google searches i discovered this is how you send and receive mms using t mobile on this particular AT&T; handset. On the phone itself go to Menu>Messaging>Message Settings>Multimedia Message>Message Center. You will seen the active profile labeled AT&T; MMS. Press the Options button on the right soft key and select \"New\". Then enter the following information:Name: T-Mobile MMSMMSC URL: [...]MMSC Proxy:216.155.165.050MMSC Port: 8080Connection Mode: TCP without ProxyNetwork Profile: MEdia NetworkThen save the profile and activate it with the left soft key. Reboot your phone and voila tmobile mms on your LG Shine. This may sound complex but dont let it stop you from buying the phone once you have the phone in hand you'll see what I'm talking about. Also make sure your service says T-Mobile at the bottom of the home screen before sending an mms because sometimes it will say you have full bars but it means full bars for AT&T; and no bars for T mobile.

I wanted one so bad the first time I saw it. I've owned my Shine for 4 years now. It has literally been through hell and high water. It's been dropped, kicked, stepped on, sat on, thrown, drowned in a toilet and it still works perfectly. It's got it's scratches and dings but it's still pretty and shiny. I've never had a case for it. I still have the original battery but it needs to be replaced now because it gets low and starts beeping at me after using it a lot in one day but will stay on for a few days when not used often. When I got my new LG Prime and the calibration went out after a month, I went back to my Shine. I would like to get a new phone so that I can save my Shine as a back up phone but I just don't think I can find a phone that's as durable. Perhaps I should just buy a new Shine since I enjoy it so much.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Proprietary charger input slot did not last", "Author": "LG", "ReviewID": "R1FIHY1BM6PBTD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone purchased in July, looks nice, worked ok until December, light adult use.  I've had many many phones, none have ever lost ability to charge due to cable not attaching well to the input slot, which in this case got worn out prematurely, so charge cuts in and out intermittently due to poor connection.  I tried to take fine tweezers to readjust the spots in the slot that may have been warped, helped for a day or two, and problem persists.

I played around with it and loved it.This phone has a 2 MP Fixed Focus Camera (no auto or macro focus) with an LED Flash and a QVGA Camcorder that records at 15 FPS, 384 kbps.  Audio recorded in videos use AMR.  I don't remember what the audio bit rate is.This phone takes a MicroSD card with a maximum capacity of 4GB.  In order to take the memory card out or put a new one in, you need something that's razor-like thin to push it.  You can play MP3's, but you need an adapter in order to use headphones.  Otherwise your choices are the speaker or bluetooth if you have a bluetooth headset.This phone does have 3G.  I never had the chance to utilize it, so I don't know how fast or reliable it is.The battery life is good as well. I mainly used this phone for the camera & text messaging with the occasional phone call.  With my usage, the battery lasted me about 3 days before I had to recharge it.The phone is pretty durable when I had it.  I don't have it anymore because I had it in a pocket with plenty of room, and it unfortunately reached as far as my knee.  I went to sit down and I ended up kneeing the screen, breaking it.  I ordered a replacement screen, but it didn't help.  I don't know if the new screen I ordered was defective, but I didn't want to waste any more of my money trying.

I really like the sleek, all silver appearance!  And, it works well, but I wish that the highest keys on the keypad, the call, cancel, and end call keys, had more space between the sliding top of the phone because they are hard to press because of where they are located.  And, I wish the calendar had more room to write events (there is just a subject line).  But, otherwise, the phone is wonderful!  I really like the camera!  It takes clear pictures!

Some people mentioned that the ball controller in the middle is a bit weird, but once you get used to it it's perfectly fine.Two things to specifically mention though.1) Ringtone has to be smaller than 300kb? I never knew this, but apparently the new LG CU720 models produced has a limit on ringtone size. It has to be under 300kb and it cannot be longer than 25 seconds.2) the buttons are hard to push.
