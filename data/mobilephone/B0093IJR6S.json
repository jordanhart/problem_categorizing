You can get it working, but you must buy your airtime from a separate retailer (Walmart, Best Buy, Calling Mart, etc.), and then this SIM will work for you. I've changed my rating to 3 stars to reflect this discovery*I've never felt so stupid when trying to register/buy/activate something online.So the SIM card is fine - it's a SIM card, ya know? No big deal. But it comes with instructions to activate the card via [...] or a toll free number. Each is equally mind numbing.Go to the website, start the activation process, enter all the requested information, and then run into a screen which says that an Airtime plan is required for activation. No problem, I understood that I would need to purchase the airtime plan separately. The problem is this: purchasing airtime is not an option unless the phone/SIM has already been activated.So, I need the airtime plan to activate the SIM, but I need the SIM activated to purchase the airtime plan. What? *Edit: To solve this, go buy the airtime plan from a third party, like Walmart, Best Buy, or Calling Mart - this can be purchased online, code delivered immediately via email.*To the phone! Calling the toll free number, hoping to get it sorted quickly, I first sit through a long automated message reiterating everything posted online and written in the documentation that came with the SIM. Then I make my selections from the automated menus, the robot tells me they are experiencing high call volume and can't take any more calls, and then hangs up on me. I try again a few more times, and it hangs up on me each time. I wait a few minutes, call back, the robot tells me it will be a 30min wait, and puts me in the queue. 56 minutes later, I give up, having spoken to no one.Where to turn? I try the Net10 online forum, where my questions can't be answered because they can't respond to my questions until my questions have been approved, and I must first make 5 posts before my questions can be approved. Truly the least sensible forum system I have ever encountered. So, again, I give up.Three strikes, Net10.My conclusion? Net10 does not want my money. If they did, they would make it easy for me to give it to them.

You can't use sim card in any of their other phones and don't try and port your existing number without being on the phone with someone from India for hours. Currently I just bought their sim card and I'm using my AT&T; LOCKED HTC Inspire 4G on their $50 a month plan. It works great but internet data rates although said to be at 4G speeds isn't the best at times but does worked. to recap customer service does suck at times but I live in South Jersey and phone service is excellent. I pay less then half of what I used to for only 400 minutes with ATT. Net 10 servie is worth the hassles if you live in an area where they have service like NJ. I installed an App called My data manager that helps me keep track of my data use since they do limit data to 1.5gb and then cut you off. It does a great job at letting me know which programs hog the most data so I try and use those only when WIFI is present.

Fannin \"seanhobbs\"", "ReviewID": "RYOWDEOAH155B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As of 03.01.2013, data is capped at 1.5GB per month (or 30 day prepaid cycle). Once 1.5GB is reached, data is DISABLED, not speed reduced, until the next month (or 30 day prepaid cycle). So, if you reach 1.5GB 20 days in, you have to wait 10 days to get data services again. Currently there is no option to buy additional data.Overall, still a great alternative to off contract AT&T; users who are looking to jump ship, aren't heavy data users, and who don't/can't get descent T-Mobile service (like me). Additionally, phones coming off AT&T; don't have to be unlocked.FWIW, Straight Talk is now officially a T-Mobile based service (previously AT&T; activated Straight Talk subscribers are not affected, except by a similar data cap as mentioned above for NET10). ATM, Straight Talk only offers reduced data speed service, after your prepaid subscription specific monthly amount of full speed data service is reached, for current and new T-Mobile Straight Talk subscribers.In short, if you have an unlocked GSM (AT&T; or T-Mobile) phone, and get decent T-Mobile service, get Straight Talk. If you have a locked GSM AT&T; or an unlocked GSM (AT&T; or T-Mobile) phone, and can't get decent T-Mobile service, get NET10.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Many Problems with data", "Author": "david.rogers.", "ReviewID": "R2ZZYW006CLRDN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a net10 unlimited att sim and after a month the data stopped work six weeks later and still no datasee wwwdotnet10forumdotcom and read the mobile web access forumNo customer service many complaints it is not just me", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Unlimited, Horrible Customer Service, Will Not Use Again!", "Author": "tiger", "ReviewID": "RCJ56CFFYVEKN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a Bring your Phone customer, one day, phone stopped working.

The sales person at the brick and mortar store claimed I could tether a laptop to it for internet access; which was far from reality.  The only internet access is through the phone using the poor resolution screen, extremely bad touch keypad, really buggy software, and extremely slow connection speed.  The only browser choice is google chrome and it would not work with my personal email, only web based email systems like g-mail. I tried to find support for the bluetooth not pairing with my Plantronics hands free device; I found a website that wanted the phone serial number but wouldn't take the number I found in the phone's system settings and the link to how to find the serial number only led me to a sales data page for the phone.  Net10 is obviously only in the business of selling, not supporting or delivering on their sales hype.  ZERO Stars on this one or maybe there should be a negative star system for things like this.Update: I have suffered with this phone for 5 months an it only gets worse with time.  During a call, the phone will suddenly re-boot for no reason and lose all of the changes I made to the default settings including the setting that allows the allows the abysmal internet access; that setting is buried in the settings where it is almost impossible to find.

It is very clearly written in the description that it does not includes airtime so you have to buy it on your own.Now coming to activation. Net10 offers many plans but only $50 OR $65 airtime can be used to activate the SIM. Later you can go for any other plan before the running plan expires. Can also enroll in auto debit programs which saves some money each month. I use the unlimited $50 plan which costs me $45 because I enrolled for auto debit.So please get this clear.

After paying $50 for unlimited data,text (including international text)and talk, the international text was deactivated without prior notice to customers. On February 21, 2013 I had a message from this network provider that read 'Effective March 1, your ATT compatible sim service will be limited to 1.5GB of data per 30 days. Visit [...] to learn more'. I recharged my phone on April 16, 2013 with the $50 plan but was not able to access the internet. I called the customer service for assistance but was told i have violated their terms and condition regarding the use of data and because of that my internet speed has been reduced. Reduced? To what? The customer service representative was not able to give me an answer. The fact of the matter is that they have deactivated my internet instead of reducing the speed. My question is what happens to the 1.5GB data i have paid for? Don't i have the right to use the 1.5GB data i paid for as and how i please? How do i violated the stupid terms and conditions of NET10 if I decide to listen to Pandora till i exhaust my 1.5GB data 'meant for 30 days'. I sincerely advice potential subscribers to think twice before signing up with this mobile provider. Bunch of fraudsters and blood sucker out there to exploit the innocent consumer.

I decided to try NET10 on a whim and i was greatly disappointed.  Normally all i have to do is go online to activate a Sim card.  Pick your plan and phone number unless you are porting your old number.  That is it.  NET10 had me created an account first, then select the plan. When i did this, my credit card was charged but i never received a number. It said my transaction was not completed please call the 1800 number.  I checked my credit card and the payment was pending to NET10.  I called the customer service number. The lady told me that it was only a pre authorization and it should drop off the next day.  Right i have never seen a pre authorization on any Credit card drop off less than 4 business days.  She informed me she could get me activated but i would need to pay for a new plan.  (WHAT).  I said NO, i will wait until the next day once my money has been credit back to me.  Two days past and it was still pending.  I again tried to call customer service.  This time i was transferred to a INDIA service center.  Which they cant do anything but answer the phone and pass you to someone else.  Needless to say i will NEVER use NET10.  I loss $5 on this but i probably saved myself a headache in the future.

This happened 2 weeks ago.  The girl I spoke to from Net10 said that we could just keep the minutes and when asked if this would effect the minutes we have accrued she said no.  Now I am ready to renew my phone and all of minutes are going to be wiped.  I spoke with customer service (or what they call customer service) and after going through 3 different people in a foreign country may I add, they said there is nothing I can do.
