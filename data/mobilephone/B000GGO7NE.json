After purchasing my Sony Cybershot DSC-T50 I figured why would I need a camera phone, so I ordered the M600i and tested it out upon arrival. A Sony phone with a Sony camera...you'd think that would be a perfect combination to rival peanut butter and jelly or chicken and waffles! :)I returned it via UPS after one day.Doing away with the camera was no issue, for I had only planned to use it as my PDA and word processor for my poetry and blog entries. Interface-wise it reflects the p990 in every way from the touchscreen navigation to the colorful display with a slightly smaller screen. Unfortunately this reflection of the p990 is what starts to get this thing in trouble.If you read my review on the p990 you will see two HUGE cons that I screamed bloody murder over: no Apple iSync support and slow Quickoffice Word firmware. The M600i has these same issues and also brings another one to the table of its very own: its qwerty keyboard.  As interesting as this keyboard is with two letters per button, it just did not work for me. Even though both the M600 and p990 have small buttons, I guess it was psychologically easier for me to use the p990 with each letter having its own key.Another issue is build quality. Compared to the p990 and my current Nokia E61i the M600 comes across as a toy, not a smartphone. This phone may be a good alternative to Bond girls, but I don't think I'll be running around in an evening gown in Casino Royale part 2 anytime soon (even then I would have my Nokia instead). :)", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "M600I - Great Phone", "Author": "Kevin Hunte", "ReviewID": "R3AAENFM48S1F8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone.
