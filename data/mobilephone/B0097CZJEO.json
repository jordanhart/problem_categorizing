{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's An iPhone....Again", "Author": "Vanessa Rutherford \"van the book bandit\"", "ReviewID": "R1D6RB2RONG1N8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Warning: My reviews are thorough, straight forward, and to the point...I am and always will be an avid supporter of Apple, despite their obscene prices & sometimes annoying level of arrogance in the world of marketing technology. Say what you will about Apple, there is no denying their superiority when it comes to the quality & capabilities of their products. When I picked up my first iphone in 2008 (a 3GS), I fell in love with the simplicity of Apple iOS & just how easy it is to navigate. Since then, I've owned the 4, the 4s, & now the 5. At this point, Needless to say, I'm accustomed to iOS & trying to use phones with other operating systems like Android & Windows gives me the worst headache you could imagine.Now down to the dirty side of this review. Yes, I gave the iphone 5 five stars. Why? Because it does everything it claims to do. It has a slightly faster processor, slightly larger screen, & better resolution than its predecessor. The screen quality, imho, is its best asset. I will not judge the quality of the phone by how much it costs like a large percentage of other reviewers, because it is completely irrelevant in making a fair assessment of the phone itself. Besides that fact, it is pretty comparable in price to any other similar smartphone that you would buy outright without a contract. Want an iPhone but don't want to pay half a grand? Get a contract like I did & stop whining....Moving on to the dirty, this will probably be my last iPhone purchase for a while. Why? As I've come to realize with age, shelling out $200 every single year over an upgrade to a phone that has had little to no significant changes is beyond ridiculous. Most do it for the sake of saying they own the latest iPhone. Some do it for the sake of spending money. Either way, My advice would be to not fall into the conformities of society. Buy the 4s or 5 (which are practically the same darn phone) slap an Otter box or other brand of thick protector on it (it'll live longer, trust me) & vow to hold out until Apple steps it up an acceptable amount of notches. And honestly, at this point in their game, I don't see that happening for a while. It's a vicious money cycle with Apple and I'll be the first to say...I will not be buying the inevitable & sure to come: iPhone 5s at the end of the year. Unless it can wash my clothes, cook my dinner, & read me a bedtime story....(-_-)", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Stupidly High Price", "Author": "Juan Carlos Brioso", "ReviewID": "R1FSKGH65VN2Y6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you buy this phone on amazon or anywhere else for the $1000+ price tag, your just a fool. This phone is great, but only slightly better than the 4S which also runs ios6. The iPhone 5 has a bigger screen which is useful, a slightly better processing chip, and that's about it. If you don't own an iphone, getting a 4 or 4S is a better deal since will cost you like 40% less but is only like 10% inferior to the iphone 5.More importantly, on top of that, do you guys think Apple is stupid? They will soon enough come out with iphone 5 unlocked to sell at their stores. They are only selling it with carriers at the moment so the carriers can make money and therefore Apple makes money because carriers pay Apple to do that. But just like the iphone 4S, the iphone 5 will soon be sold unlocked at a retail price of about $650.00Be patient people, don't be desperate and overpay for an unlocked iphone 5, IT'S A PHONE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, a phone that will be worth HALF of what you bought it here for in less than a year, yes, BELIEVE that. Don't be foolish.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice improvement over the 4S", "Author": "the Lorax", "ReviewID": "R2K45MQRS06JWS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "New Features:Everyone knows it's lighter and slimmer. Some love it, some think it makes it feel cheap. I carry my phone when I go biking, walking, or running, so I for one welcome the new design. I think the favorite thing for me about the new screen is that it can display an extra row of icons, which means your folders can fit more, and you can have more on one screen. I like to keep everything fitting on one page right there for me to access. The screen is brighter, and color saturation is noticeably better, blacks are blacker, colors are more rich. The phone has LTE which means it will connect to networks faster, and it has 3 microphones, and noise canceling for better audio. The new earbuds are improved (mostly in design, not sound quality) I do wish it came in more colors, but black and white are essential choices, and will do. Hopefully they will bring out more choices, at least Red and Silver.OS/Interface:This is the iOS you know and love. Fundamentally the same, but with new features (Siri, Panoramic Photos, Facetime over 3G) Some people complain that it hasn't changed enough since the first iPhone. It's essentially quite simple, which is the aesthetic that defines Apple. How much has OSX changed in the past 7 years? Not much either. If one wanted to change the style of the icons and fonts, they do have the option to jailbreak. What I like about iOS is that there's only as many menus as there needs to be. With Android you will see redundant menus, and see settings more than once in several menus. Also I was peeved by the back button and the way it serves a different purpose depending on the context. Will pressing it take you back to the apps main menu? Or will it close the app? I dont know! Press it and find out! The fact that they made the iPhone work fundamentally with just the one home button is a feat of itself. Widgets are cool to have, but I always ended up disabling them to conserve battery life and cut down cpu/ram usage. The notification menu, and icon badges suffice for quick indications.Apps:While both Android and iOS have far more apps than any human could sample in a lifetime, what matters most is quality, not quantity. iPhone has all of the best apps at its disposal, many of which do not exist on Android. Games like Infinity Blade II, SF Volt, Chinatown Wars, Fairway Solitaire, music apps like Animoog, DM1, iKaossilator, and Rebirth, and essential apps like iTunes U, Pages, and iMovie. When I switched to Android, I found that there were a lot of great apps I missed that were not on Google Play store. Since i've switched back to iPhone 5, I did not notice any key apps that are on Android but not on iOS.Performance:The first thing I noticed on this new model is how snappy everything is. Tasks are executed fast. Launching apps, pages loading, switching through menus, it does it in a breeze. iOS runs smoothly because it's coded in C, while Android is coded in Java, which has a lot of inefficiencies. I've heard people complain of laggy performance even on the new S4. I believe the overhead of Android's coding is creating a bottleneck, which is why even with a quad core snapdragon, you can still have performance issues. Software is just as important, if not more important, than the hardware. My SamsUniversal Content/Sharing:I have an iPad, and iMac. If I play a game of Vice City on my iPad, I can continue on the same save on my iPhone when I leave my house. If I made a note with some important info on my iMac, i'll have it on my iPad to refer to, no 3rd party apps needed. If I purchase a universal game, I get it on my phone and tablet. If I am having a text conversation with a friend on my iPhone, I can continue on any other device and see all previous messages. Photos and videos are shared among all the devices as well. I also like that I can facetime with all my friends and family who have an iOS device. When I had an Android phone, I couldn't get everyone to create Skype accounts and get the app.Reliability/Warranty:The iPhone has been smooth sailing. With the two Android phones, I had a handful of issues. The phone would often freeze, and I would have to restart. Icons would disappear. Keyboard input lagged. Screen brightness would adjust itself, even though auto brightness was shut off. The only thing i've experienced is the occasional app crashing, which is often the coding of the app itself, not necessarily an iPhone issue.I like knowing that if I have an issue with the phone, I can go to my local Apple store, and they will either fix it, or replace it with a new one there on the spot. With other manufacturers, they either contract their repairs to a 3rd party business, or they require you to go through the RMA process, ship the phone to them, which can take weeks. If you have an issue that can be resolved over the phone, you will be surprised when you call Apple support and have your call answered by a human being, who's a native english speaker from the United States.Other:Being a musician, I like that you have the ability to plug in an instrument (guitar, piano, bass) and use recording, modeling, and effects apps, this opens you up to a whole world of music production. One of the deal breakers with Android is that you can't connect a music instrument due to the latency inherent in the software (maybe this will be resolved in the future). This means apps like GarageBand, Ampkit, Amplitube, JamUP, Nano Studio, are not possible on Android.I also like the aluminum body, and the distinction that it's currently the only phone that's not plastic. The HTC One claims to, but it's actually an overlay, fused with plastic. Another thing I appreciate is the lack of bloatware. iPhones come with a higher percentage of free space than Android phones, and considering that some of the new Android phones don't have SD card slots, it's significant. Some of them even have 7GB of used space out of the box. Also, Apple products have the highest resale value of any brand. If you do end up deciding to sell your phone in the future, you will get more for it.Drawbacks:Screen is smaller than the competing phonesNo SD card slot for expanding storageCamera not equal to some of the other top phonesSpeakers pointing down is not a good designApple Maps still has issuesBattery life could be better (like all smartphones)Design could benefit from a refreshAlso iOS does not have a lot of the software features that the new Android versions have. Some of these features are useful, some of them are more of a novelty that look good on paper, and some you will probably never use. But it's nice to have these options. Being able to choose a different default browser, using hand gestures for phone functions, being able to do multiple attachments for emails, these are the more useful ones.Summary:This phone is what is best for me, but not everyone of course. We all have different tastes, preferences, and uses. For me, it's the integration with my iPad, and iMac, the integration with my friends and family who have iOS devices, and it is the ability to plug in an instrument for practicing, sketching songwriting ideas, and recording riffs. Also, i'm a semi avid gamer, and having access to the best library of games is significant to me. I also value simplicity, reliability, and smooth performance, over options suited for \"power users\". In my humble opinion, iOS is a better experience for me. With the past 2 Android phones, I would get enticed by a new model, enjoy them for a 1-2 month honeymoon period, grow disillusioned by it's shortcomings, then go back to an iPhone. I need to stop doing that, as it's not very cheap!Lastly, I think everyone should try both, before deciding on what platform is best for them. With that said, the iPhone 5 is a good place to start.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPhone 5 versus Samsung glaxy S 4", "Author": "Thomas Alexander", "ReviewID": "R1BKFBANUJJDFC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently switched to Verizon and looked at multiple reviews to help me decide between the Samsung Galaxy S 4 and the iPhone 5. I decided on the iPhone but the person at the counter convinced me that the Galaxy is a better phone and I took it home. I did have a problem in that the Galaxy seemed to come on even though I turned it off at night. I went back and rather than get another S4 I decided to give the iPhone a chance. So now I have experience with both.Firstly I use the phone for fairly basic bread an butter applications: phone, texts, email, calendar, directions and basic apps like yelp, shazam and imdb. So lets go head to head:Phone and sound Quality: This is the main reason I decided to stick with the iPhone. Even though some reviews suggest the sound quality was better with the S4, my experience was the opposite. Though the S4 is louder I found the quality of the sound much better on the iPhone. In fact my old S2 seemed to have a better sound quality than the S4. Call me old fashioned but at the end of the day my primary use of this is still as a phone.Aesthetics: The iPhone hardware looks better but the aesthetics of the software interface was better on the Samsung. In fact when I switched to the iPhone I felt like I was going into withdrawals from the beautiful presentation and the home screens on the S4.Texting: I like the iPhone because I found the voice recognition slightly better. So now I voice most of my texts. I do miss swype when I have to type out my texts.Swype is faster to type (for me)E-mail: Samsung does have the advantage of having different apps for my gmail account and my work e-mail but the difference is superficial. Some may actually like getting all your emails in one app better.Calendar and Contacts: One reason I was nervous about switching to iPhone was that my calendar and contacts are Google based. But the switch was quite easy as I could export my Google contacts to the cloud pretty easily. And this way I only had to keep the contacts I use regularly and leave the rest on my g mail account. The calendar synchronized well though I miss the ultra-cool calendar snippets on the S4.Navigation: Now that Google maps is on the iPhone, no problems there. Just downloaded the app.Overall: The iPhone strikes me as simpler, easier to navigate and sturdier with good voice quality. The S4 is more technologically advanced, more frills, better software interface but also with more bugs. S4 tends to heat up more too.The kicker for me was the better voice quality and I am happy to stay with the iPhone for now.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "It works as what I imagined.", "Author": "Mandy", "ReviewID": "RIV4XB7YU3JF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's unlocked but not brand new..

I finally understand! - hardcore techy - iOS vs Android vs Windows Phone 8", "Author": "Y. Zhou", "ReviewID": "R2GQ4UGM92L0TD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hi there, this is a review from a 22 year old tech enthusiast. The review is quite long, but I have organized them into separate categories, so you don't have to read the whole thing. Here's a little about myself.I am a computer science major, and have always been an Android fan. I've owned:-Nexus 4-Galaxy Nexus-Samsung Galaxy s2-Samsung Note-HTC Amaze-HTC Sensation-HTC Radar-HTC 8x-Many other older modelsNeedless to say, I have had a lot of experience of all three mobile OSes. I am very enthusiastic about tech, always swapping phones, always looking for that perfect phone. I own a macbook air and a custom built gaming desktop PC.Why I chose the iPhone over the HTC One and S4:I am under my stepdad's family plan, so when it was time to upgrade, I had to choose between the HTC One, S4, and iPhone 5. I always thought I would choose the HTC One when it first came out. However, I chose the iPhone 5 mainly because I wanted something new to try. I know that the HTC One and s4 are both great options, but they did not feel like a significant upgrade from a Nexus 4 (which I love). In fact, they seemed slower than the Nexus 4 in everyday tasks (most likely from fragmentation from HTC/Samsung overlays AND carrier apps). The HTC One has much better hardware than the Nexus 4, but there is a definitely lag in the OS due to the fragmentation. Samsung S4 does a much better job with their software, but I hate their plastic feel. IMHO, I like the overall package that the Nexus 4 gives you, which is high quality in both software and hardware. So because I felt my Nexus 4 is better than both the One and S4, I decided to try out the iPhone 5.What I think of Android:I absolutely love the Nexus 4 and the Galaxy Nexus, but I HATE every other Android phones. The fragmentation just makes the entire experience a chore. I spent so much time installing custom mods. Most of the phones had major shortcomings (no/late updates, battery life, intense lag, etc). To fix the software shortcomings, you would have to know how to mod, then research the best mods for you specific phone model, and update the mods when the \"cook\" for the mod release a new version. Furthermore, the mods you install would oftentimes have bugs of it's own. It just seems in order to enjoy non-Nexus android phones, you have to be willing to spend the time on the phone. To me, that's bull****. I don't want to spend time on a phone, I have other stuff to do. A phone should make your life simpler, not the other way around. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the Nexus 4, the only shortcoming I see it having is it doesn't have LTE and the glass back cracks easily. I'm not bashing on android, in fact there are a lot of things in android that I love which I can't do in iOS (torrents and file management to name a couple). Android also syncs well with both PC and Mac because of the file management system, and that most of its information is stored in the cloud. But the main idea here is that Android is cluttered with too many information and overlay skins (except for the Nexus phones), major drawbacks (whether it be software or hardware), and complicated. Nexus phones on the other hand, ha great hardware and software. No overlay skins or carrier apps, just pure android. Simple. If you like android, get a Nexus device.What I think of Windows Phone 8:Two words. Too young. The apps are noticeable worse than the Android and iOS counterparts. The Youtube app was downright frustrating to use. I think Microsoft is going in the right direction, giving the PC and phone a similar feel and integrating them together, but as of right now, they are still behind the curve. It syncs well with Windows 8 PC, so it is simple to use, but the apps right now are simply trash. Windows Phone feels more like iOS than android because they made it very simple to use and also limiting.What I think of iOS:Simplicity. Sometimes a little too simple (simple wifi toggles are impossible, will change in iOS 7). To an advanced user like me, it also feels constricted. I can't just drag a movie file into the iphone, I have to convert the movie file into a file that iTunes accept, then sync iTunes with iPhone. However, I do think iTunes is a pro because it is kind of like the command center of your iOS devices, where everything is located in one location, something I wish Google will work on. iOS is also very fluid. It is noticeable more fluid than the HTC One and S4, but less so with the Nexus 4. But mainly, the feeling you get with iOS is simplicity. For example, let's look at the camera app. It doesn't give you as many options as the HTC One camera app, but that's just how I like it. The options the iPhone camera let you change are the options I actually understand, I have no idea most of what the HTC One camera option even do. This can relate to almost everything on iOS. It doesn't give you a lot of options, which equates to less clutter. The options they give you are options you understand and actually use. Simple simple simple. iOS also syncs very well with other Apple products, and decently well with Windows PC through iTunes.iPhone 5 vs Nexus 4 (HARDWARE only):I'll be comparing the iPhone 5 to my favorite phone of all time (yes even more than the HTC One as explained above), Nexus 4. The iPhone have a better quality screen, better camera, better speakers, better built quality, slightly better battery life, LTE support, better call quality (3 mikes), physical camera button (volume up). The Nexus 4 have better grips, smoother touchscreen (slippery), bigger screen, faster processor and more RAM (though that doesn't matter in real life), smaller bezel. The screen is smaller on the iPhone, which many see as a con, but I know that my girlfriend actually prefers a smaller screen because she likes smaller phones (more pocketable...her words). I also enjoy having a change of pace with the smaller display, I can actually operate the phone with one hand, and it's a lot less noticeable in my pocket. In general, the iPhone 5 is better hardware-wise.iPhone 5 vs Nexus 4 (SOFTWARE only):A lot of the shortcomings for Android phones are not on the Nexus 4. The Nexus 4 is always updated with the latest software from Google, and it's super fluid. It doesn't have any HTC/Samsung/Motorola overlays, or carrier-forced apps. Most importantly, pure android feels simple. Something Google needs to work on is something similar to iTunes, a central program that keeps all the data of your phone and organizes them in a computer. I also absolutely LOVE the software \"back, home, menu\" buttons. This is absolutely genius when the first introduced it on the Galaxy Nexus. This allows the phone to give you a wider screen real-estate when you watch videos, and allowing the phone to have a smaller bezel. iOS on the other hand feels even simpler, sometimes to a fault. Like I said earlier, transferring movies onto the iPhone seems like a chore, but it does stay in the iTunes library for the future, so it's not too bad. Apple's multitasking can be oftentimes more limiting than android, but it does save battery life. I am a very big supporter of Apple's hardware and software optimization. Apple makes most of their hardware and all of their software, and they do it in a way that makes them work so well together. The iphone 5's power is probably half as powerful as the Nexus 4 spec-wise, but it runs as fluid if not more fluid than the Nexus 4. Siri versus Google Now is also something to compare, but to me they are both great options (much better than s-voice at least). Overall, android on the Nexus 4 has a slight advantage over iOS in my opinion, but iOS is more simpler and organized.  This really depends on personal preference.iPhone 5 Impressions:After using the phone for about a week, I have not had any major issues or see any major drawbacks. The phone is simple and problem free. This is in no way of saying the iPhone is perfect, it's far from it. With my previous phones (excluding Nexus 4), I've always found major drawbacks that I simply can't live with, which explains why I switched phones so many times until I got the Nexus 4, which I've stayed with for the longest. The iPhone provides fantastic and beautiful hardware, optimized and simple software, and wraps them up together into a great experience. I also know that they will keep me updated with the latest softwares, unlike non-Nexus android phones. The limitations on iOS does give me some issues as an advanced user, BUT honestly, it doesn't bother me that much, simply because I don't do many advanced things on my phone anyways. The screen is a change of pace to me also, but I do enjoy using the phone in one hand, it's a much better fit. To me, Apple gives me the impression that it doesn't do anything perfectly, but it does do everything very very well.Conclusion:Do I recommend the iPhone 5? Well, how much money do you have? If money is not an issue, go for it. If money is an issue, buy the Nexus 4. Both phones will give you a great experience. Buy the HTC One or S4 if you absolutely want a 1080p display and LTE and hate the limitations of iOS, but just know their software updates are usually months late, and sometimes will never come, and you will have a very cluttered experience. Don't buy a Windows 8 phone unless you have a very specific reason to do so.I know of the Android vs iOS flame war that goes on even today, but it really boils down to personal preference. I've been on the Android ship for a long time, because Android allows me to do more stuff on my phone. But now that I've used so many different phones, I realize I don't use my phone to do anything advanced, I save that stuff for my computer. I realize I need a phone that doesn't need me to provide maintenance and troubleshoot. I need a phone that simplifies my life. I need a phone that does everything well. Both the iPhone 5 and Nexus 4 does it. Simplicity sells, and that is one thing that Apple and Google understands. Samsung and HTC has much to learn.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:After using the iPhone for a little longer, I can say that there are some gripes I have against it, but also some positives.CONS:-Most of my complaints stems from the lack of file management. For example I can't download a file from my email, only view it.-I miss swype-Watching videos on a 4-inch screen does seem constricting at first, but I got used to it.-When using android, there usually is always a setting I can find that would solve whatever that's bothering me, whether it's an android setting or app setting. On iOS, many times I can't find those settings.-Android notifications seem better.PROS:-I thought my Nexus 4 had a beautiful screen, but after using the iPhone 5 and going back to the Nexus 4 to try it out, I find the Nexus 4's color washed out and inaccurate. The iPhone 5 has a gorgeous screen. Nexus 4 also seems super fat now lol.-iTunes keeps me organized, and also backs my iPhone's data up. Nice to see coming from android.-The size of the iPhone really does feel great in one hand. Most of the 4.7\"+ android phones feel constricting simply because you need both your hands free to do most tasks, especially on the Galaxy Notes.-The \"reader\" feature on Safari is fantastic-The \"do not disturb\" feature is more useful than I thought.-Once again, the iPhone reiterates to me that it doesn't do anything perfectly, but it does everything well.ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS:Google just added the HTC One and S4 Google Edition phones on their Play Store. To summarize, both are running pure android, thus I think they're better. HOWEVER, because Google wasn't the one who made the hardware for these phones, the pure android software isn't optimized on the phones yet. For example, most tasks seem faster on the skinned version of the phones. The IR Blaster on the HTC One also doesn't work as of right now. Small things like this makes me hesitant to pay $600 for them right now. I rather wait for the next Nexus device.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "####", "Author": "Tolo", "ReviewID": "R1B89ZTNTL77H9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a lot of trouble buying that phone, when u read on the description parts , it said unlock but it wasn't", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Big Letdown", "Author": "KarlDC", "ReviewID": "R30GRIBARSWYWH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this one less than a year and in that time the ability to use wifi and bluetooth have grayed out and now its completely dead.

After installing iOS 6.1 on my new iPhone everything went smoothly. I love the iPhone 5 and all it has to offer, especially the ability to use AirPlay.

This is my first time because I was so disappointed about my iPhone 5. I am a huge fan of iPhone and never go with anything else. I am using a MacBook Pro, and owned a MacBook Air. I was excited to wait for iPhone 5. First, I love the new design. The weight is light, and the phone looks just so elegant compare to the 4 and 4S. I love the white color, and of course, the screen and its contrast is much better than the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (my hubby using the Note 2, switched from iPhone 4S). So, 2 stars because of the design. The disappointed part came from the signal. I got no wi-fi signal in my house, although I stand next to my router. My 4 and the Note 2 got full bar of signal. But that's not the end of the story. Last week I had some follow up with my dentist and my doctor. None of them could get a hold of me. They even asked me, when I called back, which is the good number to call me because they'd tried so many time but got my voice mail (and if the voice mail is from the morning, it will never show up in my phone until afternoon or late evening). Guess what, there was no signal/no service in my office which never happened to my iPhone 4 nor the Note 2, or any other phone everyone used in there. Only 2 people did not have any signal at all, me and my boss who just got the iPhone 5 as well. No wi-fi, no service, and no 4G. I felt like I was isolated in an island during 9 hours at work a day. Not that, the signal got lost when I was on the road, too.I went to Apple store thinking of exchanging another phone, so I brought the 4 and Note 2 with me just showing them I got issue with signal, not that I want something \"new in the box\" for re-sales or anything. They told me it's a known issue and all the phone would be the same. We did a test. 5 Apple staff carried 5 iPhone 5 and me stepping out of the store. We all stood like 3-4 stores from the Apple store. Guess what? None of their iPhone 5 got any wi-fi signal nor the 4G works. My iPhone 5 got 1 bar, but it went on and off, my 4 got 2 bars, and the Samsung Note got full bar! So they proved to me nothing was wrong with my phone. I even got some sort of signal while they did not at all.I am back to my iPhone 4 now and returned the 5. AT&T; tried to sell me the Galaxy S3, but because I always support Apple, I did not want to use Samsung. Since I am back to iPhone 4, I got service, signal, 3G, wi-fi.. everything in my office, at the gym, at home, or anywhere I go.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Problem", "Author": "qq", "ReviewID": "R1UN0QQKA2SUT3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had to return this item (dead phone).

The design of the system is not perfect, but nonetheless it gets the job done quickly and without hassle. In a mobile communications device you expect two main things, one of which is consistency in operation. My iphone 5 does that well, If i need to make a phone call it gives me ways to do that quickly. Even while im in a call the options to hold, remind, and merge calls is fantastic. Simple tasks that i felt android and blackberry made too difficult. On the hardware side of things my iphone can handle most multimedia applications with no problem, and the retina screen makes them that much more enjoyable. Some say that the OS is restrictive, that is true but with restriction you gain consistency and the peace of mind knowing things that are meant for the iphone will just work. Apple has come a long way from the original iphone that lacked even MMS. With iMessage, your messages are synced across iDevices and make for sms between iDevices flawless. Except, when the service is down, which has happened several times over the past few months. Even with this the iphone can switch to regular text messaging. The camera on the iphone is nice, still doesnt replace a dedicated camera, but for something that you put in your pocket, it does the job really well. My only gripe would be the materials used to manufacture the 5. The anodized aluminum is prone to scratching and necessitates a case. I got mine from amazon for only $9. And it only adds ~4mm of thickness and my iphone looks brand new after a little over 2 months of constant use. Battery life is acceptable, putting my late Epic 4g to shame by lasting a constant 18-20 hours on a single charge with an average of 7-8hrs of constant use. Overall i give this phone 4 out of 5 stars as the material it is made with is prone to scratching, but honestly that is my only gripe.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "wrong discreption", "Author": "Amr", "ReviewID": "R1AO91AIYAZ5EM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "they said on the title ''Apple iPhone 5 16GB (White) - Unlocked (used)'' but what I received was NOT UNLOCKED, and after contacting the seller they said in the description was written the phone is not locked.

I decided to purchase the IPhone 5 considering that it is an Apple product and I would like to give it a try. However, I am sad to say that my expectations have been over-estimated.- The Iphone couldn't transfer contacts stored on my SIM card to the phoneConsidering that my two previous phones, the Note 1 and the Touch Pro 2, could do it, I am puzzled as to why I am deprived of as a basic function. I ended up having to place my SIM card back into my Note 1, transfer the contacts onto my Note, and use the \"Bump\" application to transfer the contacts to my Iphone. The fact that I have to rely on a third party application and my old Android phone for such a basic task disappoints me.- Poor file management and storage place utilizationI am expecting Itunes to be an optional tool for PC file transfer, much like Samsung Kies. And I was wrong. You MUST use Itunes! It might be trivial to some of you but I expect file transfer to be as easy as dragging and dropping the files into another window without the use of an extra programme, something that my old Windows CE Touch Pro 2 could do. Also, I realize that opening a music or video file in another app would result in the file being copied! Why is it that IOS saw the need to have 2 copies of the same file to be played in 2 different apps is beyond me. That is a poor utilization of storage space.- Lower quality video playback appsI love watching videos on my Iphone when I am traveling to and from my workplace. It seems that the video playback apps on IOS isn't as good as Android's. I have DicePlayer installed on my Note and Goodplayer and Aceplayer installed on Iphone. These apps are known to be one of the best on both Android and IOS respectively. File formats that I have problems playing on the IPhone, I have no problem playing them on the Note 1. Although it is to be noted this is my observation on video playback apps, I wonder if this is the case of IOS apps in general: Quantity over quality.I could go on about the camera and other aspects.To cut the review short, I ended up returning to my 2.5 years old Galaxy Note 1 after a couple of months. The fact that the new IPhone 5 has problem topping my old Note 1 greatly bothers me because I paid good money for it.

The Apple brand not only brings a professional quality to your life but also provides numerous outlets for support while allowing you to protect your information with free software updates and virus protection. The iPhone 5 has become one of the most well known phones and has made an impact, not only on the smartphone market, but also on everyday consumers that have purchased one. Once you have tried using the iPhone 5 it is easy to see why it has an edge on all of the other competitors. The numerous reasons why the iPhone 5 is so popular and common is because of the user friendly software and unique features that are preinstalled and the availability of almost anything your mind can imagine. The iCloud is a great feature included with the iPhone 5. The iCloud feature is part of the iOS software system that comes with your iPhone 5. You are able to also download iCloud on other Apple devices you own and can save and access any data uploaded to the Cloud from any of your devices. With iCloud your files are saved on Apple's servers which are similar to using an online e-mail, only you can save so much more than text documents. If you are using iCloud with your Apple devices then your information is automatically saved when you are in range of wi-fi services. The reason this is important is because if you accidentally delete a file you need you can go into iCloud and retrieve the file. This makes sure you don't have to worry about losing the information on your phone. With iCloud you can now save time and space on your devices without having to worry about tedious file transfers between your phone and your computer. Another option with iCloud is being able to have your music with you whenever you need it, no matter what Apple device you are currently on. When deciding if the Iphone 5 is the smart-phone for you iCloud is just one of the features that makes that decision easier.Another fantastic option the iPhone 5 offers is its panorama feature in the camera setting. Panorama is defined in many phrases such as, unbroken view, whole region, and wide view. It now allows the user to take multiple pictures and the iPhone will put it all together into one larger scaled photo. For example if you are taking a picture of a bridge and you want to capture the entire architecture, you can. When you open the camera application on the phone, select options and tap on \"Panorama\", once the setting has been applied you can take the entire picture. The option allows for you to scroll the phone left to right and as you do so the iPhone is taking multiple pictures and combining them into one large image. FaceTime is an amazing feature that is preinstalled on your iPhone 5, no need to set up a special account or screen name, which saves you time right from the beginning. The Facetime feature allows you to make video calls with anyone you choose and the iPhone's front facing camera allows for your friends and family to see you while you chat with them. Apple's software makes using the Facetime feature flow seamlessly with calls by allowing you to just tap a button while in a phone call and switching to Facetime. This feature can even be utilized in the corporate environment with conference calls, saving your company time and money. And now Facetime can be used anywhere, with Apple updating the app so that you can stream your video calls over your cellular service and are not limited to just using wi-fi. Features like Facetime can help add the finishing touch to your decision on purchasing an iPhone.  In today's market there are so many choices with smartphones that it can be difficult to make a decision. When doing research on the top selling phones on the market the iPhone 5 stands out with more apps, features and overall performance. Other phones like the iPhone's leading competitor, the Samsung Galaxy S3 have some features that are not included with the Iphone 5. For starters, the Galaxy S3 has different software and therefore doesn't make you conform to Apple's unique methods of use. Also, some features, like the popular \"S-beam\", allows you to transfer files with the tap of your Galaxy S3 phone to another Galaxy S3 phone, which brings file sharing to a whole new level. While you can get this feature on your iPhone 5 with an app created to do this, some people like the convenience of having it pre-set and not having to worry about downloading an app.  Another feature that can be troublesome with the iPhone 5 is that the battery cannot be easily changed out for a new one when it does not hold a charge as well as it once did (and changing the battery voids your warranty). Phones like the Galaxy S3 do allow for the capability to change out their batteries so you can have consistent battery power when you need it.  The pros of the iPhone 5 seem to outweigh the cons of the Galaxy S3 but it all depends on what you want in a phone.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wifi problem", "Author": "Ozan", "ReviewID": "RL4TV8ACKOFCV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone does not connect the wifi network.

Here's how:1. You know those moments when you're with other people, and they're talking to each other, and you're expected to pay attention to the conversation and chime in with feigned interest?  So much effort for so little reward.  You needn't fret any longer. With your face glued to this sleekly designed piece of commercial divinity, you can comfortably and constantly interact socially with internet identities in ways that are far less intellectually stimulating, all the while implying to the people around you that you have lots of other friends incessantly vying for your time.  The iPhone 5 makes it simpler than ever before to avoid all the awkward social interactions that exist in the obsolete physical world.2. Remember the days when you needed to ask another person for directions to find your desired destination in a foreign place?  You might've even needed to ask a local if they had a recommendation for a good restaurant.  This inefficient, and potentially dangerous, networking is wiped away like crud on your windshield with the iPhone 5.  You can just use the Siri function instead.  Gone are the days of uncertainty where you let the ambience of a town guide you to some unexpected, and most-likely unsatisfactory, destination.  Now, you can find whatever safe commercialized nirvana you like through a calculated Google search, all without putting down your Big Mac and Coke.3. Not even two decades ago, it was commonplace for people to rely principally on their memory to recall an experience of one great spectacle of our society or another.  This is not the case anymore.  Your child's taking their first steps?  Well, you'd better take out your iPhone 5, and utilize the cutting edge HD video capture technology (and 8MP camera!).  You may never see that once in a lifetime experience with your own eyes, but at least your digital brain will have the memory stored forever.If you're anything like me you'll love these optimal features and more when you purchase the iPhone 5 today.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "New stuff has little good and plenty of bad.", "Author": "W.

I am writing a lot more in comparison rather than re-introduce you to iPhone again, so most of my points are in comparison to the previous, the 4S.Better Speakers and Microphones:It has 3 mics now which are in front, back and bottom. The voice memo turns out to be a lot clearer, and sounds delivering to your caller is much improved as well. It does help on the Facetime sessions. More mics also mean that elimination of more noise and much noise-cancellation too.Faster, Period:The iPhone 5 is definitely faster than the 4S. Units are put in comparison and it does slide smoother and faster. I used to turn on so many apps and always forgot to close them until my phone become so slow. I haven't quite had the need to close the apps like I used to.New lightning connector is cool, and easy to plug:I have had bad luck with the old dock connector. At one point I ruined the connector of the old 3GS due to force connection to it. 2 of the pins broken so I have to sent to Apple for warranty. With the new lightning, you can connector front or back or it does not matter. It fits on either side so it is a Great improvement! However be prepared to pay more as they are no generic available yet, so make sure you keep yours with care for now!Better front facing camera:The front camera is now 720p, which deliver clearer video to your Facetime caller, or improving your photo quality for those of you who like to take self-portrait. The back camera is the same as 4S though, which is a 8MP with flash. The latest iOS6 enables panoramic photo-taking, which is my favorite!", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Still the best  there is", "Author": "Hsmog", "ReviewID": "RB4UET70JGX6B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned an iPhone 3G (scratches easily), iPhone 4 (a game changer), and an iPhone 5. Before anyone thinks I'm an Apple fanboy, I'm not. I found iOS to be restrictive and difficult to customize without jailbreaking it, so I sold my iPhone 4 and bought one of the best Android phones at the time - a Samsung Galaxy S2 (which started having hardware/software problems about a year later). The iPhone 5 has features that ultimately trump all other phones out there on the market, and it's pros far outweigh its cons.The iPhone 5 is by far the most reliable phone I've ever owned. The hardware is second to none. The glass on the front is strong enough that I've never used a screen protector on it. I've thrown it in a bag with other electronics and I never had to worry about the face of the phone getting scratched, as long as you don't put it in your pocket with sharp objects like a bunch of keys and  play rugby. However, you'll need a cover for the back of the phone because it may still get scratched when you place it on a table and push it across the surface. You'll also need to take care of the camera lens because that may get scratched unlike the glass on the front.I've dropped all of my iPhones every now and then, but they all continued to work well afterwards. With the iPhone 5, I dropped it several times from waist level onto hard tiles and the worst result was a barely noticeable dent in the aluminum on the side of the phone, but otherwise this thing is build like a brick. I've never had a problems with the battery or anything rattling on the inside of the phone after damaging it, iOS never skipped a beat. The hardware rather than the software is what brings me back to Apple. I can't say that about the cheap, plastic and brittle hardware of Android phones (in my experience, the plastic chips easily, the camera is very sensitive to shocks, and the software will go crazy like rebooting on its own at random times). You won't need to buy replacement parts that are outrageously expensive (i.e. a genuine Samsung battery cover made of thin plastic will blow your mind). The screen resolution continues to be clear, crisp, bright, and hands down better than any Android phone.Consumers may be purchasing bigger phones including near iPad size phablets, but I commend Apple to sticking to its guns on keeping the size phone relatively the same. With bigger phones like the Samsung Note 2, you'll have to use both hands to make selections on the screen, especially if you need to tap something on the far edge of the screen. With the iPhone 5, you don't need humongous hands or Slender Man fingers to navigate the screen. It fits perfectly in your palm and fits in any pocket easily compared to the bigger phones out there.I have to say that iOS copied some of its improvements from Android to make it better and there is still room to improve. You can't customize settings shortcuts and trying to turn a feature on or off feels like you have to navigate through a maze of menu choices until you finally get to where you want to be. You can place a bunch of apps in a folder but only the first 9 apps are visible unless you open the folder and swipe around. Apple continues to have the best apps available through the app store.Another downside is the fact that you have to buy authorized 3rd party charging docks/cables in order to charge the phone. I've had some cheap but reliable charging cords that I bought online, but those failed to work when news broke of a consumer's phone exploding (or was it burning?) after overcharging it with an unlicensed 3rd party accessory. Authorized aftermarket accessories tend to be less competitively priced and are priced toward the more expensive end.All in all, the iPhone 5 continues to be one, if not the best, of all the smartphones out there today.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent product.

The phone to the ear feature is also frustrating, since it does not work every time. So it is best to forget that this feature even exists. I do not understand why would Apple make a feature that would not work every time. It just makes the feature a pain to use.

The Iphone 5 weighs only 3.9oz while the Iphone 4S weighs 4.9oz; Apple has finally moved up from its usual 3.5-inch display and moved onto a 4-inch on the Iphone 5. Apple has not only made the Iphone 5 look slimmer but faster software wise. Apple went above and beyond with the IOS6 software, such as having the ability to reply to a text message when you don't want to take a call, or have a Do Not Disturb mode where you can set a time when only certain people can contact you. They say you can keep the best for last but since the Iphone has such great features one of the best is Siri. It\u2019s now more developed, Siri has learned a bit more in 2013, as this voice-recognition system with spoken responses can now get sports statistics and let you know when the next time the Lakers are playing.

The color gives it a sharp clean look.The screen resolution is pretty awesome! Its very easy to use and navigate.There are over 900,000 games and apps in the app store you can pay for for, lots are also free. iOS 7 makes the iPhone 5 even easier to use. iOS 7's new taskbar lets you turn off your wifi or bluetooth, control you portrait rotation and turn on the iPhones flashlight. I also re-designs all of the apps on your Iphone. If you are going to buy the Iphone and plan on downloading lots of stuff (movies, music, games, etc) then you might want consider buying an Iphone with more space. The Iphone 5 hard drives come in 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB. The recently released Iphone 5S only has few upgrades from the the iPhone 5, Including a little bit faster phone. Even though the iphone 5 is extremely fast already. It also has a fingerprint scanner which is pretty cool, But not worth the price.Pros:  Cons:Lightweight  Take A Long Time To Turn OnEasy To Use  16 GB Is Too Small (Can Upgrade)Very Nice Clean LookGood Battery LifeFast ChargingGood Sound QualityGreat Picture QualityOverall This Is A Great Phone!", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "iphone 5", "Author": "Andrea Orosco Cardoso", "ReviewID": "R2OW8NCU67NMVF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it was good ! it complied with all the characteristics  and quality i expected ..i liked it very much", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Iphone 5", "Author": "larsen7pr", "ReviewID": "R3088758SHX184", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first saw the Iphone 5 it seemed stupid because I thought it was the exact same thing as the 4. I later realized that the 5 is way better! Some people say that it is not worth the money, but in my opinion I think it is. It is nothing like the 4! It is super light and really skinny! The 5 is bigger but that's one thing I like about it! I really like all of the cute cases and accessories and everything you can buy to go with it. The Iphone 5 works really well and it's also fast. I really like the 5 and if you are looking for a good and fast phone I suggest you get it!When I used the Iphone 5, I became addicted to it. Some people ask me \"what's the difference between an Iphone 4 and a Iphone 5?\" Well, it's longer and thinner, which makes the screen longer. Theres also the lightning charger, which makes the charger fit into the plug-in on the phone both ways. On the Iphone 5 the back isn't glass like the Iphone 4, It's titanium which prevents the back from breaking.I recomend the Iphone 5 to anyone who drops their phone often. I dropped my Iphone 5 in the toilet once, everything still works fine.

I am glad I chose to purchase the white IPhone 5. It has fast internet connection, long lasting battery life, tons of cool features and apps, plus it's also lightweight for easier use. When I first turned on my IPhone, I immediately figured out how to use it. My IPhone was very easy to navigate and download new apps. I would recommend this phone for anyone eleven years or older. The only problem I ever had with my phone, was with the computer iTunes program. It was slow, and hard to figure out how to sync my new purchases onto my IPhone. However, my IPhone 5 was much better than my sister's IPhone 4s model. It has faster internet connection, and sends texts faster. Plus it has a bigger screen, with longer lasting battery life.

This phone has something for everyone.  It is the Swiss army knife of cell phones. It serves as business and entertainment in one small device.  I no longer have to be stuck at home if I want to check important emails or surf on the internet. One main feature every phone should have is great reception, and the Iphone has it. The slim design, along with being light-weight, makes it easy to hold in your hand. This phone is also durable.  I have dropped mine a few times and it incurred no damage.  This phone has an excellent display, and although the speakers appear to be small in size they are not small in sound. The sound is full bodied and crisp adding to the multimedia experience. With ample battery life, the Iphone 5 gives you a whole day of use before it needs a quick charge.  It has a built in HD camera/video recorder to capture all of life's precious moments when you least expect it.  The Iphone's  front facing camera makes it convenient to take self portraits and simple to pose with your friends or family without the need of  another photographer. Since the device is so popular, many apps are available and are often free.  Facetime is built into the phone and allows you to see the person you are talking to if they have a phone with the same capabilities.  This is great for people who are away from home for extended periods of time.  Some other major apps, are Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube.  If you have children, several game apps come in handy to keep them occupied while you are busy. This phone is great for the on the go businessman and frequent travelers.  With access to a 4G network, you can obtain directions using Google maps. Siri, the name for the artificial intelligence, in the form of a female voice, makes it possible to use your phone hands free. This gives feel of having your own personal assistant. To activate simply push a button and tell Siri what you want her to do.  You can use Siri to send text messages, activate programs, or you can even ask her silly questions and she will reply.  She knows my birthday!  Another feature is the ability to use Bluetooth in sync with your vehicle or other Bluetooth compatible devices. The Iphone 5 was the top selling smart phone for the year 2012, and the Iphone in general tops sales over other smart phone devices.  In the first weekend the Iphone came out, over a million were sold.  This phone is compatible, user friendly and great for all age groups.  The number of sales speaks for itself.  Can all of these people be wrong?  If you are looking for a dependable phone, that is worth your money than the Iphone 5 is all you need.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thanks", "Author": "Vijay Gurung", "ReviewID": "R3KB7OLN8CQ1G3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi, thanks for sending fast this iphoneI love it it's very nice comfortable to playBecouse it's slim i love it fast to use i didNot see like this fast iphone is the bestThanks", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thank you!", "Author": "Jenine M.", "ReviewID": "R1HASGUVPEP29A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone arrived on time.

If like me you have owned and continue to own previous versions of iPhones, iPods and iPads, and have several chargers, Docks, car connectors and car chargers etc then this new design is really frustrating.The real reason that Apple changed the design is surely so that everybody has to go out and buy outrageously overpriced adaptors or new leads. I have read that Apple pays less than $0.6 for these leads, yet charges it's customers \u00a325.Apple have also put a microchip in their leads that the iPhone is set to recognise, without which they are rejected by the iPhone in order to prevent third party manufacturers from producing leads that work properly, hence all the terrible reviews for these 3rd party products.It's just another of Apple's underhand money making exercises at the customers considerable inconvenience and expense.It's taller than the iPhone 4s. Some may like this, but I don't. The 4s sits comfortably in your hand and my thumb can reach the top of the screen on the 4s without having to change the position in my hand. I have bigger than average hands too.It is faster than the 4s, only a little, but it is faster. But this is the only improvement in my eyes.Battery life is poor, another sacrifice made to the god of (pointless) thinness. It feels cheaper and flimsier than the 4s too.Maps are a mess. Google maps was so much better on the 4 and 4s.Instead of this ridiculous connector fiasco, why couldn't we have kept the old and perfectly good connector and had wireless charging too? The technology is there, and would be a great improvement over the current system.A more robust design would be nice so that they didn't have to live in cases, and a dust and moisture resistant design would be very welcome.iCloud is fantastic, and so I can't imagine changing phones to another manufacturer until someone else comes out with something at least as good as iCloud.But when they do, I'll be more than happy to switch allegiance, despite twenty years as a loyal Apple customer.Apple can only push their customers so far, and I'm becoming more and more fed up with the way Apple is treating it's customers with regard to their infuriating thinness campaign with their phones, iPads, MacBook Pros and iMacs, at the expense of functionality and in a blatant attempt to corner the market and limit customers buying choices in terms of leads, adaptors, connections, music purchasing, app purchasing etc, as are many many other people.Apple is a great brand and has produced many fantastic products, but the iPhone 5 is not the leap ahead from the 4s that customers had hoped for, and this coupled with frustration and expense incurred by the connector design and the thinness over battery life and durability make it for me a 2 star product.If you own the 4s I'd suggest hanging on to it and waiting until Autumn for the next hopefully much improved iPhone, or Samsung, or whoever the Apple slayer will be.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfect", "Author": "Arbnor Ajvazi", "ReviewID": "RT2MSTPCZFTDV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "just the way i expected to be , brand new with everything, every thing works perfect factory unlocked as it was on description, just perfect", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exelente", "Author": "RICHARD SILVA CLIENTE JJ N\u00ba 13160", "ReviewID": "R22VOI08RHIQLC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exelente vendedor, exelente producto, puntual con el envio, telefono nuevo y liberado como lo describe el vendedor...

After two months of regular use, it still appears to be new. The screen is fingerprint resistant unlike many of the past iPhones. The camera is excellent (not to say that past iPhone's haven't been able to take good images). It can take panoramas--a very well done effort by Apple to take existing ideas from third party applications and perfect them. The main disadvantage of the iPhone 5 is the lack of good maps support.

I bought it via AT&T; for the upgrade price of $199.  So price is not the issue here.Love the phone.  Hate the battery life.  I'm on my 2nd phone and something clearly is wrong.  There are loads of people complaining about the battery life on the Apple support forums.  It is not clear yet whether it is a hardware or iOS problem, but I can say for sure that this phone does not get HALF the battery life my iPhone 4 had....and I have \"babyed\" it by completely draining the battery and re-charging, turning off WiFI when not in use, turning off LTE & bluetooth when not in use, turning off iCloud passport, turning off email push notifications, NONE of which I had to do on the 4 (except the 4 didn't have passport or LTE).  But still, you get the idea.Apple claims the longer battery life is one of the bonuses of this phone.  Nothing could be further than the truth for me and many users.  I personally have spoken to 4 people who have the issue.  Another handful report not having the issue which is good.  But 50:50 rate of success is too poor a ratio IMO.I've spent somewhere around 16 hours troubleshooting this with Apple, taking my first one in for a new phone, setting up a new phone for the 2nd time FROM SCRATCH and  believe me I'm not happy about this.  I've set up twice as new, done hard boots, you name it with tech support.And still, today I surfed Facebook a bit, made a few calls totalling no more than 5 minutes.  The phone Usage indicator says I used the phone for more than 5 hours!!! Impossible.  Charge was at 100% this morning and with that small amount of use...really...totalling less than one hour...I'm at 10% battery.While the AppleCare representatives are all polite and knowledgeable, I find it especially hard to stomach the scripts they are all taught to say...basically discounting the trouble you are having.  You can tell they HAVE to say these things.I really hope hubris doesn't undo Apple, but if this iPhone5 issue and the Apple Maps fiasco is any indicator, they are really on their way down.  I read a Wall Street Journal article today regarding the gains Amazon, Samsung and Google are making on Apple.I don't want to see Apple fail because I really like their products.  I think they need to get a clue when it comes to not making their customers PAY THEM to BETA TEST.  My rate is $29.00/hr.  At that rate by my caluclations, they owe me a full refund plus some hourly wages for all the work I've put into this...and STILL NO SUCCESS.  For all my trouble I am actually going to ask them for a credit to my account and yeah you can just go on laughing...me too.  But I'm going to ask.If I hadn't already passed my 4 onto my son I would take it back.  The only reason I upgraded in the first place is because I don't like using a smartphone out of warranty -- too afraid of data loss.  So I went for the 5.BOO HISS APPLE.In sum, here's my advice:  If you have already bought one and your battery life is not good...take it back and keep taking it back until you get a good one.  MAKE SURE THE BATTERY CHARGE IS AT 100% OUT OF THE BOX when you first charge it up.  IF NOT, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND ASK FOR ANOTHER PHONE THAT HAS A 100% CHARGE.  There is anecdotal evidence that the ones that are not showing up in the box at 100% are the problem phones.SECONDLY, IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY TAKEN THE PLUNGE ON THE iPHONE 5, WAIT 6 MONTHS UNTIL (IF) APPLE RESOLVES THIS PROBLEM.  The rate of poor battery reports is too high to take the risk, IMO.Hope this helps,**UPDATE***Next day: after talking with Apple Care last night and getting approval, went to the Apple Store today and swapped out the phone for a new one (which was 66% charged out of the box).  The guy at the Genius Bar said he thinks its the apps I was using responsible for the battery life. (I had a lot of them on my 4 and the same ones on the 5).  He said the apps may have not caught up to the new iOS yet.  I'll leave the discussion on who I think is to blame for that for another time.  At any rate he came up with 3 or 4 apps from the log which showed crashes.  He asked me to restore the phone from new (again) and rebuild it.We left the Apple store and the battery was at 66%.  We drove across the highway to another store.  Before we could even go in the store the battery had gone to 61%.  We turned around and went back to the Apple Store in the mall.  By that time the battery was at 59%.Mind you, none of my apps were on this phone.  They had just set it up.  Talked with a technician and he said it is fine to have 66% battery new in the box and that this sort of battery life loss (7% within 10 minutes) was to be expected on a new phone.  He said when I charged it up again it should do better.  OK I'm skeptical, but will report back.Meanwhile here I go rebuilding a phone again.One thing I can say is that at least I'm becoming more convinced that this is a software issue and not a hardware issue.  A combination of iOS 6 and also apps that iO6 no longer likes (thank you Apple).Also today on Facebook I had two people reply to my post about this that they had new iPhones and their battery was dying before the end of the day.  They were suprised at the poor battery life.  I also had a friend with a relatively new 4S say the same thing...which leads me to believe it is Apple's new OS that is causing these problems.My last strategy if it doesn't get better is to wipe almost all apps off the phone and just use it as a dumb phone.  With a beautiful screen.  Hopefully it won't get to that point.

Apple needs to stop worrying about making the phone thinner and lighter, and rather add innovation back to the phone like inductive charging or an all day battery.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cool", "Author": "Amanda C\u00e1rdenas", "ReviewID": "R2Z3CON4Y4AYPO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the phoneis the best phone I've had , and arrived in perfect conditionsI have no complaints", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Have Had Better Phones", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R2EVGUQO0DUDGU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I switched from the HTC Evo to the IPhone 5 mostly due to all the glitches in the EVO and wanting to try something diff. However, after switching to the IPhone, I must say that I liked my Evo better. The buttons on the IPhone are too small and i have skinny fingers. Additionally, there are no arrows to edit a text message for example, if I misspell a word, I have to tap around the screen to move the cursor but it will only move to the beginning or end of the word. Therefore, if I misspell a word I have to delete the entire word. This is annoying to me bcz I could easily correct my mistake on my Evo and not have to retype the entire word. If you plan on contracting with sprint, the internet connection for the Ipjone 5 is absolutely horrible bcz they are switching to the LTE network, so if there is no LTE connection in your area you will only get 3G and not 4G, which is like not having internet bcz the spinning loading icon will do just that all day. As a result you may not get emails for 3+ days if you only check them from your phone. I know several people across different states with the same issue. Initially I could watch full episodes on VH1 from my Evo but not on my iPhone 5. Anyway absolutely nothing stands out to me with this phone bcz in my opinion, the Evo had better features and is more practical. Most people who think the iPhones are the best devices have likely never experienced what other phones have to offer bcz they have been on the iphone band wagon for years. I don't mean picking up a phone in a store and playing around with it, I mean actually using a different phone for months like I have. So anyone who would pay $1000s for this phone is a complete fool especially when u can just buy a computer and a better phone.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "New", "Author": "Can.Li", "ReviewID": "R1DBCTAHTIQL9T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very fast, and very good. i like it! and this phone is model: A1429, i like A1429, very nice! i like it!", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth it!", "Author": "Iphone, overrated.", "ReviewID": "R3P7LXY2XASTEL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I preordered 2 iphones, a black one for me and a white one for my sister-in-law.

Brody", "ReviewID": "R170RPEE46W364", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My headline pretty much sums up my review.  This IS a great phone. Don't get me wrong.  The 2-star rating isn't because it's a bad phone.  It's because Apple basically did nothing to upgrade the 4S other than making it a pubic hair faster and re-designing it a bit to be slightly longer and lighter.  That's it.  The 4S is a great phone, the iPhone 5 is also great, but maybe, what, 2% better than the 4S? It's not worth it to upgrade, unless you have an iPhone 3 or something.Apple is a multi-billion dollar corporation for a reason.  They're brilliant.  They could have EASILY have given us tons of additional features that they have in their arsenal, but decided that enough people would buy the iPhone 5, based on the new design alone.  The major hardware upgrades will come with the 5S next year, when we'll see a 12 megapixel camera, and various other big-time upgrades.  And guess what?  People who bought the 5 will immediately buy the 5S, because this one will actually have \"must have\" features.  Apple's marketing and the way they mind-F their customers is absolutely brilliant.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing -- it's genius.If you have a 4S, you're a sucker for getting the 5, bottom line.  Shame on you if you already did.  Thankfully, my wife got the 5 (upgraded from a 3, that was literally falling apart), so I have had plenty of time to play around with it and form an opinion.  I will be keeping my 4S until the 5S comes out, probably this upcoming fall, and I'm sure the 5S will be revolutionary.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dissapointed", "Author": "megan", "ReviewID": "R390DY9CYNMR93", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So I love Apple first of all, I own a macbook pro, iPod touch 5th gen, and an iPad with retina display. I am by no means an Android fangirl. I previously owned an LG Revolution *crickets* this was like the first 4G LTE phone Verizon came out with about 2 years ago. So it finally crapped out and I needed a new phone, my cell provider is Verizon and my plan was up in about 3 months. I've heard they do early upgrades for some extra $, so I called to see if this was at all possible. Apple policy does not permit the sale of their iPhone's before the actual date of upgrade! What kind of baloney is that?! Not at all a wise marketing strategy.The second complaint I have about this product is that (I know I might get a lot of guff for this) but the iPhone is vastly over rated, most people solely just buy it for the label name. I have handled this device and I can say that I'm not impressed. The screen is extremely small, I feel it is too small for my hands and cannot imagine viewing videos or even texting on this phone. As for style goes it is the same cookie cutter design Apple puts out every year, minimalistic but sleek. It is light as a feather, which depending on the user could be a good/bad thing. I don't think this phone would hold up to a drop test the same as my LG behemoth. iOS 6 is perhaps the only highlight of this device, but there are much cheaper ways of getting iOS 6 in your pocket, such as the iPod touch 5th generation.Needless to say I will not be buying this product., instead I am going with the Samsung Galaxy S3.

First, the iPhone was top notch and it was not hard to explain to people why it was the best choice but these past two years I tell people that the iPhone may not have all the new features that the competitors are coming out with but it just works they way it should and does it very nicely but not any more. I've recently upgraded to the iphone 5 and have had nothing but problems. Gmail along with roadrunner and possibly other users be warned your email will no longer push to your phone using native mail app so if you care about getting your email (in my case work, university, and personal emails) do not expect to do it with the ease of the mail app. Something that happened in January but no one was alerted and you only find out by upgrading devices only to learn you cannot get your email like you used to. Guess that's the thanks I get for being a loyal customer.Also, if your notes happen to link with your gmail and you remove your gmail from the mail application, say goodbye to your notes, even new ones you add.Just an overall disappointing experience I guess. It's up to you, I still like Apple products but I have been extremely disappointed with Apple's lack of evolution and now instead of evolution I've found regression.

Apple makes a lot of money on these phones, but that just means consumers have to pay more.Memory. 16 GB isn't enough when you consider the iOS uses some of that space. Then add your apps and you have limited room for music, audiobooks and such. As I mentioned, I got a 64 GB, but that goes back to the price issue.Screen Size.

I can go into detail about that, but first I need to mention that while the first few generations of the phone had a decent battery life of up to several days, even a week, this phone will give you about 12 to 16 HOURS, and that's without making calls or using data and apps.  You must carry your charging cable with you at all times or you will be faced without having a phone, per say.  In addition to that, the battery is not chargeable on its own, in other words, you cannot swap a battery and use one while the other sits and charges, in this day where android phones do provide such solutions for the \"on the go\" person that uses their phone as a business tool, this is just too hindering.So while the phone is neat and sharp, without a competitive battery life, it's useless.

The problem is that there is no email flexibility that comes even close to a Blackberry.  The iPhones have a critical design flaw that may be done on purpose to promote the use of more data by phone carriers because of IMAP syncing.1) You cannot receive Gmail to both your Gmail on your computer and your iPhone unless you choose IMAP.  If you choose IMAP your phone always needs an internet connection to synchronize and view Gmail account.  So your phone is always hunting and reloading stupidly - eating up data and slowing you down.2) If you create a new gmail account on the iPhone and have your main Gmail forward to your new iphone gmail, this only takes care of incoming messages, because you cannot \"send as\" using your main Gmail account.  This is unbelievable.3) Often - when we configure company emails with the iPhone, the iPhone will receive emails, but the iPhone will not send.  This is not user error - as we checked this 30 times before stating  it here, all of our outgoing smtp servers were correct.  Still not working!4) The iPhone has to hunt for messages - while other superior and reliable email server systems like the Blackberry RIM network pushes out emails to your device nearly instantly.5) Remember for those of you who write lengthy emails, the Blackberry user can type long fluent messages quickly with fewer errors and even with text assist to fix your mis-types - the iPhone is super slow and frustrating for the serious typist/message writers.6) No other alternative email clients (apps) can address these issues either.Bite the bullet - save the money and stay with your Blackberry if you email is the most important business tool. I am giving my iPhone 5 32GB to my wife and trying a Samsung Galaxy 2S.  If that doesn't work - I go back to the Blackberry.  I cannot waste 3 days plying with iPhone configurations only to find out there are no solutions because of operating system design flaws.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Years behind competitors still.", "Author": "Bubba", "ReviewID": "R2MEJ3448II5K8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is funny how some iphone supporters rave this phone with only the fact that it has a bigger screen, the earphone jack is on the bottom, wow! And they also try and justify that Apple is smart because they wanted to stay with a smaller screen than the competitors because it keeps it manageable with one hand and a bigger screen is not better. Well partially true, but the elongated screen makes it awkward to reach the upper and lower parts of the screen with one handed operation also depending on one's hand size. So kind of an invalid argument there, but hand size dictates on both phones also. Smaller screen more scrolling, harder to see, easier to use with one hand. Bigger screen less scrolling, easier to see may need two hands to operate. If your are going from a smaller phone to a 5 inch screen phone, yes it does seem huge, but after having one for a while, you adapt and you don't notice it anymore and find it more more pleasant to use because the larger screen can display more.  The S4 has a 5 1/2 inch screen now but kept the body the same size as the S3.  Any body larger than the S3 would be pushing the limit I believe.  The S3 fits in normal pockets with no problem, unless your wearing skinny jeans or those jeans that girls wear with tiny pockets in the back.  A 4 inch phone barely fits in those pockets.  The iPhone 5 is basically the same length as the S3 but narrower.  Different strokes for different folks.  Battery argument isn't realistic or fare to compare between a phone with a way larger screen. Apple fans claim it is the best iphone ever! Yeah it maybe the best iphone ever, but not by much. And it may be the best iphone, but not the best phone.Let's see..what does iphone have that others don't. Bigger screen? No. Do a split screen and run two tasks at the same time? No. Wouldn't work on a 4 inch screen anyways.  Customizable screen? No.  And jailbreaking doesn't count.  Smaller screen on the iphone without the ability to customize it makes it busy and a confusing mess with all the app. icons crammed onto the screen, and worse if you have a background set onto it to add to the mess. Nicer screen? Not by much. Also you don't really get the full use of the 4 inch display because just like the ipads, the screen dimensions are not optimized for full screen viewing of certain media. So you still get those black bars either on top or on the sides.  And not all of the iphone apps. are updated to utilize the full screen yet. Another thing also is that when you surf the web, you get the settings bar displayed on the bottom of the screen also, which takes up useable screen space, unlike some phones that have dedicated keys on the bottom edge and make use of it not like the iphone where it just has one button and wastes all that space on the top and bottom. You get two thick borders, and I don't see how some say it is a nice looking phone. Faster? Not by much where it would matter or noticeable. And that is where the majority of iphone reviewers focus on. It is only faster by a fraction of a second if that. They make it sound like it was blazingly faster than everything else and that's all they basically use as an argument and nothing else, like features. And also it is a waste of a more powerful processor and wonderful platform etc. if you can't do much on it. Comes in black or white? Ooh! Really? Black and white? Drop test survival and sleekish looks? Most phones go into cases anyways so kind of a moot point. And most people buy the thick unattractive cases to protect their expensive iPhone's that make the phone a large brick that looks like it was made by Nerf. It makes the iPhone bulkier than a S3. Memory slot to expand memory? No, competitors had it for years. Usb and not proprietary cable? No. Simple drag and drop files instead of using software? No. People say that the iphone is easier to use than Android? How is it easier if you have to connect it to a computer to convert music and video using software all the time? Yes it is easier for those that buy the next generataion iphone everytime a new model comes out because it is basically the same phone as previous that you are used to using for years. If you don't like change and learning new features or having choices, then the iphone is for you. Flash support? No. Competitors have it and you can watch everything instead of a dead spot on your web page. Easily customizable screens? No. Swappable battery? No. Favorite contacts list on screen? No. Place the phone in sleep mode and allowing only certain calls to get through? Competitor had it already and you can set a time frame for it. Better maps? No. Competitors better. Although no one could beat the Garminfone I had before, because it was a \"real gps\", and it didn't need to rely on a data signal to function fully like everyone with the exception of Nokia. But that's another story.  Hmmm..oh wait, I know.  You can multitask now just like competitors have been able to do for years now. No, wait. That isn't it. You can only multitask with the iphone with only a few applications. Like listening to the music player.  And if you want to surf the web while on a call, you can only do it through wifi depending on which carrier you have. What the heck?  I paid for an expensive wonderful phone along with outrageous minutes and a data plan but I have to look for a wifi connection to use it? I'm sorry that is not multitasking.The android apps are pretty much caught up to iphone's.  Just about all the competitors use android and only iphone uses iphone apps.  Same goes for tablets and even the competitors tablets offer more than the ipads.For example the Samsung Galaxy S3 has everything the iphone 5 has and more. Heck, you can even transfer files between the phones wirelessly, link up with compatible phones and do a presentation between the phones or beam everything onto a compatible tv, set the phone up with other compatible phones where everyone that is synced within the group to receive pictures that any of you take on the fly.  Sure iphone fans will say well not everyone has a S3 and everyone has an iphone. Well not true, because a lot of people are buying the S3 and the people that have the iphone's do not have any of these features to enjoy.  And Samsung is also selling a lot of t.v's that are compatible with the features or you can buy a converter unit to hook up to any t.v. with a usb port if need be. I have a Sony google t.v. that I didn't need to do anything special to, and I can send my pictures via wifi onto the t.v. Not like apple where they will change little things here and there to make you buy new hardware.  For example, the adapters. Apple likes to hold back and make little upgrades to the iphone a little at a time or make a phone with a little more memory and hype it up as the next greatest innovation. This is how Apple operates to get iphone die hards to keep upgrading their iphones.Going to get a lot of hate responses from iphone lovers.  Just back it up with something other than some lame sarcastic remark. I am not an iphone, Android, Windows, Samsung, etc. fan either. My daughters friends got the iphone 5 and they all either returned them or wish they did. My daughter has a Samsung blaze and a lot of her friends want one also. My sister and brother in law got the iphone 4 and my brother in law returned it and got the Samsung S3, and my sister wished she returned hers and got something elso also. I played with iphones and got bored with them real quick because I couldn't do much on it. Yes the screen looks fantastic, but I need a phone that has functions that can make my life easier. A phone these days is your personal organizer on the go. You need something that you can customize to your personal needs for quick access to information at your fingertips. With andorid you can do this, iphone you can't. So speed to open an app. is defeated by the fact that you have to scroll though the pages of icons and find it in the mess to get to it to open it. With android you can customize your screen and apps. however you want it and this makes it way faster to open an app.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good choice", "Author": "Vilija Miniotiene", "ReviewID": "R2EDB7T8JMQSI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it !

I would not recommend this phone as the price does not match the quality.  You get more with the the Galaxy Note 2 for just a little bit more money. I am a heavy phone user. I am comparing the Iphone to other phones on the market. Second, The phone is still fragile. My friend broke his within the first 2 weeks of getting the phone.  Calls still dropping alot.  Apple is improving a little.  Bigger screen and LTE but still far behind Android. He is on Verizon which is the best network so there is no excuse.

The Iphone 4 if I could give it a zero I would have.  3rd Again apple is just catching up to Jellybean OS from android as my previous review of the Iphone 4, Apple has copied alot of stuff from Android. People who use Android will know about notification bar, Cloud backup, Widgets, Voice Navigation, Voice command, 4g, LTE, etc the list goes on but most of these feature were from 4 years ago on Android as Apple has barely put it in the IPhone. I also fix phone so I see these phone comes in for screen repair and also the back of the phone breaks a lot.  Parts are easy to find though and there are plenty of people who repair this phone.  I use every product and test it as best as I can.  I had apple when the 2g was out which was the best phone than but apple has fallen way behind and it is showing.  As far as current sales goes Samsung has taken the number one spot overtaking Nokia as the number one phone manufacturer.

I suppose the 1 hour and 6 minutes I've been waiting now should provide a clue. My first apple rep--I haven't spoken to the second one yet, told me there's a lot of people trying to get their accounts fixed.  By the way, if you call Apple with your cell phone, make sure you plug it into your charger. Otherwise, you will need to go find it around 1 hour and 10 minutes. OK, I'm still waiting on that second person to answer the phone, so I think I will go provide Apple a few more reviews.

I checked what I was told there with a Mac Mall store.  Here is what I discovered.  A chain is only as strong as it weakest link.  What is the weakest link in a cell phone?  The battery.  We know it will last about two years, at which time it must be replaced.  You cannot replace an iPhone battery.  The battery is an intragral part of the phone.  This is also true with other smart phone brands.  So, when the battery is dead, the phone is dead. It's junk.  I was told by the Mac Mall store employee that Apple does not replace iPhone batteries.  Your only option is to get a new phone.  They also told me that if I could find a battery they would replace it.  I asked where I might find one.  They had no idea.  There are apparently no after market batteries for even the 4.  As I said this situation is also true for other smart phone brands.  So, the bottom line is, iPhones and others, are really very expensive disposble phones.I'm buying a Samsung.  You can replace the battery.If this story doesn't bother you, than enjoy your new disposable smart phone.  Every two years.

For example, Camera+ is better than Camera, Google Maps is undoubtedly better than Apple Maps which was a complete mess, Google Now is better than Siri. Google Now has everything ready for you before you ask it a question. The phone literally has the same functionality as the two previous releases if you just download the iOs 6 upgrade. This upgrade will make your iPhone 4 or 4s have just as much internet speed and battery life as the iPhone 5. It's literally the same thing,  just a quarter of an inch smaller.In case you didn't know, Americans have spent $6 billion dollars fixing their iPhones since its first release in 2007. Get ready to see that number go up because the new iPhone is more fragile than Chris Bosh. The iPhone 5 is thinner and longer and with all laws of physics considered, that means it has more of a probability to break. Siri was cool for about a week and a half after its release on the iPhone 4s. If you ask any iPhone user, they will tell you they barely use it because she gives you wrong information after mishearing just about every command. Siri hasn't gotten much smarter in the iPhone 5, still bombarding the user with facts and figures you weren't even looking for. Remember those good old days when you could walk into any place whether it be a restaurant or a friend's apartment and  almost be sure you will be able to charge your phone? The same charger that worked for various Apple products also conveniently could charge every type of iPhone. We are sad to report that those days are over, as Apple decided to change the size of the connector that the charger plugs into on the bottom of the phone. Now, the standard Apple charger that fit every phone for the past five years no longer fit into the iPhone 5.
