{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hot little phone!", "Author": "Faisal Siddiqui", "ReviewID": "R31X1RNCMCANPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow!  This is a BEAUTIFUL phone, kicks butt of flip version of Shine from Verizon.  Slider is sweet, phone feels solid.  AND boy DOES it SHINE!!.... in virtually most lighting.  Roll bar select key is a bit tricky at first but soon becomes very natural, AND you look so cool because of it!  Has basic goodies, SIM card very accessible and compatible, battery life better than average.  Standard MP3 player.  Has microSD expansion slot for up to 2GB.  Slight problems with reception outside of major metropolitan areas and some dead spots in small cities due to tri-band but overall pretty good (I use AT&T;/Cingular).  Tons of cool ringtones and sound effects.  Mirrored effect slightly difficult to read in strong sunlight.  USB connection to desktop worked effortlessly like direct plug flash drive.  Camera quite decent although some delay in trigger.  Has flash but only on/off - no auto.  2 megapixel photos are better than most.  Hottest slider around, no doubt.  I use this as my cool factor phone.  Highly recommend it!  Please check out tri-band reception in your area first to avoid disappointment.", "Date": "September 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Brilliant but flawed", "Author": "R. Mocan", "ReviewID": "R1XSGMCBXRD4BO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I must echo other online reviews about this phone. It shines... and basically that's what it does.This is a phone about fashion. And thus, I believe it's geared towards fashion concious women.I'm a middle aged male and I enjoy the shiny look and appreciate the elgant metal that covers most of the phone (so much that it's not just an \"accent\").I also appreciate the good sound of the MP3 player and the autofocus of the 2 Megapixel camera with Schneider-Kreuznach Optics (whoever they are).Therefore, I bought it for my wife. BUT I didn't notice that it didn't work on her operator's band, so I'm stuck with it.As a middle aged male who's looking for more function than form, this beautiful phone just doesn't work for me, and here's why:1. The scrolling wheel is not responsive enough.2. The keys are awkardly placed. Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3. Also, there's not much tactile feedback to notice the separation between the keys (so you must be able to look at the phone when dialing). Try texting fast with it...4. The interfase software is not great. Very basic MP3 player.5. Love the autofocus... Hate the autofocus! It's great that you can get the camera to focus on things 1 inch away from the lens. Great to take a good pic of a business card or any other stationary object. Bad if you try to shoot a moving target, because it takes at least one full second to focus. It just won't work because there's such a delay (at least 2 seconds) from the moment you press the button to the moment the picture is taken, that you get either blurred pictures or the events you want to picture have already passed (and gone). You can't shut down the shutter (no mute, can't change the sound either). And where's the ZOOM??? Couldn't figure it out: Volume keys don't do it and scroll wheel doesn't do it either.6. Shine! Really, I had never experienced such a frustrating thing as trying to use this phone in sunlight. It's near impossible. It REALLY is that bad.7. Bluetooth connection has not happened smoothly. I haven't been able to send pics via bluetooth to my BlackBerry Curve. And when I connect the ear piece to the Shine, the ear piece loses all settings and stops connecting to my BB (so I must do the whole pairing process again). I had a Nokia before and I could connect my ear piece to both phones simmultaneously without a problem (I'm not saying I could have two conversations at once, but I could receive a call from any of the two phones at one time).8. Reception is not good9. Scratches easily all over; fingerprint magnet10. I drive a lot. I LOVE voice dialing. Where is it?11. The loudspeaker is so underpowered that the speakerphone function is close to useless. I love speakerphones because I can multi-task with both hands free.So, if you're someone who expects a cell phone to be more functional than a basic $10 household phone, maybe this one's not for you.If you want to shell $200 for a great looking phone that only works as a phone (and not the best at that), that's your call. You can alwas look at it as a piece of jewelery (or get one of those gold plated phones with diamonds and rubies).I'm fine and happy with my BlackBerry Curve, thank you. Even if I still have to get me a better camera.Two other words of advice:1. I bought an unlocked phone imported from I don't know where. Thus, be sure to check connectivity with your operator first! Tri-Band means the phone works on any of 3 bands... make sure your operator has one of them.2. My primary language is spanish and the phone I got seems to be an asian version. Thus I can only choose between english and a bunch of asian languages (vietnamese, chinese, simplified chinese, etc.)", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "worthy of unboxing pics", "Author": "Mitchell Glucroft", "ReviewID": "R16CB3GOX7QTGX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is probably the first device that excited me before I even unboxed it since I got my iBook a couple years ago.  I give credit to LG for taking the time and investing the money in exciting packaging.  I mean, you're dropping $300.  That's not chump change for most of us.  Give us some bang for our buck, and LG does that.  Props for that.The phone itself is stunning to look at and its surprising heft is a nice change from all the pennyweight ultra slim phones out there.  You'd do some damage if you chucked this phone at someone.You may want to throw it when you realize that it's packaged with an AC adaptor which is most definitely not of US origin.  I don't know if that thing came from Korea or Germany or what but it looked like a stun gun to me.  Fortunately a nearby store had a cheap compatible adaptor.Setting up the phone has been a little tedious but I can get online after a day and I can make calls and send/receive SMS/MMS messages.  I think it's lack of the 850 band makes it a bit of a risk in some areas but I think I can manage missing the occasional call. I'm not owned by my phone.The LG Shine is a good call if you want a cool phone that isn't like every other phone out there and you don't mind monkeying around with WAP and MMS settings.", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great phone, one major drawback", "Author": "L.

Feels sturdy, has a REALLY good sliding action, nice to have the \"profiles\" so you can easily/quickly change the alert settings, nice to be able to use mp3's as ring tones (unlike some motorolas I have had...) has a nice menu function with shortcuts, and is very nice looking.  The one thing I wish it had is a better AlarmClock.  It only has a very limited number of tones (none of them very good for an alarm clock) and you can only set on alarm.  That is the ONE thing I miss from my slvr, with it you could set multiple alarms.

I believe that it's truly bullet-proof.  She has never had a phone that lasted over a few months - she drops it constantly.  Once, the phone slipped out of her shirt pocket into an ice chest and lay there, under water and ice for 12 hours before she found it.  She shook it off, dried the battery compartment and it fired right up.  I don't know about the ease of using it in sunlight, like others have commented, but I can say that this has been the toughest phone I've ever seen.  I would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "love my LG shine", "Author": "pigeongirl", "ReviewID": "R1XJLLF06UGTT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Along with the LG shine in box thought I would have gotten head phones.

Nguyen", "ReviewID": "RC0PVCCWBDPDB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great looking phone.  The one I have was from Poland.  Aesthetically speaking, it's hard to find fault with the phone.  It's very shiny.  Only negatives about the phone are that the screen picks up fingerprints like crazy and the numbers are a bit hard to press. The number pads are flat and on the same level.  They aren't elevated or separated from each other very well like my previous phones.  I kept worrying that my fingers would accidently press an adjoining number, and I have pretty small fingers.My cell needs are really basic.  I just need to be able to receive and make calls, and text.  You're not going to be able to connect to the web with this phone unless you contact your service provider.  The cell also comes with a current adapter since it's a foreign electronic.  Overall, it's a good phone to have if your needs for a cell are pretty basic.", "Date": "March 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "LG shine cellphone", "Author": "Rhetta Kent", "ReviewID": "R2RVYIXRK5AOC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent.

Chun", "ReviewID": "R3O5GSV8U5KN6C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my wife as a surprise upgrade from her Motorola C139 - what a big mistake!While the Shine is very good looking, the metal casing makes the phone much more heavy (good thing for some)and thicker than shown on the ads.what is truly bad with this phone is the poor software which has several layers to get what you want.  For example you can't get to your telephone directory list w/o doing a search for by name.  On the C139, you simply press the \"up\" or \"down\" arrow, and you are taken directly to your directory list.mp3 player - while there is a built in one on this phone, there is few (if any) options to figure out playlists etc.  moving songs to the SD card is also very cumbersome.  Again, i blame this on the software.Lastly, the battery life is terrible.  First, the charger is an international adaptor, and you need to be sure it's plugged in correctly to the socket as well as to the phone, often you could not tell if the phone was actually charging; you had to play around, press random buttons to be sure the charging sign was \"on\".Battery life is about 48 hours on an idle phone!!! much shorter if you actually use the darn thing.  With the software being so bad, you usually use about \"2 bars out of 5\" just going thru the various menus to add contacts, or try to figure out \"short cuts\" for the software (about 10 min of use).  Then you have to struggle with the charging aspect again....We really wanted to love this phone especially given its good looks and the price we paid for it +$200, but no love, can cure this dog...", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Waste of money", "Author": "Tara Barnard", "ReviewID": "R4AM7JHMIF8D0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone was a total disapointment.
