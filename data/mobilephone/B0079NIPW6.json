I have the Nokia Lumia 800, Nokia N9 and Nokia N8 that I switch between depending on the situation/activities I am expecting that day.  I previously used the Dell Venue Pro as my Windows Phone with the N9/N8.  I tend to gravitate toward the Lumia 800 for the majority of regular activities.  I enjoy the way that WP7.5 has simplified things when I am just lounging around and having a good time.  Here is a review for each of the different components to this bundle.Lumia 800Positive+ Fantastic build quality+ \"Fast\" and fluid operation+ Zero stability problems (I see more lag on my New iPad while entering text than I ever have on a Windows Phone)+ Good camera (not great camera)  Dynamic range is better than most  Mostly accurate white balance (struggles in some artificial lighting)  Good auto selections (I manually pick ISO and exposure in low light situations)  Macro shots can be great but it tends to focus on the background too much if you aren't really careful in where you place the focal point+ Screen is accurately calibrated unlike most AMOLED screens+/- Smaller screen size (I actually prefer this most of the time)+ Design is second to none++ This is just a fun/refreshing phone to useNegative- No front facing camera if you like video chat/skype-/+ Smaller screen size (I actually prefer this most of the time)- No WP8 update- App selection for the newest trending apps on iOS/Android is lacking (most have an alternative but not always the original/newest versions)- Macro camera shots are way tougher than they should be because of the way it tends to focus on the immediate background- Screen should be a little brighter than it is using auto brightness (sunlight legibility is good though)- Microsoft is slow on releasing the updates in the US for the Lumia 800 (I have already received the Tango update on my Venue Pro but it is not released for the Lumia 800)  There is an annoying audio bug if you listen to games at low levels it has been fixed in other regions but not released in the US (once you hit 5-6 on the audio level it actually jumps to full volume again in games)- Chrome camera badge scratches easily- This one is really a WP7 annoyance (looking at the pictures on the camera roll they are always way darker than what was captured unless you zoom in ever so slightly from the default zoom)Overall 9.75/10Play 360I absolutely love this thing.  I take this to the beach/park all the time.Positive+ Great audio quality for the size/portable speakers (much better than the alternatives)+ Excellent battery life (easily replaceable for longer trips away from power)+ Easy to use with any bluetooth capable device+ Great for using with a tablet while watching movies on the goNegative- I want to buy another oneOverall 10/10Monster Purity HDPositive+ Good audio quality+ Not as bass heavy as the regular Monster headphones+ Catchy looks and great comfort+ Fairly neutral sound (a little too much midrange for some tracks)+ Good frequency response+ Two seperate cables to support other Nokia productsNegative- Finger print magnets- A little too much midrange on some tracks- They can be hot if you are active- Second cable does not have inline volume controls- Scratches could be a problem if they are using the same plastic as the Luna bluetooth headsetOverall 9.25/10Luna HeadsetPostive+ Easy to use (especially with an N9 or other NFC device)+ Small and light+ Comfortable to wear+ Great battery life especially with the storage unit+ I have been impressed with the sound qualityNegative- I am right between sizes for the ear piece so it can fall out if I am active and not careful- Scratches really easily if you have it in your pocket with anything else- Only covers the basics with functionality- Tiny button to push for answering/voice functionsOverall 8.5/10I really believe that this is an excellent hardware bundle.  I caught it at a good time and feel like I got a steal of a deal for the price I paid.  If you are looking for a great phone that is easy to use and offers a refreshing change of pace and are searching for headphones, or a portable speaker to go with it put this on your short list.  It would be expensive if this was just a phone purchase but you are also getting a great portable speaker, some Monster headphones and a great sounding headset.  Overall I would give this Bundle a solid 9.5/10.  The phone is absolutely in the top 3 design and build wise, it is fast, smooth and a wonderful change of pace in handset design.  The other items are just the icing on the cake.

They didn't skimp on the quality or the design on any of these products. From Lumia 800 feel perfect in the hand. It has a great feel and a great weight and substance. The headphones are very comfortable with great sound quality, but a little base heavy, just a little. The portable speaker is loud and sounds the same plugged and unplugged, it's very practical with 20 hours of play time, relatively light, with a nice case.It's a great buy, you can't go wrong with this bundle. It simply amazing craftsmanship.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0079NIPW6"}}
