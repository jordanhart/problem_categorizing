I was really upset not only because it was terribly refurbished, and did not come with headphones but also because it actually took 6 days to get to me. So I was phoneless for that long. However, I received it from Top shelf electronics in just 2 business days and it was new! No scratches, came with headphones, and it was just pure happiness sent to me. :)", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone!", "Author": "Gregori D.
