The display is beautiful. I love the camera. Its fast just like my Motorola Atrix 4G....and it runs smothe.The screen on my Artix 4G (MB860) got cracked so even though I am going to order a new glass replacement I wanted to upgrade as well. I always use GSM Arena to compare my phones to make sure that I dont buy a phone that is less in features and ability. Boy did I hit the nail on the head with this one.I live in the Bahamas and while our people are mainly impressed with the HTC's, Samsung Galaxy's, Iphones and any other big names and latest phones that you can think of I like phones like these that they dont normally go after. My brother says I always buying these weird phones lol but little that he knows my phone is just as good as his Samsung Galaxy S4 in my world lol. The display is even as good as his own.I really appreciate the seller I got this from. I purchased it used and unclocked and it came unlocked but doesn't looked used at all! Super deal for $87. Best deal I found on Amazon since the year started lol.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Motorola Atrix 2 \" Came LOCKED!!!\"", "Author": "Edmilson", "ReviewID": "RBEEWPIDX8VY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have bought a Motorola at this Store, they said it wasUNLOCKED, but the Cell Phone Motorola Atrix 2came LOCKED!!!I am very disappoint!!!!You trust a announce, buy the product, and the productcomes not the way they say!!!
