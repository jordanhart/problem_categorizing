{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Flipside Pro's and Cons", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R2J4KBLBATMMYD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The rating reflects the balance between value and performance. This phone is cheap - 15% of the cost of a top end Smartphone but performance is poor -  you get what you pay for.The plus points - It's cheap. - it runs on WiFi - this is a huge plus as you don't need to pay for phone network data. Set updates and data  delivery to WiFi only - It has a keyboard  - touchscreen input on cheap phones with small screens is a nightmare, - it works fine on Skype (and with rear camera allowing video calls) - and this combines with the use of WiFi giving free/low cost calls anywhere you can get WiFi - Screen is good - e-mail easy to set up - slot for Micro SD. - small trackpad at bottom of phone very useful for highlighting and selecting web options - avoids the issue of hitting the wrong option with a finger on a tiny screenThe Minus Points- Insufficient internal phone memory - load Skype and update to Play Store and that's about it. Out of memory!! This is THE major problem with the phone. (Why did Motorola not add more memory?)- Usually won't run videos - probably related to above- No UMA - if mobile network coverage is poor some phones can route calls through WiFi. Very useful if you live in a poor coverage area. This phone can't do it.- Associated Motorola PC software randomly consumes huge amounts of CPU time even when the phone is not connected!! Don't bother installing.- lots of AT&T; bloatware that consumes what little memory there is and usually is expensive to use- no flash on the camera.Part of the solution to the memory problem (which is the real downside to this phone) is to root the phone and then delete the bloatware and move the applications to the sd card. But it's not as easy as it seems. Rooting goes OK but applications won't always move and there's not much memory there anyway. And with rooting you risk bricking the phone. Yet to be tried is partitioning the sd card to act as phone memory. If this works it should solve the memory issue but we'll see. I'll post an update.Overall - if you want a low-cost smartphone with easy data input (the keyboard), access to e-mail, free WiFi-based surfing and Skype this is for you. But don't expect to be able to download many apps or be able to play much (if anything)in the way of streamed video.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great deal- under certain conditions.", "Author": "S. B.", "ReviewID": "R2WVKJ5GUQJBMO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off, Android 2.1 is a flop. It doesn't allow you to run apps from your SD memory card. Avoid it entirely unless you wish to use this as a basic phone only and you can get it really cheap! Probably should be ~$15 less than a Flipside with Android 2.2 from what I have seen. Android 2.2 is much better for running apps and is the oldest version of Android I will entertain- and only version in the Flipside I will entertain. But what hamstrings this phone is its memory management and awful lack of internal memory, even in 2.2. A good SD card itself is not enough to make it run well. If you are a budding Android hacker you will see there are some workarounds. I've done some of the less intrusive ones which has helped a bit. But to get rid of the awful ATT bloatware from the internal memory in order to get anything resembling stability & functionality you have to \"root\" your phone. Google will help you find this info- but be warned that it MIGHT destroy the phone and it WILL void your warranty. And it will take time & effort. I believe I will be trying this when I find time. Once these particular hindrances are thrown off I fully expect this phone to be all I wish. (If you expect the latest & greatest just go get the latest & greatest- it cannot be found for under $70!) If you want to avoid the hassles this phone brings- and most should probably avoid it- there are other low end Motorola Android phones available for not that much more cost. See the Motorola website, and do your homework looking at reviews. Still- I like my Flipside; it has above average signal in fringe areas which is a must for me. I like the keyboard. Its performance is just fine when it is not wigging out from its paltry internal memory being overloaded. If you enjoy challenges, you might really like this phone. If you have zero desire to download apps or do much streaming media, you may love this phone. Otherwise, understand its limitations and strengths then decide if it might be worth an extra $30 to $50 to upgrade a little. In any case, doing your research is advised.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for the price", "Author": "olga j.", "ReviewID": "R2ITA9QISV1F1Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "good phone for the price.
