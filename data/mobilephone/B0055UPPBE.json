I have never been able to get pre-loaded videos from the memory card to play on the phone, and I have tried a few different formats. The interface on the mp3 player mode is a little odd and takes some getting used to-however it does work well. The camera takes excellent pictures (5MP), and has an actual external flash. The phone takes decent videos as well, but the video sound quality is not great.Image heavy sites do not work well on this phone due to limited memory issues, so if you are trying to use non-mobile sites for most sites this may not be a great choice. This has nothing to do with the proprietary browser on the phone-I have tried using Opera mobile, and everything to do with system RAM. Sites like youtube will work, but only in the mobile version and it takes a while for it to load.The communication apps on this phone are solid. Google messenger, AIM and most of the pop3 email accounts and gmail work pretty well on this. Microsoft exchange also works well on this phone and has the Quick Office app that allows you edit MS documents and MS excel files-although the screen is small. Some of the older e-series devices were compatible with Blackberry connect-this one is not-and no ad I have seen makes this clear.While some reviewers have commented that the keyboard on the phone is a little small, it is a little on the small side compared to BB-but this makes it easier to operate from one hand. This phone also has the Nokia predictive text built in-which is odd on a phone with a qwerty keyboard but makes emailing a lot faster. The trackpad operates very well but is very sensitive, and the soft key/home keys are also easy to press with one hand. However, the main screen is not as customizable as other smart phone devices.Ovi maps is the GPS on the phone, and for the most part, it works well. What I really like about Ovi maps is the ability to download maps to the phone and use the maps/gps without a data connection. Google maps is still a downloadable file and it does work well.T-Mobile bloat wear is abundant on this phone-beware.I have been using my e73 for over a year-if you have any specific questions feel free to leave a comment and I can try to help!QUAD Band and t-mobile, europe, asia enabled (2100/900/1700).", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's a good phone", "Author": "dw12345", "ReviewID": "R4WFROJSGCMSA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a good phone,the battery work efficient ,and the wifi also work wonderful and it also support 3G work well", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Fonseca", "ReviewID": "RQHMLALIMMIFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my father, but I've been using it for a while just to check everything.

My previous phone was the Nokia 6301 (also from T-Mobile) and I loved it so much I wanted to get another Nokia. Boy was I disappointed!Good points- Solid construction- QWERTY keyboard for note taking and texting- Battery lasts a long while, especially when you activate the power savings feature- The back flashlight is very useful- Great for travel - unlike the Nokia 6301, this is quad band and automatically adjusts clock based on location.- Free visual voicemailBad points- Buggy - on my phone if you hit Menu, followed by Exit, you end up locking the keypad. Why does it do that? One night I was talking to someone while the phone was charging and I noticed that the screen showed no indication that a phone call was taking place. After the call ended, the only way I was able to turn off the phone was to remove the battery. Also the visual voicemail is buggy. It often mis-identifies the name of the caller who left the voicemail.- Unintuitive - it took me a long while to figure out where to go to set alarm clock. (in case you have the same question it is Menu > Applications > Clock)- Poor features - this is the first phone I owned that does not save call duration. During the phone call, there is a ticking clock that tells you how long you've been on but that information is lost after the call ends.Since I got this phone for free, I can't complain too much because I got what I paid for. ;)", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not an unlocked phone", "Author": "Unhappy in Haiti", "ReviewID": "R1XK0EPC2UF4L5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone was listed as an unlocked phone.
