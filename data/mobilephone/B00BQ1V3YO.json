It's fast, responsive, and does virtually everything! The screen is beautiful and the phone itself is very fun to use. I love using the S Pen for jotting down quick notes on the go. I also love how the phone has an option to be used with just one hand. It makes using the phone easier when you can't hold it with two hands or when you're not using the S Pen. This phone is also very sleek and stylish. I get compliments on it all the time. You can't go wrong with buying this phone!", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BQ1V3YO"}}
