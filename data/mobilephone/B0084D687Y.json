I can't seem to figure out how to set my own videos as the Power On/Off animations, nor do I know what kind of video files it needs; the manual is thin, barely covers any specs or features, and is primarily in Spanish, and the only information I can seem to gather on it is what's posted on the description here on Amazon and in the comments here. The FM Radio is very good quality--it picked up on stations that all other radio devices I own garble and/or don't receive at all. The menu and controls are a bit odd and difficult to get used to, and as far as I know, you can't set different ringtones for different contacts, nor can you add more fields for contacts. In addition to this, some of the photos I have aren't displayed or able to be set as they are \"too large\", so to set your own background you'll need to crop or resize the photos to the pixels the screen can support (which, I haven't figured out yet. It seems 300 works horizontally). The camera isn't that good, either, but it does allow the option, when plugged in, to be used as a webcam, which is a nifty feature.TL;DR, I haven't had it long enough to say I'd buy it again, but for the price it is, I would. It's a good phone, but not a great one.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "functional phone for children although not bring games", "Author": "Aguilar Heidi", "ReviewID": "R3IGVZPV9S6MVX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Most basic of which apparently described. poor camera.

This has even been used by many others traveling and it was very reasonable price.  It served it's purpose of a second phone.

Very Happy!", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cute, functional, practical", "Author": "Felonia", "ReviewID": "R3U2TTYJGG5R8A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Firstly, this phone is itty-bitty - which I think is nice. It's lighter than my former slide-out-keyboard phone, while still having the same qwerty functionality. The small keyboard may indeed be a problem for those with large clumsy fingers, perhaps even for those with very short nails. It's fine for me.I have T-mobile service and it works well. I do not use the internet feature, though.The English portion of the manual starts at ~2/3 through the booklet.I very much like that this phone has a media player and a headphone jack. The sound is better than I expected.What I do love about this phone is that I can plug it into a computer and easily access the files. I don't need a separate card reader for the micro SD, as I've dealt with before. Micro USB cables are wonderful in general (cheap and easy to find/share), but especially on a phone that will actually communicate with a computer.Also important to note, you can alter whether or not your phone vibrates and/or rings by going to the \"customize\" option in user profiles.One reviewer claimed that this worked as a webcam for him - I do not share that experience. I do have linux, and that may be the issue, but this phone does not make the claim to be a webcam.I haven't used the dual-sim feature, but I very much like having it. I can foresee situations in which it's handy, especially since I hang out with a few people with unreliable phones.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "milton1987", "ReviewID": "RUXLEO37EO0LG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very basic phone but easy to use. has two sim card spots which ive never had before and it says my sim memory is smaller than it really is but after I got used to that it's a good phone.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Kara Dupont \"Mrs. Edward Anthony\"", "ReviewID": "R3OUY3JQ9XAY8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is perfect!
