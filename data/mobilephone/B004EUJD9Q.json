This phone is perfect for both, without any extra features or apps (which I didn't want to spend money on to begin with).I have owned and used this phone for about a week now, with T-mobile.It's speaker volume and clarity as well as when you hold it up to ear are both excellent. This is a great simple phone if you are looking for basic functions only. It's nicely sized, not too bulky to fit in a small pocket, and is very light. Connected to my bluetooth ear-piece easily, and worked well. The only thing is the phone is made of plastic which makes me want to get a rubberized cover for it in case it falls or gets scratched. Over all I am very pleased with this phone!", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good cheap phone, sturdy.

So I took a gamble and ordered this one for her.Apparently it's really easy to use. So easy that Mom, who could never program her VCR, has figured out how to take pictures of her cat with it. She's quite hard-of-hearing and has had no trouble hearing the phone ring, and I don't have to yell at her when I call her. She was thrilled that her contacts that were saved onto her old SIM card transferred to this phone just fine when I installed the card and booted it up.
