{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Motorola WX345 Volume Too Low and Vibration Too Weak", "Author": "R. Barnett", "ReviewID": "R1E8THBHCQPRXG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you have noise around you, such as in a casino, you cannot hear the incoming call sound if the phone is in your pocket. To hear the call in a noisy area, you must have it in your hand and up near your ears. The volume control is located on the side of the phone where you would typically grasp the phone and that action will often inadvertently turn the volume control even lower. The vibration is so weak that you must have the phone in your hand... you will not feel the vibration if the phone is in your pocket. Not happy with this phone.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Faults Found", "Author": "C.

Jones \"Gentle_Raven\"", "ReviewID": "R3MWT4YLMVBU80", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's a nice phone over all. The features are great, except for the battery which has to be charged every other day at best. I have the Blue Tooth disabled thinking that would help, but the battery still dies rapidly. Called customer service for a different battery (the sent one to me for free), but it is no better.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Simple Phone", "Author": "Hal", "ReviewID": "RLNC20BZ70DN3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this used phone as a replacement while my other phone (same model) was in for warranty repair.  Motorola needs 7-10 days to repair or replace the original phone and I couldn't go without a phone for that long.  It will now become my backup.  The phone itself is a very functional phone without many bells and whistles, but I use it as a phone and nothing else.  It fits my needs perfectly.  I will add the used phone came looking and working like brand new.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works for Me", "Author": "J. Price \"jprice66\"", "ReviewID": "R2K3ZW3LJCIU9Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had two of these phones for almost 2 years and they have never let me down.  Very reliable performance.  Battery life is good.  It is a spartan phone, you use it to make and receive phone calls.  Text messaging is a chore but it can be done.  The camera is OK in bright sunlight, and forwarding a picture is easy.  The pictures appear much better quality when downloaded and viewed on a PC.  For me, the major con was no phone-book software for the PC.  With my previous el-cheapo LG I could edit and maintain my phone number list on the PC.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cell phone", "Author": "Harry", "ReviewID": "R3O3HECAZM076K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a gift and he is enjoying this one.

The volume controls are on the side of the phone, meaning if you keep the phone in your pocket (as I do), you are liable to inadvertently lower the ring volume every time you grasp it.  This has caused me to miss a number of calls.  Even when the volume is on high, however, it is too low to be heard outdoors when stored in your pocket.  Although this phone has a number of features, I use a phone only for making and receiving calls, and since I can't do that reliably, it flunks my test.", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Phone is prone to display loss", "Author": "JAD \"Joe\"", "ReviewID": "R1TYU3FRDWAOO5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone has many nice features however if you can't see the menu or home screen to use it what good are they? Many complaints of the home screen going blank (all white) after coming out of power save mode. You cannot fix it. If you turn it off for 5 minutes or more or pull the battery and mem chips then puttting them back in, it may come back on. Motorola has a problem with warrantying this problem also. Claim abuse or whateever they can to not replace or fix it.. buyer beware", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Piece of Junk", "Author": "Edward Behn", "ReviewID": "R3AHHXYL4NHI4T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'd had this phone for ~2 months when the display broke.
