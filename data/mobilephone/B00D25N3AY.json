{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrible coverage and service", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R2GE4E592ZSVZQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was with Boost Mobile for a little over 2 years, they were great at first but then one day I had no cell phone coverage where I lived. No bars at all for a month, I couldn't even call 911 if I wanted to, after that month I switched carriers. The customer service was totally unhelpful. I had emailed and called them more than once and they could not explain to me why I was not getting any service and they didn't refund my money back for that month. I went on facebook and a ton of other people were having the same experience. I went to their website several times and on their coverage map it showed that I had service even though I didn't. I feel sorry for people who order an expensive phone through Boost Mobile, thinking that their coverage map is accurate only to find out that they don't have and service.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$39.99", "Features": "Boost Mobile $30.00 Reboost Prepaid Refill Card", "Name": "Boost Mobile $30.00 Reboost Prepaid Refill Card", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ddeYZB6sL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00D25N3AY"}}
