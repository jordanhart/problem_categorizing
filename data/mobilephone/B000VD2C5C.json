She called me and stated she dropped her phone in the toilet (no folks, it was before use). I told her not to turn the phone on (too late). She had done the unthinkable. I just knew I would be coughing up a few hundred dollars. So, I told her to remove the battery, leave the cover off, attempt to gently dry what you can, lay the phone on it's back, wait 3-4 days and put it back together. People the phone works. All functions are a go! Samsung G600, I'll call on you anytime.", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Incredible", "Author": "Ivan Rivas \"scubapilot\"", "ReviewID": "R2M84W3D091GCK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best phone I've had, It is really usefull, with an excelent camera, takes videos, voice recorder, etc.  But being unlocked is a nice feature, because I travel a lot and can use it with a US service or at central america, etc.  Good screen, lots of contacts, bluetooth and, of course, easy to use.  Very recomendable cell phone.....", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Phone", "Author": "Carlos Guerrero", "ReviewID": "R3JWDFMD889H41", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good phone, slim, easy to carry ...
