When I lost my SLVR, I hunted for a replacement and immediately narrowed my search to Motorola as I have always been impressed with how solidly they are built and how easy they were to use. I was equally impressed with this EX122 when it arrived. Quality seemed up to standard, sound was better than expected and the touchscreen navigation and features are impressive.  That said, it is what it is - a solid little touchscreen phone that I use to make calls, listen to a little music occasionally and rarely connect to the web (slow) for directions or MLB scores.So, now it's time to hook up and transfer my hundred or so contacts to the new phone. After hours of unsuccessful attempts to connect the phone through Motorola's Phone Tools software, I connected with Motorola's support via Live Chat, which went something like this...Rhea: Hi, my name is Rhea. How may I help you?Me: I just bought an EX122 and I can't get any software to work that will sync with my PCRhea: I apologize for the inconvenience. Rest assured that we will be doing our best to assist you.Me: I have Motorola phone tools from a previous phone and it doesn't seem to workRhea: Are you trying to transfer files?Me: I am trying to transfer contact info like I did with my previous Motorola phonesRhea: I have been checking and the EX122 is not compatible with the Motorola phone tools. I apologize.Me: ok, let me understand this; I have a MOTOROLA phone that is not compatible with MOTOROLA software. Is this correct?Rhea: That is correct.Me: expressing astonishment and displeasure...Rhea: I understand how you feel and I apologize for that. If you are trying to sync or transfer contacts from the phone to your computer, we could not do that on the phone since it is not compatible.So as I sit doing a slow burn over this little glitch the number of stars I am willing to assign to this phone, and to Motorola, has dwindled to 2.If there is anyone out there who has found an alternative to sync contacts with your PC, please let me know.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Satisfaccion with the seller, amazon and so far with the phonne", "Author": "zanita", "ReviewID": "RVCQGWVFYCD1B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the package the day that they told me, I ordered different things and the put them together, that was easier for me.The phone is how was advertised, the only thing is that the phone brought just charger, no headphones, or USB cable.I am pleased with for the price I pay.I will do business again with Amazon.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$139.99", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
