Once I inserted my sims card, I was on my way to making and receiving calls. I had a problem with internet connection using the phone. Which was resolved by a visit to the local cell phone provider here in Mexico. Wifi works as it should, with no problems connecting with open networks. Two problems the camera has no flash, and the battery life drains fast. Bit of  a bummer but other wise nice phone.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "carlos", "ReviewID": "RT96P8VB6GQM6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very good phone, it's unlocked i'm using right now in venezuela and is working perfectly, wifi works very fast, the camera with a flash would be better", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "A few important drawbacks", "Author": "Craig L Zirbel", "ReviewID": "R3FMX2MZVLMZK4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is what you would expect for the price.  There are two main problems we've found in the first few weeks.  First, apps seem to be installed on internal memory rather than on the SD card we put in, so you have to manually move them from internal memory to SD memory, and this needs to be done pretty often since the available internal memory is small.  Second, we have been unable to get a data connection using the T-mobile network in Austria, despite the phone saying that there is a network connection.  One simply cannot use a web browser, etc. unless connection to a wi-fi signal (and then it works fine).", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Please read.", "Author": "Jolynne Marie", "ReviewID": "R1B93PS5EQ2WFC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG Hub is an excellent phone but only for so long. I read in other reviews that there were issues with the 3G data, I recommend that you go to your service provider and get help because it worked for both of the phones I had. The only problem that I had was that over time, the phone simply.. withered.. It would run slower, I ended up taking the battery out a few times a day. But! This all took about a year to run its course, so if you want a phone NOW and don't want to settle for a tracfone, I highly recommend this one.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good, but ..", "Author": "WILLIAM", "ReviewID": "R18QB70WU58FZ5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone doesn't run in 3G.

It's my first smartphone. I've had it for almost a month and so far, I have no complaints. It's really easy to get and works perfectly well.the only little con is the battery life. I've never tried to count how many hours it lasts but it lasts about 2days when I don't listen to music or play games. And when I do, it last just a day. But the phone has never actually shut off on me because of a low battery so I can deal with that", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$117.99", "Features": "5MP Camera (2592 x 1944 pixels) with autofocus, Geo-tagging, face/smile detection and Beauty Shot VGA@24fps Video Capture; Android OS 2.3 (Gingerbread); 800 MHz ARM v6 processor, Adreno 200 GPU, Qualcomm MSM7227T chipset, 512 MB RAM\nMicroSD Card Slot (up to 32GB support); GPRS/EDGE; Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi hotspot; Bluetooth v3.0 with A2DP; microUSB v2.0 with HS\n3.5\" TFT capacitive touchscreen display; 320 x 480 pixels resolution; Accelerometer and Proximity sensors; Gorilla Glass display; Optimus v2.0 UI; 3.5mm audio jack; 150 MB Internal Memory\nStereo FM Radio; GPS with A-GPS support; Social networking integration; Google Search, Maps, Gmail Digital compass YouTube, Google Talk DivX/Xvid/MP4/H.264/H.263/WMV/MP3/WAV/WMA/eAAC+ player; Document viewer/editor; Organizer; Voice memo; Predictive text input", "Name": "LG Optimus Hub E510g Unlocked GSM Phone with 3G, Android 2.3, Touchscreen, 5MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi and MicroSD Slot - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P9iAuvvVL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0085C3CGE"}}
