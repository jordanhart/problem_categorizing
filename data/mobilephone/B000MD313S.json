{"Reviews": [{"Title": "US Networks", "Author": "Stephen Harman", "ReviewID": "RDWEJ7NV21IFM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This unlocked cell phone can be used with a GSM network service provider and it provides tri-band connectivity (900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz).For best results with domestic Cingular / AT&T; service, select a phone that uses the GSM 850 frequency. For best results with domestic T-Mobile service, select a phone that uses the GSM 1900 frequency.Works fine on Cingular for now in many regions, but won't work in say VT where the Cingular network is entirely 850.  Cingular is apparently moving GSM off 1900 to 850 so coverage will become more patchy over time.The K800i is a 3G data-enabled device, compatible with third-generation mobile networks that offer broadband-like transfer speeds--up to 384 kbps--providing quick and easy access to audio and video streaming, Web surfing, multimedia messaging, and email wherever you go. - Note - this functionality will only work on european/ROW networks, not Cingular as the frequency is wrong.", "Date": "October 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent upgrade from 750ki", "Author": "Eric A.
