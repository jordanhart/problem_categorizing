I use this phone with AT&T;, I have a family plan with unlimited text messaging and I have a data plan (although this is NOT required unlike the iPhone data plan)I love this phone. But this isn't a five star phone.So unto my complaints first:- short battery life! I have to bring the charger with me wherever I go.- easily unlocks but hard to unlock with the touch screen pattern if you don't use tactile feedback. it feels like a glitch.- no Up and Down directional arrows, only Left and Right. what's up with that?- touchscreen is activated during call, which enables the fone to \"face dial\" or dial with your cheeks.- not stylus compatible, or you have to touch it a certain way- Using the native messaging app, you can only MMS one picture at a timeNow that I've gotten that out of the way, here's what I love about it.- The four corner, main screen application shortcuts are so handy. You don't have to flip through pages upon pages of your applications.- Timescape, having all my friend's feeds in on area.- Camera produces good quality pics- \"IM style\" messaging- sturdy construction, I've dropped it several times already and it still functions like it's supposed to. screen isn't even scratched yet. I was weary about this one since my Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G,  GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 4 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black) got so easily scratched up.- compact size, it's so cute but so functional and useful as well.- Sony Ericsson finally caved in with using micro SD HC, finally!I ordered this from Amazon with slight hesitation because it's an international version.The box is so small and contained the bare essentials.Phone, 2GB memory card already installed, international charger with adapter, earphones, and some paper with info on the phone.I checked the version right away and was surprised to see that it's already the 2.1 Android.This phone works with AT&T; but can only use Edge and not 3G, I repeat, it does not run 3G.Which might be the deal breaker for some people but for those of us with a little more patience, it's actually still faster than dial-up.I can run Pandora radio and sync my email at the same time.Must have applications:ApplanetBattery DoctorExtended ControlsBeautiful WidgetApp ProtectorOpera Mini -imho, this is better than the pre-loaded browserGoogle Voice - if you have a Google number, really useful appGameBoid + ROM Gripper - YES, you can use an emulator on this phone. And the ROM Gripper makes downloading games so much easier and almost hassle-free.Camera360 UI - if you like putting effects on your picturesThinkFree Office - comparable to a mobile version of Microsoft OfficeFeel free to message me if you have any questions about this phone :)", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Could be better", "Author": "Alan \"endospores\"", "ReviewID": "R27C5WK7DVVD41", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this to be my first android phone. At the time of this review, i've been using it for a little over 2 months.I did all the research and for the things i needed and my budget it was either u20i or a motorola dext/cliq.  I decided for this phone because the keyboard is larger and because it's so small.The phone in itself is amusingly tiny, but a little on the heavy side for the size. It has one of the smallest screens on an android phone in the market, so beware.  Personally i find the screen large enough, mostly because this phone is replacing a palm centro, that has a slightly smaller screen.  The touchscreen is very bright and sensitive even for people with thick fingers.  Very easy to handle.  The sliding mechanism at first is sharp and responsive, but it does wear down a little after a few weeks of intense use, though it's never stopped working great.The phone comes standard with OS 1.6, but Sony Ericsson launched an update recently that will install 2.1 on it, which may be a good thing for some.  However, i feel the phone worked much better and smoothly with 1.6 than it does now that it has 2.1.  Needless to say, the upgrade is optional, but it's rather hard going back to 1.6 once you've installed 2.1.Android is a great OS.  I'm liking it much more than the old palm OSs i've used and the more recent iOS by apple.  It's mighty stable, the phone hasn't crashed on me so far. It has frozen on me a few times but give it a minute and it'll get working.  I love android, it's awesome.What i like the most about the phone is probably the keyboard.  Much larger than a blackberry keyboard, wide and well spaced keys, and it's a breeze to type on it.  However beware that i asked for a phone with QWERTY keyboard and was shipped a phone with QWERTZU keyboard.  No big deal, i got used to it in a day or so, but still make sure you're getting what you're paying for.My only real beef with the phone is the battery.  Sony really dropped the ball there.  I could live with a phone being an a few milimetres thicker/longer/wider to get a better battery on this thing. I have tried everything, keeping wifi, bluetooth, location off, killing unnecessary apps, keeping screen brightness to a minimum.  One thing i wont do is turn off data traffic on the phone, as i need the traffic to be constant.  Still, the battery will last me some 5 to 6 hours on standby (with little or no talking).  I had to buy separate chargers for my office and car in order to recharge my phone working during the day.Good buy at first, but i'll probably be changing the phone by next christmas.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "3 Reasons why the xperia is better than the Iphone", "Author": "N. Sanchez \"ALeX\"", "ReviewID": "R22E4A46FW2OD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Iphone 4 why pay more?After trying out various phones such as the iphone 3g, and blackberry tour I fell in love with this phone.Let me start out by saying that I liked the phone using the touchscreen so much that I felt like I didn't really need the keypad anymore which is a bummer. So yes the touch screen is very easy to use that not even the keyboard, which is the reason I bought it, is that useful. At times when you are writing a long text to write direction sure that can be very useful, but other than that the touch screen keyboard does a great job of saying your playful texts, invitations to your house party, or hellos.Reason I got this phone over the Iphone 3GNow the reason I didn't like the iphone 3g is the qwerty touchscreen. After using a blackberry there was no way the iphone was easier to touch than the blackberry, because you don't get feedback. Some people like using the iphone keypad but who knows if they have used other phones. This is why I got this phone. This phone has a nice keyboard, and touchscreen. You get two worlds here. But like I said the touchscreen worked so nice even though this just has T9 keypad on the screen it works flawlesslyAlso after having the iphone what I liked about this phone much better is the ease of use. The iphone 3g is many times slower than this phone. However I'm not sure about the 3Gs it isn't the reason why I didn't like the iphone its just because of the keypad.Sound QualityThere isn't much to be said here. The quality sound much more fuller than the Iphone by far. So if you want to jam some music loud this is for you.Stand outMany people already have the iphone, those mytouches, the first thing I thought when I got the phone is this is going to stand out since it is many times smaller than your average phone, yet it does everything, well almost since there are some applications that don't work with this phone but I haven't encountered any that don't. You still have your common apps that work such as facebook. In the end this phone does not have that generic look many phones have, and is very stylish.CameraHands down to this phone compared to the iphone 3g. This is just as good as the camera on the Iphone 4 why pay more?QualityAnd to be really honest with you as far as the quality goes this really owns apple products. To me I think apple juts raises prices to create a demand for their products. For example the Iphone 4 has the same quality camera as this phone does. And there are other phones that surpass the quality of the iphone 4 camera such as some other Sony Ericsson phones and droid phones. Just the look, feel and smell ;) is a winner for me. Guys this is Sony.True Unlocked phoneThere really isn't anything left to be said here.Data PlanThe Iphone requires a 30$ data plan from t-mobile to use the internet. This I can just use the basic 5 dollar a month internet and get 3g speeds.ComparableAnd some might say oh my gosh how dare you compare this to an iphone. The iphone has well there really isn't anything better unless you want to use imovie, or I don't know like that bigger screen then I don't know why you would prefer the iphone. And still this isn't a who has the bigger screen contest, there is the Samsung galaxy if you want a huge screen. The reason I didn't like it is because the touchscreen wasn't that responsive, and texting was actually hard to use.Wow factorI'm really surprised that this phone is not more popular. This fun is a very fun phone to use and to have around. I highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Happy with purchase!

Loving Android!The Bad:- Total battery vampire, voracious with all its connectivity options turned on. The first day I had it on, after charging all night, the battery was dead in less than 10 hours.  Thought about doing a return, but then did some reading on the forums about tweaking settings to optimize battery life.  After updating settings, I'm getting through a day with ~70% battery, which is fine.- I purposely ordered through Amazon.com (and not one of the Amazon Merchants) to avoid vendor drama. Phone came with note stating that the package had been opened to assure that the proper chargers/manuals had been included for USA, but no USA charge adapter was in the box. That and a few other observations makes me suspect I didn't quite get a \"brand-new\" item. This wasn't a deal killer for me as the phone was in excellent condition and I had a spare adapter from another gizmo, but it left me a bit unsettled.Phone: 4 starsVendor/Buying process: 3 stars", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME", "Author": "AADR", "ReviewID": "R31QW1YQ9REGPJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "best mini smartphone in deep.came with 2gb, android 2.1, charger adapter, usb, manual, handsfree.PROS:-Size: \"MINI\" really meant it-slider qwerty keyboard takes advantage over xperia mini. xperia mini pros virtual keyboard is a non qwerty one, so you wont be using it for more than three words.-android market: access to more than 800k applications.

Waterson", "ReviewID": "R1PHA4KDKK89SU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am actually shopping for a replacement for this phone, it's just too annoying. It is a nice looking phone, small enough to be practical and is capable of running lots of interesting apps and whatnot, but it has a few fatal flaws that spoil it:I only use my phone casually, a few texts and maybe a short call a day are all I really ask of it. Despite this, the battery only lasts me one day between charges. I have turned off all the bluetooth and wifi widgets and whatnot, but the in-built battery manager tells me that the main power drain is \"idle\". This phone was new, so it can't be the battery's fault. Very poor for a modern phone.Secondly, to save the battery, the phone locks itself far too often and is a hassle to unlock, requiring a button press and a scroll of the touchscreen which is sometimes a little twitchy. This is true when writing texts as the delete button is next to a tiny space button (and I know I hit the right one, the phone tries to predict what letter you want to hit rather than just going off where your finger actually touches the screen). Also, the phonebook is atrocious for doing simple tasks like viewing someones number, but great if I want to send them a message on facebook - Arrrgh!Finally and most importantly, THE PHONE CALLS PEOPLE WHILE IT'S IN MY POCKET. This has happened on more than one occasion and is totally unacceptable. The screen lock feature clearly doesn't work. This wastes credit and annoys me and my friends. Utterly contemptible in a so called \"smart\" phone. I will not be buying a Sony Ericsson phone again.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice phone, but only so-so unless you root", "Author": "Nate R", "ReviewID": "R3N776S2QD0DKG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The biggest issue with the Xperia Pro Mini (u20i) this is the lack of voice recognition in the base software, so you're going to have to root it if you want to do things like run Google Nav via speech. I can speak right into my cheap LG Optimus V and get directions while I'm on the road, but Sony Ericsson didn't put the voice stuff in the u20i... and the only way to change that is to root. Also, things like pinch zoom also don't work by design unless you root & change the software.Now, I don't mind rooting, but you always risk bricking your device if you do the wrong thing. If I'm spending $200 on a phone, I don't want to transform it into a paperweight for something that should be in the software already. Very annoying to have to waste time on things like this.On the plus side, it worked perfectly in Asia with the Telestial international SIM card, and it's working just fine with T-Mo's Pay-go service (including the data plan) here in the US. So if you want a quad-band GSM phone that you can travel with & also use at home by swapping out your SIM card, then this will do it.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect... but not quite", "Author": "Terry O \"terryfromiowa\"", "ReviewID": "RR0JL8667Z62L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the smallest Android phone I've ever seen.  I have small hands and it fit snugly in the palm of my hand - even with the keyboard out you could pretty much text one-handed. The camera is better than I expected - it outdid my Nokia phone's snazzy Carl Zeiss 5 megapixel with the macro shots I took.  Unfortunately I ended up returning the phone for 2 reasons...The Android update from SE was fast and easy and went smoothly enough but after the update the speakers buzzed.  I might have been tempted to live with it but even the upgrade from 1.6 to 2.1 didn't make some of my crucial applications available - mainly due to the small, lower resolution screen size.  So the best feature (the tiny, pocketable Android) ended up being the deal breaker.

I wanted something that would fit into a woman's pants pocket with ease, and this certainly does.  I don't go online much to check email or browse the internet, so screen size wasn't so important to me.  It runs Android well and Epocrates beta for Android works as well, if not better than epocrates for blackberry, which I used to use.  It has a headphone jack and a fairly exceptional built in speaker (considering the small size of this device).  The audio quality for MP3 playing is excellent.  The camera is fine, but doesn't replace a point and shoot for special occasions.  Texting with the built in keyboard is fairly easy, but I am not a big texter, so I can't comment much on that.I am pretty rough on my devices and have dropped this on the floor many times, and also recently submerged it in water for about 5 seconds (toilet bowl mishap).  It has never malfunctioned despite my abuses, and actually looks really good after many months of use.Usability as a phone is fine, although the screen turns off after a few seconds to save battery, so I have to \"wake up\" the phone again to end a call.Battery life is fine for my uses- needs charging every 3 days or so.

It has wonderful features that syncs everything (facebook, twitter, etc) and updates automatically but this cant be used on only wifi. My unsureness of the phone could also be contributed to the small screen, although its really responsive, being a visual kind of person i often find myself wishing i would have opted for a different phone with a bigger screen. The dilemma would be that getting a big screened international phone would either mean a giant price tag, no keyboard or weaker software for a decent price.

I borrowed another computer from another friend with a different version of Windows, it didn't work either. I've googled for forum, tried the two different ways of updating (also, the way they describe on the website it's not the same that is prompted by the phone when you plug it in. I tried them both), spent a lot of time on it. No way of updating. I'm really upset.

Even though I was only using WIFI!AT&T; wants me to add a data plan to my contract at an additional $15 a month for 200mb. RIP OFF!I am thinking about return this phone for this reason.  This of course could be user error as the Data option is automatically enabled and I didn't turn it off when I was using WIFI.I have since disabled 'data transfer' via the phone settings. I am still using WIFI and HOPEFULLY I will not be charged for the WIFI usage.Again, AT&T; claims that a Data Plan is REQUIRED.-------------Also, for some weird reason, this phone seems to just dial and call all sorts of people for no reason.  Not sure how this happens.  But you have to make sure the phone is locked when \"handling\" the phone or leaving it in your pocket.You cannot RECORD phone calls with this phone.  Which is sucks because you can with the older Sony phones.To record audio, you have to download an APP or pay for one.  Also sucks because the older Sony phones comes with an app pre-installed.

It is really nice and it's my first phone with android software. I am a little old fashion so I actually still prefer the widows mobile based phones(there's nothing like felling as though you're holding a real mini computer in your hand). So now I have the Mini pro and an Omnia. The screen seems to respond to your actual fingure (heat respoonse) and not a stylus. That is a pro and con for me - pro: because you are sure that your phone wouldn't dial in your hand bag or your pocket which happens with my other phone. Con: because for you big figured people or you ladies with nails (which I am), this proves to be problem especially when you are roaming the net based apps and the small icons are really hard to select. The battery power is the typical sony ericson life span in my opinion as I had alot of ericsson phones in the past. 5 Mp camera is a little better than the G900 but still not up to par with other 5 mp camera phones. Sony still needs to work on that I think. I don't have any probs with the outlay of the phone and upgrading online is easy. With a memory card slot that can compete with the 16GB phones out there it's great. key board is still a challenge with nails (0.5cm long nails) but I would recomend the ladies to still buy it because it's the best small phone you'll ever get on the market. It fits in clutches, you stay connected to the social networks and navigation.

The sound clarity is outstanding and the screen is very sharp. Not sure about the battery life as I don't use it on a daily basis. While it is not as powerful in processing power as the Nexus One and G2, it's more than decent, runs fast and better than most Android phones.

Please, for the love of GOD, DO NOT GET IT. I am warning you - it is not worth it. Don't make the same mistake I did; I wish to spare you from the XPERIA X10 Mini Pro's sheer awfulness.First, its good functions. It looks cute, and can sustain a couple of drops.Next, its bad functions.It has a terrible, glitchy, dysfunctional touch screen. I can't count on both hands the number of times I've had to restart this monster because the touch screen was jumping and blinking and freaking out. It also has an all-too-frequent tendency to copy the last text I sent into the empty text field, so I'm forced to erase everything before inputting a new text. Moreover, it has an atrociously slow start-up and load time for such a small, primitive device. I got this phone because I was too cheap to purchase an iPhone or better Android - I just needed something that could text and call without many issues - and I must say, the XPERIA X10 Mini Pro fails at EVEN THAT.To unlock the XPERIA, you have to slide the touchscreen or open and close it. I've found myself so frustrated with the first option that I've gotten whiplash from flipping it open and closed because I didn't want to deal with its terribly insensitive and buggy touch screen. Also, its battery life is absolutely terrible.Please, just ... Don't get this phone. Just don't. Get yourself a Nokia if you're looking to save some money.

Example: Every time I want to end a call, I tap to hang up, and get an error message. Tap OK, brings me back to the call.  Tap to end, it works.  I shouldn't have to go through three taps and an error message EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I have to hang up from a call.  It has been like this since day 1.- camera is awful.  Photos are fuzzy unless taken in bright sunlight.  Flash stopped working recently.- screen is off-center, WTF?- GPS has always been spotty and slow.  Stopped working entirely after a year and a half.  At first, it asked me to install voice every time I opened GPS, and if I clicked \"install\", it brought me to an error message that the app I am trying to purchase doesn't exist.  Then I discovered the voice WAS installed, so I just skipped that step.  But again, why do I have to go through a series of error messages EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I open this application?????- Recently started dropping calls and not finding service.  I know it's not the service since my husband's phone doesn't do this and we're on the same plan.- came with a bunch of apps installed that I can't un-install.  Wasting space and I have to scroll through 20+ unused apps to get to the ones I want.Overall, this has worked fine for me as a phone/texting device for two years.  The camera is handy but photo quality is very poor.  Useless as a GPS device.  I never used it for gaming or MP3s, so I can't comment there.I would buy this again if the bugs were fixed, camera improved, and GPS actually worked.
