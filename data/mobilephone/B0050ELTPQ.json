I was pleasantly surprised to see a car charger, silicone and leather holster case and a second back with a minor scratch. The phone itself didn't have one scratch on it. There was a bit of confusion in terms of the shipping date but when I contacted the seller via email, he responded fast and cleared everything up; it even came a day early. I'm happy to find both chargers worked properly and cases were new. I paid $24.99 for all this and I'm definitely going to buy again from this seller.
