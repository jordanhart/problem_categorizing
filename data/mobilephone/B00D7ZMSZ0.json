My recommendation would be to buy the Motorola X phone if LTE is an absolute must.=================This Galaxy S4 Mini cell phone is intriguing. While on one hand it represents the Galaxy S4 line. It is a different beast in several respects: 1. It is smaller and much easier to one hand thumb swipe. 2. It has a beautiful clear screen albeit smaller than the S4 and wonderful responsiveness the capacitive touch sensitivity.That being said, I lament the loss of a physical keyboard (I came from a Motorola XPRT, Android 4.0) and a Palm Pre before that and a Blackberry before that. On any of those devices I could start typing and the contextual aspects would present an on-screen list of relevant items. For example, type \"Brent\" and each of those devices would start doing a universal search and present a link for BRENT phone call link, BRENT last SMS message, BRENT latest email, BRENT calendar appointment, BRENT contact record, BRENT Google search results,The S4M requires 3 taps in different areas of the screen before the keyboard is even presented. It's far more work to get to where I want to go than in my other phones.All that said, the S4M is leaps and bounds faster, more elegant, and more beautiful in almost all areas compared to my other phones EXCEPT the Palm Pre.The other aspects  of this phone that are interesting is that it comes in several versions: 1. HSPA+ w LTE (what I have), 2. Two (2) GSM slots + LTE. (what I wanted if I was on AT&T;) 3. CDMA + LTE (What I wanted if knew it worked with Sprint). I'm enjoying the T-Mobile services (i.e., free hotspot, wi-fi calling).I'd say the main drawback to the phone is all of the Samsung software that has been added on top of Android 4.2.2. So many things that have great opening screens but the integration and elegance of use with other Samsung apps or other Android apps has not been achieved.In short, I'd buy it again. I'm very happy with it after 1 month. While I believe it is hard for any review to achieve a perfect 5. This one certainly falls short in areas mentioned above and comes out strong  on other items.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "DONT BUY WITHOUT WARRANTY!!!", "Author": "Katihely A.

But when I tried to connect to my home WiFi I noticed that it didnt work, I tried everything but nothing. Since I was naive enough to by this phone without an international warranty (I live in Venezuela), trusting other reviews now Im stuck with this phone and I had to send it to a technician on my expense to see if he can fix it.Bottom line, don't buy phones that dont have warranty, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, WHY NO WARRANTY?

Great screen, too.  For those who got used to On button on the top, this phone come with the button on the side (that's becoming standard).  The only drag is the battery - so keep a charger close to you / battery barely lasts a day (but, I am a heavy user).  Also, if you are suffering from SFS or FFS (short finger syndrome or fat finger syndrome) like I do (I wear gloves size 8), then take a note: this is the last phone size that feels comfortable (4.3 in). Headphones are good and clear, but just a bit short for me (that's a matter of taste and practicality).  What else...

It is a great phone.  I cannot say how it handles games,  cause I do not play any games.  When it comes to browsing with more than 20 tabs open,  I haven't experienced any lags.  It plays videos really well  without any problems.  I can stream any videos without any problems,  as well.  Plays music without any problems and I don't have any problems with other computations.The one star deduction is for Samsung,  because they do not support phones that have been taken out of the country of where it comes from.  So you are left all alone unless you can contact a Samsung  representative from the original country that the phone is from.  I would,  also,  like to say that as someone who roots their phone,  you will not be able to receive software updates for your phone and void the warranty, but that is a given.  I'm not saying there aren't any methods.WARNING:I bought my phone from a reseller called FGS  Trading and I had the worst experience.  First off,  the shipping box that the phone came in was 10x times bigger than the actual phone and it was completely smashed.  It didn't stop there,  the phone I received had been already used and FGS  Trading gave a power adapter (because it's an international phone and plugs overseas are different than The Untied States), that had hair on it.  It was inside the crevices of the power adapter.  I was so disgusted.  I immediately contacted them and they did everything to try and avoid their responsibilities as a reseller to fix the problem.  First their excuse was that they are a small company and no would dare to put any hair,  etc.  Then,  I asked what about the box and the phone being used?  They just said that I can just get a refund back,  but then I'd have to send the phone back and pay for the shipping.  I then,  sent them pictures of how the phone came in...  You know how they replied?  \"It seems you must be hurt by this.\"  I then sent an angry message back for their lack of responsibility and how they are dismissing the points of how I received the phone.  They were completely making it seem like I was the problem for everything.  I immediately contacted Amazon... Then,  FGS contacted me back saying,  \"Oh, I see you've contacted Amazon and are going to give us a bad name and reputation.  You didn't give us enough time.  You immediately contacted them. \"  I'm like wanting to strangle someone now and reply back to them,  \"Listen F* I gave you a week and a half and Amazon has a 30 day protection return policy,  I am not waiting around. \"  I got a hold of an Amazon representative and they said that sense I didn't buy it through Amazon,  I would have to return the phone,  pay the shipping,  and they will help to make sure I get a full refund.  I got upset and said I'm not paying for s***.  I just want a new phone.  So,  in my midst of effort,  I finally got sent a new phone after contacting a Samsung representative of where my phone came from.  Didn't pay for anything.That is it.  After all that experience,  I was happy at the end.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "DOES NOT WORK ON VERIZON", "Author": "Claire", "ReviewID": "R1DZDGICERSKAI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I looked, but I couldn't find that crucial piece of info until I'd bought it, it shipped, I stayed home from work to sign for it... not until I was at the Verizon store for 1h trying to activate it did I find the small print that said it only works with T-Mobile.Will update with more stars if it returns/exchanges well, but right now, 1 star for the incredible inconvenience!", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phone was not good", "Author": "IDRISSA T.", "ReviewID": "R1G07IIPXVAV0K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone had been returned and the purchase cancelled.
