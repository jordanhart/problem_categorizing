It is very easy to use.  I have the unlimited Straight Talk plan with it. The cons to the phone are app accessibility - really a pain to try to download apps through Straight Talk.  Also, there is no video functionality - you cannot take or receive videos with this phone.  On the pro side, this phone plays music beautifully and takes somes very nice pictures.  It's a breeze to charge and holds a charge fairly well - I am on Facebook, listening to music, texting, and talking for hours each day and by the end of the day the battery is only down one bar.  The phone is very slim and the key lock function is very easy to use.  It easily fits in any pocket and is barely noticeable.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "NH Maria \"Maria A. Labarre\"", "ReviewID": "R1HEF5J59A7WA7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for about 4 months and absolutely love it. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of 5 is that this model does not do any video at all; I can't watch videos on Youtube, take videos, or receive them. Other than that, this phone does everything I need it to do, talk, text, mobile web, mp3's (with micro sd card) and the quality of the music rivals my iPod, and the camera takes surprisingly good pictures. I get coverage in about 99% of all areas I've been in; the Straight talk phones run off of Verizon's coverage areas and is owned in part by Tracfone wireless, the coverage is amazing. The price plans for Straight talk are the lowest on the market, $30 a month for 1000 voice minutes, 1000 text messages, and 30 Mb of mobile web, which comes out to about 40 hours of web use, or the unlimited everything plan, even mobile web, costs only $45 a month....that's it, no hidden fees or any of that sneaky tax stuff other cell companies stick you with.I got a black rubberized cover for my phone, which I could only find on Amazon, and the phone is still small enough to fit in a back pocket. The small keys are easy to get used to and the clarity of voice calls is perfect. Charging time is quick and it holds a charge for a long time, several days.Great phone and I absolutely love it, and with Straight Talk's low prices, I am never going back to a regular phone contract again!", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone!", "Author": "poindexter", "ReviewID": "R1GP5EREUPMZ4K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Looks like a Blackberry and is cool. This phone will do everything you need-- from fast texting to web surfing. It has crystal clear voice reception. I have never seen a phone that holds a charge as well as these Samsung R355C models. The charge lasts for ten days or more!Probably the best phone someone can buy for less than $125.00. The best part is that it runs on the Verizon network via Straight Talk. Never a dropped call, this is about as good as it gets, and the prices for monthly service is the best in the world, no one can beat it.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Some FAILINGS, CONS and PROS", "Author": "hotchas \"hotchas\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZZ2BNOJ1C1E7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Does NOT allow you to put an address in the phone directory.  Does NOT have or allow any games.  Does NOT allow any apps to be installed.  Does NOT have GPS.  Does NOT allow you to use Google or Bing maps on the browser because it does NOT allow Java Script.  This lack is a problem because it prevents many sites from showing information, e.g. IMDB works very poorly.  Does NOT block phone numbers from anyone outside of Straighttalk customers.  Does NOT stabilize pictures when using 1.3 megapixel camera.  Does NOT allow editing of pictures, such as rotation.Pro: Does allow up to 16gb miniSD card for music, pics and ringtones.  Keyboard works well even with my large fingers.  The battery life is a week or more for me who does not use the phone much, and about 4 days if I use the MP3 player, which I do daily for an hour or so.  Use earbuds instead of the weak phone speakers. The screen is a good size for a cell phone.  It is visible in sunlight by adjusting brightness.I paid $20 for a refurbished unit which came like new at Straighttalk's website.UPDATE 090512, from 3 stars to 2 stars: I found out that while on the Internet, because it does NOT allow Java script, many prices, e.g. at Amazon, do NOT show.  I do not recommend this phone any longer.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Starter Text Phone", "Author": "Tom Koz \"Tom K.\"", "ReviewID": "R15U88M89VZSA9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I admit, it is a good phone for texting and basic web browsing. Don't expect high performance, it's just not there. The phone fails to support the memory requirements of many websites and the security settings do not allow me to access sites like Craigslist. Web browsing is on the slower side, like being connected to a 56K modem. I have had to format my SD card twice when I forget to de-select personal photos as wallpaper. It corrupts the card and I have lost photos. On the flip side, it is a great basic phone although I may be moving on to something more versatile. Samsung support is neither enthusiastic or lax, somewhere in between. You might need to email them twice to get the ball rolling with any issues.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for calls", "Author": "CMW", "ReviewID": "RSI6R8RWKGLGD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Had this phone for 2 yrs, its pretty basic, good for calls. Texting is good until you reciecve a text while your trying to respond to a previous text. Internet usage kinda sucks. The camera is ok, but the display on the phone sucks.

It's a pretty good phone. It has held up even after dropping it. It does have some issues. My phone turns itself off a lot. The internet is very slow. It has to be an emergency for me to use the internet. This is not a smart phone. It may look like it, but you can't get apps. They keyboard is nice. The picture quality isn't that great.When doing mass texts, you can only send it to 5 people at a time. It will not let you go over 160 characters when texting. My last phone would just start a new text... this phone you have to send the first part, then open a new text to finish what you were saying.It has been a pretty reliable phone, but I don't feel it is worth what I paid for it.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "not sure why priced so high", "Author": "sopie", "ReviewID": "R2DMS8ZM7HP72V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am holding this same exact phone in my hand.

Then I switched to a us cellular Pantech verse. Recently I switched back to this phone because I preferred the  Straight Talk service over us cellular. Aaaaand now I really dislike this phone. It feels really small and the keys are really stiff. I had originally switched to this after a flip phone, so it felt like a big improvement.....but after experiencing another phone....I realize it isn't that great.

It's so badly chipped, I can't see the letters, I had to memorize them! It won't go into a lot of web pages, but it can go into Twitter about 50% of the time, assuming it doesn't come up with an http 404 error, or an internal error 500. Slow web browsing, the signal drops a lot, so I have to reload the page again. Call quality has been very good. A shame that I don't use phones to call often, usually text or email. It doesn't play or record video. Music quality is nice, but the player freaked out a few times. Dropped the phone once on my kitchen floor, it went out. It wouldnt function unless it was on a charger. But 2 days later, it was functioning fine again.
