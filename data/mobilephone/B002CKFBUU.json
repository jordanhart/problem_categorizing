{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Cell Phone", "Author": "M. Ulloa \"hanzox7\"", "ReviewID": "R2YS69ORQCRSWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this about a week ago from Amazon, excellent cellphone is all I can say. I considered the Z550a I was using before a masterpiece, but the W508a is even better. The phone has a slick design and it's very lightweight and low profile. The Z550a was slightly bulky in comparison.I get no signal problems and battery lasts for about 5 days with normal use. I have a Sony Ericsson HBHDS980 Stereo Bluetooth Headset that goes with it. With music heavy streaming I can use it for a whole day before it needs recharge.The headset is feature rich and I have mostly explored the music features and they all work really well. The SensMe feature is just awesome because I don't always feel like selecting 30 to 40 music tracks to listen, with SensMe the player does it for me according to my mood. The phone has superb voice quality and can ring loudly.The only complain is the external display doesn't show the clock permanently like the Z550 did. I wish I didn't had to open it to look at the clock. Perhaps a feature coming with a new firmware. Another minor complaint is that the vibration is rather weak, again compared to the Z550a. But I can still feel the phone ringing, I'll have to see if I can feel the phone ringing on my pocket when in a loud place.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$74.97", "Features": "2G Network - GSM 850/900/1800/1900\n3G Network - HSDPA 2100\nDisplay - TFT, 256K colors (type); 240 x 320 pixels, 2.2 (size); Accelerometer sensor; scratch-resistant surface\nSecondary Display - monochrome display, 36 x 128 pixels, 1.1; scratch-resistant surface\nAlert types - vibration, polyphonic, MP3, AAC ringtones", "Name": "Sony Ericsson W508 Tri-band Cell Phone - Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TxDAfIQML._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002CKFBUU"}}
