{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The good, the bad, the bottom line", "Author": "Horacio Villarreal \"Ecadese\"", "ReviewID": "R2P398ICWC7YYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Good:*This phone is durable: its been dropped (one too many times) and wet and has still lasted me a good two years or so.*I text a lot on this phone and it comes with T9 English.*Also, has a decent camera in which you can send shots to an email.*Can go on the internet to a certain extent through the phone (T-Zones).  You can only access very few sites without paying though.*Comes with \"Forgotten Warrior,\" a game which is surprisingly fun and I have beaten in just about every way possible.*Has an audio voice recorder which I have not used much, but its there (not good for recording ringtones)*Also, AIM is very usable.*Good alarm clock that usually wakes me up.*Long battery life, hasn't seem to have lost a charge even after 2 years.*Camera can be used with the phone open or closed. (flipped or unflipped).*Loud speaker phone.*Password protection to start phoneThe Bad:*Its a flip phone and flip phones are way out of style and not attractive.*Not a lot of memory, deleting texts to free up room can seem like a constant struggle.*Small screen compared to newer phones.*Can feel big and bulky compared to newer phones.*If texting, a lot of words have to be defined and or typed out manually.The bottom line:Good cheap phone to start out with.  Has all the basic features of newer, more stylish phones.  It is very durable (I dont think I could break it if I tried).  If you don't want to risk getting a new phone lost, stolen, or broken and are looking for a low tech phone, try this.  For 90 dollars it is not worth it but if you can get it at a cheaper price (Around 20) elsewhere, it is worth it.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent Phone for Just Making Calls", "Author": "Phoenix Rising \"A permanent work in progress...\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q9NNQWDPNONV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the second one I've had.

When I brought this phone I thought that it was going to receive a unlocked Samsung T229 phone; however, when I received it it was locked. I should have never brought this phone from this seller because the phone was suppose to be unlocked and it was locked. Now, I have to spend extra money to unlock that phone.

Amazon is great, but NOT the OEM shop: it has a long and sordid history of refusing to refund or resolve any problems with defective items it sells.
