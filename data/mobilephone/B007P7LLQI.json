That was great! Phone worked great until recently when my battery was at 30% and I was on the way to put it on the charger and noticed the phone had already turned off. I charged it over night, and still nothing. I then tried to reset it and switched batteries.  I also tried another charger, still NOTHING.  Hopefully I can get a replacement. Until I figure out what the problem is I don't know if I would recommend.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Favorite Phone", "Author": "IEvans", "ReviewID": "R2K7V4X9JP2MQG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone directly from T-Mobile in late 2011. I this phone worked great until about 3 months ago. I'm not sure what happened but the \"touch\" part of the phone wasn't working. I had a live background that moved so I know it wasn't the screen but representatives assured me it was a 1 in 1 million chance of that happening, but overall a great phone, in fact I'm ordering a new one as a replacement. It ran on Android which meant it had many apps, I would drop this phone all the time and it was very forgiving because it barely had a scratch. Screen NEVER cracked like so many smartphones today. Great camera, flashlight, full keyboard for texting and still a touch screen. Would definitely recommend to anyone, it's the best of all worlds.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME SMARTPHONE!  :-)", "Author": "julieandrews", "ReviewID": "R2HMSHMYOO1RRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This smartphone is amazing for many reasons!
