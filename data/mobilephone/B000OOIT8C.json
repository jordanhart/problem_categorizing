{"Reviews": [{"Title": "small and iconic", "Author": "Alan Le Map", "ReviewID": "REYCI43XL8P7I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first truly tiny and iconic mp3 phone I have seen and used. Despite being alarmed at the size of the keys, I find it easy to use, and gratifyingly small.I'll attempt to be brief. For the previous 5 years ago, I have had touch screen 3G Motorola smart phones (A920, A925 and A1000), and before that, Nokias and a Palm Pilot.No longer needing full PDA functionality, I wanted something small (for a change) with strong battery life, which would provide very good music player functionally. I also wanted: speakerphone, good quality headset, plus a tri-band or quand-band for usability overseas. I already have a good digital camera, and didn't want to carry around a phone thicker than my wallet. That meant the Nokia N95 was out of the running, despite the lure of GPS.The good* Walkman can be controlled when keypad locked, but not accidentally.* Great battery life and ultra fast charging!* Menus are easy to navigate and comprehensive.* Clean crisp screen and versatile camera features* Doesn't crash (can you tell I've had a few Motorolas?)* Handles 3.5 mm headphones* The noise reducing in-ear headphones with great soundThe bad* Minimal amount of text it will hold in contacts, notes and calendar entries - its not quite a PDA in that way* Working out how play lists work was a hassle* Minimal instruction manuals in the boxSurprises* How much I use the Blog functionality - I take a photo, type up the text and upload it to my site - very convenient diarising or blogging when on the run* The ability to auto-stitch photos into a landscape shot* The music syncing software allows you to specific (ie downgrade) the bitrate of songs being transferred so as to save space* It copes with a 2GB M2 card  despite  saying it is only upgradeable to 1 GB* Its feel very solid.VerdictElegant, small and highly functional - I was surprised as how much easier and better phones can get in just every few years. Worth the change. The in ear noise cancelling headphones have brought my mobile listening experience to a new level.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "I love this phone and I will not replace it", "Author": "Khan", "ReviewID": "R3D8L7PJCMNTX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this phone since 2008. I couldn't find a satisfying replacement with the same features in ( basic phone)here is the pros and cons:Pros:-Very small, fits nicely in your pocket-Rugged design, I dropped it many time on pavement and from moderate heights and it still functions and in one piece.-The sound quality is great comparing to the other MP3 players I had even the itouch-Memory card can be easily swapped and replaced-Battery last for a long time even after 3 years of use I only charge the phone twice a week.-Acceptable camera quality-good Bluetooth connection (better than the itouch )Cons:-I hate the headphone connection and how you have to use the sonyEricsson special headset connection, which breaks frequently. It should come with regular head phone jack like the itouch.-no enough applications, but enough for a basic phone.overall, it is an excellent basic phone , with economical price, long battery life and  good MP3 sound.If mine breaks I will try to look for similar or the same replacement.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Best Small Cell Phone I've Ever Owned", "Author": "Bob Evans \"tropicopter\"", "ReviewID": "R2OKQEL91WBZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Despite its small size and the fact that it's now a very old design, I love this phone for its size, portability and functionality. It's definitely a PDA but if you just want a small cell phone which is great as a phone, easy to text with despite its small keys and has fantastic battery life, this fits the bill.

The Wallkman interface is very useful, friendly, and the quality sound if you use a good  hearphones is a plus for avoid the carriying of another gadget, for me, this is a better choice than ipod. Unfortunely, this has no FM radio, but I knew this and agree when purshased.The camera is poor in low light conditions, the lack of flash, autofocus and poor withe balance settings dont help with this cons. In day light and outdoors it can get a good pictures, with good color and sharpness. The screen has very good resolution, more little than average but can reproduce amazing graphics and text. Phone interface come with the advantages of a sonyericsson mobile, easy of use, navigate, good features and decent life battery, althoug, no the better.The keypad is confortable, no very hard no very soft, but i must say that my fingers are thin. Design is beautiful, this SE has fine details. Is a clear All in One Gadget:Pros:Design, stainless still appearence.Thin.High quality walkman.Rubberized back cover.3G ready.High resolution screen, outdoor viewable.General Good performance.High Capacity, currently I bought 4 GB card and works perfectly (comes with 1 GB card).Good pictures from camera in good light conditions.Cons:Blurry pictures in low light conditions.Data cable and charger port is not protected by ruber cover, needs constantly cleaning.Data transfer via usb cable is very low, no USB 2.0 to memory card storage, you will need to buy card reader.Because of the thin body, the sound of the speaker is \"metallic\".", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "woW880", "Author": "B.

The size of the phone is smaller then most if not all Sony Ericsson phones and it is definately a thin phone for being a 3G phone. The only downside to the phone is the minor learning curve to using smaller buttons, but that only takes a few days to get used to.
