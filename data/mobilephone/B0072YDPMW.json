Fast, reliable, perfect size and clear screen.  Gorilla glass is super scratch resistant.  Battery life is excellent, 1-2 days no problem.  T-mobile 4G speed is awesome and the dual core 1.6 ghz makes the apps run super fast.  You can swap batteries out easily with the push of a button the back pops right off.  Access to the SIM card and Micro SD memory is also easy under the back cover.  This is overall a great phone, one of the HTC top models.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a smart phone.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "slow response touch screen", "Author": "michelle dickinson", "ReviewID": "R24L23D6HT8STF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this phone has a lot of lag with a very slow response on the touch screen.
