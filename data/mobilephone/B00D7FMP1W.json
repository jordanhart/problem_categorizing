The pictures are of decent quality but since the screen is small they are hard to see.  It is near impossible to make out any pictures that have been sent to me by other people.2. The button locking mechanism is not very effective in my pocket.

Boy, was that ever a mistake. This phone just has too many quirks, let alone Verizon will absolutely KILL you with roaming charges and other hidden fees in a prepaid plan which make it not worth the time or money.Whenever you try to place a call in a \"roaming\" zone, the phone will prompt you to re-enter the 10 digit number, all the while sucking up minutes. Customer service was unable to explain this issue.Battery life is short for a phone of this size and capability. This is in part due to the annoying backup assistant update that pops up at 2 in the morning, which does not go away by itself, and there is no way to prevent it. WHY???My BIGGEST issue is that calls and texts sometimes get delayed or just don't go through at all. It's happened more than twice now where I call voicemail and discover a new message sitting there from a few days ago. Hmmm...Other thoughts: the design is poor - it is easy to accidentally press other buttons when sliding out the keyboard, and to hit the speaker button when pressing send. Also, the picture quality of the camera is very poor.If you're on a tight budget, there are far better phones/plans out there. I ended up switching to Net10 and the difference was night and day. Customer service may not be as great, but the rates are much more affordable. No roaming charges or other \"gotcha\" fees.
