The vendor mistakenly listed it as an I9295 - the international version of the Galaxy S4 Active. It was in fact an I537 - the ATT model. It was, as listed, not locked to the ATT network, which is what I wanted, so I was not impacted as much as I might have been by the mistake. The vendor did send a couple of nice accessories to apologize for the mistake. They were quite responsive, and I will use them again.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not SAMSUNG factory unlocked!!!!!!!", "Author": "Gregory Mc Burnie", "ReviewID": "R2JRQUP07WL7UX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Phone is great, works as advertised except that when i received it I expected it to be factory unlocked from SAMUNG and it turned out to be factory unlocked from VODACOM with many useless pre installed apps.
