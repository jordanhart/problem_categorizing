My family say I'm on it so much til I don't really do anything else. I mean this phone has everything that you can think of and it's prepaid. I have absolutely no complaints about it. I think compared to the Iphone, it's the 2nd best thing out right now. And I love how it takes great pictures and it has a camcorder. I don't really even get on the internet anymore because I can do that and more from my phone.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "This Is A Great Phone For Travel and Home Use", "Author": "A. Ebel \"gccradioscience\"", "ReviewID": "R2GKBEL836XOFD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone to replace my old phone that I used to have with Cox Communications and T Mobile.  This phone is like my G1, but without the QUERTY keyboard.  The touch screen is just the right size compared to the Samsung Gem that was smaller than this one.  I still have the case for the HTC G1 and the G1 is gone so this phone now fits in the protective case like a glove, so I know this is a great replacement for my G1.  I hope my girlfriend gets one of these phones since it will help her with her smart phone needs.  This phone has a headphone jack, but does not have a mini HDMI output jack to connect to a TV.  It does not have FM radio, but can get internet radio stations and a lot of apps from the google play store.  It's like my T510 tablet, but has a earlier version of Google Android, but most apps work on this phone than my Samsung Gem.  It does load apps quick and I had fun playing games on it.  The reason why I bought this phone is because I used to be a 4 year customer with T-Mobile.  T-Mobile was charging me an arm and a leg and keeping me from upgrading to a new 4G phone.  So going prepaid will help you save more money than staying with the contract. This is good for people who want to stay out of cell phone debt and have more money in your pocket.  It's up to you!", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Verizon Illusion", "Author": "kempy", "ReviewID": "R2ECVEZ6QV1J84", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ive purchased the ILLUSION almost a month ago and its the best phone ive owned.

I figured I'd finally step away from a slide-out phone. For the first month or so, I was impressed and glad I upgraded. Now I despise this phone. Mind you, I just bought this phone brand new in the Verizon store May 24, 2013. By August I started getting the now often repeated question, \"Why didn't you answer my text?\" My answer: because I never got it. But I found out that if I logged into my Verizon account online, I could see any and all incoming & outgoing messages.Issue #2: Sometimes I'll go to the phone pad to make a call, and when I'm done dialing and hit the green button to connect, it'll go right back to the home screen. Then a minute or 2 later the phone will start dialing the number. Like wth? I was doing the phone reprogram code and/or removing the battery at least once a month.Issue #3: Yesterday I heard this really strange noise coming from my purse, and I realized it was my cell ringing. After I ended the call I tried to reset my ringtone; unfortunately it and the other 2 were gone. I called Verizon and they told me it was a device issue and gave me the number to Samsung (after refunding the amount I had spent on ringtones) The only thing Samsung helped me do was realize that all my pictures had been deleted from my SD card that came with the phone, and that entire folders had been deleted.Combined with the Kindle app only holding my place 50% of the time even when I sync'ed my place, I will be so glad to get rid of this d**n phone.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent phone for the money...no complaints", "Author": "P.

This is my very first smartphone because since I don't have a job at the moment, I didn't want to have another bill, and i know those wireless contracts get very out of control very quickly. This phone has all the bells and whistles of any smartphone- I have facebook, my email, web and everything you get a smartphone for. I use Verizon pay as you go on it- that's the best part. Just like my old phone, I buy a card from the drugstore/call and use my debit card to make a montly payment of 60.00- and that's it. No contracts, no bills, and it's actually cheaper than the old phone I had which had no smartphone capability and charged PER LINE OF TEXT... and I got to keep my old number. I finally feel like I'm with the times.The phone is easy to use, looks great, and has options galore.

He agrees that this phone isn't very good. I am tech savvy so I know that you can't expect a lot from the cheaper phones. I don't recommend this phone, not even for a kid or anyone that wants to actually use this phone to make phone calls. The phone can't handle any applications or playing games or using it as a navigator. Don't add or install anything or it will be even slower than it already is. Don't take pictures, you can't store them or share them unless you get at least 4 GB of extra memory. Don't rely on the phone to ring when you get a call, most likely you will get a voicemail of a missed call, but no alert of a call or a missed call. This has made my friends and family think I'm ignoring them, all the while I have no idea that anyone is even trying to reach me. Text messaging is not fun, the keyboard is horrible, and if you have Verizon don't expect to communicate with text messages. Most of the time they don't go through and you have to resend. If you want to share or receive a picture, it usually takes a day for me to receive or send just one.It's about as useful as a paper weight and I'd rather use a couple of cans attached by string if I had an emergency.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "services", "Author": "martika", "ReviewID": "RUU2V4PDRTUBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can this phone be used with straight talk?
