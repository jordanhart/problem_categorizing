{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good, but needs more work", "Author": "S. Roberts", "ReviewID": "R36AR10YV8UA0S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the memoir a couple years ago and put it away after a couple months. I just recently took it back out.First tho, it is a great camera with many features. Flash is great, has many adjustments. There are so many camera features and adjustments, I wont even list them, it would make my review too long. If your main feature you are looking for, second to a phone, is the camera, this is it.It is also a good phone. Not good enough to earn back the star it lost, but good. Reception is clear. But, as most phones I have tried, I can't keep a signal in my house, just a small wood frame building, but get good reception if I step outside the door.It has many widgets on the side, you can customize it according to what you use. I slid the messaging and alarm onto the main screen and others I use at the top of the bar. Good feature, very easy to customize. Although a drawback is that he touch screen is extremely sensitive, so if I want to slide one out, it might open the app.I like the multiple alarms. I need three, and there are more than that. However, in setting up the alarms, the screen is so sensitive that I end up clicking some days that I don't want as I try to scroll, so have to go back and click them off. But once set it is great. And different sounds for each one.Texting is good. No glitches, just touch the widget and it comes up. Turn the phone sideways and the QWERTY keyboard appears. I can send up to 5 photos in one text, which saves the cost of sending each separately if you don't have a texting bundle.My micro SD card slides into the side and is easily accessible.Locking and unlocking the screen is one button on the side.The phone is very user friendly, has great instructions, everything (almost) works as it should. The above are the features I use so I can't review anything beyond that.Now why did it lose a star?This phone has a special feature, which caused me to stop using it for a while. When you view the photos, in addition to the usual swiping each one, you just tilt the phone and it scrolls through them. The problem is, if you want to view a photo, the phone has to be perfectly level or it will start flying through all your photos. Then to get back to the one you wanted you have to start the search all over. This in my opinion is a BIG drawback. You cant show someone a photo unless the phone is level. Choosing s photo to send is difficult because of this feature.Besides this one problem, and an extremely over sensitive touch screen, this camera... Uh, phone is pretty good.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera first and then phone", "Author": "Fritts", "ReviewID": "R13KGN2HWHYIGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this camera, opps meant to say phone. I'm very impressed with the picture quality of the photographs. My camera/phone- is almost two years old and I am looking to replace it with a new one from Amazon- hopefully. It is not a smart phone, very basic applications, but according to some camera review magazines- this phone (camera) is probably still the best their is in the mobile phone market. Highly recommend it if your looking for a good camera with a phone attached to it.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Minus WIFI", "Author": "zack", "ReviewID": "R37S38Y31E90Y6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A good phone but no WIFI.
