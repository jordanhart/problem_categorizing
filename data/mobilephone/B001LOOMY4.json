{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Overall a great versatile handset", "Author": "csquad \"Keeping it Real\"", "ReviewID": "R1S7FGLHX13B6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my new HTC Touch HD phone a few days ago. It has replaced my old SPV M700 (HTC) with Windows Mobile 5 handset. I considered the HTC Diamond but disregarded this due to the slow TouchFLO 3D at the time (has now been updated) however battery life (900 mAh) is still bad. I also considered the iPhone 3G and the Blackberry Storm. The iPhone is fabulous, but not for editing documents etc., plus the screen resolution of the HD is near double. The Storm has a \"click\" screen which I'm not sure about.First thing you notice when you take the phone out of its box it how solid and well built it feels. Also striking is the lack of the usual array of \"HTC\" style buttons. This gives the phone a very minimalistic and elegant look. After starting it up you are greeted with the home screen of the flo menu. This now responds much faster, looks stunning and is a real asset. However the flo does not cover all the phone's functionality and it soon reveals the WM 6.1 prof. underneath. Then navigating the menus using your finger becomes very tricky. Even the fantastically high screen resolution (480x800) can't make up for this. The HD does come with a stylus (held in by a magnet) which you'll need for those occasions. The virtual keyboard is good and responsive but I find it takes some time to get use to. To sync the phone with my PC with Vista was very easy with active sync. It works very well with MS Office 2007 and Media player. I took it to the gym and found the HD works very well as an MP3 player. You can even adjust the volume with the button at the side of the phone without turning the phone back on. The sound quality is very, very good. Importing/converting vids and photos is a doddle with the media player. However I imported a video podcast and the software did not make use of the g-sensor to view landscape, why? Playback is smooth and seems good. Web browsing is a joy with the high resolution screen and Opera 9.5 preinstalled (this does make use of the g-sensor).I contacted HTC customer service and found them very helpful. If you go to the HTC website you can download the latest fixes for the phone.Good:TouchFLO 3D now fast and very usefulBuild qualityBattery lifeGreat preloaded programs e.g. MS mobile officeVery good MP3 player and video playback with fantastic sound qualityVery slim and portableHTC customer service seems fineVery good compatibility with MS VistaLooks stunning5 mega pix cameraBad:Windows Mobile rears its ugly headFiddly small buttons in MS windows mobileG-sensor does not support many prog.Only digital zoom and no flashOverall a great versatile handset.", "Date": "December 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good, but don't recommend it", "Author": "MVC", "ReviewID": "R3UO9ON9IAD05M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the Touch HD in November 2008, after some frustration with the original Iphone. On the positive side, I gotta say this is one of the most complete handsets available on the market, it has almost everything a smartphone could have: GSM quad band, 3G, wifi, large 3.8\" display,  WVGA resolution 480x800 pixels. However after 6 months of use I have to say the phone disappoints and I don't recommend it for these reasons: 1.- Windows Mobile. Microsoft has to do something about its mobile OS soon, or eventually it'll die, period. I'm not a fan of any particular mobile OS, I've used most of them (Symbian, Palm, Blackberry, Apple), and believe me Microsoft is being left behind. It doesn't matter how great the hardware is on the phone, the OS is still slow and it's simply not designed for finger-touch operation. HTC does a good job with its Touch Flow interface, but it's only a mask, in the end it's all about Windows Mobile 2.- Crappy camera for pictures and video. The camera is just too slow to focus and take photos, and video quality is mediocre. 3.- Video playback. HTC didn't include a propietary video player, so it just relies on Windows Mobile Media Player which, to be honest is even worse than the desktop version. Besides, the only videoclips that the phone plays (MP4 with H.264) have the potential for good quality but are choppy if they are in high resolution (over 640 pixels wide), needed for this screen. So if you are planning on use this phone as a personal media player (PMP) for watching movies and/or videos because of its big screen, you'll be disappointed. 4.- Resistive Touchscreen, meaning it reacts to pressure rather than touch, like the iPhone. If you have used an iphone before, you'll be wondering if there's something wrong with the screen. Let's face it: most people will consider this phone because they want something like the Iphone. Now I want to clarify that I'm not an Apple fanboy, but to be honest, the user experience is superior on the Iphone. In my opinion, Windows Mobile 6.1 is to blame. 5.- Price is very high. Sure, it comes with almost everything, but you can get better phones for much less.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "has everything", "Author": "B-House \"Married with five kids.
