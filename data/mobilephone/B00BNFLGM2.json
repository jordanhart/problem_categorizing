It  takes photos, and records like a camcorder, this includes self timer, image sequence, brightness control, effects, whitness balance, and video share call16-There is a screen on the outside so you can see who is calling without opening the phoneAppearance1-Menu functions are easy to see. 2- Colors are attractive and easy on the eyes. 3- The brightness is great. 4-Picture resolution, color,  and clarity are amazing.5-Photographs look amazing very clear, perfect color balance, sharp clear details, no bluring or distortions6-Dialing numbers in a low light situation is made easy to deal with thanks to the great backlghting of the key board which is bright. Unlike a phone I had in the past with yellow backlighting that causes eye strain this has white light like a lamp making it easy to see.SIM cardTransfering my SIM card was a snap, so you know on this phone the SIM card slides into a slot with the little gold part facing up instead of down, and is located below where the battery goes. There is a seperate slot opposite the battery for a memory cardSoundExcellent very clear, no static or distortions. hearing people talking is easy, volume control is great and easy to adjust thanks to the volume up down key on the left side of the phone. Reception is very good, there are also a nice selection of ring tones to choose from. You can also turn on or off the key beeps which I love hearing beeps with each key pressed drives me nuts", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Functional", "Author": "A.

For example, the simplest of things like checking your messages, checking who's called, changing ring tones, texting numbers, writing a text, etc. are burried under layers and layers of menu options.There is, however, a programable \"go to\" button on the homepage where you can file all the functions you want in one place so that may be what Nokia has in mind for users access.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "luz marina", "ReviewID": "R1BDGOTAFTOIRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent product very good quality is what I expected when I decided to purchase this product I recommend very phone for purchase an smart phone", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works!", "Author": "robert michael sparks", "ReviewID": "R143OIG6S1FV8K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It does what it should........whats not  to like!

I had ordered another, spare, battery and that worked a little better.  Through Amazon, I contacted supplier and asked for a replacement battery since original couldn't be charged,  Supplier sent a new phone, AC charger and battery. Amazing!!  It all works well now.  However, I still like many of the features of my very old quad-band Motorola RAZR V3 (address book is better organized, changing ring to vibrate, silent, etc is easier ...) more than the Nokia 6350.  What's better about the Nokia is it's \"3G\" and can work with our AT&T; micro-cell tower at home which vastly improves home reception.  I had no trouble simply switching the SIM card from my old phone to the new phone.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "It is wonderful works good I LOVE it. it is a very good product and I Will shop again here.", "Author": "Gary Curfman", "ReviewID": "R3HNQEH6V3EJ5B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is wonderful works good I LOVE it. it is a very good product and I Will shop again here.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "dies hard", "Author": "jim blick", "ReviewID": "R3J9B0OO7IKSW1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "when the battery becomes fully discharged,the phone does not want to charge and turn on.  this has happened twice so far.  got lucky and it turned on the first, but the phone is still dead after the second time. phone is only 2 months old.  other reviews say the same.  also the software is clunky--too many clicks required to do simple functions like call a contact.  voice recognition has been horrible. stay away from this phone.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Good Phone", "Author": "Glenn", "ReviewID": "R2XLQXO7BT7K57", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nokia 6350 is a good phone for individuals who do not want a smart phone.

Although you can use it to take pictures, listen to music, and check your email, it's main purpose is to make and receive telephone calls.  In that respect it works fine.  I had an earlier version of this phone for many years and decided to replace it only because the battery was nearing the end of its life.  (A new phone was cheaper than a new battery.) Because it is unlocked, it also works in Europe with a European SIM card.
