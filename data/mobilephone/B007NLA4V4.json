It's small, battery is good, screen is way bigger than my old KRZR K1, so I'm really happy. Wi-fi is fantastic bonus for Facebook, email, google messenger, etc when i'm at home or at the coffee shop. GPS works great. Phone is fast and very responsive. Camera is just 2MP fixed focus, but takes good enough point and shoot pictures.If you are buying this for data, keep in mind it will do EDGE, but not 3G, this is a foreign market the 3G is HSDPA 900 / 2100. It uses different frequencies than North America for 3G (hardware based, not changeable) so that doesn't work here.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small and handy", "Author": "Yuval", "ReviewID": "R2AHQGBWHDRI3X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is a small galaxy that fits into my pocket (hence the name)Camera is low than avarage but I do not need it so it is oKAs it is not the strongest in the world it should be well managedlike closing applications and make sure you do only one thing at a timeAndroid is greate so all inall it is a nice and good phone that comes at low price", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lucky Choice", "Author": "S D Bradbury", "ReviewID": "R30C0FRMKZ326M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purpose was having a device when needed in international tourism travel, without being tied to a vendor or service company.

I bought it for its size so I could easily slip it into my pocket and it does that just fine.  It has good wifi capability and the built in radio works nicely.  So far I have had only one problem, it did lock up once and refused to power down - I removed the battery, put it back in, powered it on and it has worked fine since.  I replaced a t-mobile dumb phone and simply transferred the sim card to this phone with no problems.  If you want this phone for mobile data, with t-mobile it will operate no faster than edge.  I don't know how it works with AT&T.;  I don't use it for mobile data, satisfied with using wi-fi for data as spouse has a data plan on her phone.  This phone has acceptable, but not great, speed - enough for my purposes.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just perfect", "Author": "Martha Barrantes Prado", "ReviewID": "R3607C5K8PM1FY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love IT !

When I find the time will read the manual, so I can try to maximize its full potential. One major draw back, is the fact that the screen is very small, I know it had said \"pocket,\" but was looking for something a bit bigger.With this issue, it makes it a bit difficult to write texts, as the keys are so small and close together; when pressing the keys, I find that the wrong ones populate, which makes me have to go back and erase and that takes up a bit of my time.I will continue to use so I can see if this improves.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "just what I wanted", "Author": "Daniel Franco", "ReviewID": "RJJAVVKC2DP5L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent product, just what I wanted, simplicity and functionality, good speed Wifi connection and Android have many applications I can download .. internal memory a bit limited but you can place a large capacity MicroSD", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cute phone", "Author": "Leticia", "ReviewID": "R12J8VLRV5S4AP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this phone, but sometimes the touch pad on the bottom does not work so I have to turn the screen off and the on in order for it to work.

I prefer to use my actual computer for computing needs, plus I'm cheap. So until recently I'd been rocking an old slider / bar phone, and quite enjoyed the simplicity and long battery life (around 4-5 days between charges, but I'm also a minimal phone / text user). When shopping for an entry-level smartphone my priorities were small size, low price, and good battery life. This thing nails all three. It's actually slightly larger than I'd expected, but it's small enough to very easily fit into a pants or shirt pocket without being a nuisance. The very few things I use it for work well (calls, texting, email, music listening, flashlight, and timer), and when I went on a trip recently I watched a few movies on it and it was a decent experience. Anyone planning on watching movies: you'll need to convert them to 320x240 or the phone won't play them, I personally recommend \"Miro Video Converter\" for the task, just pick the Android->Samsung->Galaxy Mini setting.On the OS front, I had been expecting 2.3 based on the listing here, but it actually has 4.0.4, so that was a pleasant surprise.My only gripe with this device is the audio output - it works just fine, but is very quiet. Even at max volume I couldn't hear some things particularly well while riding a bus or subway, while with other devices this has never been a problem. If there's a way to crank up the output a little then I'd judge this phone to be perfect for my purposes.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK as an entry-level phone", "Author": "Freezerburn", "ReviewID": "R2360HYHPZE4CU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Several months no problems at all.
