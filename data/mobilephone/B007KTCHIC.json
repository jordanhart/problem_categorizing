{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty nice purchase!", "Author": "GoldenLady", "ReviewID": "R3A0F9ACJH7U4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I'd like to say this was a very speedy transaction!  I ordered this phone early Friday morning and I was using this phone by Monday afternoon!  I believe this is the first time I've ever received something the following business day for what would normally have taken a week or more to ship!  I wanted to make sure I didn't boob dial anyone and those big huge phones that look like mini flatscreens are not \"all the rave\" when you're worried all day about dropping it or making sure the screen isn't vulnerable to damage.  The Flipout is lightweight, it's got the slide feature so it's MUCH better than the clam-shell styles. Definite KUDOS!  lol.  I love the phone, it serves it's purpose, it's so compact, talking & texting is a breeze, and when I feel like surfing the web, DONE!I've noticed that my battery drains really fast, but I've learned that turning off the wifi feature when not in use, and switching into battery saver mode helps.  Also, I do realize this phone is running on an earlier edition of the android market . . . so I'm having trouble putting \"untrusted\" apps on here that aren't available through the normal market.  (I'll find a way around it SOON).  I think I'll possibly purchase a back-up battery just incase, because I'm not always around an outlet.Hope this review helps at least one person!  I'm pretty satisfied with the phone, however . . . the carrier I have this service with right now makes it a little undesirable, so MAKE SURE the carrier you get with this phone offers more than 0 - 2 bars of service.  (another story for another time!) :)", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A nice little Android phone", "Author": "Aneil Seerattan \"Aneil Seerattan\"", "ReviewID": "R192B94RGHXSKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is a great introduction to the Android OS, especially for a young child.

It was cute, it had a touchscreen and qwerty key board (still love that). It was small, it had a camera, it had internet capabilities (though slow) and it was functional.  Later on different functions began to have some problems.  First what I noticed was that the micro SD card that I had in the phone eventually failed to register.  I have a permanent error symbol on my screen as it says microSD card can't be read.  I've tried different cards and none of them have worked so that isn't the problem.  The next problem that occurred was that the camera stopped working, or at least the application did.  The phone would freeze every time I accidently hit the camera application.  These problems occured within the first two months of buying the phone.  Later I found that my phone has grown too slow to process any type of internet pages.  It's time for a new, better phone", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for a quick replacement", "Author": "Hava", "ReviewID": "R5FH00EAWV9YA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My Blackberry was acting up so I bought this. It's quite durable, and runs perfect for the first two weeks. Then it starts to freeze up on you (turn it off, turn it back on). Soon it froze up about twice a day. My new(ish, it is a hand-me-down) phone does the same thing, and to be honest it's completely normal. But 2-4 times a day? Whoa, not THAT normal. I'm sad to say that the battery lasted for three or four hours if used constantly, and only 2 hours if the wifi was on (not even connected to a network!) Also, ignore the Data counter thing in the settings, because it counts the data you would have used, even when your on wifi. An overview: you have to restart it constantly, the battery does not hold it's charge very well, and its an ok buy if you plan on using it for only about 3-4 months. I wish I had some good things to say, but the only thing that would even fit into the \"cool\" factor was that people would comment on it and say it was cool looking.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "if you want to stand out get this.", "Author": "jonny", "ReviewID": "R2H1O7SMUOX775", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i stricktly use my cell for texting and calls only thats what they are for SO this phone does both very nicely !everyone with an iphone will look as you get a call and FLIP !!!! they can't belive that little square is a cellphone, I get alot of looks with this cell. i love it  !!! will buy another once my current one dies out.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice product.", "Author": "Lazaro Grullon \"3men2kbson\"", "ReviewID": "R162OSNFLPGDKL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is great, it feels fast, very customizable because it uses android, has very good sign, easy to use and carry, my wife is happy with it.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "so flipping cute! (heh heh)", "Author": "moi", "ReviewID": "R1JZSCGZM1X5VQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this phone. it is ridiculously cute in person and quite the conversation starter. that said, it is has some failings. a)  I find the battery life to be pretty short. if I'm out all day and using it, it will invariably begin to die. I don't know exactly how many calls I can get out of it before it dies, but, it's not that many. b) checking my email and facebook on the phone is really inconvenient. the idea of searching the web for something is ludicrous. the screen is just too small and the controls, to me, are not intuitive. I'd sooner do those things on an ipod touch or on my computer. c) the camera is horrific. I don't even bother. the images that come loaded on the phone are way better quality than I could ever get on the phone, so I just leave them as my wallpaper.the pros are that it is really cute. call quality, in my opinion, is great. there are tons of options for ringtones- very important to me. overall, for what I paid- around $120, I'm thrilled. if I wanted to buy a great smartphone with tons of features, I'd buy an iphone. since I didn't want to spend the money and wanted something cute and cheap, I am very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Resolution for Motorola MB511", "Author": "Alice Ta", "ReviewID": "R6086RXZUXI1Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "1/ Could install an application in external memory ?2/ Could improve the battery consuming time ?3/ Could upgrade the hardware to increase internal memory (new version)?", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "hi", "Author": "hani", "ReviewID": "R2FFMLO59F14DW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I do not think that was totally new mobile phone I have found there are many fingerprints on the device", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007KTCHIC"}}
