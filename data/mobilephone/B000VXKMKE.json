I give this phone a 4 for the features. It's great being able to upload any of my favorite songs to use as ring tones and I love that it came with both head phones, the micro SD AND the appropriate usb hook up. The camera is also amazing, After uploading the photos you can hardly tell that they were taken with a cell phone.My only gripe (and reason for giving a 4 not a 5) is the craftsman ship. Internally the phone is sturdy. It has a great speaker awesome sound quality and user friendly software. It's jut the outside that can't stand wear and tear (especially if you tend to drop things). I've dropped it twice and on the second time it fell face down and the front slide bar cracked (and partially fell off). That feature of the phone still works but the aesthetic is damaged. I had a feeling that it would happen. Protruding parts on the front of phones always end up damaged sooner or later, I wish the company had considered that.", "Date": "September 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "The phone is originally T-Mobile", "Author": "Enmanuel", "ReviewID": "R1L7Y6QVHQTL32", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone (Sold By OEM Shop) is originally T-Mobile the seller does not include headphones or Memory Card Cell offered by T-Mobile.

We're with AT&T; and the phone is originally a T-Mobile phone. It is a good looking phone and my wife likes it, but I can't figure out how to get it to send/receive MMS messages on the AT&T; network.

It only records about 15 seconds of video.  The camera is slow to save data after snapping the shutter.  Recently, the phone began turning off and on at random and the only way to stop it is removing the battery.  Even then, it sometimes keeps doing it.  This phone has also been known to turn itself on in the middle of the night.  I tried looking for updated software from Nokia, but when plugged in to their website, I get a message saying that the phone already has the most current software.  I found no warranty information on the box, in the box, or in the manual.  The manual had no diagram pointing out the various parts of the phone, which made it difficult to determine how/where to insert the SIM and micro SD cards.  The FM radio has poor reception, even in downtown Los Angeles, home to numerous broadcasting stations.  NPR was impossible to receive.  It was otherwise OK when it was new, but I'm now sorry I bought it.  This phone is an mbarrassment to Nokia.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "phone", "ReviewID": "R23CFH9SNFHCSU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it is the most bad phone in the world because the first day i receive it the mice was not working and it says that the phone without warranty", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "Jorge Leon Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R2QKBG40933XZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone, it works very well with the music, videos and blue tooth.
