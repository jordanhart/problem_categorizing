Yes, you can get this phone cheaper through Walmart.  But this phone works just fine.  I haven't had any problems. Why spend a ton of $$ on another phone when this one does all the same things.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst phone I've ever owned...", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R10EU1SO6U5AST", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Swtiched from Sprint to NET10 because of service issues. Love NET10 as a service. Of course you have to pay for any phone right out with a pre-paid company. You get what you pay for. I wanted something cheap in case I didn't like NET10.For starters. The battery life is great. That's the only thing that is good about this phone.Camera has no flash.3G doesn't work 4/5 times.Screen freezes while trying to open a program or app.Screen freezes during calls so you can't mute/unmute/hang up/answer.There is NO memory on the phone.I have 1 GSP app. I tried to download the Facebook app but it wouldn't work properly due to using so much space on the phone, so I had to uninstall it and use the normal browser to look at Facebook.I uploaded Instagram and had the same issue.There is a lag when tapping the touch screen. The keyboard doesn't work when you go to type a text half the time. Resulting in turning the phone on and off. When you do that the spell check doesn't work. So you have to reboot again to get everything to \"work properly\"...Going for a new phone today. Going to spend a little more since I'm happy with the service. I will be throwing this phone on the concrete as hard as possible and possibly using my neighbors sledgehammer to destroy what's left. I hate it that much.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "3.5\" Touchscreen, Android (2.3), 320 x 480 pixels Resolution\n3.2 megapixels Camera, Camcorder, Music player, Bluetooth\nInternet browser, CDMA (800, 1900 MHz), GPS, WiFi (802.11 b, g, n)\nAccessories include Battery, Charger, USB Cable, 2GB MicroSD Card and User's manual\nThis phone required $45 plan card from Straight Talk (Sold separately)", "Name": "Huawei Ascend Y Prepaid Cell Phone (Straight Talk)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310qb%2BPnHJL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009Y103AI"}}
