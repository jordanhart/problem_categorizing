My previous phones include Tmobile G1, Tmobile G2, Sony Xperia Sola, and now this sidekick. I always prefer qwerty keyboards on phones and those are few and far between. So now let's get down to business.Pros:  1. Screen- vibrant and clear colors (no complaints here)  2. Keyboard- keys are nicely spaced out and not scrunched together like on the G2. They have a nice feel to them as well  3. Android OS- Froyo runs very smooth, no lag or bad spots like on my Sola; currently running dolphin browser mini  4. Slide-hinge- unlike the G2, the sidekick has a sturdy hinge and gently slides up at an angle. The G2 had a problem with the sliding mechanism getting too loose and my G2 sliding out by holding it up  5. Speakers- Good sound, not nearly as loud as my Sola, but pretty nice sound  6. Trackball- just a trackball but secured  7. 4g- Blazing fast and I'm pleased with the speedCons:  1. Occasionally the screen freezes, but only when I'm at work sweating with it in my pocket  2. Tons of unnecessary tmobile bloatware  3. Physical buttons- kind of odd placement for the home, back, menu, and shortcut buttonsOverall this is a splendid phone and I'm pleased with my purchase. I haven't had ANY MAJOR problems with this phone and I also want to say kudos to the seller for accurate phone description.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone sucks.", "Author": "J.", "ReviewID": "R1DIWZ1J16BC49", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It freezes whenever it wants, the battery dies fast, it reboots whenever it feels like it and sometimes eats a huge chunk of battery after it reboots so you'll have to re-charge it again..", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "got rid of this phone", "Author": "cathy munsey", "ReviewID": "R9TORA6HB2NYY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this phone is terrible!  it kept freezing up on me and i was losing calls.  i had an accident in the pouring rain and i tried to call my insurance agent and it froze up on me.  i had to remove the back of the phone, take the battery out and replace it for the phone to work again.  i kept losing calls too.  it would drop calls in the middle of a conversation.  i got another one and it did the same thing.  the people from amazon did give me a full refund.  they were very nice about it.  i loved the qwerty board.  wish it would have worked because i really liked it.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buy it?

Needless to say, I happened upon this phone.When I first received it, I absolutely loved it, but the phone was somewhat laggy which I was able to correct using a Kies Mini update for Sidekick 4g, which you can download off the internet. All i had to do was plug it in via usb and update the software. After that, my Sidekick was operating twice as fast.Another thing to note is that the only app I have on my phone that I downloaded was zedge, for ringtones and what not. If you're looking to use this for social media, heavy browsing, or heavy gaming, chances are you might want to take your cash and spend a little extra somewhere else.There are also some issues other sidekick users had with this phone. The sidekick 4g seems to be prone to some sort of bug that makes it restart over and over again and burn up the battery doing so. I actually had that problem just a few days ago and almost had to switch back to my last phone. However, upon removing my sd card and my sim card, i decided to turn on the sidekick again. All of a sudden it was back to normal and I was able to use my sidekick 4g again without it crashing or restarting randomly. Of course I can't guarantee that it would work for anyone else that comes across this problem but the sidekick 4g is by no means a bad phone.I absolutely love the way it looks, even though some might feel the buttons are awkwardly placed (doesn't really bother me) but the keyboard is probably it's distinguishing feature since it's probably the best keyboard I've ever used on a phone. It's perfect for any frequent texter. Not to mention that the touchscreen keyboard can also use Swype.Another thing to note is that I really dig the user interface and the overall layout and style of the screen. It's slightly custom and relatively unsignificant, but I honestly have a lot of problems with the bland, relatively boring/ugly user interfaces of other phones like the normal android style and bland apple setup. Just my opinion.To sum it up, I'm happy with my purchase.Pros:Phenomenal KeyboardUnique user interfaceGood looking phoneCons:Might encounter some software problemsSlightly bulkyAwkward button placement", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "gGREAT", "Author": "Litisa Mcmillan \"realsharntay\"", "ReviewID": "R1CFMU34GFDBLI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THANK YOU IT WAS FAST AND FURIOUSWORKING GREAT.

It does have its problems- sometimes freezes, if I'm trying to do too many things at once. Does use up the battery fast, if you don't dim the screen. Screen is very sensitive - easy to hang up a call while dialing (most of those problems are caused by me, not the phone).To stop the glitches and freezes, clear the memory and close programs. Pretty simple. Also, clear web browser cache and cookies. The biggest complaints I have are the cost (Tmobile kinda screwed me when we moved and renewed our contract - got signed up for 2 years and had to pay full price for the phone, instead of a cheaper upgrade) and that it is hard to see the screen in bright light.The camera and video are great.
