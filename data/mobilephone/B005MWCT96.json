World traveler, it has worked at every location, no dropped calls or problems with connecting to different service providers.

Easier to access the battery, SIM and memory chip with the one touch removal of the rear case.

Harsh, but I think it is a disgrace that Blackberry can lie so blatantly on their published phone specifications about their battery life......They quote 15 days standby time: it's about 15 HOURS.....They quote 6.5hrs talktime: you might get an hour......Normal use, with screen permanently dimmed, wifi and blutooth switched off, GPS switched off, all apps closed, 50 min talk time, is half a day (longer if you don't actually use it).Others who are familiar with smartphones probably won't be surprised. I haven't had a smartphone before, I trusted the specifications. I was conned. How can they get away with lying on their spec sheets? What do we believe if we can't believe the spec sheets? One star is punishment for lying.Other than that it's a great phone. Probably 4 stars. I wouldn't have been so angry if they'd said up front that's what the battery life was. Why don't they instigate something like the standard 'urban' 'extra urban' fuel consumption standards on cars, and put their competitors' products through the same tests so they're not disadvantaged. Be the first to be honest and win market share Blackberry!Comments on other things:First rate typingThe ability to type fast on the touch screen, particularly with the well thought out \"reduced keyboard\", is phenomenal, and immediately intuitive - no learning curve. This is the number one feature for me.... but why does the keyboard automatically switch to multi-tap in email fields on contacts? I hate that. Change it please! I have to type emails in another field and cut and paste them into the email field which is faster.The layout and intuitive nature of all the controls is excellent.Camera is okbut why not let the intuitive button on the side of the phone be the photo-taking button? Then you could use it with one hand. And why does it sometimes just refuse to take a picture when you are pressing the button for a great, and fleeting shot? Stress! And of course the battery gets low and it won't take a picture then either. And why not allow zoom during video?Dialling is greatbut with two niggling, easy to solve flaws. (1) Currently you have 4 totally unnecessary keystrokes just to start typing the person's name when you open the phone app. Easy to fix: allow user to set which tab comes up first (keypad, recent or contacts), and on contacts tab open with cursor in the search box and the keyboard up. (2) Weird thing where if you start typing a person's name, they appear on the screen, and you hit their name on the screen, it jumps up and dials the person at the top of the screen. Maybe this is just a bug in my phone. It's damn irritating!Needs a force-quitOS needs an app like task manager in windows. There are nearly 60 hidden apps you can't delete running permanently in the background! Surely they aren't all necessary, and they use battery. An app showing app specific battery consumption and allowing you to force quit apps would be a dream.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone works well but miss some items", "Author": "Rafael Panesso", "ReviewID": "R3K3KOF8WSGPNZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone works very well, but I feel kind of disappointed because the phone came without north american charger format, also the phone must came with 8GB micro SD card inside as is discribed in blackberry web page, but it doesn't.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Blackberry", "Author": "Baby Pink", "ReviewID": "R2MNP127OD6Q7X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was by far the worst phone I have ever had.

If you're not - it's a waste of money.  Any other phone in this price class has a glass screen (plastic?  really RIM?); a front facing camera no BB has this; at least 8 gigs of application storage (256 megs after OS load is a joke; WIFI hot spot....  In fact there are so many devices in this price range that have dual core CPU's and 4G that one wonders how much the profit margin is on this phone.  Compare this to the 9900 - a really nice glass screen (though tiny) aluminum band around the midlle.  The raised plastic buttons make this thing as ugly as sin.*So the plastic has held up pretty well - but still not as nice as glass.As for software.  * Software updates, addittions to older programs (BBM now has voice calls) and new programs BB Navigation, have brought the software side up to where it should have been 2 years ago.  Just in time for the release of the Z-10.It's blackberry 5.0 + 2.  Nothing really new or creative here.  The web browsing is better and almost on par with the other platforms.  But there will be NO THEMES for OS7, the new hardware broke the theme studio and it can not be fixed.  There will be no upgrade to BBX -which will be out in less than a year, and as such there will be little in the way of app development for this platform. It has no flash support, and it never will.  Most of the web animation and video is still flash based and so this device will never give you the full web experience.Performance - *Again - OS fixes have really helped,but its underlying programming is this devices downfall.  Much like its true predecessor the Storm line (which by the by had a much better fit and finish), the device has its moments.  And it can be fast, but it is still based on a Java Kernel that was built around the time Reagan/Bush was in the White House.  Try to load a Java heavy web page and the phone will hour glass.  For e-mail, facebook, texting and accessing some music or pictures - this device works just fine.  But I need to ask why would one spend the same money for a an Alien Ware gaming PC as for an e-machines bargain bin PC?", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Me llego el articulo  a Venezuela en excelentes condicones!

The screen is a bit smaller than some other full screen smartphones,but the benefit of that is the whole phone is smaller and very pocketable.Also since the battery is removable, I can carry a spare and not worry about running out of juice.(You can't remove an iPhone's battery)So far I like this more than my Bold 9900 which for some reason uses up more power than this.It has never frozen up so I'm not sure why other reviewers say it does.I'm guessing user error and they probably never updated the software like they are supposed to.My only complaint about the BB OS, is that there is no official Skype App, and no Netflix App for it.Hopefully the new BB10 phones coming out in 2013 will take care of that short fall.", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointing Smart Phone", "Author": "IslandDave", "ReviewID": "R1WP7K9Y07TNRI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Blackberry Torch 9860 Unlocked Phone with 4GB Internal Memory, Blackberry OS 7, 3G and 5MP Camera - International Version (Black)This was my 3rd Blackberry.I like Blackberry Phones for the same reason they became so popular in the first place; the QWERTY keyboard and simple utilitarian software designed for push email and Blackberry messaging along with web site access is easy and quick to use.This model is almost pure touch, there are however, four main physical keys and a track pad at the base of the touch screen. Some people may have wished for the phone to be completely touch in order to streamline it more like the Galaxy or the Iphone it is trying to compete with.On my phone I had issues with these key functions lagging and locking especially the go-back key.
