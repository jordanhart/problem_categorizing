{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Very Good Deal For This Big Key Phone & 1 Year of Airtime", "Author": "MJNC367", "ReviewID": "R2WEHMLHTHDAO8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone on amazon for $19.99. I had a lot of airtime on my old tracfone, so I didn't need an airtime card. Just the airtime card alone costs the same as this deal with the phone & the 1 year card. Like getting the phone for free. And It is a fantastic phone. I'll give a quick rundown, as I've already posted a pretty lengthy review.I've had tracfone for 12 years now, and this is the best phone I've had. It has a large bright display. The number keys are large and brightly lit. No more tiny buttons to fumble with. The phone has a very comfortable feel in your hand, and it's thin enough to easily fit in a shirt pocket. The FM radio has a jack for headphones/earbuds. The radio is FM stereo and sounds excellent. You can preset stations. It has a speakerphone which is loud and clear. You can attach one of those camera type wrist straps if you wish.Now the cons in my opinion;  #1-No jack for a headset or bluetooth capability.  #2-The very miserly, pathetic manual/instructions.  #3-You must enter a menu to change modes from ring, vibrate, and silent (airplane mode).  With my old Motorola, as you decreased the volume, the next to the lowest setting put it in vibrate mode, and the lowest setting put it in  silent mode. In my opinion, a much easier and sensible setup.  If you text, it deducts 1/3 of a minute per text message. It is very easy to use and I highly recommend it.  You can't go wrong if the features meet your needs.  Thanks for reading. I hope someone finds my review helpful in making a buying decision.____________________________________________________________________******UPDATE 12/12/13- A lot of people have asked if this phone has a cover over the keys, which it does not. There is a new version of this phone called \"The Big Easy Flip\", model # 392G. The keypad is the same, but the screen is a lot bigger, and it has 3G/WiFi, a 2 mp camera, bluetooth, mobile web access, FM radio, MP3 player, micro SD card, external caller ID and time window, and more. On Amazon it is $19.99. The link is below for anyone interested.This looks like a welcome improvement to an already great phone, even if you don't need all the other extra features.---> Alcatel 392G \"The Big Easy Flip\" Prepaid Phone With Double Minutes (Tracfone)********************************************************************", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the elderly.", "Author": "S.

My 81 year old dad likes this phone even if it is not a flip phone, that is really what he wanted however their was not one for his area according to Tracfone.  For some reason it is hard to find a flip phone anymore, what's up with that? We bought him an LG800 at first, thought he had to have one since all of grandkids have touch phones, what a terrible mistake that was but he knows now that a touch phone is not for him. Anyway, he does like this Alcatel phone, very easy to read and very easy to dial, he likes the fm radio on it but he does miss the camera on this phone, oh well, you can't have everything, what do you expect with a Tracfone.  So far so good!", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT price, very tough, no monthly bills", "Author": "Ed Carey", "ReviewID": "R25CPMZ7MGO7Y1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first cell phone and VERY pleased with it.  Many friends have smart phones, with high cost and monthly bills. But I like the Alcatel's low cost, simplicity, and big buttons on the keypad  (don't have to put my reading glasses on to make a call).  This phone does NOT take pictures or surf the Internet or add app's.  If you like all those extra features, this is not the phone for you.  But it is great for making telephone calls, receiving calls, and text messages.  Very good clear sound, good reception, and very dependable.  I highly reccommend it !", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Juat what I was looking for", "Author": "Mary Hough", "ReviewID": "RHF8J17H1MZHD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a phone that was reasonably priced and without all the bells and whistles that come with so-called smart phones.  It provides just what I wanted. I just used it for a long road trip, and it gave me clear connections to those I was traveling toward and those back home.  It even worked well up in the mountains of NC.  The buttons are large enough to read and the unit is very easy to use.  It has voice mail and should I know how to do it, I could send a text.  The price and ability to use the time over a year make this a very attractive option for me. The double minutes for life mean that it will continue to be affordable.  I did have a problem at  first as the battery would not hold a charge.  The vendor from whom I got the phone gave excellent service to get me a new battery.  They would have sent me a new phone should I have needed one.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I have ever had!", "Author": "John P. Giusti", "ReviewID": "R341YO4B2MT13G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is free with the 1 year of service Tracfone card it comes with. It is easy to use and easy to hold on to. My last phone was all smooth and slippery. After 3 day it only used up half of the battery. It comes with a charging station so I do not have to find the right cord and plug it in. I just drop it in the charger stand. The manual could be better but the phone is easy to use so I had it up and running in a short time. I am vary happy with it as I have not had the phone go out of reception area.
