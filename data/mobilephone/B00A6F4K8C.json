{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beautiful phone, but, way too many lags", "Author": "evds22", "ReviewID": "R24M5K1DWHB1U7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:1. Very beautiful phone, striking resemblance to the Xperia T the Bond Phone. You will fall in love with it as soon as you see it.2. 4-in display with decent ppi, matches the Retina display of ipod Touch 5. I don't really mind that but this can be important to others.3. 1750mAh battery produces one of the most impressive battery performance in the Xperia family: I messed around with updating and downloading apps for the whole night and the battery level only dropped by 18%. Drops about 2% with WIFI and data off during the night.4. Upgradable to 4.1.2 Jelly Bean.(But the upgrade comes WITHOUT the battery stamina mode as seen on Xperia Z, which is basically why I would ever bother checking for this upgrade.)5. Camera takes decent pictures with 5-megapixels. Lots of options available. Adjusting exposure level, among others, is the most helpful.Cons:1. User interface experiences lags from time to time, i.e. when swiping through home panels, which from my perspective can be tolerated given its almost pathetic chipset.2. When I tried to open and work on two webpages at the same time, specifically Google translate and Wiktionary as I'm learning a new language, the phone was slow to response. It took a good while to reach google translate, and it became a hellish journey trying to open a new tab and reach Wiktionary. This is the deal breaker. I did make sure to use ES task manager to close unnecessary background processes. I won't consider other browsers as integration of Google products is the only reason I can even bear the Android system.3. Back cover is a little bit hard to lift up.4. Wifi is rather slow: it took ages to download a 20MB Chrome update. While all the rest of my wifi-enabled devices can do much better than that at the same position.5. Awkward placement of the power button: near the very top on the right-hand side above the volume rocker. Certainly takes time to get used to.Conclusion:I thought as a very light user it may be possible to get away with its poor chipset, but I was wrong. Too bad I have to return it, it is an absolute beauty. If Sony puts Xperia P level hardware in the J I would even be willing to pay $300 for such a phone.5 stars for the design; 2 stars off for the disappointing hardware performance.Note: I'm a user who uses the phone primarily for occasional IM chatting and web browsing during free times(about two hours a day altogether). The qualities I value the most are good battery performance, fluid UI, and fast internet browsing. To conserve battery and ensure a good performance I removed all the home panel widgets except for the connectivity control, the clock, and 3 or 4 shortcuts for apps.", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Great Find.", "Author": "Zachery McClean", "ReviewID": "R2JTL7YGYZOJ1L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Certainly not the best phone around, but definitely great considering the price range.

So first thing I noticed was how easy it was to setup, although I didn't get any headphones with, thanks Amazon, it was packaged well enough and the basics setup was a breeze. Depending on where you are and what service you use, some of the more detailed settings could be a bit tedious where you need to manually enter settings, such as access point info, etc.The display is large and crisp, and very responsive and the wi-fi works pretty well. Transfer speeds were pretty good. I upgraded the phone to 4.1.2 Jellybean through my wi-fi, the install files downloaded in almost 3 minutes (128mb file). I had to wait a while for the OS to install, but it was smooth, and works great.The camera could have been better, but has simple to use features and the exposure can be adjusted to compensate for low light levels. Internal memory will fill up pretty fast when installing apps, and I would suggest the use of apps such as Easy Uninstaller, app2SD and Advanced Task Manager to help move, stop or uninstall files easily. Sound quality from the phone speakers are decent, but sucks through most of the headphones I tried and some video files even when converted by the software provided didn't play, I had to use QQ player to play them. The radio doesn't work very well where I am (Trinidad).The phone is very customizable if you know your way around a Sony xperia and it does perform tasks well. Calls work fine, sound quality on calls are excellent. For the price, I think it's worth a look as a budget Xperia phone.An update, it just suddenly started rebooting as it starts up, and won't stop no matter what I try.

I've downloaded a few fairly higher-end graphically intensive games on it and they play just fine. Occasionally, I do notice a very slight lag in its overall functionality but once again, very little and only momentarily. For the price this phone is decently powerful.The screen size, brightness, and color are outstanding and with the upgrade to Android 4.1.2, it's pretty up-to-date. And the actual look of the phone is really slick.  The only thing that I would wish for in this phone is that it had more internal storage as it only has 4GB, with a little more than 2GB usable but, that in and of itself is not too bad.
