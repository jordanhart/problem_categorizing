NOT English", "Author": "Kristen B.", "ReviewID": "R19US15OVHG7RT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is probably the cheapest phone I have ever seen. It is made out of thin plastic and would probably shatter into a million pieces if ever dropped. Secondly, this was not a phone intended for American use. The factory \"preset\" is to Chinese - so good luck finding someone to decipher the symbols in getting the phone to display English words. The earbuds that it came with are just as cheesy and hurt your ears. I would suggest spending a little more and steering clear away from this mess.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D89I8ZE"}}
