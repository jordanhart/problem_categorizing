Amazon & Emole failed to deliver it and they can't track it and why it takes over amonth for a delivery date I will never know. You find this out after they take your money!Anyway, they can't find it and when I complained they frantically made excuses on USPS.Now they don't reply because they know they screwed up so I am requesting a refund. Puttung there head in the sand hoping this goes away will not help. I want a full refund and let others know not to by from Amazon or Emole for electronics. Not only did they waste over a month of my time but I have to go through the hassle of getting my money back and luckily I bought a temporary Walmart phone for $20 to get me by.I suggest everyone should buy at their local store and not amazon. Online purchasing dosen't care and you do not have the option of talking with someone but just e-mailing in which they can just ignore you!Sincerely,  Ripped Off!", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worst Customer Service, missing items & phone looks used", "Author": "WomeMD", "ReviewID": "R24NFNBQIWCXHO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As soon as I got the phone, I noticed three items (USB cable, headset & microSD card) were missing. I tried to reach the vendor, called more than three times, wrote more than three emails. Never got any reply. Not only items were missing, but the phone itself feels a used phone with the outside cover replaced. My advice: DO NOT BUY any thing from the OEM shop!!!", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003WSL2RM"}}
