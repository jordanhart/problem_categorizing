Gomez Jimenez \"backros\"", "ReviewID": "R3B7WZCDTKPJPU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this one 6 months ago, and can't be more pleased with it. A month ago I received the update to Android 2.1 and Sony announce the update to 2.3 at 2 quarter of 2011. The apps on android market are the best. This version is E10i, so you have to be sure that supports 3G in your zone:E10a has 800/850/1900/2100 WCDMA and quad band GSM/EDGEE10i has 900/1700/2100 WCDMA and quad band GSM/EDGE", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Phone died when left off charge and could not contact seller", "Author": "Gou Rao", "ReviewID": "RPKQ3T3K0GQ4Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The product itself was OK... the phone died, this happens to electronics, but I could not contact BLUTEKUSA who sold me the phone.  After a while of trying, the warranty expired anyway.  When I bought the phone, they sent a thank you email, and the contact address they had in that email would not work.I tried to contact them because I left the phone uncharged for a week, and when I came back to use it, it simply would not turn on.  I tried everything, plugging it into the wall, trying the sony s/w ... the phone is simply dead.Buy from a carrier and pay the extra money if you want the service you deserve.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "CELL PHONE SONY ERICSSON E10i", "Author": "JOHNNY", "ReviewID": "RPRFZULL4WK7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "El tel\u00e9fono es pr\u00e1ctico para ser usado con una sola mano, es pantalla t\u00e1ctil, colores n\u00edtidos, buen sonido, tiene wifi, puede trabajar con las tres operadoras del Ecuador.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Old and small, but very good", "Author": "A Customer \"customer12345657\"", "ReviewID": "RWCL8YR5PDQ8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has an old version of android, and the screen is small, so you don't get as many home screen options (one widget per page, and 4 static shortcuts).BUT...1. Thanks to the small screen and slower processor, the battery lasts about twice as long as newer phones.  This is a good option if you want a longer-lasting battery as a tiny vacation phone, but don't want to give up some of your critical Android apps.2. The camera is much better than most phones.  Sony phones have always had superior cameras.  Much better auto focus, and less noise in the image.  It also has the ability to take clear macro pictures at only a couple inches, which most phones are not good at.  Shutter response is pretty good, and it has an actual 2-stage camera button.  Many phones have no camera button at all (requiring use of an on-screen button, which is clumsy), and far fewer have a pre-focus option.3. Good sound quality through the headphone jack.  This is another area where many \"good\" phones are happy to do poorly, but once again Sony is music-focused.4. Better sound quality through the ringer and earpiece than most low-cost phones.Note: If this phone only works on your carrier's EDGE network (non-3g), use Opera Mini as your browser and set the image quality to low.  Opera compresses websites, and this display has no use for medium/high images anyway.  With this setup, I didn't even notice the EDGE data speed during normal browsing.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great, on time", "Author": "Travelbyballoon", "ReviewID": "R1NA3992VFOI4X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone came on time, if not a little earlier than I expected and though smaller than I thought it would be, I love it.
