THAT IS NOT WHAT I GOT. I got a complicated PEICE of plastic. It does not come with a stop watch!! It took me five hours to get the actual device into the watch strap. You can't charge it while it is in watch form. The only. Way to get it out of watch form is using a clip. Very time I took the watch out of it to charge it got scraped by the clip. It disconnects every five minutes. When I finally got used to the watch it fell apart. DO NOT BUY THIS PEICE OF GARBAGE.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great and feedback", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Fabio Kindle\"", "ReviewID": "R1XD8F5CHRZQVF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works great.
