{"Reviews": [{"Title": "All About Perspective...", "Author": "piousheathen", "ReviewID": "R2OVZ12JYG74YM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I will state that I am using this model cellphone to write this review. I have had this phone for one year, one month, twelve days, seven hours and fourteen minutes as of this writing. It has good battery-life; I have turned it off about a dozen times, maybe. I charge it regularly. It has never died, though it is time to replace it, as the charger no longer stays securely in place. This phone has taken a severe beating from me, and earned my respect thereby. It has hit the concrete a thousand times. I once dropped it in the sink, partially submerging it. I used a hair-blowdryer on it, then left it in my oven overnight to dry, and months later it's like it never happened. So it isn't super-delicate and will survive some abuse, I can swear to that. It has served as my daily internet connection (for news, shopping, Wikipedia, YouTubing, Amazon, reporting earthquakes to the USGS - everything the casual internetter does - all on an \"unlimited\" data plan, of course, and I am not here to review AT&T;'s service); it is my sole telephone connection, and likewise my means of texting and such; and my only camera, being myself not so much interested in capturing and sharing all of life's precious moments - though I do send a handful of pictures and videos, and so for me personally, the camera modes are \"better\" (more bells and whistles) than I need (though far less than others, I would also surmise); but there's nothing wrong with the quality, for the forty bucks they're asking right now. The most relevant thing I can say about this phone is this no-brainer: probably what will most strongly influence your opinion of it is what kind of phone you are coming off of, and how many functions you are used to having at your everyday disposal. If you only need a few things, this has them all and you can make a button on the screen for \"shortcuts\" like alarm clock, calculator, and anything else you want designated. If you are used to a quality smartphone in the $150-250-and-up range and you want a cheap backup, this one may be too mediocre for you, but it may be passable, if you are able and willing to sacrifice.. If you are accustomed to state-of-the-art technology, this phone is probably going to seem as a Stone Age relic to you, and will not do what you are used to doing. (I understand some cellphones cost upwards of $600; if you have one of those, this phone would be an insult to taste and an affront to your dignity.) If it is only a short-term backup, then it will perform all the usual phone, text, picture/video, and internet functions you'll absolutely *need*, unless your job demands more-than-basic internet capabilities. Those spoiled on quality had best look elsewhere.If, on the other hand, you have never had a smartphone, or have only recently realized that (as was the case for me) you are paying enough of a cellphone bill each month that you could be receiving internet as well, this kind of device is a heck of an eye-opener. It will do way more than you'll ever even find out about, it's easy to figure out how to use and find your way around on, and it's kind of fun just checking out all of its features. I never once opened the user's guide that came with it.There are better and worse phones, no doubts about that; I always thought simplest was best, but upgrading to this phone was, for me, a leap forward. I would probably not buy this if I was used to a real smartphone; however, this phone is a cool upgrade if you've stayed away from the technology so far, partly because of its ease of use. After the abuse heaped on the one I have now, it is time for me to buy a new cellphone. I'm going to order another one of these.*Update 1/14/2013*Still running strong; a couple of friends and family now own one of these, and we're just happy as clams. (Clams are, by nature, extremely happy creatures - or so I'm told.)Apparently, this model is considered dated enough that AT&T; still offers \"unlimited\" data packages with no throttling (as far as I can tell); phones that transfer data at higher speeds are not eligible for the same plan, but I still get unlimited talk/text/internet for $50 a month, and if this phone is slow, I haven't noticed. I hope they never stop selling them; I just bought an extra in case some evil should befall this one. I stand by my earlier review: this dandy device services my communications-needs admirably, though a real computer will still be necessary for any serious projects.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent Phone", "Author": "J. Self", "ReviewID": "R35FVRUNBFG6HV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So, I got this phone to use with a plan we already have. It's pretty good for texting (threaded texts), taking a reasonable picture, or using instant messenger.A few things I don't like about it:There's no subject line for if you want to add a caption to a picture you are sending to facebook via mms.The middle button, when pressed at the home menu, will bring up the internet. (Creates bad accidents if you don't have a good data plan)If the directional button is pushed to the left, email pops up. (Another thing to remember to avoid)Menus are cumbersome if you don't set shortcuts.I've had some issues where my keyboard input is lysdexic and places letters in the wrong order from what I typed.Adding a ringtone is difficult for this phone, unless maybe you buy one through at&t.; I haven't used the feature to find out, sorry.Conclusion: All in all, I think it's a very useful phone. It's definitely not as capable as a smartphone, but there are enough features to keep you entertained without using data. Oh, speaking of entertainment only trial/demo games came on mine.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mixed Bag", "Author": "Karl Brody \"Me\"", "ReviewID": "R1EMBMI77A90PZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace my old Razr that was still working fine. I wanted something that i could text faster on and would have more memory for pics and music. I always liked the looks of the Blackberry but didnt want to spend a small fortune on a phone that doesnt get used alot. I saw an ad in the newspaper from Target Stores. They had this phone on sale for 40 bucks. I had never heard of Pantech and was not sure what i would be getting my self into. I bought the phone and set it up for Go Phone. I have had the phone for about 6 months and so far it works fine. I am still trying to get used to it since i used my Razr for many years. Things i dont like: The screen shuts off too soon. It doesnt have a conventional 1/8\" plug for headphones. You need an adapter. Voicemail wont give you a name or number so as to know who called. You have to call it to find out who called and get charged. No option to delete voicemails that you dont want to check. Text messages get grouped together which can cause you to miss one. When i tun on the phone it tells me i have new messages. But they are old messages that i have already looked at. The camera works fine. The speaker works fine. The keyboard is easy to use for its size. It has a nice checkered rubber back. The sim card and battery are easy to get to. It has an expandable memory slot. The battery has a decent life. I have dropped it twice without a sign of dropping it. You are lucky if you can get everything you want in one package. Its a mixed bag. We will see if it lasts as long as my original Razr that still works.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good value in a basic phone", "Author": "CharlesT", "ReviewID": "RAANA209J3GQP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to get just a basic talk/text phone and not spend a ton of money, or renew my contract with the carrier.

My biggest complaint is that the charger stopped working after a year.  I've never had this happen with any other phone.  I thought it was the battery, but when I took it to the store, they plugged it in to a different charger and it was fine.  The PROBLEM is that no one sells the charger locally.  I went to Target, Best Buy, Radio Shack and the ATT store.  They all said this particular charger is difficult to find.  Since this came at a very bad time when my cell phone was crucial, (doesn't it always?) I almost was forced to buy a new phone.  Maybe this is Pantech's plan.  Finally found what I hope to be the correct charger on Amazon, but it is not elgible for prime, and I'll have to wait about a week for it to arrive.

I got it from Amazon's Warehouse Deals, described as \"Used, Like New\". The box was beat up, but unopened, and the phone, battery, and charger were still sealed in their bags. Very happy about that. I looked around online and found the AT&T;/OEM car charger, data cables, rubber cases, screen protectors, and a memory card for a few bucks apiece, and downloaded the factory documentation and gave that a quick scan. I have somewhere around $60 invested in everything, which I think is very good compared to retail pricing in-store ($70 locally for just the phone, tax inc).Yes, the phone will apparently get flaky if you text a lot and save the texts to the phone's memory. *edit* I had thought it saved texts to the SD card, but it saves them only to the phone memory, then additional messages are saved to the SIM. A week later, and it's telling me it's out of room. Lame.The keypad is tiny (I can cover 16 keys with the tip of my thumb), but it is still fairly easy to use, and the tactile feedback is good. While I don't find it difficult to use normally, it will absolutely prevent me from texting in the car, which is a good thing.Someone had posted that they are always hitting the volume key in their pocket, making the phone ring incessantly. I put the soft case on it, and turned on the auto keypad lock, both of which prevent inadvertent use. I have had this in my pocket almost constantly without any problems at all.Call quality seems to be pretty good, although I would like the call volume to go a bit higher. If I'm in the middle of something, or in a loud area, I just connect my Bluetooth headset, which is much louder than the phone's earpiece. Not ideal, but easy enough.The pictures seem okay; better than I expected from a 1.3MP camera, anyway. If I wanted better picture quality, I'd use a camera, or would have bought a better phone. For the things I will use the camera for, it works fine.There are a few minor quirks that I find annoying. Ringtone size is limited to 300KB. I have not been able to assign different tones for calls and texts, which I find strange. The menu layout and shortcuts can mostly be easily changed to be a little easier to navigate (compared to my previous phones, anyway), and most settings are simple and obvious. Some of the shortcuts and such, I wish could be removed entirely, but since this was intended to be a prepaid phone, I understand why they are locked in. I have not yet figured out how to save pictures sent in multimedia messages to a separate folder on the card, and haven't yet figured out how to enlarge them within the message. This is kind of annoying, but not a deal-breaker. My old flipphone would allow both of those steps, and I had assumed it was a fairly standard thing.There are a few things that I absolutely hate about this device; the pre-programmed keys (left, right, and center on the thumbpad) to pull up AT&T;'s awful browser, email, and chat cannot, as far as I can tell, be reprogrammed or deleted. Since you use the pad for most things, I find it easy to start one while trying to do something else on the phone. This will probably diminish as I get used to the phone, but right now, I hate these \"features\".I run Win 7 64 bit on my desktop, and Pantech's USB drivers included in their PC Suite software don't seem to be compatible with this OS, and don't appear to work on my older XP system either. I searched online for, found, and tried, several solutions, none of which have worked so far. So, in order to transfer files from the phone to the PC, or vice versa, I have to remove the microSD card, put it in the USB shuttle I have, and then perform whatever step that way. Hopefully I can find a work-around for this, but at the moment, all I can do is charge the phone via USB, and get annoyed when PC Suite crashes. I would like to figure out how to have Windows treat the phone as a simple flashdrive (as it did with all of my other phones), but have had no luck so far. I find this fairly annoying.So, yeah, for what I paid, it's a good phone, IMO. If the driver issue were resolved, and the pre-programmed keys could be changed, I'd be thrilled. As it stands, I'm satisfied with this purchase. If I had paid retail... honestly, I probably wouldn't be as happy, but at half price, from Amazon and not a third party, I think it's a good buy. My expectations are probably too high for phones in this price/feature range, but I think it's probably deserving of a 4 star rating.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unlocked does not mean all features are unlocked", "Author": "TD", "ReviewID": "R1OOIZWS7638KZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was disappointed in that I assumed and description read, phone unlocked.

This phone seemed good. Just like the blackberry, and for a decent price. If some one is looking for just a bare bones call some one and text a few times a week, this is more than enough for you. If you plan on using your phone a lot, however, you will run into some major problems.First the good: The phone is light and small. The keys took some getting used to, but they work really well and are responsive enough for you to know when you press one. There are some other good features, like being able to browse the web while in a call, and the camera, for this phone, isn't bad.now for the bad: This phone is bad at texting. Why? Because if you set it to auto delete texts, it will lock up when your texts get full. Yes, lock up. I have had to remove by battery from this thing to cold restart it almost 4 or 5 times a week just because of this. And if you don't know that you are full, you cannot get new texts until you delete the old ones. This along with the fact that you can't look at your texts while in a call makes this phone a bad choice for me. If I can browse the Internet and SEND texts, why can't I open my messages while in a call? I can if some one sends one and it pops up, but if not, I'm out of luck.The next really bad thing about this phone is that it is too thin. Yes, too thin. Why might this be a problem? I have gone through 3 sim cards in 6 months of having this phone, 2 within the first 2 month. The ware on the sim cards is really noticeable, and routinely I have a \"Insert Sim\" error on my phone. This can happen mid call, making it a hassle, taking your battery out, removing your sim card, putting everything back, turning the phone back on, and hoping that it works.I'm in the market for a new phone. After 6 months, the texting started to crap out, and I can no longer view sent texts. I am looking to get an Android phone or something of the sort.

I downloaded the pantech PC Suite and tried to browse internet from my phone on my laptop,using both the usb cable and bluetooth, but it has thrown error saying modem not supported. I dont know what is this error.. I tried by all ways still same problem.2. I bought the earphones mentioned in the amazon for this Pantech Link 7040, unfortunately the earbuds are big and not at all comfortable and they always falldown. More over the sound quality is very low and poor.3. One more drawback is that the AT&T; videos and radio never worked on my phone, even though I am under at&t; $50 unlimited monthly plan.4. And the phone claims to run videos under mp4, wmv formats, they never played from my pantech link..God only knows why they dont play.5. Internet provided by 3G is very slow and I can compare it with 2G speed. pathetic.6. The power cable provided by Amazon is used one and almost broken..still I am living with it.7. It does not have even radio which is a basic feature in any small phone.8. Dont know if I am too sensitive, I am getting headache when I use this phone for more than 5 min..Positive points:1. Call recording option is there2. supports 32 GB memory card to store lot of stuff handy..3. We can buy USB cable to directly access data from phone. and can use the same for charging.4.

Then I got an iPad w a data plan through my employer and realized that I was wasting $30 a month on data for a smart phone. I was looking for a good phone for basic functions and no data plan. And the bar was set high coming off the Android-powered HTC Inspire. Let me tell you- the Pantech Link is awesome!Let's get the negative out of the way first: it's not a smart phone, and it's not supposed to be. The camera is kind of weak, but that's to be expected (and it actually works fine for MMS messages and snapshots). Sme of the keys, also, are not customizable.So that's the bad news. The GREAT news is that this little phone is surprisingly amazing! It's thin, and I mean thin! Like, forget-it's-in-your-shirt-pocket thin. It feels solid, much better than you'd expect from a $30 phone. The screen is bright and vibrant and the keyboard is easy to use.

I was able to stick in my SIM and get it working right off the bat!What I like:-Clear voice quality, and ring is loud. Vibrate on the phone is very strong, too. On most devices I can't feel it at all when it's in my pocket -- not so for the Pantech Link.-Conversation-style messaging interface -- very convenient.-Keyboard keys protrude and are rounded, having a lot of depth. Keyboard is very small so this makes it easy to type.-Display is bright and clear, even in direct sunlight.-Very light and thin! My previous phone felt like a brick compared to this thing, but I can barely feel this thing in my pocket.What I don't like:-Sending texts is somewhat slow, and there is often a delay of 5-15 seconds before the text would send successfully. I also have a lot of trouble with texts not sending successfully, getting sent straight to the Outbox to be resent. Resetting the phone usually fixes the problem. I fear this may be a Ptel issue, but I'm not sure.-I can't send or retrieve MMS messages. It turns out the default MMS coding is for AT&T;, and I worked with Ptel representatives on multiple occasions to get this issue resolved to no avail. If you're getting this phone for AT&T;, you're probably fine. For anything else, though, you'd better look elsewhere. UPDATE: Finally got it working fantastically after another chat with Ptel.-Confusing interface. I had to dig through the menus to find how to change ringtone, find the calculator, etc. Pretty much I set everything I'd ever use into the Shortcuts menu.-Right side of the phone felt... arthritic. The buttons there would creak uncomfortably. Not sure if this is due to my phone being a refurb, though.Overall, I like the phone. It's very light and inexpensive.

Call quality is rather good.2.) QWERTY keyboard.3.) The phone can handle a 16GB card, which is 4X what prepaid phones in this price range are usually built to handle.CONS:1.) I NEVER would have bought this phone if I had known that finding headphones for it would be EXTREMELY difficult (I still haven't managed to do it), if not impossible, to obtain. The headphone jack is entirely proprietary and nothing like it is sold in any store near me. Whatever the super-secret handshake and code necessary to get headphones so that I can listen to MP3s, I'm certainly not privy to either.2.) The battery life is below average for this type of phone. I have to charge mine every other day at a minimum.3.) The QWERTY buttons are stiff and shaped as if the manufacturer wanted to cause you pain. After a few messages texting becomes rather uncomfortable.4.) The menus are as counter-instinctual as can be. Finding certain functions, such as your call log (one of many examples) is like being on a scavenger hunt - so if by chance you luck out and find what you're looking for, by all means remember how you did it.5.) Storage space for texts is low. If you consistently text with more than one or two people, you'll have to delete entire threads just to make room for incoming or outgoing messages.6.) Low camera quality for a phone this size.7.) The screen goes dark way too quickly. You'll spend almost as much time unlocking the screen saver as you will texting on it.SUMMARY:If good call quality is enough for you, then the phone is barely worth the price. In every other aspect of why I wanted this phone, it failed to meet my expectations in the most overwhelming way possible. I give it two stars because the call quality really is rather good, but only two stars because I hate EVERYTHING else about this phone. It's so bad that I actually took out my SIM and put it back into my Samsung A107, which is currently the cheapest, most no-frills phone on the market (should you be interested, I have reviewed that phone as well). True, the A107 doesn't allow me to listen to songs, but it's not as if I can with the Pantech either. Further, the A107's predictive texting on non-punitive buttons is so much faster and more comfortable than the Pantech's tiny and stiff speed bump buttons that even if someone finds me a set of headphones for the Pantech I probably wouldn't give it another try anyway. I truly hate the Pantech P7040, so much so that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone - you can get comparable call quality for half the price almost anywhere else.Save your money for something good, rather than having a $50 phone collect dust because it annoys you so much more than a $9.99 phone with no games, songs or camera. The only thing that's kept me from giving it away for free is that every AT&T; customer I know already has a better phone. I can't stress enough how much I hate this phone and how fervently you should avoid it.", "Date": "October 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "loved it", "Author": "Jaheda Hanif", "ReviewID": "R3DMZZAGTKU4ZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "last time i had purchased a phone thru amazon i didnt really like it .. the charger was really bad the phone itself died after like a couple of months of use but surprisingly this phone so far has been great! the phone itself is in good condition charger works! i really like it .. thanks =]", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's an OK Phone.", "Author": "Leland G.

I was not able to place my contacts in alphabetical order as requested, even though, the phone had that function, it did not work. I even went to a Radio Shack and they were unable to do anything to help me set up my new Pantech. I believe this will be a good phone for \"TO GO\" people, that need a phone simple to make and receive calls, nothing else, not even pictures, were good quality. a bit disappointed with the product.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone if it works--mine didn't", "Author": "AL", "ReviewID": "R2QNTNA92XZ0CX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: Call quality good, thin, buttons good, although a little small for big hands, low price.Cons: Texting doesn't always work (at all), one-button shortcuts limited.Phone had better voice quality than my old Samsung, but texting never worked.

Kitchens \"deliberatespurothemoment\"", "ReviewID": "RSW7V8VZ8UND8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Obtained this phone as a stop gap phone until a more capable Smartphone arrived. At first glance the phone gives a definite nod to the layout and style of Blackberry phones. The device fits perfect in my pocket but the screen could have benefited from a protector as I soon accumulated some minute scratches on the screen. The face of the phone sports a chrome accent going around the edges. The SIM card slot is located underneath the battery or rather to the side but requires removal of the battery. Popping your AT&T; SIM into the marked slot feels a bit odd since there was little to no resistance. The back cover snaps back into place, the rubberized textured backing is pleasing.A circular wheel provides most of the menu navigation but like most of these phone it will use the two select buttons at \"decision point\" moments. Other external features like the keyboard are fun type though I often had to rekey words with repeat characters (like \"door\") since the default input schema will cycle through an alternate keyboard when you type the same letter twice (so door become \"d\" UMLAUT \"r\" for instance). I also found that I had to hold the shift or FN function key at the same time to access the upper case or orange screen printed alternate keys and so instead of one hand typing I had to interrupt the flow to make sure the right key combination was pressed. In password parts of the web-browser a letter shows briefly before becoming an asterisk but when Shift-Key entries are inputted they become asterisks without displaying. I could be missing something here but I found that part particularly annoying.The built-in software on the phone is meant to monetize every aspect of what is a normal feature of most smartphones: listen to music on the internet? Monthly charge. Use GPS and maps to find a street? Monthly charge. Play games? You guessed it, a monthly charge option (uh?) next to the buy game option at the ATT Store on the phone. The free apps are few and far between - a Facebook Twitter was already loaded on the phone. Trial versions of games are available.The web browser is workable and defaults to AT&T; branded page with customizable page elements, a feature of ATT.NET that I couldn't get working. Accessing advanced features or settings is a bit awkward. I went to opera.com which detected correctly my Pantech P7040p phone and suggested the compatible version of Opera's web browser. I soon loaded the Opera mini 4.4 browser after acknowledging several security prompts. Once loaded Opera apparently will keep triggering a \"feature\" of this phone: network access by the Opera applet must be specifically allowed each time. So a better browser but with incessant prompts the equivalent of \"Press OK to continue\".The mail features of the phone include built in understanding of several webmail providers (AOL, Windows Live Hotmail, Yahoo for instance). I suppose I should not have been surprised at the lack of Exchange or corporate email connectivity. That would have required a remote wipe security ability that this consumer only device was unlikely to implement. Still would have been nice. Outlook Web Access is the only way for right now.Overall a capable if limited phone that is fun to use!", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pantech Phone Review", "Author": "Tess2011", "ReviewID": "R2T9J9S5AIV131", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone works great!
