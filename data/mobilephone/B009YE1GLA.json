The picture and video quality are just ok, but buying a cheap unlocked phone my son can't lose has been priceless.  It's waterproof as well and came with an extra battery.  He gets so many compliments on it.  It makes him so proud.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good watch phone!!!", "Author": "Sensei", "ReviewID": "R7HOMCKTIG3R0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The watch phone is good!  Eliminates the inconvenience of having to carry around more than one phone, at least for me.  This was one of the reasons why I bought it.  Voice calls are clear.  It comes with an earphone.  After sometime it no longer worked.  With voice calls that take long I find my hand hurting!  One other advantage: it is water proof. I do not have to remove it before washing my hands.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "fun to have", "Author": "luis madera", "ReviewID": "R2XLGK3T5JA8IB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "its a great phone watch, still working on some settings but i'll get there,i recommend it you'll enjoy it bye,", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$225.55", "Features": "Voice recorder / E-book reader / PC camera / WAP / MMS / FM Radio\nConvenient and useful touch screen\nMulti-function watch\nWork on GSM network frequencies 850/900/1800/1900 MHz.", "Name": "Popular MQ998 Cell Phone Watch Mobile With Video recorder camera function,Sports Style - 1.5 Inch Watch Cell Phone Watch (FM, MP3 MP4 Player, Waterproof)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Lx30P9ouL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009YE1GLA"}}
