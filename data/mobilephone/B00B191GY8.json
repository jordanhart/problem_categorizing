Sound Quality is good. Desktop response is good and fluid, comes with Two Batteries and Two Back Covers, one with a Flap Front Cover Attachment. Really nice. The device looks great in Hand. Looks like the Galaxy Note II(Knockoff) But Very Nicely Done. Great response from the Soft Keys next to the Physical Home Button on the Device. Camera Front/Back Take Nice Pics however not high quality. But pics would hold up as nice or decent.Con's - My Biggest issue was the Device l noted this in the description \"3G/4G - 850/2100 bands. Fully compatible with at&t;, straight Talk & Net10 at 2G/3G/4G. Compatible with T-Mobile & Simple Mobile at 2G. For Straight Talk, Trac fone, Simple Mobile or Net 10 will requires a manual APN setup.\"However its not 4G Compatible on TMobile Network, took a few days to configure as the Software kept crashing and stating the option was not available try again later. Took an additional Day to configure Texting to Send. You have to lock the screen if you are making a call and holding the phone to your head as the touch screen interferes with the functionality of the call, often dropping the speaker so you can't hear. The Battery Takes a considerable amount of time to charge, and of course drains moderately fast with normal daily use.I also found the Home/Menu Button is non responsive at times. Having to receive more then a few pushes. The Cameras need Ample Light to be used. Does not work well at all in Low Light even with a light shining directly on you. The light has to be Ambient or Room Lit, So no Web Chatting in Bed.Phone Cover gets in the way of Car Phone Holder, I just leave it open so I can see the screen.All in All. A very good device for the money spent. I will do some research on the 4.1.1 software issues and Rooting as the device is not rooted. Hopefully that will correct some of the quirkiness.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as advertised, but a good product for the buck. Doesn't work on the 3G Straight talk network, let alone on the 4G.", "Author": "Victor H. Martinez \"VHM Digital\"", "ReviewID": "R26UWQC8I62FXJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone in the hopes of getting 3G service from Straight Talk AT&T; network. The problem is that AT&T; 3G is on the 850- 1900 MHZ frequencies, while this phone only picks up the 850, 2100 MHZ. I have a Straight Talk AT&T; compatible sim card and it only works on the 2G network (EDGE) with this phone. Also tried the T-Mobile sim card and same thing, since the 3G frequencies on this network are 1700, 2100. You get the 2G (EDGE) as well. If you want the 4G, don't even think about it; it doesn't work at all. I tried so many things trying to make it work with no luck and as a confirmed customer I advise you to look else where if you are looking for 3G or 4G here, in the US. If you are just looking for a nice, cheap and fast phone this one is a great one. This phone is fast and very responsive, awesome looking and great memory. Too bad about the frequencies it handles. Get it if you only want good quality calls, texting and 2G speeds here, in the US. It may work on 3G and 4G other countries. Again, remember: IT DOES NOT WORK ON THE 3G NOR ON THE 4G HERE, IN THE US.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice and responsive... Wins \"Initial Quality\" award, but that's all.", "Author": "J Ponder", "ReviewID": "R2HM3M9XL8N1TQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone turned out to be a very nice and responsive phone.  It has a beautiful display.  I actually like this phone, but it will not meet my needs.  I purchased mainly to use mobile web on Straight Talk byob with AT&T; network.  Unfortunately, I can only get around 114-145 Kbps over mobile data.  Further troubleshooting showed that the phone is only 3G capable on CDMA technology band, not the GSM band...  Well that's just crappy since most networks that allow sim card swapping operate on GSM...Update 3/25/2013:It's been not quite a week and I feel I need to update some info.  The phone operates on GSM and WCDMA (previously stated CDMA) bands.  Upon further discussion, research, and troubleshooting, it appears that the phone may have the ability to reach 3G/4G speeds.  I do show a \"H\" above the signal bar most of the time.  Occasionally I see an \"E\" and I think I saw a \"G\" just briefly, once.  Seemingly, the \"H\" represents the HSPA/HSPA+ bands.  Even with the \"H\" I was still only reaching 110-500Kbps down when in or near my home.  However, the up was 300-700 Kbps.  Really strange that the upstream has been consistantly higher than the downstream.I decided to venture away from my neighborhood and test the speeds further.  About 8 miles away, at my church, I was able to reach between 700Kbps and 1.2 Mbps downstream, and 600-980 Kbps upstream.  Even driving around I can get up to 1.2 Mbps.  I'll try a few more areas of the city.  I hope to start seeing downstreams at 2.5Mbps or better.  At this time, I can't say whether the speed issue is with the phone or the AT&T; network in my area.UPDATED 3/26/2013:Because my download speed was typically around 120-240 Kbps with occasional spikes up to about 800Kbps, I decided to try another test.  I did see speeds peak at 1.2 Mbps at one point, but the average for the test would still end up around 400 Kbps.  I actually only saw that type of peak on that one night around 10:30PM EDT.  My upload speeds are 3-4 times higher than my downstream speeds.  Since this was using ATT network via StraightTalk, I decided I would try the phone actually on ATT network with ATT sim card.1.  Contacted ATT and asked them to simply add the 4G data plan to my account that I was only using for calls.  They asked for the IMEI number to determine what plan the phone could handle.  Once I provided this, they could only add the 3G data plan as the IMEI was not recognized as 4G.  We tried both IMEI numbers.  Once this was in place, I began testing again using the APN that was defaulted from the sim.  I was still only getting downstreams of approx 125Kbps.2.  I decided to get ATT support on the line.  Because the phone could not qualify for the 4G plan, the gentlemen I was working with used a dummy IMEI for a Samsumg Note 2.  Once he did this, he was able to add the 4G data plan.  Still, the downloads were approx 125-240 Kbps.  He then walked me through add APNs that were specific to 3G and 4G services.  We used three different APN settings that ATT typically use.  At no point could I get over 240 Kbps on avg downstream.  However, I saw huge increases in upstream data to the range of 700 Kbps- 1.1 Mbps between the different APNs.  Finally, the guy said he could not help me any further.  He also mentioned that seeing the \"H\" next to the signal bars only represented 3G service.  He says 4G would show \"4\" or \"4G\" next to the bars.  I have never seen either of those show up for 4G.After fighting with this phone and settings, I finally got just over 5 Mbps just as I was ready to give up.  I tested while at my son's doctor office.  I drove around testing and began getting 2.5-5.5 Mbps.  This was using the ATT sim.  I did not have the Straight talk sim with me.  Upon nearing my home, the signal disappeared and I began getting the slow speeds again.  Looks like the network in areas I frequent aren't very good.  I will test the ST sim in other areas again.  I guess I came away knowing the phone has the ability to reach speeds of 4-5 Mbps.  With that said, this phone is a winner for me.Updated 3/28/2013:Drove to the areas where I was getting really good speeds with the AT&T; sim and tested the straight talk sim.  Still getting decent speeds, but the Straight Talk speed are less than those with AT&T.;  In some cases nearly 2.5 Mbps less.  It appears that the speeds are throttled from the typical AT&T; service speeds.  Still not bad speeds for the price.  I was reaching 1.5-3.5 with the Straight Talk sim.  I think it is still worth it for $45 monthly.Updated 7/29/2013:So after about 4 months, this phone has been retired.  Although the initial quality seemed very nice, in the not-so-long run, it's now known that all the phone offered was initial quality.  The screen started getting it's first dead pixels (or dark spots) about 2 -3 weeks in.  I ignored the first, but then several others followed after about 4-6 weeks.  Call quality got really bad.  The signal would go in and out all the time and conversations got very choppy.  The screen would not remain off when holding the phone to ear.  So quite often I would dial numbers and place the calls on hold with my ear.  When using the speaker, often the phone would revert back to the ear piece in the mist of conversation.  This would happen frequently while the phone sat on my desk during conference calls.  So there was no accidental pressing of the screen.  Plus the screen would be off during the change.As an Android device used for emails, web surfing, and other non-phone related items, it is okay.  It met my needs, except for the pixel loss.  As for a phone, I often found myself pulling the sim and placing it in a standard, old school, flip phone when needing to just make calls.  Now the sim has found a, permanent, new home.  I've never retired a phone so quickly.I always see the automobile commercials on televisions stating how certain vehicles received the JD Powers award for \"Initial Quality\" and wondered how they fared after a couple years when the 'initial' new feel wore off...  Well, if they are anything like this phone, we should all stay away from those cars too...  lol", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible Phone", "Author": "Rachael S.", "ReviewID": "R1PD1LX9UV8OQ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recieved this phone after about 2 weeks I bought an T-Mobile sim card that works on straight talk, I called Straight talk to activate it and they would not activate it for me becuase I needed an at@t Sim card that works on Straight talk, so i did that and called back they once again told me they could not activate it for me.

Was able to set up the WLAN quickly and so far it is very fast. I'm using it with the ATT Net10 plan and the SIM card installed flawlessly with the instructions provided by the vendor. One Walmart I called said they wanted $67.00 for the 3 sim card pack. I bought the same pack on sale at Radio Shack for $10. Phone vendor corresponded promptly regarding a couple of questions. Evidently APNs change occasionally because those given by the vendor and older ones on the internet were not helpful.  I found the correct APN settings on the Net10 site and the data kicked in almost immediately. I turn off the data connection whenever I'm in range of wireless. App has a setting that gives a warning and then the shut-off for data. You can adjust those to whatever levels you want. Net10s data is not unlimited, but I think it will be enough based on past analysis of my former Verizon account. At this point I haven't had need for a second SIM, but wanted the flexibility of using that. Good screen, comes with all the advertised items including an extra battery and screen protector is already installed. The camera isn't great, but I don't think most phone cameras are even if they are high pixel count. As a DSLR user I don't depend on it except in unexpected situations. The biggest benefit is a good phone going from my $85 monthly Verizon plan to a $45 Net10 plan ($50 initially and $45 thereafter with on-line registration and auto re-fills). I like the larger screen size but didn't want to go all the way to 5\". The google browser has quite a few Chinese(?) characters, but I downloaded the Firefox for Android browser and it works fine.
