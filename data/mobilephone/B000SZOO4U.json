Hanly", "ReviewID": "R26THQSYGJKUNI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this phone.  Recently I joined T-Mobile and received a free violet Nokia 5300 and a Nokia 2610.  I kept the 5300 and gave the 2610 to my mother thinking that it would be an easier phone to use for an older person.  The 2610 was an awful phone and my mother was unable to figure it out.  To remedy this situation, I gave the Nokia 5300 to my mother and I took the 2610.  She was able to use the 5300 with no problem.  Of course, I had really liked the 5300, so I ordered this red one for myself.  I love the fact that the phone is very easy to use - that I can listen to music or audio books on it - and it feels so comfortable in my hand.  I'd have to say that it just fits.  It's thicker than most slider phones but I personally like that.  It's small enough to fit in my hand but not so small to be difficult to see or handle.  My only difficulty with this phone is that the volume seems low; however, it is better once I move my ear around and find the right spot for listening.  I have only had this new phone for a few days so far, so I need to adjust to it and also look in the book to see if the listening volume can be raised.  With the headphones on, the music and audio books sound great.  The speaker sounds pretty good with some static.  All in all, I love this phone.  This particular phone is an international phone, so just in case I do travel outside the country, I can use it.  Maybe I'll have to save some money and do that.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Decent, but fragile", "Author": "C. dillon \"christ for you\"", "ReviewID": "R1G14RXV74L3WX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pretty decent phone with good features, but this phone is very fragile. Lcd screen broke just being in my pocket, without dropping it. The warranty had run out. I only had it for two months. I had insurance with t-mobile, but the replacement phone was higher than what I paid for the phone. I got the phone on discount by entering a two year contract. I will never do that again. In short it was a bust. I feel I got ripped off.", "Date": "September 2, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000SZOO4U"}}
