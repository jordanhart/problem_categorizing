Never the less i overlooked thoses facts, because i needed a replacement phone and Nextel's are pricey.  When i powered on unit there was nothing.  I contacted the seller and they told me that i have might have to download and install the system for it.  Not really a problem, but that is something i think should have been check before they sent it to me, especially since they were advertising the unit as new.  After downloading and installing system unit worked okay, but some features did not work.  Will not buy from seller again.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Exactly", "Author": "NATASHA SALTER", "ReviewID": "R2D72I5C2ROU2M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product wasn't what I thought it was.

No response so far.It does not make any sense at all for you to sell this crappy phone that always shows the \"Sim Card Error\" message. It doesn't accept prepaid T-Mobile or Sprint sim cards. Technically, I need to unlock it.So who did you sell this one to me. Is the way you do your business?I want my money back!!!TJ", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Old Outdated Model", "Author": "Benjamin Thompson", "ReviewID": "R31538MMPDXVV3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I didn't like this phone because the features can't be used due to the phone being so old.
