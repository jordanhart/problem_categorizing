It is, however I don't think it's \"waterPROOF\". It's water RESISTANT. I drop this phone from 6 ft(out of a truck) daily, and it keeps on ticking. Of course, after 2 years of abuse it's on it's death bed. About 75% of the time now I can't hear the person I'm talking to, or trying to call. With a nice 'WHACK' to the face it repairs itself for a while. It also is starting to turn off like it has a short in it. I'd have to say it was a good phone for a \"free\" upgrade, and for the constant butt kicking I give it, it stays in the ring pretty well. I wouldn't pay more than $50 for a new one though just because of it's dated techno parts.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "kaykay2011", "ReviewID": "R35KIQBKBPYZR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this phone I needed a phone that I could text on and if I drpped it wouldn't break. This phone has great speakers and good signal. I put it through the wash and got it wet during a horrible rain storm and have dropped it down 3 flights of stairs and the only thing that doesn't work on it is the camera.

I love this phone, wish I would have gotten it for her 1st!!!!!  This is like the 7th phone she has gone through in 3 years.  Dropped in the sink, toilet, snow, just left it in the bathroom while taking a shower (for an hour.....) or maybe it broke from horse playing with her younger bother.  Whatever the case may be, unlike the others, this phone is holding up.  Not sure if it will last more than 6 months, hopefully, but its done better than most so far.  Can't really say a lot about features or use of the phone.  She txts about a million times a day and actually talks on it once in a while (usually only when I call).  The camera works well so far as I know.  But other than that, it is holding up to a 15 yr old, that works for me!", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "The phone is great.", "Author": "moviewatcher", "ReviewID": "R34JMQVR8221E0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had one of these before I really liked it  I had it for about 4 years and when I went to renew my contract with Verizon they did not make this hone any more,  well I got a free phone, but I could not hear it ring,  so I went to amazon and there she was.

Can't believe Verizon let this go to the wayside, the battery is amazing, up to 3-4 days of not having to charge, amazing, hubby says.
