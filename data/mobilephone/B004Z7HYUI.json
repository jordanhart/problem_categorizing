{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good entry Android phone", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "R20BL9JHALYDME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this phone for a few days now and here are the pros and cons.PROS:- Inexpensive- Awesome flexible plans with no contract, you can switch between plans to fit your needs on monthly basis.- Attractive design & compact size- Good speed, not the slowest nor the fastest, somewhere in between (as May 2011)- No blowware installed, good job Boost Mobile- Clear sound for phone calls & decent music player- Durable, I've dropped it a couple of times from waist height in parking lot and it barely shows any dents.Cons- Fixed focus low res cam (2MP) no LED. It takes OK pics in a good lighting environment, video quality is unusable. My biggest issue is that it CAN'T read standard bar code, due to it's fixed focal lens. But it reads QR code without any problem.- CDMA network covers less area than GSM network in the US. Most of countries in the world is using GSM network, so it won't work outside of US.- SIM card embedded, that means it can only be used on Boost Mobile network, maybe Sprint...BTW, Boost Mobile is using Sprint's network. You can't transfer contacts from your SIM card phone easily.- Screen resolution. It's not really a con, but it might be if you're used to hi end smart phones. It's the same resolution as 2gen ipod touch.- Battery, this is an issue with all smart phones.- Tiny Internal Memory, it is a big negative. Especially when navigation app downloads maps to its internal memory. Sometimes I have to delete some apps to make room for maps.(see my 1 year update at the bottom)Overall, I highly recommend it for causal users. Check out its coverage in your area before hand though.Things you would need to buy, if you plan to use this phone.- Micro SDHC, 2/3 of its internal RAM is occupied by OS and others. 2GB Micro SDHC that came with the phone is not going to be enough for most people. Make sure you get the Class 6 or above version of Micro SDHC. It makes noticeable difference in speed.- Car charger, they're not all the same. The main difference is how much power the charger provides. If you get one that provides minimum power, then your phone won't be charging much while the phone is using GPS & 3G for navigation. Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger This seems to be a good one.- extra battery, if you're always on the phone.Tips for new Android phone users, especially entry level phone like this one.- Read app's permission carefully. When installing an app, it will tell you what data on your phone it is accessing. Many \"free\" apps are collecting info in the background, often they collect info that has nothing to do with its function.This is not just a privacy issue, it also slows down the phone and drain its battery. If you're experiencing slow response and really bad battery issue, then it's probably because there are too many apps running in the background. These kind of apps send collected info periodically via wifi/3G, which is a major battery drainer. Get a Task Killer app, it lets you kill apps that run in the background.A general rule, stay away from apps that is accessing data has nothing to do with its function. For example, a workout app that wants to access phone's contact list and reads phone account info. You know it's data mining your phone for marketing purpose.Update: there is a work around for scanning bar code at book store. Google has an app called Shopper or Google Shopper. It can scan a book or CD/DVD cover from phone's camera and do a price search, an amazing app. Amazon App store gives away a pay app for free everyday, sweet!6/28/2011: Apparently Boost Mobile's 10 cent/minute Pay as You Go plan is not available to this phone yet. But $50/month unlimited everything is still the best deal by far.  Most of 4G data & phone plans from major carriers costs around $80 + tax & fees = $90/month, plus you lock in for two years. Sure, you get the latest smartphone with 4G speed for \"free\", but it's not free at all. Here's the math, you pay $40 more per month with other carriers' plan. So $40 x 24 months = $960, this does not include the Shrinkage discount. You have to ask yourself if 4G speed & latest smartphone is worth of $1000 more.Lastly, government charges tax & fee when you setup automatic payment to pay Boost Mobile account (it makes no sense whatsoever, but government wants more money). To avoid that, you have to put money in your account via reboost card each month manually. Luckily, you can buy electronic reboost card from major online store. They will email you the reboost code, then you just copy and paste it to your boost mobile account via website.9/13/2011: I've been using this phone for a few months now, and had no major issue until a couple days ago when I installed Pandora app. All hell broke loose after that, the phone froze up every couple hours. The phone works fine after uninstalled Pandora. Other than that, the I'm pretty happy with it. Remember to keep it lean, the more apps you add to it, the slower it gets.6/16/2012, the final update:I've been using this phone over a year now. Beside Making phone call, I don't do a lot with this phone other than navigation, texting and emailig (rarely). Overall, I'm happy with this phone & service. But I'm downgrading the phone from 4 to 3.5, based on price and hardware specs.The two biggest shortcomings are:1. Low MP camera, low resolution with a fixed focal length makes it almost useless.2. Internal Memory, even though I don't download and use many apps; I still need to delete some apps to make room for navigation map.As today, there are other Android phones with better hardware specs in the price range of 120-150. In the same price range, you can get mid range Windows Phone 7 device due to lack of its popularity. I just switched from Android to Windows Phone 7 today, because I rely heavily on MS Outlook and Onenote on my PC. Plus I really don't like how Google scans every Gmail,Gtask,GCalendar..etc for marketing purpose. Not to mention GPS tracking on your Android, it's getting out of control in my opinion.Anyways, Boots Mobile doesn't support Windows Phone 7 devices yet and I want to stay with a prepaid service. Luckily Straight Talk wireless(a branch of Tracfone)offers BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) prepaid plan at $45.00/month. BYOD works with most of GSM phones, and the phone doesn't need to be unlocked. So your current ATT & TMobile phone would work on StraightTalk BYOD plan.Things you need to know about StraightTalk:1. No roaming, that means you HAVE TO change your phone number if you move to an area outside of registered area for more than a few weeks.2. No streaming and tethering via 3G/4G. Even thought they call it Unlimited Data plan, there is a cap, most people thinks it's 2GB/month. You'll get a warning for going over it, your service will be terminated if you keep going over the limit. You will LOOSE your phone number. Read their TOA carefully.3. In order to make all of your smart phone's functions works on BYOD plan, you need to input some phone settings. It's pretty straight forward, but might be a bit challenge for some.Boost Mobile Shrinkage offers the best deal for casual users in the the long run. They now have a good selection of Android phones. If you're in the market for a prepaid Windows phone, StraightTalk BYOD is the only solution for now.Sorry if I don't reply your questions, I share what I know on this subject and don't check the comments often. It has been a pleasant experience with Boost Mobile and Android, cheers.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "I surprised how people are reviewing this phone!", "Author": "Doug Kampe \"DK\"", "ReviewID": "R18DU5ELBZOB1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for almost 2 months and it hasn't disappointed at all. In fact, completely the opposite! It's a small phone, but I like that personally. I can't stand how big phones have gotten like the EVO. Also, I don't know what people mean \"the phone is slow.\" What exactly are you doing? Personally, the phone works well for me. I multitask all the time: while biking I stream Pandora, track my location with MyTracks, and respond to the occasional text ALL AT THE SAME TIME. I stream music with Grooveshark in my car while navigating with GPS using Waze (awesome app btw). Never a problem! So, frankly, I'm confused what people are talking about \"slow\". Also, I'm on Boost's shrinkage plan so, my monthly bill is $45 per month for unlimited everything (including data).  I've been on Boost for about 8 or 9 months now.I read reviews on this phone because I find peoples' criticisms interesting. More often than not, people make one huge mistake: comparing it to a high-end phone like the iPhone, EVO, Nexus, etc. Look, it's not one of those, and if you want a top of the line phone, stop comparing this phone to those. No, it doesn't have the Hummingbird processor. No, it doesn't have a 4.3 AMOLED screen. Personally, I don't care about those things because they are too expensive, and if I get a phone that has those things, I'm locked into a 2 year contract for 3 or 4 times the monthly cost. If having a little better spec'd phone is important to you, go for the top of the liners! However, I'm techie, middle class guy that wants as much as I can get for as little as I can get it. The combination of this phone running Android 2.2.2 (I just got an update so that may be higher), and Boost's unlimited plan with shrinkage (eventually $35 per month) fits the bill perfectly for me.Also, there are lesser \"entry level\" Android phones out there. Sprint's Zeo is far far far inferior to this phone and the screen isn't double touch. The Prevail's is. Boost uses Sprint's CDMA towers with this phone, so I am never without service. You have to get into extremely remote places to lose reception, and those places will most likely be void of any cell coverage no matter the monthly cost barring satellite phones. Finally, maybe I'm lucky, but I just haven't experienced the shutting down and freezing problems others have. Sometimes this is a poorly designed app, NOT the phone or operating system. I've pulled the battery maybe 2 or 3 times total. I'll end this with a little math lesson.Let's compare Verizon VS Sprint VS at&t; VS Boost. So, the first 3 have smart phones from $0 to $300 with a 2 year contract. The Prevail is MSRP at $180, so to make an apples to apples argument, let's standardize the phone to $165. I'm doing this because you can find the prevail cheaper or more expensive. UNLIMITED contract's with the big 3 companies range from 69 per month (SPRINT) to $120 per month (Verizon/at&t;), so let's just say $95 per month on average. I should note, Sprint's plan is really good, unless you have family and friends overseas. You will incur international charges for INBOUND (received) calls on the $69 per month plan. I have family overseas and Boost does not do this, which is weird because they are owned by Sprint.  So, here's the math.Big 3=phone+(# of months * monthly cost)=  165+(95*24)  =  $2445 over 2 years.Boost=Phone+(6 months * $50/mo)+(6 months * $45/mo)+(6 months * $40/mo)+(6 months * $35/mo)=  165  + (300) + (270) + (240) + (210)  =  $1185 over 2 years.THAT'S A DIFFERENCE OF $1260 OVER TWO YEARS!!! Think about how hard $1260 is to make for the average person (me). So, if the top of the line phone is important enough for you, then that's great and you should do it. However, like I said in another review, personally, I'd rather take a trip to Europe, and for $1260 I am getting airfare to do exactly that!", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Phone, great deal", "Author": "E. Walker", "ReviewID": "R3G7GLDDZ8CEHL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a couple weeks. It is my first smartphone, so I'm no expert and I don't expect a lot.Overall I'm pretty pleased. The $50 a month unlimited plan from Boost is a great deal. The web speed is decent and you can view web pages fairly easily. It has an email app that allows you to collect POP email, which is handyCONS:The keyboard - This is a big one. It is near impossible to type on the on screen keyboard. I've ordered a stylus to type. I have fairly nimble fingers, and every fourth letter I type results in the adjacent letter appearing. There is some kind of \"swype\" application that might help. If you send a lot of text messages, this probably is not the phone for you... or at least you should try it.The battery - seems like it lasts one day or maybe three hours if you're using itNo flash supportPROS:The pricethe size - it is thin and small, but this also means a small screenIt is android and there are lots of apps out there, or you could write your own.You can put a 32GB card in this and use it like an mp3 playerit comes with a GPS app that has traffic - but I haven't tried it yetThe screen changes orientation if you move the phoneUPDATE:I've had this phone for a year now, and generally I'm pretty happy with it. It really does change your life to get a smartphone-- they're little computers. I've found so many useful apps, and it is really great not to have to count phone minutes OR data volume. I will never go back to limited minutes or data limits. I listen to internet radio for long drives, download recorded books from the public library, check email and many more more little things... iPhone users don't dare do all that with their data limits.I've gotten used to the screen size. The battery lasts a bit longer since the last upgrade, but it helps to have spare batteries and a car charger. The flash/youtube issue seems to have been fixed by one of the upgrades. I bought a 32GB memory card, and now use the phone as my mp3 player.Boost's service has been just fine-- good enough coverage, reliable voicemail, no screw-ups with the account. Because I've paid on time, it is only $40 a month.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this phone and price for the service can't be beat. Don't feed the AT&T; CEO salary contest!", "Author": "Lucas B", "ReviewID": "R3MSN0GJW0IGTM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're a smartphone maven with a high budget, you might want to look elsewhere.  If you have a non-smartphone with another carrier and want to upgrade your phone and cut your monthly bill, this is a great option to look at.I'm really impressed with this Samsung Prevail and activation was a breeze.  Love using navigation, email and maps on this phone.  There are more expensive android phones but this works great for me - screen and speed are fine.  I used an iPhone 4 thru work for a year and I don't miss the screen and apps - the Android apps look great and run fast.Why did we switch our personal phones to Boost? AT&T; notified me and my wife that our plan was being retired last month and our phones would be deactivated if we didn't sign up for a new plan.  The new plan increased our monthly fees by 50%, so we've been looking for a good value to replace our AT&T; dumb phones.The AT&T; CEO is currently in the top 10 paid CEOs.  He also makes the list for top 10 overpaid CEOs if you read analyst reports.  For the stellar performance of flat stock price for five years, Randall took home $29 million in 2010.  My wife and I couldn't stand the thought of helping him to reach #1 and this Boost phone made it an easy choice to dump our AT&T; phones.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "like the phone.", "Author": "Heyitsme", "ReviewID": "R3EM653YIZ9781", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a cheap phone that lets you access Android apps.  Didn't really bother with the manual, was intuitive enough to figure out.  The good news is you can get Angry Birds for free on this, the bad new is you can get Angry Birds for free on it.  Wasted time doing that, then deleted it so I can get things done.  GPS with traffic and turn by turn voice is free on the phone.  Need to recharge it at night, just get a charger for work or car then recharging is a non-issue.  Does voice dialing too, haven't played with that feature much, just once and it worked. I can keep up to date on my two major email accounts, text, play scrabble, check directions and traffic, check weather and map bike rides.  Camera is not tremendous quality, but is better than on my old cheap phone. This is my first smart phone, and was a great choice for me.  I rarely write reviews, but enjoy my phone enough that I was inspired to do so.  It's not an Iphone, but if you expect an Iphone for this price and this cheap a service plan, I think you'll be disappointed, and likely have unreasonable expectations about many things in life.Update:Still very happy (enough that I came back to update the review).  I bought two extra batteries and a separate cradle charger.  Cost $12 or so, and by keeping at least one of those charged, I can easily swap batteries and be at full charge, and don't have to worry about docking the phone.  For travel or long bike rides, I charge both and can use it heavily for a couple days without charging.  The battery is very accessible when you want to access it, but doesn't pop out when you treat the phone roughly.  I also accidentally briefly dunked it in the sink once, yanked the battery out as quick as I could, and dried both off quickly.  Left it in dry rice overnight and it was fine the next day.  YMMV, learn from my clutziness rather than trying it yourself.  The majority of apps I've wanted have been usable.

The coverage in my area is superb, and NO DROPPED CALLS!  I haven't experienced any dropped calls and the clarity is perfect.I actually came across this phone and the service quite by accident.  My friend asked me for a recommendation for service and I found Boost.  I was so impressed, I ended up ordering this phone and ported my number.  The port took all but 20 minutes, and to impress me further, a Boost agent called me to make sure all went well.I can't praise enough about their service, this phone, or the customer service.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Discontinued Phone With NO Room To Install Apps", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "RTWY6H2OV9AO5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "WARNING: The Prevail is a DISCONTINUED 2011 phone with NO room to install apps.

The memory is so small that downloading just ONE 2014 app and updating the standard Google apps can totally fill the memory and the phone then stops working.The Prevail's extremely small internal memory requires you move as many apps as possible onto an SD memory card. You must delete an app before you add a new app. Do NOT update Google Maps or YouTube...the updates are huge wastes of memory.I was able to double battery life by turning off turning off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and turning off 3G phone service. The 3G phone service is NOT necessary for phone calls or texting.  I turn on Wi-fi or 3g whenever I need to download email or want to use the internet, and then I turn them back off.

Nacht", "ReviewID": "R3LFZURAH6BD4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wake up and take another look at the price! This is one of two Android phones available on BoostMobile. You can decide whether to buy this phone very quickly rather than reading through dozens of reviews comparing features, size, performance, etc. The Samsung Prevail is a credible, very functional Android 2.2 phone. Want something faster, bigger, better camera, clearer and brighter screen? Your only choice is to sign a 2 year contract with one of the top tier cell carriers AND get a contract with a data plan. That data plan is going to cost you at least $30 to $50 more per month than the current Boostmobile rate of $50/month that steps down quickly to $35/month.You will spend $700 to $1500 more over two years to get a nicer phone than the Samsung Prevail. If you or your company's expense account have no problem with that, READ NO FURTHER. You should definitely get your Android phone from ATT, Verizon, TMobile or Sprint. Pick one at random and it will be faster, bigger, more memory, better camera, etc.The BoostMobile Samsung Prevail is an intentionally limited phone that runs on the Sprint network. Why is it limited? Sprint sells Android phones too and charges approximately double the monthly rate that BoostMobile does for equivalent voice and data plans. Sprint isn't going to allow BoostMobile to sell the same higher performance and more desirable Android phones that Sprint sells. Sprint would lose too much business to BoostMobile.The Samsung Prevail phone is simply excellent in performance for basic functions: email, contacts, calendar and task management. There is no perceptible processing delay in response time to key presses. I watch YouTube videos without a glitch. Same with Pandora streaming music. I have driven all over creation listening to my favorite Pandora stations over the Sprint network and there has never been a dropout or pause in music. Google Maps is a star performer too as is the included TeleNav GPS app. It provides better real time driving guidance than my car's Magellan GPS. Facebook Mobile works great and runs faster than I can tap keys.The downside but worth living with unless you really can justify the cost of having better:- Data speeds are throttled to 3G - you are not running at the current highest standard of 4G. For all of the apps I mention above it simply doesn't make any difference. Most cell phone users at top tier companies don't have anything more than 3G now anyway. App providers realize this and the smart ones don't assume anyone has a 4G phone. If you need to upload or download HUGE files, photos or videos.... yes, you're going to notice it's kind of slow.- The camera is frustratingly limited. You're not going to get a good picture unless you have perfect lighting conditions. Any simple cell phone you've had with a camera, even ten years ago, was better than this. This is the most obvious of the intentionally crippled features to force you to buy a Sprint phone on the Sprint network if you want better. Learn to live with it. You'll get OK snapshots in good light. I still carry my Canon digital camera when necessary for better pictures.- The processor is slow. All Google apps and all apps supplied with phone run great, no response time delays or waiting. Apps from the Android marketplace are hit or miss. Some are CPU intensive and you'll wait awhile after you tap a key before anything happens without any status showing while you wait. The phone looks locked up but it's not. You wait 3 to 10 seconds and it works OK. Popular apps I've downloaded that do this are GasBuddy, MapMyRide, NYTimes and Weather.com mobile. Weather.com is basically unusable. There are several other weather apps that run like lightning.- The screen is small. I personally like this. The Samsung Prevail fits in a front pants pocket and doesn't even show. No holster required. If you have big fingers it's going to take awhile to master hitting the right keys on the QWERTY keyboard. They become bigger in landscape mode, just turn the phone sideways to get this orientation displayed.- The small battery requires careful management. There's no way you're going to make it through longer than an 8 hour day without recharging. Charge when you can on your desk, on your night stand and in your car. Buy an extra battery, charge it and take it with you for backup if you are going to be off the grid for an extended time.I'm not a road warrior but have frequent need to be out and about and in touch with my Samsung Prevail. It works exceedingly well for all the basics I really need in a smart phone. Anything else it does is just icing on the cake.

I was so tired of being over charged for a 2 year contract and Boost Mobile has been amazing so far. The phone is a great basic smart phone. A few things I have learned to get the best out of it:1.) Be sure to move any apps you download over to the sd card so not to fill up the phone's internal memory space. (the phone will be more likely to glitch or freeze if it is too full. I did alot of resaerch before I even purchased the phone to make sure I avoided any problems and so far it has worked perfectly)2.) About once a week completely turn the phone off and and remove the battery for 30 seconds. (smart phones are like mini computers and need to be reset once and a while).3.) Be sure to read the manual that comes with the phone and learn all of things you can do to conserve battery power. (I make sure it shuts itself down into low power within 30 seconds if I am not using it, I always back completely out of apps or my browser instead of just hitting the home key when I am finished because if the apps are running in the background it is sucking battery life. Do a little research on the internet there are many other ways you can conserve the battery or you can download an app that will help but I have not needed to.) With regular use I can get 12-16 hours out of mine now, less when I play games or browse for long periods of time.4.) VERY IMPORTANT!!! Be sure to purchase screen protectors right away when you order your phone as I have read elswhere it scrathes very easily! I personally bought the glare/fingerprint resistant ones and they work like a charm and very easy to install. I also purchased a silicon case that protects the phone if dropped. Spending the few extra bucks to protect the phone will really pay off in the long run!If you are looking for a great fuctioning smart phone, but are on a budget like me, this is an excellent purchase. $50 a month for unlimited everything cant be beat. Be sure to visit the Boost mobile website and check out there coverage area map and see if they are in the area you live, because the amount of service you can get will greatly affect the phones performance. I have never had a dropped call, the internet always works, and I have never been more pleased with a cell phone provider!

There are a few things you need to know before purchasing this phone:1.  Boost phones do not roam.  You will drop calls even in metropolitan areas.  I suspect that this is true for all prepaid phones.2.  Do not use Boost as your primary phone line.  You may end up without a phone for nearly 2 weeks. If something goes wrong with your phone in the first year, not physical damage, then you have to send your phone off to Samsung to allow them to repair it. This will leave you without a phone for up to 10 days.3.  If you break your phone and opt to use insurance, it will cost you ~$70 for a replacement.  Insurance is only really useful if you break or lose your phone.4.  Boost Mobile is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had.  Very rarely will you get someone who takes ownership of your problem.  I had a very simple problem and I had to talk to 10 people to get it resolved.  Terrible!5.  I have had the phone for almost a year and it is coming to the end of its useful life. I have to pull the battery out because the touchscreen stops working at least once per day. I never knew the importance of having a storefront where you can receive technical support.  Boost offers no such option.  All technical support consists of resetting one's phone.  If you need support beyond that, you have to send it off to Samsung.So, buyer beware. Boost offers good prices and relatively good phones, but you will be sacrificing quite a lot for the price.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone and Service for the Price!  (buh bye AT&T;): Updated!", "Author": "Screenname808", "ReviewID": "R2Z7JHNCFHZABT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dear AT&T;,Thank you for the last four years of service, or lack of service. I sincerely hope my donation of $1500 a year (that's $6000 total) was appreciated. I promise not to miss the poor products (refurbished and repackaged) or the astronomical rate plans.REVIEW:::The Prevail stomps my Motorola Blur (AT&T;) into last year with faster downloads, computer to usb capability, design features and much more.Awesome for any pocket, the phone is slim and light weight. The screen is beautifully clear, doesn't grease too easily, and provides a good viewing size for Youtube. Wifi capable; pretty fast internet and download speeds on both 3G and Wifi. There's voice texting for tired thumbs (feature recognizes speech). The phone takes photos and videos; quality is good for a cell phone. Best feature (to me) about the Samsung Galaxy Prevail is the usb flash drive capability. The phone is quickly recognized by my computer and easy to load music onto..no waiting time (no synching). The texting could be better (input method) but the voice texting speeds up text time. I say good job Samsung.Purchased the phone at Radio Shack with RS warranty (able to walk into a RS and get new phone). The call clarity is good (AT&T; is slightly better) and so far the phone has not dropped a call or lost signal. Phone calls from out of state are very clear! Boost is basically Sprint, the service is good and bars are available. The unlimited plan is actually $55 plus your state tax ($60.23 for me).BONUS:: Boost's shrinkage plan will reduce the bill to $40 (plus state tax) after 18 months. Payments must be made on time for 18 months to qualify. AT&T; does not reward on time payments for long term customers.There's no contract, it's the best phone I've owned and I'm saving over $800 a year. Excellent all the way around.***The Goal: save money, have a great phone/plan and carrier. Goal accomplished. If your contract is over with AT&T; or Verizon take the time to calculate all the money you have spent. (Make sure a toilet is nearby). After you are done being sick, buy this phone and unlimited plan! Save yourself money and feel good with a fixed bill. Take the money you will save and pay down a credit card, go on vacation, put away money for college, buy stocks, buy food or just save your precious funds!*Update: Still satisfied with this phone and the savings. Although Boost only offers a few phones at this time period  of 2012, I'm convinced they will supply additional phones in the future. Everything unlimited for $50 a month is gorgeous baby. ;)**Update December 16th 2012: Lost my original phone in October and purchased this phone again. Still love it! Now my service is $45 a month and this December I have money for gifts and school; plus paid my monthly household bills. It's nice to not be spending my extra money on air. I've noticed my service has improved on my new phone (a tower might have been added to the area) and the call clarity is excellent.***Final Update September 10th 2013: My service with Boost Mobile is now $40 a month for unlimited everything. I figured out the total cost of ownership (of the galaxy prevail over 24 months) and it boiled down to $8.25 a month to own this phone. It would have been less if I had not lost the original phone. I've enjoyed saving money and the galaxy prevail features (maps, camera phone/video, excellent battery life, durability and quality). I've upgraded this week and am excited to gain a ton of internal memory with the Samsung Galaxy S2. Yes, I realize the S2 is not the latest and greatest, however, Boost is offering an incredible price on this phone. I believe you should not pay more for a phone than a tablet or laptop ($250). Side Note: I would continue using the Prevail, however, the internal memory is under 1 gig and the built in applications cannot be moved to the additional sd card. I've enjoyed saving roughly $2000+ over the last two years with Boost Mobile. Best thing about Boost Mobile is there's no contract. If you don't like the service you can go shack up with Verizon or AT&T.; Personally, I think people are figuring out that \"contracts\" are just a nice way of saying \"wallet vacuuming\".", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Prevail Galaxy", "Author": "J.

Don't waste your time.", "Author": "Geodude", "ReviewID": "R2YM4YQ0WYMXGI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did my research and read up on people's reviews before I bought this phone.  What surprised me is that no one has pointed out the Samsung Galaxy Prevail's most prevalent flaw: ITS LACK OF INTERNAL HARD DRIVE SPACE!The phone comes with a 200 MB internal hard drive (PATHETIC!), but only 161 MB of it is actually usable.  The OS and default applications that you actually NEED such as Market, web browsing, camera, etc. all take up about 100 MB of space, leaving you with a PUNY LITTLE 60 MB of internal space to play with.  Although you can transfer apps you download from the internal drive to the external SD card (which is 2GB included), every app that you download still takes up space in the internal drive, even after transferring the app.So what does this mean?  After downloading and transferring about 10-15 apps (depending on their size) ... YOU'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF SPACE.  There is nothing you can do at this point, but to delete apps that you've downloaded in order to make room for new ones.  Purchasing a larger SD card will not alleviate the problem either - the lack of space in the internal drive will prevent you from having more than 10-15 apps installed on your phone, even if they're transferred to the SD card!There are workarounds to this of course.  You can \"root\" your phone and (hopefully) transfer the default programs from the internal drive, onto the external SD card.  But there are two problems present in this scenario: 1) You need to be fairly technically savvy to know how to hack into your phone and do this, and 2) YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HACK INTO YOUR PHONE IN ORDER TO GET AROUND THE FACT THAT THE HARD DRIVE IS PATHETICALLY SMALL AND NEAR UNUSABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE!This phone is definitely a phone for the most casual of casual users.  If you don't plan on doing much more than texting, Facebook, YouTube, and Angry birds, this phone is for you.  HOWEVER.

The positives for me is the PRICE- for the service- I got in before Androids were $5 more so I only pay $50 a month but that will drop next month down to $45.  I also got the insurance with it and pay an extra $5 a month in case I break it or loose it- worth it for me since I have 4 kids and lots of accidents.

Then you can Move all the needed file from the Delvik Cache to the system rom.This took my app space from 30mb free to over 75mb free.

Those being: 1.) the skimpy camera with no focus and no flash; 2.) the limited internal storage; and 3.) the problem the phone has with freezing up 3 - 4 times per day.  But what is probably not so well know is how the new OS upgrade has affected these issues.About 5 days ago, I received a request on my phone to upgrade from Froyo (2.2) to Gingerbread (2.3).  The new operating system has affected two of these major issues.  Obviously, the camera still cannot focus and still has no flash.  But the freezing issue seems to be completely gone!  However, it appears that Gingerbread eats up about 10 - 15 more megabytes of internal storage.  That may not sound like allot if you have one of those fancy super phones with over 2 gigabytes of internal storage, but when using the prevail, every megabyte counts.Still, I'd have to say that the fix to the freezing issue outweighs the extra storage usage.

It only lasts about 6-7 hrs.I knew this when I purchased it so I also ordered extra batteries AND a charger from here:[...]I carry my batteries everywhere that I go so my phone never dies. Battery issue resolved!Like I said I am new to the android experience and I can now understand why a lot of android owners are always making a mad dash somewhere to plug in/charge their phones. Get some extra batteries and a car charger ASAP!I also purchased a phone case, stylus, screen protector, car charger and an earpiece. All of these items have been so useful as well especially the stylus.I have had no problems at all with my phone service, internet service, texting, any of the apps nor with customer service which I have heard can be very challenging.I have a terrible sense of direction so the GPS does come in handy. It is amazingly accurate! I use it all of the time.All of this for $50, ($49.88 if you visit Walmart and purchase a Boost card) cannot be beat.My experience with this phone and with Sprint customer service so far has been exceptional.Simply put, I am loving this phone and I would certainly recommend it.Peace & Light!", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great deal", "Author": "Jeffrey Pollard", "ReviewID": "R1RAJWE2GK70H2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone works great.

Alot of people have complained about the battery life. At first I was a little disapointed but then I got the apps, Advanced task killer and Widgetsoid. Advanced task killer turns off all of your aplications that are running in the background and killing your battery life that you are not using. Wigetsoid alows you to set up a more advanced power manager wiget that is more advanced then the one that comes with the phone. Widgetsoid alows you to turn on and off wifi, bluetooth and gps just like the widget provided by the phone. It also alows you to turn off 3G (mobile data)when you don't need to use the internet. Once 3G is turned off the phones battery life increases dramtically. Then when you need to use the internet its a quick tap of the widget and you are back up and running. (Do to the fact that the phone is CDMA you have to go into the advanced tab and switch the data toggle mode from APN remname to APN toggle. Once you do that you will be up and running).Otherwise the phone is responsive and the service is really provided by sprint which is rated the number two network (behind verizon) by consumer reports.

If you're away from your car and home charger all day, you better bring some portable juice along.At first I had a problem with the phone locking up or freezing. The salesman at Best Buy told me that many Android phones have issues with Pandora. I'll keep this updated, but it looks like removing Pandora from the phone makes it run better and stops the freezing issue.I highly recommend \"No Lock\" if you don't like having to swipe the phone practically every time you pick it up.With Youtube ,sometimes it takes a little while for things to start up. There are occasional pauses in videos. Usually it's ok. This isn't 4G. But usually, the wait period isn't bad.I miss the dial pad of a real cell phone, but the ability to sync all my contacts with Gmail is fantastic. Plus with the search button and speech to text, I can often speak out loud the name of a business and the town it's in, and I will get the listing. Amazing!Where I live, you just cant get a phone this rich in features coupled with a plan this inexpensive. You can get a better phone, but you're going to have to go with a company that's charging at least $20 more per month.I used to have US Cellular, and I was told by a friend that I talk with regularly that my voice and voice mail are a lot clearer now. It could be the phone I used to have, some Motorola model that cost me over $100 a year and a half ago.The camera is very good, better than the 2mp that came with my Motorola. I haven't tried out the video yet. A great thing about the phone being an Android is that miraculously, the thousands of pictures I had stored in Picassa started appearing in my picture gallery.I've seen other smartphones with bigger screens, and all I can say is that when viewing a web page, the bigger the better. You're not going to want to gather around at Thanksgiving watching the football game on this thing, but you can watch something cute on Youtube before going to bed, or you can listen to a favorite podcast or Pandora station while taking a walk.I'm really happy with this phone, but I do foresee being challenged by the weak battery and having to plan for the hours that the phone cannot be tethered.I'm changing the phone from 4 to 3 stars because it's a little buggy.

I have had the Prevail for a year; I got it the day it was released, and it has worked well.The hardware in the phone is a step down. Although this is a true android phone, with market and other apps, the hardware is the issue.For instance, my wife has a motorola atrix duo-core 1ghz. You click angry-birds, and it launches immediately, and runs flawlessly.The prevail is a single core, 800mhz. I click angry birds... and wait. It finally launches, and runs jittery. After playing for a few minutes, the phone is obviously working too hard, as the battery heats up. (Reminds me of old analog phones, and they power they used to run). I have to monitor the task manager and close apps, to help other apps run better.I have found a few apps that are 100% unsupported by my phone. (I forget the name, but the app that allows me to pay the meter for my car while parked downtown.) They will not install.The other issue is the internal storage. There are only 164Mb of internal storage, and the OS uses that space too. While I found an app that will many apps over to the SDcard, and run them there, the performance is degraded. Plus, all apps run some information in the cache of the phone, using more space.With only a few apps on the phone, I am down to 11mb of storage. This further degrades performance.The new boost android phone uses out of date, minimal hardware. It's the equivalent of trying to run a 3 cylinder Geo in the express lane and keep up. If you don't put anything in the trunk, you might be okay. But, if you just did some shopping, and have some friends in the car with you, it just falls short every time...Good for now.. but shopping for alternatives.

The phone is just right sized- it's smaller than most android phones but I actually prefer it that way.  It's perfectly sized to operate with one hand.The phone works perfectly fine- as long as you're not trying to run too many apps the performance is good.  All in all a really great middle-of-the-road value smartphone.  Except for one huge problem.What every single other review fails to mention is that the phone only includes a paltry 200 MB of internal storage.  200 MB is NOT a lot of memory.  Yes you can expand it with a microSD card- I have a 32 GB in mine- but it's not really a solution.  Only certain apps can install to a microSD card.  The VAST majority of apps CANNOT install to a microSD card.  What's more is that apps that do install to microSD only do so partially- they still take up part of the internal storage.  The only thing a microSD card is really good for is media- music, photo and video files.So you're left with an extremely limited amount of internal storage.  Enough for maybe 2-3 dozen apps.  On top of your limited storage you're stuck with half a dozen bloatware apps- apps that you cannot uninstall.  Pretty useless junk like Layar, Point, and ThinkFree Office.  Thinkfree is a huge space sucker- it's about 10 MBs when you uninstall all the updates.  Even if you uninstall all the updates for the bloatware apps they still suck up about 30 MB of your 200 MBs of internal storage.More space will be taken up by the Android 2.3 update, updates for Maps, Gmail, Search, etc.  You get the picture- not a lot of storage.  I'm constantly searching for things to delete to make room for new apps, deciding which apps I don't need and can remove, or downloading apps, using them, and then deleting them immediately.It's a shame because other than that it's actually a really great phone.

It's a well-made phone without a lot of bloatware installed, runs well, no freezeups or reboots needed. I've installed a whole host of applications from the Android market and it digested them all. We tried streaming Netflix via WiFi. Passable, but not stellar. There were a few dropped frames here and there but the video was more than watchable given how, just a few years ago, people weren't even doing this on most netbooks.I like the build quality. It feels solid, without a lot of loose or questionable parts to fall off. Sound quality is decent, and reception is on par with any other phone we used in the past. The screen is a bit smallish to use with my fingers, but my wife manages fine.Keep in mind that this lacks a lot of the bells and whistles of higher end Android phones. The camera is pretty bad. Video quality no better than any 5 year old camera phone. No autofocus on the camera either, so you're not going to be using the barcode scanner apps because they don't work. You get a small amount of onboard storage, but a 2Gb microSD card is included. This means you'll need to put most of the apps you install on the sd card.Battery life is okay, but not great. Watch out for the behind the scenes battery drains, in particular apps like Facebook or Yahoo Mail really suck down the battery life.All in all, when you consider the price and the fact it's a no contract phone, you can't really go wrong with the Prevail.

I will explain:For my general use: I browse the internet, Google search on the go, Facebook..of course, and pretty much call and text. I don't use it for those things when I am home seeing as we have a desktop computer that does all of that much faster, but I didn't expect mobile web to be blazing fast in the first place...so no let downs there. The battery lasts me all day generally and I don't really have many problems on a day to day basis. It really is a great android phone for the price if you want an android and unlimited plan for cheap to browse the web and stay in touch when you aren't at home. (Of course it works for the basic cell phone needs.)On the other hand, I've noticed that the longer I have it...the slower it gets. I haven't downloaded any new applications because I don't have any room; I had to delete most of the ones that I did download because the RAM was full to the brim and nothing would move to my SD card. The phone slowed down significantly when the new \"Android Unlimited\" plan came out in October and I wasn't on it because it wasn't available when I bought the phone in July, but that's neither here nor there since I could upgrade to the Android plan any time. Samsung has never done me wrong, and this phone is really no exception. I dropped this phone in puddles, down stairs, in my driveway...anything. It has come apart on impact a number of times and it STILL works better than many of the previous phones I've had (such as LG, Motorola...blah blah blah) that I've put through my usual abuse (I'm clumsy, it's not that I just throw my phone around, not that anyone cares). My only problems really came with the space and...bringing me to my next biggest problem: Force Close.This phone has a problem with shutting down things it should be able to run NO problem. A majority of the time, it runs everything smoothly, but when it force closes one app...it will force close EVERY app, internet search, text...anything...until you restart the phone. It sometimes comes to the point when I have to put the phone down and leave it for the day for the fear of throwing it.Other than the space and the force close...I'm pleased. Samsung still hasn't failed me majorly.I do not recommend this phone for people looking to play games and whatnot on your phone...not a good idea.

I bought it on ebay for about $150, and I used it as my laptop. I couldn't afford a real laptop at the time, and I remember thinking it was one of the coolest things on earth. I always wished that I could have used it as a phone as well. We take these things for granted now, but it is pretty damn cool that you can buy a device with the power of a decent laptop for under $150 today. This phone is not perfect, but it is a great deal. You get a small, fairly powerful computer, with phone, mp3, video, etc. If you are thinking of making the jump to a smart phone or to boost mobile, this is a great choice. It's not bad out of the box, but if you root it and customize it, this thing rocks. I didn't really anticipate becoming so enamored with this phone, but I did. You can download emulators and use it as a gameboy, snes, or genesis, you can watch movies, use it as an ereader, and more. I have been very happy with Boost, and I have been very happy with this phone in particular. You have to put in a little work to get it running as smoothly as we all want it to, but its possible and its worth it. Look for shabby's mod for a good starting place.Update:After having the Transform Ultra for a while now, I kind of miss the Prevail. I have to say, I'm pissed at Samsung right now (having problems with the Ultra), but they did a good job on this phone. In the broader family of Android phones, the Prevail is definitely on the lower end, but it is also a really good deal. Probably the only things keeping from going back to the Prevail are:1) The camera is not that great. It's hard to get a good picture with it, but it is possible. No LED flash is also hard to deal with after getting used to having it. This wouldn't necessarily be a deal breaker for me, except that with a decent camera on my phone now I can catch my daughter doing cute stuff.2) The meager internal memory gets really frustrating if you like to install a lot of games. There is always the option to move files to the SD card, but most apps still leave a few megabytes behind and fill up the memory very quickly.3) I actually like the smaller screen size. These massive phones that are coming out don't appeal to me at all. Having said that, typing with my big fingers on the touch screen is really difficult.If you are on Boost I suggest that you seriously consider the Prevail before the Ultra. Save yourself $100+ bucks and get more than what you've paid for. If you don't care too much about the camera, don't have big fingers, and don't plan to go nuts installing apps, this phone is probably the best bet for you. The ZTE warp is another option if you want more power, a better camera and bigger screen, and are willing to shell out an extra $80 bucks or so. I recommend that you think twice about the Transform Ultra though, I've been having a lot of problems with it and there's no telling if or when Samsung is going to fix it.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "very nice", "Author": "Jennifer8181", "ReviewID": "R2ZQLE4IZPOSSP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phone is very nice.. like most smart phones.. battery life sucks.. so I suggest getting another battery and docking wall charger but other than that.. great phone.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'll be ordering another one soon!!!", "Author": "B", "ReviewID": "R3NBYWI6IYH0K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited a few weeks of having the phone before I decided to write a review.

Immediately I noticed that when making calls you had to swipe the screen and push the top power button to actually talk on the call. Terrible! This is for EVERY call. It actually annoyed me so much I thought of returning it, but I thought about the price point and the other benefits and got used to it.

I save about $40 compared to Boost's site for ordering the phone and it came packaged brilliantly. I already find myself using this for all the fun apps and internet usage I have been missing out on.

But from this point this phone became my primary. Yes, it has a few problems: small internal memory, occasional loss of signal (in idal state; just boot it), occasional self-boot. Those are tradeoffs of having \"entry-level\" Android 2.3 phone. On the plus side it is small-but-usable Android phone that - in my current configuration - allows me to have full free domestic phone service (plus low-rate international - using Google Voice), text messages, check and reply to emails (I'm not allowed to use my work laptop for this). Battery life isn't good to hold just over a day in _default_configuration_ (sic!), but with Android free power control/saving apps (I'm using Juice Saver on it, but it's not only option) it holds perfectly well: I'm often ending day with more than 50% left (when using Blue Tooth 100% of the time with GPS and WiFi off). On-screen keyboard needs to get used to (I still not always getting intended button), but it's functional for its task.

The on/off button is very hard to press and you end up with shoulder pain. I would not recommend this phone or the next ones in the series.

Power users should probably keep a spare battery around but this is the same with all Androids in my experience.- The Swype keyboard is excellent- It's Boost Mobile, it runs on the Sprint network and has all the excellent coverage Sprint provides but it's only $55 a month, and less if you pay on time!The Cons:- The phone comes with a severe lack of storage, and a bunch of preloaded apps you'll hardly ever use that cannot be moved to the SD card.  Be prepared to only install the Apps you truly want and rotate the ones you use less often.  Bad move by Samsung.- The 2MP camera is garbage, has no autofocus and no flash.  Good luck scanning QR codes.  I won't even mention the video recording.- The screen scratches VERY easily, get a case and a screen cover.- The Swype keyboard is great, but if you don't use it typing on the keyboard is an exercise in frustration.Bottom line: If all you want is a phone with a few \"smart\" features and not much else then this is the phone for you.

The Samsung Galaxy Prevail, however, should not be sold on the market.  It's that bad.  The cell was advertised as Android 2.2, but little did I know that flash does not work on it.  That's right, they purposely disabled flash (one of the biggest advantages of owning an Android over an iPhone).The phone itself is extremely buggy, and is constantly crashing resulting in a reset of the phone or just a power-off (which is extremely unfortunate when I'm waiting for people to call me and I don't realize my phone has shut itself off).The phone has very little internal memory, but, considering how little it has, it makes it impossible to use this phone as a smart phone.  If you purchase this phone, you will not be able to download more than one or two apps.  Period.  I used the expansion slot to add 16 Gb of space, but it did me almost no good as most apps need to run off the phone.  Apps that would be able to run off the memory stick I cannot download either, as the phone itself does not have enough space to allow download and transfer to the memory stick.Also, the phone is now experiencing a kind of drive failure that has disabled me from downloading or updating any apps on the phone.  I am going to have to buy a new phone at this point.To summarize, if you are looking for a good smart phone then stay away from the Samsung Galaxy Prevail.

The camera quality is decent but the clicker is placed in such a weird spot it is difficult and not worth the trouble to take your own pics.

The people who say the battery is bad was not lying, the battery is NOT the best. 5 hours at best, and it charges 20 percent an hour, which makes it 5 hours to charge back fully, although I turn my phone off to charge it which charges faster imo. Overall this phone is MILES better than any other boost phones, and trust me i've had a lot. As for the getting the boost folk on the phone issue their menu constantly changes, sometimes I get a person sometimes I don't. I usually google how to get a person on boost mobile and click on a recently updated site with the info on how to bypass the options to get to a person. So far on every phone i've had through many calls recalls bad advice hangups and so I have always managed to get whatever problem fixed although it was a pain to do so.

I bought this for my mom as there are some good texting apps that let her text her relatives in other countries for free. The phone is pretty small and that makes the touchscreen keyboard small too, but the swype keyboard that comes with it helps out a lot in that aspect. After only using it a few weeks, she already wants the galaxy s now so she can install more games on the phone... Which comes to the bad parts of the entry level phone, there is very limited phone memory which means you can't install many apps before it runs out of space. Although apps2sd does help out with that a little bit and so does the 16 gb micro sdhc card I put in there. Too bad it can't completely move the entire app over to the external sd card and not all apps can be moved.All in all, if you need an entry level phone, this is a great phone.

I've had it since (the MINUTE) it came out, and have been putting it through it's paces. Sure, it is slower than some of it's Galaxy brethren, and no, it does not have a super AMOLED screen. It's a sub-$200.00 phone, for Pete's sake!The phone itself is esthetically beautiful. Sharp and compact, it has an elegant look and feel. The touch surface seems to be plastic, rather than glass, so I'd recommend a quality protector. I opted for the Zagg screen protector, well worth the twenty-dollar asking price.The camera is good! I've captured some great images from this and recommend the camera as good (albeit, a 2.0 MP). Have coupled this with a few well-chosen Camera Apps to get some very nice photos. For those reviewers around the web who slam this, remember - it is a 2.0 MP camera, they do NOT promise anything more (or great).Freeze ups ... yes, some of what you've read around the internet it true, at least from my vantage point as an owner / user - there are freeze ups, from time to time. What I've experienced so far, has been sparse, limited, and for a few seconds at at time. I have never had to actually reboot the phone, so I wonder if some of the freeze-up stories may be exaggerated. I can say with certainty, this is NOTHING like the Intercept, and nowhere near what you'll read online.I also have an issue with reviewers around the web, stating they experience \"constant\" selecting of the \"wrong link\", etc. I have experienced none of that, and I'm not a particularly advanced user. Perhaps these advanced reviewers are (typically) too smart for a \"dumb\" phone like this ... or maybe they just have fat hands.Small Bonuses ... I found it odd that Samsung (thoughtfully) pre-installed a File Browser (My Files), and a Task Manager. The file browser is excellent, and I think it's great to find one pre-installed.Though the jury is still out on Task Managers (some think they are great, others think they are not), I found this pre-installed gem to be much easier to work than others I've used (on other phones) from the Market.  There is also a \"Think Free Office\" pre-installed - I went ahead & signed up then tested this out, and it's a nice little bonus.This phone (and Boost service) were good enough for me to port an 11-year phone number (and service) from one of the major providers.As to some of the negative \"reviewers\", commenters and nay-sayers out there:  They can rag all they wish on this little device, as they rejoice in the splendor of their Droids, iphones and other superior hardware.

This phone doesn't have enough internal memory to update any of the preloaded apps on there, which means you also don't have enough room to put any more apps on there, say for instance, facebook or pandora. Let alone any games. Not being able to use any of the apps basically negates any pro's it might have for being a touch screen 'smartphone'. Another severe annoyance is the notifications ringtone. If you get a voicemail, the phone can't update an app (and my phone can't EVER update google talk) or you get a text message there is no way to differentiate ringtones for these various different things. I have to check the phone whenever I hear the ringtone because it MAY be a text, though it's usually a notification that it couldn't update google talk. Unable to express how annoyed this makes me. Also, the battery is just junk. If I make 3 phone calls and then don't use the phone at all, it's dead within 6 hours. I bought this phone as a way to not only make phone calls and texts, but as a way to check my facebook and email when I'm away from my laptop.

There is no tech department. Consumers are encouraged to do everything themselves; that is, activate the mobile phone using the Boost website or listening to prerecorded instructions use a phone number pad. This is fine with me--I prefer this method. But if there's a problem and you need technical support, Boost isn't going to help you. Consumers can try to contact a customer service representative but the phone menu is set up to make it virtually impossible to contact a representative (Sprint cares more about saving money than providing good customer service). After several tries, I contacted a customer service representative who \"activated\" my phone. The rep told me it would take up to 24 hours to activate. The phone never worked so I called customer service again a couple of days later (again, after several tries at navigating the phone menu from Hell). The customer service rep set up my phone for activation again and told me that it would work within an hour. The phone never activated. I called back but could not get through the labyrinthine phone menu Sprint devised to discourage consumers from contacting its outsourced customer service reps. The phone menu hung up on me 3 times for pushing the wrong button and I had to call back and start all over again. I finally gave up and tried to cancel my account but I was informed that Boost never cancels an account; they just inactivate it and keep your credit card information.I ended up filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. At this point, I just wanted to cancel my account and return the phone for a refund. After a few days, Stan from Sprint Executive offices in Fort Worth called me. Stan gave me the usual perfunctory apologies and talked to me in scripted corporatese with a Texas accent. He wasn't very good at it. After about 10 minutes he said, \"I'm going to talk to you like a human being.\" He then became my best friend and got very chatty. Stan advertises himself as a Christian. He loves Jesus, believes in the right to bear arms, and home schools his children (so they can grow up to be as smart as him and reject scientific facts). This idiot was the guy that was in charge of resolving my complaint. He didn't solve any of my issues I had with Boost and Sprint. I ended up filing a complaint with the FCC.If you are still thinking about signing up with Boost, let me make a suggestion. Call their customer service number for information about how to activate a phone. See if you can get a hold of a human being that can help you. I think then you will be convinced. As for me, I will never ever ever use Boost or Sprint again.Sprint did one thing for me. It motivated me to look at other plans.

The only way togain back control on the phone was to remove the battery..yuck.  I called Boost and of course they sent me to Samsung. I called Samsung and they had me ship the phone to them, it took them almost three weeks to \"fix\" it.  I wouldn't mind the time if they have fixed the phone but they didn't. To make a long story short, I tried with 5 different headsets, two of them Samsung brand, and after having a long conversation, 10 minutes or more, the phone willfreeze or reboot. You have to remove the battery to be able to gain access to the phone. If it weren't for this issue, I would give the phone a 4 stars, but this is too much.
