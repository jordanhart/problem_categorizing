She absolutely loves this phone. She's a HUGE texting princess and she finds it very easy to use.The querty board is what we love on our phones, and the option to use it as a regular cell phone, or slide it to open up the querty board is a bonus to this phone.The phone also has the data capability, but we just use it as a regular phone. We've tried touch screens, but they need to be recalibrated once a year, and they are not as nearly easy to use. We like the feel of the buttons of the querty board!", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "My son and I love this phone.", "Author": "J.

So, as stated before, I was not in love with my first gravity two, but after looking at a lot of expensive over the top phones that are out now, this seemed to be the more logical choice for me.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Needed a new phone", "Author": "shirley morales", "ReviewID": "R3MBPB31FEV47G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice phone My son loved it , has a very long battery life, easy to use option to use the slider or the front keyboard which is great!", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE", "Author": "akorrr", "ReviewID": "R2EMU2V9ES6IFI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recieved a locked phone that i can do absolutley nothing with.
