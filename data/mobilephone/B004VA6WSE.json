{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nexus S i9020A Thoughts and Impressions", "Author": "Mr. Cory", "ReviewID": "R2IZE2EEQCUPRR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nexus S is the follow up flagship handset to the Nexus One, which I still own. It is a much better experience having a vanilla build OS vs a custom OS which can hinder overall performance, not to forget being free of carrier control and restrictions! There are a few specs the phone has that can be a turn off to someone who is into having the latest tech implemented; but overall it is a very good phone that I'm glad to have purchased.Cons:-It's not a 4G phone, which really isn't a problem because in the U.S. 4G hasn't been fully deployed. WiMax and HSDPA+ is more like 3.5G.-It doesn't have the solid build of the Nexus One, rather a plastic feel to it which may seem a bit cheap. $600.00 is a lot for a plastic body.-No MicroSD slot ( a huge flaw, the phone is limited to only the 16 GB onboard storage.-The speaker is on the back of the phone.-The video isn't HD.Pros:-Very Speedy thanks to 1 GHz Humming Bird processor.-Gingerbread onboard, and because it's vanilla build it will have the updates in a more timely matter. Some newer phones have Froyo 2.2, and it will be months before they receive 2.3.-Gorgeous display with great color and black levels.-The contour display is no gimmick, the phone feels comfortable against the ears.-Once implemented, the NFC will allow the phone to behave like those in Japan, making it a digital wallet.I own a iPhone 3G, 3GS, iPhone 4, Nexus One, and this phone! There is one Blackberry user in my household, and she will cross over soon! I can argue iOS vs Android but ultimately it's up to the end user, they both have their pros and cons!", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "One of the best phones you'll ever love", "Author": "Spencer K Yarman", "ReviewID": "R2L4OKB5Z463O1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Nexus S is one of the best phones I've ever had.  I have oddly had the chance of using quite a few Android phones, but the Nexus S lives up to it's Nexus namesake. It is a perfect example of what an Android phone should be. It's form factor is pleasing and ergonomic. The screen is vibrant and readable. The audio call reception is clear and strong. And, being a Nexus phone, it is easy to root, and has a large selection of ROMs available to offer you a variety of user interfaces and experiences. I loaded an ICS rom and have never looked back! And, being an unlocked phone, you have your choice of carriers ( I chose Straight Talk...its cheap and unlimited!). I have nothing bad to say about this phone. Best purchase I've made in a long time.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$638.95", "Features": "WIFI\nGPS\n16GB Internal\nTouchscreen\n5mp camera", "Name": "Samsung Google Nexus S Smartphone with US 3G, 5MP Camera, Android OS, Touch Screen - No Warranty - White", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31N2tBzbcVL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004VA6WSE"}}
