First off, starting it, \"DEMON\" in big bold letters appears.. Creepy? Then trying to type a message is absolutely AWFUL. I have to wait for it to catch up before pressing the space bar. Typing a simple message takes me 5 minutes compared to 1 or 2. To get the phone to unlock from the screen, you have to do it 3 or 4 times, or just push it really hard. The camera is crappy. I downloaded Facebook, Tumblr, and Youtube and the storage was already full. -NOT TO MENTION- the first night I had this phone, the 1st battery, stopped working. Looks like a nice phone, but I'm utterly disappointed in it..", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "worst phone ever", "Author": "Elizabeth csutoros", "ReviewID": "R2SL940SHUX2PX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wasted my money on this phone.

Further more, my phone does not have GPS so I can't receive data to my sports tracker app that I use to calculate time, distance, speed and calories burned when I cycle or walk. Not very happy with this phone and the scary part is, I don't know how much it would cost to get it changed to the USA network grid or whether or not GPS can be installed.
