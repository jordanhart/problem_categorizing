{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good for the price", "Author": "enjoy st lucia", "ReviewID": "R3USE3XVZGACZX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone meets my expectations for a device of this price. It has a sharp bright screen which is responsive but scratches easily (although it looks like it has a screen protector installed). The phone had no problems  recognising both sims and offers options on which  sim to use for any particular phone call and which sim to assign for your data plan. I had no problems with connecting with wifi and phone calls  are loud and clear. The phone comes with some chinese apps installed but can access google play store or Amazon app store to download apps of your choice. I am not yet able to delete the cheezy home screen that is pre installed but it offers a few other (better)choices. Battery life is great (more than 24 hours) when wifi is off, but lasts only about 6-8 hours with wifi on. I like the idea of the 2nd battery which is included although I have never had any reason to use it. For all you android newbies, there is a learning curve so it may take you a while to discover all the features of this phone. Note that this is a 2G only phone so while I am ok with it, it might not be suitable for everyone. What I like least about this phone is that the keys for typing are a little small so i constantly have to correct my letters - otherwise the phone is well worth the price.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT", "Author": "Melissa Montilla", "ReviewID": "R3R0E34KE58IT3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When i first saw it, i was impressed about how cool this phone really is, after 3 weeks i'm still amazed.

Also forget about using the phone while it's charging with the included charger.  I had to contact the seller because the phone was going crazy and i couldn't make selections.  But I used an old charger of my own and so far so good.  The seller was willing to accept the item back though and responded promptly.  The keyboard is sort of smaller than usual and the speaker phone and playing any type of audio isn't very loud.  Other than that I guess I got my moneys worth.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone minor problem", "Author": "Jerneil Tobias", "ReviewID": "R22RFICRS6E00E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is a great phone the specs on this phone is excellent just one problem I cant find any screen protector for it other than that its a great phone.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "On/Off swith and touch screen issues", "Author": "R.
