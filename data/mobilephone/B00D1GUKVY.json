It does everyything I need it to do with some extras!

One of the things that I liked about it is that it\u2019s a no contract phone. Primarily, I was just looking for a phone for basic voice and text and a little bit of browsing. Secondly, I wanted to play casual games. In reality, I would have been OK with another flip phone. So when I saw this phone, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to upgrade to a smartphone. Getting a data plan was not in my budget.Recently though, I was thinking that having data services might be good. Everything\u2019s available on the web. And if I needed to search for something on the web, I would need a smartphone. To make a long story short, I decided that this phone was the tops and met all my needs.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Andrea Paul", "ReviewID": "R1U2MFD2S10LMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "phone was what was described it works great got it in a reasonable time frame from when it was paid for!", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Completely Satisfied;; just wish it jad swype lol", "Author": "Tiffany Roseblock", "ReviewID": "R138RDKSK7BBI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It arrived in perfect condition, manual, phone, battery and wall charger.
