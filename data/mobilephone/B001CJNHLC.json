{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An excellent phone, for Europe and Asia", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RTZG0QKX6SS9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As other reviewers wrote, this is a Europe/Asia model (the E71-1 RM-346 to be precise). If you want to use it mainly in US you should take a E71-2 (e.g. the US version) so you can use the US 3G. If you need a phone for Europe or Asia, this is a good deal because with the current currency rate it's cheaper here than anything I've seen in Europe.The one I have came from Philippines. The manual is in English and the language can be set either in English or Philippines languages. The AC adapter is the same shape as US/Japan, and it accepts anything from 100V to 230V.There are already a lot of reviews about this product, but here is what I love in it, in a nutshell:* SIP (VOIP) is integrated to the system, so you can very easily initiate a VOIP call (just by typing a number or from your address book). Very convenient to make cheap international call when you're on a WiFi* The battery life is amazing* It's very responsive* It's thin and slim but the keyboard is still very usableThere are a few cons in the software (such as having to switch networks manually) but unless you're really into multimedia (music/videos) it's the best phone out there.", "Date": "October 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "3G network specs", "Author": "zoostar", "ReviewID": "R3UZ4ZUJJHYJKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would like to add to P. Nanda's review.In order to use 3G/UMTS/HSDPA, go for model E71-3 which supports WCDMA 850/2100 HSDPA, since AT&T;/Cingular 3G runs on 850/1900 and T-Mobile 3G will run on 1700/2100. This way you will have both the networks covered.* I do not make any guarantee regarding the 3G specs above. It is based on facts that I have today.", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Understand what EURO stands for", "Author": "Phaduman \"Phal\"", "ReviewID": "R15EM3TWFR3NRH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My colleague ordered and then later had to cancel. Phone is great, but I wanted to add a line about what is available when it means 'EURO'.People look at quad band and think that US is fully supported. Yes, as long as you are on GSM network for voice calls. But for HSDPA/3G data service, you would have to check specifically if US frequencies are supported under HSDPA frequency range.For 3G/HSDPA to work in US/ATT/T-Mobile, the frequency support should be 850MHz/1900MHz under HSDPA category. To make it very easy, I advise going to iphone 'Tech Specs' and see what frequencies it supports under various features and you will be clear. Here is a cut/paste for what works for US:Cellular and wireless (iPhone frequency support list)UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz)GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)Wi-Fi (802.11b/g)Bluetooth 2.0 + EDRThe EURO E71 doesn't have some of the HSDPA frequencies that US requires (850/1900MHz I believe). Hopefuly I didn't make things more confusing.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nokia E71", "Author": "Val \"Monsieur Ego\"", "ReviewID": "RSF5AM0KG9J4H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been cheating on NOKIA in the last 2 years with LG and Palm. I am sorry NOKIA this will never happened again. You know what they say about the cars. Once you own and drive Mercedes that's it there is no other car can satisfy you. Same with NOKIA about phones. There is no more to ask in the phone that E71 can offer you. I guaranty once you open the box that's it you are in love and as soon as you touch it the love become unconditional.  I will tell you what. iPhone, Palm, LG , G1 or  what ever phones look like prehistoric ugly stones compare  to the NOKIA E71. About the functions I have only one world. Symbian OS. The people who's know and looking for good reliable product will know what I am talking about. I am happy and I know I will be happy in the future with the E71 as I was happy with my NOKIA communicator for years. I have no Cons for this phone. If you need more then what this phone can offer, you need to buy a laptop computer and stick it in your ear.  One more thing. The EURO E71 doesn't have some of the HSDPA frequencies that US requires. You need to buy the US model in order to be in 3G networks in USA. Yes US are always behind the mobile technologies.", "Date": "October 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best Phone Ever!", "Author": "M.

I am previous BlackBerry user and liked that interface, which may be why I found the Nokia so vexing to use.Pros: It works well in Africa, England and the US with local SIM cards: Airtel (Africa), WorldSIM (England) and AT&T; (USA, used the GoPhone plan).  So there it gets five stars.  Battery life is stellar, several days before it needs recharging.  Reception is very good in every setting.  I have had no dropped calls and the sound quality was reasonable. The volume adjustment was elusive however, which brings us to the...Cons: The camera is terrible.  In dim lighting the photos have streaks like 1970s-style TV interference. In regular light, the quality is plain low. I took hundreds of photos and ended up deleting them all because none were worth keeping.  In NO setting could it substitute for a camera.Nokia interface is what it is, and I found it cumbersome and at times even painful.  For example, finding the clock takes several screens, and setting up a daily alarm is not an option.  SMS with pictures does not work.  I was never able to set up the mail as I have on my computers and iPad and had to use webmail, which was cumbersome.  The internet did work consistently, but the pages loaded awkwardly and did not fit the screen, thus requiring a scroll back in forth to read.  My greatest grievance is the navigation button, which does not let you scroll smoothly through pages thus greatly increasing the work to get around.Specifically, it requires that you click for each increment in scrolling rather than allowing continuous scroll.  Getting back to the top of a page, for example, can take thirty clicks.  I could go on and on, but in short, it was labor intensive to do basic tasks, so much so that I did not get very far in using advanced tasks.I have to say that I am surprised by such glowing reviews, and three stars feels generous.  BlackBerry and iPhone are far easier to use and with more pleasant interfaces and much better internet capabilities.  If you know and love Nokia, then this phone certainly delivers in terms of being a trouble free phone, but the navigation and internet interface are deal breakers for me.After a fall into water, my Nokia E71 is now defunct, and I am glad to be moving on.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
