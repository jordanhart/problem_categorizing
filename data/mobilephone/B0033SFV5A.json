I needed a Cell phone for emergencies on the road and with a CAMERA for any accidents for proof if available, and being inexpensive!!!  This Camera pleases me greatly!There is no contract, I just pay $15 a month not needing to be renewed monthly as sometimes I am just not able to come up with the funds or am recovering from surgery and do not go anywhere!It certainly fulfills my needs and for others in the same boat as myself. I do not need anything fancy with a lot of features, even though this phone has several!  I am VERY SATISFIED WITH IT!", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Watch Refurbished phone - Could be pre-paid phone", "Author": "Dlock", "ReviewID": "R2MT4GFVN9618P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone as a replacement for another phone.  When it arrived I couldn't activate it with Verizon because it was a PrePaid phone (Not mentioned in the description)  Verizon requires it to be on the prepaid plan for 6 months before activating on a regular account.

So mom gave me this phone on my 16th birthday, and now i'll be 20 next month... I still have the same phone. The same exact one she bought for me four years ago.This phone is ruthless. I drop it on my bedroom floor by accident, on average, twice a week, and it still works the same as it did when I first got it. I even dropped it in a full bucket of water, it sank all the way to the bottom, and it still worked like normal when I dried it off!! It's a rock, I swear.I'm a texter, not a caller, so what I do every month is the unlimited texting plan, $20 a month. Can't receive video, but that's not a big deal to me. I receive pictures and text messages without the hassle of hidden payments.The charger came with the phone, since it was bought at a Verizon store. The calling is pretty clear.I definitely recommend this phone if you're not looking for anything too snazzy. It's a pretty ordinary phone, takes pictures, has big buttons. I'm into the old school Verizon, not much of a touch screen person. It's great!", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Had no idea it was prepaid", "Author": "djseb", "ReviewID": "R3EN1JKLLATMT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had no idea this phone was prepaid and it didnt work for me.
