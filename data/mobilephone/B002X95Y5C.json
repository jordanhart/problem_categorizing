After about 4 months, the screen fuzzed over, and every time i used the lock button, the screen was all jazzy and unreadable. I sent it off to be repaired and got it back in one piece. Then one night I put the phone on my bedside table, and withn an hour, had conked out randomly. After taking it to be fixed, they said that it was waterlogged and couldnt be fixed, even though no liquid had been in contact with the phone. I am now phoneless and stuck on the contract. Overall was fairly good for music, texting was a bit slow, liked the design. Honestly, i liked the phone until it died, but its not just been me who has had many techinical problems with this phone.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia 5800", "Author": "Walter Rodr\u00edguez A", "ReviewID": "R10FRJRGP7RX5G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hi I want to express my experience of my recent purchaseMy phone nokia 5800 does not come with 8 GB memory, which states in itsannouncement that comes with + 8 GB of memory.

I use it for everything now; music, internet, GPS, camera.  And the Nokia Ovi store is getting better applications for the phone.  Some apps do close randomly at times but besides that no major problems. The battery life holds for about 2 days on moderate use and charges fully in 1-2 hours.  Very customizable, especially with the SPB mobile app, well worth the $30 to make your phone look sharper.  Bottom line: This phone is better than the iPhone.  Might not be as pretty but look up the specs and compare.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "phone died in 5 days. 4 and counting attempts by nokia to repair  SAME ISSUE", "Author": "Gowri Somanath \"gs\"", "ReviewID": "R3EK6WE2AHY08U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "phone died in 5 days. 4 and counting attempts by nokia to repair  SAME ISSUEif you find anything wrong. RETURN for REFUND immed if possible.Purhcased at NYC flagship store. I had the phone working for 1st 5 days. When the battery started to discharge, i tried charging. It didnt charge at all. Store gave me new battery saying battery was at fault. Again same issue. It wudnt even turn on with the charger connected - so clearly its not just battery problem. By the time this battery discharged , the 14 day return period was over - pretty sure they knew it.Then started the saga of sending to nokia service center - PALCO. Already sent 4 times. each time had to ship back same evening or next day. Same problem for \"repaired\" \"replaced\" and \"repaired again\" phone.First they claim its \"repaired\", then 2nd time they claim \"cannot be repaired...so replaced\"...why did they send it then?but the so called replaced also had same issue - how can this be co-incidence?again sent...they claim repaired....but same issue.When i call....they dont agree to send me a courtesy phone since its clearly their mistake and 4 attempts are enough to figure out im being cheated.They wont give me refund or replacement.They wont even agree to send me a email saying they take responsibility to resolve the issue.5 is not my lucky number....i have no hope it will get resolved.looks like they will continue playing ping-pong till end of 12 months.WORST set of people.Bottom line: NEVER BUY UNLOCKED PHONES- even if its nokia flagship storeNEVER BUY NOKIARETURN WHEN YOU CAN", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002X95Y5C"}}
