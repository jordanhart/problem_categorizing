{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Impressed", "Author": "BBoesch \"BrennenB\"", "ReviewID": "R2SAMF1FHCWH2K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this watch through amazon a couple of weeks ago and have been pleasantly surprised thus far.  I was a little worried when I ordered this watch that I'd be overwhelmed by the Dick Tracy factor, but was relieved to find out that the watch is not as bulky as I feared.  I'm a medium sized guy with a medium sized wrist and, thankfully, this watch isn't much bigger than my diving watch.  As far as functionality goes, the call quality is excellent.  -Better than my iphone even.  And I simply inserted my AT&T; sim card in it.  This was very surprising and I can't figure out how such a small phone can get such good reception.  Over the past two weeks I've had to charge it about every two days (on average).  Granted, I've only really used it for calls and texting.  -There is no e-mail or internet, which is fine considering the fact that I wouldn't expect to spend much time browsing the web anyway. The specs say that the standby time (i.e., when just using as a watch) is about 10 days or so, which seems about right, although I'd guess closer to a week.  The phone naturally comes with a charger that is easy to use.  -No delicate plug-ins or need to remove an internal battery.  Instead, there is a little charging cradle that fits over the watch and charges through a tiny contact point on the underside.  The interface is simple and easy to use.  The colors are bright and the touchscreen is sensitive.  Texting is about as easy as you could hope for, especially on a relatively small screen, and the predictive text program is impressively accurate.  IAlthough if your a big texter, this watch probably isn't for you).  The watch comes with a bluetooth earpiece, which is a must (unless you want to look like Dick Tracy and have everyone listen to your conversations).  The included earpiece was ok, but I purchased one that I liked better at the AT&T; store.  Lastly, the construction of the watch itelelf appears to be very sturdy.  The case is steel and the face is tempered glass (not plastic).  The band was a little stiff at first, but has loosened up nicely.  Overall, I've been very happy with this product.  It's amazing how far technology has come.  -This is actually the second watch phone that I've owned.  The first one was called \"M-500\" something or other, which was supposedly top of the line a few years back.  The big difference between the two is the overall quality.  The M500 I had looked like it had a steel case, but was actually plastic with a chrome-like finish.  This gave it kind of a cheap feel overall and the user interface was pretty bare bones.  In any event, I don't mean to slam the M500 (I can't even find anything about it on the internet anymore.  I think it was Australian though), but just wanted to point out how far things have come since 2008.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Brilliant if you wear it on the other side of your wrist", "Author": "Bill Liao \"Author of Stone Soup - The secret ...", "ReviewID": "R3ECMXDT5SLRI6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this and its wonderful.Particularly good battery life and if you wear it on the underside of your wrist you can make calls without a headset and it looks like you are holding thin air while making a call.The touch screen is very good as is the music player and the interfaces.I recommend using it with At&t; and Google as they have a very good email to sms and sms to email gateway and brilliant SMS notification system and sms search system respectively.There are no data services on the device, No email, no game, no apps and no browser.It is very god for voice and the speaker phone is excellent. If you must use a headset then get a jawbone to go with it as the headset it comes with is very ordinary.Beware the charging cable though, its connectors are fragile and you only get one cable with a charging clip so if you break it then you are stuck (I have a soldering iron and ended up by passing the connectors because I could not get another clip anywhere.Overall it s brilliant!", "Date": "December 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "WARNING", "Author": "Reuben Keeling", "ReviewID": "R2PM45FRDLSE3K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "BE AWARE I bought one of these from eXpansys and it only appears to have 80 MB of internal memory. On their website, they say this phone has 2 GB of internal memory. I was hoping to use this as an music player as well, but I can only fit around 10 songs on this version - not much use at all.I'm going to try to see what their explanation is.Also, some packs sold by other retailers have a bluetooth headset included - this one does not.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG GD910 Cell Phone Wrist Watch", "Author": "Leon D Hughes", "ReviewID": "RXDITUILYGK8B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the International Version of this watch, which did not come with an english version of the instruction book.... I emailed the company and asked for one and they gladly provided it.  My product also did not come with the bluetooth headset, I guess that's why it only cost me $800.00 vice $1,000.00.  Everything works as advertised and it's a really well made product.  I don't use the cell phone very much because I have an iphone 4 which I love and use often, but I use the LG GD910 as a wrist watch almost everyday.  When I tested out the cell phone function, all I had to do was to remove the sim card from my iphone and insert it into the watch and everything worked great!!!!", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cool Gadget!", "Author": "skyvale", "ReviewID": "R3LX9OVKBBS8A9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife as she always wanted a \"Dick Tracy\" style phone!The LG watchphone is a really stylish looking watch with a cell phone and other apps built in.It is a fairly basic phone without a browser, so if you want to surf the net on your watch you need to look elsewhere.The watch face does display a basic digital readout continuously although it is very dim until you press one of the buttons on the side. The fancy watch faces are only accessible when you activate the phone which is a little disappointing, but it would seem necessary to conserve battery power.It is very easy to use with an intuitive interface, comfortable to wear and has good sound quality from the loudspeaker.One gripe I have is the lack of any Bluetooth device shipping with the GD910. LG could have designed a headset to compliment the watch considering the high asking price for this watchphone!Overall we really like this device as it suits my wife's needs perfectly, giving her a watch and phone/text capabilities without the bulk of a cell phone.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Really Cool Cell Phone Watch", "Author": "J. Myles", "ReviewID": "R3ULC74P6PJFJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LG GD910 is really a cool cell phone, mp3 player, video player, watch, camera, video camera, Wi-Fi device, etc.  It does all the things that is claimed, BUT there are a few problems:  First, the headset is very fragil and will break at the point it goes into the watch and it does not fit snuggly into the watch.  Also the headset is made for someone with short arms. If you are under 5'9\" or have a 32\" sleeve length, it may be more comfortable to wear.  Second, the cell phone does not work very well with all bluetooth devices.  It has excellent volumn with with Philips, Motorola and Jabra, but low volumn with Emerson and N9 stylus models. Third, the watch face on the box in the ads is not the watch face that is actually on the watch.  Forth, the Voice Response system was not done by someone who fully understands English.  Fifth, the Contact list should be revived to remove Mobile from being the default selection. Other then those irritation, the cell phone watch is a lot of fun.  Remember, VERIZON does not like to allow phones that use SIM cards on their network.  Nearly all other service can provide a SIM card and activate your phone instantly.  Consumer Cellular will send you an activated SIM card in the mail for this phone.  Back to the phone.  It is quite a fancy device that should bring a lot of fun and lots of conversation about the cell phone.", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Touchscreen\nWatchphone\nTriband\nGSM\nMP3", "Name": "LG GD910 Unlocked Cell Phone with VGA Camera, Bluetooth with A2DP, GSM, MP3/WMA/AAC Player--International Version with Warranty (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FcHxrXuKL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002ZSDJZ8"}}
