After I received it, it's totally different from the pictures posted on Amazon web site - no Apple box and accessories but there was a scratch paper with a telephone number on it. I called that number to make sure the phone is a new phone - I only concern about the battery, box and accessories are not big deal. The guy who answered my call told me it is a brand new phone, to save costs they tossed the box. Okay that's fine, understandable. So I took the phone to Sprint to have it activated but I was told that the phone is a refurbished one. Here's my point - I don't mind it's an used or refurbished phone as long as I knew it, but if you tell me it's a brand new one while selling me something different, that's cheating.

This was the only reason I bought from the seller in the first place.  The item did arrive promptly on date estimated, however, the iphone was in a ziplock bag and the charger and headphones were in a separate ziploc bag.  I instantly felt disappointed and duped because I no longer believed it was brand new.  At least the iphone was not scratched and appeared in good condition.  When we turned it on it seemed to have some charge still (unlike a brand new item) and it seemed to work.  We are keeping our fingers crossed that there is nothing wrong with it.  I will not be buying from ATechStore again due to false advertisement. I now noticed that there was a different reviewer that had a problem with their purchased iphone from this same seller having a stored e-mail which made the iphone also seem not brand new.

All of which showed significant depreciation of usuability after just a few months of use i.e. Battery Life and Operaability.  By operability I mean, some had over-heating issues with playing games, general lag in loading times, depreciated service reception, and laggy less responsive touch screen displays.So I tried out the Iphone through much resistance, and have had the phone for about 6 months now and still love it.  The quality of the phone far surpases all of the android phones I have owned, the thick glass is fairly scratch resistant, unlike the HTC phones with softer screens easily prone to scratches just by whipping with a micro-fiber cloth.This phone has yet to do anything but run aps I download very smoothly (including games), I never have any latency in the touch screen, and my service is always amazing (Sprint).  The battery life of the phone is nothing short of amazing, especially given the fact that I am CONSTANTLY on my phone fiddling around, I have no issues with the battery not lasting all day before a recharge generally more than 12 hours at work.Obviously if you are prone to dropping your phone you will NEED a case, and I usually go with screen protectors as well just to increase the lifespan.In conclusion, if you can adapt to iTunes, and learning the new iOS, you will think this phone is nothing short of amazing and you will be begging for the new iPhone 5 when it comes out.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "I am sad", "Author": "alex", "ReviewID": "R1PXP7M87SLFMH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't know what to do beacause I can't find a sim slot on this phone,does it work with calling card ?", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome price!", "Author": "Lockleg", "ReviewID": "R1G7828F432MUC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Came as promised.
