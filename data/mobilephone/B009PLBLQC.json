In the past, I owned BIG SCREEN PHONES as Galaxy Note (with 5.3\" screen, too heavy and too big) and wanted something smaller that I could hold in one hand comfortably. Since I am a true techie, I researched this phone for all specs as soon as it was released on several websites. Since this phone has EXCEEDED all of my expectations, here is my very detailed review of this very special and fun to use Mini S3 phone. My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.Update 8/24/13 - Just received today, the newest firmware/OS for the 4.1.2 OTA (on my phone directly) as it was updated from Samsung and this is very new at this date of Monday, August 5, 2013 and arrived in my phone's Notification area today. After the upgrade completed, I noticed at once that this phone is lightning fast and the touchscreen is very, very fast and responsive! This is the THIRD update that I received since I purchased this phone in April 2013. Each update is not that large, however, it enhances the performance of this phone. Very encouraged as if the updates keep coming regularly, perhaps4.2.2 will be coming to the S3 Mini. And from my research, it is possible that the S3 Mini may receive the 4.2 OS but it will be a while longer...Till then, I shall keep on trying to update and keep you informed...PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me as it fits easily into my jeans pocket or smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out.- STANDARD SIZED SIM CARD: The S3 Mini has a standard Sim card slot (unlike the full sized S3 that has a micro Sim slot). Good to know as I did not have to cut my Sim card, I just placed it into the S3 Mini and I was good to go, and I did not have to set up the APN settings for Internet and MMS as the setup did this for me automatically). This is good to know if you want to use your regular Sim card and not have to deal with settings yourself. What a great feature.- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and the signal strength is excellent even when I am far from my router. And when not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T; for data and easily get 3G and found the data to be very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser).- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery.  What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4.75GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: I downloaded a FREE APP called Kingsoft Office which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.- CAMERA - The 5MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. And it compared to the picture quality I had with my Samsung Galaxy Note with 8MP camera, so what a happy surprise! Turns out to be a pretty good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...- Very small instruction \"manual\" provided with the tablet, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal.-- International Phone so NO US WARRANTY. Not a problem for me because I have learned over time that if a device is going to fail, it usually does it within the first 30 days. This phone has been great--no problems at all!-- No NFC except on the model with the N on the model number. I do not use NFC so I have no problem with that.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from the BIG S3, want just the most important features, want a smaller and more lightweight phone that will do all the basic things of a Smartphone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it! (english/spanish review)", "Author": "Max!", "ReviewID": "R1UT94WI39XLDX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi guys,I must admit that I when I purchased this mobile, I was a little afraid. I had read lots of reviews and watched some videos on YouTube before the purchase. Anyway, I was worried mainly because of the screen resolution (480 x 800, that means no HD), the battery life and the size of the screen.I can tell you, this mobile is just awesome! It comes with Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean installed, which is so beautiful and fluid. The screen is great, battery life is very good and the size of the screen is, in my opinion, perfect. I've never considered the \"regular\" Samsung Galaxy S3 because it is way to big for me. I wanted something quite small (although the screen is bigger than an iPod touch 4th gen), responsible, attractive and efective. This mobile is excellent for me! :-).The mobile accept 3G, it has smart stay, and all those \"high-tech\" features like his bigger brother the S3.I will reply any question you might have about this device and update this review next saturday.SPANISH:Hola! Debo decirles que antes de comprar este tel\u00e9fono tenia un poco de miedo con respecto a la pantalla, ya sea al tama\u00f1o como a la resolucion de la misma (no es HD). Tambien estaba desconfiando un poco por las reviews que le\u00ed y videos que vi, sobre la duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda. Sinceramente el telefono me ENCANTA, yo vivo en Argentina y funciona perfectamente con las redes de ac\u00e1. La pantalla es realmente muy muy buena, todo se ve fluido y es incre\u00edble. El tama\u00f1o tambien es muy bueno, en mi opinion es el tama\u00f1o perfecto, ya que un Galaxy S3 de los comunes me parece excesivamente grande.El telefono viene con Android 4.1.1 y apenas lo compr\u00e9 se me actualizaron unos paquetes (pero sin cambiar de versi\u00f3n). Para los que pasen de un celular con Android 2.2 o 2.3, les puedo asegurar que estamos hablando de dos cosas totalmente distintas. Les cuento que lo que avanz\u00f3 este sistema operativo durante los ultimos meses es impresionante.En cuanto a la c\u00e1mara y a la bater\u00eda, no tuve mucho tiempo de evaluarlos muy a fondo (durante estos d\u00edas voy a subir un update de mi review sobre estos temas), pero incluso usando un fondo de pantalla de los din\u00e1micos (live wallpaper) la bater\u00eda ha durado todo un d\u00eda.Con respecto al tel\u00e9fono en general, anda perfecto sin ning\u00fan problema. Todo es muy fluido y no hay ning\u00fan tipo de lag.Cualquier duda que tengan no duden en preguntarme, les contestar\u00e9 lo antes posible.Saludos!", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Confessions of an iPhone user", "Author": "Russell Ericksen", "ReviewID": "R1TE5APFEB0IZJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In summary: Good phone if you come with midrange expectations, hopefully Samsung will include better specs next time around.Recently my iPhone didn't just crack, it shattered the very first time I dropped it. I've never been opposed to trying an android phone, just didn't want to commit 2 years and a large sum of money to something I could potentially hate, in addition I'm not interested in phones that are approaching the size of my face.  In short I've been quite impressed and the transition was simple as pie. This is not a competitor of the iPhone 5, the specs are just not there, this is a competitor of the iPhone 4S, so I will articulate the differences. At the time of writing this, the Galaxy S3 mini is a full $200+ cheaper (around 40% cheaper) than the iPhone 4S yet I feel nearly comparable in quality.Physical Size: The Galaxy S3 mini is nearly the same size as the iPhone 4S, minimally larger, even though it has a 4 inch screen vs. the iPhone 4S 3.5 inch. In fact, it's so similar, the Glaxy S3 mini fits into the phone sleeve I bought for the iPhone. I have medium sized hands (like, literally, I work in a lab and wear size medium latex gloves), and I think this is the perfect size, my thumb barely reaches the top left corner while still holding the phone securely (i.e. with the first knuckle of my other fingers). I hope they keep future models in the 4\" (max 4.2\") range, a 5\" is just not necessary or comfortable to walk around with in your pocket.Display: Again, 4 inch display vs. 3.5 inch on iPhone 4s, though there are less pixels (480x800 vs 640x960, respectively, 38% less). You can look at this two ways, because you have a 4\" screen, you \"get\" to hold it farther away, or because of the lower pixel density, you \"have\" to hold it farther away (without noticing the pixels). This just means you just don't get the same clarity if you want to examine something closely. That said, all you have to do is watch the video included in the Gallery of the phone to be wow'ed by the screen, the colors do pop and it looks very nice. Just when you are reading text, the pixels are noticeable, especially if you are accustomed to a \"retina\" screen.Responsiveness: iPhone users will know the responsiveness of the screen, when you move your finger it looks like you are pushing a coin across the table. On the Galaxy S3 mini, there is a tiny bit of delay, this is more noticeable when moving the finger fast. In addition, there can be some stuttering of the screen if it is processing/downloading something else. These don't detract much from the phone but hope are improved in the next generation.Transition: First of all, I would highly suggest SmoothSync (contacts + calendars). I have all my contacts and calendars set up in iCloud and this software brings them to the Galaxy S3 mini in minutes, turned a potential nightmare into a dream. Next, the above said, there are some features, both physical- and software-based, that make up for the limitations. It has NFC capabilities, you just have to buy a NFC SIM card from your provider, which may be the source of some confusion, there also appears to be talk of a version without NFC though the once I received does have it. They have not set up NFC with my local transportation system yet, so I haven't spent the $30 on the SIM card, will update if/when I do. There is a micro SD slot, so you can chose how much extra memory you want up to 32GB (the phone says 8GB but when I first started it had about 4.5GB free), if you need more room, you can easily expand which is not the case for the iPhone. For the software, it's small but the live wallpaper looks really cool and I think makes up for the lack of pixel density. You can turn off/on GPS/Wifi/Bluetooth, etc. very quickly, just swipe down from the top and tap the icon. I like having \"widgets\" such as the music player right among the app icons, instead of having to open the app to play music, as well as a number of other small things. Software interaction is pretty similar, just have to get used to using the \"back\" and \"menu\" keys in addition to the home button.In case anyone was wondering, yes this does work for me in Singapore on the M1 network.So, again, overall happy with the phone, I will likely upgrade in about a year when I don't have to pay a recontracting fee. I will keep an eye on this line and hope they make some changes in the next version. I feel like this is a trial balloon...they are testing to see customers are interested in \"smaller\" (still 4-4.2\" screen), which I definitely am. Some things that could be/I hope are improved:-Screen: Should be at least in the 600x1024 range, at 4 inches, this brings the pixel density close to 300ppi (like that of the 'full size' galaxy s3).-Processor: Bump up the engine to address the minor lag issues.-LTE: I mean, by next year it should be a pretty standard thing to include on phones.These are straightforward improvements that are already included on the 'full size' Galaxy S3, and would make this baby brother highly desirable to a wide range of people.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dissatisfied", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R2INRRI76BIU4F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just got this phone on Friday. 9/27 (finally arived) and today is 9/29 . words cannot express how excited I was to re I've this phone. It even arrived early! Got off work and sure enough there was a neat it the package sitting there for me. Opened it up and started playing with it.. Got. My service all set up.. Good.. THEN came the sadness. I love the phone itself... Just not the company that sells it on Amazon. (universal GSM mobile) in a nutshell, this company's short sightedness and general disregard for customers satisfaction is a huge issue. This company had the audacity to include a defective battery. And when I say defective, I mean it in a very blantent and obvious way. It does NOT hold a charge. It litterally loses about 1% power every minute. Its been on thee charger all night.. And after DE - charging (still plugged in mind you) to about 43% it's total percent is at a total of 68%. Which is after being on the charger all day YESTERDAY as well. Did I mention the phone won't stay off? I'll try to turn it off for the night just to give the charge more priority.... But it flips itself right back on! It even randomly resets itself in the middle of general tasks. Love it. The thing that bothers me the most... THEY KNEW IT WAS BAD! How do I know? Well.. They took it upon themselves to remove the little water damage stickers just leaving an empty little box. The fact that the firmware is also outdated any CAN NOT be updated without kies or flashing seems minor compared to this. Oh and you can forget about Samsung helping you out. They don't provide services to these phones since they are \"international models\". .. I've sent a complaint to the company to see if I can resolve this issue... But I'm not holding my breath. 240$ for a defective product. And another 30$ to MAYBE fix the problem. Cuz.. You know.. I love spending money I don't have. Buy at your own risk.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what I needed!", "Author": "Len", "ReviewID": "R2S5FHTMZKLW5S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For starters, the phone does come fully unlocked when you buy it, brand new packaging and all. I received it quite fast and in great condition. It's 3G and wifi capable. Coverage varies on your service. I have Tmobile so it's not terrific, but suits me well when I need it. Besides the phone, the box comes with a USB adapter, ear phones (which I might add are surprisingly nice quality earphones), and the charger. It also comes with ear phone comforter replacements in different sizes for different sized ears which is a nice addition.Build (4/5):  The phone is lightweight and thin, but has a good feel to it. I'm currently using a rubberized protective case which has worked beautifully, but I have to say I'm sure that the back cover would come off from a hard fall. The backing is a thin flexible plastic which made me feel uncomfortable with drops, so that's why I bought a case. The screen is like any other phone screen that probably scratches easily without a screen cover (I have that too). It's not Gorilla Glass like its older brother, but it holds up just fine if you take good care of it. The size of the screen itself is fantastic. You're buying the mini, remember that, so the screen is obviously smaller, but don't be fooled. In this case, smaller is better. The original S3 has an absurdly large screen in my opinion, which is a bit unnecessary (don't even get me started on the galaxy Note). For all original S3 users, I challenge you to hold the phone in your right hand comfortably. And try to touch the top left corner of your screen. Failed? The mini makes this possible allowing full coverage of the screen by your thumb in a single hand grip. I found this very nice to navigate through menus, apps, maps, etc. I love the size, and it also fits into a jean pocket much better. Overall, nice feel, thin and stylish design, just take care of it and it won't be a problem.Display and Camera (4/5): the only thing keeping this from being 5/5 is the front camera. Only at VGA quality, it's grainy, a bit slow, and bad in any lighting that's not bright enough to read in. But now on to the reason it's 4/5. The super AMOLED screen is beautiful for such a small phone and for the price. Again, It's not as vibrant and vivid as its older brother, but you're paying for a mini, so you're getting a mini display of it. At full brightness, you couldn't tell the difference (in my opinion, my friend has the S3). Unfortunately only reaching 720p, the display still is great for videos, games, and beautiful wallpapers. There is no auto brightness function, so you'll be finding yourself constantly adjusting the brightness in the pull down menu. I didn't mind this at all as it saves battery in the way that its not constantly adjusting itself. Plus I liked putting it to just the right brightness depending on the lighting I was in. The screen is just right for me and i love the look, and have even comfortably watched 2 full length movies on it. The back camera is only 5mp compared to other camera with 8mp. The 5mp does just fine at capturing video and decent pictures in good light. Low lighting is taken care of by the LED flash. The back camera is good enough for the price and has been good enough in all the situations I have been in. Bright camera and beautiful screen. Simple as that.Performance (5/5): The phone performance itself gets 5/5 because I knew going into it that it does not have the processing power of the original S3. With 1GB of ram, and Jelly Bean4.0 running out of the box, the UI is smooth, crisp, and easy to use. The phone runs 720p videos with ease if you have a good wifi connection or good 3G coverage. Games will run fine, but the bigger the game, the longer the loading times will be, and the frame rate will drop a bit every now and then but what do you expect from such a small phone running a giant game? The 8GB of space will do justice for the average phone user. If you're an app junky, there is a micro SD slot for more space as you definitely will be needing it. I have a few games and productivity apps, and the 8GB does me just fine. However, it is true that when you get the phone, all the basic stuff that's already on the phone leaves you with about 4GB of free space. But this problem is minuscule, as you're more than welcome to expand the space yourself. Smooth performance, great for casual usage. Allows app junkys to add breathing room. Perfect.Extras [Battery, sound quality, buttons, etc] (3/5): The aspect that accounts for most of those three stars is the sound quality. For such a small phone, I didn't expect much for playing music and what not. I was wrong. The sound quality on this phone is unbelievable. At its loudest, you might think its hooked up to a small speaker. The bass is clear and all types of music sound beautiful on it. Call quality is also fantastic, and when you put people on speaker, it has a boost option that makes it easier. The sound on its own is 5/5. The home, power, and volume rocker buttons aren't something to rave about. I found myself having to press the home button a bit more firmly that I wanted to at times, and sometimes I'd apparently press too far away from the middle of the wide button and wld have to press it again. The volume rocker is fine, but the power button seems to be a bit too sensitive at times. When I pressed it to unlock/lock it, the option to power off came up some times but that's only not picking (2/5). The battery lasts a full stretch day (lasts you into the night) with casual use. If you're on it 24/7, you'll pay for it in battery life. I suggest downloading JuiceDefender as it did a superb job at making the battery last 2 days with casual use. I keep power saver mode on and brightness on medium low, so anything above that I'm not so sure how it will fair. But it did just fine for me (4/5). Web browsing is also simple and easy. Nothing different than browsing on an iPhone 5 despite the text clarity on a retina display. Probably not comfortable to be on it all day to surf the net, but for the temporary search-up and news article, it works just fine (5/5). Another big let down for all non iCustomers is the App Store. A small trinket store compared to the massive mall of the apple App Store.  But it had all the apps I wanted, but this varies from person to person (3/5).Overall 4 out of 5 stars because its exactly what I wanted and expected when I bought this phone. A little more than expected actually, as I doubted the screen resolution and performance considering the lowered specs. However, this phone is the little engine that could and then some. Does everything you want a smart phone to do in style. Light weight, fun to use, and a perfect phone for someone like me who thinks the S3 original is too damn big! Besides a disgraceful VGA front facing camera, there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't get this phone if you're looking for a cheaper, smaller S3 or smart phone in general.

I don't need my phone to be anything more than a phone I can connect to the internet with as needed, as it isn't my primary device for web activities.  Needless to say the phone is great.  It's not an S3 but that's not what I wanted or needed.  The phone has a great aesthetic.  It very slim and the curves are pleasing. The phone is light in the hand but also feels well put together. I don't have huge hands so the phone fits in my hand.  The call quality is what I have to come expect living in the city, which is pretty good quality as long as I am not underground or in a building.  The TouchWiz interface by Samsung works and doesn't feel like it is cheapening my Android experience. I chose to use StraightTalk as my phone service and the phone play s fine with the service as an ATT phone. Also, I accidentally ordered a microsim as opposed to a regular sim card  and the slim fits in my phone just fine.  Can't say others will but my microsim from Straight talk works no issues. A friend had an extra regular sim he put in my phone that we had a hard time removing.  So far a great phone and I will update if anything changes.  Also, buy a protective case.

I prefer a phone-sized phone, since I already have a tablet. This isn't the latest tech, so the price was much more reasonable. The size if good for my hand. Android 4.1.2 came on the phone, and it runs what apps I need on my phone.The phone was unlocked, as described. I dropped in my SIM and the phone logged into the network as soon as it got a signal. It picked up my WiFi signal even faster (no surprise there; T-Mo has a bad signal in this part of town). Reception isn't as good as with my old-school Razr v3, but I was expecting that, and I don't use the mobile a lot in the house. I am able to use this phone for WiFi calling via Talkatone.Very pleased to see that the OS supports turning OFF mobile data usage while keeping regular phone calls/texts active, with or without WiFi being on.The screen is gorgeous. Colors are bright and clear, and text is easy to read.The stock keyboard has keys a bit small for me -- always getting O when I want I and vice versa -- but the Swype keyboard works just fine.After I logged into my Google account from the phone, it quickly pulled in my contacts and photos. I was able to download apps from the Play Store that I had previously purchased for my tablet or music player.iSyncr does a great job of syncing music between the phone and my Mac-based iTunes library, transferring playlists & music to the phone, and playcounts to the Mac, via USB or WiFi. The WiFi transfer rate seems faster on my phone than on the Galaxy 4 player. Possibly the difference between Gingerbread and Jelly Bean? A better WiFi transceiver?I'm sorry to see that so many phones have the microSD slot buried under the battery, forcing me to power down the phone to change the card. The SIM is out in the clear, and I'll need to swap that a LOT less than I might the SD card. It's less of an issue with this phone than it would be with a tablet or music player -- I don't plan to watch video on the phone; that's why I have a tablet, and I can swap cards easily on that -- but it still strikes me as a design mistake.Overall, though, I'm very happy with the vendor and the phone right now. If that changes over time -- I don't expect it to, but you never know -- I'll revisit this review. For now, I'll say it's a nice blend of convenient size and utility, in an attractive package. If you want a \"normal\" sized phone and don't need bleeding edge tech, this is well worth considering.", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not recommended, especially in USA, several problems", "Author": "KBW \"KBW\"", "ReviewID": "R3OF2CUERXVAWD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone based on price and product & seller ratings but although it has some great features and capabilities, I unfortunately had to return it after discovering several issues while using it for almost a month.

It is an unlocked T-Mobile phone but as for GSM, that's only technically correct.  It worked with a contract AT&T; SIM card and a pre-paid T-Mobile GSM SIM card but they only allow EDGE.

This one came with the French language on it and a power outlet connection for another country. After putzing around with it I got it to work OK and charged it through the USB cable. However, that is only on the computer or with a US Samsung adaptor on an outlet. The voltage is different in other countries, so you can't charge it on a car charger port (although you can charge it if you have a USB port in your car). After 5 months, the phone gave a message that the battery will not take a charge. I brought it to a cell phone repair shop and they placed a larger Samsung battery in the power slots of the phone to turn it on. That reset the phone charger, so it took a charge again with the battery. The guy told me that the phone charger is probably shot and it would cost $80 to repair. I took it home to try my luck again. However, after 3 weeks I had the same problem. There is no warranty with this phone and Amazon can't help after a couple months. I contacted Samsung and they said they can't help because it was with Samsung Africa. They gave me a number to call in Africa. No joke. I didn't bother. I sold the phone for a loss, and purchased a regular Galaxy s3. If you look around, you can get a new one for the same price as this or cheaper and with low cost, no contract cell phone plans (Wal Mart Family Mobile, Straight Talk, Virgin Mobile, etc.) Plus the Galaxy s3 is far superior to the mini and much more reliable. The faster processor, gorilla glass, 16gb memory, 4g capability and other features just make it a better phone. It is much easier to use and parts are more commercially available.

In the past, I owned BIG SCREEN PHONES as Galaxy Note (with 5.3\" screen, too heavy and too big) and wanted something smaller that I could hold in one hand comfortably. Since I am a true techie, I researched this phone for all specs as soon as it was released on several websites. Since this phone has EXCEEDED all of my expectations, here is my very detailed review of this very special and fun to use Mini S3 phone. My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me as it fits easily into my jeans pocket or smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out.- STANDARD SIZED SIM CARD: The S3 Mini has a standard Sim card slot (unlike the full sized S3 that has a micro Sim slot). Good to know as I did not have to cut my Sim card, I just placed it into the S3 Mini and I was good to go, and I did not have to set up the APN settings for Internet and MMS as the setup did this for me automatically). This is good to know if you want to use your regular Sim card and not have to deal with settings yourself. What a great feature.- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and the signal strength is excellent even when I am far from my router. And when not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T; for data and easily get 3G and found the data to be very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser).- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4.75GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: I downloaded a FREE APP called Kingsoft Office which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.- CAMERA - The 5MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. And it compared to the picture quality I had with my Samsung Galaxy Note with 8MP camera, so what a happy surprise! Turns out to be a pretty good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...- Very small instruction \"manual\" provided with the tablet, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal.-- International Phone so NO US WARRANTY. Not a problem for me because I have learned over time that if a device is going to fail, it usually does it within the first 30 days. This phone has been great--no problems at all!-- No NFC except on the model with the N on the model number. I do not use NFC so I have no problem with that.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from the BIG S3, want just the most important features, want a smaller and more lightweight phone that will do all the basic things of a Smartphone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love my phone but do your research; this phone is not sold in US so there are some initial quirks", "Author": "Jever", "ReviewID": "R7PKWXKRALD4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 1st smart phone so I have nothing to compare it to but after having it for a month, I have no complaints and still really like it.  I am in US and used the phone for a short time with Tmobiles prepaid plan and now use it with their new Simple Choice plan that has no contract.  It worked well with both plans.I read plenty of reviews before my purchase and am glad I did as it prepared me for the phone being received with French as the main language.  It only took 5 minutes with my laptop and Google translator and I had the phone changed to English.  I also had to change other settings like temperature from C to F but it wasn't a big deal to me maybe b/c it was expected.  Plus, you can find an English manual online.  Just go to Samsung website or google i8190 manual. (The french one it came with was only the short version anyway.)Something I didn't think of was the plug in charger being international too.  Luckily the phone came with an adaptor.  I don't know if all the shippers do this.  I had it shipped from Worldwide Distributors.  I was concerned when I received the phone b/c I noticed that while the safety seal on the product box was intact, there was another underneath it that had been previously opened.  I thought maybe I had received a refurbished phone but when I emailed them, they replied right away and let me know that being an international phone, it would've been opened by Customs and resealed when it came to the US.  They said I could confirm the info with Samsung by providing my serial# but I didn't go that far.I think the phone is easy to use and I like the 4.1.2 operating system.  It has some nice updates that my sister's Gingerbread phone doesn't have.  And I like the size much better than the huge phones that seem so popular now.Call quality seems good.  I can hear callers OK and they can hear me.  I do wish the volume could go just a little higher at times like when I'm using the speaker option in the car w/ a lot of road noise, but overall it's OK.  Volume is fine when I use my headset.  Also at 1st my Mom had trouble hearing me on speaker, but now I remove the gel cover when I talk on speaker and haven't had any issues since.  (No one else complained)Regarding comments that phone is not 8GB....it is.  The android OS and apps added to phone before purchased eat up alot of GB...mine had just over 4GB available when I got it which is enough for me.  You can add an SD card for more space too.Hope my comments help!", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for an American woman", "Author": "Bossladie \"b0ssladie\"", "ReviewID": "R3OE3EKCM1RN22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a phone to replace my Blackberry Torch, which was unlocked and able to receive any GSM Sim card. I based my purchase on the Amazon reviews of this phone. I too have jumped on the 5 star bandwagon. My phone came with French setup, but the seller was kind enough to include typed instructions on how to change the language, and setup for ATT carrier, which I have at the moment. That worked out. People comment positively on my phone, because it's not the clunky regular Galaxy version, and the color is neither white nor black. I love to be different!  The phone is thin and light enough to fit anywhere. It's convenient touch screen has beautiful colors. The features are simple enough to figure out without use of the international language manual, which is useless for an English-only speaker. ATT advised that the phone based on its IMEI number is actually a LTE 4G phone, which is the new technology the USA is transitioning to.Awesome!", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "I AM A FAN", "Author": "Lady Pink", "ReviewID": "R1HHEOWGHW5QPD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first official Android phone outside of the Blackberry Curve and I love it! For a short time I switched over to the cheapest Wal-Mart brand Go Phone possible to save on money and well you get what you pay for. I have had this phone for about a week and I must say it is a breath of fresh air. I am able to do everything that I wanted...I've downloaded about 5 apps so far from Google Apps. I have taken about 10 pictures.......all FANTASTIC. I haven't taken off the factory screen protector yet until my screen protectors arrive in the mail.I read other reviews, took advice given and will say that with everything turned off (Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth) my battery still does not last throughout the entire day. This is coming from someone who sits in front of a computer all day in a cubicle so no I have not been searching the internet on my phone or making phone calls during the daytime. This is the only reason I am giving it 4 stars BUT I am going to count it towards the possibility that maybe it is the battery. I have purchased two sets of batteries (Amazon Product: Onite 2x 1700mAh Li-ion Battery for Samsung I8190 Galaxy S3 / S III mini,Samsung Galaxy S Duos S7562 / Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 I8160, with Charger) in hopes to balance this issue out. In other reviews I learned that one drop can shatter the screen so it was a no-brainer to purchase a cell phone case that could provide protection (Amazon Product: HHI Flip Wallet Case with Stand for Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini - Gray (Package include a HandHelditems Sketch Stylus Pen).The phone is what you make of it and the possibilities are endless. By the way, I have no speed issues. I am currently on AT&T; $65 Smartphone Monthly Plan with 1GB Data I am loving it so far but will more than likely switch to Alltel as the signal is not that great in my home where I do the majority of my texting.

I don't think you will find a better phone for the price, it's ready for international SIM cards.  Android is fantastic, the screen and the colors are stunning.  My only issue is battery life, but a full charge will last you all day as long as you're not playing games all day.After extensive research looking for a new smart phone to replace the iPhone 4 that I lost, I decided to go with the S3 mini and I'm glad I did.  I live in Europe, so factory unlocking was a must, and this phone worked perfectly.  Just popped in the Italian SIM card and I was off to the races.  Price was a big issue for me.  I wanted a good phone but I didn't want to break the bank.  When I got the phone, I was pleased with just about everything except for the battery life.  The slim, rounded design makes it slip in and out of my pocket very easily even with a case, which was a problem when I had my case on my iPhone.  The screen and the colors are extremely vivid and smooth, this is probably what I was most impressed with.  The camera is not quite on par with my old iPhone camera, but I do trust it to take decent pictures in a bind.  Camera quality was not a part of my selection criteria.  The Android operating system, in my opinion, is way more customizable and versatile than iOS for the iPhone. The freedom to customize and the ability to accept third party apps really opens up the capabilities of this phone.  Also, I can plug my phone into my computer and transfer files to and from like I would with a USB.  With the iPhone I had to sync it with iTunes and use iTunes as the intermediary between me and the phone.  I never realized how inconvenient that was until I plugged this phone in and was able to transfer music and photos in an instant!The Cons: Processor speed, battery life, and storage space.  With only 800 MB of RAM, I've noticed that the processor can be bogged down if I'm running too many apps, looking at multiple (4 or more) webpages at once, or doing other intensive things.  However, 95% of the time I don't notice it, and now I simply manage my browsing habits and app habits to make sure I don't overload the processor.  With regard to the battery life, I find I have to plug in the phone every night - the charge won't last for more than a day and a half.  I could usually get a few days out of my iPhone if I wasn't using it much.  If I use the S3 for games, browsing, etc, the battery drains pretty quick.  If I closely manage my wifi, GPS, and mobile data settings to conserve battery life I find I can get two days out of the phone.  Lastly, the phone only has 8GB of internal memory, of which about 3GB were taken by the operating system.  Went to the store though and found a 16 GB mini-SD card on sale for $15, plugged it in,  and voila, now I have 21 GB of usable storage space - more than enough.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "item not as described", "Author": "A.

I have not been impressed with the size of the modern smartphones over the past several years because they have been increasing in size, and I am unsure why we have decided that after years of bricks being the only thing you could get in a cell phone, we want to go back to carrying bricks as cell phones.  Once you add a Ballistic or Otterbox hybrid case to most cell phones, they really do not fit into a pocket anymore.  Enter the Mini line of Galaxy smart phones.  They are very easily stashed in a pocket, held in a hand, and operate with all the newest bells and whistles without carrying a brick.  I went S III Mini over S 4 Mini because there is no point to overbuying Android tech, and next year, once the price on the S 4 Mini has plummeted in the wake of the S 5, I will simply upgrade.

The issue is that it is a GSM phone and will work well as a phone and EDGE. For data these models do not support the frequencies requires for 3G 850/1900 it has 900/1900. You will only get EDGE rates and for a smartphone that is unacceptable this why I took off two stars. it will work fine just slow away from WIFI.

I have heard that the Galaxy S4 is really good with so many features; however it is bigger and requires a contract. Being pragmatic as I am with a budget in mind for a phone, I came across this phone while searching at Amazon. I'm a Prime member and thus, am qualified for a 6 month 0 interest financing. The pebble blue SIII mini is really good and still has many features as a phone. I bought this phone from Worldwide Distributors (very good) and the phone (Android 4.1.2) arrived earlier than the target delivery date. The phone has a French language manual (European model). Being familiar with Android phones and tablets, it was easier for me to browse through the settings and change the language setting in English (US). I have disabled the apps that I don't use and battery life is very satisfactory. I like the 4 inch screen and it's perfect for my hand. I bought the CIMO black case cover and the color blended perfectly with the pebble blue. The CIMO cover really surprised me and it fits perfectly on the phone.I would highly recommend this Samsung Galaxy SIII mini to those people who will use it primarily as a phone.

Something I didn't have on previous \"Smartphones\". I love the size and weight, especially compared to the Blackberry, the screen is crystal clear. Battery seems to perform well. I do advise getting a gel case for it immediately I don't know how much \"abuse\" this one can take. It doesn't feel cheap, but it appears it would be realatively delicate. If you bounce your phone off the wall daily, this one probably is not for you. So far, so good for me. I ordered a  gel case when I ordered the phone only to find out later it was being sent from Hong Kong. Buyer beware. I don't know how you are supposed to know that when you place your order. I couldn't figure a rhyme or reason to it and only found out when I \"tracked\" the order.  Oh well, it will be here by the 4th of July and I will certainly celebrate.(Great phone!)", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "MUN76161 MARIA BLANCO", "ReviewID": "R23HCYV7S8IYY2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone, very good price, right size , came well wrapped and protected .

Now I'm an even bigger fan of Samsung!I've had several Samsung phones over the years.  Most of them fell short.  But Samsung has gotten their act together and no longer competes with Apple, but instead, blows them out of the water!This phone's display was larger and much better than my iphone, though the phone itself is the same size - which is something I like! It's also lighter than an iphone.  And, since we're on the subject, I prefer the sleeker more rounded style of the Samsung. I also like the fact that you can upgrade (inexpensively) the memory.  It comes with 8GB, but I bought a 32 GB micro SD card for $20, and I now have a 40GB phone! One last comparison... The price! This is soooo much cheaper than an unlocked iphone.This phone is smaller than the regular Galaxy S III (hence, \"mini\").  But still packs amazing features. It used a regular mini SIM card (not a micro SIM), and has a MicroSD slot inside (up to 32GB).The ease of use is wonderful and the style is great.I liked this phone so much, that after only 2 weeks of owning it, I bought one for my wife! (And she loves her's too!)FYI - This phone is an international phone. It came with a European charger, but had an American adapter.  You can also charge it via USB (included).  My two phones both were in a foreign language when first starting - One in French, the other in German. However the first thing in the set-up process was to choose a language. Very easy! I did have to get into settings to change from a 24-hour format to a 12-hour format, and change Celsius to Fahrenheit - both were very easy to do in \"Settings\".This phone is unlocked and will work with GSM carriers (AT&T;, T-Mobile, etc... Not Verizon). I bought ours to use with Straight Talk. Easy set-up, easy access, GREAT PHONE!I just took a vacation and had no internet service... That is until I used this phone as a secure hotspot. The benefits keep adding up!Since this is not the regular Galaxy S III, I was worried about finding accessories.  No problem!  I found chargers (it uses a micro USB, like many other products), cases, skins, etc...If you need a phone, this is the best $300 you'll ever spend!!!", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Product!", "Author": "Isvely", "ReviewID": "R3R54H6F7YO8XK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It made my life easier, now I can send emails, read the latest news, and contact instantly in just one device!

It's fine so far.The phone is a lovely, sleek thing. I've handled its bigger brother, the Galaxy SIII, but that phone is just too big for me. I like the form and size of this one much better. I've been using an HTC Evo 4G phone for more than two years; this Galaxy S3 Mini is about the same size.This is a good phone with plenty of computing horsepower for me. The screen is beautiful and very responsive. In side-by-side comparison to my trusty old HTC Evo phone, this one blows the other one away. And the Galaxy S3 Mini has a slightly smaller screen! I'd wondered if I'd regret it for that reason but I absolutely do not. I don't even realize that the screen is smaller than my old phone, when I'm using this phone.One downside: I don't like the camera. It's laggy.By the way, my phone arrived with packaging in French, and set up with the French language on the phone. The seller included a plug adapter so the Euro style plug on the charger can be used here in the USA. It took a few seconds to get into the phone settings and choose US English as the phone language.PLEASE, people, don't complain if you get a \"foreign\" phone when you buy this phone unlocked. Because Samsung doesn't package this phone for sale for the US market. (Search for an article on Cnet called \"Apple drops patent claim against Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini\" from December 2012 for the background.) I found a user manual in English by going to Samsung's UK website (it won't be on Samsung's US website because Samsung doesn't sell or support this phone in the US).

This is a true smart phone in all aspects. I use an iPhone and the first thing we tried was to locate an establishment. We both have 4g service. The Samsung outperforms the iPhone by a great margin. The screen is slightly larger and much more brighter. There are great apps, in fact more than you will ever need or use so don't let a competitor's brag about having lots of apps turn you off.The apps are easy to download and install. Everything that was on the EVO was easily transferred to the Galaxy. There are a limited number of incoming phone ring tones however you can download additional rings if there are none that suit you. We did find that with the sue of hearing aids the ring tones installed as somewhat weak and only a few can be turned up really loud.My wife uses the phone a  greta dal for texting and the larger key board makes that much easier on this phone.

Systematic symptoms keep appearing as time progresses. One of the first things that started was after about a month or so. There is a wicked echo that people on the other side can hear, but you can not. This is a major problem when you get into an automated system. It hears itself and keeps erroring out because it cant understand your response even though you dont say anything. Later on another symptom that started coming up is that the touch screen bugs out. Sometimes it will not recognize, sometimes it will click all over the place nonstop untill you restart and sometimes it has a 5-10 second lag. Alot of people on the other end can not hear me well. I have been told it is like talking to someone through a sheet rock wall. Its just really muffled. Another problem is that it apps do not like to run properly. sometimes I will to have to close it out and reopen it several times. Another problem is that when it charges, it will charge up to the point it is 100%, then it turns itself off. So almost everyday I wake up to my phone being off. That or i watch it real close when i'm at work and unplug it at 95%. Another problem thats is kinda strange is that it does not like cold. If it gets cold (like 60 or less) the touch screen will not work, and someitmes it will turn itself off. It works fine if you keep in your pocket, but when i leave it on the bedside table at night during the winter i wake up to a non-functioning phone. This thing is garbage. I will be tossing it in the bricked phone drawer when i get enough $ to get away from it. Who knows, I may take it outside and give it the proper \"office space\" treatment.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excelente", "Author": "Pedro Flores", "ReviewID": "R2SII8VP4LCMVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "all very well as indicated thanks for everything hope to continue buying soon. the team works very well and arrived with all its accessories", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent, but...", "Author": "Angel Javier Figueras", "ReviewID": "R1CHHSFGUL8UDR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent!

Small, Durable.

I didn't even ask it to, didn't know it could, it just did it. That made life easy.I also downloaded the Media Monkey app and was able to transfer my music library easily to the 32G card. No need for an ipod anymore.Durability - I don't have a case for it yet and it is a little slippery.The first day I had it I dropped it on my ceramic tile floor - no damage. A week or so later I almost fell down some steps outside my house. The hand I had to use to stop my fall had my unprotected cell-phone in it. The phone smacked a concrete ledge while I was gripping it and slid right on the corner with quite a bit of my 230 lbs on it. I thought the phone was done, expected a shattered screen or at least deep gouges on the back. Not a scratch.I owned a cell-phone store for 17 years and would highly recommend the S III Mini.The only drawback is some of the operation isn't quite intuitive enough. I.E. I didn't know my alarm was off and was getting up for work. It doesn't tell you it is off or on, you would have to know that if the clock icon is green, it is on, if it is black, it is off. It also took me like 2 days to figure out where some messages were going and why alerts were happening. I'm sure it is all in the manual but simple words like off/on, press here for message etc. would be nice. I'm not a fan of ambiguous icons.The only other complaint is the speaker when listening to music is not very loud, even on the headset. Plugged in to my home or car stereo it Rocks though. I am going to try an amplified headset and see how that works.I had a couple of iphones for years and bottom line is I thing this phone easily outshines them and won't hold your music hostage.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bad Phone", "Author": "Araceli", "ReviewID": "R3JWTP67MGN1Q2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this phone is pirate in all its aspects, whether looking for a good phone do not buy this product. writes a buyer", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Yay!", "Author": "Chile C.

But i'm plagued with issues, first, in the past four weeks the battery has only charged up past 73% once, this is after a full 8 hours on the charger. Second the battery lasts about a day and a half on a good day,on a bad day about 6 hours. That's probably because it doesn't fully recharge. Third, I thought I was buying a 8 GB version, when looking at the stats in the phone, I have about 4GB of memory. That means the OS is taking up about 4 GB! Now connectivity, I've seen 3G about 4 days out of the last month, that could be my area or not close enough to a tower(within a mile). I'm not sure how this other issue happens, it's a GSM phone, when I go to a CDMA only area, the phone loses all service, refuses to be charged and doesn't shut off. Service it shows a circle with a line through it, I can connect to hot spots and blue tooth items, but cannot make or recieve calls. I've tried four different chargers, none work unless I'm in a GSM area, same chargers!!!!  This next issue happened on two different weekends in the same town that is CDMA only. I held the power button and selected \"power off\" with 10% battery left, two hours later the phone flashed and beeped indicating low battery so i shut the phone off again. The next day it flashed again and beep, I checked the phone there was 1% left, I just left it alone after that. That was last weekend, when I got back into a GSM area I plugged it into a charger, it took almost 20 minutes before the phone would turn on to check the charge status. It charged up to 73% and stopped charging. I know the problems, but, I really like the phone, too. I'm going to try getting a new battery or multiple batteries.

No problem setting it up once I realized the online instructions didn't match the slot I was looking for (I was looking at installing the SIM in the microSD slot).  Watched a YouTube video showing how to install both and everything worked great.I'm impressed with several of the installed Samsung apps (S Planner).

All of the rave I have heard about the Samsung Galaxy family of phones is completely warranted. The Pros highly outweigh the Cons (I mean every phone has some growing pains/faults right?). Out of the box the phone like most smartphones looks pretty vulnerable to drop damage so buying a case is highly highly recommended. It took me a few days to get used to the Android system but I find it user friendly once you learn what all of the menus (particularly in the settings) contain.

Jones", "ReviewID": "R24NSWGP1HIM2R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There isn't much to complain about with this phone.  It is a perfect size to be truly mobile (i.e. carry in your pocket) and is as large as it can be while still allowing access to the full screen with a single thumb (unlike the full sized S3).  The display is crisp and clear.  The rear speaker is amazingly clear and loud -- I can actually hear the navigation app while driving.  Also, the rear LED is amazingly bright, which can be quite handy for things other than taking pictures.  Battery life is great, easily lasting all day unless I use it VERY heavily.My complaints are pretty minor:- It would be nice if the display got brighter when using outside... but it is still acceptable.- I can't understand why Samsung left a trivial sensor like a light sensor out of this phone... but it really doesn't bother me since the display really doesn't get that bright anyway.- This phone *requires* a case.  By that I mean that it is simply too slippery to use successfully long-term without fumbling it and dropping it routinely.  The fact that it is sleek and slim doesn't help either, although that is certainly not a complaint.  Luckily, there is a very nice case for this phone that has great grip and doesn't add much bulk:  B00AW692YW- It can be a little slow at times.  For example, pulling up the phone app often takes a couple of seconds.  For such a fundamental app, I would have hoped it would be better optimized.  Many other apps also take some time to open.

The problem is the battery - a week and a half ago the battery started draining very quickly unexpectedly (I bought the phone in July 2013) - it would go from 100% to almost zero in 2-3 hours. I turned it off one night at 100% charge and in the morning it had completely drained. Luckily the problem was indeed the batter and not phone itself because the new battery works fine and the phone continues to work great.

Some people don't want a 5 inch screen. This is still a bit bigger than I'd prefer, but the screen is beautiful. OLED screens are quite nice.Pros: smallish form factor, thin, nice screen, fast processor, everything seems to work, newer version of androidCons:- power buttn is far too easy to push in pocket, requires a case to prevent that.- poor syncing with google. It seems better to use the native Samsung apps, which is uneccesarily complex, especially if you were used to using the native android google apps. I'm talking mainly gmail, calendar. Contacts work OK. It's really annoying when you set them phone up, to A) figure out that gmail syncing simpl6y doesn't work well, and then B) figurte out how to use the native Samsung apps AND have them sync with google. On the other hand, the native Samsung apps are nice.- Using this unlocked on Tmobile, it doesn't have the 1700 MHz band for Tmobile 3G and up, so you only get 3g+ in areas where TMobile has fully converted their towers to the 1900 MHz band. However, that is ongoing, and it seems to have mostly happened in my area. That said, I wouldn't say my internet is much faster than with my old LG optimus. That's probably a TMobile thing.- Again, it';s very easy to turn the darn thing on in your pocket, you ought to be able to specify which buttons activate it.- Battery life is basically one day.

First, the charger plug was not what I expected. I expected to receive a plug that can be used in the United States with voltage of 110v. The one I recived was intended to be used at Middle East countries. I also expected Spanish (my native language) to be one of the phone's default language, besides English of course, so I have to download the language addon. Another point to mention is that while on the phone box (as at Amazon's Order page) is printed the phone have 8GB of Internal Memory, the properties of Android system reflects the phone's Internal Memory is barely 4.55 Gb.

You can see that complaining on short battery life is not productive at all since it is not just phone's fault. There are many factors that contribute to short battery life: wireless coverage in the area you live, whether you have all possible social gimmicks turned on that keep draining your battery, running apps in background that are poorly written and waste CPU cycles, amount of time the screen is on and so on.Hope this review is helpful.

I'm currently with TMobile, and I was told when I activated the phone that their network did not provide 3G or 4G to this particular phone, so I would be stuck with 2G.

The problem was android is still messy OS (4.2.1) IMHO, after all these years. I had no control over home screen icons (Samsung or Android issue ? not sure or maybe both) and ended up with several blank, orphaned screens that would not delete.  I really don't want to spend hours hunting for 3rd party apps that actually make a phone useable for basic needs. That should be covered out of the box. I later found an app that would have given me such user control but had already returned the unit. So if your into doing a lot of OS fiddling this is a great phone.

I use my watch as a backup just in case the phone alarm doesnt go off.Also sometimes have to restart the phone cuz the 3G or 4G service will stop working. Unexplainable too. You will see the the data being sent but not being received back into the phone. So occasionally will have to restart the phone. Other than that it is still a great phone.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "exclent", "Author": "luis vasquez", "ReviewID": "R13NXFFZTY611Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "powerful and compact cell in relation to large s3 but equally powerful with the dual-core processor and Android vercion, sleek and lightweight design", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "happiness in home", "Author": "Guillermo Albornoz", "ReviewID": "R3762W2FH7MUBO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My daughter is very happy with her cellphone she was waiting for it.

After a lot of research and comparing its specs with other brands I decided to buy it.(If you live in Venezuela keep reading 'till the end)I always has been a Sony Xperia user but I wanted to upgrade quickly. As you might know, the Xperia series is an amazing multimedia device, sounds great and their screens are beautiful.So, with that in mind I'll mention something important about this Samsung:1) The internal memory is only 4.5 Gb2) The phone hasn't a sensor to adjust the brithness automatically, I have to adjust it manually everytime.3) The sound quality of the built-in speaker and it's included earbuds are mediocre, they sound a bit loud, but that's it, the equalizer does not help at all. By the way, I have a pair of sennheiser headphones/earbuds and they do not work with the phone, the headphone jack is 3.5 mm but it appears to be constructed only to work properly with the included headphones.4) It doesn't have a light to tell when there's a unreaded message or to tell if the phone is charging or not.5) The quality of calls are just ok, sometimes I can't ever hear the other person talk.6) The battery life is very short, I have to charge it everyday for 2-3 hours minimun.7) Everything says \"Made in China\", The phone, the battery, the earbuds... everything!Aside from these cons, the phone is a great mid-range device...P.S. (Spanish):En Venezuela no levanta 3G con Digitel, no se si con Movistar o Movilnet tampoco porque no he probado a\u00fan. Lo compre a \"ShopVius\" por si les da curiosidad.

Before getting my Samsung Galaxy s3 I had a iPhone 3gs. I was having a lot of problems with my iPhone even though I kept the updates current and tried my best to baby it when it was acting up. I was kind of over the whole iPhone thing so I decided on this phone. From day one I was so impressed with this phone I couldn't be more happy. The screen is bigger than what I was use to but I don't think it is too big. The screen is also very clear and the colors are very vivid. I am still learning all the fun little tricks you can do on this device but overall I think it is very easy to use. I was worried a little bit about the app store for an android phone but to tell you the truth it has all the apps I loved on my iPhone and some great new ones that I love using. If you are debating on a new phone this is a great phone to consider. I know some places certain colors and how much memory the phone has changes the price. So if you decide on this phone I would suggest getting the cheapest color because you most likely are gonna put a cover on it right!? So it doesn't really matter what the color is. Also I would suggest getting the least memory if it is cheaper than the higher ones because you can always add a card for more memory which is a lot cheaper than paying for more memory on your phone.

I took my SIM out of my 4G Galaxy SII and put it in this phone.  Reading the description and reviews I was under the impression I would get 4G.  At worst 3G.  Well, all I can get is the EDGE network.  The phone came in the default setting of French.  Had I not known the Samsung platform (I've owned the Captivate and SII) I wouldn't have been able to figure out how to get to English.  The phone is too small to type on and it doesn't have auto correct, it has the predictive word feature.  Don't even think of getting accessories for this phone in America.  The AT&T; store didn't even know what the heck I handed them.  The guys there have never seen or heard of this phone.  You can't find a case.  When someone calls you and you miss the call you can't go into the call log to call them back.  The default layout of the phone shows international calls.  It doesn't come up as (555) 555-5555.  It shows up as +5555555555.  I still haven't been able to figure that out months later.  I used that feature a bunch on my Galaxy SII. Being a business owner I get calls from people all the time that are not in my contact list.  The camera is horrible and there is so much junk loaded on this phone when it comes it bogs down just trying to get out of it's own way.  Even when you restart the phone or turn it on the phone uses over 400 of the 800MB of Ram.  I could go on and on about how much I hate this phone.  Spend a few extra bucks and get something better.  The only reason I bought this phone is because I dropped my SII (first phone I've ever ruined and I started with a Motorola Startac) and can't upgrade for 8 months.  When I get my new phone I will recreate the \"Office Space\" scene in the field with the fax machine with this phone.

Am thinking of asking the seller if I can upgrade it. The problem is that 8 Gb of RAM isn't enough if you want to take advantage of the Android system to the fullest. One of the selling points of the Android system (for me) was that it can do so much, and it looks like that takes lots of RAM.  I've had it for a week now and have downloaded quite a few apps but not all that many. The problem is that the system files and bloatware take up almost half of the memory. And you can save music and video files, and books and photos, to the external micro SD card, but not apps. All your apps have to fit into the built-in ram, not into the SD card you insert yourself. And if you want to download big apps you'll run up against warnings that the memory is full. I was trying to download a Wikipedia app when this happened to me. I suspect that there are lots of games that take a lot of memory, too.I read on the net that you could root the phone and download an app that would save your apps to the external micro SD card, but I'm not that adventurous.So I did a factory reset and deleted some apps. And re-installed some of the apps I wanted. BUT I'm not happy having to do that. The largest micro SD card the SIII Mini will take is 32 Gb, and I was really disappointed at not being able to use that for apps. And it spoils the thrill to have to worry about using all my RAM. There are lots of threads about this issue on Android Central, which I recommend for anyone considering this phone.Another issue I ran into was that the wi-fi wouldn't connect. Android Central has lots of discussions of this problem. I tried lots of fixes but what worked was that I had been putting in the wrong password. You put in the WEP password. There is another password that I'd written down but it wasn't the one that I'd needed. So just make sure you have the right password.I looked through the reviews before I ordered but didn't see anything about these two issues anywhere on-line.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "As always, perfect!", "Author": "Patrick Cline \"PCnCarolina\"", "ReviewID": "R2YZ7ZOT00XTGH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To date, I have never been disappointed with any order from these folks.

The S Voice looked nice but they want pretty much all of your information if you do. Not too comfy with that yet. Maybe later.  GPS not the paragon of precision although this may be a Google map issue. Showed the location to be about 500+ feet (about half a block) from actual location so would not use it for semi precise guidance. Tried the FM radio. Good for fairly strong stations.Big complaint about the phone loudness for the FM Radio. AUDIO LEVEL at lowest setting, 1, is TOO LOUD!!!! WTF!!!!! Do they have deaf people in their testing labs? Fer crying out loud I am 59, had my ears blown out by everyone from Steppenwolf to the Dead Kennedys in the basement of a student Co-op. This is ridiculous. Turning down system audio level does not help. Cannot use standard 3 contact stereo headphone jacks. Uses a 4 contact one.11/14/13Well just realized that the GPS probably hasn't been on most of the time I have used it. SO the question is the GPS broken or is it a function of the 4.1.1 OS. May upgrade to 4.1.2 manually.Several other things, this is a Brit version so no domestic support. with AT&T; that may include not upgrading the phone to 4.1.2  KIES won't do it because it has the wrong version of firmware.

The size of this phone seems \"perfect\" in my hands and I can use it with just one hand.  The screen looks vibrant and everything runs smoothly (so far).  I feel that this phone is more aesthetic than the bigger Galaxy SIII simply because it's smaller.  However I should note that the bigger Galaxy SIII has better specs than the miniature version.  I also liked that it's compatible with T-mobile.However I experienced massive delays on this phone that I haven't with other phones.  I don't think the phone is slow, and It's also not a T-mobile's network issue.  I'm thinking it has to do with the antennae or compatibility issues with the phone itself.  Whenever I go inside a building, I lose connection in most buildings.  I did not lose connection with my other Nokia phone using the same network.  Additionally there would be times the bars in the same spot would randomly go up and down for no apparent reason - meaning that sometimes in the same spot (for example my room) I could make calls or I can't make calls at all.  However my Nokia had no issues.  So I concluded that it has something to do with the phone.  With that said, it works with T-mobile most of the time, but I found those issues to be an annoyance.Overall It's hard to say whether or not this phone is worth it because from what I been reading, it seems to be a location issue.  So some places it might work just fine while other places it won't.  Assuming that you don't have the delay issue that I do, then this phone is definitely solid.

I'm nursing it along for months now, factory reboots, re booting by removing the battery, I have nursed it back to  85% reliability from 40% reliable.  Will never buy another international phone again.  It's technology and when it breaks, you are on your own.  Should have bought the Apple 4S to get this form factor.  10-30-2013Still learning the ins and outs of my first smart phone, sad and glad I got the mini, nice form factor, but I've seen the S3 and Note and wow, what a screen!  Anyway, I know mine will survive skiing, rollerblading, etc, with less drops because I can pocket the mini much more conveniently.  I found the HH Hand Held Devices cases work great and a holster made for iPhone 4's work pretty damn good.  Fits nicely.  The phone call quality is great, data side works smoothly, touch screen is good, but tough for texting, Blackberry keyboard was much nicer with it's tactile feedback.  Battery life is fair, seems to be improving with use and some juice saving measures, don't use GPS and WiFi when not needed, get black screen background.  Lower screen light level when indoors, but DO put it up to maximum when outdoors in order to see in sunlight. (still a little tough, need to be in shade).  Wish it had a notification light like Blackberry, have to press buttons to see status on this one. It's ok, you get used to it pretty quick, but can't see status from across room if you leave it on the kitchen counter.  One negative is too much bloat ware,  had to go to settings to Uninstall alot of it, still figuring out what else to dump.  Jelly Bean 4.1.2 works great, no problems so far. Oh yes, when I got the phone it started up in German, couldn't read it.....scary!...but go to YOuTube and search change S3 Mini language, it was pretty easy after that...Will update further in future, but 6 weeks in, I give it 4 stars. I paid 325 for it 2 months ago, is now 275.

However, this phone does support 4G, even though it's not reflected in its name.Strangely, the status bar at the store was showing \"4G\" although the list of networks mode in the phone settings only shows GSM/WCDMA and GSM only - precisely the same settings that you'll see in S3 Mini. My daughter owns the original S3 Mini and it shows \"H\" on T-Mobile network instead of \"4G\" - which probably means HSPA+ (T-Mobile's version of 4G).The phone looks identical to S3 Mini and the only difference that I noticed is the list of available languages in the settings: unlike S3 Mini, which supports a few dozen languages, Galaxy Exhibit only supports a handful of languages.I wonder if this will push Amazon prices on S3 Mini down a bit.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent cellphone but...", "Author": "Jessica Soto", "ReviewID": "R1MKKB4LFS7X5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It restarts itself like 4 or 5 times per day, and theres time's when it  goes off and doesn't turn on again untill i turn it on... i don't know how to solve it, it started since the very first day of use... i've used it for 1 week and i decided to change it.It came with a manufacturing flaw", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "todo bien", "Author": "Gladys", "ReviewID": "R2FZ8OM0HH39N5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "me encanta mi telefono le queria preguntar si el telefono trae memoria el mio no la trajo yo se que tiene memoria interna .", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good So Far", "Author": "A Dangerous Person", "ReviewID": "R3KAQE0ZHPPIHF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm upgrading from an old-skool iphone 3g, so almost any new smartphone will be an improvement.That being said, I like it after 3 weeks.It's fast, fits in my pocket, and all the features work excellent.The only problem is that sometimes it makes my left leg go numb.This is mostly because it forces me to sit longer on the toilet whilst I play with apps.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelente", "Author": "Gustavo Cotorett", "ReviewID": "R1JRRJVIPM3I9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Muy buen tel\u00e9fono, todo bien, muy r\u00e1pido, buenas fotos, corren bien las aplicaciones, pantalla n\u00edtida, buenos colores, 8 Gb de memoria interna.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": ".", "Author": "lupe ramirez", "ReviewID": "R28HFEGRWX27JQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": ".el producto me parecio de muy buena calidad y el env\u00edo lleg\u00f3 a tiempo, por lo tanto considero que dan un buen servicio.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Ricardo Ludwig", "ReviewID": "RATF0ZMKBCUDU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excelente muy buena pieza de coleccion saludos desde Venezuela espero comprar mas en algun momento por que son muy bonitas y buenas", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buen celular pero me vino en Polaco...lo compre para Venezuela", "Author": "Maru", "ReviewID": "R5CAUP7AAVYRV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's an excellent cel but idiom is Polaco (PL) i'm going to look out how to change this idiom to spanish, :S Idon't know whyyyyyy seller you could do that ok rrrrrrrrrrr", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone..", "Author": "Carlos", "ReviewID": "RRTIBL6TKV7QR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "S GSIII is Great..

True, some of them are just the curse - yes, CURSE - of touchscreen (baby)technology, which is still quite lame compared to real buttons. And no, these are not \"malfunctions,\" they are design flaws, period - I saw these same issues on other minis.The following are the anti-features you can expect:- a touch screen that often does not respond at the speed demanded - this creates a HUGE risk during driving, when a user has to avert his/her eyes to try, try, try, try, try to answer and activate the speaker (and end the call), especially as the screen repeatedly blacks out (for what? to save the pathetic battery power?) and canNOT be quickly revived. This is particularly fun when answering calls from clients, who do not expect to wait as this little piece of crap decides if and when its owner can answer it, or when dealing with automated systems that don't understand why it takes so long to press the directed key.- the telephone shuts itself off without being touched, and even with a full battery- the telephone cuts off the internet connection on a regular basis, without being touched, without a change in location, even in the middle of an online function during what a second ago had been an active connection. This did not happen to me with my previous telephones.- press on the SMS button, frequently get the camera - repeatedly - until the mail decides to wake up- try to send an SMS, and it tells you it failed even when it didn't, or that it was sent even when it failed; wait 4 days to get an important SMS- try to send an SMS, and it hides the \"create new mail\" function for a few hours- receive an SMS, and occasionally have to guess who sent it, while being thankful that at least it was designed to display the name/number of the sender- press on the missed calls function, get the last person YOU called- search for a number in your phone, Russian roulette if it comes up- and of course, the battery drains very, very, very quickly when you use it for internet accessIf you need your telephone to really function, try another company.
