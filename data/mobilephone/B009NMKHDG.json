Right off the bat didn't get a tracking number. And once I did I tracked it and it had been delivered to Chicago. Were in Montana.... I contacted the seller and they immediately responded and sent out a new phone. When we recieved the phone the quality of the phone was terrible. It's almost like a toy phone. Very dissatisfied. And on top of it all it took a month and 4 days to get here.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "regular", "Author": "jose", "ReviewID": "R1DDFJNE38U1CQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "this device has not filled my expectations.
