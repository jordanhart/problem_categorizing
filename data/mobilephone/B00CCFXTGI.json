It performs better than any phone I have ever had. Plenty of memory, good sized processer, GMSA (AT&T;).

I bought it right through the Straight Talk website, and let me tell you...mistake! At the time, it was the nicest phone that they had to purchase. Do not buy it. It is super slow, and lags all of the time. The camera has the absolute worst lag ever. Apps freeze up, then crash. The keyboard freezes up, and you have to restart the phone entirely for the keyboard to even type on it...and don't even get me started on the time it takes to restart this phone!", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money!!!!", "Author": "Robert Cook", "ReviewID": "R3E1JH1KBBZ68W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This by far is the worst phone I ever had.  The price for the thing is way to much for the horrendous performance.  Don't even think of playing music and trying to text at the same time....LAG, LAG, and more lag.  My old Motorola Bravo is faster than this piece of crap!  I installed android 4.2.2 on my Bravo and it has no issues at all if i would have known this I would not have bought the LG junk...", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG L40G Extreme Cell Phone", "Author": "arleen", "ReviewID": "R2KYA81C5F4NAX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It did not work.

Ive had it since March and use it for the WiFi only and I think it looks great. It has many screen customizations. It could use more internal memory but thats what we paid for. It has Google Play Store where you can download any app. It works with ShopKick. One of the few phones that do. It has a customizable top bar where you can turn on WiFi and Bluetooth and many other features without having to go to settings. If you want to add apps or widgets to your 5 customizable screens you just hold down your finger on a blank part of the screen and the apps, widgets, wallpaper-anything comes up on the bottom and your 5 screens right above. You can make folders and pick your own color for say like a Games Folder or Banking Folder or any folder. It takes awhile to boot up but that is fine. All in all for wifi connection only this phone is a beaut.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "cheetahcat1980", "ReviewID": "R3876TZ2NTNXOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The price is a little higher on here than Walmart's website but they were sold out. This model runs on the AT&T; network and so far really enjoy it. It has larger fonts which is great and not too complicated to understand it's navigation's through menus. Nice having the larger screen and 4.0 Android as well.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Piece of crap", "Author": "Matt Wills", "ReviewID": "R27DB5UV0O98BX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Painfully slow opening just the phone, and once it's open, sometimes takes more than a minute to actually complete a call.A long list of settings that do not survive a restart.
