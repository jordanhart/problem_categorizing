{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Firefly Mobile Cell Pone for Kids", "Author": "ok so far", "ReviewID": "R12O4NN68DJJX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Arrived promptly yesterday in a new, unopened package including charger, manuals and clip.  The phone comes with a Firefly Mobile SIM card inserted but I didn't activate it through Firefly.  I charged the phone for a couple hours first, then took it to a local AT&T; store and had them remove the Firefly SIM and put in a new AT&T; SIM card (free with activation).  I purchased prepaid minutes (see AT&T; website for pricing) right then and left within 10 minutes with a completely functional phone with its own phone number, fully activated.  No problem at all.  If you wish to verify the phone will work before purchasing minutes simply ask the sales person (or a friend with an AT&T; phone) to put an already active AT&T; SIM card in the phone first to test it.  My salesman inserted the card from his own phone into the Firefly phone and I called it from my cell phone and the Firefly phone lit up and rang.  Since then I've tested almost every function and it seems to work as expected.  Programming the phone is simple and the included manual is well written and easy to follow.  One snag was when I tried to access the prepaid AT&T; account online (to view minutes usage) it text-messaged my initial PIN to the phone!  The phone can't receive text messages, so I went back to the AT&T; store and had the salesman put my SIM in HIS phone and had AT&T; resend the PIN and he received the text-message for me on his phone and told me what it was!  You may want to do this on your first visit to the store, or any AT&T; phone should work as a temporary host for your SIM for this purpose.", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "glad i ordered", "Author": "sat.practice", "ReviewID": "RDFAIOWJ7ZSJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this for my 86 year old father who does better not having to remember numbers.  it came in a jar with clip and charger.  It did take me a while to figure out what other sim card would work because I didn't want to use a firefly sim.  I took it to at&t; after a couple t-mobile trys.  At&t; wasn't sure what to do with it but he worked at it.  Was first told by their tech guys that he would have to unlock it through Cingular but he said they are the old Cingular. He then activated it with one of their at&t; sim cards and the computer immediately recognized it as a firefly (even though they don't sell them anymore.) I bought a $25.00 prepaid card and I now get 250 minutes every three months which is more than enough for my dad.  It's a brand new phone that came packaged nicely.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "NOT VERIZON", "Author": "Everett Daviage", "ReviewID": "R377ZV18SO7IAR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was not a Verizon plan.
