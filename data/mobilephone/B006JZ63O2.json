I know NEVER to buy electronics over the internet, they most likely are broken or used products. Guess what, this is the SECOND Defy plus I purchased from this seller. I love, love, love these phones. I have the MB 525 from two years ago, still working, not a scratch on it. I do keep a protective case and film on the screen 99% of the time. The things can be dropped, get wet, taken to the beach in the sand, you name it. What Ive done is bought one for my son and wife. The plus is quicker, all black body and I buy the 32 mb memory card for their phones. The size is perfect, it is probably the smallest of the smart phones, yet the screen is bigger than an iphone 4 (compare them side by side). It is most combarable to between an iphone 4 and 4s. The iphone 5 is almost better on every front except with this you can change the memory card for cheap and it is INDESTRUCTABLE. Not only that, but buy the Motorola car mount for under ten bucks from amazon. Fantastic deal. If my two year old defy ever gives out, Im buying a third from this seller. Excellent, no dissapointments. Great phone for adults, great price and protection for kids first smart phone/cell phone.", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Cali", "ReviewID": "R1O4JFUU7DODTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought 2 of these phones one for me & one for my husband & we really like them.

I would have bought it in China or HK to get the character sets I need for travel there, but the price on Amazon was half as much as those markets.

No extra set-up needed.- Built tough. I've dropped it twice so far and got a little water on it, no problems.- Smooth and snappy, I turned off auto update on apps and data sync, noticed better performance instantly.- Great speaker! Its bright and crisp and LOUD!- Phone functions are above-average:  Clear call quality with good signal strength, have yet to experience a dropped call.Cons:- Comes with Android OS 2.3, no planned update beyond that. Want ICS or Jelly Bean? Gotta root it and risk bricking your phone.- Video cam mode can only record @ VGA quality.- Physical power button feels somewhat cheap/flimsy.- Music player will randomly stop or freeze while listening to internet radio, maybe a Gingerbread bug, the app updated itself yet issue persists.- Included phone charger is of questionable quality, I ended up using my old Blackberry charger instead.UPDATE:Very poor screen performance in direct sunlight, dark themes and wallpaper help a tiny bit...Had run into problems with the phone randomly rebooting. I finally did a factory reset and AVOIDED creating a MotoBlur account (hit the options button on the left when the prompt comes up and choose to skip creating an account). No more random reboots :) PLease note that without Motoblur, you will not have access to the Moto apps but these can be easily replaced with apps from the Playstore, oh also you wont be able to do a system upodate...as if they ever where anyways lolPlaying music files or listening to internet radio is still not 100% but seems to have gotten better without MotoBlur.Currently using a custom launcher (ADW with minimal theme) and have good overall performance. Previously used GoLauncher but uninstalled due to several freezing issues.Can confirm that phone is able to use TELCEL and Movistar pre-paid sims and data.I advice against rooting. Process is very complicated and risky due to 4 different hardware/software configurations for this model.

I like the rugged style phones that I don't have to worry about spilling a drink on or dropping on the floor. My old phone was a Casio Commando and it was truly a rugged outdoor phone. I had it for 3 years and bounced it off the concrete several times and got it wet a few times and it held up great. The Motorola Defy is a descent rugged phone but it does not feel as rugged as the Commando. The Defy has covers for the charging port and ear phone port but they do not have a rubber O-ring seal like the Commando to keep water out. The Commando also has a rubber O-ring seal on the back battery cover to keep water out but the Defy does not. The Defy has a smaller overall body than the Commando and the Defy feels lighter making it feel less durable than the Commando. The screens are the same size on both phones but the Defy's screen feels less protected since it is not recessed in the body like the Commando. Adding the rubberized case really helped the Defy feel more durable overall without adding additional bulk to the phone. Performance of the phone is good for what I need, but I don't like to carry around a giant high performance phone that doubles as a tablet. Camera on the Defy is nothing to write home about, but it doesn't bother me because if I want good pics or video I will use my GoPro or Canon. Screen size is small so if you does a lot of texting or web browsing you might not like it. For me though I like the phone because it's a small light weight smart phone that I can get wet or drop and not worry about and it fits in my pockets well.
