I love how it feels in the hand; MUCH better than my husbands RAZR! I was happy to find a phone in my favorite color, and the green is wearing well.I have not had any problems with this phone, although I have had some issues getting the software on my computer.It's a fully functional cellphone, the equal of my husband's RAZR and better than the Nokia I had before it.I don't understand why the PEBL isn't more popular, honestly!", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "best motorola since v60", "Author": "V.

I hated my razr and bought this unlocked from Motorola's website. Other than the issues of having to program all the gateways and codes for your carrier so that the texting and multimedia messages will work, everything is great. I highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "November 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "S.

This phone is great. It's unlocked so all you need to do is put in your simcard and your phone is ready. The hardware is great. It looks adorable and the slide to flip action makes me happy ^_^. I only use my phone for calling and texting so i didn't mind that the internet won't work. Saves me the extra bits it would cost if i accidentally presed the web button.If you broke your phone and you don't want to buy a used phone. get this one. great price for a working phone.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Really very nice Phone", "Author": "S D G \"shiveringwhippet\"", "ReviewID": "R2L7181CJSHI40", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The green color on the web page has a more 'sage' look, the actual phone is slightly more yellow-green, and metallic, which came as a disappointment, however, I really like this phone - it is a beautiful design inside and out.

If your a gamer i dont recommed this phone b/c u cant downlad games i was highly  dissappointed about that. sometimes when somebody is trying to call me i will flip open the phone and it will automatically will either just keep vibrating, will make this horribble siren noise, or just drop it all together.and to make the phone turn back on or stop doing this i would have to take the battery out and put it back in, so now my battery cover comes off all the time now from me having to do that so much. now if your a person who is somewhat clumsy or drops there phone every once in a while i strongly suggest u not to get this phone. and if your person who is not that i still dont reccomed this phone b/c its just a bad phone overall.", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
