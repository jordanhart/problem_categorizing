SIM card. So long story short your going to have to drive to an AT&T; store anyway so don't waste the time and money like i did. ( I live 2 hours from the nearest AT&T; store :/) the other reviews here are about people having to drive to the store anyway and they seem happy about it, i don't understand why just go to the store and tell them Customer service said you can pick up a free SIM card and they will hand you one and activate it there for FREE!, please excuse and spelling and grammar mistakes, i didnt really feel like posting this review i figured i would just save someone else the trouble.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is what it is", "Author": "Benjax", "ReviewID": "R1ZOM7CWBGPTM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my mom who is visiting from her home country.
