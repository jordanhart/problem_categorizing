After handling it for some time I can say that it rests comfortably in the hand and compared to my previous 4.3\" phone, this one is a touch smaller. The screen has beautiful contrast and colors, the camera takes terrific photos. Combine that with a super smooth experience and I really can't complain, especially considering the price point. Yes, it's no quad core monster - but it also doesn't cost as much. Good luck trying to find a better phone under $300 unlocked.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone, excellent value, but needs more internal memory", "Author": "Brian K", "ReviewID": "R21WTKP3SDUCHU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned 3-4 smartphones in recent years, including LG and Samsung and use 3,000 minutes or more per month, so I have good take on smartphones for business or personal use.This Sony device is the winner over my prior phones. Here are the reasons.1) The voice quality is excellent. When compared to my last two phones (Samsung and LG), there has never been an issue hearing the other party in any sound environment, either using handset or speakerphone. Every word is clear and easily understood... I can't say this with my other phones (Samsung and LG) as I often had trouble hearing the other party. I believe Sony has created speakers (handset and speakphone) that amplify certain aspects of human speech, which, again, sound quality is excellent on this device. On the other end, no party has ever had trouble hearing me (either using handset or speakerphone- and speakerphone works well hearing me from any distance).2) Excellent battery/energy saving features.  Battery uses less energy and Sony has feature that allows certain apps to shut-down or sleep. Battery life is excellent.3) Fast processor - no problem using any apps, downloads. Functionality is excellent. Device can and will freeze up occasionally, but rebooting is easy and fairly fast, not much time.4) For music fanatics/video usage, the sound quality is excellent. The music player/Walkman on this device is significantly better than my last two smartphones. Sony has a history with the Walkman, and the sound quality on this device is excellent. Video is good as well, although I do not use as much.5) Scratch-resistant glass - glass simply does not scratch, you do not need a screen protector.6) excellent camera - quality is fantastic - 8.0mp... better than the last two devices (LG and Samsung).There are some negatives, notable the internal space tends to fill up at time, making apps unoperable.This device would be 100% the best phone on the market other than issues with internal memory, Sony should add more memory.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "GOOD", "Author": "Carlos adrian villasana", "ReviewID": "R1L276V6CODIY6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the most faster and powerful smartphones, very slim, big screen even small size, it works IN VENEZUELA WITH MOVISTAR, MOVILNET, if you want to use with DIGITEL 3G you must buy Xperia L c2105", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "awesome phone awesome deal", "Author": "R.

Had to return this phone because only had 5.9gb (1.9gb device mem & 4gb internal mem.)of user storage not 8gb as stated. I really liked this phone but after getting 6 apps it tells you you are almost out of storage. Now I looking for 16gb phone.-----------Got this way before the delivered day by a week, got it new out of the box. So nice to have it didn't think it was going to be so great. Before this one I bought a Nokia 520 but did not like the setup of that phone and plus it only used micro-sim. This phone uses REGULAR SIM with storage expansion.For me its a perfect cell phone, working smoothly, it recognized network immediately so far no problems or malfunction. I have downloaded several apps one after the other got them working without hassle. Call quality is good, the size and resolution of the screen is really awesome, and the speed the tasks are done, and even to switch from one to another no hesitation.I took a star off because the camera is not that great even for a 8-mp as for the sd card I have to remove the battery to insert/remove it, also I can't take a panel at on screen while in lock mode its just empty with a big + on it.I'm currently using H2O wireless but works with AT&T;, T-mobile and Telcel.I did a lot of review reading with this and other phones also watched several video reviews and even a \"Xperia Crash Test\" video LOLdon't know if this phone is really that strong but it sure is awesome phone awesome deal.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "a very functional phone", "Author": "Reinaldo Landaeta", "ReviewID": "RKNQU4DJ61UTF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "efficient, fast, sleek, slim, the screen super! is a very functional phone, connected to social networks facebook, instagram, twitter, google, has a unique 8-megapixel camera, radio, walkman, the high-fidelity headphones like all sony equipment, excellent!!", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Luis A.
