This new Motorola really surprises me. Very sharp looking and quality build. Qwerty keys are rubberized as is the rear panel, which gives it a quality feel. It's thin like the galaxy, reminds me of my blackberry curve--just a little more compact. I have a hearing loss...earpiece was good and speakerphone was fine...not quite as dynamic as the galaxy or blackberry...but works fine. Nice 2mg camera, fm radio and MP3 player.

I currently own a Galaxy SII and have owned Blackberrys so I have a pretty good knowledge base in terms of cell phones. For $40 this is an excellent texting, picture messaging, and voice phone. The camera and display were better than I expected, and the keyboard really surpassed my expectations. The keyboard is just a notch under Blackberry and surprisingly better than android keyboards such as the droid pro. Overall a great phone for someone who doesn't need advanced functioning.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing for the price", "Author": "CoastingOregon", "ReviewID": "R2B1WXJT5EBSHJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone locally because it was on sale for $29.99 with an additional 10% senior discount on the first Tuesday of the month. $26.99 was very good for a pretty good phone with double minutes for life. I transferred minutes and activation from a broken phone by talking to the best Tracfone tech support guy I've ever spoken with. That's not been a common experience at Tracfone. It took a couple of tries because it did not want to transfer more than about half my minutes on the first try.The phone:1) good sound in phone mode2) full qwerty keyboard has tiny keys of course and tiny letters/numbers for the keys. The feel is fine and it works pretty well. Correcting mistakes in an IM is easy and intuitive with the backspace key. Number pad is in the middle of the qwerty letters and so it is extra busy and a bit fussy. Not bad but not for the visually impaired either. Without my reading glasses it would be a pain.3) IMs are amazingly simple to create with the qwerty keyboard and for a touch typist far more intuitive than the various phone-pad styles of texting. This is one of the main reasons I selected this model4) Installing the SD card is a cinch following the tutorial on the Tracfone site (you have to search for the model # because Tracfone doesn't acknowledge this phone in their listings by photo).5) radio reception is not great. Playing music on a 16GB microSD card is not bad at all.6) Annoyance: This kind of phone is nonsensical as a web browser. I won't use that feature so I am annoyed no end that the default setting of one of the two main buttons is to select \"browser.\" I have already trained myself not to use that button from the start menu, but it is a pain that one cannot simply disable that feature.Another user gave some instructions for using the memory card. I'll fill in some blanks:Tracfone and lots of websites want you to pay for ringtones and do not tell you how to download your own ringtones for free. It's remarkably easy once you know the tricks. Follow the instructions on the Tracfone tutorial site for installing a microSD memory card (google for EX431g tutorial and you'll find it). Then plug your microUSB cable (extra charge--$6 for cable and a two USB port charger from Amazon) into the phone and to a USB port on your computer. Choose \"mass storage\" from the phone's menu when it detects the cable. Copy a ringtone mp3 (midi probably works too) to the memory card using your computer's file manager. I made a \"Ringtones\" folder using my computer's file manager so I could keep the tones separate from music I plan to load. When you've copied over the ringtones to the ringtone folder unplug the usb cable. From the phone's menu system choose the My Folder icon (between the camera and the multimedia icons). Select it and then choose \"SD card\" and \"open\" and you will see your ringtone folder that you made on the SD card. Select the folder and choose \"open\" and you will see the names of the ringtones. Choose one of these and select \"Use as\" and \"incoming call\" and you have set your mp3 as your ringtone.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Little Champ from Motorola", "Author": "Bill P", "ReviewID": "R3C1QEAHVUAVL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace a smartphone that was costing a ton each month.  I wanted three things in a new phone: keyboard and call quality, long battery life, and large mp3 capacity.  The EX431 delivered my expectations, and far more.First, the call quality is amazing.  I forget I'm on a cell sometimes.  I don't know how much of that is due to T-Mobile, but this phone has crystal-clear calls. For texting, the keyboard is more than adequate, and the keys have a rubberized finish that's nice to the touch.  The software for texting is a little less than intuitive, you have to learn to get used to the phone's menu-based texting functionality.  Once you do, it's no big deal.Second, this battery life could give the Energizer bunny a run for his money.  I can listen to mp3's at work all day, and use maybe 20% of the battery.  My old smartphone had to get a pick-me-up charge during the day just to make it through, and then a nightly charge.  On standby, the phone will last for 6+ days.Third, mp3 capability.  This phone really delivers as an mp3 player.  Using decent Sony earbuds, I get near-Walkman sound quality, including some decent bass.  The phone has equalizer settings, so you can adjust the sound within limits to your liking. Where the phone really shines is the player software.  The included Media Player has a Now Playing feature, that you can set to randomly choose files to play.  You must first index your music, (Media Player | Refresh Library).  It takes about 10 minutes to index 3700 mp3's.  Once indexed, set the shuffle mode (Media Player | Settings | Player Settings | Shuffle = ON).  The phone accepts up to a 32GB micro SDHC card, I added a 32GB cheapo card from Micro Center to my phone, and it worked without a hitch in the Motorola.  Some reviewers report adding a 32GB card doesn't work, but likely they did not FORMAT the card after adding it (My Folder | chip name | Options - Format).  Once the card is in, you can directly hook the phone's USB to your computer, and the Motorola will pop a USB config screen up.  Choose \"Mass storage\" for you PC to recognize it as an external drive.Internet browsing is not this phone's forte, it has a limited ability to work with mobile sites.  I can check my webmail with it, but it's painful to try to read it on the small screen.  Text entry fields are non-intuitive, you have to cursor to them and hit the center button, and a menu will come up to allow you to type text in the web page field.To conclude, after a month with the phone, I have no regrets and I'm convinced I got a good deal on a great phone. If smartphones and web browsing aren't for you, you'll be well served with this little champ from Motorola.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone, but can only send tiny photos.", "Author": "Truthseeker \"artist\"", "ReviewID": "R315LV267YGES7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone and have Tracfone service through T-Mobile.  Everything is fine with this phone and the sound quality is comparable to a landline, which is much better than my former Motorola W376 phone that had ATT as its carrier.  Even the small qwerty keyboard is fun, and I dial numbers with my eyes closed from the sense of touch.  The big problem for me, since I love to take photos and send them to either other people or an e-mail, is that it will only send postage stamp photos, about 1 1/2 inches by 1 inch.  The phone's largest size is 2 mb, and if sent to another phone, it is shrunk to 1 mb and will not open up to fill the screen.  Same with e-mail.  I kept thinking, they've got to be kidding.  This is a joke.  The former W376 would send a small image to e-mail, but then open up to a large enough picture to be viewed and printed as a 4 x 6 print.  So, I don't if it's my phone, or T-Mobile stinks.  Tracfone tech support was unable to help, so there's no solution.

I liked the feel and the pronounced buttons but that's where it stopped. The phone has no ringers to choose from. There are 15 different tunes that you can choose from. The volume is lacking and can only be heard in a couple choices. If you want the phone to ring, that's not an option. It only lets you play little bits of corny music. Strike 2 was when I remove it to use it and even though it was set to lock buttons after 30 seconds they would be found unlocked minutes later. It felt thin and I was hoping I could make it work but even after choosing the loudest song and the highest volume I was missing calls because it couldn't be heard. I returned it and bought an LG840G.

It's a great size and fits comfortably in an average woman's pants, front or back pocket. My previous Nokia phone was 10x better though than this Motorola (despite the Nokia being only $15 more). Here's are my issues with this Motorola phone:1st: The camera might be 2mp, but the photos can't be used for anything. The camera lets you decide if you use a Wallpaper photo shoot mode, VGA, 1MP or 2MP when you take a photo, but regardless of which mode is selected, the photos taken cannot be used for the profile photos in the phone's address book. Why? Because the pics are \"too large\". Also, try texting a photo of any size (VGA up to 2mp) and the recipient will only receive a thumb tack size photo (even if they have a Smart Phone). Why? Because this Motorola phone automatically resizes your image down before sending it to your recipient. And they can't enlarge it or do anything to make the photo 'viewable' to determine what the photo is actually of. This camera is useless. Maybe if you spend the air minutes to email it to yourself you'll get to use the image???2nd: If I am typing a text message, and hold down the delete/back button for a couple seconds in order to edit a line of the text: it will delete the entire message without warning. Each unwanted character must be deleted one at a time.3rd: There is one pop-up box that comes up every time I unlock the phone saying that it is unlocked. A different pop-up box appears whenever I send a text, access internet, and make or receive a call. It tells me how many minutes I have left, but... when the same info is permanently posted on the phone's \"home wallpaper screen\", then why do we need a pop up box too??  Sometimes the box takes 3 to 4 seconds before it goes away, other times pressing another button will get rid of it. Sometimes. I just want to do what I want with my phone without waiting through every pop up box.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible Phone. Awful.

I ordered on and it is not really a tracfone for the United States.  It was some Telcel America phone, which is not a cellular service that I've ever even heard of nor is it offered in either of the states I've lived in.  The box, packaging and instructions were all written in Spanish.  Not sure what is going on, but the whole thing seems very fishy.  I'm extremely disappointed in Amazon.com for letting this stuff happen.  When I ordered this phone, I verified that it was fulfilled by Amazon thinking that provided some safety.  Boy was I wrong.  If you are thinking of ordering this phone, I would definitely look around or try to call Amazon first.  Otherwise, you might end up with a phone that isn't really a tracfone that you can use.
