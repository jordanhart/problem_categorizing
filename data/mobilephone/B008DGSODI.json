{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Quick review of the Epic 4g Touch", "Author": "ED", "ReviewID": "R1ZHHKPIUU5GFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "- Updated 10/19/11 -This is by far the best phone I have ever used. My previous phone is a EVO 4g so luckily i got renewed after a year.This is my own personal review based on experiences with my EVO 4g, my friends's ip4 and this Epic 4g touch.By far, Epic 4g touch wins by a mile.Initial impressions:1. Its light as hell!!!!! it feels like you're holding a toy or a dummy phone (this may be good or bad depending on the user, it's really good for me)2. The size is good enough for me but then again it depends on how big your hands are.3. The colors are very very VERY vibrant, it really stands out from all angles.4. It is silky smooth, SILKY SMOOTH. the OS has no lag at all, i tried a pinch to zoom test for the ip4 and epic 4g touch and surprisingly, the epic 4g is so much better.5. Video camera is on par if not better with Ip4.6. Touchwiz has a lot of nice functions and the widgets are very nice.7. Battery life is not too bad, i can go a day without having to recharge.8. Probably one of my top compliments of the phone, the kies air app is well thought out and wonderfully done. It helps a lot with deleting and transferring stuff to your phone.9. The screen is not a fingerprint magnet.10. It is so thin, i'm afraid to hold it in my hand cause it feels like i'm going to drop it (also due to its lightweight)11. No need to really do any customization cause the widgets work well and they look very nice.12. Touchwiz provides a power widget which is very useful: It goes according to this: wifi- bluetooth-gps-brightness-settings-sync-screentime out-tips (toggle off and on)13. They have a widget for \"active applications\", this is like a task killer app that you would find in the market. Very easy to use, helps exit all apps if needed, also shows you all your download apps so you can uninstall  them if you wish.14. When you're charging the phone, once it its 100%, it will give out a beep letting you it's done.15. When you're calling and you unlock your phone, the notification bar turns neon green (which i think is pretty cool)16. Sprint will be the only carrier with an notification led on the front.17. Battery life update: From 1% to 100% charge, it takes about 2 hours, 45 minutes. Last night, I charged it to 99%. I watched a 5 minute youtube video then went to sleep. Work up, went to work at 9am to 2pm. Mobile was on with my IMO (messaging program) the entire time. Surfed the web, checked email and returned a few text (This is also with live wallpaper on). By the time it was 7PM, the battery had hit 1%. Total hours on battery life was about 20 hours. So yes, the battery to me is very good but each to their own.Now for the cons:1. the touch buttons are not as sensitive as the EVO 4g touch. You would have to hit it directly with little error margin to get it right.2. The charging cable is very short.3. I'm not sure if the camera on the back is touching the surface when its laid on its back.4. No dedicated flashlight app however this can be downloaded from the market.5. The power button is located on the right side, the volume rocker is on the left side. Sometimes i hit the rocker volume while trying to hit the power button however i just need more practice.6. When charging and placed on a flat surface , the touch sensor lags, this only happens when its charging.7. The touch sensitive buttons have white led light and you can control the duration however the options are given to you at a max of 6 seconds or \"always on\", they could have given us the option of letting us create our own duration.8. No dedicated battery app however you can download it in the market.9. Dock icons can't be replaced (maybe it can and i just don't know it?) UPDATE: it can be replaced except the apps icon.10. Not sure if this is a con for me yet but when you want to make a call, you would have to swipe . So there is 2 ways of calling: (1) you hit the call button, hit the log button, click the contact, then click on call. (clicking on the contact is what im more use to) and (2) you hit the call button, hit the log button and you swipe right on the contact to call.11. Kies Air can only transfer 100mb or less to your phone.-Coming from Evo 4g, i'm use to having the home button on the far left where as the epic 4g touch is located on the 2nd button.13. Speakers are located on the bottom back which makes it weak if the phone is flat on the surface.Again, most of the things listed above is from my own personal experience and maybe some may feel the same way.Here are some tips i found:1. You can take a screen shot of your phone, just hold the power + home button at the same time and let go.2. When listening to the stock music player or if somebody is calling, you can flip the phone so the front screen is on the bottom to mute.3. You can uninstall most of the sprint store apps.4. to save battery, i usually turn off auto sync.5. when you're at the call log, you can swipe left to message the person, or swipe right to call the person.6. You can create folders7. If you use stock browser, you can switch windows by pinching in. fingers should start from.the top and bottom. You heard.it here first. Enjoy.8. When somebody is calling you, you have 3 options (1) Pick up (2) decline (3) swipe up and a menu will pop up with text messages to send to the person such as \"I am driving\". All you hvae to do is click send. Very useful and handy!9. You can only transfer 100mb maximum on kies air.10. You tube and music still plays with the screen off.11. May want to get class 6 for.microsd, I was told it would lag a bit accessing files. Such as opening gallery.12.  Sometimes I hit the EN (swype keyboard) on accident and it turns to ES  english to spanish). To turn this off hold on the EN key and uncheck ES.Overall, i would recommend this phone to everybody I know. This is the best phone out in the market today and yes i know, nexus prime and ip5 is coming out but honestly, this phone is so good that i would say it would be on par with them and it's not because of spec but also because of design. It looks physically sexy. I honestly would say this can be an \"iDroid\" Haha, the reason i say this is because its taken the smoothness of the iOS and the customization of the android system and merged it together to become one. THIS PHONE is what all phones should be, the only reason not to get this phone is the size if it's not good enough for you otherwise, this phone should make a lot of people happy.Update (1)As far as GPS and wifi signal goes, I haven't had any loss signals YET.  Also, the slight lag with the lock screen seems to be related to the microsd card installed. Once i've taken the card out, the lag decreases.Update (2)I have figured what the problem is when there is lag while charging. It has to do with the charger itself, the usb connector is fine. I have a car charger and noticed when i was charging, there was no lag at all. So i went home and tried charging it with the OEM charger that was in the box, there was lag, the touch was not registering correctly. I decided to switch the charger to another one (i'm using the power charger from my HP Touchpad) and I'm not experiencing any lag at all. I hope this helps, ya heard it here first! 10/4/11Update (3  more tips1. Seen this one with iphone and i never got time to play around with the camera on s2 however there is a panorama option which is quite awesome!2. With the stock email client, if you pinch in, it will sort all your emails by the date.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Absolutely blown away by this phone!", "Author": "Michael B. Magnet \"Tech enthusiast/pharmacist...", "ReviewID": "RQND8M10IXL2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone the day it was released via overnight shipping and have been using it ever since (about a week now)- I have been utterly impressed with the device! I switched from a rather dated and rooted original Motorola Droid on Verizon and I couldn't be happier.Pros:-The Super AMOLED (Active matrix organic light emitting diode), which is the newest kind of display technology, absolutely blows any other display away in terms of contrast and color saturation. The 4.5'' diagonal screen on this beast is an absolute pleasure to look at, and it's more efficient than an LCD to boot! I've read a lot of reviews whining about the marginally lower resolution on this screen compared to qHD screens; what a joke, this screen makes every other device around it look washed out and dated... dead serious- you'll completely forget about resolution the moment you power it up- and it has far superior response times!-Processor- underneath the gorgeous screen lies a beast of a processor, a dual core 1.2ghz Samsung Exynos CPU that really packs a punch. As everyone has said, it seems that nothing currently available can slow this thing down. Coupled with the CPU is a discrete Mali 400 GPU (video card for you non-geeks), which affords this phone the ability to have the smoothest, most buttery user-interface experience I've seen on any phone to date. You'll be extremely pleased how effortlessly the phone shifts between any task you're doing to the next one, without any hiccups.... the phone has literally not stuttered once for me in the almost entire week I've been using it. Widgets also run great and contrary to what some users have said, I've not had one crash yet and the phone executes them with ease.-Cameras- With an 8mp rear camera and 2mp front camera, as well as the ability to capture 1080p video, this phone is very impressive in terms of image capturing ability. Of course, it's not gong to replace your high end Nikon or Canon, but you'll be asking yourself if the photos/videos you shoot were really taken with a smart phone- it's that good!-Call/speaker quality- Calls on this phone sound top notch and I honestly can't notice a difference between it and my girlfriend's Droid Bionic in terms of calling. Admittedly, at higher volumes the external speaker on the Epic Touch 4G sounds a bit tinny compared to the Bionic, but who cares when you have such a sleek, light, and sexy device- it makes the Bionic feel clunky by comparison.-Case size/feel- I'm tired of hearing about people whining about how this phone \"feels cheap\". What does that even mean? Samsung has obviously gone out of their way to use high end composite materials to make this phone as thin and light as possible, and to me it feels like the future- other heavier phones feel clunky and dated by comparison. Unless you're a bumbling idiot that routinely drops 600 dollar devices on the concrete, ignore this immaterial critique and try out the feel for yourself.... the airy, sexy lightweight feel of the phone fits perfectly with its blazing speed and gorgeous display- it's like you're using something out of Star Trek.Battery Life- This phone has fantastic battery life and as far as I know comes packed with the largest battery of any phone currently available (1800 mAh). It easily makes it through a day of normal use even with GPS turned on, although 4G connectivity does make the battery drain considerably faster. To their credit, Samsung has engineered the phone such that the 4G network will go into \"sleep\" mode displaying a \"Zzz\" icon in the 4G status area when you aren't sending/receiving data to help conserve battery life.Space- with 16gb of onboard memory plus support for up to a 32gb microSD card, you'll have plenty of space to carry around basically whatever you want on your phone (most people with older phones already have a compatible microSD card they can just pop in to it as well)4G connectivity- When you can get signal, this feature is great. Sure, the coverage isn't nearly as good as Verizon's LTE network and the speed isn't quite as fast, but it's still a huge step up from 3G and for a power user like me, the ability to have unlimited data on Sprint is a huge win. I live in the Piedmont Triad area of North Carolina and get great 4G coverage overall near Greensboro and Winston Salem as well as Kernersville, and websites/apps load/download almost instantly on the Wimax network. I've been really pleased and impressed with the coverage overall and the price of the plan is awesome at 79 bucks a month.Cons:-The large size of the phone may be a con for some people, but I absolutely love it and think it's a perfect size (I'm 6'4 with larger hands, however)-The Touchwiz interface is so-so.... I'm a pharmacy manager with a busy schedule and get slightly annoyed at the Calendar widget it comes with as it doesn't break out tasks that well for me-The Sprint Network- overall, I'm very pleased with the network (I was a bit scared about coverage coming from Verizon) at the price point and the fact that I have unlimited everything with the phone. If you're looking for the absolute best coverage, however, stay with Verizon- but you'll get killed if you eat up a lot of data or send a lot of texts. In my opinion, if you live near one of the 4G covered cities, Sprint is hands down the way to go for heavy data users.-The update frequency of the OS is yet to be seen, but this has been an issue with Samsung in the past- hoping they'll get it right this time around!In summary, this is an EXCELLENT device that I would recommend to anyone, unless you have absolutely tiny hands and are confused by the 4 button interface of Android (ha ha... I love the classic complaints about Android). I honestly feel like the iPhone 5 will be lucky if it can even attain an on-par status with the amazing user experience the Epic Touch 4G delivers.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R76X5HKWGOQWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this phone on the 16th.  Here are a few things that I like and dislike:likes:1. speed2. screen3. build (feels like a toy? are you kidding me?) this phone is so light in weight but don't confuse that as a poor build quality.  If you want a phone built like a tank and weighs like one by all means choose a different phone.  finish and fit are beautifully done!4. camera (8m + LED flash). The pictures are sharp and focused.  I like using retro camera and little photo.  Even the front camera is awesome.5. Gingerbread is cool and stable (no force close so far)6. Google integration.  Flawless7. GOOD and corporate email integration.  Flawless8. GPS and Google Map.  works perfectly.9. audio (had to adjust the EQ to make it right)I'm rockin'10. wifi (works great)11. print Screen!!!! yes!! (home+power) finally!12. cold boot time... fast (this is handy when you change out the battery and power back up fast)13. SD card expansion up to 16G (I have 8Gb in mine.. no delays)14. changeable battery.. awesome.dislikes:1. slippery surface (I need to get a case so that I can grip this thing without slipping out of my hand)2. size (I have a pretty big hands (6' tall) but I sometimes need to use both hands.. perhaps due to the slipperiness of the phone) but my wife has small hands but she is not complaining... so try it out.  The benefit of the size is the screen but... I'd rather have a little smaller phone than a little bigger screen. (but that's me)3. power button on the size opposite of the volume rocker is annoying if you are trying to power on with your left hand.  try it out.4. a little delay in \"wake up time\"... once again... a little annoying.5. compare to iphone 4 the touch screen is a little choppier, but does not diminish the user experience.Summary:This phone works like it should and more.  This is definitely a fun and exciting phone.  My dislikes are mostly user experience and can be subjective.  But... that's what I've noticed so far with this phone.

I have had no problems at all with the EVO. I previously purchased the EVO 3D then I caught wind of all the talk about the Galaxy SII coming to the USA so I returned it and waited. It was a very hard wait because I was ready for an upgrade but I am so glad I did!This phone is awesome. I have never owned a Samsung phone and therefore have never had the apparently horrible experience of TouchWhiz past but the interface is great on TouchWhiz 4! You can't go wrong with the huge screen, beautiful Super Amoled Plus display and the crazy fast Exynos 1.2 Dual core processor. I can't list all of the pros of this phone but one HUGE thing for me is that the phone has 16 gigs of internal storage and an SD slot. I keep all of my pictures and videos on the phone drive and my music on the SD card. I LOVE the fact that I have instant thumbnails for my videos and pictures as soon as I click on the Gallery app. Excellent cell, WiFi, and 4G reception too!I would highly recommend this phone!", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "FIrst Android Phone, \"Lovin' it\"", "Author": "Anthony Tran", "ReviewID": "R1XBLQSUE6PQWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some people are getting this phone mixed up with the Epic 4G.

If you would like to review the issues history, read on; if not, jump down to the 1/15 updateOn paper - this phone is amazing. And in many ways it is. The screen is brilliant (and surprisingly manageable given its large size). The CPU is fast. The AMOLED technology delivers an incredibly vivid image, AND (theoretically) saves battery power, because 'black' pixels are un-lit, and thus require no power.BUT HERE's THE RUBFollow my analogy - Let's say you bought a BMW 6-series for $85K or so; beautiful design and engineering, specifications to die for. So you get into your new car, and find that with every few miles of driving, the engine suddenly, and randomly, shuts itself down.Now, while scratching your head on this problem, you're looking at your gas gauge and expensive on-board computer and it's telling you that you have about 400 miles left. You drive 150 miles and guess what: you're out of gas.I'll close my analogy now: you call BMW, and despite all of the other 6's that are on the side of the road with the same problem, BMW won't recognize the issue. Instead, the recommend for problem (a) to disconnect and reconnect your battery whenever this happens, and for problem (b),  perhaps carry a little spare gas with you.Translated:Despite its rich feature set, and some engineering marvel, this phone suffers from serious issues; the most serious is known as the \"LOS issue\" or Loss of Service, wherein the radio randomly shuts itself off, and cannot be turned on without a battery pull - and that's once you're aware it's off after missing how many calls? Not to be confused with the other LOS issue, Loss of Signal, wherein your Samsung has one bar (or has started roaming) and your buddy (on Sprint w/a different phone) has 4 bars. Not clear whether the two LOS issues are related.The second issue is MASSIVE unexplainable battery drain. Theoretically this phone should get - and many people do achieve, 20-30 hours of battery life per charge. Heck, it's one of the reasons I waited 8 months for this phone (they announced it in Feb. 2011). I, and many others, get 5-10 hours per charge, max.  Nobody's quite sure why, but the latest thinking is that some out of control processes prevent the phone from 'sleeping' when it's not being used, resulting in diminished battery life. The first issue may in fact be a contributor to the second.Too much detail to provide here, but if you're seriously considering this phone, check out the XDA Developers forum, or any other popular Android forum, search on 'AOS issue' and/or 'LOS issue' and you'll see what I mean.And here's what discourages me most - Samsung/Sprint will not even recognize the issues, as (many have theorized) they are astutely aware, but either don't know what's causing the problem, or don't care (even the Sprint Forum is clogged with complaints and no word from Sprint). To be clear - not ALL phones seem to be experiencing this, but MANY are. Roll the dice if you like.I'm writing this review because I had to find out about these issues - and all of these forums - AFTER I bought the phone, and perhaps I can save some of you that issue.<<UPDATE 10/24>>Seems that a lot of frustrated owners are venting in the Sprint forums, but people who don't own the phone yet typically don't go there. If you're reading this and you don't own the phone yet, you should check out the owners forums. If you DO own the phone and are having these issues, please post your personal experience in a separate review here on Amazon (the many comments to this post are great, but will not get as much attention as an independent post/review.) Thanks!<<UPDATE 1/15/2012>>After far too many delays, Sprint/Samsung has released firmware fixes that are intended to address the major issues mentioned in this review. I have had the opportunity to evaluate these, even before they were made public, thanks in large part to the great developer community at XDA Forums.Above I stated that I can now endorse this phone under certain circumstances, and those are that the purchaser's phone contain the necessary fixes. At this time I do not know if these have been 'pushed' over-the-air to all existing users, if they are by default being included in new phones, or if one has to wait for the issues to occur and then have to waste time with Sprint Support to get the update.There is an easy way to determine if any phone you are considering has been updated. If you are in a Sprint Store, you can follow the instructions below. If the phone meets the requirements, congratulations - you now own what may be the finest mass-market device produced to date. If not, tell them to pull another one from stock, or take your chances by learning how to root your phone and updating it yourself.HOW TO DETERMINE ROM/KERNEL/MODEM UPDATE TO LOOK FOR:1) With the phone at its Home Screen, press the <Menu> softkey. Select <Settings>.2) Scroll down the next screen and select <About Phone>.3) On this page, scroll down and confirm the following:  -  \"Baseband Version\" (this is the modem): Should have a series of numbers and letters. At the end of this series, make sure you see 'EL13' 'EL26' or 'EL29'.  If you see 'EG30' 'EG12' or 'EG31', then RUN AWAY.  - \"Kernel Version\" (this is the OS): Should also have a series of numbers, beginning with 2.6.3X.X- etc. In the middle of this series, you'll want to see 'EK02' 'EL13' 'EL26' or 'EL29'.  - \"Build Number\" (this is the ROM version): Since my device is rooted with a custom ROM, I don't know the exact wording of the 'default'. However, if you see any of the recommended codes from <Kernel Version> above somewhere in this description, then you're in good shape, because the ROM that's loaded determines the kernel version (not necessarily vice-versa).NOW - Enjoy this device - it's pretty amazing!", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone, but watch out for surprise charges from Sprint when ordering from Amazon", "Author": "Prospero424", "ReviewID": "ROUU78I9Q57VP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*WATCH OUT FOR UNDISCLOSED $36 \"DEVICE UPGRADE FEE\" FOR THIS PHONE ON YOUR SPRINT BILL WITH CONTRACT EXTENSIONS*Got this phone here about a month ago and I'm loving it.  The large screen is a big plus for me as I'm in the IT business and having a device that I can actually use remote desktop on in a pinch can be a lifesaver.  Easily fits in all of my pockets.  Good size for my hand; when holding it vertically I can perform all functions without having to use both hands.FAST fast fast is all I have to say about the performance. Probably the quickest phone I've ever used.  I can't wait until they get Android 4.0 released for it.Camera takes very good pictures and video camera WAY outperformed my expectations. The flash is also the brightest I've seen on any mobile phone.Anyway, I've got it set up as an FTP client, SMB client, VNC/RDP client, DLNA client, Exchange and IMAP client, and even as a Sharepoint client.  I can't believe it ALL works flawlessly! Combine this with the Dolphin HD browser and LastPass for password/form-fill management and you've got mobile computing bliss.Battery life is even better for this model than other Galaxy S II models due to the Epic 4G Touch's larger battery (for WiMax support).  If you don't constantly use 4G, it will last even longer than the other models will.  I've been getting 20-24 hours of above-normal to heavy use.4G (WiMax) speeds are much better than I was expecting.  I'm seeing real-world speeds of 5-15Mbps down and 1.5Mbps up.  Very nice.Only two major complaints:1.  There is a known bug where if you encrypt both the phone and the (internal) SD card, it disables satellite GPS functionality completely.  It will not function at all.  This occurs on every phone of this model with the current firmware.  Samsung is, I'm sure, working on the problem but not being able to encrypt is a BIG deal for those of us who need to use it for work.2.  Not a complaint about the phone itself, but Sprint adds an (as far as I can tell) undisclosed $36 \"Device Upgrade Fee\" to your Sprint bill after purchasing it from Amazon Wireless.  If it was somehow disclosed during the purchasing process, it must have been in REALLY fine print because I'm not the sort who just scans through.  I actually read this stuff.[BEGIN RANT]Now, calling it an \"upgrade fee\" is simply false labeling.  This fee has nothing to do with recouping the cost of activation or the clerical process of moving a customer's services from one device to another.  No, this is not mere supposition on my part. Sprint representatives will tell you up-front (as they did when I called to complain) when confronted about this fee that it's there to \"help make their phones' pricing more competitive\".  So essentially what they're doing is using this as a way to advertise one price publicly while actually charging the customer a higher price than what was advertised.  There is no argument in the world - ESPECIALLY having spoken to a Sprint representative on the phone who confirmed this - that this is not a deliberately deceptive business practice.  It is unacceptable, and if I didn't already sign a 2-year contract I would have walked out on Sprint over it.  No one should tolerate what are manifestly deliberate hidden and obscured fees/costs.The real kicker here is that Sprint will wave the fee if you purchase the phone through THEIR store (at a higher price than Amazon, of course), but not if you purchased it through Amazon Wireless.  I've seen this confirmed by multiple people on multiple forums.  Amazon Wireless should be more than a bit peeved by this.  I sure am.So anyway, to sum up: BUYER BEWARE when it comes to Sprint.  If they're willing to deliberately deceive customers in this regard, perhaps they're willing to do it in other areas, as well.  Keep a close eye on your bill.[END RANT]So it's a fantastic phone.  Probably the best hardware currently available.  Even the Galaxy Nexus is getting beaten by it fairly handily in most benchmarks.  Once the (rather major) GPS bug is squashed and once it gets Ice Cream Sandwich, it'll be a dream.  It's too bad Sprint had to spoil the good time with behavior than ONLY a company with an army of lawyers could get away with.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Style + Substance = Samsung Epic 4G Touch", "Author": "Alex Sanchez", "ReviewID": "R2F855JHNIESIP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone on friday 9/16 when it was just released. I was at the Best Buy Mobile store in our local mall bright and early to make sure I would get one and lucky thing since they only got 2 units in for the release (strange)....two weeks earlier I had purchased an HTC EVO 3D at Best Buy and was immediately looking for a replacement. The screen quality was lacking, the 3D looked very gimmicky, and the camera was pretty pathetic. Other than those shortcomings, the EVO 3D was decent but not what I would expect from a high end smart-phone. After some research I discovered that the Samsung Galaxy II was going to be released in the US soon so I bided my time.The GS2 was not in the store when I got there since the FedEx shipment had not yet arrived. It gave me quite some time to talk to the VERY knowledgeable salesman (thanks for all the info Jonathan Mosblech) who proceeded to demo many of the other phones they carried including his own Motorola Photon. Jonathan described the different features, compared specs, and weighed the pros and cons of each device. Before we knew it, 1 1/2 hours had gone by when FedEx finally showed up. Jonathan unboxed it for me and proceeded with the initial setup.The first thing that jumped out at us was the size. Sitting next to my old EVO it looked like a monster. But then I picked it up and was shocked with how light it was in comparison. It was also very thin! The design was sleek and sexy, and the poor EVO looked like an unsightly brick sitting next to it. This was only my second Android phone I have ever owned so I left it to Jonathan to look it over and give me the run down. He looked like a kid in a candy store. The more we played around with it the more impressed he seemed. The screen is absolutely gorgeous and it played everything we through at it with ease. The camera took amazingly sharp  pictures and smooth high quality 1080p video. He loaded SPB Shell 3D on it and the UI was so fluid and responsive. He also downloaded an app called Quadrant Standard which is a utility that runs benchmark tests and compares the data to other phones. He just about flipped when he saw how the GS2 massively outperformed the other phones. (Score: 3324). In the end, Jonathan was trying to figure out how many of his phones he was going to have to trade in to get his own Samsung Galaxy SII. Since he spends all day working with phones and I am new to the Android market, I accepted his assessment that this was currently the best phone he's seen on the mark to date.Its been almost a full week since I got the phone and my only real complaint is that the reception is just a tad bit less than that of the HTC EVO 3D. I notice it because I have always had bad reception at my house and the calls break-up just a little more with this phone. Battery life is also less and the power management utility shows that the screen is the majority consumer (like most phones). The phone reception is still very good and in my opinion, the lesser battery life (lasts me about 18 hours with plenty of use) is well worth the trade-off.One more thing than makes this phone great for me is the wireless syncing system called Kies air. Its about damn time that smartphones have become completely untethered devices. And you don't even need to load software on your computer to sync.

Others may be put off, as I was, by reports of bad reception and poor battery life.  I am glad to say that a week and a half in, I have had the same excellent reception I had with my prior phone (also a Samsung, the Instinct) and the battery life has been good.  I've never had to recharge during the day, though I have on a couple of occasions with heavy data usage gone below 50% when the phone goes into power saving mode.  No Loss of Service or Sleep of Death issues, which is what I feared.  It's early days, but I am glad that I wasn't daunted by the negative reviews.I've been on the Sprint network a long time--at least in my area, it offers better coverage and the everything plan is great for me as I am a heavy data user.  I was eagerly awaiting the debut of the iPhone on Sprint, and did actually have an iPhone 4s briefly before replacing it with the Samsung.  The iPhone is a fantastic phone, but I did not like the fact that  Sprint's usual insurance couldn't be purchased for the iPhone so no coverage for loss or theft.  Also, I don't like iTunes, and I wished for a larger screen.  To be honest, I think the iPhone screen has better resolution, but the Samsung is easier to read with the 4.5 in screen, and it does show photos and videos well.  Cameras seem comparable.  My 24 hours with the iPhone did make me realize the genius of Apple product design, though.  It feels good in your hand.  The bigger, slimmer Samsung is more slippery and less solid feeling.

All had their own specific issues and all 3 also had issues that were the same between them.  I'd like to add that all were kept in a case and were in MINT condition.  No scratches, no marks, etc.  I don't abuse phones.  The S2 was my work phone.- Charger port is junk.  #2 and #3 had issues with it coming loose and not charging.  This isn't the first phone I've had with a USB charger, but the only one that the port would do this.- Screen is fragile.  I literally set phone #2 on my desk, dropped back first from about 12\".  Nice crack along the bottom of the screen.  To show how big of a piece of crap to a co-worker, the old 3GS personal phone I had at the time I tossed across my office, hit my fridge and not a mark on it.  At least half of our office had cracked screens.- Phone #1 would randomly overheat (and heavily drain the battery at the same time).- Phone #1 and #2 would have random reboots.- Phone #2 couldn't be hard reset.- All three phones (and everyone in my company that had one which is a lot of people) had issues with it randomly no longer sending or receiving data or cell service.  All looks good, all Aps work fine, but anything that required data (whether on wifi or cell) or anything cellular releated would just stop working and you would have to reboot the phone.  I usually noticed it after not getting any calls or text messages for a while.The last issue is why my company dropped every single S2 we had and replaced them with iPhone 4S phones instead.  Same crappy Sprint service but not nearly the issues we used to have.I wouldn't suggest the S2 to anyone.  Everyone I spoke to that had the S2 was very glad to get rid of this piece of junk.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone But Not Without It's Issues", "Author": "Sleepy", "ReviewID": "RQPLVAFTE2K5C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Samsung Galaxy SII Epic Touch 4G is the unnecessary and somewhat confusing name for this device considering there is a phone just called the \"Epic 4G\" which is the Samsung Galaxy S for Sprint (and also has a touch screen). Anyway, enough about the name.The phone is, as you have probably heard, great. It's true. However, there are some things I didn't find enjoyable about owning it, so here's an easy to read pros and cons list.PROS-Super AMORLED Screen: the screen is super bright and clear. When I went to look at a similar Samsung phone for AT&T; with this screen I was like a moth to a street light. The screen on the S2 is just as good.-4.52-inch Display: this goes along with the last point, but deserves it's own mention. The screen is huge. I've had a lot of people comment on that. You may not like this feature about the phone if you like small devices, but it is nice looking.-Fast Processor: everything about the phone itself is fast, considering you have a strong internet connection. There is hardly ever any lag when it is working correctly.-Camera: the camera takes nice pictures and has flash. There are also some cool settings like panorama or cartoon that you can mess around with. For a phone camera it is very good. There is also a front facing camera for pictures and video, but the quality isn't great.-Video: I felt I had to mention this separately because I was blown away by the quality of the videos that this phone takes. They are amazing and can be recorded in everything up to 1920x1080 resolution. It's something you have to see for yourself.CONS-Low Resolution: the phone has a meager resolution of 800x480. This is something I didn't think of before getting the phone because I hadn't had a chance to look at it is person. In general, it really detracts from the overall quality of the display with the low resolution. Considering other phones that were out before the S2 have better resolutions, this shouldn't have even been an issue.-Low Battery Life: the battery life sucks, probably due in part to the aforementioned huge display. That thing love to suck up battery life whenever it isn't in sleep mode. I found that a good way to save battery if you are planning on keeping the phone in your pocket for a long period of time (in class or whatever) is to just turn the 3G data off. Then you use virtually no battery until you take it out of sleep mode.-Service Issues: I'm not sure if this is the fault of Sprint or the phone, but sometimes I will lose service and never get it back. The screen will have that \"no service\" symbol at the top, and it will just say \"searching for service\". Even when I go somewhere with service, it won't come back. I have to actually turn my phone off and turn it back on to get it back, at which point I will find out I missed calls and texts.OTHER-Phone Design: I put this in this section because some people like it and some people hate it. The phone itself is very light and has a \"cheap\" plastic feel to it. It is very slim, but it somewhat feels like a toy rather than a \"solid\" phone. I like the fact that it is lightweight and I don't mind the plastic feel. Some people might. When you hold this phone compared to something like the Evo or the iPhone, you can defiantly feel the difference in construction and the S2 does feel more flimsy.Final Thoughts:The Galaxy S2 is a great Android phone, there is no doubt about it. It is plagued by a couple issues that may be important to some people and unimportant to others, but overall it is still a very good phone. However, at this point I would just wait for the Galaxy Nexus to come out for Sprint if you like this phone. It is essentially an upgrade to the S2 and has a better resolution despite a smaller screen (which some people might like).", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic phone - The best on the Market!", "Author": "Mackie", "ReviewID": "R1SOOH9H1X8BZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I rarely write reviews, but this phone has been consistently amazing ever since I received it in the mail a few days ago.  At .01, it's a steal! (thanks Amazon).Thin, light, and FAST is the best way to describe it.  It feels like air in your pocket, the textured back is a joy to hold, and as far as internals, no phone has been able to touch it yet.I'm not sure what fairy dust Samsung sprinkled into the Dual Core Exynos 1.2Ghz processor, but it has consistently beat other (higher clock speed, even) phones over the past year, even besting the most recent Galaxy Nexus in Quadrant scores.  The result is you can throw any graphically intensive game at it, and it will chomp it it with glee.  So far, I've installed N.O.V.A 2, Cody, and Riptide GP and all games play at a level that rivals current generation video game consoles. It's really impressive. And it looks great......The screen! There's no equal, period.  Although the resolution is 800x480, the sub pixel accuracy combined with the technology of super amoled plus produce a bright screen with the best contrast ratio on any phone out today.  While certain screens have higher dpi, this is more than offset by how vibrant the screen is.I must comment on Touchwiz 4.0, it is by far the most fluid Android skin that I have ever encountered. Furthermore, the motion gestures are actually useful, allowing you to swich home screens with one hand while moving icons/widgets.  Oh, and the widget menu is actually intuitive! A swipe at the bottom of the screen allows you to quickly pick and place any widget exactly how you like to.  What also helps, is the widgets have a 'predictive' placeholder enabled which allow you to see if it will actually fit on the home page before trying to place it there.  Seven home screens available at first, with complete customization of app tray icons as well as folder creation round out the package. Excellent.Battery life is outstanding. With 4G and Wifi enabled, I was happy to find out I had a good 40% battery left after fifteen hours of light use.  This phone can easilly last two days with minimal use, it sips power.The speakerphone is good, but not the loudest.  You won't be craking tunes off this bad boy, but it does the job fine.Call quality is great on the sprint network, no dropped calls. As an added bonus, there is a 4G toggle switch bulit into the notification bar. But honestly, there's never really a reason to disable it.Notification light! There is one, it's grand.  Thank you, Sprint, for slapping one on.The Camera is fantastic, capable of recording 1080p video.  The only caveat is, I wish you could launch the camera from the lock screen with Touchwiz.  It's such an easy fix, and I know alot of people want to jump right into taking pictures.Overall, this is the best Android smartphone available on Sprint, and in my opinion, the best phone available period.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best option out there for an Android phone on Sprint!", "Author": "dt2008", "ReviewID": "R1ZVRMA6JQUNNI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got my Galaxy S II Epic Touch 4G (longest and completely unnecessary product name...ever) at the Sprint store, but the phone will be the same if you order it from Amazon or Sprint (though you can save $50 through Amazon, because upgrading or purchasing new with 2-yr agreement with Sprint, the phone rings in at $199.99 as of December 4, 2011). A Sprint told me I would have to pay a $35 activation fee for upgrading my phone (this is after he had already swiped my card, he didn't tell me this before, but that's neither here nor there).Positives:1. The phone's screen is HUGE. It's beautiful. The color can be vibrant or soft depending on the settings which you can tweak a variety of ways.2. It's extremely snappy! No lagging in most of the apps that I use (Kindle, Fandango, Movies, Chase Bank, YouTube, Gmail, Facebook, SoundHound).3. You get a cool notice with how much percentage EXACTLY is left on your battery charge, and then when the battery is done charging, you get a notice to unplug the phone. This is good for the battery, and I like the latter notice.4. Samsung was smart and gave the back of the phone a little bit of a grip, and this makes me feel MUCH safer pulling this phone out of my pocket!! It's so thin and lightweight that you really can forget you even have it on you!5. The photos taken with the flash come out looking better than most cheap sensor-having digital cameras. Really no point to have a $80 Point-and-Shoot anymore, just use your cellphone. If you need a better camera, I would get one for sensors and the zooming lens, otherwise this is fine (and I have 2 cameras!).6. Vlingo Voice is a great addition to Voice Commands! It understands 95% of what I say. Once I get a phone holder for my car, I can safely get directions, receive notifications or send quick text messages/calls. Vlingo and Google work seamlessly on this phone to help you search the web or your phone.Negatives:1. The Audio Jack doesn't work with the 3.5mm auxiliary cable from Monster that works with my old HTC Sprint Hero and iPod nano. The phone's Audio Jack is at a slight angle, so there isn't a true connection for the metal. If I hold onto the jack, the stereo in my car can somewhat pick up the sound and it hollowly echoes in my car speakers. This is awful. I need to find a new cord (extra money out of my pocket) or jack adapter just to listen to Amazon MP3 from this phone. The speakers are also not that great for watching movies, so I would suggest using earbuds, but make sure the jack fits! On the plus side, it fits with my cheapo Memorex earbuds (which, granted, have a slightly thinner jack area than the Monster cable).2. The battery seems to be doing okay, considering I have the screen shut off at about 5 seconds of no use in the \"Home\" screen. This is not my preference. In the actual \"phone/wallpaper/apps\" area, if I don't use the phone for 15 seconds, the screen goes black. I have the setting at 30 seconds, but it fades at 5 and then turns off at 15 seconds. I need to tweak this more.3. Android Gingerbread still doesn't have the full features of Gmail. You cannot \"filter messages like this\" anywhere inside of Gmail, you must manually label each e-mail is my understanding. Well, at least the lables are color-coded like they are in the web version of Gmail, right?4. I am not sure if the battery icon is accurate enough in pixels. When I first bought the phone, it had a slight charge good enough for about 2 hours before I got a low battery notice. OK, that makes sense, but I couldn't understand why the green battery icon showed more than 50% full.5. Adding application widgets to a screen isn't intuitive. If you want just the icon, you need to go into the Applications screen and hold it down until it allows you to drag it to a home screen. If you want the application's widget (example: YouTube widget vs icon), you need to go to the Menu -> Add -> Widget feature. Google needs to cleanup that OS feature, because it makes no sense to anyone.6. The OS doesn't automatically capitalize proper pronouns or names, which drives me absolutely crazy. Even my HTC Hero which wasn't on Gingerbread knew the difference between Japan and japan!!!!7. Cheap and shorter than a hooker's mini-skirt USB charging cord. I've already ordered a replacement/back-up cord because the included one is LAUGHABLE.Conclusion:This phone is the best choice for Android on Sprint. The size of the phone is large, but you really are just at the sweet spot before ridiculously too small for reading and too large for pocketing. I wear women's skinny jeans and this phone slipped beautifully into my back pocket! Also, new women's handbags are making wider mouthed mobile slots, so you can easily get this in there. I picked up a white iPhone to compare the screen and weight, and the iPhone 4S was HEAVY and thick compared to this beauty! The Samsung Galaxy S II has elegantly flushed side volume and power buttons, so you really don't have any strange protrusions like with the iPhone 4S in my opinion.  Most of my complaints about this phone stem from the Google Android OS Gingerbread, not the hardware, so take that into consideration.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Evo to SGS2", "Author": "A. Rich \"kittenpajamas\"", "ReviewID": "R5KIT3XD6BGV2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have long been afraid to give up my Evo for any new phone, despite some things driving me crazy about it.  Then the Samsung GS2 was released on the day my Evo finally died (just the battery, not the phone, it literally stopped charging).  I went to Sprint for a battery and discovered this beautiful phone.  Having owned multiple LED/LCD TVs/bluray/monitors/etc from Samsung, I had no question to the quality of the phone.Please note I am speaking of the SPRINT version of this phone only!  This is a partial review, as I have not fully tested everything yet, I will return for more updates.Things I love about SGS2 so far:1. Gorgeous, large (4.5) Amoled screen.  This thing is so bright and easy to see I don't understand why EVO didn't ship with AmoLED. I had the guys at my sprint store installed the screen protector for me, and there has been no issue with pushing buttons, which I had with my evo when it had the screen protector (also done by sprint guys).2. Dual processors! 1.2GHZ dual core processors make it so the phone is super snappy, and I have not had lag once even while running a bunch of apps.3. Video processing: After trying different site's videos (YouTUBE, Hulu, random others) this phone has flawlessly ran any video or stream, no buffering yet!4. Size:  This is a personal opinion, but I like how large and flat the phone is, the case is beautiful shades and textures of grey.  I missed my kickstand, but that was easily fixed with the new case Sprint has, which has a kickstand on it.5. This was confusing at first, but the phone comes with a 16gb sd card INTERNALLY from what I am told.  This has caused much confusion for rooting and other things with a lot of folks.  The actual SD card slot takes a 32gb card, and because I just wanted the best I made sure to get CLASS 10.  Now I don't know if there is a whole lot of difference for the average user, but it is much faster than my 16gb class 2 in my evo.  To me personally it was worth the extra few dollars at Fry's.6. Ships stock with Swype. I used to hate swype. Now that I watched the tutorials on their website to learn to use it correctly, I LOVE it. It is so much faster in most cases to just swype instead of typing things out. It doesn't always work flawlessly, but a lot of the time it is fine.Things that I don't like so far/soso stuff:1. The home keys at the bottom are switched up from my evo which has been confusing should those buttons not be lit up - HTC has it as Home, Settings, Back, Search; Samsung has it as Settings, Home, Back, Search.  Certainly just a personal issue for me having used the EVO for so long my fingers go to the wrong buttons automatically, but I will get used to it.2. For some reason the US version or maybe the sprint version of this phone does not seem to have support for Samsung Apps or the Game Hub they state on the samsung site.  Every other country seems to have these things on their stock devices, but I can't seem to even find a date when we will get these apps on our phones.3. The lockscreen is kind of choppy and hard to open quickly FOR ME.  Obviously this can be changed, but for now I am speaking of the STOCK device.4. The battery life is okay on it, certainly not outstanding, but I have yet to find a stock phone/battery that does.5. Rooting the US version is very difficult.  This is obviously personal, but having followed the xda forums, and having rooted phones before, it is near impossible to go back to stock unless you are really careful and use a good backup rom program. A number of people, especially from sprint, have bricked their phones quickly trying to do this, even with CWM/CM7, and since there is no firmware release for D710 it's very risky to do this right now, unless you are an advanced user/dev.That's about it for now, I will update again later, when I delve more into it.

What has truley amazed me about this product is that over time, it hasnt started to slow down. My phone still feels very fluid. The battery life lasts me a day, but I must say with the most recent update to Ice Cream Sandwich the battery life hasnt been as stellar, it is still good, but it isnt AMAZING. Will it last you a day? Probably.For phone nerds: Rooting is a pain and I just stopped trying. The great news though is that with the update you can use the stock ICS launcher and it looks really good, is it a galaxy nexus, no, but it is a zippy stock feeling that I am more than happy with.For everyone else: The phone feels great in your hand. It is SUPER light and very thin. Colors are vibrant and the camera on the phone still rivals the cameras on todays phones. Call quality is great as well as signal strength. I have dropped 1 call before on this phone, for 6 months of ownershop that isnt that bad.But now it is time to look at this phone in comarison with what is avalible today. Is this as good as a galaxy S3? No. The S3 has a better screen resoloution, more ram, and is more likeley to be supported by samsung further into the future meaning that you will get lots more features in the future. The S3 and the Evo LTE both have a large advantage over this phone though, it has 4g LTE. Sprint's company that has been rolling out the \"4g\" supported by this phone is pretty much stalled on rollout due to the fact that the 4g technology that this phone uses is not the industry standard. If you arent covered by the 4g now, dont hold your breath. Sprint is deploing their LTE network which is much faster, at a very rapid pace.My advice with this phone. If the price point fits your budget, you wont be disapointed, I love mine. However if you can afford, I would recommend going with an LTE phone like the S3 or and Evo 4g Lte. Keep in mind that the phone that you buy will account for only about 5-10% of the cost of owning the phone for 2 years. It might seem like a lot of money to buy the better phone, but over the course of 2 years you will be happy that you did.I gave this phone 5 stars for my experience with it.

It's got a gorgeous screen, ample storage space, great camera, and very responsive.  However there are two glaring issues that I'm having a hard time getting past.Signal strength - coming from an Evo I'm used to pretty good signal.  The Epic Touch 4g has 1 bar or no signal in the exact same places.  It's annoying but not a dealbreaker since I can still get enough signal to make and receive calls most places.GPS - horrible horrible.  You can use the GPS but if you turn it off and back on, you'll have to restart the phone to get a location lock.  Even with apps to clear the GPS cache, I still have to power off and on if I want to use the GPS.  Even then, you better be outside when doing it, and it will still be slow.  With Beautiful Widgets I very often get \"invalid location\" whether I've got it set for wireless network or GPS.  That's not due to an update in the app., it only started happening when I bought the Epic Touch 4g.  For someone who travels often, the GPS is a complete nightmare.If you don't have need for GPS, the phone is a good option if you are in a WiMax area since Sprint will likely make those the last places to get LTE, but if you value your GPS like I do - you will want to choose a different phone.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "loving it", "Author": "shydig843", "ReviewID": "R2YE4QL5KGGRX4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my new phone I said new due to the fact that it looked as if i just bought it......I'm loving it", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product/Service", "Author": "Johnny Bravo", "ReviewID": "RA0OWFDSAGWSN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this product it came earlier than what it should of. and when it came it looked just like the pictures i had seen on amazon works good and everything i had it for about a month now and had no problems with it,u guys get a thumbs up and you wil be seeing and reciveng my services again.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!", "Author": "Armando", "ReviewID": "R1GOO86TIR3YE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely amazing!

My previous phone was a Blackberry Curve 8330. This phone blows that one out of the water by a ton. It's awesome. It's more like a handheld computer then a phone really. It's more powerful and portable then my laptop even.I originally thought the screen might be too big but I was wrong. I love the extra room compared to screens of the other phones on the market.Before my purchase I was also concerned about the touchscreen typing. Coming from the convenient qwerty keyboard of the blackberry, a touchscreen has been a bit of an adjustment but swype makes it easy. The screen size also helps with this as there is more room for the keyboard.Another pre purchase concern was battery life. My wife has had the Evo and Evo 3D and has to charge her phone all the time. It seems like a big hassle. While I don't use the phone constantly like she does, I'm very pleased with the battery life thus far. It usually lasts me the whole day on moderate usage. That's acceptable to me, given the power of the device.All in all the phone does everything I want out to do and more. I highly recommend it.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "\"The Best Phone of 2011\"", "Author": "Crash Override \"Crash\"", "ReviewID": "R3PUOGMFEIUN5D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this phone now for 2 weeks. I've spent the whole time exploring and figuring out the phone's capabilities, and here is my report. Wow. This phone blows me away. My other choice was the iPhone 4S - I am so glad I dodged that bullet. I have a hard time imagining anyone saying anything negative about this phone. The battery life on the phone is nothing shy of spectacular (especially when compared to the 4S). I've gotten 2 full days on 1 charge with light to moderate use including media, internet, and bluetooth. The biggest drain on the battery is weak signal (specifically for 3G data). In the metal building where I work, I have 0-1 bars at best. On the 1st day of of work use, I left the 3G on and lost 30-35% battery after 9 hours without making a single phone call or using and data, I only sent 3-4 texts (don't need as much signal to do so). But here's what I found out later. It's not having the 3G on that kills the battery, it's having the 3G on with no signal that kills the battery. The following weekend, while at home on 3G/Wi-fi, the phone lasted 2 full days before going on the charger Sunday night. The Epic Touch has built in, what other phones require several apps to achieve. Samsung powered by Vlingo for Voice Talk is a nice touch. There's a built in file explorer, which is a big plus for me and those like me who aren't iPeople. Text-to-speech, Voice Recognition, the list goes on. Now let's talk about speed. The Galaxy S2 has been called \"The Best Phone of 2011\" by PCWorld. One of the reasons is the incredible processor. Lot's of phones have a 1.2GHz dual core processor, but they're not the Exynos processor. It's like comparing an Intel with an AMD of the same clock speed. No contest. It's by far the fastest platform on the market. It gets it done, and gets it done now. Now for the screen. You're thinking maybe you don't like the low 800x480 resolution? Think again, it's apples and oranges. You can't compare a 960x540 TFT with a 800x480 Super AMOLED Plus. That \"plus\" is the dealmaker. It's unmatched, even the iPhone's Retina display loses in side by side comparisons -Engadget. (Although, to give credit to Apple, even newer phones with higher resolutions still don't surpass the Retina display's pixel density). But the iPhone's screen is simply too small for my taste. Even the up and coming Galaxy Nexus falls short of this phone's CPU power and display aesthetics. As far as some people's reviews stating that the phone had som weird signal issue, I've not experienced anything like this. I have just as good, if not better signal than my last phone. All in all, this phone is the unrivaled people's champion. Don't forget, this phone will be getting an Ice Cream Sanwich update very soon.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Android Phone", "Author": "johnnyb588", "ReviewID": "R1511GTSB2DLQZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Long story short, this is the best Android phone there is.  You can make arguments that it has rivals, but there is no phone better.  This phone is half a year old, and there still hasn't been an Android phone released that clearly tops it.  It's that good.  Even the phones scheduled for release this holiday season are only expected to be \"on par\" with it, and not truly surpass it by great measures.  If you have any doubts about this phone, get rid of them.  This is as good as it gets at the moment.Feel- Extremely light with a comfortable form factor.  4.52 inches of screen real estate is a little difficult to get used to, but I don't think it's so big that it's uncomfortable.  I have small hands, and I can still manage to type with one hand.  Some people complain abou the plastic feeling cheap, but I honestly have no idea where that comes from.  Since when does a phone have to feel either metal or heavy to feel expensive and sturdy?Battery- More powerful than any other Android phone out there, but its battery is still better as well.  It's a win-win.  I have no problem going a full 15 hours without charging.Screen- SAMOLED+ is that good.  The low resolution is an ever so slight disappointment, but let's be honest, unless you're looking at the screen from less than a foot away, you're not going to notice any pixelation.  I would take this screen over any other phone's screen today.  Brighter, better colors, more \"crisp.\"Speed- This phone is blazing fast.  Less lag than any other phone I have used, including Droid X2, Evo 3D, Sensation, and iPhone 4 (haven't used the Bionic).  You get nearly instantaneous response for every command, and I absolutely love it.Call quality- I switched carriers to get this phone, so I can't say for sure it's better than other phones on the same carrier, but I haven't had one dropped call yet (I'm in a major metro area).  The speaker phone could be a little louder, but I have used it for a conference call in a room with 15 others, and it served its purpose well enough.Features- It has virtually anything you could ask for.  I think it is worth nothing that the camera on this phone is superb.  If you have a point-and-shoot that's around $150 or less, you can pretty much toss it.  The video quality is also fantastic.  1080p recording is a little choppy, so I would recommend recording video in 720p or lower, but having the ability to record 1080p if I wanted is pretty awesome.  I can't possibly cover all the other features, but I thought the camera definitely deserved the praise.  I'll just say that, if you want it, this phone has it.If you want a phone now, there's no question that you should get some version of the SGS2.  If you are on Verizon and really want to stay there, you could wait for the Nexus Prime/Galaxy Nexus.  It will be virtually the same phone with LTE and the \"Google Experience.\"  To be honest, I like TouchWiz and I like Sprint's unlimited data.  I couldn't be happier with my SGS2, and I don't think anyone would truly be disappointed if they had one.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best phone 2011?", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "R28OUDBATIBPIV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome screen.

First time with Sprint - after 1 month very happy.Screen size: great and not so great.  Screen size is important to me because I browse on the web a lot and read on it quite a bit.  A phone is not my first choice for reading, but the size is very good here.  The screen has great color and is very responsive.  The funny part about the size?  Makes one handed dialing on the phone tricky.  I have average hands and using one hand to dial and then call can get tricky.  I've dropped my share of phones, so I hold my phones very carefully but because of the size of the SII, it can still get out of my hands (dropped it twice in the first week alone).  I have adjusted and can manage well with one hand now.  Final word on the size - it's not just how big the screen is - it's also how thin the device is - that's what makes it hard to hold.  Conclusion: the screen is a huge winner for me despite early misgivings.Speed: 1 or 2 of my apps do not load quickly, so I'm not gonna brag about the speed.  For a phone that's supposed to be fast, ANY app that takes a while makes me question just how fast it it.Battery: best I've ever had in a smartphone.  Period.  Just yesterday I ran into my first low battery on it.  Why?  Because it had been unplugged for a day and a half - and I generally use the phone pretty moderately.  Of course, if you turn on 4g it can eat up battery life pretty quick, but you can easily turn it off.  4g is great when it works.Touchwiz: not a fan.  HTC's sense is better and while Touchwiz does have a few cool things to it once I got used to it, HTC definitely wins here.  But I've adapted and things are okay.Music: real downer here.  Playing music through the device is not as good as the HTC phones (I've had 3).  Just sounds real tinny.  Very very surprised by that.  However . . .Call sound: very surprised to write this.  This phone has easily the best sound I've ever had in a smartphone from a call sound perspective.  It just seems like it goes a little louder than other handsets.  Certainly one of the factors that led me to give this 5 stars.  I've read where others are not impressed with the call sound, maybe I got lucky, but I'm not kidding when I say it's the best I've ever experienced.  That alone probably made me a huge fan of this phone.  Another point? I use a cord in my car to connect the phone to the car's sound system.  On every smartphone I've ever used, when I answer a call with the phone hooked up to the car's sound system, there is feedback.  Not here.  I am very happy when I answer a call and it goes through my car's speakers.  And callers can here me clearly with no feedback or echo.  Again - first smartphone that's done that well.Build quality: could not disagree more with some people's take.  While it has a plasticy feel to it, it seems very intelligently designed.  My observation has been that powerful phones that seem a little underwhelming when you first get them, as you adjust, you see how intelligently they are designed.  My HTC Incredible was like that - seem too light and fragile.  But once you see how strong they are built, you turn a corner and realize they are very tough - which makes the phone even more impressive.  Again, light and seemingly fragile but very tough.Initially, I really didn't like the overall size and Touchwiz, but once I got used to the phone I realized it passed the only important test: is there any phone out there right now I'd rather have?  No.  If there was a 4\" iPhone I'd switch to that but there isn't.  And I use my screen a lot.

Speedtest.net averaged around 5 mbps down and 6 mbps up.Unfortunately, its a whole different story when using it on the road where Speedtest.net averaged around 600 kbps down and 500 kbps up in Central NJ.There are no existing 4G towers so I am defaulting to 3G which pretty much cripples the phone.To boot, Sprint STOPPED rolling out 4G WiMax towers and will instead be rolling out 4G LTE towers during 2nd half of 2012 and into 2013.Although they are both labeled 4G, these are two distinct technologies and my current Samsung Galaxy SII Epic Touch is ONLY ABLE to operate under 4G WiMax.So what does that mean for me? Since there is no existing 4G WiMax service where I live now, and any new 4G LTE will not be compatible with my  shiny new phone, I would be using it EXCLUSIVELY as a 3G phone for the life of the contract (2 years).It would be nice if Sprint employee informed me of this when I purchased it, don't you think?  Well, I decided to return this phone (within 14 days and eat the $36 activation fee) and will be porting out to Verizon Wireless where they have extensive 4G LTE coverage in my area.So, if you currently can receive 4G WiMax signals where you live, by all means upgrade to this phone.  The phone itself is awesome and you won't regret it.But, if you are like me living in a 3G area only, forget the upgrade and wait until Sprint starts rolling out LTE compatible devices (projected to be 2nd half) but with Sprint/Lightsquared fiasco going on now, I would seriously consider porting out.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone, my review is for sprint Costumer service", "Author": "hydenunez", "ReviewID": "R1ESWZW8M9GO2T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I COPY MY STORY FROM THE SPRINT FORUMThis is my story with SprintI bought a Galaxy S2 in October 2011, beautiful phone, loved it since the very first day, activated it, all went very smoothly, good signal, good connection speed, all good for the first couple of days ( the first 30 days are the most important ones, because during this trial period is where you decide if you want to keep the phone, the company, the plan).But in February 12, 2012 ( just 4 months after purchase... 4 months into my 2 year contract) I started having problems with my service. I noticed that i kept getting voicemails from phone calls I did not hear, just the voicemail, no missed calls, when i tried to reply these calls i wouldnt be able to, calls were not going through, that day i ignored the issue, maybe its just a temporary thing i said to myself. But over the next 2 days the problem persisted and i decided to call Sprint to complain. I was told there was a service outtage and that the issue should resolve within 24-48 hours ( This was 4 months ago! ). Needless to say the issue was not resolved, and 72 hours later i called and i was told that the issue was going to resolve that night \" at 10:34 Central time\", at 10:35 central time the issue was still there, then they said \"tomorrow\", tomorrow came, still same problem.I was told i had to reset my phone (meaning back up my contacts and lose all my apps); which i did, still the issue persistedI was told to take the phone to the nearest sprint repair center, which i did. But here is the issue, the phone worked perfectly when i took it to the repair center, that's when i realized (while the guy at the center was looking at me as if was a mad man claiming to have seen an alien) that my phone did not work exclusively in my appartment, and everywhere else in chicago it worked perfectly. I was told by the very nice guy who helped me (yes, the only person out of the 125.. ish sprint representatives that i spoke to who actually helped me) that i should try to get an Airwave device of something of the sort.I called and inquired about such device and was told that we need to wait to see if the issue resolves before getting it. 2 weeks gone by, nearly 3 and still i was unable to communicate in my apartment or nearby. During one of these calls i am told that the tower that seems to be affecting my cell phone will be down until September, and that in the meantime there is nothing that can be done.I call again and (at this point i begin to lose my patience) ask nicely if i am expected not to make a phone call from my apartment for the next 6 months. Then I get this airwave thing approved.I set it up and it worked the first couple of days, but then it kept getting disconected, turning lights on and off, blinking yellow and green, not knowing when it's working, when it is not, i called sprint several times and each time i was told to reset, a process that required waiting until the next day to see if the whole thing had worked.4 months have gone by and Still i am :- unable to communicate with my fiance and my family when i get home from work- Unable to return my work related calls ( i am a doctor, i am expected to answer within the minute when i am paged... it would take me an average of 10 minutes, some 20-30 call attempts to actually get a phone call out)- Receive calls from delivery services when i ordered something, after  while i just ordered carry out, thanks to my phone.- Receive the so called \"follow up calls\" from Sprint, the next day to see if my issue had been solvedNow, i hope someone would undertand how frustrating it is that everytime i called sprint to complain about this issue, someone completely new and unaware of my problems would answer the phone, i had to explain the issue, they would ask some stupid questions and then transfer me to a higher up person, of course, to whom i would have to explain the whole thing one more time, only to be fed lies about timelines and expectations to have my issue solved.I dont ask for much from a phone company, i ask to be able to make and receive phone calls. Before sprint i was with metro PCS a company that charged me 40 bucks a month for which i was able to make and receive [hone calls without any problem.... and no contract. I decided to \"upgrade\" went to a larger company, with larger national coverage and bout a much nicer phone, that tweets and updates facebook status without any problems... but cant make or receive a damn phone call when i am in my apartment.My greatest dissapointment is not the fact that I Had a problem, MY GREATEST DISSAPOINMENT is the POOR COSTUMER SERVICE THAT I RECEIVED FROM SPRINT. To the point that when i asked about terminating my contract and perhaps having the early termination fee waved, a guy yelled at me, told me that I was using my phone regularly and thus i was getting the service i paid for and then had the nerve to ask me to reply \"yes\" when asked if he had solved my issue in the next day survey ( i only got that survey phone call once, and lucky for that guy, it wasnt for him).Today I spoke with a cancellation agent, determined to cancel my line and switch to another company before i lose my job, my marriage or my mind. The guy told me that i did not qualify to have the erly termination fee because \" there are not enough towers down in my sector\". Well, thats just about great.This did it for me, tomorrow i will pay that early termination fee, move to another company (this time i wont be looking at phone specs, brands, data speed or even monthly payments) , i will move to the company with the highest costumer satisfaction, as the past 4 months have taught me that this is the most important thing when dealing with a phone company.I asked the guy who tried to help me today ( nice guy, nothing personal) for an email to try to write someone my story, my dissapointment and my opinion, he said there was no one i could write to. Thus i decided that i would write everyone about it, i hope this post is not erased, but if it is i plan to post it on amazon ( i bought my phone through them) and everwhere else where people might listen, because if Sprint wont listen i hope the current costumers and potential costumers of sprint will.I Know this is an isolated issue regarding sprint's coverage, i will admit that almost everywhere else in chicago my phone works great, but the lack of help and level of abuse i have had ( or felt) from sprint is the take home point from this post.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung should not be allowed to make phones", "Author": "qwertyu", "ReviewID": "R1OZSTTDWT10OF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had the Galaxy S Epic 4g upgraded to Galaxy S2 Epic touch 4g.

Beware! worst experience with a phone and seller ever", "Author": "Rishel Vohnoutka", "ReviewID": "R3IMD0NKO3CTOE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I received this phone from the seller I first noticed the charging cord fit loosely into the micro charging port and the port had small scratches around it. I figured it was nothing major and to be expected of a used and then refurbished phone. I soon found out this minor damage was an indicator of the serious damage within the phone and that whomever refurbished the phone also destroyed the inner components. After a month of owning the phone (past the return period of the seller), the phone began to show an error while charging that said \"voltage too high, charging paused.\" This was a more serious problem, but it was past the return period of the phone so I hoped it was just an issue with the type of phone and it would still continue to function. At about 3 or 4 months of owning the phone the serious problems began to surface. First the phone began to charge less and less and would die quicker and quicker. Then the screen image started randomly \"jumping up and down\", as very old TV's do. Next it started to randomly call people even when left on the table with nothing touching it. Then it began to type random letters when the screen was not touched and I tried to text. Finally, at about 5 months, the phone stopped charging all together and no longer functions at all. I kept the phone in a case with a screen protector the entire time I owned it and it was very gently used. I dropped it once from a low height off the ground onto a soft carpet. There are no scuff marks, no scratches, and no physical damage to the phone at all that was not already there when I purchased it (the previously mentioned marks near the charging port). The water damage indicator is not colored inside the phone and it has never been in contact with water when in my possession. There is no reason the phone should be in such poor working order that I am responsible for. This item was also listed as being in great condition and great working order, which is entirely false. It seems almost as if the seller purchases cheap phones and refurbishes them poorly then sells them knowing they will not break within the return period, but will do so shortly after purchase.I do understand that mistakes happen however and so I tried to contact the seller to get at least an explanation and maybe an apology or a discount on another phone. Instead the seller completely ignored anything I sent and closed the return/claim I made. So not only was the phone broken, but the seller did not even respond to my issues with their sale. I also looked into reviews of the seller and saw there were other people with serious issues with the items purchased. Some reviews were even positive and then changed later to reflect that the phone/item was no longer working. With that in mind, I cannot help but think I am not the only one who had a terrible transaction with this seller. I would even go as far as to hypothesize that the reason there are not more bad reviews for this seller is that people had no issues with their product initially and by the time it broke it was past the return period and they were to disgruntled to take the time to change their review or did not know how to.I feel as if this seller is a scam and you, the buyer, should avoid purchases from this seller.

To get around this I had to buy a wall charger and spare battery to swap out when battery gets low.  Sprint would not help since I had cancelled protection plan 1 month before problems started.  Also after much research I found out part of the massive battery drain is due to the 3G connection being on all the time when you don't really need it.  I had to search menus to find a way to turn it off. (under Settings, select \"more\" under \"Wireless and network\", select \"Mobile Networks\", then uncheck \"3G Data\") Your battery will have much more life now.

This past spring, however, our third teen, the one who habitually made off with my cell phone most regularly, graduated from HS and is off to college in less than a month.  So I decided that it was time to get a cell phone of my own, one that's hands-off to the kids, et al.This means that for the most part, I've effectively leapfrogged at least a few generations of cell phones and jumped into the world of smart phones with both feet.A learning curve definitely exists, but I'm climbing it nicely, and am completely enjoying this unit.I do have to admit that the phone is actually a bit larger than I would prefer, but at the same time the screen size and quality is amazing.The buttons at the bottom of the phone are largely intuitive, and within a few minutes I'd figured out how to call, text, email, etc.  OK, the guy at the Spring store actually set up my email (because it's linked to my work email) for me, but my wife linked into her gmail account with no problem.There are some things that are NOT intuitive, though, like how to forward text messages, but I figured that out.

Plus having access to the internet and a huge array of apps makes this a VERY useful tool AND entertainment device.The area where I live has only 3G, but I like that the phone has capability for 4G as well.It's not that I don't know how I got along without this phone before - I know how I did - but now that I have it, I am REALLY enjoying it!Let's see...what else.  With heavy usage I have been getting about 4-6 hours per battery charge.All in all this is a fantastic bit of technology, and I'm glad I have it.

This keyboard is the worst in the world... It sucks terribly!!! Very fustrating...I should switch to another KB I know... No more samsungs for me!!!S***!!! LOL!!!This is my updated review of the Samsung Epic (LOL!) 4G Touch smartphone. After having it for 3 months now, I can give a much better review of it and it's flaws.I've had to downgrade this phone to 3 stars and it's lucky it's getting that. I have 3 gripes with this so-called \"Super Phone!\"1) The Google Navigator GPS. This thing is a joke! I have to use it at work because I drive for a living. To behonest I would say it works 75% of the time. That other 25% it has a hard time locking on to a Satellite. This is a known issue with this phone that they have not corrected. Even with ICS 4.04 or whatever number it is. Or it gives me a wrong location for the address I punched in. That is Google's fault. Not too sure who should get the major blame for this Google Navigator, Google or Samsung. I have a friend who has a Motorola Razr and she has the same problem. Just not as reliable as my 5 year-old Garmin GPS. Very fustrating to say the least.2) This doesn't happen very often at all, but last week I was trying to surf the Internet with it and I was trying to scroll down the webpage and it kept going back to the top. Extremely fustrating.3) The virtual pain in the a** keyboard. I've never liked these to begin with. But I thought with this phone having a 4.5\" screen, that it wouldn't be a problem, but it is. You pretty much have to have Mickey Mouse fingers to type accurately with these keyboards.My first smartphone was the HTC Incredible. Nice phone but it would go buggy while surfing the Net as well. In fact it was much worse. It would start typing letters by itself while I was composing emails and texts. Really weird.All I have to say is, is that they certainly have not perfected the smartphone yet. Most people are paying over $100 a month for these phones. Especially if they are with that ripoff carrier that carries the Incredibles. Fortunately I'm under my sister's family plan and I pay about one third the normal cost for unlimited everything.P.S. There is one significant plus. The phone tethers onto my laptop without kicking me off the Internet, unlike my Droid Incredible 3G used to do constantly. Tether.com is the way to go on that one. Just a one time $29.95 fee and your good. I can PC game online with it, watch Netflix movies with it, Youtubes, etc.I hope this review was helpful.UPDATE 07/01/12:I just wanted to add an update to the Sprint Samsung Galaxy SII.I've had it for one month now and I am very happy with it. The operating system with all the screen menues are so fluid and smooth. You can really feel the power behind the 1.2GHZ Dual-Core processor. On top of that it has an independent GPU (Graphics Processor) as well.Some folks have complained about the location of the power button when they are accessing the volume buttons, inadvertently shutting the phone off. I've experienced this only a few times at the beginning. But now that I'm used to the phone, that doesn't happen anymore.Also, at the beginning the Galaxy SII seemed kind of big for my tastes, but like other reviewers have mentioned, it grows on you. It now feels perfect to me. I kind of like it without the phone case on it, but I would hate to drop it and scuff it up. So the case stays on, which is low profile anyway.I've upgraded my four star rating to a five star rating because after one month of owning it, it has proved to be an excellent smartphone from Korea giant Samsung. I like their other products as well. LCD/LED PC monitors and flat panel TV's.The only downfall is Sprint's 4G Wimax coverage which could be better. I've noticed that their 4G coverage is excellent in commercial areas, but lacks considerably in residential areas. The perfect scenario would be the Samsung Galaxy SII with the Verizon network with Sprint's unbeatable Everything Plan. But unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world. :-(06/13/12 Review:I won't go into a lengthly review of all the features that this phone has, because there are plenty of good ones to read.I've had the phone for two weeks and it works flawlessly. Some folks nit-pick about it only having 800X480 resolution, but believe me, I see no difference between it and phones that have 1280X720. With that Super Amoled Plus screen, everything is crystal clear and sharp with the fonts and the videos look like 1080P. Very impressive to look at. I also think I just found my new E-reader.When I was shopping around for a new smartphone, I told myself that I wasn't going to get a big slab one. I was looking at the Blackberry 9930 and even came pretty close to getting the iphone 4. But those phones with their tiny screens and non-adjustable fonts were just too small to deal with. I mean I could read them, buy I said to myself, why? (And oh by the way... Apple is coming out with a larger screen. 3.95\" worth... lol. Wow... that's going to make a real big difference). On top of that, they are both 3G.Was even looking at the HTC Evo 4G. The only problem with that is that there is no Sprint 4G LTE right now. So your stuck with 3G again. Besides, 4.5\" is my limit. It's been posted that it does take a while to get used to the size of this phone... but it is very thin and light. Small profile.WARNING: I know that T-Mobile is a good carrier... but stay away from their version of the Samsung Galaxy S2. It has a stronger processor at 1.5Ghz, but when I was in their store checking out the display model, it kept freezing on me. I also met a co-worker with the T-Mobile version and he said his does the same thing. So far, no problems with my Sprint version doing that. I also heard that smartphones do this because we don't turn off our phones at night. This is actually what the T-Mobile rep told my co-worker.So I went with the $49.99 Amazon Wireless special on my sister's family plan. I only pay $30 a month for unlimited everything. Used to pay $82 a month with my Droid Incredible with only 450 minutes with that rip-off carrier. Sprint's 4G Wimax coverage could be better. They say they are improving it, but with them coming out with their 4G LTE... who knows.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone, camera, and entertainment device!", "Author": "Stephen G.", "ReviewID": "RHQ2WJ9EUT9XA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this phone!  The screen is gorgeous with deep and rich colors and puts any other phone I consider buying to shame.  The screen is the main reason I keep passing up on very good phones that has screens that just do not POP like these AMOLED screens.  I enjoy watching videos and just using my phone in general.  Hell, even looking at my Live Wallpapers makes me happy on this phone.  The camera is very solid, except for low light situations.  I took this on a trip to Tokyo along with my Canon point and shoot and I honestly took hundreds of photos with this while my Canon collected dust.  Not because it was waaay better as a camera on vacation but because the shots were very nice and clear while this was easier to lug around than even a small point and shoot (due to thinness.)  I literally took 0 pictures with my Canon and over a thousand shots on my Epic Touch.  That fact spokes volumes since I didn't even realize that fact until the end of my trip.  It is plenty fast with its dual-core processor and RAM so using any program and game has been pretty snappy.  The only issue I might have is battery life not lasting me until the end of my day (your results may vary) but that is an issue with damn near all of the smartphones released in the past couple of years.  I hope these companies are working on newer battery technology just like they dedicate to new screen and processor tech.  This phone is great and if you use a program from the Google Play Store called Juice Defender (no I dont know anyone there) I think you will thoroughly enjoy this phone.  Its basically like having a Galaxy S3 with a slightly smaller screen.  I loaded Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and it has been an excellent experience.

The Galaxy S2 has turned out to be a very good phone.  I got 2 of them. I have had no problems yet and the phone works just as good today as it did when I got it new. I could never go back to a small screen now from this 4.55\" screen.I use my phone about 2 hours a day playing games and depending on the app will be very hard on the battery. I've found the app designers are programming to help reduce battery drain but they can only due so much. I always have a charger handy for those days where I play more but I dont feel the battery is inadequate. If I surf the net for a couple hours a day, take a few pictures and text 50 texts along the way the phone stays charged all day with about 25-30% left when I'm getting in bed. Pretty descent. Now watching netflix movies will kill it in 1.5 hours so leaving it on charge is necessary. The battery will get super HOT when it's charging while your watching movies. My battery app measures the temperature of the battery and it shows the battery exceeding 110* at times when I'm using it as it's charging. I don't know if this will shorten the batt life or not.The only weird thing that happend with this phone is the orange \"contacts\" icon got pushed out of my bottom permanent row within 2 minutes of messing around with it the day I got it. Now it's on the home page up top with my other downloaded apps. I don't mind but I've never been able to fix it back to factory placement. Now I just have Phone, Messaging and Applications icons on the home page.I got what you call the \"Fishbone\" case for it off ebay for like $12. It keeps the phone thin but does cause it to be quite grippy when you try to put it in your pocket. I thought after a few months it would not be so grippy but it still is. It has saved my phone from 3 waist high drops onto ceramic tile. It's rubber and flexible but has a fishbone shaped hard plastic piece that goes around the case.

First, let me tell you about amazon wireless. Amazon Wireless is by FAR the easiest to use website for buying a phone with a two year contract. They even activate the phone for you, so when you turn it on its already activated! And they give you a free gift(Car charger!!!). Also, amazon wireless has some of the best prices around! And they even offer FREE two day shipping on all phones so they arrive super quick! It dosent get much better than that! So now let me tell you about the Samsung Galaxy S2 epic touch 4g android phone(i will be calling it 'galaxy' in this review because the name is too long), and why it is currently the best sprint phone on the market.Pros:-It is EXTREMELY light!!! It almost feels like your holding a toy!-1.2 GHZ Dual-Core processor and 1GB RAM. For those of you who dont know what that means, it means it is VERY VERY VERY FAST! Currently the FASTEST sprint phone on the market!!!-Good Size. Before i bought it, when i was looking at the pictures and reviews, i was afraid it would be so big that i wouldnt be able to handle it in one hand and it wouldn't even fit in my pocket. This is Definitely NOT the case. The screen is big yes, but i can still easily handle it in one hand and fits in all my pants, and shorts pockets.-Beautiful super AMOLED screen, the brightness changes according to the environment!!! I think that's pretty cool!-Screen is strong and scratch resistant-Touchwiz-8 megapixel camera, and HD 1080p video recording!! Galaxy's camera is even better than my point and shoot camera! I dont even use my camera anymore now that i have this phone!-Very easy to use-SUPER EASY to transfer files from computer to phone. After you connect using usb cable, the only thing you need to do is copy and paste stuff into your phone's folder!Cons:-The cable is pretty short-does not come with headphonesOther stuff:-Take a picture of screen by holding power button and home button at the same time!-You can make your own folders and organize them-Music and calls still are on when the screen is offWhats in the box:-Phone, battery, usb cable, ac power adapter.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hot Damn", "Author": "MindPrints \"MindPrints\"", "ReviewID": "R28M0SEW3BOIW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had the phone for two days, but I must say I am seriously impressed.Beautiful sleek design.

Also, I shut down GPS and 4G when it is not needed, and vary my screen brightness as needed.As for the phone itself, it is light and sleek.

I've tried looking for fixes, but they all involve flashing third party ROMs on it (not too easy to do for the regular joe who isn't on top of technology).Pros:-Very slim.  Pop this thing in your jeans and hardly anyone will know.-Cheap accesories.  As it uses standard cabling, you can buy cheap knock-off accessories and they work fine.-Big, vibrant screen-Feel in the hand (I know this is subjective, but it feels really good in the hand)Cons:-Battery has gotten a bit \"meh\" after 3 months.  I can get through about 8 hours without charging it.  This involves no video watching, only streaming podcasts (~ 1 hour) and push email on.-The worst GPS I have ever seen.  I could be in the middle of the city without a cloud in the sky and it would take me anywhere from 10-20 minutes to get a GPS positioning.

Some people have worried about the thinness and fragile feel of the phone.  Unfortunately one of the first things I did was drop it - on a hardwood floor!  (I was trying to carry too much junk.)  The battery cover came off, and the battery dropped out.  I put the battery back in, and the cover back on (something I have had trouble doing with some of my previous phones), and it went quickly and easily, and the phone worked just fine and seemed none the worse for wear.  The AT&T; site has some occasionally helpful \"tutorials,\" as does You Tube.  Also, there are books on Amazon, two of which I purchased, but have only had time to use as reference works for looking up problems as they occurred.  My husband and I have been using pay-as-you-go phones for several years now because they fit our lifestyle (at home it's a few calls a week, when traveling it can be really heavy).  Also, our favorite restaurants and bars have free wi-fi, as do most airports now.  Anyway, what I'm getting at is that the IPhone is not available on pay-as-you-go through any carrier that *I know of, whereas the Samsung Galaxy phones ARE.  I would have chosen an Android phone anyhow - simply from watching my friends and relatives using the two types of phones.  I did need to buy a couple of styli from Amazon because I kept hitting two keys at once; they do help ME a lot - and also I downloaded the free Thick Buttons app which makes the keys look bigger, and as it learns the words you usually type, it anticipates your next letter and makes that REALLY BIG.

I've been an avid Blackberry user for 3 years (first with AT&T; and then with T-mobile). I didn't imagine that I would ever go to a touchscreen device.  However, I felt increasingly handicapped by my inability to use web-based applications effectively on the Blackberry. The choice came down to iPhone or Android. After doing careful research (including reading Amazon reviews), I became convinced that Android was the way to go (flexibility, increased memory, independence from iTunes, etc.). The various bloggers and Android forums seem to agree that as of 2011-2012, Samsung Galaxy SII (and its myriad variants) is the a top choice for Android users.The Great Stuff:Light and thin, yet super capable! 4G (where available) is blazing-fast.Screen size: I am amazed at the size of this display! The 4.52\" Super AMOLED Plus is incredibly vivid and there is plenty of screen real estate to do what you need to do. I do a lot of remote login, and this device enables me to get things done nearly as quickly as they can be done on my PC.Processor: 1.2GHz dual core. This is a faster processor than most of the PC's I've owned! Apps launch super fast, and operation is smooth.Memory: 16GB on board, and with my added 32GB microSD card, I have plenty of space to add apps and store data (beats the iPhone!!!!!!!!!!!).Camera: At 8MP, this camera is one of the best you'll ever find in a phone. My wife's iPhone is also equipped with an 8MP camera, but the quality of pics is worse than the ones I was getting with my Blackberry's 5MP camera.The So-So Stuff:Battery life: this phone will work for about half a day with heavy media use before needing to be recharged. I played with the settings and was able to optimize the phone so that it lasts almost the whole day before I need to recharge it. Some power-saving tips-- reduce the screen brightness; choose a static dark wallpaper; reduce the key vibration response intensity; turn off GPS, bluetooth, and WiFi when not in use; close apps when not using them.Typing: imprecise and takes some getting used to (especially if you're coming from a physical keyboard phone).

A nice big screen (almost seemed like a mini-tablet at first compared to my previous phone which was a used Droid Incredible), very fast, great battery life, and (drum roll please)... very good call quality. Who would have thought it? A smart phone that actually does a great job at... uh... BEING A PHONE!Regarding the battery life, I honestly can't believe how much of a charge I still have left at the end of the day on this phone compared to past smart phones I've had. Battery life was a big deal for me and I was worried I'd have to find an \"extended life\" battery like I usually do. But not with this one! Now, I'm not saying it lasts a week or anything like that. In fact it would only last a couple days on a single charge. But with any other smart phone I've had I often wouldn't even make it through a full day on one charge. I charge the phone every night so I don't really need it to last any longer than that, but with this phone it seems that no matter how much stuff I do on it all day long (with the exception of using the navigator excessively -- no phone handles that well for an extended period of time), it still has well over half its battery life left late at night when I go to charge it.I replaced my phone's stock home screen with Go Launcher Ex (the best home screen/launcher IMHO) so I don't have much to say about Samsung's home screen, except that both my wife and son still use it and they seem very happy with it. One nice feature of Go Launcher Ex that is relevant to this phone because of its large screen is that you can turn your home screen into a 5x5 grid instead of the default 4x4. I mean you've got that huuuge screen now so you might as well make good use of it, right?The default keyboard on the Epic 4G Touch is the Swype keyboard. I was concerned about that at first having never used Swype, but my concerns were completely unfounded. First of all, you don't even have to \"swipe\" if you don't want. You can type on it just like you would on any of the other keyboards, and I usually do since I type much faster (with two thumbs) than I swipe, although I've found that swiping is faster than typing when only using one hand. You will want to tap on Swype's settings key though (the one in the bottom-left corner of the keyboard), then tap on Word suggestion, and enable \"auto-correction\". Who in the world would not want this to be the default?!! At first I was like \"Oh no, this thing doesn't auto-correct?\" Then finally I found that setting and all was good with the world again. I mean it is a lot easier to type on this phone because of the larger on-screen keyboard, but it's still an on-screen keyboard so not having auto-correction enabled by default seems kind of dumb to me.There is just one thing I would caution people about with this phone. That is, it's so large that it might not be for everyone. My daughter, for example, who is only 12, has kind of small hands. This would not be the best phone for her, so she got an iPhone 4S instead. But for anyone else, I HIGHLY recommend this phone. And at Amazon's price, it's a complete STEAL! I bought it for 99.99 (which was already a bargain at 50% of the price of buying it directly from Sprint), but I see it's only 79.99 right now. Wow!!***EDIT*** I forgot to mention this earlier. The back of the phone is very slick.

It was an ok phone, however technology advanced too quickly for it to shine.I have read review after review on the SGS2 E4GT and I have also watched video comparisons. None of it prepared me for what I got the day that UPS knocked on my door.PROS:-BATTERY LIFE-This was a major concern for me coming from the 4 hour life HERO. This phone gives me 12 hours EASY!!! I do keep my 4G and GPS off all day, however that is it. I pretty much roam all day because I work in the radiology dept of a hospital. In and out of OR keeps the phone roaming. When I remember I put it in airplane mode. But if I dont NO PROBLEM battery to spare. Oh also, I changed my backgrounds to black (wall paper and lockscreen)-SPEED and LAG FACTOR-The phone is VERY VERY responsive with no lag factor at all. To make sure this stays that way, I reboot my phone daily just in case. Sprint has coverage issues now and then but that has nothing to do with the phone. I have heard ppl mention the lag in the lockscreen. Initially I complained too however then I learned how to actually unlock it. It is actually a side to side or corner to corner swype. Not a middle of the screen to side swype. Once you figure that out... no problem.-SPACE/STORAGE-I have downloaded a TON of apps (just counted 55) and I have not even dented the device memory 2GB. This is big for me bcause with the HERO I only could download like 20 apps. On the flip side, it still kinda sucks that the whole 16GB cannot be used for this whole purpose but...eh.Let me address the plastic feel everyone is complaining about.First thing GET OVER YOURSELVES!!!!! This phone has the largest battery in a cell phone to date and is one of the lightest in weight. How can you complain about that??????? The back cover is not metal its plastic SO WHAT. The phone still has a nice weight to it!!! Put a case on it and WHALA!!! GEEZ these ppl!Oh I love the screen BTW. It is not finger print prone, very smooth!-CHARGE TIME-It takes roughly two hours for a fully charged battery with no usage.-SPEAKER-Very loud.-VIDEO QUALITY-Very good...sound quality not so great. acceptable tho.CONS:The major con that I am having right now it the shutter sound on the camera. Apparently it is illegal in S Korea to take a pic w/o someone knowing or something to that nature.... WELL ITS NOT IN USA so update PLEASE!!! lol UPDATE: Still not fixed with the new update:(One thing that does kinda bother me is that in the applications you can scroll thru them like a carousel and you cannot on the home screen... its like they forgot about that one. Seriously not a big deal tho. UPDATE: No longer a con. I downloaded something to fix this.Update: NEW CON. I cannot take a screen print of a video. The pics come out black... I have tried several times. PLEEASE fix. Major downfall.All in all I love my new phone and I am VERY happy with my purchase although it took over two weeks to get here due to high demand... But it was worth it, Amazon has great pricing and great customer service. I would do it all over again.SignedHappy customer", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE", "Author": "Rena Stanfill", "ReviewID": "R1U57KA56O0R0A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i ORDERED A PHONE FOR MY DAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY THAT SHE NEVER GOT.

Did I go into the store knowing I wanted an Epic Touch? No, I went into the store wanting the best phone Sprint had to offer at the time and it just so happened to be the Epic Touch. I am not going to go through the specs sheet with you guys/gals because you can just read that in the product description. This review will be based on my day to day usage.HARDWARE:The first thing you will notice is the massive Gorilla glass covered screen that is gorgeous, Samsung is calling this screen tech Super AMOLED Plus. Coming from an Epic 4g and a Nexus S 4g (which both have Super AMOLED screens), you can tell that the resolution in this screen is much better. The Sprint version opted for the 4.5 inch screen as appose to the GSM versions which sport slightly smaller screens. Even though the screen restate is bigger, Samsung did a good job of not increasing the width of the phone. When compared side to side, the Epic Touch's width is equal to my EVO 4g. With that said, the Epic Touch is noticeably taller. This makes the experience of holding the phone comfortable; however, usage will vary because there will be icons at the top of the screen that are hard to reach during one handed use.The phone is made primarily of plastic, although the built quality is very good, it is plastic non-the-less. The rim around the phone is a black piano finished plastic that gives the phone a very sophisticated look but it does add to the slipperiness factor of the phone. I often experienced the phone slipping out of my hands when I grab the phone on its sides (like picking it up from a table top) but if I grab the phone from the textured battery cover (like pulling it out of a jacket pocket) then I noticed a much better grip. Because the phone is so thin and wide, holding it in your hands feels awkward at times, as if its not really resting in your hands which gives you the feeling that it can slip out of your grip at anytimeDespite some of the draw backs, I must say that Samsung did an exceptional job with the design and built quality of this phone. I have no problems with the hardware buttons being too flushed or too pronounced. The screen is superb with no dead pixels, my only gripe (if you can call it that) is that the colors are tooooo saturated. Light skinned people appear to have bright pink skin, light brown appears like dark brown, and whites tend to have a pinkish hue to it (UPDATE: I exchanged my first Epic Touch for another one because of some screen responsiveness issues and noticed that the colors on this second phone is much better, still very bright and vivid but not over saturated like the first one). To truly appreciate the Super AMOLED Plus screen, you need to watch a Pixar movie on this phone and witness how gorgeous the screen is.SOFTWARE:The Epic Touch is running on Android version 2.3.6 with TouchWiz 4.0 overlay (Only the European versions have been confirmed to get ICS as of this writing). I have read reviews where people are praising the dual-core processor and saying that their is absolutely no lag in this phone at all. However, I must disagree with that claim. Although the phone is blazing fast, there are moments of slight lag when you over load the phone with running apps or a heavy app. I have noticed on many occasions where the transition animations will lag when you go from app to app. I am not complaining about the lag because it is very minor, but I thought its only fair to tell it like it is.Samsung's TouchWiz interface has improved a lot over the years. I remember hating it on the Epic 4g but am loving it on the Epic Touch. I might even go as far as to say HTC's Sense interface has some serious competition here. Samsung did a good job of giving you useful widgets such as the calendar, weather, etc. They also added some small effects that really give the interface a premium feels. For example, when you press and hold the home screen to add widgets, the home screen will shrink while a menu pops up from the bottom. This is a big departure from the ugly \"what do you want to do\" menu that pops up in the middle of the screen on other android devices.Samsung also included a lot of useful apps such as Kies air (which allows you to sync your phone with your PC and interact with it from your pc, you can receive and reply to txt messages all from your pc), AllShare (which allows you to project your phone screen to a TV screen to view movies or photos), Video App (yes, there is actually a video app here to help organize your videos, no more going into the gallery and randomly picking movies with no titles). The video app goes a long way in helping you enjoy the built in 16gb of memory (with a micro SD slot that takes up to 32gb).What do I love most about this phone? The battery life! For a phone with such a large and bright screen, the Epic Touch's battery life is extremely good. I usually work about 12-14 hrs a day and my EVO 4g is usually dead long before I get off of work. This is not the case with the Epic Touch, after a full work day with heavy txt usage and some data usage (4 PUSH email accounts and blogging), I usually go home with approximately 50% battery life still remaining. AMAZING!One software downside I have noticed is that some of the apps in the market was not programmed to run at the Epic Touch's resolution, so they appear a little blurry. I've only noticed this in less than a hand full of games so not much of a drawback. One of the biggest gripes I have with the phone is the cellular reception, its just terrible. This is something I've noticed in all of my Samsung phones (Epic 4g and Nexus S). The signal on my phone usually hovers around 1-2 bars most of the time. Even in places where I usually get full bars on my EVO 4g, the Epic Touch can only manage 1-2 bars. (UPDATE: Sprint released a software update a few days ago to address this very problem but sadly it didn't do much for me. I still have very poor signal strength)UPDATE: I have been using this phone for months now and one extremely annoying bug I have noticed is the inability to send picture messages. Whenever I try to send a picture message the status is stuck on \"sending\" and the picture is never sent. There is also a problem with receiving picture messages if you have the auto download feature turned on, a simple fix for that is to turn that setting off. However, after wasting many hours on the phone with Sprint to resolve the sending problem I was finally able to find a solution by downloading \"GO SMS Pro\". Whenever I want to send a picture message I have to use GO SMS Pro, I know its not the perfect fix but its better than wasting more time with Sprint's incompetent tech support.FINAL VERDICT:When I reviewed the EVO 4g, I gave it 5 stars despite all of it's draw backs because it still managed to do everything I needed it to do. If it wasn't for the bad battery life (which declines over time with every phone), I would probably still use my EVO 4g. As for the Epic Touch, I feel that it improves on every aspect of a super phone that the EVO 4g first set out to achieve. I would give this phone 6 stars if I could but sadly I am restricted to a 5 star rating system...=)The \"super\" of super phones: 5/5 stars!", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love the phone, hate Sprint", "Author": "A.

The phone worked great but Sprint's service sucks. The wireless service is advertised as 4G but never works as fast as Verizon here in San Francisco.Customer service from Sprint is absolutely horrible. I bought an iPhone from the Apple store for the Sprint service and returned it as it is - sealed in the box - a day later. On the day of return, I called Sprint to let them know that I had returned the phone. I was assured by the rep that the return will be processed and appropriate credits shown in the next couple of weeks.After couple of weeks, they start charging me for the returned phone. I call in again and issued credits for wrongly charged service (thereby Sprint acknowledged that phone line was non-existent). Again, assured that issue would be fixed.Happens again the month after - I am charged for the phantom phone - I am calling it iPhantom now :) Call in again and now the rep transfers me to someone in Accounting who reluctantly removes the charges but resists when I ask him to remove a special app charge related to the phantom line. When I ask how can a non-existent phone download an app, the guy tells me he will remove the charge as a favour. Nice! And, he agrees to terminate the phantom line.Next month, they charge me ETF for terminating the phantom line and returning iPhantom. Call in again. Rep says ETF charged because line was terminated two months after activation. When I tell her the whole story, she transfers back and forth a dozen times and I am finally in hands of some higher power in Sprint. The power that be, wants proof of return of the phone. I give her receipt and return receipt numbers. Then she wants to talk to the Apple Store where I bought and returned the phone. After a long wait, we are in conferences with the Apple store. The Apple store employee verifies all the receipts and confirms that the phone has been returned. The power that be at Sprint is satisfied and agrees to reverse the ETF charge and issues me a credit code. I think, finally, all my struggles have paid off.What did I know? A month later, the charges stand as is. I call in again and am told that Corporate refused the credit code. So very nice of them to not call and tell me that. More escalations and I am told I need to go to the Apple store to resolve the issue. I ask why wasn't I told this on the previous 100 calls? No answer. Just an apology. Ok, I go to the Apple Store. The Apple store employee listens to the whole story and told me it will take a week to resolve the issue. And resolve it, they did. The ETF goes away.Disgusted by the whole experience and Sprint's useless 3g/4G service in SF, I quit the service when they made changes to the family plan in January' 2012. I call customer service and they transfer me first to their manager and then Account services. I am told that since I am opting out of the plan changes, I will not be charged ETF. I jump with joy and say I want out.You know how this ends. A month later, they charge me ETF for two phones. And on and on it goes. I feel like the Energizer bunny now.If you go to a Sprint store to have account issues fixed - they walk you to a phone in the store, dial customer service number and hand you the phone. LOL!In comparison, when we walked into the Verizon store for claiming Corporate discount, the rep and his manager helped us with all the account issues.So great phone but stay away from the service.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Crippled by firmware bugs", "Author": "Kevin McMurtrie", "ReviewID": "R34J2R11V49FNB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update after repair #2:  GPS gradually failed after being repaired by Samsung.  I sent it in for repairs a second time and it came back with only a software update.  GPS now only marginally works - very long lock times and even a single tree causes it to lose lock.Overall I've found that Sprint's service never works when I need it.  I keep getting errors about my Sprint username and password while in the Sierra mountain range and I had no data services for the weekend.  Sprint support later told me that this is normal and the fix is to manually update the PRL while on Sprint's network.  In other words: drive for hours into a Sprint network, update the PRL, and drive for hours to get back.  The PRL can not be updated by any other means.  The phone has no data services at Disneyland.  The phone had no data services when I tried to find a restaurant during SF's Fleet Week.  The phone had no data services when I was last in downtown San Jose.  The phone had no data services when I was in an urban residential area last night.  Go to any outdoor event and this phone is the only one in the crowd that's dead.  It shows a strong 3G or 4G signal but it becomes hot, runs the battery dead, and says you're not connected to the Internet.Skip it.-------Update after repair #1:Samsung replaced an unspecified component under warranty and GPS now usually works (sometimes needs a reboot).  Battery life is significantly worse!  I have WiFi on, IMAP email checks every 15 minutes, and weather updates every 3 hours.  Everything else is off and no other user processes are running.  At best it may run for 22 hours without being used or moved.  It still tends to randomly heat up and run the battery dead with no interaction.  This isn't a phone to rely on.The Sprint forums are still buzzing with complaints about GPS, poor reception, short battery life, and audio crashing.-------I loved this phone when I first got it - Fast, light weight, slim, great camera, and a big screen.  You can check off all the boxes on your list of cool hardware to have.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work well enough to be practical.  I've sent it back to Samsung under warranty even though I'll probably get back a phone equally defective.Live voice quality is usually serviceable but there are still cases where I need a landline.  Sprint's voicemail is completely unintelligible; a babbling robot.  I wish I could disable voicemail so people wouldn't waste their time leaving me a message that I can't understand.  Downloading the voicemail to a desktop computer doesn't help.GPS does not work on many phones.  You may have seen demonstrations where the phone instantly gets a GPS lock, or even works inside a building.  Those demonstrations use cell tower assistance.  GPS can be inaccurate by miles in rural areas and completely incapable of maintaining a lock in weak service areas.  If you do use cell tower assistance, you must consent to Google continuously collecting information.The phone randomly gets hot from stuck processes and runs the battery dead.  I'm seeing this problem mostly when I'm in an area with marginal cell service.  Speculation is that this happens when WiFi tries to go to sleep, but I don't always have it on.  Going hiking or driving in remote areas pretty much guarantees a dead battery by evening.  The only workaround is to keep the phone off or reboot it regularly.Multi-channel sound crashes due to a firmware or hardware defect.  Check any game website about compatibility with this phone - you must turn off the sound or the game will crash.The \"LOS\" (Loss Of Signal) issue.  Certain conditions will cause the cell radio to stop working.  The reception bars will be replaced with \u00f8 and the phone will need to be rebooted.  There's no alert for this happening so you're missing calls.SPRINT DOES NOT PROVIDE WARRANTY SERVICE.  You have a 30 day trial period.  After that, all warranty repairs require sending the phone to Samsung.  Samsung's web site is dysfunctional so hopefully you have a landline to call them.  Total turnaround time is estimated at two weeks.In conclusion, you'll get hit by firmware bugs, Sprint will keep resetting your phone until 30 days pass, you'll send your phone to Samsung for two weeks, get back a phone with the same bugs, and repeat until you figure out how to get a refund.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "COMPLETE P.O.S.

I switched to the Galaxy S II with Sprint in Aug 2012 after being an iPhone user for 3 years and rarely having any issues with the iPhone. Since switching to the Galaxy S II, it's been nothing but headaches ever since. List of problems that I've encountered in the 6 months since switching to the Galaxy S II:- Touch screen sensitivity is sketchy at best and unresponsive at worst.- Android OS freezes frequently and needs to be rebooted. Extremely glitchy.- Phone shuts down arbitrarily and has to be powered up.- The quality of pictures and videos taken with the camera on the Galaxy S II is positively atrocious. Polaroids and 8mm film have this thing beat.- After describing the numerous issues that I've had with my phone to Samsung support, they recommended backing everything up and wiping the phone, which I did. When you back everything up via Kies Air, which is what Samsung had suggested using, you are asked what you specifically want to back up, which includes contacts, messages, applications, etc. Well, to my delight, after I had wiped everything off the phone and tried to do a restore, it only partially restored the full backup that I had done. Long story short, I basically had to restore everything manually.- If you still intend to get a Galaxy S II even after all of the atrocities previously mentioned, do yourself a favor and don't get the phone with Sprint.

Battery life with heavy use is relative to how the phone is connected, but you need to remember that this device is more powerful than the first laptops.

I am so glad I got this phone this time around.  It IS really nice having the best phone on the market.PROS1.  Camera.First of all, probably the thing about this phone is the camera.  It's better than my point-and-shoot camera.  It has like 0.2 less megapixels than my handheld camera, but the quality is LOADS better and SO much sharper on the phone.  My mom couldn't stop commenting about the picture quality.  Another plus is that you can turn the camera around to face yourself.  That is handy when you're trying to get a picture of yourself or someone else with you.2.  The alarm.I like the nice little touch that programmers added onto this phone.  There is a \"smart alarm\" option.  It's a calming, relaxing tone that starts about 5 minutes before your actual alarm goes off to gradually wake you up.3.  Customization options.Remember on your old Android how if you wanted to rearrange your home screens you had to move each individual app to each screen?  Now you don't have to do that.  If you decide you want the right screen to the left of the home screen, you can just move that entire page to the left and move the left to the right of the home screen.  No more rearranging millions of apps to change the pages.4.  The app pageThe app page swipes to the sides, instead of scrolling up and down.  It's MUCH faster and everything is more easily accessible because you SEE what's there instead of trying to see it as it scrolls past you!5.  App tracker.There's a task manager that easily shows you how many apps are running and you can exit them with the click of a button. Alot easier than what Android had before.CONS1.  The lock button.It's on the side, but you get used to it.2.  There's no HDMI port.You can get an adapter, but it doesn't come with a port.  Kind of disappointing for a phone of this caliber.3.  Battery life.Need I say more?!  But it's a given.  This phone has so many capabilities but I do find the battery dying.  I put it on airplane mode during work when I'm not using it and that helps.  But still.  It would probably only last about 6 hours MAX if you were on it constantly.  I would always keep a charger with you if you are on the go.4.  Moving the apps.Ok so you can move the screens around.  But on my Blur I could hover over an app while moving another and that app would move out of the way so I could drop the app I was moving.  That is NOT the case on this phone.  Which is rather annoying and the #1 thing I don't like about this phone.  You have to move the app in the way and then move the app you wanted to move initially.So just some sidenotes.....--Phone Size.I didn't think I would like how large this phone is.  I bought the Blur because it was small and would fit in my pocket.  I have small hands and I didn't like the feel of my boyfriends' Droid X.  I got my phone and it's SO much bigger than the Droid X.  But EVERYONE comments on the screen size and how bright it is.  It IS rather nice.  I didn't think I would like how big it was but I got it anyways and I don't regret it.  Couldn't pass up the $50 deal on Amazon for the best phone on the market.  It feels good in my hand.There's just small little details that went into this phone that make a difference.  Like the default view of the calendar is the monthly view, which is what I prefer. And it's easy to switch back and forth with the options at the top.There's permanent buttons on the bottom of the screen: Phone, Contacts, Messaging, and Apps. So handy.I think that's all for now.  I got the white one.  It think it looks SOOO much sharper than the black one.

Video is fast and smooth, music sound quality is great.My only little complaint, is about finding a holster for it.  It is a Galaxy S II, but I guess the chassis, molding or form factor for sprint is just a few MM larger than whatever the S II cases sold in stores are.

I then switched to Cricket, the phone I purchased wasn't bad, but I needed an unlimited data plan that wouldn't slow down to a crawl after using 3g. I then purchased the Samsung Galaxy S II touchphone from Sprint, and I couldn't be any happier. First, of all the service Ihave received from Sprint has been stellar, and the phone is absolutely fantastic. I still have numerous phones from Verizon, after all those years ofnew every two upgrades, as well as my Cricket Huawei. But, this Samsung Galaxy phone I have is wonderful. I do not see myself putting it aside for an upgrade.That may be Sprint's only downside from having it, the customers may not upgrade to any new phones. I can tell you now, that unless they come out with somethingas great as the Samsung Galaxy S II Epic touch, I won't certainly be upgrading.The size is perfect, the screen size is perfect, the graphics are all great.Keep up the good work, Sprint and Samsung.  I applaud you both.  My co-workers, friends and family members areall excited about my phone, once I show them all of the features, the apps, the graphics, the screen size, manyof them are talking about not only upgrading their phone to a Samsung Galaxy S II Epic touch, but also to Sprint,since I've told them of my experiences.I have a lot of electronics from an Ipod classic 160g, an Ipad 64g, a Pandigital tablet, several laptops, a PSP,but I won't go anywhere without my Samsung Galaxy phone.

Even the power cord is designed so that it easily fits in my pants pocketwithout being huge and bulky. I just think whomever came up with the total design of this phone, hit a home runand won the game.

Where do I start?>Size? The screen is huge and it's Samsung so of course it is beautiful.Responsiveness? Excellent. Not sure how else to say it. Responds to taps and swipes effortlessly and quickly.>Weight? It may look huge but this thing is sooooo much lighter than an iPhone. It feels very solid in the hand but it really is surprisingly light. Love it.>Reliability? I've had it for about a month now and I have not experienced any glitches whatsoever. I do use FastReboot a few times a day and clear the cache periodically just as a safeguard but I have yet to have the phone freeze or feel sluggish in any way.>Storage? Comes with 16gb so, like other similar phones you have plenty of storage. Since I upgraded from a very poor low memory phone (I won't even mention the model - I made a very poor choice! haha) this feels like it's gargantuan. I downloaded plenty of apps and haven't made a dent in the storage space.I'm really not sure what else I can say or need to. The phone is elegantly simple looking, beautiful screen. Oh, the phone?

I just want to say that this is the best Android phone out to date.Fast, slim, light, amazing screen, decent battery life, Samsung's GPU-accelerated launcher/shell with GPU accelerated browser. The camera is also of good quality. While 1080P recording is redundant, it's nice to have :) Also, the bezel around the screen, especially sides, is noticeably thinner than most phones - really cool. Even though this has a larger screen than AT&T; version, it isn't actually noticeably bigger, since the AT&T;'s version has larger bezel.The only few complaints I have are as follows:- The LED is slightly too cool for me. When used as flash light, it outputs blue-ish light, kind of like those riced out HID kits you see on in halogen headlight housings XD *facepalm* Ok, maybe not that bad, but I would guess it's around 5200K. My old Motorola Droid OG had pure white color LED, which I really appreciated.- The phone is slippery and hard to get a grip on because of its lightness. Seriously, the phone is so light, it doesn't sit firmly in your hand. Such a quirk is easily remedied with a protective shell.- No camera button. I miss press-hold to launch camera app on my Droid. Now I actually have to keep a shortcut to the camera app on the home screen. Of course, some welcome minimalistic approach - the fewer buttons, the better. But I'm sure those that use the camera often, like myself, wouldn't mind a physical button (especially dual action). Besides, focusing the lens is more comfortable with a button than tap-hold on the screen.- Bloatware. Enough said. All phones have it, this one is no exception. I have 3 phones on the plan, mine is rooted, others are not. While I removed all the carp I didn't want, my mom and gf use the phone in its stock form. They aren't very tech savvy, of course, and could care less about the notification bar spamming with Sprint app news/updates/bs or ads in apps. My guess is, in a similar manner, to most people that won't matter. Those that do have a problem with bloatware are probably well aware of removal techniques.None of those issues would keep me from buying the phone again (if you call $0.01 \"buying\" lol).", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Will be the best Android on Sprint for a while", "Author": "ASmith \"Hodedofome\"", "ReviewID": "R3HGSKFIDPFNZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only other Android that I would consider 'better' is the Galaxy Nexus, which I doubt will be released on Sprint until they roll out LTE, which will be late 2012.

I was super hesitant to get the Epic Touch simply because it was a samsung made device. Everyone knows what a mess the upgrades were for the original galaxy s line. Not to mention touchwiz was ehhhh. Didn't care for it much. I went into the sprint store and asked if they had a model available for demoing. Not going to lie, I thought the screen was HUGE. Maybe even too big. I picked it up and was shocked how light it was. After playing on it for about 10 minutes, and being captivated by the super amoled plus screen, the screen size no longer mattered. Yes, yes it has a pixel density of 800 by 480. Trust me, it doesn't matter one bit. And did I mention how fast this phone is? BLAZING!!!! Every aspect, from opening apps, to web browsing, to switching screens, FAST!!!! One thing that really puts people off, myself included, is the lag on android devices. The Exnyos processing power is outstanding in this phone. Lag hardly ever exists. As for touchwiz, I really like the improvements Samsung has made in 4.0. I've always been a pure vanilla kinda girl, but the new touchwiz is very intuitive and integrated wonderfully. You have the leap feature for both the main screens and app screens. If you're not sure what touchwiz 4.0 is or how it's different from previous versions, I recommend heading over to youtube and checking out a few reviews. It will help you get to know all you're phone is capable of. Also, I would recommend getting a screen protector and case for this phone. I purchased the ZAGG protector and TPU black matte case. I recommend both products they are perfect for the phone. I've dropped it twice, once when I was getting out of the car and the other I was inside. No dents, scratches, anything. I'm still waiting on otterbox to release a case. The more protection, the better.There are a few quirks here and there, as with everything. The charging cord is kinda short and when the phone is charging, the touch sensitive screen isn't very accurate at times. I've only noticed that when it's charging. The power button is on the side so sometimes I'll accidentally hit that while adjusting the volume. After about 2 months with the phone I've gotten better at not doing that though. This phone also has a notification light. +1 for Samsung finally putting that in their product. The only thing is, it flashes every 8 seconds or so. Within that time I could have just pushed the power button to check if I have a notification..... so that is slightly irritating but I'm still very glad the feature is available.Overall, this is a great phone. If it wasn't for Sprints spotty service, this phone would literally be a 10/10. I've only dropped two calls and they were both at the same place. A friend of mine must live in the black hole of all places because I get zero service there. Other than that, call quality is fantastic everywhere else. Web browsing is a great experience due to the screen size. I can't fit my phone in my pocket due to the size but I've gotten over that real quick. Speaker is very loud. I play a lot of music and have gotten quite a few compliments on the sounds quality and volume level. Touch sensitive buttons are very responsive. I haven't had any issues with hitting one of the buttons and having it not respond the way it should. The phone is THIN!! Which is sooo nice. Camera quality is also fantastic. Great camera shots inside and outside. One LED light is all this phone needs, it's plenty bright. Battery life is also good. I'd still say take a car charger with you though for long days away from home. I'd recommend this phone to anyone and everyone. It's the best phone out for sprint right now, hands down.

It has all the great features from the Galaxy S line (except for Sprint's Epic 4G if you liked the QWERTY keyboard - my mom just got the Epic 4G and loves it). The crappy GPS in the GS1's has been resolved in the GS2: I get a lock almost instantly anywhere outside. There isn't too much preinstalled crapware on the Epic Touch and some of it can be deleted without rooting. The screen is gorgeous despite being relatively low-resolution compared to other new phones and the wifi and 3g/4g connections are really fast (I live right outside Minneapolis). The dual core processor and 1gb of RAM make it super responsive without any hold ups or hiccups. I'm worried that Samsung will be slow to update the OS from Gingerbread to Ice Cream Sandwich and may never update beyond ICS because they were really bad about updating the Galaxy S1's. But right now this phone is probably the most advanced option and works flawlessly.If you have small hands the phone might be uncomfortably wide, although it's incredibly thin and weighs almost nothing.I got the TPU case for about $10 that fits snuggly and I'm happy with that too.Update: I've played around with the camera a little and that's fantastic too. My GS1 (T-Mobile Vibrant) had a nice lens but no flash; the Epic Touch has a surprisingly powerful flash and handles really nicely inside at night.

I really liked that phone after coming from a regular phone with limited internet and other capabilities. The last 6 months or so my Blackberry really started to lag.

The screen is gorgeous and there are a lot of nice little touches with the software.  However, the GPS doesn't work unless I reboot the phone (try doing THAT safely while driving in an unfamiliar area!)and the 3G is spotty, to put it kindly.  I'd love to blame Sprint for the 3G issues, but that'd be unfair. The Galaxy S2 struggles and mosies about where my HTC Evo didn't have any problems.  I ditched the Evo for the Galazy because I thought I was getting a monumental upgrade.  Truth is that it's a step backward. Yes, it can be said that the Evo is obsolete because of its technical specs, but I disagree.  If it works, it's not obsolete.  It's the Galazy that's obsolete.There are also some puzzling issues.  The camera shutter can't be muted or even turned down. It wouldn't be a big deal except that it's very loud. Also, you can assign a custom ringtone, but not a custom notification sound. I found that you CAN work around that by creating a special folder in \"My Files\" and moving your custom sounds to it, but why should you even have to? Even unlocking the phone out of sleep mode is a challenge.  When you wake up the phone, it blinks off after about two seconds and then you have to turn it on again and hope you're fast enough to unlock it. If you're a slowpoke the process repeats until you successfully unlock the phone.Even more curious, to answer a call you have to slide an icon across the screen. I have big hands, but I found it nearly impossible to hold the phone and answer the call with the same hand.  So Samsung forces the user to use two hands (or one hand and one nose) to answer a call. If you don't have two hands free you may wind up having to do unnatural contortions to answer the phone or just accept that you'll miss the call. What about just tapping a button to answer the call like every other smartphone I've had before?Considering the problems right from the start, I don't see myself being tied down to this phone for 18 months when I'm eligible for an upgrade.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "This phone WAS great...", "Author": "Dollyheart", "ReviewID": "R1YT92G5CVBV4Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone WAS great, the best I've ever owned- UNTIL IT WASN'T, because it became 100% useless by the well-documented, well-known \"LoS Bug\" aka Loss of Service bug- what happens is, out of nowhere, you will suddenly get a red circle with a strike through it, and if you are LUCKY, you can restart your phone each time and it will correct itself til the next time- however, mine was not fixable even by restarting.

And part of my decision to get this phone was because it was so pretty and sleek.  And if that doesn't clue you in to how proficient I am with cell phones, this will;  I am not very up to date on cell phones, so this review will be from a slightly below average user of a cell phone (and there are surprisingly many of us with the same affliction).  I sadly lost my 5 Year old Cherry Chocolate when the charging slot broke. It was a very tragic day for me. I'll come clean and say that I've never really seen the need for a data phone. All I do is talk generally on a cell phone, and very rarely text (as I can't stand texting, it seems so inefficient to me) and since I never had data I didn't know what I was missing. But hey, when I switched providers I was offered an unlimited plan to go along with this modern data phone so I could text, talk, and surf all I wanted. So I figured it was time to break down and enter the world of technology that all you young whippersnappers are in. I'm still not sure how I like it, but I learn a little more every day. For reference through this review, my current provider is T-Mobile with the 4G service.Operation:The Galaxy S II is a touch screen phone. Its main screen is used to swipe, tap, etc. all the features that are available. This screen can be viewed horizontally and vertically by how you hold your phone. There are also four buttons at the bottom for contacts, home, back, and search that are used by tapping the associated pictures. There are a couple regular buttons on the side of the phone, and these are used for volume control, and power. The two ports on the phone are one for your charger/computer hookup area (yes I realize I am a technical vocabulary master) and an area for a headphone type plug. A quick note on the charger, it is also the cord to hook the phone to a computer as well, it just involves unplugging from the \"head\" and using the extension. So it serves two purposes which is great!The actual length of the phone holding a charge is more disappointing though. I take the phone off the charger in the morning before I leave for work, and by the time I leave work its almost dead. And I don't use the phone while at work. All the battery sucking applications are turned off and I don't have a bright screen, so I'm not sure what phantom is taking all my power, but something is making it not hold a charge very well. But I suspect that's the way of these phones.There are four main screens that can be reached by swiping across the screen. The home page has applications like the camera, and any other applications you may place there. Another screen is blank and used for whatever you want. Another holds weather and news, and the last monitors your open applications and usages. Getting to any of theses screens is easy to do. Pressing your finger down on any of these screens for an extended period of time allows you to push back the screen to an \"edit\" area where you can alter the icons or access widgets, folders, shortcuts, and wallpapers.The bar area at the top of the screen monitors what your phone is doing. Here you can find the time, any open applications like the alarm that are currently running, battery power, service level and notifications. To access the notifications you use your finger to drag the bar down and then have access to some shortcut buttons that allow you to quickly turn on/off the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, SilentMode, and AutoRotation features. You can also install updates from this screen, access visual and regular voicemail quickly, and see your downloads.The speakers are decent on this phone. While headphones would probably be better, it can get pretty loud with a regular ring tone (if you don't use the vibrate feature). Playing music on it is very doable though and you can hear the words clearly and the music doesn't sound distorted. It does tend to be a little softer as far as volume goes when talking to people or playing music as opposed to the ringtones, someone hard of hearing might have some trouble with the volume.I'm sure there's a lot more to do with the operations of this phone that I haven't even discovered yet, but as a partial luddite, I'm unlikely to discover them very quickly if ever. So this review is more coming from a casual technology user, and hey, there's plenty of us out there. So don't feel bad if you don't know all the bells and whistles on your phone.Talk:This phone is kind of average for talking for me. My biggest complaint is that this phone is incredibly hard to hold between the shoulder and head because of its slim sleek design. Normally this thinness would be a plus, but as I lack a bluetooth it makes it incredibly tough to do anything else while talking on the phone. Not to mention I haven't been able to master holding the phone in one hand while manipulating it with the same hand, I have to use both hands. Which may seem like a petty complaint but efficiency is everything for me. And since I use the phone for talking mostly, it has to be one that I feel comfortable using. I'm adjusting, but its slow going.The volume always seems to be good while talking. I have no problems hearing anybody I talk to, and I'm told that they don't have any problems hearing me. So the audio seems to have good input and output despite the speaker areas being miniscule.The software that goes along with making calls is interesting. There is no quick dial on this phone. Or at least no the quick dial I was used to with the older models. This phone requires you swiping to get in, and from there a couple of button pushes to make a call to the person you want. And this is even with me having a shortcut to the contact on the main face of the phone. Compared to the quick call on older phones where you pressed a button and then send its a complicated system. Not a good phone for dialing while driving, not that you should talk and drive at the same time without a bluetooth. And that is my safety warning for the day.One neat feature about the calling is that phone numbers located in texts and web pages can automatically be called by holding your finger down over the number. It will give you the option to call from there. So incredibly handy when you don't have a pen to write down the number with when searching.Text:Surprisingly, since I'm not a big fan of texting, I actually don't mind texting with this phone. The small touch pad keyboard takes some getting used to with big clunky fingers, but once you do it is much more efficient than pressing the same button four times just to get the letter \"s\". I'd say I text much more than I used to because of this feature.Another great feature is the fact that the text retains the history of texts. So you can tell what you've said before without flipping through numerous screens. Its just a matter of scrolling up or down with your finger. I also enjoy that you can insert pictures and videos directly into this text \"chat\" itself as well.There are several shortcuts to the texting, such as the Swype feature when turned on that lets you just drag your finger from button to button, and the quick words that appear at the top of the keyboard where the phone tries to guess which word you may be spelling and offers you a quick button to use instead.Data:This is the feature of the phone that I didn't expect to really use. And I was partially right in that assumption. Perhaps its just my provider, but I usually only get a good connection to the internet when I'm driving in my car (which means I am NOT surfing the internet) or standing out in the middle of my street, which is also not very safe. I don't get any signal inside my home. The techs said this was ok though because I could just use my wireless connection for my internet there. Sadly, this proves to not be the greatest either, even when I'm sitting five feet away from the wireless router. So I guess I'm just not meant to enjoy my internet.When I do get access it is very slow to bring up pages and sometimes will spin forever until I give up. Most pages that I do access have to be expanded on in order to read anything as well, so scrolling is sometimes interesting as well. But it is handy in a pinch when I need to look something up or check the price for certain items that I'm considering buying. I'll even check my email once in awhile. Supposedly I should have fun streaming music and video on this phone too, but I haven't even attempted it since regular pages have issues.Camera:I love the camera on this phone. Its quite possibly my favorite part of the phone. Great picture, extremely good clarity, and it takes pictures out of both sides so you can use it for a self portrait (which honestly the clarity is so good that I don't do that because it makes me look terrible, every flaw revealed). Zooming is done by the same method you use to expand or shrink other screens. And it holds quite a few pictures because of the storage space. The video is exceptional as well but it does take quite a bit more room on the storage.I've actually taken to just taking my phone when going on trips as opposed to my Nikon because its smaller and the pictures are almost as good. And that really says a lot since I like my Nikon. And like a regular camera, this phone can take pictures in different formats from black and white to sepia, the resolutions can be adjusted, delays can be set, and many other standard camera features can be achieved with it.Applications:I've only downloaded a few applications, but I do enjoy the Angry Birds and the few Restaurant locators I've managed to nab for free. And there are so many different applications that I'm sure there's something out there for everyone. And unlike the internet, the applications usually run at a decent speed.GPS:Since the signal works ok with driving I've had some success with the GPS feature on the phone. It hasn't gotten me lost anyway and the voice is clear and easy to understand. The features that allow you to search for your locations are easy to use and you can have it pick a destination for you by searching for different restaurants, or you can type the address in manually. Another neat feature is that the GPS can be used automatically when browsing the internet. If you find an address on the page, simply hold your finger down on it and it will offer the GPS option to that address.Alarm:Ok, this is probably a weird thing to comment on. But I really like the alarm that is featured on this phone. I haven't used a regular alarm in years, and this one pulls out all the stops. You can adjust volume, what days, frequency, music, and just about anything you can think of on it. And you can set multiple alarms at the same time. Its very convenient and I use it everyday.Overall this isn't a bad phone at all. I wish the battery stayed charged longer, but it has some interesting features. I also would love for the calling options to be easier but since texing is easier maybe I'll start using that feature more. I think that a more tech savvy person might enjoy it more than I have. For an average user this phone may offer a little too much to wrap your head around. I certainly don't use it to its full extent but I haven't felt the need to either. I can't say that if I could go back and buy a different phone then I wouldn't, but now that I have this one I'll probably keep it for a few years as I'm in no hurry to replace it with anything else. It's definitely been a very informative phone for entering the world of data in.Review by M. Reynard 2012", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Frustrating, UNRELIABLE phone", "Author": "arrapa", "ReviewID": "R3U27MVX17DYES", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a little over 3 weeks, but I've barely tapped into what this phone can do... The reason- this phone is constantly freezing when I try to use it, and will stay that way unless I manually reboot the phone.  Sometimes it just reboots on its own (usually in the middle of the night- waking me up).  I would say 5+ reboots per day is not an abnormal amount. I've not loaded the phone with a lot of apps or any media, b/c when I try to use the phone for more than 30 seconds, it freezes.  I'll simply try to swipe from one menu screen to the next, and it freezes; or I'll try and open and use an app like facebook or groupon (nothing data intensive), and the phone freezes.  Yesterday afternoon I charged the phone completely, then made one short call and read a few emails in the evening.  I made sure before I went to sleep the phone wasn't stuck in the middle of anything or frozen, yet this morning the battery was completely drained and the phone was dead. What makes this situation worse for me is the fact that my cell phone is my only phone (I live alone, no landline)- I need a reliable phone.Because I've owned this phone for 3 weeks, I can't just take it back and exchange it for a new one (limit is 2 weeks).  The phone is still under warranty, so I called Samsung tech support, and all they could tell me to do is reset the phone to original factory data settings (which wipes the phone).  If that doesn't work, then I have to send the phone in for repairs.  Guess what? It didn't work.  So now I'm in a situation where I've paid a premium for a lemon of a phone that doesn't work.**Update 7/25/2012**So the problems with my phone persisted- we're talking the phone freezing and requiring restarts somewhere between 5-10 times a day, everyday, since I activated it a few months ago. And it freezes at the most inoppurtune times -  When I'm trying use an app, or check something; or it has frozen and I didn't notice it (if it was in the purse, or the middle of the night)- resulting in battery drain in <30 minutes, leaving me with a dead phone an often no time/outlet to charge it.Anyways, I finally got fed up with it, and called Samsung Tech support again, and they told me to send it in for repairs, which I did.  I just got my phone back and reactivated it last night, and the issue is still there.  It's frozen at least 7 times in the last 12 hours.  The issue that Samsung found and fixed was related to a bad component that affected the phone charging (the phone took forever to charge).  So either this freezing issue can't be fixed, and is due to samsung's sub-par interface/phone design, or Samsung's repair technicians don't know what they're doing.  Now I'm torn with continuing to deal with this glitchy, unreliable phone, or sending it back to Samsung repair so they make another attempt.I've come to this conclusion - I WILL NEVER BUY ANY SAMSUNG MOBILE DEVICE AGAIN.

I previously had the 4G EVO, which I came to hate. The first EVO, landscape orientation died within two weeks, but I had no problems with getting it replaced with a new (not refurbished) model. The second one started acting whiggy within a few months (and I'm not hard on phones; never dropped it--but had a rubberized case for it, just to be safe--never spilled anything on it, etc.). Sit the phone down and it would automatically jump to a random app or screen. Or I'd be in the middle of, say, facebook and it would suddenly switch to a different app or screen. Maybe I just got unlucky, got back-to-back off-the-assembly-line bad EVOs, but I wasn't taking a chance with my 12-mos free phone upgrade, so I went with the Epic Touch 4G, and I feel nothing but love for this phone. Is it wrong to be so attached to inanimate objects? :)PROS: screen clarity is unbelievable; regular and front-facing camera take excellent-for-a-phone-camera photos; can easily switch between at least two open apps using Task Manager; is fairly lightweight (until you get that protective cover on it); haven't yet had a call dropped (unlike with the EVO for some reason); most of the pre-installed apps are ones you'd use anyway (I really hated all the pre-installed sports apps on the EVO); it uses the same car charger/wall charger unit as the EVO, so there's no shelling extra money for accessories to fit this particular phone, which is a huge boon. Switches from portrait to landscape mode easily (maybe too easily); speakerphone has good clarity (though paired with my Plantonics Bluetooth earpiece, I find myself using speakermode less and less often). And what could be both a PRO *and* a CON, this phone does so much, it's almost overwhelming. For the first time ever with a smartphone, I'm actually relying on the manual to uncover all its features/secrets. And probably one of the biggest PROs--unlike most of the mobile carriers, still *unlimited* data/streaming/web usage. Of course that party might end sooner than later, but I'm hoping much much later. (It's the sole reason I did not switch back to the iPhone 4S--I was not going to pay for piecemeal usage.)CONS: for women, though a thin phone it's still fairly long and doesn't fit easily into the standard cellphone pockets found in most handbags today (handbag makers need to start taking this into consideration when they design their purses); this phone *eats* up the battery (even, thanks to the built-in task manager, tweaking apps so that you can turn off, for the most part, a lot of apps that you don't need running in the background all the time)--I've yet to get more than 4 hours out of it before I get the 30% battery left warning message. Then again, as these smartphones are becoming more and more like palm-held computers, that's unsurprising. Unlike with the EVO, however, I'm not going to spend another $80 or so for a bigger battery because it just makes the phone twice as heavy. I just make sure to keep the phone hooked up to my car charger whenever I'm in my car. The specs tout a bigger virtual keyboard, but imo the keys are pretty much the same size as on the EVO. A slide-out actual keyboard is sorely missed (and would have been worth spending extra for). Android phones still cannot touch any iPhone when it comes to apps, imo. I've downloaded and then deleted as many apps as I've kept because they are buggy or just don't work as advertised, or are poorly designed. Would be nice to see the Android market have apps you can 'trust' the way you can most iPhone/Apple apps. And it seems unnecessary how much personal info access many of the Android ads say they \"need\"--I consider it just plain nosy and bypassed many an app that I really liked just because it wanted all that unnecessary personal info. Voice quality of phone calls is a little inferior, a little tinny, which is a disappointment, but nothing that's a deal-breaker. My biggest peeve is not being allowed to create and use my own ringtones and ringbacks. It's absurd to have to pay for a ringtone/ringback of a song clip for a song you likely already have on your iPod or whatever mp3 player you have (or have on your computer), so that is really irksome--esp. when often the available clip isn't even the part of the song you want to use. For those reasons so far I haven't purchased, and likely won't, any ringtones/ringbacks, which is a shame (and something I miss from when I had an iPhone). Also, when it comes to accessorizing, do *not* get your accessories from a Sprint store or the Sprint website. Probably a duh factor, but you can find the same items a good 30% or more cheaper practically anywhere else. And the only other major con for me is having to pay for 4G access every month when 4G isn't even AVAILABLE in my area. (Makes me wonder how Sprint gets away with charging for a service they aren't actually offering providing, although I guess they skirt any consumer laws that might protect against this by virtue of the fact that since it's a *mobile* phone, you likely go in and out of 4G-service areas if you're out and about. But if you're mostly homebound (as I am), paying for a service I can't get is a bit of an ouch factor.)All in all, this phone is worth the freight, and then some. A really superb smartphone/pseudo palm-held computer that won't leave you with a case of buyer's remorse. Now if only I could find the dream docking station/charging cradle where I could plug in all my toys--my smartphone, iPad 2, Kindle, and iPod--when they aren't in use so they are always fully charged....", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great features, but the screen won't stay on.", "Author": "Austin reader", "ReviewID": "R2D6ADBVJM3ZBZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this phone last September.  Right out of the box it had a screen illumination problem:  Fifteen seconds after the screen lights, be it from an incoming call or a user pushing the right side button, it goes black.  No amount of settings adjustments will correct the problem.  You need to keep pushing the side button, after each screen black-out. I have put up with this problem because I never used the phone, much.  Now that my use has picked up, I am not happy.  I contacted Wirefly about the problem and I will see what they have to offer.  I'm relatively certain they'll pass me on to Sprint who will pass me on to Samsung.  I'll update, here, when I know more.  Please save the comments about how I should have taken care of this thing when I first got it.  You're right, OK, but as noted, above, I wasn't using the phone very much, and was far too busy to deal with it, at the time. UPDATE: 4/2012  The 4G network, in Austin, is either terrible or this phone is incapable of locking it in.  Each and every time it starts up, as indicated on the phone, it will show \"zzzzz\" within a minute, or so.  Then you have to stop and restart to get it going, again.  It then promptly goes back to sleep.  The screen black-out is something I am now used to.  I don't have the inclination to hassle with the companies about it.  The voice recognition feature of this phone is pretty cool.  I like speaking my destination, on GPS, and seeing the phone recognize what I'm saying about 80% of the time. UPDATE: 5/10/12:  Battery life is a joke!  I take the fully recharged phone off the charger at 7 AM.

Meaning that the contacts that have more than one phone numbers, email addresses, regular addresses etc are all separate. Even though it looks like I can join each one manually it should have loaded them they way they are in Gmail.2 the touch screen seems a bit wonky, I choose the pattern as security but no matter where my finger was tracing the phone when the opposite way. I disabled security for that reason. I have the same issue with the keyboard, as well as on occasion especially when the phone is charging when I try to type it acts like crazy and letters from the opposite side of the keyboard are chosen.3 the little vibration when you touch the screen is a bit delayed. Not as nice or as smooth as the EVO 4G.4. One more Keyboard complaint.  I got very use to the HTC Keyboard with had little arrows at the bottom to move the cursor around, they must be exclusive to HTC.5. The last thing I didn't know but is that each Android phone apparently is not universal so if you have an app that you absolutly can not live with out like say HULU then check before you buy because some of my fav apps have to be remade or programmed different for the Samsung.6. no dual antennae.  Seriously not cool, in a cutting edge phone.Pro's1. Very light. Amazing how light it is. Slim very comfortable to hold.2. Call quality is great on my end, and I haven't had any complaints from the callers either.3. Fast boot up.4. Signal strength is good.5. Programs start up quickly, no force closes, or freezes yet.6. Speaker is very loud, I am very surprised by this since the opening seems so small.7. The camera is great. Starts up quickly, takes fabulous pictures with very little delay. The HTC EVO had a 3 second delay before it would take a picture sometimes more, I am happy to report the delay is a second or less.Over all I like this phone a lot.

For example; Enter 1234# but the phone sends 12344# with or without the speaker on. The only way to prevent this is to mute the phone when you enter the numbers. I have been to the Spring store and they do not know what to do about this; they have tried hard resets twice with no luck.  - The phone periodically freezes when using an application.  You don't have to power down or remove the battery, just let the screen sleep.  - The battery drain is absolutely terrible.  Fully charged, I can only manage just under two hours on the battery.  That's with the GPS, wireless, and auto-sync disabled AND the phone is sitting idle with the screen not on.  Again, the Sprint store is not sure how to handle this.  - The broadband reception (antennas) capability (3G and wireless - not in a 4G area) is terrible.  I can sit my phone next to an HTC or Motorola and they are SIGNIFICANTLY faster when loading web pages.  It's like watching a web page load over a dial-up modem.  Again, Sprint store is unable to rectify.  - The GPS receiver has a difficult time locking on to a signal.  Seeing as I keep everything turned off unless I need it, the GPS does not continually track.  On average, it takes about 2 to 3 minutes for it to lock on.  - After having used the HTC (Incredible) and Motorola (Droid X2) phones, this one has the worst keypad.  If you don't have child's fingers, you will experience difficulties with the keypad.On a positive note, the Samsung does have an exceptional display and the cameras are very good.

It makes web broswing so much more enjoyable it really feels like your getting the full desktop experience. There's a lot of reviews already so I'll just post a few pros and cons that really stuck out to me.Some Pros:Screen (the colors are amazing and 4.5in is great)Light and Thin (when you first open the box you'll think you got a hallow toy)Pictures and Videos look so good (up to 1080p recording)16gb onboard memory (for many users this is more than enough)UI is sooooo smooth (I've only run into a few hiccups and that was when I had 4G on, multiple applications open, and a bunch of widgets on, and even then it only happened for a moment)Notification light (At first I didn't think much of this but after having the phone for a while its a feature thats really grown on me. While I'm at work I can tell if I've gotten a new email, text, or missed call by simply looking over at the phone)Flash (nuff said)Some cons:Heats up (It can get pretty hot after using it for a while, even after you buy a case for it)The buttons at the bottom (they aren't very sensitive so you have to hit them dead on for them to work)The volume rockers line up with the power button (sometimes I accidentally press them both when I want to lock the screen or increase volume)None of the cons I listed are anywhere near enough to distract from the great experience you get from the phone. After having an iPhone for the past two and a half years coming to android is a breath of fresh air. It feels like I can really make my phone unique and tweak it completely to my liking.

However, I wanted in on the great looking Droid phones and after bypassing the HTC Evo 4G, I waited many months for the Epic 4G Touch to hit the US market. Now that I own one, here's what I've found:*The Good:. Beautiful screen. Super, super fast OS. Smooth scrolling. Quite customizable. Lots of free apps to download. Call quality is decent - *when* you can get signal (I'm on Sprint). Easy to move contacts over from other phones (BBerry, in my case) via Google sync.. Excellent photo/camera quality. Pretty good speakers (even though it's on the back of the phone, so unless you put the phone on its face (which will scratch the screen), you will hear muffled sounds*The Bad/Ugly. Horrible, HORRIBLE data reception. Barely 1-bar, if that, and constant drops in data speeds (-106 is the norm) in a 4G-capable area. I've tried to send a tweet and it's still \"sending\" 45 minutes later. Seriously.. Poor battery life - I had to recharge the battery every 5 hours, with very little usage. However, I suspect the battery may have drained faster because of the poor service reception, and the phone always searching for a signal.I've moved locations, walked around indoors and out, and to places where my 2-years old BlackBerry would normally get amazing reception, and this one still barely breaks 1.5 bars. I've called Sprint about this and they have their usual excuses (tower, new phone, give it time [so you can be stuck with the phone - yea, right!]), but researching the issue with other owners of the phone and through the Sprint community message board, I see that reception and connectivity is a huge problem for many Epic 4G users (just Google \"reception issues galaxy S2\" and you'll find pages worth of complaints). I did go up on the rooftop of my office building and all the way up there, the reception was great...and even Netflix streamed fantastically well. But I neither live nor work on rooftops, so on ground level, reception is poor (and my area usually gets amazing reception with other phones, including 4G).I also went to the Sprint store today and was told that \"some\" people had come in with similar reception issues. I was also told the same by Sprint tech support over the phone tonight. The phone is 1 week old in the U.S. market, and it's already having reception issues? Not good.I love the phone's look. The screen is INCREDIBLE. I love how fast the OS is and, of course, I'm enjoying all the bells and whistles. BUT, what's the point of a phone that can't even make/receive calls or send a tweet in today's phone market, because of poor reception? (Yes, one might blame Sprint but read the rest of my comment). Some Epic 4G hopefuls are saying Samsung has promised a \"fix\" but those coming from the Samsung Nexus say they had the same issue with reception and Samsung promised fixes, but never delivered. This sounds like a radio issue and/or a problem with the hardware, not with the data carrier (for once!). I live in a 3G/4G area that has otherwise excellent reception, so why would it suddenly drop calls/not receive data on this phone?I'm sad that this phone won't work for me, but I need regular data access on my phone, otherwise I wouldn't buy a smartphone. Based on the issues with reception, I would not recommend this phone to others. However, with regular reception, the phone most likely would be pretty amazing.**UPDATE: Spoke to Sprint again yesterday and they finally acknowledge that reception is now a \"known issue\" with this phone. They \"hope\" a software fix from Samsung will improve it, but believe it is a hardware issue (antenna), so they suggested I return the phone and try another model. Sad, as I otherwise love the phone. If I could get reception, I'd keep it. As it is, no reception = pretty brick.**UPDATE 2: I returned the phone.

I was close to the window and, while the iPhone 4S showed the location with speed and precision, the Galaxy S2 took much longer to show a completely off position (I mean like a mile away).During 3 days I repeatedly compared the performance against the iPhone 4S, and the result was always the same: the iPhone picked up the location much faster and with far more accuracy than the Galaxy S2.Only when you are out in the clear (with literally nothing above you) the GPS reading was reliable. A simple roof is enough to mess the reception.The GPS problem alone trumped all the good things this android phone has to offer: swype, good implementation of google maps, seamless integration with google services, big screen (by the way, the 4S screen is better.

I had an EVO before, and when I pick that one up now it seems small and dull, and the display seems grainy compared to the Epic.  In fact, as long as you are only looking at it, the Epic is a great phone.  It is when you pick it up and actually start using it that the impressions start to dim.  The plastic back is a little cheap-feeling.  I wish it had some texture to it instead of being shiny slick plastic.Then you turn it on and things really start to go downhill.  I should say that I actually had another Samsung phone a few years ago, and decided after that experience to never buy another Samsung phone due to the user experience.  Obviously, I forgot that vow until I bought this phone, but was immediately reminded of it after a few hours with it.The ridiculous little annoyances that just don't have to be there include (so far):1. while the rest of the world has standardized on 2.5mm audio jacks, this thing uses 3.5mm jacks, meaning that I either can't use my current headphones, or maybe that I should never have bought this phone in the first place.2. a camera with shutter sounds and beeps that cannot be turned off. A little annoying when I am trying to take pictures of my daughter's dance recital or piano recital.  If I had a dedicated camera that made this much noise, I'd return it as defective.  Even 3rd party camera apps can't seem to silence this thing's shutter.3. when I imported my google contacts and facebook contacts, it created two separate contacts for people who were in both.  The last phone I had was smart enough to realize that I don't actually know 2 *different* people named Joe Blow with the same phone number and address.  Actually, some of these people are also on Skype and LinkedIn, compounding the problem immensely.4. the vlingo app that comes installed leaves a lot to be desired.  It actually recognizes my voice just fine, but in one instance when I said \"call joe blow at work\" it said 'I found 4 matches, which one did you mean?' and then presented me with a list to choose from that consisted soley of the name joe blow repeated 4 times.  No other information to help me decide which one to pick.  All of this while driving down the road.  And what was the thinking behind having 2 separate voice recognition apps that do basically the same things, but slightly different?  Voice Command is the one for calling and texting, but not for opening apps, and Voice Talk is the one I can actually speak  commands into.  Or the other way around...  The one thing I think I have right is that Voice Command is the one I can just start talking to, and Voice Talk is the one I can't just talk to.  Or the other way around...  Sheesh!5. while I'm non the subject of vlingo, in my contact list Jane Blow happens to have 2 work numbers, and I can't seem to call her at work without a major hassle.  If I say \"call jane blow at work,\"  vlingo says \"I found multiple numbers.  did you mean ...\" and then it goes through the entire list of ALL Jane's numbers (home, mobile, both fax numbers (!!!), not just the 2 work numbers), and I can't seem to get it to shut up until it is has gone through the whole list.  Then I say \"work one\" and it says \"okay, calling jane blow at work\" (note that it mockingly leaves off the \"one\" like I said when I started this whole process).  Same thing happens if I start with \"call jane blow at work one\".  Even screaming it doesn't seem to help.  Trust me, I've tried...6. I used to use my phone's alarm clock to wake up in the morning.  I'm not sure I'll do that any more.  This thing gives you a configurable snooze option, which is nice, but I think I'd really have to be clear-headed and wide awake in order to operate the screen that is displayed when the alarm actually goes off.  I am basically presented with 2 circles, one with an \"X\" in it, the other with a \"Z\" in it, both the same size and on opposite sides of the screen.  The object of the game is to pick one of these circles while still half asleep and bleary-eyed and drag it to the miiddle of the screen.  Actually, because the 'middle of the screen' is right next to the other circle, in practice you really end up dragging one circle on top of the other one.  So, unless you are already wide awake you are likely going to be manipulating both circles.  Then, if you intended to drag the \"Z\" circle, you are supposed to try to go back to sleep and trust that you did it all correclty.  Or else, you just turned the alarm completely off and you are going to be late for work.  Fun game.  Like a video game with real-world consequences.7. I also used to use my phone with a 3rd party program to track my location and send text messages in some particular instances.  This functionality no longer works now that I have this phone.  I suppose this COULD be a problem with the 3rd party app, but given everything else I think it is more likely that Samsung just did something \"hinky\" with its API for contacts.8. Don't even get me started on the desktop dock (sold separately).  It is a nice piece of hardware, good looking and sold, but it is practically useless for use at work.  It has an audio jack in the back that is apparently useless for phone calls.  So, if you are listening to your music and a phone call comes in... well, I'm not sure what you are suppsoed to do.  The dock has a speaker in it (which would be a nice feature if the user had any control over its use), and while docked the phone defaults to speaker mode, but who wants that at work?  I'm in a cubicle, which is why I was using the headphones in the first place.  Jeez, put a little thought into your product design.  Not to mention the annoying special home screen that pops up whenever I dock the phone.  I can make it go away with a button press, but there doesn't seem to be any way to tell it not to pop up in the first place.  Just one more little annoyance that detracts from the whole user experience of this phone.So far I have been terribly disappointed with this phone in use.

On the HTC I was used to hitting my talk button on Pro Voyager bluetooth and saying \"Call Michele\" and it called my wife every time.

This was my first Droid phone, and I was very excited about my purchase. This was also a early Christmas present, my wife and I purchased for each other (I bought 2 phones).  The phone itself was excellent, the display is beautiful, it was easy to use and fit nicely in my pocket.  I purchased $100 in accessories for each phone in addition.  The case I purchased was a nice rubber non slip case which helped to give my phone some stability while it was in my hand.Upon receiving the phones I initially had trouble activating them both so I called tech support and was told to go to my local sprint store to have them activated. I went to the sprint store and although they were able to activate them without an issue the guy at the store was irritated by the fact that I purchased them online and not from a local store.  He had a very poor attitude, and was not interested in answering any of my questions.  I showed interest in purchasing a screen protector, but he was too busy watching a movie off his flash drive on the store computer to do anything more than a three minute activation, and physically point in the direction of the screen protectors.  Because I was being received so poorly, I decided to leave and went to Radio Shack where they were enthusiastic about helping me, helped me to pick the screen protector I was looking for, and even installed it for free!I brought the phones home and began using them.  Locally the service was OK.  I live in upstate, New York which is not really upstate at all unless you are from New York City.  I am 35 minutes from NYC, not much of a stretch.  The service was spotty compared to Verizon which I have had for years; Verizon worked flawlessly locally and pretty good at my house.  I decided to go to Sprint because of the free data plan, as I was impressed by my friends Driod, and was interested in incorporating all the laptop like qualities of the phone into my personal life.  Verizon's plans are more expensive but this is a typical case of \"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!\"  As I had mentioned service was OK locally, spotty at times, and absolutely no 4G up here at all.  My friends Verizon phone gets 4G no problem in this area.  The real problems began at home.  Initially, I had gone to a different Sprint store and was told I would get \"good-fair\" service at my house, which I felt was acceptable considering the Verizon service AT MY HOUSE was not much better.  They took a look at this stupid little service map that suggested service would work in my location.  I did not purchase a phone from them at that time because they wanted me to pay full price for both phone and amazon was selling them for far less.  At the initial recommendation of \"SPRINT\" I purchased two phones expecting service at home.  Well there was ABSOLUTELY NO SERVICE WHAT SO EVER AT MY HOUSE.  Happy with my new phone itself and mesmerized by the display I spent Three (3) days walking around my home trying to find somewhere to set the phone so I could get at least one bar to receive phone calls, and then I could drive a couple miles up the road to call the person back if it was of any importance.  In hind sight that would have been ridiculous, however I was so happy to have this new phone, I did not want to give it up.  UNFORTUNATELY SPRINT WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE ME THE CHOICE.  WHEN A FRIEND SUGGESTED I GIVE THEM A CALL FOR A PHONE BOOSTER FOR MY HOUSE, I MADE THE CALL TO SPRINT TECH SUPPORT AND THIS IS WHAT I WAS TOLD: THEY TOOK A LOOK AT MY ACCOUNT AND TOLD ME THAT WITHIN THE FIRST SEVEN (7) DAYS OF OWNERSHIP MY PHONE HAD ALREADY USED WAY TOO MUCH ROAMING TIME, I WAS COSTING THEM TOO MUCH MONEY, AND THEY WERE GOING TO TERMINATE MY SERVICE AT THE END OF THE MONTH.  THEY GAVE ME THE OPTION OF EARLY TERMINATION AND I TOOK IT SO I DID NOT HAVE TO PAY THE FIRST MONTHS BILL, HOWEVER THEY TOLD ME I HAVE TO RETURN MY PHONES AND EAT THE COST OF THE ACCESSORIES I PURCHASED.  I tried to argue that we have a contract to no avail.  They told me I should move if I want to keep my phone.  I argued once more that their own store told me I would have service at my house, and their response was that this is incorrect,... it is clearly shown on \"the map\" that this is a dead zone, and I should have never been told I would have service at my location... this was clearly no more than a sales tactic.  OVERALL I FOUND BOTH THE LOCAL STORES AT MY LOCATION AND TECH SUPPORT TO BE UNFRIENDLY, UNHELPFUL, AND DOWNRIGHT CONDESCENDING!  I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN AND URGE OTHERS TO LOOK ELSEWHERE.  Worst part of this whole ordeal is that I was out of contact on my Verizon phone which I was paying only $40 per month for and had unlimited texting on.

If there were a chance to SUE Sprint or SAMSUNG, I wouldn't definitely jump on that boat.THERE's absolutely NO Way I would give anything other than 1 star if the phone is this UNRELIABLE.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Galaxy S II Epic Touch 4G", "Author": "Sodone", "ReviewID": "R2Z1XEUB3AY4S0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchase 2 Galaxy phones back in September when they first came out.  Phones menu button keeps popping up at the worst times.  It happens on and off and never in the sprint store.  The phone will ring and as soon as I pick it up the screen goes black so I can not swipe it.  I tried to return it 29 days later but was told sprint change their contracts and now you only have 15 days to return a phone.  So ridicules basically I have spent at least 15 hours on this problem and sprint will do nothing because they can not replicate the problem in their shop.  I videoed it but apparently that is not good enough.  Now I am stuck with a phone that does not work well when I need it and a contract for two years.  Daughter had same phone same thing was happening she dropped her phone in the water on vacations and got a new one for $100.  Her new phone does work much better.  I though it may have been a connection issue but her phone works fine and so do the 4 other phones I have with sprint.  I would leave sprint but I am so stuck.  Sprints customer service is terrible these days.  I know so many people who have left them or are leaving them.

Maybe it was all the hype, who knows. Pretty disappointed. Went from full bars at -65, to a dismal -101 in my living room. And that is 3g. No 4g network has ever been found by me (is that just hype too?). The bigger screen is nice, but noticeably lower res. The icons look cartoonish with all that empty real estate around them. The phone is VERY thin. Nice for some, but it gives an impression that it is fragile. Just doesn't feel right in my hand.

Sure, you can make and receive calls .. Great.  But you don't need the most expensive phone made so far to do that.  This phone is as good as a brick to me.  The GPS fails about 80 percent of the time.  About one quarter of those times I can manage to shock it into a GPS lock by using a workaround with a downloaded ap, but most of the time even this doesn't work.  It takes a power cycle or a battery pull.  Right -- even clearing the AGPS cache and reloading AGPS doesn't work.So, you are warned.

My son told me to go with the iphone 4S and I should have listened to him. The people lighting up the message/review boards complaining about AT&T;'s lack of customer service have not dealt with the Nazis at Sprint. They raped me for personal information verification, told me I was approved and then proceeded to hold up my order for a week due to a glitch in their order processing system without ever bothering to notify me. Amazon wireless is also partly to blame but at least they have the excuse of being in \"beta\" phase. Being a VIDEO person, I was willing to sacrifice not having \"SIRI\" or \"Friend Finder\" for the sake of the Epic's screen + resolution but it was not worth the frustration and I will be returning it to SPRINT and cancelling my contract to go with a company who is not inherently evil, rude and intrusive.

I don't own the phone but I went to a Sprint store and played around with it and here's my opinion:1) CHEAP build quality. The phone feels like a toy in your hands. There is nothing solid about this phone except the glass.2)Too wide. This phone is really wide. It makes it look like you are holding an internet tablet up to your ear. Who wants that?3) It's nothing but the Samsung Infuse...on a smaller scale. Ask AT&T; how that phone is doing for them. They can't give it away.4)Samsung has a history of NOT putting out the Android updates for their phones. I use to won a Epic 4G which is still running on Android 2.2...which is why I got rid of it. I have friends who have the Samsung Captivate and it's still running 2.2(YIKES). One of my co-workers said he had to send his phone back to Samsung just to get it updated to the 2.2 and it took 4 weeks to get his phone back. AT&T; could not update the phone. Can you believe that. The Samsung Infuse is still running on Android 2.2(call AT&T; if you don't believe me or just check Samsungs website). By the time Samsung catch up and get the Android 2.3....the Android Ice Cream Sandwich will be released(which is suppose to be in Oct or Nov-2011)5)Sure the phone is fast and has the dual core processor...but so does the Photon, Evo 3d, HTC Sensation, and The Nexus.In my opinion the BEST Android phone on the market right now as we speak is the Motorola Photon. Bar NONE! Here is how it's better than the Galaxy S2:1) The Photon is a World phone2) The Build quality is way better3) Sleek- the Galaxy S2 is boring to look at4) 16GB internal- The Galaxy S2 is only 85) better screen resolution. regardless of the fact that the Galaxy S2 has the Super OMLED....does not matter the Photon screen is better. I've tested them both.6) Better updates- Samsung record on updates SUCK!!! and since Google has purchased Motorola Mobile....guess who's gonna get the updates first??? you guessed it....Motorola phones and Google Nexus. Therefore Samsung will still be left behind.7) Last but not least.....customer service. Motorola is MUCH better than Samsung when it comes to customer service.Trust me...the only phone that can rival the iphone right now is the Photon. But the iphone does not have a dual core processor or a 4.3 inch screen...which is one reason why the Photon is better than the iphone.If you don't care about the newest Android updates to your phone and don't care about build quality and good customer service along with good call quality....then by all means go out and buy the Galaxy S2. But if those things matter to you...look elsewhere like at the Photon, iphone, or the HTC phones.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$219.99", "Features": "No Contract\nReady to be Activated\nSprint White Epic Touch", "Name": "Samsung Epic 4G Touch Galaxy S II No Contract 8MP Android Smartphone - White Sprint", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Blvu1GuwL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008DGSODI"}}
