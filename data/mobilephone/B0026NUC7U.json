It's a good basic phone and easy to use. My daughter said it has great rings tones and she loved it. The reviews say that it does not have a lot of memory so if you will be using it more to save pictures and music, etc. This may not be the one for that purpose. However, please note that it is not described as a dual band phone which means that it will only work in North America. We wanted to use this in Asia and I confirmed with Nokia that this model will not work there so I returned it to Amazon.", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nokia's bread and butter category scores another win.", "Author": "R. Stec \"GLTPWR\"", "ReviewID": "R107IF0RSXZTH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nokia has always done two things well: low end phones that prove to be reliable for years and high-powered smart phones with innovative features.  The 2680 fits into the former, and I purchased mine in March 2009.  The phone was used on a daily basis and met my expectations for reliability, plus it was purchased through the Nokia USA website, which, unlike many unlocked phones, meant that I had a proper support line, along with a guaranteed 1 year warranty and full support for my wireless carrier (T-Mobile).  The phone is now used as a back-up when I go biking or running (activities that I do not want to subject my 5530 to).  There isn't much to talk about with this phone because of its lower end features, but the VGA camera has a surprisingly good autofocus, the Snake game included is amazing (as Snake always has been), and the radio gets better reception than our B&K; receiver, Sony and Timex alarm clock, and the numerous Zen, GoGear, and Walkman players around the house.  Plus (and probably the most important feature of this product for its intended audience), the call quality is excellent, proving far more clear than the Samsung Behold and Samsung T219 in the house, although about on par with a Blackberry 8820 (alas, GSM Blackberries use Nokia cellular radios).  I highly recommend, especially at the current price of $[...] on the [...] website.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "the phone work properly", "Author": "JOSE LUIS HUESO VASQUEZ", "ReviewID": "REJ0VPSIYN3H6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the phone have so small internal memory, and doesnt have external memory ,but for the chip phone price is ok", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone is great, came with dead battery", "Author": "Joleen Multari", "ReviewID": "R1KZEUF2MWFU5F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like this phone a lot.  When you just need a phone for phone calls, it's compact, light and easy to use with a number of features.  I purchased it as a back up phone to use a bit down the road, as my current phone(same model) was starting to wear out.  When I received it, I put the simm card and battery from my current phone in it to test it out.  It worked fine.  Silly me, I didn't charge up the battery that came with it to see if that worked.  Now, several months later when I started to use it, I discovered that the battery is completely dead and no good.  Oh well, a word to the wise, check out the battery when you buy a new phone.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Review", "Author": "Jacqueline Johnson", "ReviewID": "R29X5TM4FD6QV7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Didnt like the fact that it was quad band, so far it is doing what it is expected to do and I am looking forward to using it fully.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia 2680 review", "Author": "Trinab35", "ReviewID": "RGAK8SVKR4Y0G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone was great except it was missing the multimedia setting so that I could send and receive pics.

The slider function is not easy to get used to and is frustrating at times such as when you want to remove the battery cover.  The phones buttons are also quite small and the phone feels a bit heavy.  Also, because it's not a flip phone, it's very easy to accidentally press the talk or hang up buttons when phone is in your pocket or bag.  You can lock the keypad but that's a pain in the neck as you must keep pressing unlock when prompted on screen.The phone is also the slowest phone in terms of response after you press any menu button. It take almost 2 seconds after you press menu button for a response.  The temptation is to hit the button again, and if you do you might go somewhere you don't want to be and incur a charge. The quality feel of the phone is not bad.  Sound quality is fair at best.  Overall, this is the worst Nokia I've owned.  I also have the Nokia 2720 and it's far better in every category.  Feels lighter too.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Voice Dialing!", "Author": "Fireball", "ReviewID": "R1I1XX3LXV98UE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone would've made sense except for the fact that it has no voice dialing (a feature that comes with many free phone offers).
