I owned a samsung admire which would freeze up a lot and got rid of it . later bought a huawei m835 and this phone was quicker then my 4g phones . Only problem I had with it is downloading any app over 10 meg it would not play them . But for youtube it was quicker with no lag at all no matter what the signal was . I liked this phone for watching movies real loud sound . Then I got the huawei activa this phone would drop calls and loose internet connection quickly . Also bought a coolpad quattro 4g this phone was probably the best one of the bunch but it would freeze up a lot . Just take out the battery and go on . Finally bought another huawei m835 because except.for downloading everything.else work great . I have now lately bought myself a LG Optimus M+ . I wish I had bought this phone a while back.as.it.does.everything.great plus it has plenty of memory no lag at all very fast on everything . I have 98 movies and have loaded a.lot of.games . I would say this phone is better then some of the 4g phones out there . My wife bought a.4g phone with duel processers of 1500 . She likes mine.better as hers drops calls and the screen goes black while.making a call . The lg optimus m+ does everything well . I have to admitt.I finally found a.real good phone .", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple yet very effective phone.", "Author": "Pablo", "ReviewID": "R3NY8FOFKJ3M3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Owner of the Optimus for about a year at this point. The LG Optimus M+ is a great phone for normal users. The phone has not lost its ability to lost its charge even though I have put it through its paces for the past year. Calls and messages are simple and straightforward, no issues with mic or speaker performance. The camera and video functions work well and the flash is also effective. The phone works on Metropcs's 3G network, long ago people would say Metropcs is not up to the task but I gotta say, their 3G network is very SOLID at this point. Only times the 3G weakens is inside schools or hospitals(as you know, they use thick concrete walls). Overall this phone works very well. If you are a normal phone user(calls/messages/light web surfing) this phone wont dissapoint you.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG at is best", "Author": "William Sosa", "ReviewID": "RANGOS5054BJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone! it glides perfectly, it feels very smooth. the shape is great for us guys and it looks very executive. will buy again and again!", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome for a 3g!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R24556ZGSLDVAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has more ram than any 3g phone.

Stay FAR AWAY.", "Author": "Synthesis", "ReviewID": "R10ITXFXCFFLLN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If I knew the world of insanity I was getting into when I first bought this phone, I wouldn't of even bothered. I'd probably not even use a phone altogether, which is what I'm honestly considering.First of all, I was SERIOUSLY ripped off with this thing. The seller sold it for $150. I didn't know the plan I was signing up for allowed me to use a used phone (which is probably what I got, despite buying a new one) which I probably could've gotten for $10. I even asked the guy to take the phone back. Of course not. On to the problems:Here's a list of all the problems I've had with this piece of junk:- It freezes. CONSTANTLY.- Messages don't send half the time, and when they do, the chance the recipeient receives a million copies is staggeringly high.- Almost every aspect of the phone, every single app, has failed in some way or another. Literally NOTHING WORKS THE WAY IT SHOULD.- The camera doesn't work.- Ringtones get reset after plugging into a computer.- Half the time, the phone never rings. I won't even get a notification that someone called me.- The stock keyboards are utter junk, and all the third party ones either don't work or are glitch.- My alarm works 50% of the time.- Want to root your phone? Sure, but you can't flash any ROMs to it. I tired.- Battery life lasts three hours with use, maybe. If you're lucky.- Just today, my phone decided it wanted to delete some files off my SD card for no reason. 90% of my pictures, wallpapers, and ringtones. Gone for literally no reason.- No front facing camera? Why not?- Why is the speaker on the BACK of the phone? When it's lying screen up, it's completely inaudible.- Almost every time I go to call someone, no audio.- Wifi is mind numbingly slow.I'm switching to Ting as soon as I get some money. I'm not using this junk of a phone anymore.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG Optimus", "Author": "Mary Petrone", "ReviewID": "R206WBYB8UYPLJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first foray into the smart phone field was an ultra cheap Coolpad, offered by Metro PCS.  This phone was replaced three times in six months and then worked for a little while.  When I finally decided that I was a smart phone user, I went back to the Metro PCS store to see what my options were.  I could get another cheapo phone, a lower middle end LG or jump up to spending >$400 on a phone and some well over $600.  I opted for a step up and went with the LG.  It has been problem free since purchase several months ago and I am very happy with the LG.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "A+", "Author": "F U", "ReviewID": "R2BT5I2T9Z8AU0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "MY SON LOVES IT!

Supported by a 65mps internet service (home wifi).Battery: 12 hours standby on wifi/ 16 hours standby without wifi/ 5-6 hours excessive talk and text(with/without wifi) / 7-8 hours excessive text (with/without wifi). Tested on low-mid screen brightness.Call Quality: Superb. Only lack in call quality is in poor reception or the outgoing phone.Speaker Volume: Crisp and clean. Really loud in a quiet room. Slightly quiet with over 20-25 people talking over each other.GPS: Very fast on wifi. Can still track without wifi, but cannot relocate if you miss your exit/turn.Gaming: great for moderate gaming. Nothing to intense and can only support games built for Gingerbread. Still playing all facebook apps and etc.Picture capture: Great quality when focused, and blurry when unfocused. Flash is super bright!Picture viewing: can view photos over 1600x900 (re-sized when viewed but makes great wall paper).Video Recording: Records amazing @480P. Flash can be enabled during recording. Great Plus!Media Video: 480P maximum. Still great quality on youtube.Music: can be played if apps allow the music player to be used. Music player can however use a more friendly interface. Thus the toolbar for the music player is amazing. Any music sound file will play in the music media player witch can be a good or negative.External SDcard cap:32gb and the phone reads it like a charm. can set pictures/videos to be stored on card to save phone space.Overall a great phone and a must buy if you are a first time smart phone purchaser or looking for a replacement. This has all the kinks. Scrolling is still smooth like butter. Better then the SG3,4, and note IMO. No cracks yet (thank lord). Dropped from stock truck height (4 feet) face down and no scruffs about 5 times now. Froze 4 times but only at my fault. Only thing i didnt like about it was the 160 character text limit before it converts to a multimedia file, but it is common in all android phone due to the system software, so no grudge hold on this phone.
