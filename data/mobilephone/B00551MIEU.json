The phone I received had a TMobile logo which made me suspicious as to whether the phone was really unlocked.  My suspicions came out to be true.  I used this phone with SIM cards from UK, Holland, and India.  The phone feature worked with no issues, however, having the internet and data services to work was a nightmare and wasted a lot of time.  In each country I had to go the service supplier in the country and have them adjust the settings.  In UK one of the service suppliers was never able to make the phone work for data services.  Every now and then the TMobile applications shows up interfering with the use.  The product is not what it says and claims it to be.  It seems that the phone was a \"TMobile\" phone subsequently unlocked by the seller or somebody else.  Although I was able to get a discount from Amazon (related to accessory package being damaged) which I appreciated very much but overall I am extremely disappointed and would soon be exploring return of the phone.  If you are looking for the TRUE unlocked feature do NOT buy this phone.  If the phone comes with logo of any service provider like \"TMobile\" in my case simply return it to be on the safe side.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone great price", "Author": "Raj N", "ReviewID": "R23JIZI141T67B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say this is a great phone as I expected, I received it in a T mobile box and unlocked.I purchased this from Flux Electronics, very courteous service.Surely recommend this.

Robey", "ReviewID": "R39T5DWBNNOTON", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My first HTC phone was an HTC Touch Pro and I loved that phone! I recently wanted to ditch an iPhone that was given to me for this phone. I researched HTC phones and the Sensation was reasonably priced and had the features I needed, so I ordered it....along with an extra battery, because I'm a tech who is usually away from a power outlet for extended amounts of time and I read reviews that suggested doing so. I even got a charging dock for work.I'll admit it, I was VERY ready to rid myself of the ridiculous iPhone. After a month of having the HTC Sensation, I found that I'd jumped from the frying pan, into the fire. I have to keep this phone charging, because the batteries do not last half a day (with moderate use and with more than half of the services and apps stopped). Even with charging for four hours, there is less than half of the battery life left. I don't understand this! I have left my iPhone in my bag, on standby, for a week and still had 20% of the battery life left...with all services running in the background.Second, it takes an entire FIVE MINUTES for this phone to boot-up and/or reboot. When I'm working with a client and the phone reboots for no particular reason, it is annoying to have to wait FIVE MINUTES for to make a call or check e-mail.Oh, and forget wi-fi. I can't turn a corner at the gym or I lose the wi-fi signal, while the horrible iPhone could hold a wi-fi signal all the way to my car in the gym's parking lot.On a \"nit-picky\" note, there is no notepad application resident on the Android Gingerbread OS and that is annoying. I shouldn't have to install a 3rd party application, when other OS's come with this standard. Ridiculous!I actually made a mistake, because I thought I was ordering a Sensation that was not affiliated with paticular carrier, but it came with a T-Mobile stamp on it.Oh, and lastly, don't even mention Ice Cream Sandwich...it's almost June and it was rumored to be slated for April.I like my phone, but I'll probably never love it!", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Impressive phone but cant get to work on at&t; network", "Author": "Hiker \"Hiker\"", "ReviewID": "R2HPFLIC8QW5FD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "impressive phone.
