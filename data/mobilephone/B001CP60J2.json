The C702 has everything and more than any of the other most sophisticated cell phones can have!  It has GPS and A-GPS capabilities, a great 3.2 MP picture camera, video-recording camera, lighting for both camera modes, GPS-based navigator, Bluetooth capabilities, micro memory card slot, GSM and 3G capabilities, water resistant shell, anti-slip back cover, e-mail, MMS, text, digital radio, MP3 player, and so much more!  One of the features that I really like is the ability to connect to the Internet from a computer through the C702 and its included Sony Ericsson PC Suite software.  I couldn't have wished for a better cell phone!  Don't believe everything bad that people say about this cell phone.  Judge for yourself, if you dare!", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony Ericsson w/cyber shot", "Author": "Amanda Latham", "ReviewID": "R1HUS3VS677KZK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone while in Kuwait about 6 months ago, first problem I noticed was that the slide cover for the camera keep coming open, still does. The pictures I take with it come out pretty clear, so that's a plus. Sometimes though the phone will freeze up and I will have to shut it down, sometimes the screen will just go black. I bought this phone because I was told it will work with my carrier back in the states (AT&T;). I have not been back to the states to test it out yet, but I think I will just use this as a deployment/emergency phone, and keep my Sony Ericsson 750, that one has yet to give me ANY issues and I've had it for over a year!", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.99", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
