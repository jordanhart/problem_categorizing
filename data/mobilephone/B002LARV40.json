It was a huge mistake.  I had the phone only a few months when the flimsy plastic battery cover began falling off.  I taped the cover back on and figured I would live with it.  A few months later the phone began to feel unstable when opened.  Earlier this week the entire top of the phone (screen portion) snapped off when I opened it to make a call.  The phone is less than a year old and was not dropped or exposed to anything more than normal wear and tear.  I have replaced it with my old standby the Pebl U6--a heavier, but much more durable phone.  Do not waste your money on such a flimsy phone.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "H.
