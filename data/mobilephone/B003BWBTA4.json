{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little phone", "Author": "Liam", "ReviewID": "RTZQRGQUDFW9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I struggled to find a flip phone for sale through conventional outlets - they no longer seem very popular. I found details of this on the Sony Ericson website and it did everything I wanted (2G + 3G, MMS, Bluetooth, camera). Sony E had discontinued it so bought it via Amazon. Works great and comes with software that allows you to connect your PC to the web via GPRS or 3G (you do need data services to be enabled with your air-time provider). If you want a small phone that doesn't randomly dial number when it's in your pocket I'd recommend this.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful phone, but not for everyone", "Author": "vtunie", "ReviewID": "R3EJD2T7UMHRFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There used to be this opinion that in technology smaller is better.  Especially for mobile phones. Obese lifestyles call for bigger devices, I suppose, but if your style is still of the old school and if you are on the right network, with some caveats this is the phone for you.  Since it is exactly what I want, I am very happy with it.It's supposed to be a smart phone.  And it IS smart, both in looks and in function.The package I got came with earphones and a European-plug charger.  I was warned about this, and so invested in a European-to-N.American plug converter, and a USB data cable.  I also invested in a new 4gig memory card, and reused my old bluetooth earpiece.  Packaging may vary, so check very carefully what comes in the package you are getting.I bought it unlocked and dropped in the memomy card and the SIM from my prepaid old phone on the Rogers network in Canada.  Initial charging was very quick, taking no more than an hour to reach full battery capacity.  First time I turned on the phone a few initial-configuration screens came up; the most complicated setting was to get the time zone info to update automatically from the network. Once the initial configuration was done, I entered a few easily-googleable settings for custom streaming and data connections, and I had the smallest 3G phone in the city.  Everything worked as advertised. :)Charging time is quick -- about four hours from empty -- and the battery lasts about a week, seven days, if you turn the phone off at night but leave it on all day.Dialing on the small buttons is surprisingly easy if you don't have wide fingers.  I thought mine weren't small, but I've had far fewer mishits than on my old Samsung J706.Answering the phone is particularly easy since I have a bluetooth earpiece.Voice audio is excellent.  I suppose the choice of network is important, though.The screen is small, but if your eyes can handle it, it is very bright, except in direct sunlight.  The phone is small enough, however, that your hand shades the screen almost automatically.The browsing, app, and game user interfaces the Sony-Ericsson java-os provides are a notch above the competition.  (I have always thought Android and iPhone interfaces were too glitzy to be really usable.)The radio works quite well.  Likewise the music player.  I have read some complaints about sound quality, but for the basic pop I listen to, it's fine.The camera, both still and vid, is of expected cell-phone quality.  Perfectly passable snaps close up and of the landscape on sunny days, a little dreary in overcast light.  Again, though, for the kind of use I would expect from a mobile phone, it's more than sufficient.My one complaint is that no Japanese input method is included with the OS.  This was remedied with a free Java app called BeeperInput (I decompiled it, it looks perfectly safe, and in fact the java platform is a fairly secure one if you're paranoid).  For the occasional texting in Japanese this is enough if you are very patient with the kanji selection, and don't mind a rather intricate copy-and-paste mechanism to get the text into the final texter or browser, as well as simplified-chinese style kanji (the java OS does not allow for custom fonts).  For a few people, I suppose this could be an absolute deal-breaker, but even more will surely not care.Some people have complained about troubles with early OS releases.  To forestall any problems, I immediately installed the accompanying software (downloadable from the Sony Ericsson site; no CD is included) and updated the OS.  The software is extremely intuitive and the update was quick and problem-free.  The first reboot afterward was so slow I began to worry, but eventually the status bar moved and the phone came up.  To my slight annoyance I had to re-enter the initial confuguration and the data/streaming connectivity info.  But I may well have missed a setting to have those restored automatically, I'm not sure.  Anyway, once that was done I have not had any of the dropped-call errors some people with the initial OS seemed to be complaining about.  (Again, I suppose in part that might be a network issue.)Sony-Ericsson's content management software is superb, I think.----So, overall:the PROS:  size if you love it small; looks; functionality; sound quality; associated software.the CONS:  package does not include everything and some one-time or two-time configuration is required.  No Japanese text built-in, and the one available solution to that is a little clunky though free.I do not consider the cons any more than a minor one-time annoyance, and the pros are so overwhelming that I give five stars without hesitation.  But I realize some people will look for a different feature set.", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "unlocked phones, unlocked phone, GSM phone,\nGSM phones, unlocked GSM phones, unlocked GSM phone, unlocked GSM\nphoneQuadband phone, Quad band phones, Quadband GSM phones, Quad band\nworldphones, worldphones, GSM worldphones, GSM worldphones, GSM Unlocked\nworldphones, GSM unlocked  worldphone, Sony Ericson", "Name": "Sony Ericson F-100 (Jalou) Quadband GSM World Celluler Phone(Unlocked)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Y6899AACL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003BWBTA4"}}
