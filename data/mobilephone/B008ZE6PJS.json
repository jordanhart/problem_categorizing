{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Phone But No 4G LTE", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R25PL8PXK28A0X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Rush was a very good 2012 entry level 3G phone that has been replaced by Boost's new 2013 phones with high speed 4G LTE for Boost's new 4G LTE network.Bottom line: as of October 2013, anyone buying a Boost phone should ONLY be looking at the new 4G LTE models.If you read \"one star\" and \"two star\" reviews, you will see people complaining about their Rush \"freezing up\". That problem is caused by filling the internal memory to the brim with apps and not moving apps to the SD card. \"Phone Freeze\" can also be caused by just one \"bad\" app, and the Google Play Store has THOUSANDS of bad apps. When you install a new app, install just one each day. Use that app for a day and verify it works well and causes no problems for your Rush. App freezes your phone? Just uninstall it. If you download five apps a day and your phone freezes up, you don't know WHICH app is misbehaving.The Rush has a smaller screen than most 2013 \"Super Phones\"...it is the size of the screen on the Apple Iphone 4S. For reading email or news on the web, the Rush's screen works very well. Want to watch Netflix movies? You probably will think the Rush's screen is a bit small.Samsung makes tough phones. Odds are, your Rush will survive a fall onto a hardwood floor. But, why take chances? Buy a dual layer \"hybrid\" case with a rubber inner layer and a hard outer shell. Such cases are light, but tough enough to protect your Rush against a fall, even onto concrete. Search Amazon for cases using terms such as \"Hybrid\" or \"dual\" or \"fishbone\" to find the dual layer cases.WARNING: Boost Mobile uses the Sprint Network, and Boost phones do NOT \"roam\" to other networks when you travel beyond the reach of the Sprint \"home\" network. Boost Mobile has a strong network in America's 40 largest cities, and along the major interstate highways that connect those 40 cities. But, there are ENTIRE STATES not served by Boost Mobile...also NOT served are most small towns and rural areas. The Boost Mobile coverage map enables you to \"zoom in\" on the block where you live and where you work to verify the availability of a 3g signal in your neighborhood before you buy a Boost phone.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ideal combination of form, function, and price", "Author": "Petro", "ReviewID": "RGQRH7CPO742S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for a week and it is light, has all the important functionality through android OS, and the sound quality is great.

Lol Actually I'm going to correct myself. Not only can this phone do everything that the iPhone can (Not including Siri)  but you can so much more! Having this phone or any other android will allow to have full ability to customize it to fit your style or tastes!

The touch screen was not consistently responsive, particularly the phone keypad (the \"End\" and \"Speakerphone\" buttons) which is downright unacceptable. There were also a lot of other annoying little things I wasn't crazy about, but there are too many to mention. Last week I dropped it and the screen went black, so I bought the \"Rush\" as a replacement.WHAT A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT! I wasn't particularly excited about purchasing this phone in the first place because I really wanted the \"Venice\" which is about $80 more expensive. However, since it was an unexpected expense, I opted for this phone because of the price and decent reviews. I expected this to be like the Prevail, only newer and shinier, but it's not even in the same species as that thing! It seems that Samsung took notice of what was lacking with the Prevail and made changes accordingly. All the things that I hated about the other phone have been remedied here and I am so happy about it. It is such a responsive, intuitive little thing and I couldn't have been more surprised. It is so much more sophisticated and user-friendly than what I have been used to. Other than a bigger screen, I can't imagine how much better the \"Venice\" could have been. I'm sure it's also an amazing phone, but for the price this one is just great.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC!", "Author": "4 Ms. Marion", "ReviewID": "RJG26SW1W78YA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has everything you need.

We have always had pay-as-you go phones, because we have never had the desire to be under contract for cell service. We also refuse to pay a ridiculous price for a cell phone.To tell you how frugal we are, this is the first Smartphone that either one of us has EVER owned! We were ready to up-grade, but we just refused to pay $100 or much more for a cell phone!I found this phone on here brand-new for $49.99, so we decided we may as well give this phone a chance because we needed new phones and replacing the phones we had would cost about as much as this phone, if we replaced our phones with the same model we were already using!We really weren't expecting much for the low price so we were very pleasantly surprised! These phones are FABULOUS! My sister has a $400 Galaxy S3 and in my opinion this phone is just as good and does just as much!Unlimed everything for this phone is $55 per month, plus tax.This phone can have LOTS of apps installed and not slow down. It is perfect for surfing the web, watching movies, playing games, checking in on your favorite social sites, playing music and so much more! This phone is like a computer that will fit in your pocket! It is perfect for the things that we need to do online, which is great because we have no use for paying an internet bill since we have these phones! There are LOTS of FREE apps for this phone, and that includes popular game apps such as \"Candy Crush Saga\" and other popular games from social sites!We LOVE this phone! We are so happy that we each got one. In my opinion you will not find a better Smartphone on the market at a price like this!!!", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great at first", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R148GY6B15FBRV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was a really good phone.......at first.

Phone didn't lag one bit, or bog down when a few apps were running at the same time. But what sold me on the phone to purchase for her was the fact it had WiFi. which gave her the option to be able to check her important stuff on a hot-spot at a coffee house or restaurant without pulling out her laptop for a quick jot on Facebook, and her other social media without being required to have a data plan with boost, or sprint. I'm not so much a camera junkie, she seems to be a picture-holic :p. Seemed to have a fairly decent quick camera for decent photos. Nothing you can consider to be \"professional\" but functional with a few or several quick-shots to share with people on Facebook and her other social media outlets. I wish i had more to tell you about the phone, but that seems to be the \"only details\" I could pry out of her from the excitement. I'll followup in a few months and see where this phone pans out.

This phone is better than what I expected. You just have to have the phone in your hand to see what Im talking about. Its kinda heavy ( which is what I wanted ) not light at all. Its not huge but its decent size. When I watch movies on my Netflix they come in so clear! The volume is loud. when you play music its louder than what you expected. Its a really nice phone! I totally recommend it!!The Bad-  I got a bad phone! My phone does not charge correctly. I have to play with it to get it to charge. The screen freezes up on me from time to time ( which drives me crazy!!)The battery life is okay. I mean I go on my phone alot so it runs quick. My sister has the same phone for a couple of months before me and she has had NO problems at all.

In fact, the Rush is like a mini Galaxy III (without 4G).  The Rush has a clear, vibrant screen with good resolution, smooth and fluid scrolling, and no lag.  It's speed is good, and the screen is responsive.  Coming from a Galaxy III, I do not notice any deficiency due to lack of 4G.Now, onto the negatives.  The BATTERY LIFE is abysmal.  You will need to employ the power saver function, in addition to installing a battery saver app from Google Play.  Even then, the phone does not hold a charge well.  I am a light to moderate phone user, and I find that I sometimes need to recharge my phone mid-day, even after charging it all night.  There are many reviews across the web that are consistent with this issue...seems to be a widespread problem with this phone.I got it on a good sale, so I'm going to live with it for awhile, and then eventually upgrade to a phone with better battery life.  Do I miss my Galaxy III?  Yes, a little.  But I don't miss being tied to a contract.Also, as with any Boost Mobile phone, be prepared to deal with lots of bloatware, marketing ad pop-ups, and Boost notifications on the phone.  As you work your way around, you will eventually find ways to disable many of these notifications hidden in the respective settings menus.Another peeve I have is the stock keyboard.  It's too small and cramped for accurate input or texting.  I have looked into other keyboard apps in Google Play, but haven't found one to my liking yet.If you decide to purchase this phone, make sure you get a phone case that provides a little bulk and grip.  There are not many good cases available for it.  You can find the best variety on Amazon.  But because it's not a \"premium\" phone, there are no premium cases on the market.If Samsung could resolve the battery issue, this phone would have a lot of potential as a budget Galaxy phone.  If you are prepared to deal with it's deficiences, then I can recommend it if you are able to get it on a good sale or promotion.

I got this idea from @iyaz who bought it to put on games for his kids.I thought it might also be nice to compare the GR against my iPod Touch.(iTouch) - Version 3 I think.- It comes with 1.8 gb free to add apps and movies, but I bought a 16 gb microSD card for around $11 to get more space. I put all my podcasts and videos on the card.- Although I don't want to \"Activate\" the phone, every once in a while it keeps trying to do this and I'd like a way to turn it off.- It  appears that I could make Emergency Calls with this device if needed.- Battery - standard micro-usb rechargeable and replaceable. Nice!- Camera - two very basic - but it does have a flash. You can switch from the front to the rear facing camera. It has a dedicated camera button on the side to quickly take pictures. See the picture below for results - it's only a 3 megapixel picture -but still ok for such an inexpensive device.- Connecting to the computer - the first time you do this, it takes a number of minutes to install the drivers. After that, it's very quick to plug it in and drag and drop files. This capability is one reason I prefer this device over the iTouch. You have to use iTunes to move files with the iTouch.- Flashlight - much brighter than the iTouch since it has the flash capability.- Keyboard - it's better than my standard Nexus 7. Has number and letters together.- Size - approximately the same screen size as my iTouch although a bit thicker.- Skype - this device does have front and rear facing cameras. I've installed Skype and will test it out.- Sound - fairly loud for its size although I'll usually be connecting this to my Jambox or ear phones.- Video - I just watched Netflix and the quality is fine.I prefer using a stylus especially since this device is a bit small.- Apps seem to install easily. I usually choose them on the computer and have them automatically downloaded to my device.Summary - WOW! I'm impressed and so far can't find anything negative to say.You could certainly activate and use this as a phone, but I use it as an inexpensive media device and I'm very happy.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply well done", "Author": "JMF JR \"drummerboy843033\"", "ReviewID": "R3A1BJEC6EAOBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I've had a real lot of phones and a lot of android based phones, and I always hated the way the battery could never keep up with the phones potential, so then i went back to a dumb phone for a while until the Galaxy Rush caught my eye, believe me when I say i research things to death, which is what i did here as well.

So, I should try to fix that.However, since I only had the phone for an hour, I don't think that any rating I would give the phone (good or bad) would be worth anything.I should have pointed out in the beginning of my review, that this review is really about Boost Mobile, and not the phone. Since you have to get this phone for Boost Mobile, I feel this is the right place to warn about Boost Mobile. I'm sorry that I can't provide any more insight into the phone itself.============ Original Post ===============Boost Mobile is UNBELIEVABLY bad: - 2 days ago I signed up for what I thought was a Pay-as-you-go plan (it was called a \"Daily Plan\") - yesterday I discover that they're charging me every day even if I don't use the phone!!!! - I have emailed them 4 times and spoken to 4 different people to try to do the following:  - cancel my service  - turn off my auto-replenish from credit card  - refund any unused funds ($41 of $50 paid) - bottom line:  - a rep was able to cancel my auto-replenish (I was not able to cancel it myself... nor, did any of my emails get it cancelled)  - a manager told me they have no way of refunding my unused funds. Instead I must just wait until the funds get used up (Sherry, employee #WD221097 told me this, and also told me that there was no one above her that I could speak to)  - my credit card customer service rep set up a conference call with me and \"Janis\" from Boost Mobile. Janis refunded my $41 and was very helpful.So, I would be very careful about doing any business with Boost Mobile. Of course I also had much of the normal aggravation that we expect from a customer-ignoring company: recorded messages that don't have the \"cancel service\" or \"speak to a rep\" option; one rep after another that treats you like a 3 year old; managers that can only say \"I'm sorry, that's our policy\".If you do find yourself in dispute with Boost Mobile, don't forget to try your credit card company... they were very effective.I did try the phone for about an hour the first day: it seemed like a nice phone. I liked the small size. It's not as fast as my Samsung S2, but it was acceptable to me. Note that you can't bring this phone to another network provider (I'm not quite sure why... I think it's just a business agreement between the providers... not a technical issue).", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great service", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R1ACL6D3Q9RWM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was a gift for my son.
