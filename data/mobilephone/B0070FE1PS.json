Then when we activated the phone we noticed the speaker was not working. Therefore, the ringer didn't work either!!!! Now this is a HUGE deal!!! How come you are selling a phone that doesn't have a ringer sound??? I bought this phone for my mom who doesn't know how to work a smart phone and she was so frustrated because she was missing all her calls from family, doctors and friends. NOT ACCEPTABLE!

When the phone arrived, my son charged it and when it was convenient for us we drove to make the delivery to my grandson and took it into a Verizon store to activate the phone only to be told it had a low battery problem.  I purchased a new battery from another store, spending more on the battery than I did on the phone (which should have been my first red flag).  My son and I went back home thinking problem had been solved only to receive email from grandson that no matter which charger or outlet was used the phone was not holding a charge. (Second red flag) Of course by this time it's past the two week period to return it to the seller!! (Third red flag) So my son and I decide to simply buy a new phone from Verizon compatible with his current family plan for his son and added the warranty.  At least I was able to get a full refund for the new battery I had purchased for the used phone!! I will NEVER purchase another used cell phone from a seller on Amazon after this experience.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This product has been carefully audited and is certified to be 100% functional.\nThe Motorola KRZR K1m showcases a state-of-the-art glass and metal casing with an internal antenna and hidden audio controls\nThe K1m sports 3G EV-DO data, 1.3 megapixel camera, RAZR inspired styling, multi-format music player, Bluetooth compatibility, mini-USB support, and GPS\nThis model is also equipped with video streaming and MMS/SMS messaging capabilities.
