{"Reviews": [{"Title": "No iPhone but very good smartphone for the price", "Author": "R. Maung", "ReviewID": "R1L466JVOZFBDV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have an iPhone and used to have some kind of Samsung smartphone (I wanted to be deviant and try Windows Phone only to realize Apple knew what they were doing and Windows just isn't good enough for what I need even though phone was excellent and I did like some aspects of Windows system). I bought this Cubot phone because it's unlocked and has two SIM card slots (hey...I'll probably never use both at same time but two is better than one, right?) and a memory card slot (given that they don't provide much memory space on the phone at all). I like the look of it, and it also stated it can be a wireless hotspot, which is what I may need for where I'll be using this phone. So, I bought this phone to use in Myanmar (and perhaps other countries I'll travel in if I do get to travel more). I have not tried in Maynamr yet (which is in Southeast Asia, if you are not familiar with world geography). But I've tried in Canada briefly so I can comment on that experience.It came in beautiful packaging and got all it needed-phone, charger, USB cord, earphones, gel case and of course, battery. Relatively easy to take off back cover to install battery and SIM card and memory card. It is somewhat lightweight plastic for the cover but it doesn't look cheap and won't break at slightest touch. However, I can't say it's built to withstand major destruction. I'm talking about the back cover here.Front face came with a plastic screen liner that has a little label to inform you to take it off after set up. I was worried if I take it off, there won't be a screen protector and wasn't sure if the glass is that sturdy to withstand  scratches, but I took it off anyway and found out a screen protector is already placed underneath that top liner so that's wonderful.The touchscreen is quite sensitive, sometimes a little too much but I rather have that then not at all. Although there is one corner at lower right that seems a bit hard to respond to touch. It's no big deal except when updating apps and you've to press \"accept\" to agreements and the icon to accept so happens to be at that corner.Screen image quality is good. It's not iPhone with its retina display and all that but you really can't tell too much of a difference at all. Camera is so-so. I tried at night with lights on so it might be that. Maybe it's better in daylight. I don't know as I haven't taken pictures in daylight yet. It's not horrible photo. It's better than those initial old school cell phone cameras (remember those flip phones and when it was a big deal to have email just started on those basic phones?). You won't be able to send your photos to National Heographic, that's all I'm saying. Otherwise, it really is not bad.It's user friendly enough and works like any other Android operating system (I have a Samsung galaxy tablet that uses Android). I downloaded and installed apps through wi fi and it was fast enough. I will suggest closing down apps when not using to reduce drag on RAM which sometimes can slow system down and freeze or crash apps, I think. I'm no tech genius but that sort of what I've heard or learned/applied based on my computer usages. You can do this by pressing home icon down for a couple seconds till view do various ongoing apps show up and you just swipe to delete. I think the list icon, which should be the lines icon to the left also does same thing. Sometimes I wonder if people complain about crashes without realizing this issue. I don't think it solves all crashes. Sometimes it's just bugs in app, and sometimes it's just the operating system, and sometimes the phone/device doesn't have sufficient capacity.I did call myself using my iPhone just to test it out (and to test my international SIM card out) but I hung up on myself since I didn't want waste minutes on the prepaid card. At least it rings so that part works. I can't comment on sound quality of call.All in all, I'm pleasantly surprised. I wasn't sure what to expect given its $99 for a smartphone that's unlocked. But it's a travel phone and I didn't want to spend hefty amount for something I'll use only for at most a month out of each year. But it is important to me to be able to have ways of communicating via calls and emails and internet while traveling. I don't need anything fancy but just the basic smartphone. If you are looking for that, then do consider this phone as it's such a great deal. If I have different experience after I come back from. Y Asia trip, I'll post any updates. But if I don't, that means I'm enjoying my phone. I wrote this long because I really do think this phone deserves a good review.

I took the steps to return the phone and sent it UPS all the way back to China to get a phone call from UPS stating there was an additional free of $43 dollars and they were refusing to pay after I already paid about $123 to send it back. I told the lady on the phone that I did not want the phone, but I did ask if there was a fee to return it back to me and of course there was and I told the lady I do not want it, therefore it was left abandoned at the site.
