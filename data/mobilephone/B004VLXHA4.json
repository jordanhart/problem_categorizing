{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent older smartphone if you have an earlier model", "Author": "NMazzoni", "ReviewID": "RGCOXLKTYL808", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Prior to August 2010, the LG VS740 Ally was a great ahead-of-its-time smartphone in many ways.  This was both good & bad.  Because of many features unheard of in many smartphones up to its release date, it quickly became popular and so LG rushed to meet the demand...and failed miserably in the process.  The quality of the rushed LG Allys diminished internally.  Many complaints of DOAs and freezing software and FCs followed and the reputation of the phone plummeted.  This was sad.I've had my Ally since the first week of May 2010 (shortly after it was available in April of 2010) and my only complaint is the tiny size of internal memory on the phone.  It has since been updated to Android 2.2.2* (modified version of FroYo that does not allow Adobe Flash due to the ARM cpu) however, this can be worked around using the Skyfire browser found in the Android Market - and the Android version now allows Apps2SD.So if you purchase or receive a new/refurbed LG Ally that was produced after August of 2010, you may just get a dud.  For more info you can wiki the phone or visit lgallyforums (.) com******UPDATE w more info Feb 23 2012****Hands down, this phone has the very best QWERTY layout of any phone before and currently in the market with a smooth & responsive feel to the buttons after nearly 2yrs of EXTENSIVE txting.  It breaks up receiving walls of texts so that you can see the correct order & what is incoming (i.e 1/6) and long pressing a text opens a window of options where you can lock it, call the #, copy the msg, view msg details, or delete an individual msg.Verizon is to blame for the eventual sluggishness as their crapware that is not removable takes up much needed memory space.  I have had to delete almost all the fun apps I was able to download when I first got the phone simply because the shrinking space will cause the phone to freeze (many complaints on this).  Once I did, however, the phone functions perfectly still.  I have to constantly clear my txt messages as well to keep the memory full warning from annoying me.I am too chicken to root this phone since it works perfectly so long as I manage the space.As of this writing, I only have 4 apps I downloaded that I deemed useful and worthy enough to keep as I had to decide what had to come off to keep the phone from freezing up due to lack of space.  The phone comes with many free and useful apps built-in such as ThinkFree Office, Youtube, Skype Mobile, News & Weather (which is very accurate), Gmail, and a handy and useful Navigator for driving.However, it would be nice if I could also have kept Angry Birds Rio that I downloaded. I had to delete it due to memory issues, but when I had it, the paid version played flawlessly.I kept the following apps: Battle.net Mobile Auth for my WoW accnt, Skyfire & Dolphin HD browsers, and Easy Reminder - atm I only have 8 MP3s & the Skyfire browser loaded on the SD card - transferring data to and from the phone is incredibly easy with dragging and dropping like any windows folder.  I keep an 8GB SD card in it which is a very nice feature as I have saved full movies in .avi format and 3 gigs of songs at one point.  The phone plays movies seamlessly with ZERO stutters and ZERO ghosting! It really was ahead of its time.I will be eligible for an upgrade phone soon and I am dreading it.  Why? Because I want the same phone essentially but with some upgraded specs: exact same QWERTY slider but with duocore or faster cpu, the same BRIGHT CRISP SAMOLED Plus HD - at least a 4.3 scrn w Gorilla Glass, at least an 8megapixel cam, 16GB internal with 32GB SD Card (like the HTC Rezound) drool (I know I am such a geek lol), Gingerbread or ICS Android, and the same excellent call quality and outstanding loud speakerphone.LG TAKE NOTE! The above specs would produce a sure-fire WINNER!

When I received a text message, I would use the touchscreen to click on the thread, instead of taking me to the correct thread, I would be directed to a completely different text thread that I could have no where near chosen.-The service is shotty, at best. I've sat next to someone with a different Verizon phone where they had full service and I had none.-The battery life, which is supposed to be decent, would die rather quickly to where I now have to have it plugged in whenever possible.-I have a 4gb micro SD card in this phone, where I keep most of the apps, which are two, my contacts, and all my pictures. Still it will tell me that my phone storage is full, but when I would go look at the phone storage capacity it would not even be half full.-The phone would flip out while I am using the qwerty keyboard to text, either the backspace button would stop working, or one of the single letters would multiply so my text would be full of 'ttttttttttttttt'. The only way it would stop is if I used the virtual keyboard on the touch screen or restart the entire phone.-Now the most recent issued I've had with this phone, is that now the screen is going through a discoloration phase for some reason. I can't even make out pictures when they are sent to me, now I'm out buying furniture for my new apartment, so I'm trying to send pictures of different pieces to my boyfriend, all the while I can't tell if the picture I'm sending is decent or not.-It continually says that my SD card has been unexpectedly removed, where it's completely secured in the slot.-When talking on the phone, it overheats and will drop the call and restart itself.Honestly, spend the extra money, get yourself a phone that works.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "No storage space!", "Author": "birdy88", "ReviewID": "R2FV1E3LNXFC0Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone worked great to start with. It is my 1st smartphone and touchscreen. Battery life is decent if you are in an area of great service otherwise I end up plugging in twice a day. I had the phone for 5 months before it started telling me there was no storage left and freezing if I didn't turn it off for an hour everyday. So I wiped my phone and started over everytime. I have now had the phone for approx. 10 to 11 months and it never has any storage space, it is constantly freezing, doesn't want to ring, doesn't receive notifications, has trouble with texting, all around doesn't want to work.Pros: great battery life considering. Great phone for the first several months.Cons: No storage space. Freezes all the time. Don't get it if you plan to use it for more then a year.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "This phone...", "Author": "Bree", "ReviewID": "RGGBOCAF9HLJ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Whoa! After reading a bunch of these reviews, I am quite shocked... I don't know what you guys do to your phones, but mine works amazing. I bought it on Craigslist for 50 dollars so i'm not sure what it's previous life was like save for a few scratches on the screen, but it works great. I will address some of the points made in other reviews.1. Battery life: It does die rather quick, but it's a smartphone. That's expected. It has all these apps running all the time. Mine used to last about a day then I downloaded a task killer and Juice Defender in the Android market and now I only charge every other day.2. Storage: most of the complaints are about internal storage and how \"most apps can't be stored in the SD card.\" This isn't the case with mine, I've stored all the apps I've downloaded in the SD card no problem. I have 15 Apps downloaded in my phone and it works very well with me. When it starts telling me that internal storage is full (and this is quite rare only happens perhaps twice a month) I don't need to delete my photos or texts. I go to manage my apps and clear the caches and the data to the apps. This ALWAYS makes that go away. It's usually the data on the browser that makes that pop out. Yes it does have a little bit of internal storage, but these are ways to get around that.3. Freezing: It hasn't froze on me yet (and hopefully won't) but the screen sometimes goes black like if it's on standby mode and it refuses to turn on.It doesn't do this too often so it doesn't phase me, I just pop out the battery and restart it and go about my day.4. Unmounting SD card by itself: Hah! does this to me very rarely! But it does happen. Who knows why... But It usually reads it all on it's own a few seconds after I find out what it's done. If not, I just pop out the SD card and pop it in again.5. Tapping a text thread and phone clicks different thread: Yeah, it does this too. Drives me a little crazy, but it also makes me laugh when I find out i've sent the wrong text message to someone i wasn't even texting in the first place. I guess my phone is humorous like that. However, I don't really encounter many problems clicking links in the browser or on apps. Just really likes pulling the bait and switch on my texts :)6. I read a review in which someone said that their phone was falling apart or something... umm... I have no idea what to say about that. Like I said, I purchased this used on Craigslist and all I have as evidence as to it's treatment in the hands of it's previous owner are some scratches to the screen and normal wear and tear. Uh, but my phone is not falling apart. It's very much intact and still in one piece. But I rarely drop it and I invest in cases and screen protectors for it so.. what are you guys doing to your phones?7. Lastly, someone said it was slow. Maybe I don't have to much experience with smartphones being this is the first one i've owned... but I have no trouble loading up youtube videos. Sometimes it can take a few moments to load up facebook or a browser page but it doesn't bother me. I guess i'm too patient... But what do you really expect from a smartphone from 2010? It's not a 4G LTE or any of the hot new stuff.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awful", "Author": "michelle", "ReviewID": "R1X4OK095RGWG0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Awful  Phone didn't work you couldn't hear out if the ear peace when I got it then it completely just stopped working  I I wasted my money!!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "guess u dont always get what u pay for", "Author": "Annette W.", "ReviewID": "R31MU2T55REWWB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was not hpy to see the charger port is all messed up so changing phone is hard to do that should have been listed its kinda important part of the phone", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Older Smartphone!!", "Author": "breann jones", "ReviewID": "RR1QGYTVQFI7B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well at first I was skeptical about this phone after reading reviews, but my screen on my HTC Thunderbolt had shattered and it cost more to repair as it would to buy a new phone. So i bought this LG Ally! It arrived EARLY! and it was BRAND NEW in the box, all stickers on it and everything. I seriously had it activated in less than 5 minutes, didn't even have to talk to a Verizon rep. Did all through automated system! The phone works great! The only thing I am not used to is it only being 3G. I am used to my Thunderbolt which is 4G so its a bit of a downgrade for me but aside from that its a great phone. As for all the people complaining about memory...if you put a SD card in it and store all your apps to that, you'll have no problem! SO my advice?

I got it because it had positive reviews from CNET and was the cheapest Smart Phone available at the verizon store I went to. I was particularly fond of the slide out keyboard (which I still think is great). It was the cheapest for a reason. Its just plain terrible. Here are the problems:1. Storage Space: This phone has terrible storage space. Yes, it comes with a micro SD card with 4 gigabytes, but what they do not tell you is most apps cannot be installed on the SD card, and even ones that can still require internal memory space. The phone has around 250 megabytes of space, most of which are taken up by the operating system and the pre installed apps you cannot remove (like myspace).  Anyone who wants a decent amount of apps should avoid this phone if at all possible. I am a news junkie and I have one news app on my phone because I do not have room for more.  Even Worse, if you are low on storage space, say goodbye to any incoming text messages. The phone will tell you the text message was rejected and even after clearing up the space you still won't get the text message.2. slow speed: the operating speed on this phone is very slow. most games do not work. the ones that do lag. further every once in a while the phone freezes. Best part, you cant turn it off because you need the touch screen to turn it off, so you need to remove the battery in order to restart the phone.3.  SD card: Other than the fact that many apps cannot be stored on the SD card, the phone often looses recognition of the SD card installed in it. Often times my apps installed on the SD card will not open because the phone does not recognize the SD card. Often the SD card is not registered as being in the phone.So basically, stay away from this phone. It is a piece of junk. You will be stuck with your phone for two years, so don't get cheap like I did, pay more for a decent phone. This one will drive you crazy and you will count the many months until you get your upgrade again and even contemplate buying another phone at full value just because you cannot stand this one!", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't Make The Same Mistake I Did", "Author": "J.

It will randomly turn itself off, randomly dismount the SD Card (that holds valuable information), the keyboard will randomly stop working which forces a removal of the battery to get it to work. The phone is very slow and unresponsive and does not hold the full capabilities of other Android devices.On top of all those wonderful things, it falls apart! Two pieces on the exterior have already fallen off, and the screen seems to be peeling off in certain places.All in all, DON'T GET THIS PHONE.

Constantly getting low memory warning when texting or if I happen to allow an app to update. VERY irritating.  As far as using it as a phone?  My home is in a great area for signal, but you can't tell it with this phone.

(I bought off of a friend that upgraded after having it about 4 months, I didn't want to lock into another 2 years when I still had 1 left.) Problem is that there is NO memory! I'm constantly having to clear stuff out, even with my sd card, there are way too many pre-installed apps that I don't use and can't remove, I'm constantly having to run a task manager to get it to speed up and then have to force stop everything it doesn't. My messaging will get full and I have to clear out and force stop apps to clear enough memory. I don't have a lot of apps that I've downloaded (maybe 6), simply not enough room for them.I love the camera, especially since I have a newborn, the pictures come out clear 90% of the time. People are always complaining that they can't hear me when I'm driving. It freezes up a lot and I have to remove the battery to fix it. Randomly shutsdown and restarts, browser force closes all of the time lately, I had to replace the battery which has a chip in it so alternate brands don't work and verizon doesn't carry them any more. I ordered one off of amazon for under $6. I use my phone as my primary source of internet so this made a BIG difference compared to past basic phones.Overall, this is a good starter android for a year or less or for someone who doesn't plan to have much on it. I'm glad my contract is about to be up though because verizon is just too expensive. I'm switching to a prepaid android $50/month versus $130 for complete unlimited, for 1 phone. Way too much to spend with a toddler and newborn to take care of.

I have had no problems with the functionality of the phone. I don't know if it's the Verizon service or the phone itself, but I have never dropped a call and I very rarely lose a signal. The touchscreen is not as responsive as I would like, but for a phone under $200, it's enough. If I really wanted something top of the line, I would have spent more on a phone.Now, for the biggest single complaint I have about this phone. There is very little internal storage. Every couple weeks I get a message that my memory is full. I delete all my text messages, which usually isn't many, call log, and application caches. This rarely gets it done. Generally I find myself having to remove apps completely in order to get the \"memory full\" icon to go away. I cannot keep the most updated Google Maps on my phone. That alone will about fill up the memory.I do have an 8GB SD card that I keep apps stored on, but very few apps I have downloaded actually go on the card. The phone (again, I don't know if this is an LG thing or a Verizon thing) comes preloaded with apps and programs that cannot be stored on the SD card and cannot be deleted. For example, MySpace. Yes, there is a MySpace app on my phone that I cannot delete. Aside from that I have City ID, Latitude, LG Social, Skype (does my phone run off of Skype?), and Visual Voicemail. All apps that came with my phone that I do not use and cannot delete.The battery life leaves some to be desired as well. If I accidentally leave my wireless turned on, my battery is drained by the end of the day. If I leave my GPS, bluetooth, and wireless on, there are times that my battery is low before lunch (along with extensive internet use, as well).Aside from the downloaded apps and battery life, I have had no other complaints with my Ally.

Nichols, careful shopper \"Love shopping on...", "ReviewID": "R3US1S5QKE8P4M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a Smartphone for my cellular service.  I found this one NEW on Amazon at an unbelievably low price, from JUST CELLULAR.  I checked other online services and none came anywhere near such a low price.I ordered the phone, and to my suprise I had it two days later even though I did not elect the extra expedited shipping option.  This was unbelieveable since it was shipped from California, and I live on the East coast!The ad for the phone on Amazon listed the item as 'new'.  When I received the phone, in the original box and was ready to activate it, I noticed that it had over 100 hours of use logged on the phone, even though the number had been removed and the phone was cleared for activation.  When I noticed this, I emailed the seller on the issue of it being listed as 'NEW' when it had usage logged on it.  I received an immediate reply back from them within the hour.  They explained to me that the phones were purchased in bulk from the manufacturer, as 'overstock', but some could have been on display, but had never been sold to anyone.  They offered me an instant refund of the purchase price PLUS the postage both ways if I wanted to return it (even though they have an 'exchange only' policy), or they would exchange it for another phone, and did have a new one in stock, that they would check to be sure it was indeed new.  They also sent a link to a site where I could compare cellular phones to each other to select another brand if I wanted to.  I elected the option of exchanging this phone for a like model that was new.  They immediately emailed me a prepaid shipping label to return the phone I had and said once I got it in the Post Office, they would ship out the replacement one, without waiting on the one I returned to get to them.  They did that and I recieved the phone two days later.The new phone was brand new and I immediately activated it and have had it for a couple of months and am extremely happy with this phone.  I didn't particularly want a Smartphone and had decided I would never pay the price for one.  I had chosen this phone in particular as it had a slide out full QWERTY keyboard that I was seeking. This phone was an Android one, and when I first activated it, it immediately downloaded the newest Android operating system.  I found that this phone did everything that the current ones on the market did and just as fast.  I became extremely interested in many of the apps available from the Android Market and learned all the features the phone had.  I have it loaded with apps that were either free or .99 at most.  I have downloaded everthing from different ringer tones, all types of games, an awesome grocery shoping list, an alarm clock that chimes on the hour during periods you set, etc.  I have a Bluetooth capable cordless home system and the phone is compatible with it and downloaded the complete directory into my home system.  I found OEM LG docking/charging cradle at Amazon for $3.95 that costs about $30 from Verizon.  It makes an excellent lighted alarm clock at night while the phone charges.I can't believe the low price of this phone for all the things it does, just as current ones on the market.  It has the full QWERTY slideout keyboard that is very easy to use.  It also has a virtual keyboard on the touchscreen that can be used either horizontally or vertically, and switches itself automatically depending on how you hold the phone.  I also found that it had speach to text which worked perfectly.  I don't need either keyboard, I just speak my text messages into the phone and who it is for, and the rest is handled automatically.  The new 'question' app available from the Android online market store free, works similar to the new IPhone 4S' \"Siri\", that you speak to and it responds.  You speak to it, it answers verbally any question you ask it, as well as carries out many functions such as adding an item to my calendar, or look up an address from my directory and will text or email them!  Awesome!I love the phone.  And, I'm extremely happy to find a company like the seller 'JUST CELLULAR' that was so eager to please me immediately to my satisfaction, with the exchange of the phones.  They even followed up with an email to assure that I received the phone and was happy with it.

Then they told me to send the phone back with my personal info still on the phone.

No. I ended up purchasing a new battery on my own. I cleaned the phone and returned it for a replacement. The replacement phone is a good phone.
