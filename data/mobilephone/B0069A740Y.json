My previous phone was a Palm, which I loved, but the screen cracked. I had to buy a GSM phone and found a $30 deal on the Pebble (not on Amazon). I have not yet placed a call, but hate every other element of it: manual is written by someone who does not speak English and does not have a logical mind -- you know, cannot follow a simple sequence like \"press button X in order to Y, then press button Z in order to ...\". I still cannot figure out how to lock/unlock the keyboard to avoid butt-dialing because there is no explanation in the manual and the onscreen instructions are nonsensical. The menus are non-intuitive or circular. Should it not be simple to tell if there is an unread text message, and then simple to read? Using the speaker phone should be one step so that it is simple to answer the phone on speaker, but no such luck.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can not hear what the other end saying", "Author": "Vivan", "ReviewID": "R1CD62459CCQ4V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Brought this phone 3 months ago, and it works great at the beginning.
