{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Its good..!!", "Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "RRYEY3IWP8ZVP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this phone as a back up (I live in a storm struck region) - The phone feels light and has a good form factor. - A full charge lasts for 2 days (provided u adjust the screen brightness and other battery requiring functions). - The music buttons on top of the phone are a bit annoying. There is no way to quickly see the time on the cover display. - It has customized charging ports which are also you headphone ports. So I bought additional headphones. The music sounds great. - The buttons are large and convenient. The shortcut keys may need customization. - Also had to buy a memory card. This is not a standard SD card but a proprietary M2 card which also means you will have to buy its adapter if you wish to transfer music form your computer.Final word: though it requires some additional accessories. I still like it as a basic phone. Works well, and the calls are clear and audible.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good receiver and range", "Author": "Randy D.

Bruen Jr.", "ReviewID": "R8UHCW35Q3PD8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a reasonably priced no frills basic cell phone. It works well for voice calls, photos, and text messaging. When used as a speaker phone it's okay. The phone's not much use for the internet, but the button for accessing the internet is so prominent that at first you may use it inadvertently, triggering unwanted data usage charges. A batterty charge can last several days.We got three of these phones (one black, two red) initially. They all performed well and lasted well beyond the life of the ATT contract. We went month to month thereafter since ATT had increased the price we'd have to pay under a new contract. Eventually one of the red phones broke due to hard treatment. We replaced it with another of the black phones for under $60 on Amazon. If we'd gone under contract again using the contract most similar to the terms we now have to get three new phones, the minimum cost to us would have been $240 additional over two years. (It'd also be a good purchase if you needed an inexpensive phone to bridge the gap from the time you lose a phone to the expiration of your contract when you can \"reup\" and get a glitzier phone as part of your contract.)A caution: The first replacement phone (red) we got through Amazon was inferior to the ones we had initially (poor sound; no pictures would come through on texts); no internet connection; when we worked unsuccessfully with ATT to correct these problems, ATT gave up and decided to provide warranty coverage instead. Then we (and the ATT rep) learned the warranty had expired. Though the phone had been advertised as new, it in fact was used, first activated on the ATT network almost two years earlier. We're guessing someone was dissatisfied with it and returned it under warranty (it still looked great) with its original packaging, and thereafter someone palmed it off as new. We returned it to Amazon and got another (black).", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inactive sim issue", "Author": "D G \"USA\"", "ReviewID": "RMMC1PNP07NIK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the red version for a relative and it worked fine with O2 Sim card, previous simple flip phone finally went bad considering that it was several years old.  Decided to get the grey version for myself as a backup phone liking its simplicity.1st issue like the first phone the random music playing, simply leave the lock slider on.  Also decided to erase any MP3 on my relatives phone lol, she did not need that.2nd issue - inactive Sim, appeared random but would constantly go inactive.  Searched the sony forum which I found similar issues claiming a bad Sim. Since I had the red version to test I was able to swap Sims and worked fine on red, but both Sims would not work on grey model.  An article on Sony site mentions the Sim cable may come loose and simply re-seating it would fix it.[...] getting the tools on amazon 6$ and followed it.15min to disassemble and back if you have the tools.  The connector is next to the Sim slot under a square foam, lift up and place back down.  Now it works fine. No missing Sim message.For now I am going to wait to see if the other issues listed here occur before changing my 3 rating. Freezing calls, battery life etc.So far so good. Bluetooth works with my wireless headset, as my alternative MP3 player to my main android phone.
