Not organized in any intuitive way.I wanted an unlocked phone so I wasn't stuck with an expensive data plan and use Pay as you Go with ATT instead.  I wanted to use the smart functions using the Wifi only, but I learned fast that there's random data service charges for various updates and alerts.  I highly recommend disabling data access over the mobile network right away.  You can always enable it when you really need it, e.g. in a pinch for directions while on the road.Overall, it's a good value with all the functionality of the high end smart phones, but it takes some getting used to.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dell Venue", "Author": "Fanny M", "ReviewID": "R2QQHG4ZM8S36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is a wonderful phone.

(This works, if you get the Venue made for AT&T.; The other choice is with T-Mobile). I've been using it for close to 3 years, and haven't had a single problem. The picture is sharp, I use Wi-Fi on it all the time, which saves me from needing a data plan (because I'm often nearby a wired computer, or can find a Wi-Fi hot spot easily, making the use of data *FREE*.)It holds all my music files and photos, and the screen size is great, and screen quality as well. Although I've yet to run out of space on the internal phone memory, you can upgrade to a 32GB memory card and NEVER run out of space. I've downloaded tons of free Android apps and they all work fine. I moved many to the SD card, so I'd have lots of space left on the phone itself, and also so I'd have an easy back-up of my photos and music files. I use Amazon's free Cloud service, upload my music, and then connect with the phone cable or wi-fi, and it downloads all my music to the phone. After 3 years, I have nothing to complain about, with one exception: Dell doesn't have much in terms of Android Tech support. This was frustrating in the beginning, but the phone is so intuitive and if you're familiar with Android, all the Android OS have the same look and feel, so I've figured out what I need to know on my own. (Plus the phone has an owner's manual built in, which you can access from the phone iteself.) By accident once, I hit the \"re-set\" and cleared all the data and settings off my phone. Once I logged on again and put my Google account in, all my programs and setting came back onto the phone. What a relief!While you won't see a lot of these phones around (as AT&T;, Dell, and T-Mobile were the only place you could get these) I'd buy it again, as I have nothing to complain about.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything I want!", "Author": "Happy Guy", "ReviewID": "R6O0PNJ750EE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone truly has everything I want: great camera, wonderful sound/speakers, crystal clear screen, and super fast.

Not when I received it.", "Author": "L", "ReviewID": "R18T8NYZ0M80GO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me preface this by saying this is mainly a review of the transaction and not the product itself. I give five stars to the phone and one star to the seller.The item I received was definitely not new though it was listed as such and the box has a label stating it is new. The package had been opened and the seal was torn and half missing. The package also had a deep razor cut that went all the way through the second box on the inside of the package. The protective film on the screen had multiple scratches. The packaging for the instructions, accessories and battery were also opened or missing. I can't be sure everything that is supposed to be included was there.Since the package was opened and was not sealed, the contents, including the phone itself, the battery, and all the accessories had spilled out inside the shipping container. All these items had been bouncing around loose inside the shipping container for who knows how long. Shipping was also supposed to be free, but that option was not shown at checkout. I had to contact Amazon about that and to their credit they corrected that. At the time I purchased this, it was a \"FULFILLMENT BY AMAZON\" item. A few days later it is not. I don't know if that is significant or means anything or not.Disregarding the issues with the transaction and shipping, the phone itself is nice-looking and has a quality feel to it. The 16GB MicroSD card that is included is a plus, and the price is not unreasonable for an unlocked phone of this type. I haven't tried it out much yet, but hopefully it works as good as it looks and feels.I'll update this review if problems arise due to the open package and less-than-new condition in which the phone was received if it results in having to return it to the seller, UnlockedCellPhoneKings.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased", "Author": "L.

This phone has one, HUGE flaw that everyone who installs any apps on it soon finds out: The 512 meg phone memory fills up quickly due to a system logfile that keeps building in size until the phone becomes useless. If you add up all the space occupied by the resident and installed apps, it does NOT equal 512 megs, but no matter - the phone bricks. We tried all the tricks, like moving whatever apps we could to the SD card, deleting data, installing apps directly to the SD card, etc. It just filled up again within a day, and then my daughter could not receive or answer texts. Instagrams also shut down from the memory problem. Dell's solution is to do a factory reset, which forces you to reinstall all your added apps. I'm going to try a hack fix using a root program, but this is NOT the right choice for a teen. RATS! It's a great-looking phone and the screen dominates the iPhone 4s. But as they say, \"If it's not an iPhone, it's NOT an iPhone.\" My daughter is happy now with her new 4s. This Dell is going on eBay.MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought this for my 15 year old daughter a few days ago, and she's glued to it. We surfed various big-screen unlocked GSM phones (AT&T; carrier) including four or five Samsung models in the $175-$250 price range on Amazon. She picked this one. To keep this simple, I'll use bullet summaries.PROS:  -  Huge, almost painfully bright and crisp AMOLED display. I can read it, including the Google Maps, without my reading glasses. And it's only set to about 40% full brightness.  -  Excellent web browsing experience. WiFi is very strong. Fast and responsive. Colors are super vibrant.  -  Very fast processor, for a 1.0 Ghz. Android probably helps that.  -  3rd party apps? Tons of them. It's Android, remember. I downloaded Instagram from my computer through my Google Account, and it installed it on her new phone right then and there via email. She was impressed, and it takes a lot to impress a 15-yr old girl.  -  Solid, with a quality fit and feel. The huge curved Gorilla Glass screen is a big plus.  -  Choice of regular or Swype texting. Some of her friends with fancy \"captive\" AT&T; phones don't have that.  -  Battery life is pretty good, she says. The indicator drops down to about an 80% indication right away, but then it stays there for a long time.  -  Excellent built-in apps for battery meter, percent usage of power by apps, and a dozen other useful pieces of info.  -  The Google maps GPS has great detail. The location icon is a little triangle that looks like the old icon from the Space Invaders game. It points north, and it rotates to maintain that as you do.  -  Uses generic plugs and ports, instead of proprietary. My Nokia micro-usb charger works fine with this. Uses a standard 3.5. headphone jack.  -  Excellent MP3 player. I didn't have time to play with equalizer settings (before my daughter snatched it away) but the default setting sounded great, with solid bass and low distortion. The built-in stereo speakers on the bottom are nice-sounding for cell phone speakers.  -  Has speak-to-text and other cool apps that work well, and have useful applications.CONS:  -  The GPS doesn't work well indoors or in a car if you are using satellites alone. By comparison, my Nokia N8  gets my location down in our club basement if I'm near the slider. Maybe once we buy a data plan it will improve.  -  Not as many accessories as Samsung or iPhone, but the Otterbox defender sold on Amazon works perfectly. You  don't need much more.So far, this has been impressive, and a steal at $190. My daughter's friends love it too, even those with iPhone 4s and the AT&T; Samsung smartphones. This is just enough different that it defies direct comparisons. I'll keep everyone posted.

The phone is brand new for an amazing price from Yellow Deals. The best part about buying the phone was dealing with Yellow Deals, they are professional and dedicated, amazing customer service. Once I contacted them about having to travel overseas earlier, they kept me fully informed about the logistics of shipping the phone, they even shipped overnight for me. They have a lady, Jessica in customer service, who is as good as it get in professional customer service.The phone, is great all around, not sure why Dell is not venturing full speed into this market. Only negative comment is that the camera is not the best in the dark, in good light it takes great pics, but without good lighting, not great. Still you're getting Galaxy SII & Infuse capabilities for less than half the price. The phone is chique and classy, got 2 of them.If you want a gsm unlocked phone, order this one worry-free!
