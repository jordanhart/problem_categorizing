I love the big digital clock on the front and the front speaker is very loud. The only problem is that I use it a lot and the battery drains pretty quick. I would order the extended battery with it if you use your phone a lot. Other than that this phone is simple AND indestructible!

I got this phone as a replacement for the pantech Jest 2 (which is an awful phone by the way, broke after 3 days) and I had 2 weeks to return it after i bought it in case something went wrong with the phone which iv'e already mentioned. By the time I received this replacement phone I only had 6 days to send back the pantech or risk being caught in a 2 year contract with a worthless phone. Upon receiving it the battery would not fit in and the Verizon store near my home informed me that they had sent an out of date battery with the phone. I read one more review where a woman complained of this same problem so it is clear that this is not just a one time mess up.

It survived lake swims, hot tub dunkings, the washing machine, getting run over in the mud, and several drops down a flight of stairs. I replaced it with the Boulder purely for the camera upgrade.Two things, there is no such thing as a new one of these phones.\"New\" means \"used with a sticker on it\". Since my previous experience with a g'zone phone was so good, I thought I'd take my chances with a used phone. The first one I had died after 45 hours when used outdoors during a light rain. Verizon said this voided their warranty, because even though the phone is specifically sold as \"milspec\" water resistant to immersion to a depth of one meter, Verizon does not warranty it as such, rendering that a point of blatant, unapologetic false advertising. I bought a second one figuring I would just treat it as a delicate, normal phone. It lasted a few months, then the charger port fell out.The actual charger port fell out. Like, it was just Elmer's glued in, and fell out still attached to the cord. Googling around, it seems that's a common problem with this model.I'm not a cheapskate, I would pay for a new phone that is as sturdy as my old type S. I don't want a smart phone, and I don't want to pay Verizon $200 for the new g'zone when its not warrantied for what it's advertised as?This phone is ok. It's marginally sturdier than the average clamshell phone, but be sure to keep it dry, and use the optional charging dock.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Casio G'zOne Boulder", "Author": "Curt Lange", "ReviewID": "R2GF97SD44PSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was everything they said it was.
