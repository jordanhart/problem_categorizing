{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For the price, well worth it - no contract to boot!", "Author": "Just Me", "ReviewID": "R3DTBOELYE6SNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm one of those that gets a new phone every 6-8 months. I'm not loaded with money or anything (I wish!) but I always get a good deal on my new phone and sell the old one to help pay for my new one. One phone I bought is the Nokia Lumia 710 for T-Mobile, which runs Windows Phone 7.5 which is a bit different than the usual Android or iOS. My current phone is the top of line bleeding edge Samsung Galaxy S III, but I still like the Lumia 710 a lot!All in all, I definitely recommend the Lumia 710 if you just want something different, want something simple, or are new to the smartphone world. Do keep in mind that Windows Phone 8 (this phone runs 7.5) is right around the corner and with it, all new Windows phones will come out. I'm just very pleased with the simplicity and smoothness of the Lumia 710 and Windows Phone 7.5. For the price, I don't think you can go wrong.I copied a bit from my Epinions review of the Lumia 710, but I will add some points specific to this item on Amazon. This is advertised as \"prepaid\" but you can simply put your postpaid monthly plan SIM in the phone and have a contract free upgrade. Note that this uses what's called a microSIM, which is half the size of a normal SIM card - it comes in the box, so you can call T-Mobile and switch over to this new microSIM for free.Some will say \"$200 for this entry level outdated piece of junk?\" -- where else are you going to find a decently loaded phone for $200 without a contract?? Don't forget that this is NO CONTRACT. Smartphones are expensive these days. T-Mobile sells this directly for $350 without a contract. Yes, Windows 8 and a new line of Lumia phones will be out soon but I'm happy with the 710 as-is. It text messages flawlessly, has a great 5MP camera w/ auto focus and flash, and is a 4G phone. Windows doesn't have as many apps as Android so don't get this if you are an app-a-holic. I'm not, so I'm fine. I just need Netflix, TuneIn streaming radio, Facebook, email etc -- all of which this Lumia does with ease.By the way, this is the perfect 'first smartphone' for young and older folks alike. Two of my younger relatives got the Lumia, as well as my middle aged mother and aunt. They are ALL enjoying their Lumias and wouldn't dream of going back to a plain phone! I've had a smartphone for years but only this year did I convince them into getting one, and the Lumia is perfect to start with.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best smartphone I've used", "Author": "anders123", "ReviewID": "R344BKA5UFJYMD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent phone.  It is well laid out and works well as both a phone and for smartphone features.  Voice quality is very good.  The manufacturer of this phone is making a comeback and look forward to their new Windows phone releases.  Windows marketplace is good and growing.  Reliable apps and certified so you aren't downloading potential malware.  I was going to wait for the Windows phone 8, but glad I got this one in the meantime.(Previous smartphones owned: blackberry and iphone 3G.  Prefer this phone to both of them.)", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good enough!", "Author": "Pascal Nerdier", "ReviewID": "R1ISC1517FUGZT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before the Nokia Lumia 710, I had iPhone 4 and iPhone 3G. I was getting tired of the iOS UI. Plus I was planning to switch to a prepaid account anyway. I could no longer justify the amount I was paying AT&T; for a smartphone I could barely use at work. While my iPhone 4 would work with T-mobile, the data speed would only be Edge which was not acceptable for me. So I started shopping around...The Windows Phone OS intrigued me because it was different from the mostly icon grid-based UI of both iOS and Android. The WP UI, I think, is intuitive. I was able to understand how it works pretty much from turning on the phone. If you have most of your accounts with Google (gmail, calendar, etc.) then setting up your phone is easy. However, since i did live in the iOS world for over 4 years, setting up my iCloud accounts was another story. I did manage to set it up but it took some time and research. The apps that came with it I mostly kept; others I deleted. I like that it came with a Nokia Drive app since I am directionally-challenged when I'm driving. Most of the apps that I had on my iPhone, I was able to replace with WP apps. But there are apps in iOS that I are not in the WP marketplace that I miss (like Tweetbot, Arclight, etc.). The app selection in the WP Marketplace also seems limited...The phone itself looks good! It's light (lighter than my iPhone 4) and it doesn't feel cheap. The screen size is just perfect for one-handed operation (it has 3.7\"  screen - I think anything beyond 4\" is hard to use with just one hand). The screen is not quite as good as the iPhone 4 but not by much. The camera, while also 5MP like my iPhone 4, seems inferior - it's harder to get a clear picture on the Lumia for some reason; it seems I have to really be steady to get a clear picture. I don't really miss not having a front-facing camera.Overall, it's a solid product. Had it for a month now and haven't had problems with it. Best of all, my monthly cellular bill has been cut by almost $50! And I can actually use my phone at work now!", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Pleasant Surprise for Windows!", "Author": "Write Away Bliss", "ReviewID": "R2JBU300GNIUD8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow the price on this really went up!  I paid $199 on Amazon for this phone (it's now listed for $299).  I previously owned an Android Phone (along with an ipod touch) so I'm familiar with the other platforms.  I've also had a blackberry and was so grateful when Android was released.I have to say I really LOVE the Windows platform on the phone.  Typically I hate Windows.  There's so much rebooting on a computer, error messages galore and just overall trouble.  To be quite blunt, I've had none of that with my Windows phone and there's so much integration that's better than Android.For example when I make a call, it's easy and the screen goes dark, no problem.  You want to hang up, all you do is move your phone away from you ear.  The movement lights it back up.  No pushing the power button to get it to light up.  No sliding your finger to end the call.  Just hit the button.  It's user intuitive and user friendly.  This is one of my big gripes with Android.  Hanging up a call can take a long time if your phone is finicky!  I also use Windows Live Mail all the time.  My calendar is therefore suddenly integrated into my phone!  I don't know why Android never made an app.  I know I could use Google calendar but again it's an extra step I don't need when my calendar is always with my email program.Nokia also offers Nokia Drive for free.  So if you're opting for Windows phone but deciding between the Nokia & HTC, if you have any intention of using GPS at all, get Nokia because it's FREE.  The phone is also super fast (faster than my previous Android).  It's 4G so the internet is fast as well.  So far it's had all the apps I previously used for free.  Amazon, eBay, Key Ring, Shazam.  It also offers SkyDrive so you can store some music, pictures, etc and access it anytime when you have a phone signal.I also love the Facebook integration.  I can pull up my Facebook photo galleries!  It's on the main page of my phone. I can integrate any email account (including gmail).  Adobe reader (pdfs) look great!  Reception is good.  You can use Ringtone Maker to create your own ringtone (you have to use a computer along with your phone).You will want to play with the settings because once you set up Facebook all your contacts are added and let's face it, some people on Facebook I really don't want to call or contact, they're \"old friends.\"  No problem!  You can turn off Facebook contacts in your phone book.I give it 5 stars!", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "What a great phone. Don't pay attention to haters.!!!!", "Author": "nomuyvivo", "ReviewID": "R1OD3Q8UIG3N8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was waiting at least 2 months since I bought this phone to give a fair and accurate review. Allow me to say first that I'm a heavy Apple user, with Imac, MacBook Pro and Ipad however since I'm a T-Mobile customer I didn't want to expend a crazy amount of money to use an Iphone 5 unlocked on 2G/EDGE slow network. This NOKIA Lumia 710 really is an amazing phone, well, the WindowsPhone OS also makes the handset a really great device. WPOS is very dynamic and highly customizable and the Windows Market Place is growing really fast if you are hooked on buying apps. Since I'm not an app junkie, the Market Place is irrelevant to me, maybe 5 or 6 apps I really care about and they are available.The screen resolution on this phone is amazing, almost comparable with retina display on IPHONES and as any other Nokia phone, the camera is above average compared with Apple, Samsung, HTC, Nokias always have had great cameras, I must highlight the video on 720p is outstanding with its image stabilization and sound enhancing. The Gorilla glass on the screen really makes scratches go by, great deal.One thing about screen resolution; VIDEOS LOOK AMAZING, any blockbuster and/or TV show look amazing on the small screen.Some haters might say the Nokia Lumia 710 has a \"plasticky\" feeling..well dahh..It is made out of plastic however I feel the telephone very well manufactured, no complaints there.The only 4 things about this phone I don't like:1-No upgradable memory, 8 GB which are really 6.3 GB, you have to keep a really close eye to all your content other wise you may run out of memory pretty fast.2-Battery life is poor, so if you don't want to run out of juice in a typical day, make sure you TURN OFF Blue Tooth when you don't need it.And ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS turn WI-FI off and keep your DATA ON at all the times. If you keep WIFI ON the battery, literally, will run in a few hours. LOCATION SERVICES don't seem to be a big battery consumer. Make sure your THEMES are dark and avoid really bright colors. Finally set the screen to 1 min max every single time is on.3-NOKIA went backwards with MAPS, they always had TEXT-TO-SPECH GPS prompts and now, all of a sudden NOKIA MAPS is only TURN-BY-TURN navigation, no streets names. You do can have that feature but you must buy a full GPS app from a third party developer.4-You need to be patient while texting or writing, keyboard, either on landscape or vertical is complicated if you have thick fingers.Other than these NEGATIVES, the Nokia Lumia 710 is really an amazing phone.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "So glad I bought it!", "Author": "busy gal \"tommy\"", "ReviewID": "R29PYO58I8CDTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One review that explained an unlocked prepaid phone could become a postpaid got me.

Casswell \"elizabeth074\"", "ReviewID": "R11OGU6RIS0VQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this phone for 1.5 years. I dropped it probably at least once a week on average. A few times those drops were substantial, like 10+ feet onto concrete! The screen remained in tact and the phone only had a few small dings even after all of that. After a year and a half the phone started to act strange (like putting people on hold and calling someone else while I was on the phone.)The camera takes great pictures, and the sound quality on calls is very good, and I also like the way this phone feels. It is small, but with a good sized screen, and feels good in my hand.Also, I just bought a new android phone that I am now thinking about returning, just because Windows Phone is better in some very key ways:The predictive text on WP is amazing. I was able to send texts and emails at the speed of lightning, and I never really knew why I was so much faster than everyone else (meaning everyone who has android), until I had my new android phone for a few hours. WP predictive text gives you a list of options, you pick one, or don't, and it goes with your choice. It knows that if you put a punctuation mark after the selected word that you did not want that extra space there. To go back to your original word after the correction, you just have to click on the word (which it automatically highlights) and select it from the ever-present list. There is no popups, no bouncing around text bubbles, just a line of ever-present word options. It does auto correct certain things (like cant --> can't) but most of it is easily in your control and at the touch of a button. Additionally, it seems to know what letters on the keyboard are close to each other and will automatically recommend words that were close (keyboard-wise). The android predictive text is a total fail in my opinion and such a waste of time! To me, since I spend most of the time on my phone typing, this is all kind of a big deal!Also, WP is super simple. I do not want to spend a lot of time making my phone do what I want it to. I want customization to be easy. There are not a million different ways to get to the same information depending on what screen you are in. The home screen has endless options that are easy to change. The settings are easy to find and easy to change.When I first got the phone, the main drawback was that there weren't many apps for windows phone, but that is not the case anymore.I think I am going back to windows!", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not a very good product", "Author": "Jan Nassif", "ReviewID": "REK1B2TMMCQTR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "returned it...quit working was not user friendly.....For something that is windowns based really thought it would be an easier product to use....wrong.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "i am enjoying it but", "Author": "ai chan1", "ReviewID": "R14TAXH1HQUN4U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well this is actually kinda my second Windows 7 Phone, the other was an HTC older model, but I only had it for 2 day .This Nokia is really pretty good.

I especially like the WIFI option for surfingwhen I am at home or work utilizing wifi networks and not my 4g plan.This is my first smart phone but for the past 2 years I have had an IPAD and the onlineexperience using Windows phone 7.5 has been every bit as enjoyable as the IPAD.The IPAD trumps in the realm of screen size but the windows OS is a joy to use andeasy to pick up on.My 2 complaints,  The camera button gives little feed back for focusing and theback button should give way to a good swipe on the screen more often then currently available.The phone feels good in the hand.I am considering buying my wife a windows 8 phone this year for her birthday.So yes I would buy this item again.Note:  I still ove this phone but I should mention when Microsoft rolled out there update to the Windows phone systemT-Mobile refused to allow there customers to receive the update.  There were some nice features in that update and I am now upset with T-Mobile as my carrier.  I'll still keep the phone for the next year but when I upgrade I'll change to a carrier that is looking out for there customers and works with the Phone manufacturer and Microsoft to provide a quality experience.

It is a nice phone, looks nice,however mine broke down after 3 months but Nokia phones have a one year warranty. I went to Nokia website, received a prepaid postage and mailed it to them, after two weeks I received my phone back working even better. So I was very happy about that. I have this phone now for about 6 months, I travel a lot and it is nice going to Europe buying there a SIM card and being able to use my phone, or I only re-charge my phone with money when I really need it, like when I am about to go on a vacation and I don't have to pay money to the cell phone company when I don't use it. This was the main reason why I got this phone, AT&T; always overcharged me (even with their lowest plan I ended up paying at least $65 a month on good days but it was so easy to go over text messaging and data that usually I ended up paying at least $80........now I only spend $30 plus $3 tax for 1500 combined minutes plus text messages) and as soon as my contract expired I decided to get a prepaid phone. What I also like about this phone is the windows map. I downloaded the state I live in to use it and even without data on your phone you can still use the GPS. How great is that! I only purchase the $30 dollar refill card as I mostly use my phone for talking and texting  but I like the GPS that does not need data to work (smart phone yes) you just have to pre-download the map you will need and it will take you anywhere. Before I thought I would have to pay/get the $50 dollar card to be able to use the GPS but no, it works even without it. I paid for this phone $200, not sure why it went up. I think that is too expensive right now. I know that apple sells prepaid phones and their iPhone 4 costs right now $450 and you can use it with t-mobile prepaid plan as well so if I were to purchase now I would go for more advance phone because anything above $200 is too expensive unless it is iPhone or Samsung galaxy. I will stick to my phone for probably another 1,5 years and see how the market will change. I hope there will be more prepaid/no contract phones out there.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "2 consecutive broken phones...

I wanted to upgrade to a smartphone and I selected the Lumia 710 based on other reviews.  Before purchasing on Amazon, I went to a nearby T-Mobile store to make sure that my old account could be upgraded to one with a data plan, that I could transfer my current phone number, and that my new phone would be set up correctly.  I then purchased the new phone on Amazon.  It arrived within a few days in a T-Mobile box and was obviously a T-Mobile phone.  I then returned to the T-Mobile store to set up the phone.  Whenever I made or received a call on the Lumia 710, however, the phone went completely black and I could not use any of the controls, all of which are on-screen.  The phone worked fine without any other problems otherwise.  After several trips to T-Mobile stores and numerous calls to T-Mobile customer service, the problem could not be identified or fixed by anyone at T-Mobile.  Several T-Mobile reps argued that the phone was not legitimate T-Mobile equipment because of the number on the SIM card.  I found this hard to believe because everything in the box had been new, unopened, and original.  I returned the phone to Amazon which refunded my purchase. I then purchased an Evo V directly through Virgin Mobile.  The service from Amazon was fine, but the personnel at T-Mobile were confused, poorly trained, and not helpful in keeping my business.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT VALUE and product...couldn't have asked for more for the price.", "Author": "J.
