I tried out the Note 3, the Sony Z Ultra, HTC One Max and the Nokia 1520 and each of them were great in one way or another, but ultimately it was very obvious that I favored the Mega 6.3 over them all AND it was the cheapest! No amount of money can buy a better phone, believe me I tried to top this and simply couldn't.I can't possibly explain how much I enjoy this phone. Hands down, this is the best phablet available.
