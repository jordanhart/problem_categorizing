{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Large Screen, ICS at an Affordable Price", "Author": "T. Benson", "ReviewID": "R1DWWP4PU9Z6OJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The ZTE Warp Sequent is very, very capable cell phone. I am coming from the Transform Ultra. I wanted to upgrade to a larger screen, so my review comes from the perspective of a person that uses his cell phone primarily to watch Netflix, Reddit, read the news etc. Though the Galaxy SII has the largest screen out of the Boost lineup, it is a full 170 bucks more expensive than the Sequent. I am on Boost because it is a cheap service. Buying a very expensive phone would kind of negate the entire reason I am on Boost. OK, enough of that. Here are the Pros and Cons as I see them.Pros: Very large, bright screen. Good pixel density, so movies and apps look great. Runs Ice Cream Sandwich. Not the latest incarnation (Jellybean) but still a massive leap over Gingerbread IMO. The phone isn't blazing fast, but it hasn't had a problem with most of the apps I use (again, Netflix, BBCnews, Reddit, Broken Sword, and Nova Launcher). The phone is thin, sleek, and has a very nice design.Cons: As others have said, the battery life leaves much to be desired. HOWEVER, I downloaded JuiceDefender (the basic is free on android marketplace) and that did wonders for my battery life. The phone is 1.4 GHz snapdragon processor. It is NOT a speed demon. If you use your phone for processor heavy apps, then maybe you should consider the Galaxy SII.Conclusion: A great, capable phone at a very good price. I'd be lying if I said it didn't have its faults, but at $200 it is still the best in terms of quality/price that boost has.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone", "Author": "airforce6394", "ReviewID": "R2KN85LN3I9I1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Honestly this phone is superb. Even though setting up for me but a lil bit difficult because i messed around and something went wrong. So i contacted tech support. They were super nice and resolved my problem in less than 5 minutes. The phone just need a remote setting refresh because as stated before after messing around with the settings i had barely any bars inside a building. But once tech support refreshed my phone remotely, i had incredible top notch reception. Camera is superb, nice call and speaker quality, nice sharp screen in my opinion, and fast data speed. For those who use the GPS \"android navigation\" you can actually hear the GPS notifications with windows down and wind blowing inside the car. That is deffinitely an A+ since i drive alot. How ever one thing for sure is the battery like all androids are not as great. In my results i can get about 9 hours of battery life before it reaches 25%. Thats alot of battery left, but in my opinion its the phone's way of saying \"you better find an outlet for me.\" So the bottom line is that this phone is worth the money.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great performance. Plenty of features. Iffy construction.", "Author": "Benjamin Fenster", "ReviewID": "R196NUW8B00820", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had the ZTE Warp Sequent through Boost Mobile for about five months. It's broken irreparably twice.The phone has generally performed very well. I've installed and run a variety of apps, all with very reasonable performance. There's plenty of storage for software and data, and the Warp Sequent has been very responsive. I don't stream a lot of video or run any computation-intensive apps, so I can't speak to high-end performance, but for everyday talking, texting, and surfing, the Warp Sequent gets the job done.Call quality and WiFi connectivity have both been very stable. The battery lasts about a day with an average amount of usage. I've never had to charge it except overnight.On the other hand, when the Warp Sequent fails, it fails spectacularly. Mine lasted only 34 days before it began shutting down constantly -- and I do mean \"constantly\". Even dialing half of a number on the newly-restarted phone was enough to make it restart again. I had to send the device back to ZTE for repair.Here, ZTE makes clear why this phone is cheaper than its competitors. Getting a replacement took about 2.5 weeks, end to end, including time for several phone and e-mail exchanges with ZTE. The customer must also pay the shipping cost to get the phone to their repair center (though ZTE pays for the return trip).That's a long time without a phone. Boost Mobile will send a loaner phone if you call to request one, but even that takes several days to arrive, and then it's the cheapest flip phone available.I've been entirely pleased with the Warp Sequent's performance, features, usability, and stability while it was working. But now that it's broken for a second time, I will be purchasing something from a different manufacturer to replace it.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "ZTE WARP SEQUENT SO FAR SOO GOOD!", "Author": "conni d", "ReviewID": "R3K6RYAE44E8Q5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "ok so i just received this phone this morning, i gave it four stars because when i first ran youtube on this it kind of buffered for awhile(havent activated it yet just running on my wifi) and the angry birds app was being unresponsive but after i turned it off an back on it was working well soo i was like uhh ok..? may just be because it was still starting up slowly or something but it seems to be a pretty good so far hopefully its nothing like its little brother the original warp lol.. the camera is very good in my opinion it doesnt lag or anything.. the ringtones are very loud..the youtube videos however are not :/ the con about this that ive noticed so far is the battery life so ill have to order a better one sometime in the near future but def. go with this if your looking for a new boost mobile phone. LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS :)  oh and also the screen quality is very nice and also the loading time in the google play store is very fast.OK IM UPDATING THIS REVIEW BECAUSE I HAVE HAD THIS PHONE FOR AWHILE NOW SO HERES SOME THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS PHONE...YOUTUBE VIDEOS TAKE AWHILE TOO LOAD AND THEY LAG AND SOMETIMES ARE OFF SYNC, IN OTHER WORDS THE VIDEO PLAYBACK ISNT THE GREATEST. I HAVE NOTICED IT LAG QUITE A BIT NOW BUT ITS BEARABLE.WHENEVER I MAKE VOICE CALLS THE CALLS DROP WITHING 20 SECONDS IM ON THE SECOND ONE ALREADY SO WITH ALL THIS BEING SAID IM SELLING THE PHONE, I PURCHASED THE GALAXY RUSH I KNOW I KNOW THE SCREEN IS ALOT SMALLER BUT I GOT IT ON SALE AT RADIOSHACK FOR 69.99 ON BLACK FRIDAY AND ITS WORKING PRETTY WELL. SO MY ADVICE IS LOOK INTO THE OTHER PHONES BEFORE DECIDING TO PICK THIS ONE UP BECAUSE IVE HAD TROUBLE WITH IT.MY RATING NOW AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS FOR THIS PHONE IS A SOLID 3. IF ALL YOU WANT IS A PHONE WITH A BIG SCREEN TO PLAY GAMES WELL THIS MAYBE THE PHONE FOR YOU..

FL.", "Author": "rtbabs", "ReviewID": "R1KQMO04B23G8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Boost customer for about 2 years and was paying $35 per month. Now with the Android phone I will be paying $40 a month for unlimited everything. Boost has been a great prepaid service. I have never had any issues with Boost service except when I went to the Outerbanks of North Carolina. I had no service. It was time to upgrade my phone and after considering the LG Marquee and the new Samsung Galaxy I went with the ZTE Warp Sequent and ordered it from Amazon the first day that it was availble from Boost. It is my first Android phone, and I am very happy with my purchase. I was able to get the phone up and running in less than 15 minutes by using Boost online. It took me an evening to get the phone figured out. I was able to find the complete manual online after doing an internet search so that helped with the set up as well. The screen quality is great. It is large and clear, better than my Ipod Touch. The phone is larger than an Iphone but thinner. The loading times are better than I expected but at times can be slow depending on my location. The sound quality is great too. It is easy to use. Yes, the battery life isn't that great. Now I get why my husband is always plugging in his Samsung Android but that is to be expected with phones that are mini computers. I solved that problem by purchasing a car charger and extra charger to keep at my job. Both items together cost about $5 here on Amazon. So far I only have to charge the Sequent once in the evening and turn the phone off at night. Overall, I think this is a great addition to Boost and a great Android phone.

Additionally, one day I found that the \"call reboost\" pre-programmed number was suddenly present in my contacts 100 times, literally. Moreover, I cannot even begin to count the number of times someone has called me and the phone never even rang or notified me of a missed call,  ever though my service was great.

I have read some reviews and everyone seems to like it.  But I must have either gotten a really broken one or everyone is delusional.  Here is why I say that.*  The 1.4ghz processor is really laggy.  It could not even handle Stumbleupon*  For reasons unknown it will not sign on to wifi that it should normally sign on to.  Even ignores your request to sign on.*  Facebook closes constantly (after I reset the phone the 2nd time)*  It used to let me save Apps to my SD, but not anymore.  It pretends it doesn't even understand what that means.*  Live Wallpapers make the lag even worse*  Screen locks up for no reason or when it has to load something*  Has no official contacts app, but uses Gmail*  Cannot send mass text messages (more than 2 people and it freezes)* Spotify does not work on this appNow I believe that some of the issues were because of a defective phone, but I also believe that ZTE is skimping on high quality parts and processors.  Even after I reset the phone, it actually got worse (and I learned that Google is selective about saving your contacts).  This phone has been a nightmare and I do not have the reciept.So be safe and do not take any chances.
