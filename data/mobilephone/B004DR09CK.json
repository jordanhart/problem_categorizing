All in all, I find it hard to do anymore than keep track of my emails and make calls. I'm spoiled. After having an IPhone, which is a Rolls Royce, this little beat up but waxed Chevy is such a dinasour. Interesting experiment but learn from my experience and don't buy it to begin with and waste your money.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "GREAT GIFT\nGREAT STOCKING STUFFER\nGREAT ITEM", "Name": "Blackberry RIM 8330 Curve PDA Cell Phone PINK For VERIZON Wireless", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416jZ7LUAdL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004DR09CK"}}
