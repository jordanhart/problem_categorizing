Here's a break down of my experience.Good things:1. Is a cell phone and psp combined.2. Is 4G so the internet is fast3. Sony's Android Skin is pretty good4. Has a strong speaker5. Battery life is pretty decent6. Strong antenna7. Good price point. Honestly for $200 unlocked this phone is not a bad deal for what you get.Not so good things:1. Cheap materials. Sony really went on the cheap when selecting materials for this phone.2. The screen scratches very easily. A testament to point 1. I've had the phone less than a month and already the screen has two large noticable scratches on the screen just from being in my pocket.3. Odd button placement. For example the 'back' button is on the far left unlock most android phones which has it on the right. Plus the buttons don't light up. Not too big of a deal but I expected something a bit more premium from Sony4. Games are expensive if you buy them from Sony. Better if you use an emulator and get them cheap or even free.5. Not all headphones work with the phone. You have to make sure to use headphones without their own volume control otherwise you'll get an 'accessory not supported' message.6. Doesn't accept 2G signal. Not a big deal if you're in the US but I live in Mexico and we don't have 3/4G everywhere. So when I went to visit a buddy of mine in a pueblo (small town) I had to use my old mexican cell phone.Conclusion: Not a bad phone for the price especially if you're into gaming. But I'd think twice before buying it again.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "buen vendedor", "Author": "galdor", "ReviewID": "R2V9TRVSA1Y06C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "nada de que quejarme buen vendedor serio y cumplio con el tiempo estipulado !lo recomiendo de echo comprare 3 o 4 equipos mas !!", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice cellphone but overprice", "Author": "Erik Posadas", "ReviewID": "R3W3000E3K8RXH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice cellphone but is a little overprice because we expect a smooth  performance and this own the internal hardware that is not the top notch, for that reason don't have the best performance.Thanks.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "Bhushan", "ReviewID": "R2UL2BEO89JQWV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its good...more than a month now....but no item key is at fault yet thou' i play a lotthnxBhushan", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": ":(", "Author": "Elery Jaen Arauz", "ReviewID": "R4HU6D3GQCLYF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Esp: Es un buen m\u00f3vil, para quienes son fanaticos al Play Station.Compre el tel\u00e9fono en el mes de septiembre, y en menos de 3 meses, la pantalla t\u00e1ctil se me ha da\u00f1ado, no encuentro repuesto en Panam\u00e1.Eng: It is a good phone for those who are fans the Play Station.Buy the phone in September, and in less than three months, the touch screen has damaged me, I find parts in Panama.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "excelente", "Author": "Carlos Eduardo Mauricio \"Ixbalanque\"", "ReviewID": "R2ORAFBVNQ198D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "muy buen tel\u00e9fono a un precio razonable, funciona muy bien el 3g en el salvador, muy buena calidad, lo recomiendo", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "excelente telefono para juegos", "Author": "Caremi garcia", "ReviewID": "R23PQDBQ1LF0BL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excelente telefono muy rapido y comodo para jugar, el android 2.3 gingerbread le va de maravilla y el 3g funciona muy bien", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "My Gamer Cell Phone 4 ever", "Author": "BIOHAZARD", "ReviewID": "R37R0NWHM6MY7S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent productI prefer this cell phone to anothers due the OS and the integrated gamepadThe battery life : (calls and normal use) +without data connection : 4-6 Dayswith data connection : 8-9 Hourswith data from wireless : 2-3 Daysbad things :its so slow to charge ...small internal spacevideoconference have bugs using gtalk", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect phone!!!", "Author": "A.

It is at the same league as the iphone.Things I like about the phone:1. Looks2. Touch screen response - very smooth.3. Display of the screen- one of the best.4. Camera 8 MP & HD video - Love it.5. Connect your phone to your PC & Sony updates your phone to the latest Android version.6. Android appsShortcomings:1. You will get a heart attack while opening the phone to insert battery. The back cover is a plastic cover and for a novoice, you will get a feeling if you are doing some mistake and will end up damaging your new phone.2. Battery life was never forte of Sony phones. With no data plan and occasional wi fi connections, the phone some how lasts for one day. Mind it is on a new battery,it will get degraded.3. Camera quality inside the house with the lights on is grainy and yellowish. You will have to explicitly turn off the flash. You cannot zoom the camera in 8 MP mode. If you are into taking photo zooming into photos, you will have to switch for lower resolution.Over all - Buy it, you wont regret.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great perfomance", "Author": "DLeon", "ReviewID": "RADIEBBC4ZTKD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think the only problem with SE's is it's limited capacity of internal storage, in any other aspects works just great.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "EXCELENTE", "Author": "diego linares  colombia", "ReviewID": "R3538ZXF53F4RY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UNA GRAN TEL\u00c9FONO CELULAR, ME FUNCIONO AQU\u00cd EN COLOMBIA Y NO HA PRESENTADO NINGUNA FALLA ES UN EXCELENTE CELULAR EN SUS JUEGOS", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Title of this product says UNLOCKED but it is NOT!!!!", "Author": "Gabriel", "ReviewID": "RSGOEDZNRG02L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Clearly the title of this product claims an UNLOCKED item, to my surprise and disappointment, it came TOTALLY BLOCKED!
