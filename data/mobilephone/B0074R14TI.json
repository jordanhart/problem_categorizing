{"Reviews": [{"Title": "DO NOT BUY FROM SIMPLE CELL LLC", "Author": "SonjaRae1989", "ReviewID": "R1Y1O4C82RX7E3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the iPhone 4s through Amazon to try and save money. I have tried to activate the phone through Sprint only to find that it is stolen. I am returning the phone today and if my money is not returned I will take legal action. Save the hassle and just don't buy from this company. Keep in mind this review is solely rated to the seller, NOT the iPhone 4s", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "\ufffd iPhone 4s is a great value \ufffd", "Author": "OregonBay \"\u00a9 OregonBay - 1999 to 2014\"", "ReviewID": "R37V2B2P92KU4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, the new iPhone 5 looks great, I bought the 4s since I live in a non-4G area and the screen size would have been the only real difference for me.  iPhone 4s at $99 seemed to make sense for me at least, as I was buying two (one for me, one for the wife) and we already have many devices that use the dock connector.  It just made sense for us, but may not make sense for everyone.The iPhone is a wonderful device, no matter which one of the current offerings you get, the 4 or 4s are still wonderful devices even if the 5 is already out.  I would have gotten the 5 if I lived in a 4G area and didn't have to worry about the extra money, but as it is...Anyway, I will try to outline the 4s as it relates to my experience so far.\ufffd UNBOXINGiPhone 4s is elegantly boxed as is expected for Apple products these days, unboxing is a big part of the overall experience and you will not want to discard any part of the packaging.  I have mine displayed on my glass top desk, beside my iMac and OS X Tiger, Leopard, and Aperture 3 boxes.  It makes a beautiful display piece and keepsake.  Everything is included in the box -- the iPhone, wall outlet adapter, USB to Dock connector cable, and ear pods (not the newer type for iPhone 5, but still stellar).\ufffd  SETUPSetup couldn't be easier, just select your locality, network, etc...  and you are up and running.  If you are like me and like to tweak your iCloud, iTunes Match, and other settings -- well, you know what to do.  Easy as Sunday morning.\ufffd  AESTHETICSThe iPhone 4s is a gorgeous phone, from its glass front, the metal band outlining it, to the glass back -- it's the best looking phone available today.  The screen has one of the highest pixel densities available on a smartphone, with the Retina display -- it's gorgeous!  And the shiny apple symbol and lettering on the back are so eye pleasing.\ufffd  BUILD QUALITYPerhaps no other phone on the market offers such a high build quality, and you can feel it when it is in your hand -- it just feels solid and well made.  That is no surprise as it is the best made phone available, bar none.\ufffd  FOOTPRINTThis phone is perfect in size for most hands, save for the largest hands out there.  It has been designed to be the right size for most of us and it shows, many of the other makers are putting huge screens on their phones, some have dubbed them as \"phablets\" and that is pretty much an accurate term for them -- too big for one hand operation, too small for a tablet.\ufffd  REAL WORLD USEOk, this phone is easy to use, and most of the apps you have purchased for your iPad (if you have one) will work with the iPhone 4s, and the standard apps work between your iMacs, Mac Minis, iPads and this phone.  This is a BIG deal for me as I keep shopping lists, passwords, business cards, recipes, and everything else you can imagine -- all in sync with the iPhone 4s.  If I update a password on one device I have the updated password on every device automatically via iCloud sync.  No interaction necessary other than entering it into one device.  This is a big, BIG deal as me and my wife draw off the same databases.  Having them all in sync means we never forget a password, account number, grocery item, etc...  We have had and do have Androids and could never get anything that even came close to iCloud sync on them.\ufffd  BATTERY POWERWell, when it comes to battery power on any of these smart phones the deal is -- they suck it down.  On average we get a days worth of power from a full charge.  It's pretty good for a smartphone, but no doubt will get better as battery technology gets better I'm sure.\ufffd  INTEGRATIONiPhone 4s, as stated above, just connects with all your devices.  iTunes, iCloud, iTunes Match all work flawlessly with the 4s.  Your iMacs/Mac Minis/Apple TV's/iPads will work with very little-to-no-interaction required on your part.  They just work.\ufffd  CAMERAThis camera takes a great picture for a phone, especially since the iOS 6 update -- now you can take panoramic shots with it!  The camera is one of the best available, even if the megapixels are not as high as some, the pictures are usually just as good, if not better.\ufffd  MUSICOne often overlooked feature of this phone is the fact that it is also an iPod touch.  With iTunes Match you have yourself quite the advanced music player which is easy to use and intuitive.  The ear buds that come with this have a control feature/mic feature on them, so you can put the phone in your pocket and control it from the ear buds -- nice touch.\ufffd  PHONEThe Antenna is somewhat weaker than my other Android phones, but I still get a crisp, clean signal from Sprint in my area.  Phone calls are easy, SIRI makes it even easier to make a call.\ufffd  APPSThere is no substitute for the Apple App store, there are SO MANY APPS available.  Pretty much anything you want to do -- there is an app for that.\ufffd  ACCESSORIESAgain there are just tons and tons of accessories for this phone, if someone hasn't made one yet someone probably will.  iPhone has more apps and accessories than any other phone hands down, from covers to all sorts of cool and useful stuff.CONCLUSIONWhile there is no way for any one reviewer to cover all of the things that make this phone great, I feel this phone is the best out there by far based on my use.  If you want a great phone which just works - get one of these iPhones.  There is no tweaking or rooting required to get everything you would ever want to do with this phone, just set it up and use it.  It's a work of art, a technological marvel, and a functional item all in one.OVERALLGet it!", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT", "Author": "Bella", "ReviewID": "R2HPD735FRR6QZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this gift for my Boyfriend and he LOVED IT!!!

However, what I will say that this is a true upgrade coming the Blackberry Torch 9850. I didn't upgrade because i wanted to, but because I had to. Im happy I ran into that obligation. my choice of phones was between the 4s or the 5. I wasn't eligible for an upgrade until mid June of next year I was force to buy a phone for the full price and surprisingly both the iPhone 4S and 5 were the same price (649.99+ tax). When I compared both phone, I didn't see any distinct feature(s) that the 5 had over the 4s (besides being faster and thinner) so I decided to buy the 4s from a third party (Amazon) saving me over $200. I must say I am very please with this phone.

This Apple iPhone 4S is my first, and I feel like I've rocketed to the future.WHAT I LIKEIt was a toss-up between the 4 and 4S. I'm so glad I picked 4S. I love Siri. She can dial my numbers for me. She knows who Mom, Dad, and husband are. I tell her to set my alarm and she does it. I let her remind me to do something when I leave and she never forgets. She is a wonderful friend. Voice recognition is not perfect, but it's pretty good for simple tasks.I especially love the camera. I take a photo and a copy goes straight to my PC. I don't have to think about it. I have a Pogoplug, and it sends photos straight to that, also.My calendar and email addresses also automatically sync. Wow. I didn't know that until I opened them up and found them all populated.WHAT COULD BE IMPROVEDI don't think typing on the screen is easy. While setting up my iPhone, I had lots of complicated passwords to enter. For that, I used a Motorola Bluetooth keyboard, which I highly recommend. For entering events and typing emails, I sometimes use the voice software and go back to correct errors.3G is very slow. I have to say, I'm already looking forward to my next phone two years from now, when it will likely be 4G. I'm making do with WI-Fi, which works wonderfully. On 3G, it's like having a dial-up connection.Still, I love my iPhone. I'm not going back. My phones will be smart forevermore.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is a great phone, but sprint would not unlock it.", "Author": "rabbit", "ReviewID": "R1824J58E3G8CP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought 4 of them week ago.

For >300, I would like to use it in a prepaid plan which cost much less money for a person who does not have lots of phone calls.

The pictures are so clear you will believe that something is wrong with your sight because the pictures are clearer than your vision.The sound on the phone is louder than any other phone.The internet connection is by far faster than any other phone.And the screen is glass so it isn't likely to break but if it does every mall in America repairs cracked IPhone screens on the spot.The camera lens isn't protruding like with other phones, it is hidden so it will not be damaged if you drop the phone.Only bad thing is you have to pay for music.I love my IPhone and I will never go back to Android....ever ever ever", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "4s Apple IPhone 16G Sprint", "Author": "Miranda", "ReviewID": "R206YNOCVNQNME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good condition, but still waiting to get it unlocked.

I called Sprint and was told that although data roaming on iPhones may be turned off, it still uses data roaming and that you have to turn ALL roaming off. Seriously?! We live in the woods and I need my phone. The problem isn't with too much voice roaming, just data, but I can't use voice, either?! Nonsense! This is a problem between Sprint and Apple, not me.

ABContacts is wayyyy better than the native iPhone address book (only $3)3. The notes app on the iPhone won't let you insert images so get NoteMaster (it's only $5)4. Skype (so you can use less minutes & buy a cheaper Sprint plan)5. Amazon app (of course)6. eBay app (ditto)7. Gas Buddy (for finding the cheapest gas near you)8. Zillow (for finding the cheapest homes near you)9 Plenty of Fish app (for finding that special someone - the app is free but she probably won't be)10. CamScanner (the free version for scanning documents)That's just to name a few I find most useful.Overall; this is a great phone; just get one!!!(You should also throw away that old Windows brick & get a MacBook Pro too..)", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "QUESTION", "Author": "hecmorpc", "ReviewID": "R3GKQN1B0XSX8L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hi, I am interested in the article but I need to know if it is factory unlocked? because I want to use with an operator in Venezuela ...", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blergh", "Author": "Ashley Wilkinson", "ReviewID": "R1BDKMBOHWRP1K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This product works fine, I just really prefer androids.

I am very excited that I can fire Sprint in three short months.Ten months ago I bought an iPad mini from Verizon. I carry both devices. I frequently get messages on the iPad ten minutes before the iPhone. Sprint's data service is so spotty, even text messages and voice mail are delayed. It can often be longer, but a ten minute delay is typical (visual voice mail and Apple messaging).I can never rely on having a solid data connection. When traveling in rural areas, data is impossible to find. In many of the same areas, I get strong 4G or 3G on the Verizon iPad. Owning both devices clearly illustrates how inept the Sprint network really is. Even in a metro with 500,000 people, I frequently am forced to find a wifi hot spot in order to use the web to get data or files for my work if I don't carry the iPad.Sprint is weak in cities, and useless in rural areas and small towns. I travel frequently for business and I regret my Sprint purchase daily. Unlimited data is not a value if you cannot access it.The 4S is a good device. If you are considering the 4S, I definitely don't recommend it on Sprint. I would trade my iPhone on Sprint in a heartbeat for the klunkiest phone n Verizon because the phone is crippled by the Sprint network. If you are considering the 4S on a different network, I highly recommend spending a bit more for a 4G device. 4G networks are ten times faster, even on reliable networks. A positive smartphone experience is dependent on good data service.In 2013, the 4S is beyond obsolete because of the 3G data service. A 3G-data iPhone 4S on Sprint is so crippled that I would only recommend it if the person has constant wifi access. If you do have constant wifi access, an iPod touch is all you need.
