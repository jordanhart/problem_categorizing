The price is unbeatable. The phone looks and feels like a plastic toy, but reliability is good. Reception, SMS, sound quality - nothing to complain about.

The charge lasted 18-24 hours and that was standby time.  I figured I got a bad battery so I returned it to the store where I bought it and exchanged it for the same phone.  This charge only lasted 8 hours on standby before the phone was dead.  I am returning this phone and will be trying something different.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cheapness throughout", "Author": "TimTime", "ReviewID": "R1L3KWTGLZKWAM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yuck. I like flip phones but this one is really bad. Was looking to replace my LG Flare which was a great flip phone but showing it's age. I got this home an played with it a little and the buttons and phone just feel cheap. Screen is really small and bad resolution for the text. To top that off the ringer volume is a whisper, half the volume of my LG. Took it back to the store before I even activated it. There are better phones out there so pass this one by.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kyocera 2100 Camera Flip Phone", "Author": "Rose Miller", "ReviewID": "R1HP95RYJJCAP5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm so happy with my Kyocera 2100 Camera flip phone.

I always liked the clam-shell design, because I dislike pocket-dialing. The only downside to its design is the little rubber button that sits in a hole on the left side, which tells the phone that it is closed when the plastic peg from the half with the screen presses on it. The problem is that the button is made of rubber, and with time it developed a neat, round depression - so the phone no longer recognizes that it is in closed position, but acts as though it is always open.The reason for the 2 stars rating, though, comes not from its physical flaws (like I say, there is one to mention, but a very minor one). The real turn-off is the operating system. It feels like a badly coded JAVA os, and the time span between press of button and result can stretch for seconds. Many times I start punching a number in - only to notice that a few seconds later, the phone catches up and starts showing numbers from the middle of the input process. So I have to erase number by number, just to start over from the correct place.The amount of lag is mind-boggling. Every single function you can access takes an eternity to wait for, and if you like to work fast, the phone throws a tantrum and makes you start over. If speed and sharp response time are important factors for you, don't get this phone.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent inexpensive phone (but not for $50!!!!)", "Author": "WayneBob", "ReviewID": "R35WORU9RITGOH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "$50 for this from Amazon's 3rd party vendor?!?!? Are you guys high? It's $19.95 or less at common big-box stores here. The camera is lousy, but I like the button feel. Displays are small. Texting is a hassle, but no worse than any other non-keyboard (12 key) phone. I only use it for emergencies, so the cheap price and pre-paid service work for me.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kyocera S2100 Camera Phone", "Author": "Foxman56", "ReviewID": "R46313443SNNF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone not knowing if I'd like it.

Vandewalle \"Lucky Budgie\"", "ReviewID": "R38FF3M14FVGGH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I liked the look and feel of this phone.  The large buttons made it easy to dial, even in low light conditions.  User interface was fairly intuitive, but screen resolution could have been better.  Text font and point size are not adjustable.  For 30 bucks, this phone is adequate for basic communications.  However, reception of Virgin Mobile's service in my area (Rochester, NY) is less than fair to practically non-existent.  I could not reliably depend on this phone to connect at any given time - which defeats the purpose of having a cell phone.  No contract for Virgin Mobile service made it an easy decision to toss this phone in the trash.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "user manual & camera", "Author": "ed", "ReviewID": "R35II0WYC07YPW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "whats the matter they can`t afford to give a user manual with this phone!!!!!!!!! how am i supposed to learn how to use this phone?plus the camera doesn`t work !!!! virgin wireless wants me to pay to use the camera. i guess richard branson needs the money!!", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "my new phone", "Author": "mark", "ReviewID": "R12Q3JVE4UMZAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi my name is robert i have tmobile mytouch 4g phone its a ok phone but i just got a virginmobile flip i love it battery nice the phone works perfect i love virgin yall the best for people who looking for a virgin mobile buy from amazon.com u wont regret it thank u guys", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "check with service provider on service compatability\ncontact us for more info on the phone if needed.", "Name": "Virgin Mobile PayLo Kyocera S2100 Camera Flip Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PVsDg4BnL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004RQYM3E"}}
