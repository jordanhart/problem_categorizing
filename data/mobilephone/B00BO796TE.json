This company is selling defective products. The camera is awful, games do not work, lots of app fail, and ultimately it ends up not working within an hour of arrival. This is the worst $100 you could ever spend. I highly suggest finding a different generic S3 such as that sold by VMInnovations or buy a real version of a phone such as an LG or Samsung. They sell Nokia windows phones for $99, Way better buy then this hunk of broken technology (If you'd even call it technology.)
