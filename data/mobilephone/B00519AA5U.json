{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Phone", "Author": "JELT", "ReviewID": "R36ATN8X6C3C4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent, excellent phone!!Everything has worked just beautifully.  Easy to operate and configure (run into a little trouble with HSPA settings, but it turned out to be more a problem with some service provider settings than something wrong with the phone).Sound quality, as usual with SE phones, excellent.  As far as sound goes it is better then IPhone4 and waaaay better than any BB.Configuring DLNA with my PS3 and Bravia TV was really easy and works beatifully.Tons of apps available through Android Market.Swaps between HSPA and WIFI instantly when it connects to WIFI.Camera works well even in bad lighting conditions.Only downside found so far is that battery life is a little short (a day and a half in average)  but its something that you sort of expect with this kind of phone (I had similar battery life with an IPhone 4 and a BB).  I found a longer lasting battery that fits the phone on ebay.  Still waiting for it to arrive.  (I will update the review once I evaluate it)Quick shipping, well packed.Overall great service experience both from Amazon and JR.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best low-tier high end Android phone on the market", "Author": "SINnWo", "ReviewID": "R1WSP9YPW1FZYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone isn't your dual core powerhouse, but it is without a doubt the best low-tier high end Android phone on the market.  It's got everything you need (WiFi, Bluetooth, DLNA build in, Front facing video camera, fast processor, plenty of ram - 512mb, and a perfect size screen for multimedia viewing/games/browsing.  Not to mention, this phone has style and isn't the traditional large screened black brick.  It fits comfortably in the hand with it's unique curvature and it easy to operate with one hand (you can reach each corner of the screen with ease).  The phone ships with Android 2.3.3 (gingerbread) with an upgrade available now to 2.3.4 (gingerbread) and Sony Ericsson has confirmed that Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) will be hitting all of their 2011 phones (including this one).  So it's future-proof for the immediate future.  It's also not loaded with a bunch of bloatware and can have the boot loader unlocked with ease.  All in all it's a great phone, fully featured, light on price!  I have enjoyed it so far!", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "MT15a Xperia Neo", "Author": "sonyzreal", "ReviewID": "R1I1WEUGEM0H8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been enjoying this phone since I got it.

O, and it arrived in one piece, how I like my new online purchases :D.Easy to sync with my carrier and transfer my previous data and contacts to this baby.Phone is fast in processing with only the one 1Ghz and has a dynamic screen for viewing videos and sliding away at your pictures. Camera is also well above average and much more powerful in mega pics than most smartphones.If your looking into getting an amazing piece of technology, consider it, trust me. It will make your daily life a whole lot easier. Apple is great too but for half the price you can get everything the iphone does, maybe even, in my opinion, a few other things much better.Enjoy. Hope this helps.power to the shoppers!", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "the product is good the seller doesnt give the hd cable", "Author": "victor montiel", "ReviewID": "R140NEJXVOQQH7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "is good the cell but it doesnt came in a original box and they dont gave you the hd cable it sucks!!", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone, but why is it set up for South America, and sold in the USA?", "Author": "Brett Paul Bellmore", "ReviewID": "R2100K3LUDZR0Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone itself I like a great deal. Basically everything I was expecting, I've had a good experience before with Sony Ericsson products. Looks good, nice tactile feedback on the buttons. (Stiff enough you're not likely to actuate them by mistake.) Fantastic display and camera, and good sound quality. Haven't had a chance to test reception yet.Just slipped in the sim card from my old phone, and it worked fine. Though I did have to import the contacts one at a time off the card, which made no sense.Downsides:It arrived, in the USA, preset for Portuguese, and with a bunch of pre-loaded South American telecom apps I can't get rid of short of rooting it., which I'm looking into doing.Removing the back to install a sim card or memory card requires applying enough force to make one nervous about causing damage. I suppose that's better than my last phone, which had the back fall off on a regular basis.No manual accompanied it, just a generic \"How to start your Android phone\" pamphlet, which wasn't even accurate, I suppose because it had already been started.The charger has a plug assembly for insertion into the wall which is absurdly bulky. Why is it I can get a tiny one at the gas station, and the phone comes with one that sticks out 3 inches from the wall?", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVED IT THEN AND STILL LOVE NOW!!!", "Author": "Oscar Otaiza", "ReviewID": "R25Y9UH704K04C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone 2 years ago and still being one of my best purchase ever!

But If you are a hardcore user (tons of apps) then look something else, because you will notice the lagging after a while (I am a hardcore user and it is getting pretty slow after 6 months of use. I have a lot of apps).My only complaint would be that it is a little bulky and battery life is short (around 6-7 hours, normal use, low brightness).Why the five stars? because for the price, the phone is beautiful, doesnt feel cheap and it performs well as long as you use it only for the basics.
