{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works Beautifully", "Author": "J. Phan", "ReviewID": "R1T1SJHM5F2A5B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ever since my Blackberry Curve 8900 has been dead, I've been researching phones all over the internet. My criteria were the following: decent camera (>3MP), LED flash, Android 2.2 or 2.3, touchscreen, fast processor, good battery, and under 250 US dollars. After a week of researching (and being phone-less), I settled on the LG Optimus One P500 (even though it didn't have the LED flash I was hoping for).My first concern when I found this phone on Amazon was whether or not this phone would work with my T-Mobile SIM card, since the title says international version, but didn't say unlocked. I was also concerned about the lack of reviews (at the time, there were only three other reviews). After some hesitation, I placed an order with The OEM Shop.A week later, I received my phone and my first impressions were quite good. After inserting my SIM card and powering up the phone, I discovered that my T-Mobile service worked (not 100% sure if it'll work with AT&T; though). After setting up and playing around for a good hour, I have a few things to say about this phone.Pros:- Fast processor; much faster than my old Blackberry- Android OS 2.2 is amazing. Haven't figured out how to upgrade to 2.3 yet, but that's supposed to be available for this phone too.- Touchscreen is responsive and accurate- Allows up to 32 GB on a micro SD card- speakerphone is great- sturdy construction and very pleasing to the eye- Extremely easy setup with your Google account- Bluetooth exchange is fast (I don't use a headset. I just tested bluetooth by sending a file from my computer)- The phone was shipped with a screen protector already applied. (I wished I knew this earlier before buying a pack of screen protectors along with the phone)Cons:- very small internal memory (170MB). I use a moderate amount of apps (I have about 20 apps installed on the internal memory with about 40MB left and 25 apps installed on the SD card). If you're a heavy app user, don't get this phone. Some apps can't be transferred to the SD card, but with some research, I think there's a way to get around this.- A little on the heavy side.- Camera quality isn't too great. Pictures are better than other cameras in its price range, but they were still not too clear.Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase. Though there are some things that bother me, I think this phone suits me very well for the price I paid.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "The perfect \"get me into Android\" phone", "Author": "mongrelion", "ReviewID": "R6KEGUMPMP1WJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are wondering which phone you should get in order to get yourself into the Android world, you should consider to adquire one of these. Definitely one of the best phones out there.It is completely Custom ROM Compliant. I currently have Android Gingerbread (2.3.7) with CyanogenMod 7.1.0, with a lots of applications, overclocking and stuff. It's just awesome. I can't stop playing with this phone.As I told you, to start in the Android world, I think this is what you may be looking for.The arrival took 1 week but it was in perfect conditions (actual new), inside its original box and with all the accessories listed in the description.The battery duration is not that good. I've been testing it and using low brightness, 3G connection, data sync and chatting all day long, it can survive for at least 8 hours. But I've been told that this is the weak spot of Android Phones.The speaker sounds really loud, the screen sensitiveness is good and the weight is acceptable.I don't know what else to say but I am really, really happy with this gadget.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Impressive Android Smartphone", "Author": "Kerrie Lee", "ReviewID": "R5JKQADCNTI9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE:I am very pleased with the performance and functionality of the Optimus. If you're an Android fan and don't need the whistles and bells of an I-Phone, this is a good choice for an unlocked smartphone. For my needs, I wanted a phone that could connect with my wi-fi at home and work without paying for a data plan.I'm impressed with its look and performance. I have had good luck with the LG brand and the Optimus is a step-up from my previous phone.The only criticism I have is how slow it is to load videos, such as YouTube.PROS:- It's a good size (large enough screen) and weight (not too heavy)- Beautiful resolution- Very easy to operate, intuitive design- Wi-fi is a huge plus because I did not want to pay for a data plan. I can access the internet at home and work, using wi-fi.- Good LG website with step-by-step instructions: [...]- Although item description does not specifically say it is an unlocked phone, happily, it is. I put in a Go Phone SIM card first, disabled the phone's mobile data access in settings, then replaced it with my previous phone's SIM card.- Will accept up to 32gb Micro SD card, which is what I am using- Comes loaded with a good variety of Google and other common apps: FM Radio, GMail, ThinkFree Office, Voice Search, Facebook, music player, calculator, calendar- Because it's Android, it's easy to add apps from the online Market- Nice responsive touch screen, once you get the feel for its sensitivity- Great sound, plenty of volume- Battery life seems good; mine needed complete charging upon arrival (about 2-3 hours)- Texting (Messaging) is easy- Camera is decent; it's not the quality of an IPhone, but it's not the price of one either- Comes with a simple manual that pretty much covers everything you initially need to know.- The price is right. I shopped around and this phone has nice features for the cost. I'm pleased and feel that I got a good value.CONS:- The micro SD card is not easily accessed; you have to remove the back plate to get to it, which is even a bigger pain if you have a snap-on case- Phone is extremely slow to load high-quality video; it's fine for your average YouTube fare, just not the HQ ones. Maybe if you have consistent 3G or 4G service, this wouldn't be a problem.- Phone charger came with a plug for European outlets, no adapter (fortunately the chargers from my previous LG phone worked fine)- Included micro SD card has limited storage (only 2GB) and most of that is already loaded with phone and PC applications. I copied the files to my computer's hard drive and then transferred them to a 32gb microdisc, which works fine in the phone- The LG PC Suite (software to connect your phone and computer) was not easily found on the LG website- The earphones that come with the phone aren't much to brag about and are hard to keep in your ears because the buds are so big", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the right price", "Author": "Mr.Anony", "ReviewID": "R2YBYNMHWETW6R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I ordered this phone it was about a 160-170, which was a sweet price for this phone. This phone is my first android phone, I love it, its not perfect, but it does get the job done.It comes with froyo 2.2.2, comes with 2gb and adapter, screen protector is already applied. so no need to purchase a second oneMy major negative about this phone was that the keypad for texting is too small, in vertical or horizontal mode. Listen, I don't have big hands, so when my txts come in as \"so.mmmmmmwww\" instead of \"some\" it can be frustrating at times.My gf has an android as well, and her keyboard is well spaced out. Her Phone is a little bit bigger, but still..LG could have added a few cm to the thingThere are unlimited possibilities to this phone. You can root it and overclock it, and even update it to froyo2.3(must be knowledge about hacks and rooting of course)Its only a 600mhz processor, but if you overclock it, you can get it to at least 800mhzBattery lasts a long time. I've tried it with 2g on all day, it drains a little faster, Wifi is a drainer, so if you're not using it, please turn it off. According to the settings, Wifi takes 4% of battery power. That's doesn't seem alot, but when you're browsing and playing with your phone+the 4% your batt will die quicker. This goes the same with 2g, if you're not using it, I suggest you turn it off.Without any internet networks connected, it lasted about if I had to guestimate, ballpark a day and a half.I recommend buying the otterbox LG optimus commuter case, and buying it from amazon. Despite otterbox's claim saying it does not fit this model(optimus 1 is optimus T in america) it fits like a beaut! And its cheaper on here than the otterbox site.

Good phone.Good phone for folks who just want to get on the web without breaking the bank.Some learning curve such as learning to disable all application sync & auto-connection to further extend battery life, never install battery draining apps such as wikitude, and installing a free screen lock app.Android 2.3 upgrade coming in May. It will be even better.General side gripe: Unfortunately there are no charging case accessories in the market for almost all other brands except iphones.

Phone was advertised as Condition: new by Amazon.  This phone was previously sent and returned by another buyer in Melborne Australia, repackaged and sold as new.

Under Select language & locale there is no English (United States) but onlyEnglish (United Kingdom).3. After downloading various applications from icon Market, all the icons that were created on Downloads menu disappeared after restarting the cell phone. Possibly the reason this phone was returned from Melborne?Update: After contacting HassleFreeCell.com customer service they agreed to pay postage to return this cell phone. I am pleased with their prompt service regarding this matter.Update 2: After being assured that all their phones were new and not repackaged, I ordered a replacement from HasselFreeCell.com thru Amazon.

Living in asia, I had a problem connecting to the android market- spent hours on forums doing everything to get it to work. What good is an android phone without the market?

Perhaps google fixed this asian issue with an upgrade.The positive:The seller (Hasslefreecell)speedily shipped the phone, brand new, with Gingerbread installed!The screen resolution is good and it does connect to wifi.Negative:Camera and video recording are not very good.
