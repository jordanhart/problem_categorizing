I Reported the event to Amazon by email and the call center. After some days the supplier said that was covered under a limited warranty that did not cover the phone for a matter of time. He also received the backing of Amazon in this matter by sending documents with small print with some details of the warranty. Then i conctacted  Nokia USA because Amazon recomended it,  as this is the country  where i bought the phone . Nokia USA verified that the code IMEI was not of phones sold in the U.S. and therefore is out of warranty , can you believe this? . Place a claim on this issue on Amazon. This means that the equipment be legitimately acquired through Amazon was a scam and none of the companies like Amazon and PVCS gave me and effective response to solve the problem. You must to considerate that i  bought a high-standart cell phone, expensive and now is useless . The phone does not have 15 days of use and no more than 40 days it was purchased brand new.For this reason my rating is negative  and i dont recommend this company to purchase equipments and in the case of Amazon 's, the policy of protect their customers against this type of situations it affects the credibility of the company.regards", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Windows Phone as of early 2013", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R12E3U5OP29TB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree, is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "No lo recomiendo para usuarios de movistar", "Author": "Luis Leopardi", "ReviewID": "ROAJTD53THDLC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Lamentablemente este telfono de AT&T; aunque desbloqueado, NO PUEDES seleccionar el tipo de banda en la quieres que trabaje, es decir movistar venezuela es 3.5 G, en otros lumia 920 tu puedes seleccionar la banda entre 2G, 3G y alta velocidad o 4G, sin embargo en este terminal esa opcion no existe quedando solo para 4G, por este motivo el terminal no trabaja con la red de datos de movistar, asi que No Lo COMPRES, esto es una estafa.Unfortunately this phone from AT & T but unlocked, you CAN NOT select the type of band you want it to work, that is movistar Venezuela is 3.5 G, in other lumia 920 you can select the band between 2G, 3G and high speed or 4G yet in this terminal that option does not exist leaving only for 4G, which is why the terminal does not work with the data network movistar, so do not buy it, this is a scam.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone in overall, but poor battery life", "Author": "Carlos Tiburcio", "ReviewID": "RI79ODAFMXITJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've being using this phone for over a month, and I can say is a great device, really solid build, great camera, and lots of good features, no doubt Nokia still knows how to make good phones despite their current situation. Only complain I have is battery life, I have to charge it daily, since apps like whatsapp and connecting to wifi really consumes pretty fast the battery, so a charge only lasts around 1 day and 2 hours, but or course, seems to be the tendency of smartphones now to have shorter battery life due to all apps , social network apps , etc that need connectivity all the time, I hope this improves in the future with new battery technologies.In overall, recommended phone, but make sure to carry your car and/or outlet charging cable with you as well.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "bought 2", "Author": "Ali", "ReviewID": "R3REVLLA4F4G7N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "His and Hers, we love them.

The Nokia phone has become her own merits in the most desired by users of the platform, which makes the Lumia 920 so unique from the competition?For starters, its spectacular display PureMotion IPS technology, which ensures a much higher response rate than that of its rivals, plus a high brightness even under sunlight and an incredible touch sensitivity. Its density of pixels falls below the HTC 8X, but instead offers a slightly larger screen coming up to 4.5 inches. On the performance side, processor and RAM shared with rivals, and stays at an intermediate point on the capacity of the battery, below the Samsung ATIV S.But if there is another feature that is special about the Lumia 920 is its main camera. Beyond its 8.7 megapixel, the largest of the three phones compared, which has led to more comments PureView technology is used by Nokia that offers quality in the photographs as had never before seen on a mobile. His system allows high quality photos in low light conditions and image stabilizer, polemics aside, substance ensures improved video recording from the competition.The dimensions of Nokia smartphone loses out, being the thickest of the three little heavy and quite unlike most of its 6.53 oz. In return we have a more compact look great all the design \"unibody\" inaugurated with Nokia N9. Care adds details, such as wireless charging sold separately.HTC 8XThe headliner HTC is all a sample of expertise and stand out very well against its rivals, with several points in which the lead.The screen is not one of the sections which emerged victorious. The HTC 8X offers the smallest screen of the three devices with its 4.3 inches, but it does maintain a great resolution of 1280x720 which give it the highest density of pixels from the comparison. Its Super LCD technology maybe stay a little behind the rest but offers more than enough quality. In their guts have the same processor dual-core Snapdragon S4 of ATIV S and 1GB of RAM, although in this case with less battery of three in competition. Storage also remains somewhat behind, with 16GB internal and lack of microSD card slot.Paragraph photographic eye, because, without hogging all attention wing that has taken the Lumia 920 in this issue, the 8X offers an 8-megapixel camera more than satisfactory, equipped with technology similar to what HTC has offered in its latest Android devices . And to complete the multimedia section, nothing better than to take their work with Beats Audio for great sound provide the terminal. Not to mention LTE and NFC connectivity it shares with its other two rivals.Despite seeming to be left behind by its smaller battery, less internal storage and lack of microSD slot, the explanation is found faster when we take a look at its small size. The 8X is the smallest of the three high-end WP8, but still thicker than the ATIV S, leaving its weight in a mere 4.59 oz. To this we attach a very attractive design that has received very good reviews from those who have had their hands in appearance and comfort.SAMSUNG ATIV SProbably the most enigmatic of high-end phones with Windows Phone 8. Samsung is superior in several sections.The ATIV S boasts the largest screen size with 4.8 inches they leave behind its competitors. Also, this comes with HD Super AMOLED technology so successful that the company has made on other devices. Instead maintains the same resolution 1280x720, leaving a lower pixel density than its rivals, although still at very high levels. Again we have a dual-core processor at 1.5 GHz and the same 1 GB of RAM, although in this case is supported by a battery of 2300 mAh, significantly better than their opponents. As for storage, the Samsung is the most flexible, allowing internal choose a size 16 or 32 GB and appending its possible expansion with microSD cards.The camera is perhaps where worst comes stopped ATIV S compared to the other two competitors in the high range. While maintaining the type with its 8 megapixel, lack of promotion by Samsung of the same rule we can think of as technological added special in this case advertise their rivals. The rest of the features is on par with its rivals, including the maximum connectivity LTE and NFC.That if, as a work of engineering the Samsung smartphone stands out from the rest thanks to its spectacular screen size in the body content thinnest of the three, with just 0.34 in. thick. To that we can add their meager 4.76 oz, almost on par with the HTC 8X, and you have a real beast of a body very content. Surely its design is the least attractive of the three, but that can be a strength that will help convince users who prefer a more sober style on their phones.I hope to help you in your decision with this modest analysis.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia Lumia 920 or any Windows 8 Phone is a bad choice for business users!", "Author": "plumbing-parts-guy", "ReviewID": "R1BWK8MEJSV0O4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Nokia Lumia 920 Windows 8 phone is a frustration for you at first, if you have been used to working with a Windows desktop or laptop.  In my case I have used to working with a Windows 7 laptop. As a Windows user for years thru many versions, one thing that has always been consistent, is how you could logically store your files under folders with sub-folders, not with this Windows 8 phone.  DO NOT copy your folders over to this phone or it will never find it. Copy only the file document you want over to the Documents folder on the phone.  This has solved my dilemma for opening DOC, XLS, and PDF files, however the same procedure did not resolve my problem with OneNote files.  So I still need to find a solution for it.  This means you will not be able to store your files in an orderly manner as you may have been used with other windows devices.  This means means that 32 GB is way over-kill for phone memory if you are going to use the phone as a compact computer for business purposes and not wanting to carry around a bunch of music and games.  Who wants to have a lot of work documents on their phone without being able structurally store it. I just stumbled upon this fix for these documents by experimentation. When you Google for a fix to being able to find your documents on this phone, there are a lot of people having this same problem with no answers on the fix.I hope this has been helpful.My only hope is that Microsoft decides to make this phone more functional for a serious business user and provide an app to resolve this problem.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$549.99", "Features": "Unlocked for any GSM (will not work with Sprint, Nextel, Verizon)\nWindows 8 OS\nPureMotion HD+ touch screen\n32GB internal memory", "Name": "Nokia Lumia 920 Unlocked - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gi6juwUqL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AGPWSNQ"}}
