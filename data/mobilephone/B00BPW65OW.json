The choice was this phone or the Galaxy S2, I'm glad I went with this phone.For one its LTE where the S2 is still on WiMax, also it is faster and has better graphics processing than the S2.I never had 4g with my Evo because it's running on WiMax still, same with the S2. Now I have 4g pretty much everywhere running on LTE.I have had the phone 2 days now and have nothing bad to say about it, the Beats boost even comes on when I sync it via bluetooth to my radio in my car for Pandora.If you buy this phone you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow Amazing Phone", "Author": "Raymond gomez", "ReviewID": "R26MMM02I3NTO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I came from sprint , I owned the HTC evo , evo 3d and I recently sold my Samsung s2 just to get this phone . A lot of people are complaining about the lte shut up and get over it I live in an area where I only have 3g I don't care.Screen resolution is so amazing I don't know why some people complain it looks the same as my Samsung s2. The camera is so amazing crystal clear pictures and doesn't make that annoying loud noise most phones do so if phone is in silent mode and you want to sneak a picture of somebody you can lol.and I can take up to 30 pictures instantly by holding the shutter button.Call quality , again people complaining I can hear everyone perfect and everyone can hear me perfect also . Speed , dual core processor so you can multitask and run heavy games.Sound . When headphones are plugged in it eneters In beats audio mode which is amazing sounds so clearI loved my galaxy s2 untill I came across this phone im gonna keep this phone for a long time definitely worth the 299$.", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "HTC ONE SV on Boost with 4G LTE at $40 a month is a great DEAL!", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "RA7SGHYYM4Q43", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well the HTC One SV on Boost Mobile is a decent phone.Mobile hotspot cannot be accessed with this phone.However I live in the Chicago area, and I always get 4g LTE on the phone, I tested with speed test.net app.Here is the rating I got, 17 mbps data download speed! WOW!The lowest speed for download I received was 8 mbps.Call that slow, and you're crazy.My friend tested her iphone 4s on AT&T; and her 3G speed was .89 mbps average.This phone is reasonably priced at $299, if that is too much for you I should suggest you look into the Kyocera Hydro currently priced @ $59.00 on Amazon.comIf you are into GSM phones look into the google play store for their unlocked phones like the nexus 4.However this phone has decent battery life, decent screen quality. Even though the specs seem like this phone would nothave a decent screen,it does have a very usable screen.I came from a Samsung Galaxy S3 FLASHED to Boost Mobile, where I was only receiving 3G data speeds, to this phone.The GS3 is an amazing phone, if flashed it's data speeds are slow. I do not feel like I'm missing too much from the changing of my phones.I feel like I gained something special in return, 4G LTE, that is a killer feature of this phone on Boost Mobile.Call quality is the same, no dropped calls mms is great text is not delayed, everything else is great.Trust me the phone is the best Boost mobile has to offer currently. If you are not on Boost, you can buy a better phone, but you will pay more altogether.Check the sprint website before you buy enter your zipcode to see if the sprint towers in you area offer 4G LTE data.Good luck.[...]", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE!!", "Author": "Katy", "ReviewID": "R3OJ9SJMDBJV7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone thanks you so much.

About the only thing that's been more difficult to use compared to my old GS2 is finding how to fully turn off AutoCorrect.+ Strong GPU has made for a measurable upgrade in Android games ran on the phone, as well as overall better text and video quality.+ HTC software and built-in apps are handy, and genuinely add to what the phone can doThe downside, is primarily the battery life. On its stock 4.0 kernel out of the box, the battery barely lasts 4.5 hours before the low battery warning comes on. HTC's released 4.1.2 update for the phone adds an additional battery-saver assist that brings it up to 8~9 hours a charge... Still nowhere near the 17 hours that Boost Mobile advertises for the phone. Depressingly, neither HTC nor any third parties have released an extended extended battery for this otherwise handsome device, even though there's no reason there shouldn't be one for it. Given all the strengths, it's really head-shakingly awful that there can't be more done about the battery. There is much to like about this phone, that a more substantial battery would have easily made it a five-star purchase.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Had it for a day...", "Author": "Rock Chalk Mama", "ReviewID": "R3VO4H9QTPQSLX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "...and it already kicks my old phone out of the water.

I have never had any problem with Cricket for the last 15 yrs or more.  I went from a Samsung Razor to this HTC One SV. Big change! My monthly bill is only $55 and I get unlimited everything but storage.My phone didn't come with an instruction book but I found one on line. Best to go to [...] where you can learn much more. I registered on the HTC web site and also called there tech support for some info on Micro SD cards.  The tech I spoke to was very informative and customer friendly, even told me a few things I didn't ask about and did appreciate. 7 days a week closes 6pm ESTMicro SD for this phone max is 32gb, tech said class 2 or 4 will work and they didn't have any further info if there were any problems with any of the other class cards.The \"Beats Audio\" only works with head phones and can be turned on and off in the notifications area.  Sounds great, my phone has a slight problem with the ear speaker distorting on me.  I have insurance through Cricket but offered only a replacement of a re-manufactured phone, asked HTC they said theyd send it to TX for repair if still under 1yr warranty.  I will hold out for that option as I can live with the occasional distortion.Great App I added was the Norton anti virus for androids.  [...] Its a good idea and has came in handy already.  Tech support helped me by chat and works great.Phone has a reset feature if you goof or get lost like I did.  Just remember to do the update again.Very nice phone!

I came from the older version of the same phone and this one passes the other one by leaps and bounds. I know only time will tell but so far I could not be happier with the phone or with Amazon. I upgraded to this phone because of problems with the other phone and it was still under warrenty. Amazon was more than easy to deal with they were great. They took a bad situation and turned it into a great one and i must say they get my highest rating as a retailer that stands behind thier word. After several e-mails and a phone call to customer service explaining my problems and the reason for the several e-mails was my fault for not being clear enough the problem was solved and BOOM the next day my brand new phone was on my door step. Let this be an example to all those retailers out there complaining about lagging sales if they treated thier customers the way I was treated by Amazon then they would not have a word to say. I love the phone and the upgraded fetures from the older version and the over all design is way more than I expected. Like I said only time will tell but right now you could not give me a $1000 iphone 5s to trade for this one. Hands down to Boost after 7 years of $ 200 and $300 dollar a month bills from U.S. Cellurlar you cant beat Boost. I have great service and never a problem and the payment just keeps going down and down. Your a fool to go out here and sign a 2 year contract with some other company just becauce they are going to give you a $1000 phone for $99 bucks dont think they won't get their money back in the long run and if you don't get your phone from Amazon your a fool also. They have stood behind their word and thier products and could not get a higher rating from me. Thank you Amazon and thank you Boost !!!!!!", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone and Service", "Author": "Terry Maines \"TM\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZP59V3S0ILVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect phone for my wife. She is not a power user but runs some apps and things. She likes the screen (I didn't tell her that it is one of the knocks on the phone) and really appreciates how fast it reacts. We are in a pretty much 3G only area, but it browses well. Boost is actually pretty cool. For about $60 month it is all inclusive. And the bill is the same every month(until you hit longevity discounts). No sneaky carrier charges, besides a couple bucks for taxes. She most likes the form factor of the phone, light weight and looks. There are plenty of specs given by other reviewers. If your needs are met by a good working and somewhat robust phone, with great ergonomics and stylish looks, this is the real deal. One last thing. Not being locked in a plan is great. The $230 upfront is a small price to pay and you are above water in about 6 months. Don't get the insurance. As with all carriers, the deductable is $100. So it nets you a 130 savings if you need to replace or fix. And who knows, by then there may be something better out there.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "wonderful", "Author": "Greg Whaley", "ReviewID": "R11PDEE6L7YGTS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is without a doubt the best cell phone I've ever owned.

It was also on Boost, so this is how I will compare the new HTC phone.  First off, we have 4g in Atlanta and I notice the phone operates on 4g almost everywhere I am, so I am very happy about that.  The web experience is superior to the old 3g phone.  This phone is very quick and will load pages nice & quick.  I refused to even use my old phone for web access because I didn't want to wait 2-3 minutes for a page to load.If I had to mention some negatives I guess they would be the following:  a) no hotspot capability (but I knew that in advance, so I can't ding it in the review for that);  b) It would be nice if the earpiece volume and speaker phone volume could each have a higher maximum volume available, but both are still acceptable.My favorite feature of this phone is that the battery really lasts a long time.  I still charge nightly, but when I get home from work in the evening the batter is still about 3/4 charged.  I use it mostly for talking, texting, and checking email as well as some light web surfing.  I leave 4g and wifi on all the time too and yet it still doesn't seem to affect battery life much.  Overall an excellent phone, no freezes or quirks noticed and I would recommend to others.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone is amazing To Be Honest", "Author": "Juan Lugo", "ReviewID": "R243FCOG6HILZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First things first let's start by saying don't listen to those bad reviews. No LTE poor signal blah blah blah. Yes if you live in those small towns that gets a movie a month after its released then yes don't get this phone. LTE is most likely not available in your area but to be sure just check the Boost Mobile website to verify. If you live in the city like Miami, Orlando, Hollywood, L.A., NYC etc, then yes this is a good phone for you LTE is almost everywhere not inside my class but that's cause my college is made to withhold hurricane winds and yes its hard to get LTE in there other than that its perfect signal my family has Metro and they don't compare to the signal strength.I went deep into Ocala FL and I had 1 bar inside middle of nowhere, family lost signal as soon as we left the interstate. Shows you how great it is and just to say signal and LTE may very by location. This phone Is amazing I love it slick and easy design beats audio is perfect Works only with headphones speakers are not supported my beats audio.Voice control works and gets it right the first time.I love the color the phone but the only thing I wish it came with a SD, I had to order my own.

a long slim crack between the screen and case on the left edge. It is so significant that I can see light leaks out of it, making the circuit underneath vulnerable to sand and dust.Sent it to HTC for repair, gotten it back after three weeks and the problem remains. If you don't mind poor craftsmanship and would like to try your luck, then get this.P.S.

I suggest this phone to whoever is looking to buy it. It is much smoother than most android phones. Android can be pretty choppy when changing screens, but this phone is almost as smooth as an iPhone. I like it, the battery last a long while if you use it correctly, I even use a live wallpaper and at the end of the day I still have about 50% battery life left. In order to get that long of life out of the battery i have to do a few things. Turn off WiFi, turn off Data when i am not using it, turn off GPS and put it on power save mode, I can text and call day and still have life at the end of the day.

The HTC One SV offers the same 4g LTE speed as those models at a lower price. And, the HTC is a better fit for smaller hands and tight jeans pockets.The HTC takes adequate photos outdoors and fair photos indoors. The rear speaker is adequate but music sounds much better with good headphones.Battery life depends on how you use your phone. If you turn OFF locations and disable \"Google Now\" and keep 3g, wi-fi, gps and bluetooth turned off except when needed you can get up to 24 hours on each battery charge.Go to the Boost Mobile website and study the coverage map for your home and neighborhood before you buy a Boost phone.

Just in a few seconds the download is down. The 4g and 3g are really fast and work well. The beats audio is just WOW! The music difference is so well I can not believe this phone is on Boost at times. The battery life is really great on heavy usage I get about 7 hours before I need the charger. The camera is really good the zoom is a little foggy but still comes out really well. HTC has stepped up with this phone. I hope Boost release 4.2.2 with sense 5 to us and hopefully we'll get 4.4 kit kat. This phone is just wonderful.

I had the Samsung Galaxy S2 and I accidentally dropped it.  Luckily I purchased insurance from Best Buy for only $40 for a year. While the S2 was a good phone,  the HTC One SV is far better!  It comes with 4G lte and is blazing fast. It comes standard with a full functioning GPS free.Another feature I enjoy is it has a call favorites screen. All your contacts can be connected to Facebook. You don't need to log on to Facebook to know their status or their comments,  everything is published per contact on your phone.It comes standard with a FM radio,  the phone is a perfect size, fits comfortable in your hand, it's made solid and comes with a front facing camera and a rear HD camera and video.Another plus is the battery life,  roughly 16-19 hours and when it's practically out of juice, recharging this phone is super quick.I was reluctant at first to trade in my service from Verizon to go to Boost. I am so happy I did. I pay with Boost $55 per month unlimited and I am on their shrinkage plan.  Every 6 months you pay on time your monthly fee drops $5, eventually you will be paying $35 for unlimited super fast coverage ($35 is the lowest the plan goes)  Oh and Btw the $55 you do pay is exact, no extra hidden feesYou do have to pay full for the phone, but it is so worth the trade of paying standard $110 per month.

M \"M M\"", "ReviewID": "R23NRW1KJZQ6TT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is on Boost in Chicago. Now the first review reads like an ad from Boost, don'tcha think? Boost, Sprint and US Cellular are soon to merge, so that might help. I've had US cellular since before they were Primeco. There's a reason for that; the damn thing works in my house. I've had the same phone for 9 years. It needs to WORK above all else. It needs to sound good, first, store music well, and move and take pix without needing a degree in comouter science.I do NOT see 300.00 here. Boost can be cheap all they want, but if it's a very expensive doorstop in my house, what good is it? No one would even get me an ethernet to hook it up to a booster or what they call a \"repeater.\" This boosts your signal on internet or antenna so u don't always get dumped while you're uploading. I use verizon with an Amped 5,000 ft reach Wireless repeater. THAT was worth 75.00. It has a 85-90% work rate with the repeater. Much less without.  The US cell phone works almost anywhere in my house, including basement and bath to some extent. What if you had a medical injury and couldn't get a damn signal? It may cost 140 a month to stay out of contract, but cheap is no good if it don't work.  The picture-moving is a real pain. I have a few I took w it that WILL NOT move to Twitter, after being moved to the laptop. NONE of my old files I took with my ancient Olympus have this stupid problem.I plug that old sucker in, get an icon asking if I want to upload them to PC, click yes and the Wizard does it all with nothing more out of me. They WORK. They are high-resolution, btw.  It's alright as a phone, I guess. You don't need high-res for that. That's why God made Bose QC 15 noise cancelling headphones. The internet takes forever, and more often times out. I miss the tiny signal icons that you could switch bluetooth ad signal pickups from on main screen.  As a camera, you get the best pic in the BEST possible light, not too birhgt, not too dark. How often do you have that? I am with Stanley Kubrick on the issue of flash. ABSOLUTELY NOT! EVER! Use a real light.I see no difference with \"low light\" setting, It just looks grainy. You get sharp pics if the light is perfect, as I said. But if they're VERY hard to move, what good's it??I don't see a total of 500.00 with insurance, service, headphones, and tax. I'm not going to pay for it for 18  months, either. I;m sending it back. I need to be REAL impressed for five bills.  I was much more impressed with the 6G Ipod Mini+HP someone gave me free. It was easy to use, once I told it we're a later version than itunes thinks. It kees a charge nice, was cheap (free's cheap) and it has a nice feel. Capacity's impressive. Wish you could charge as you use it, and add over just erase the whole thing. I do forget to lock functions, and you can go deaf that way.  As I said, forget this one, or at least send it back when you confirm what I already said. From Best buy you get thrity days with no return fee. I don't play with return fees (ie, AT&T;).
