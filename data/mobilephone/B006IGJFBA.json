The frame is surrounded bu buttons you'll be touching that activates functions you don't want to use while simply dialing or plugging the unit in t it's charger. When dialing a number it automatically locks after sending the number so you have to push several buttons to get a keyboard back to push an extension number. The screen is not visible in daylight and disconnections are constant. The disconnections are not AT & T - other phones I have do not have the perpetual disconnection problem. Unless you want to find yourself shooting up a post office within a week, avoid this hardware at all costs.

I actually tried a different model first, which made me realize how much I like this model! It's easy to navigate and one of the best features (IMO) is the slide-out keyboard. It's not too small to use, which is one issue I've had w/ other basic phones. If your needs for a phone are just talking and texting, this phone should work well for you.

Every phone I looked at had some flaws that made it undesirable. From reading the other reviews, this phone actually exceeded my expectations, although there are a few minor flaws that I can deal with.Mostly, this phone just took a little getting used to. At first I had difficulty sliding out the keypad, which was very frusterating. Over time, the slide-out keypad became \"worn in\" and now it's a breeze. The keyboard itself is great. The touchscreen is not great. The thing that bugs me most: There are three panels to organize your \"widgets,\" which is nice, but they easily become scrambled and sometimes disappear. I cannot keep my screen organized. Perhaps I need to wait longer before putting my phone in my pocket, but who wants to do that?Otherwise, it's exactly what I was looking for: A phone that also works as an MP3 player.
