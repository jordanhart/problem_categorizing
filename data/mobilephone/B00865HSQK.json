{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A solid phone with good call quality and long battery life", "Author": "John Robinson \"two stroke cycle dude\"", "ReviewID": "R3O8G3FNIF0YG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this phone a lot! Good battery life, good in call audio quality, and a usable feature set. The slide out key board is very good and easy to see, makes sending text messages a snap. Screen size and quality are very good.Too many phones have either a nice loud ringer and a not so loud ear speaker, this has both - very nice.Camera and video quality are pretty good overall, very usable either way. And with 32GB of add on memory capability,you can pretty much save and store as much as you want of anything. DURABLE !!! this phone came out of my pocket at 70 mph on my bike and lived with NO loss of function at all. Granted, i had a full coverage case which took almost all the abuse of the fall. But hey,that says a lot about the build quality. Sure,some denting of the plastic case and the slide out hinge is slightly bent - but still works 100 percent. Good tough phone.Yes it has internet, but...a little costly in minutes to really use a lot. A little slow, but it will work in a pinch if you need it to get information or do some emergency banking etc.On the tracfone plan it's hard to beat triple minutes. If you live on the phone, pay as you go may not be for you. It will add up over time. But it may still be slightly cheaper than a monthly plan, but not by too much.Overall i give it a ten out of ten. Get a protective screen film, the hard multi piece case, and a fully protective leather case and it's almost bullet proof.You could do an awful lot worse for a phone. You will not be sorry you bought this one - and you'll have it for a good long while too.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Glad I got this!", "Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "R1K2S9RBCQVAWJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Terrific phone. I was really sick of an LG tracfone that never took calls well. You always wondered when it would drop calls. Ugh..hated it.This, however, is a nice little phone. All my calls go through, the messaging is a snap, LOVE the slide out keyboard.Add triple minutes, you got a good deal! Don't hesitate!Wanted to add: I love the voice command feature. Hit the voice button, and say, \"Call Mary\" and the phone does it. Wonderful feature....really handy and it works really well.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "It WORKS!", "Author": "Louis C. Pusch", "ReviewID": "R2JOJO6ASRYK6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About half the people that come in my home can't use their monthly service phone. No signal. Same with my business, at least half can't use their fancy phones. My new Samsung S425G phone works great in both places. No problem calling or receiving. If you don't spend a ton of time on the phone this is the way to go. It's tons cheaper. You can buy a 3 month, 60 minute card for $20.00. With this phone you get triple minutes so now you have 180 minutes and 3 months to use them at $6.67 a month. It's even cheaper per minute with higher minute cards. If you really don't use your phone much like me then the 400 minute with 12 month service is your best buy. With triple minutes you get 1200 minutes and a year to use them. I've seen the one year card offered by Amazon for Just under $77.00 with free shipping. Lots of time it's offered buy someone else at just under $85.00 and $5.00 shipping. Anyway, if you can catch when Amazon offers it your talking $6.42 a month with 100 minutes you could use per month and not run out of minutes. If you don't use up all your minutes and your monthly service is almost out, you can buy another card and, keeping your service active, it will keep your unused minutes.Besides the phone actually working I love the Mp3 player. You need to get a micro SD card for storing your Mp3s on. You can get a 4 GB for five bucks. I got a 16 GB for fifteen. Max card size you can use is 32 GB. You need a micro USB cable to plug your phone into your computer so you can transfer your music. Max it will let you store on your phones SD card is 1,000 songs. The Mp3 player is laid out nice. You can make playlists, put under artists, album, how ever you want to arrange it. It's so nice because you have a speaker to hear your music if you choose to. You don't have to have ear buds. Now the speaker has no bass, none. How could it have in such a small package. It provides some background tunes when your out side working or taking a long bath or what ever you might be doing. To intently listen to music though you will want ear buds or plug it into your home or car stereo. Which brings up one of two things I don't like. It doesn't have a 3.5mm (1/8\") input jack. You have to buy an adapter as far as I know. Amazon lists them for just under $8.00. I'm going to get one. There might be ear buds designed to fit the micro USB input. I haven't looked. I want the adapter so I can plug into stereos. The other thing I don't like is when playing music with the speaker, the volume doesn't get as low as I would like. Wish it would go one click softer.Works great for texting BUT it's a half minute to send and a half minute to receive. It will only let you send or receive about ten words at a time so you can't get around it with long messages. You need to get to the point of the text if you don't want to use up allot of minutes. So it's going to cost you 4 cents to text your wife to please grab a loaf of bread on the way home from work. The slide out keyboard works great even with my big fingers. It looks so small but I have no problem with it. It's will lit and good looking. In fact the phone is just good looking. High quality throughout.IT IS NOT A TOUCH SCREENYOUR GOING TO WANT A COVER, This thing is the most slippery electronic device I have ever held in my hands. I just new I was going to drop it before my case came but I didn't. I found my case here on Amazon under cell phone covers. I don't remember the name or model but they don't offer that many for the S425G anyway. It was black and about 6 or 7 bucks. It fits perfect. It's hard plastic with a rubberized outside coating. Now my phone has all kinds of grip. You can also safely lay it on its face to hear the speaker better. It adds little to the bulk of the phone.It also has a web browser that works fine but is not near as good as surfing with a computer or tablet. Kind of slow and sucks minutes like a brand new vacuum cleaner. Mine will be used only if there is no other choice.Front display tells you signal strength, battery condition, day & date, time, how many minutes you have left, how many days of service left, what the top three button functions currently due among a few other things. Screen quality is good but not great.It has a 2 MP camera with a small amount of digital zoom. Audio recorder that records your voice or what ever. 4 alarm clocks. Calendar that you can put notes on. I'm pretty sure it will even sound to remind you of something on a set date. I'm still trying to absorb all the features. A place to type in tasks. Memo. Calculator. Tip calculator. Eco calculator for figuring miles per gallon and cost per mile. Converter for converting to metric among other things. World clock. Timer. Stopwatch. SIM APP. (Don't no what that is but it says you have to unlock it). It has Voice Service which is really cool. Just talk to the thing. Say call (name) and it will call who you say as long as that person is in your contact list. Tell it to send message, lookup name. Go to or check. Works every time. Of corse it has voice mail which was easy to set up. Has email but I haven't messed with that. Looks like it might be a little more trouble to set up. Place for pictures. Place for video but has to be in Mp4 (I think) format. Haven't tried that yet either. You can download games and apps. There are supposed to be some free sites but I haven't looked into it.You can download a much better Manuel than the one the phone comes with by searching (support Samsung s425g Manuel)Update  02-12-13 Items I have bought  to use with this phone!Case - Samsung SHG-S425G black hard case cover (described above) $4.47 plus $2.98 shipping (I think they have several colors to choose from. GREAT CASEEarbuds - Samsung OEM stereo earbud headset for Samsung T359 smile (these have the micro USB end so you can plug it directly into your phone) has a button close to the right earbud to answer the phone  I'm guessing. I've never used that feature. One wire is shorter than the other and it so the button doesn't get lost down your shirt or coat. That way you know it's up close to your right ear and easy to find in a hurry. They are comfortable and sound good.  $6.09 with Prime shipping.Earbud Adapter - Samsung micro USB to 3.5mm headset adapter (bulk package) $5.96 plus 99 cents shipping. Use this adapter if you want to plug a set of earbuds into your phone that has the 3.5mm (1/4 inch) male plug on the end. You can also use it with the next item to plug your phone into your car or home stereo for listening to your music.3.5mm Stereo Audio Cable - Startech MU1MMSRA 1 feet slim 3.5mm stereo audio cable. $5.45 Prime shipping. This adapter is 12 inches long, 3.5mm right angle male on one end and 3.5mm straight male on the other end. The only way I could figure out how to plug my phone into my car stereo was to use this cable with the above adapter. I didn't see where Amazon offered one cable that had the necessary micro USB on one end and the 3.5mm male on the other end. This combination works fine for my stereos.Car Kit plus Wall Charger - Stereo headset + car kit + home travel wall charger.  $3.60 plus $2.35 shipping. 12 volt car charger works good. 110 volt wall charger works good. (I know the phone comes with one but I wanted an extra one to leave at work)  the earbuds have the 3.5mm male plug on the end so they won't work with this phone without the adapter mentioned above or one similar.Scandisk 4GB Micro SDHC Memory card. $5.51 Prime shipping. This is probably a big enough card for most people. It will hold hundreds of mp3s and pictures with room to spare. If you think you are going to do much with video then you might consider a 16GB or 32GB card.I read one review and they said their phone was deducting a minute or two a day on its own. My phone has never deducted a second it wasn't supposed to and I have logged every phone call I have made.  It also only subtracts exactly how long you are on the phone. If your on the phone 2 minutes and 8 seconds it subtracts 2 minutes and 8 seconds. The only thing as I said above is texting. One half a minute to send and one half a minute to receive.I'm not a cell phone fan but as cheap as this is to own it's worth having it with me. Ya never know. Mine performs perfectly!Hope this helps you decide!", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best TracFone for most people", "Author": "CrunchyCookie", "ReviewID": "RKWC8B8YYPJQQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently switched to Tracfone after learning that their \"Triple Minutes For Life\" phones make them a better deal than their corporate cousin, Net10.  For us light talkers, Net10's best plan costs $15/month for 150 minutes, whereas Tracfone's Triple Minutes thing lets you get away with paying $10/month for 120 minutes, which is only 8.3 cents per minute (and text messages are 1/3rd of that).  Heck, if you want to take minimalism to the breaking point, you can take it down to $6.67/month for 60 minutes.Anyway, over at Net10 I owned this phone's grandfather (Samsung T401G) and was content with it; so far its descendant is looking just as good.  It has a full load of stuff: 2MP camera, MP3 player, video and voice recorders, Bluetooth, 32GB SD card slot, 4 programmable shortcut keys, voice command, and its highlight, a tactile QWERTY keyboard that slides out sideways.  The display is nice, the menu layout logical and user-friendly, and the 416 MHz processor keep things happening quickly enough.  The camera takes decent pictures in well-lit situations, too.Annoyances: the shared headphone/charger jack is proprietary rather than MicroUSB (though funny enough, Samsung's old proprietary charger doesn't fit, yet a new LG charger does).  The keyboard's fussy in some ways, i.e. the spacebar being half as big as it should be, the apostrophe not having a dedicated key, and the need to aim for the exact center of the keys themselves.  The speaker for the ringer is on the back, which makes no sense.  Finally, Samsung should've let us disable the button for the browser (especially considering what a piece of crap it is), since its permanent placement on the right-side softkey makes you prone to butt-browsing and wasting minutes.  Butt-dialing is also an issue if you don't lock the phone.But all things considered, this S425G still seems like the phone that makes the best sense for the most people.  Tracfone's lower-end models are too bare-bones, and the direct competition consists of the LG 800G (an annoying touchscreen phone), LG 840G (its replacement), LG 505C (appealing but $90), a Motorola EX124G that uses a stylus (WTF), and a couple of boxy Blackberry-like phones, the Samsung S390G and LG 530G.  Aside from the Samsungs that this phone replaced (the T404G & R455C), I don't think anything else has Triple Minutes.So yeah, if you want a good, mid-price phone that's basically good at everything but Internet, this should do the job just fine.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "TracFone Samsung S 425 G", "Author": "Frederick L.

Although the Menu screen looks like a touch screen it is not.Registering it and transferring my minutes was a snap using the TracFone website - successfully completed it in one attempt, including the triple minute feature.I will use it mostly for telephoning and texting, and I found voice reception to be clear both ways, and text sending and receiving to be fine.  The slide out qwerty keyboard is a welcome change from the 12-key keypad on my old phone,and there's ample room to use the top row of keys w/o touching the phone body.Adding new contacts is easy, and the \"Display Name\" feature allows you to access by a nickname or code yet still have the first and last names listed. The directory has three main fields (mobile,landline,email) and six optional ones to reach your contacts.The menu is easily navigated.  While this is no iPhone, the \"Voice Services\" is a fun feature, allows you to utilize features w/o having to use the menu.  It includes an \"Adaption\" option to familiarize the phone to your own voice.I haven't used the camera much as yet, but it has exposure options and then edit options once you've taken a photo, as well as options to forward the photo by email, message, or Blu-tooth.It also has a camcorder function I have't tried.There is a link to an excellent PDF User Manual available for downloading at the TracFone website for this model.Not exactly a smart phone, but not as dumb as my previous phone, and I am very satisfied with the product and price! Samsung S425G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone)", "Date": "October 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tracfone - Straight Talk - Net 10  Same Phone", "Author": "Mmaw", "ReviewID": "R39JJ8EOBCM4NC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like the phone although it seems to be a forgotten phone on the internet.  This same phone is used for Straight Talk which is twice the price of Tracfone Samsung S425G.  It is also used by Net 10.  That's a new one to me unless they are all partners with one another. I have NO idea! I am very pleased with the phone - whoever it's connected with. I became very use(d) to the keyboard and did NOT want to go to a data plan, not worth the expense for me. Just this past week I was in Charleston, SC and made calls to Indiana.  Excellent Perception.  What I really like about the phone and the Tracfone plan - you pay for what you use: 15 seconds, you pay for 15 seconds, NOT 60 seconds. 45 seconds = 45 seconds, NOT one minute.  The benefit with Tracfone - The more you buy at one time, the less it costs per minute or unit.  You know how much time you spend on the phone, the very reason I use prepaid.  I do NOT live on the cell phone, or any other phone, for that matter.  However, more and more people are going to cells abd I receive far more calls and texts than I make.  Buying more makes it cheaper / more affordable for me in every way, receiving and sending.  The pictures (grandchildren) are crisp and the color is beautiful.  I was quite leary of using the \"Tracfone\" instead of Straight Talk (WalMart - a more affordable choice than other networks).  But, don't be afraid of the SAME phone with a different supplier.  I don't regret the purchase of the phone at all. Nor do I regret trying Tracfone. Flies and honey as I always say - the sweeter the honey (deal) the more flies (customers)that will return bringing other friendly flies to feast. Thank you Tracfone, for the phone AND the plan.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "One of the best TracFones right now", "Author": "Just Me", "ReviewID": "R1DEWRMV95CEQ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me preface this by saying I started with TracFone 10+ years ago when I rarely used the phone, and it was 50 cents a minute. Now, I have a family plan on T-Mobile with my fancy Samsung Galaxy Note II. However, I still have my same TracFone line and number as an extra line. I've had pretty much every TracFone available and upgrade when I see something worth upgrading to.The S425g is the perfect phone if you must have a physical slide out QWERTY keyboard. The keyboard has a very good tactile feel and just works well. A separate number row at the top of the keyboard would be nice but it would also make the phone more bulky, so it's a worthy trade off.Call quality is great, and a bonus is that this phone is 3G-capable. Most of TracFones phones are 1X aka 2G so your coverage is more limited nationwide if you travel. This phone uses AT&T;'s network via TracFone, and coverage has been great. Battery life on the phone has also been very good. I charge it once a week since I rarely use my TracFone.IMPORTANT: because this phone is 3G, it uses the new (and unfortunately poorly documented) internet/data charge rate structure. You are charged by the 'byte' as opposed to the old way of 0.5/unit per minute of being online. So, you gain much faster data, but you have to pay more for it. I have a lot of minutes built up so I prefer this, but I know this is a let down for some folks. Picture messaging also uses data, so rather than the old rate of maybe 1.5-2 units per picture sent/received, this one can range from 3-9 units depending on how large the picture is.As long as you keep the price of this phone in mind, you'll be happy. It's not a smartphone, and doesn't try to be. Don't expect to have a super duper great web browsing experience on this phone, because you won't get it here. This phone excels at calls and text messages, with the occasional web browsing if you need to quickly Google something.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone gets a 4, Documentation gets a ZERO", "Author": "Barbara \"Digger's Domain\"", "ReviewID": "ROIO8FYGX4W25", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had Tracfone for about 5 years. Up until a week ago used a $9 Motorola flip phone, which I loved because it reminded me of a Star Trek communicator. It's only drawback was that I could not upload and use ringtones that I had made myself, and I yearned to have \"This is the voice of the Mysterons. We know that you can hear us, Earthmen\" as my ringtone.So I finally gave in last week and bought this phone. I transferred both time *and* minutes from my Motorola, which I had not thought I could do. Also transferred my old number, and it took about two days for that to activate. (If you bought your phone in one zipcode, have moved, but kept your old phone number, make sure you give your *old* zipcode and not your new zipcode when activating any new phone. Otherwise, folks who used to be able to dial you by area code and then phone number will have to put a 1 in front of the area code, otherwise they'll be told the number has disconnected. Alternatively they'll just get a busy signal.The documentation for this phone sucks, nevertheless I tried to figure out everything myself instead of calling customer service because the last time I did that, a few years ago when trying to figure out how to get my personalized ringtones on my Motorola, I did not have access to a native-English speaking helper, and the question I was asking could not get through to her.I'll tell you what worked for me - your mileage may vary.So anyway, it has an MP3 player. You do not need special software to transfer music or radio drama from your computer to your phone. I used the USB cable that I got for my Kindle. Turned off the phone, put one end of the USB cable into my phone (same spot where the charger goes) and the other end into my laptop. The phone popped into life and started looking like it was charging its battery which had me nervous, but all was well, it was installing software on my laptop. Then I opened up my Computer, and there was my phone (identified by the nickname I had given it). I doubleclicked on the title to open it and could not do it - it said it didn't have the right kind of file to be opened. However, on a whim, I dragged the icon from a 25-minute radio program from my laptop onto that title...and it began copying. A phone screen popped up on the phone which asked me where I wanted the copy to go to, and I said my SD card. Took no time at all to copy it. Turned off my phone, unplugged the USB cord, turned it back on, found my SD card and played the radio program. The volume is low, but that's the only drawback.Setting up emailIt took me two days to figure out how to set up my email. Suffice it to say if you set up an account and make some mistake, delete it and try again. Or maybe don't name your email account the same as your nickname for your phone...maybe that was my trouble. Anyway, it asks for you to name your account, and input your email. Use your computer email - your yahoo.com address or whatever. Make sure you scroll down and fill out all the fields it asks you for. In the receiving fields, it will sync with your computer email and you can set it for when it will do this - every half hour, hour, up to a day.Personalized ringtonesThe first time I set up my email, I failed. Didn't know what to put in for the email, thought I had to use my phone number. (Not so, that's for text messages.) So I instead used the recorder to record the ringtones I wanted, and save them to my SD card.Ringtones for messages, alarms, callsThere are two different places where you set this up. For messages, you have to do it in Settings>Sound Profile>Edit. Here, you can select, using the exterior chrome around the big button on your phone) Call, Message, or Phone. Call alert type is melody for sound, or vibrate. Again, you have to scroll down to see all the fields. For messages, the only ringtones I could get to were the ones on my SD card, not on the phone itself. But it's easy to move ringtones and recorded audio from your phone to the SD card.To set ring tones for alarms and individual callers, you do that through your My Folder>Audio. Listen to it, click properties, use Set as.Downloading personalize ringtonesOnce you get your email set up, simply send a message to yourself, and attach a ring tone. It can be no larger than 21 kb. Then, when your phone syncs to your email, open that particular email. The default is for it just to download the title. \"Retrieve\" the entire email. Then, using the chrome directional thingy (around your main button) scroll down through the email til it highlights the attached ringtone. Select it, it will ask if you want to save it and where to. Simply put it on your SD card.As for the phone turning on when you get a call - I thought I'd imagined this but apparently it happened to someone else. Also, my phone turned on to wake me up in the morning, which I wasn't happy about. (But it played my \"Surface agent X20, what have you to report\" personalized ringtone, so that made me happy.)The keyboard does lock after a ridiculously short time, only a couple of seconds. I unlocked it for good in tools when I'm at home, but set it back to lock when I go out and about.Also under tools you can set a password to get into your phone. I haven't done this because I don't have any sensitive material on my phone, but if you do, set a password and make sure it's one you can remember.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "samsung s425g tracfone", "Author": "EaglesFan", "ReviewID": "R2AB24BB6SH2GF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone.

My last one was an LG and the batteries are horrible for holding charges. Even after purchasing an extra one, I always had to worry about whether or not my phone would work when I needed it because the charges were so erratic with holding their charge. So far the battery is working well with the Samsung. The number pad is nice sized (no tiny buttons), the touch screen is nice to have, and the slide out keypad is great for texting (even though I don't do much of that).

I like having a phone charged and ready if I put it in a drawer for a week but at the same time I have big clumsy sausage fingers.  This turned out to be the phone for me!  It has excellent battery life and the full slide out keyboard is so much larger than my LG500g.  I found that the battery life on smartphones is terrible for somebody like me that doesn't use their phone every day.  I also like feeling the keys unlike the virtual keyboard on smartphones.  Plus, when the keyboard slides out the screen turns sideways and faces you to make texting even easier.This phone has bluetooth, camera, full QWERTY slide out keyboard, and speaker phone.  It also has a micro SD (the directions say it takes up to 32 GB but I used a 4 GB with FAT32 file system) slot on the side for ease of accessibility unlike my LG500g that put the micro SD card behind the battery.  Additionally, I like the feel of the big number keys on the front of the phone.  You can also hook this up to your email account and it has a browser, though I haven't tried this since I just get on a computer with a big screen to do anything on the net.There are 3 things some people may not like.  First is that there is no headphone jack on this phone.  It has bluetooth and I imagine that you could just get a bluetooth ear piece for phone calls or a pair of bluetooth headphones to listen to mp3s.  Second is that it's difficult to get your old phone book into this phone.  My other phone (LG500GHL) was able to send my entire phone book in 1 file.  This new phone connected to the LG just fine with bluetooth and got the file but only put 1 of 88 entries into my phone book.  I also could not get it to restore my old phonebook by a file on the SD card.  I wound up sending each entry in my phone book over bluetooth using the send as business card option on my LG.  This had to be done 88 times and was very tedious.  Fortunately I only had to go through this process once.  Finally, I cannot now find a way of backing up my phone book on this Samsung.Now about changing alert tones.  The default Samsung sound for incoming texts is a bird whistle.  This can be a rather embarrassing sound when you're a guy in the room with a bunch of other guys!  I had to apologize on behalf of my phone when I first got a text.  The instructions with this phone didn't explain how to change it.  Go into your sound profile section and enter the normal profile.  From there you can change text sounds to other canned sounds or pick other sounds to take one off your micro SD card (my sound is an mp3 file on my micro SD).  Menu>Settings>Sound Profile>Normal>Call or Message Tab>Call Ringtone or Message Alert Tone.Oh, and the triple minutes on this phone is nice.  I buy $30 cards every 3 months and I'm sure that'll be more than enough for me and then the extra minutes just roll over :)I would definitely recommend this to anybody who wants a good reliable phone with ease of texting!I just found out something really cool.  First let me tell you that I thought it strange that this phone had no games installed.  Well, I think this is intentional so that there will be space for you to install what you want.  I searched around and found a couple sites with games for this phone.  This phone takes non-Tracfone java apps with a 240X320 screen size.  I was able to install a couple different Sudoku Games, Bejeweled Twist and Google Maps from my SD card.  You should turn the phone off before ejecting your micro SD card!  I just found the download links on the web and chose download to pc.  After that I copied them to the card which I then put in the phone and then went to the My Folder and then pushed the rocker to the right to tab over to On Card and selected the java file (.jar).  It will prompt you that the content is not signed.  Press Cont. to proceed and then Install and Play.  If all installed OK, the app will show up under Games & Apps.  Pressing the option button in Games & Apps will let you delete the app if it didn't install right.  Remember to shut the phone down again if you want to eject the SD card again.One last thing-the slide out keyboard does light up...pretty cool!!", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not for me", "Author": "Cynthia Stout", "ReviewID": "R1494IP2B8UIUO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone got good reception, that's the best thing I can say about it.

Most annoying, is the puritan dictionary / profanity filter when typing messages. I am a dog breeder and I had to add a very common word that kept autocorrecting to \"birch\". Once you are done compiling your naughty list, this problem goes away. My second major gripe is that you cannot use your music files for ringtones or alarms. The phone displays a message indicating \"too large to set as ...\". Yes I know I can manually edit them down on my PC and put them on the MicroSD card, but I did not have this problem with my previous Motorola EX124G. My third complaint is regarding the excessive charge to send a picture message. My old phone it cost about 1 minute, but this phone it takes between 6-8  minutes to send 1 picture. Now mind you I had a 3 megapixel camera previously (this one is only 2mp), but it may have resized them differently. Overall I'm trying to adapt going from a touch phone to a slider.

I haven't found a way to change it.  Also, only try to view web pages without pics, or it will be horribly slow and eat up your minutes.  It can do very well on text-only pages (I recommend Weather Underground Braille pages for weather).  I agree that the web browser button is entirely too easy to hit accidentally.  It should ask you to confirm that you really want to browse, rather than just start eating up your minutes.2) Very slow to send and receive pics, and frequently fails.  I gave up on that, and now send my pics to my PC via the data cable and micro SD card I bought, then email them from there.3) Sending pics or anything else to or from PC not only requires that you buy a cable to connect them, but also a micro SD card, as it refuses to transfer anything from/to internal memory directly.  You must send it to the micro SD card first.4) I lost ability to send international texts, versus my previous phone, but this is probably a limitation of my carrier, TracFone, and not the phone itself.  I can still receive international texts.5) There are some absurdly low limits on text string lengths you should be aware of:5a) Alarms and calendar appointments, anniversaries, holidays, etc., are limited to 15 character titles, while there's room for 22 in the portrait (vertical) display mode, and 28 in landscape (horizontal) display mode (of course, they could always go to scrolling beyond that).  So, we just have unusable blank space on the line.5b) Text memos are limited to 100 characters each, despite having room for about 180 characters on the screen in portrait (vertical) mode and 168 in landscape (horizontal) mode.  The result is more unusable empty space on the screen.6) After completing things, it often prompts you to hit \"OK ?\", but this prompt goes away in a second, so, if you try to hit that button, it will then do something annoying (whatever that button is set to do after the OK prompt disappears).7) You can manually put it in sleep mode by holding down the \"*\" button on the main menu.  I recommend this to save the battery, after each use.  (You could also set the automatic sleep mode timer low, but that's really annoying when it puts it to sleep while you're reading a text, etc.)  Surprisingly, it also puts it in sleep mode when you're talking on the phone, once the sleep timer elapses.  (You can still talk, but the screen goes black.)8) An alarm takes it out of sleep mode, so your battery can run down.9) You can't immediately go to speakerphone on an incoming call, because the \"1.00 unit / minute\" rate message display blocks that option for 4 seconds.  So I end up saying \"Please wait\" until I am allowed to activate it.10) There's an option on alarms to make the volume steadily increase. Unfortunately, it doesn't make it a bit louder each time the alarm repeats, every 5 minutes, but during a single ring tone.  So, it rapidly increases from quiet to loud, over a minute instead of an hour.  Still better than a jarringly loud alarm right away, but not as good as it could be.11) There are some oddities you should be aware of with the calendar:11a) Holidays don't have times associated with them, so you can't schedule a holiday dinner that way.  You'd need to pick \"Appointment\", \"Important\", or \"Private\", instead.11b) Anniversaries have an alarm, but can only be days or weeks before the event, not hours before.  If you want the alarm to sound hours before, you'd need to put the time of the event in as when you want the alarm to go off, not at the actual start of the event.11c) \"Holidays\" are shown by turning the day red, which looks a lot like the red Sundays.  Both \"Anniversary\" and \"Private\" use yellow markers to show the day, which could be confusing. (They are on opposite corners of the day.)  \"Appointments\" are shown with blue markers, and \"Important\" with red.11d) The \"repeat\" option for calendar events doesn't repeat the alarm, but the event itself, like a daily, weekly, or monthly meeting.  I'd like to be able to have the alarm repeat, too, like it does for a regular alarm.  Also, repeated events don't properly handle events that are on different days each year, like Easter.11e) It's not very smart about start and end times. The start time defaults to midnight and the end time defaults to 1 AM.  So, if you change the start time to anything after 1 AM, it then complains that you can't have an end time before the start time.  I find this quite annoying when dealing with things which don't really have a scheduled end time, like dinner.  You have to make one up anyway, to keep it from bitching at you.11f) Again, it has a really low limit, for no apparent reason, on the total number of calendar entries.  It seems to be around 120.  So, you need to delete them as you hit them, or else, even if you only have one calendar item per day, you will overflow your calendar in about 4 months.12) I can only get phone to ring for 20 seconds before if cuts off.  This might be related to my carrier, TracFone.  This isn't enough time if I'm in the other room.13) Since you can list several phone numbers for each contact, it's not at all obvious which one it will pick when you select \"Call\" when on the name of a contact.  I think the logic is to pick the top number, unless you specifically view the contact and scroll to another number, but I'm not positive.14) No cover comes with this phone, how cheap !15) It's not that easy to plug in the charger into the phone.  I long for my old cell phone, with a circular plug, that you could plug into in any rotation, even in the dark.16) The QWERTY keyboard doesn't have separate numbers, so you have to keep switching modes between text and numeric, and each switch takes up to 3 clicks, since there are 4 entry modes (\"lowercase text\", \"uppercase text\", \"numeric\", and \"uppercase text for one character, then lowercase\").  This makes it quite time consuming to enter mixed text and numbers.  You might think you could just use the regular numeric keyboard to enter numbers, but, nope, when the QWERTY keyboard slides out, those keys are disabled. The best alternative is to hold the function key down on the QWERTY keyboard, which gives you numbers and symbols instead of text. This might sound good, but it requires 2 free hands or a piano player. You can also hit the function key once before each number, but that's just as slow. As for text entry, it does know to make the single letter \"I\" capital, and the first letter at the start of a sentence. (It also had T9 mode for word recognition and completion, but fortunately I was able to disable that travesty.)17) While it tells you the length of calls to the second, TracFone rounds up to the nearest minute for billing. During a call, it alternates between displaying the length of the current call and your minutes remaining on the phone.18) If you miss a reminder, it will keep popping up a message that you missed it, forever, until you pick \"View\" and then \"Confirm\".  If you miss a call, it's even worse.  As near as I can tell, you have to call the person back to clear the missed call, otherwise it will pop up behind each incoming text message.19) I sometimes get the message \"Emergency calls only\" when I try to make a call during the day.  I assume this means TracFone's circuits are overloaded.20) There's a fairly low limit on number of incoming texts it can store in memory (maybe 100 ?), so you need to delete them after you read each, keeping only the critical ones.  These limits seem to be designed for an era when memory was far smaller than it is today.  With an added memory card, it should be able to store like 1000x as much data, but they apparently don't take this into account, and keep these really low limits no matter what memory the device has available.21) Messages + Sentbox (the texts you've sent out) doesn't seem to be sorted at all, they are just in random order.  After you send a few hundred texts, that means that it's impossible to find anything, even the last text you sent.  The Inbox sorts properly, by the order received.22) Note that almost all the negatives are software, not hardware, so they could presumably make this a much better phone with a software upgrade.Now for some positives:A) You can associate both a pic and ring tone with each contact.  The ring tone can even be something you record with the phone, so you could have the person say their name, for example, and also see their pic on the phone when they call.B) You can also record audio memos, although I find text memos easier to use.C) When you manually dial a phone number, you get huge numbers, which are easy to see, and properly formatted for US numbers, with the area code and dash on the top line, the exchange and dash on the 2nd line, and the last 4 digits on the 3rd line.  I can't stand phones that skip the dashes or break it up in odd ways.D) The main menu displays just about everything I'd want: the date, day of the week, time (no seconds), minutes remaining and service days left, under TracFone.  Of course, the battery life remaining and signal strength are also displayed, as icons, along with messages for missed texts, calls, etc.  I do wish they displayed seconds, though, so I wouldn't have to bring up the stopwatch or timer app, say when checking my heart rate.E) You can send very long texts, although over 160 characters, it bills for 2 texts, and over 305 characters, it bills for 3, under TracFone.  A number by a dog-eared page icon appears in the lower, left corner, to tell you how many texts you will be billed for.  If you send the text to multiple people, multiply by that number, too.  So, a 3 page text sent to 4 people would be billed as 12 texts.And here's a money-saving hint:Don't set up the voice mailbox. Without it, people can't leave messages, but you do get a log on your phone of who called and when (or just a number and time, if they aren't in your contact list). But, this way, you don't have to burn minutes to retrieve messages which might just be from a telemarketer. If you have a missed call from somebody you actually want to talk to, you can call them back. Or, if they insist on leaving you a message, they can text you. I look up numbers I don't recognize on the Internet from my PC, just to find out which telemarketer they are.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "SOLID,  BUT NOT WITHOUT LIMITATIONS", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Bullone\"", "ReviewID": "R219DFQ57UIRF7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If telephone and texting fit your needs this is a nice phone.

The selling price on the phone itself is more than reasonable, and the \"Triple Minutes\" for life feature speaks for itself.  Best bet is to buy \"Airtime Minutes\" from a 3rd party website instead of the official Tracfone website.  There are plenty of reputable sites that off a very marginally cheaper rate, but give you the added bonus of \"Bonus Minutes\"  For a mere $29.69 I bought 120 minutes which in turn turns into 360 minutes after the \"Triple Minutes\" THEN got an additional 30 \"Bonus Minutes\" from the website for free.  So for $29.69 I got 390 minutes AND/OR 90 additional days of service.If you're anything like me, you don't talk on the phone at any given time for longer than 5-10 minutes.  So for just under $30 you can talk on the phone virtually limitless amounts for 3 full months (Assuming you talk/text as little as myself).As for the phone itself, it won't win any beauty contests...It has a very dated look to it, sliding phones apparently are not cool anymore, who knew?It's not touch screen, but that's fine with me, my OCD kicks in with anything touch screen and I cant help but wipe the screen after every use.It's EXTREMELY simplistic in it's menu navigation.I have yet to actually use the browser, but I would imagine it's quite horrible, but let's be honest...

What attracted me to the phone was the potential savings and the triple minutes. Considering that I don't make or receive a lot of phone calls, this phone makes a lot of sense and will have a payback period of less than 6 months. That being said, one has to be disciplined about using the phone. You start using your minutes from the time you press the send key until the time you press the end key. If you dial a number and get a busy signal or wrong number,or dial your voice mail, you get your minutes docked a minute. So you could easily use your monthly minutes up very quickly if you are careless.It is also less costly to send text messages than to make phone calls; sending a text message docks your minutes about .05 instead of a full minute for a phone call. Making a phone call also rounds up your minutes, so if you make a call, that is 1.05 minutes, you will get charged for two.Cons:Web Browser - will consume your minutes without giving you anything in return. You cannot type anything into search fields, so you could not do do a google search. Nor can you log into your facebook account. Wasted 20 minutes of phone time with nothing to show for it.Email - though there is a wizard to ease setting up accounts, when I use the values it set up, I could not login to my account. Have yet to download email, yet still get charged for the attempt.Bluetooth - I tried to use bluetooth to transfer images from the phone to my PC. You have only 3 minutes for the pairing to take place, and if there are problems, you have to start over. Would get connection failed messages; samsung support was of no use, and good luck getting a technical explanation of how to get it to work from tracfone. You can also download a program called PC Studio to move files back and forth between your phone and PC, but found this program unbearably slow, so removed it removed my PC. To transfer files, I could only use the USB data cable.MP3 player - copied a music cd title to the phone's memory, but couldn't get the player to play the tune because it wasn't in the right format. So if you want to copy music from your CD collection, you will have to use some sort of conversion program to get it into a supported format.Recording - tried to record from stereo at half full volume, but when I played back the audio, the sound was garbled. Had turned downed the volume controls to keep phone from ringing in vibration mode and on startup; apparently affects quality of sound.Phone - even though the phone is supposed to work for my zip code, and I can call my landline, during busy periods, I get \"check call restriction -34 \" messages. So there is little guarantee that when I actually need to use the phone, I will be able to get service. Also, in there service booklet, they tell you that in an emergency, you should search for a landline. Anybody try that scenario out recently; really negates the point of having a mobile phone to begin with.Tracfone support - you can obtain support from tracfone, but only if you fill out a support request. If you just have a question on how to do something, they will not answer the question without a support ticket. And generally speaking, the kind of answers you get is very uneven. Also, when I filled out a support ticket complaining about the call restrictions, they said I needed a new phone, but the phone I am receiving is only a double minutes phone that is $20 cheaper than the one I purchased. When they replace a phone, you have absolutely no choice on what phone you receive. They also make up the difference in the price of your replacement by adding minutes at their fullfillment center, so you don't get the advantage of triple or double minutes.Update:Tracfone sent me a new SIM card that would work on T-mobile. The connection issues went away. So I tried to download google maps application, and just opening one web page ([...]) cost me 22 minutes of phone time.

When I received it. I went through the web to transfer from my prior tracfone, both phone number and minutes. I first went to their website which tried to transfer only a portion of my minutes, so I aborted that. Then I called, ended up with an automated system which said, OK wait hours or up to 2 business days to transfer. So I went about using my old phone. (now Saturday), I noticed that my old phone now said unrecognized SIM, IE unusable, but still had the same expiration date and minutes. My new phone said unrecognized SIM. IE both now were unusable. I waited for hours and tried, as per their suggestion, to no avail. It is now Sunday morning. I go through Tracfone's website, which informs me that a change is in process, and to wait 5 minutes. I wait 5, then try to find tracfone's actual phone number. I finally found it , and then noticed that my new phone was rebooting. After that, I turned it off then on and behold it worked. (It was closer to 10 minutes). I probably could have gone through the process when my old phone was unrecognized yesterday. So I finally can give it a try.My intended use of my phone is, other than for emergencies, is for travel. When we travel, we are always wanting to find the cheapest gas (gasbuddy) or weather or road conditions or food stops etc. Not so much email or the like. I will report when I have some experience. I just got gasbuddy set up, it took 2 minutes of time from my minutes. Not so bad.-One Month later.I still like the phone. It does what I needed it to do.  I downloaded the mini opera browser and it works on some websites better than the built in browser. The Samsung software (New PC Studio) needed to allow you to transfer info from the phone to the PC (Mine is win XP) would lock up my computer every time. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it now works. It was locking up my other USB inputs (mouse and keyboard)As to butt dialing. If the phone was off, it didn't happen, however, the phone when on, locks the keyboard. I thought I was turning it off, but it still had a locked keyboard so stayed on. Also if you have your email set up to turn on and check on a regular basis, it may accept a call when checking email.

Samsung offers also a PC application called New PC Studio for Contact syncing and various file transfers which can include mobile javascript apps that are found on the Internet. They are limited (called midlets or J2ME) that run. Now this is not a smart phone but does have some outside uses.I use infrequent minutes and Tracfone's Pay As You Go prepaid no contract plan is inexpensive. I purchased only a 60 minute 90 service day card for about $20 but with the triple minutes for life gave me 180 minutes. I don't quite understand it but I also received 150 service days. Perhaps a promotion was going on.My application for this besides ordering take-out food while on the move and having it for emergencies, also lets me look at weather radar and cloud images from the Internet to plan photo shooting in nature reserved. A typical current weather data plus a forecast and a cloud and radar image uses about four to six minutes (one minute charge per megabyte).You do need to order a micro USB cable to connect to a PC directly from Samsung although it is listed by third party sellers for sync and file transfer applications.

However, I'm finding myself increasingly annoyed by its quirks, so I dropped it down to 3 stars.In the interest of being slightly more concise while not discouraging others from buying this phone, I'm going to leave my original positive points, while listing only the negatives that I find the most annoying. If the things which I find to be a hassle aren't going to be an issue for you, then I suspect as so many other reviewers have found, that you may be very happy with this phone. But for me, I'm just finding it to be frustrating compared with the simpler (though much less feature-rich) Motorola C139 which I had to replace.Given that I'm a heavy texter and a very light talker, the rates offered by Tracfone are better than any other prepaid / pay-as-you-go rates plans I could find.The other feature which I use heavily is the calendar and its associated reminders, and that's where this phone just doesn't cut it for me.Pros:* The phone has a very solid feel. Nothing cheap about it. The keys are neither too soft nor too hard.* The voice quality is very good, and the speakerphone seems reasonable.* There's flexibility for adding multiple numbers (both landline & cell) as well as an email address, in each contact entry.* I'm very pleased with the email feature, both in terms of functionality and cost. It was simple to set up. When downloading emails, you'll see the subject line and sender, and then can choose to download the full text of individual emails; you can download attachments or just the text. You're limited to 100k sending/receiving at a time, but that's not a concern for me. The cost, unless you're sending/receiving pictures, is significantly less than texting. The only reason I would have gotten the LG 840G with WiFi was so that I could periodically use email or get to the web without having to use up minutes, but this is much more cost effective than I would have expected, and is one of the most pleasant surprises I've encountered with the phone.* The ability to assign shortcuts with the Go To key is very helpful and flexible. You can assign top level menus or some sub-menus (e.g., top level \"Messages\", or sub-menus \"Create Message\", \"Inbox\", \"Email\", etc).* When creating a text or email, it will show your recent contacts, or if you want to choose from all your contacts, it will only show you the applicable ones (i.e., those with a cell number for texting, or an email address).* The browser is relatively inexpensive for text-only sites. You're charged by the amount of data you transfer, not how long you're in the browser. Another reviewer (StuRat) recommended the Weather Underground Braille pages, and I find they work very well. The other sites I have bookmarked are CNN's home page, RSS pages from Sports Illustrated and AP, and Google Search. I find that RSS pages are particularly useful, as they're almost completely text, and provide the ability to see the headlines without having to click on a more costly page. StuRat also mentioned the Wikipedia pages for mobile devices, but I haven't tried them yet,Cons:* Switching between different text input modes (T9/abc/symbolic) is rather confusing. You can change it in \"Options\" when texting, but only with the * key when creating memos, calendar entries, or tasks. Also, the last setting you used will come up whether you're in portrait (keypad) or landscape (slider keyboard) mode, so if you've been using T9 in portrait, the next time you use the slider keyboard, it will start in T9 mode instead of Abc mode. All of this makes it hard to send a quick test reply in portrait mode if you had previously been using the slider.* The volume keys on the side only affect incoming calls, not text or alarm volume. The only way to change the alert volume for texts is from within the \"Sound Profile\" settings. With my old phone, I could rely on the volume changing for calls/texts/alarms. I've had to resort to setting up the \"Driving\" sound profile for use at work and my normal profile for the rest of the time.* The calendar is anything but intuitive. Too complicated with too many required fields, and hard to know exactly what it's going to do. As another reviewer mentioned, the end time defaults to 1:00 AM, so if you change the start time to anything reasonable, it will complain about the end time. My old phone's system of defaulting the start time to the current time, and giving a default duration of 1 hour, is so much simpler.* Alarms from calendar entries and tasks which occur when the phone is powered off, will not show up once you power the phone on.* An alarm which comes in while the keyboard is locked, will cause it to unlock.* For recurring appointments, you appear to have the option of \"repeat monthly on day\" versus \"repeat monthly on date\", but there seems to be no way to chose the former.* There is no setting to automatically delete old appointments after a certain number of days, so you'll have to delete them yourself in order to avoid hitting the limit of 100.* Unless you use speed dial, calling a contact definitely takes too many key presses. It's 4 steps using the \"Quick Launch\" button on the side, and I don't think there's a faster way, even with the \"Go To\" shortcuts.* Unless you set the default phone numbers for calls & texts in a contact entry, it's hard to know what number it will use if there are multiple numbers in the entry. But even with the defaults set up, if reply to an incoming message, it's not always clear whether you'll end up sending a text or an email. I've seen what appears like a short code (5 digit text number) appear as the recipient for a reply to an an email, so I decided to delete it and then choose the contact again so I could be sure I was sending an email.I want to like this phone, but it seems that I'm having to work for it, instead of it working for me. If I eventually get to where I'm more comfortable with it, I will gladly bump it back up to 4 stars.***********************************************************************************One more update. I only got a new phone because I was having issues with long texts on my old phone giving me an \"Incomplete Concatenated Message\" error periodically. Well, today I got a 415 byte text that was garbled. The same part of the message repeated itself over & over, with the rest of it never coming through. I suspect there are issues with Tracfone and AT&T; in my area. I won't dock any stars from the review for that, but after my minutes are gone, I'll be done with Tracfone and go with another carrier.

I was hoping the phone was going to be useful for saving notes & contact info like my old Nokia 9300, which was great for \"thumb typing\" with both hands, but the 425's keyboard is so small, it's not practical for use by most men. This is a problem with all new cellphones, the keyboards seem to be designed for little girls (don't the manufacturers realize that men use cells too?).Anyhow, if you get this phone, you will probably need to download \"New PC Studio\" from Samsung's site so you can back up your contacts etc. For some reason, I sometimes have to power down the phone before it will work with the PC Studio app. I couldn't find any way to backup the phone to the SD card (forget the SIM card).One odd thing is that although this phone has an mp3 player, there is no earphone jack & the Bluetooth doesn't work with audio (headphones etc.).

If you try and send a message it deducts the time immediately from your phone even if the text doesn't send. Each attempt you try and send deducts time from you. You can be showing 0 bars or 3 bars for signal strength and it send right away. Then you can show 3 bars and it won't send. There seems to be no pattern for this other than the phone steals your 'minutes' away at each attempt. I consider one definition of theft as paying for a service that isn't provided and that's what this phone and/or service does many times. If it wasn't for the triple minutes i'd probably be broke right now, but am I really getting triple minutes when it takes multiple attempts to send one text?

I got fed up with one of the major carrier's high monthly cost for a Droid smartphone, about $100.  With my usage on this Samsung phone my cost is about $12/month when I buy minutes in bulk (thanks to triple minutes).  I only use this for basic phone and SMS texting.  I do not use the web browser and haven't tried playing music from it. I don't check email on it or any other data service.First the good:- Porting of the number was easy.- Indestructible.  I've dropped this numerous times on pavement without so much as a scratch.  I took it to the beach and it fell out of my pocket into the sand.  I was able to use canned air to blow the sand out of it and it still works great.- Battery life.  I get about 6 days of moderate use, about 10-20 texts a day and a couple dozen minutes of talking.- keyboard is nice, buttons are illuminated and provide a nice tactile feedback when typing.  I would say this is as good as my Droid 2 smartphone was.- Bluetooth works nice, paired and when I talk on it I usually use my BT earpiece.- Camera isn't bad and nice to take quick pictures of something.  I've been able to tweet a picture from this phone via SMS.- I was able to easily import the address book from my Droid 2 using the Samsung PC Studio.The bad:- If I miss a call the notification is there for days or weeks.  I can't seem to clear it.- No easy way to turn on vibrate only for notifications.  The volume switch on the side will only make it go completely silent.  My Droid let me hit the down button once after silent and it would turn on virbrate.- Non-Samsung micro USB wall chargers will not work with this phone.  I have several from my Droid 2 and they do not work with this.  The Samsung charger works and connecting it to a computer via USB cable will charge it.- The web browser button gets hit by accident a couple times a month which causes me to loose a couple units.- Can't delete pictures that came with the phone, which takes up space.Overall not a bad little phone.  My requirements were to have a QWERTY slide out keyboard, bluetooth and prepaid--which this phone does well.  I do have problems with reception more so than with my Droid 2, but I am also on a different carrier.

Lots of features, nicely thought out.  I get good cell reception and call quality.  I like the larger than normal screen and the slide out qwerty keyboard.  I have huge fingers (sausages) and have to be careful when using the keyboard.  Not a fault of the keyboard, people with normal sized fingers should have no problem.  The internet capabiity is actually not bad at all (I rememberTracfone's early attempts at internet connectivity and it was very frustrating).  However, I would not recommend the phone for someone who wants to spend a lot of time on the internet.  Its perfectly fine for the casual user.  Not enough feature capabilty for a heavy user.  Does not support playing of streaming video.  Able to take pictures and video.  Has better than usual battery life when compared to other phones.  Supports a vocal command interface.  I've owned several non-smart phones and this is the most feature rich one I have so far encountered.  There is a free app available from Samsung that will allow you to sync the calendar, events and phone book entries between a PC and the phone.  I LOVE this app!  Store all that information on the PC for back-up/restoration.  If the data gets damaged on the phone some-how, I can get it all restored from my PC in about a minute.  I also like the ability to put a 32GB storage chip in the phone.  I've got about 20 full length movies and the entire 7 or 8 years of the TV series Northern Exposure loaded on mine with about 1/3 of the memory chip still available.  The picture quality is amazingly sharp and colors true.  In order to load this type of video, you will have to buy some software that reads DVD's and digitally stores them according to the screen size of the phone.

Lots of steps for a text.A little background:  I lost my LG phone with the touch screen.  That phone was excellent in all ways except texting on the touch screen was horrible unless you used a closed pen tip as a stylus and the touch part had to be a deliberate push/hold in order to key in or select.  My daughter is a literal pro with phones and couldnt get it to work properly without exagerated movement.  She really, really didn't like that phone because of that. lol  Other than that, it was a great phone!I never take the time to do in-depth reviews because it's not that important and usually something that's already been said.  So the norm is pretty brief.  I probably do too much information on this one just because I wish I'd seen this info before I bought this phone.  I would have looked for a different one just because of my personal preferences and this one kind of goes backward in basic quality, features and ease of use.  For me anyway.I was excited to get this phone because I much prefer the slider keyboard.  And the keyboard is great. The numbers on the keyboard are on the right, which means you don't have to stretch to the other side to enter. I think it's easier for right handed people.  Not sure. lol  The phone volume seems loud enough for me with my bad hearing and it does have a speaker phone feature.  My husband said it sounded good on his end but it sounded like it had noise cancellation or something which made it sound like there were gaps in the conversation so you end up talking over each other since you didn't hear them start to talk.  Lots of stumbling in conversation sometimes.  Just have to get used to that I guess.  The phone came with no games, and some pretty ugly ring tones to choose from.  There isn't an icon for the camera.  You have to go into tools and select it.  Same with Calendar, Alarm and etc.  You would think you could choose your icons or have two icon screens for the extras.  There are two small buttons on the lower right outside edge of the phone. These are \"short cuts\", one for the camera and the other is for a small row of feature choices, on the on the bottom of the screen.  They include phone call (which just gives you a screen to hand enter a phone number which is normally done on the opening first screen), texting, browser, music, games, and believe it or not, back to the opening screen.  You could have just hit End or Back rather than scroll over to it on the end.  The camera button is somewhat pronounced so that's ok.  But the other end of the button is almost flush with the phone.  And they're the same button, but act like up down volume buttons.  The flush one is the first/on top so you feel for the camera button and push down just above that I guess.  Otherwise you wouldn't normally feel the other part.  The volume button is one solid pronounced button, you either push the top part of it or the lower part.  These should probably be like that, for ease of use.  I would have to use two hands so I wouldn't hit the camera button and because it's so low on the phone for a right handed person, it's hard to hold the phone and select especially without a cover that isn't slippery.  To me it's the \"short cut\" isn't any faster, and probably slower, to do than going into the menu, then to tools to select each feature. So, you're going into stuff to get there all the time.  Not liking that very much.  It's very much a basic phone.  No frills at all.  And it costs the same as the LG touch screen phone and my old Samsung slider.  That's why I was surprised at such a discrepency between the features on the phones and ease of use.  The slider part is a little wiggly when its closed and you're handling the phone.  Not very tight when it's closed.  I love Samsung, but I'm pretty disappointed in this phone.  I was sure it would be at least as good as the LG I lost or my old Samsung.  Not at all.  Obviously, others think it's great, and I'm not sure why.  Must be going back to the basics, sort of.  As I said before, I love Samsung phones and have been loyal to their brand whenever possible.  Until the LG, because it had the touch features for the same price as this one and included some other nice features such as swipe screen and etc.  Both have triple minutes, which is a must for me.  Hopefully all this blabbing provides some useful information for someone.
