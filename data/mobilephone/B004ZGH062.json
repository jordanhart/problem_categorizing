I ordered the new phone but it did not come in its original box, it does not look brand new, it did not come with the manual book for the phone, and it did not come with its original phone charger, the charger is different and only about 2 feet long, very short compared to normal chargers, its the cheap charger that they have for sell for $5, so I guess they take the nice one out of the box from your new phone and give you the cheap crappy charger so they can sell the other one for a better price, not sure. It did ship on the 4th of the 3 to 5 day business shipping days so that was good. So far the phone is working well but if I need another phone I will not be ordering it through Just Cellular, and I would advise others not to as well", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone is great", "Author": "AJ", "ReviewID": "RB3K11QYGY52U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone because my I was i need of a new one, and i wanted a touch. the phone its self is great and looked cool and lean. however this phone is a smart phone so you will need data to put in to use.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Didn't work", "Author": "jess.sargent", "ReviewID": "R3SKBB45QV8CG8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone didn't work and so I sent it back and got a full refund.

Its slow, it has nothing to offer, the touch screen is so off everything you do on it is frustrating. I pretty much went without a phone the entire 4 weeks I used this one.

However buyer beware it is considered a smartphone and requires a data package.. not just a texting one.. the sprint people at first told my daughter it didn't but they changed my plan to data so upon deeper investigation I found out that it was in fact a smartphone.. so as far as phones go it is a great buy for the money but only if you want a full data package.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "SUCKS!!!", "Author": "JessieLou", "ReviewID": "RUE2RH0Y71YZQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is the crappiest little phone I have ever had. It does not have a \"home\" screen with like a background picture. The camera SUCKS soo bad. You can't zoom, it has no flash, and it has this \"fuzzy picture warning\" that pops up everytime you go to take a picture that takes like 5 minutes to go away. You can only set an alarm for MON-FRI or Sat & Sun. You can't customize it to only go off on say a Wednesday only. For text messages the phone plays an ENTIRE ringtone, just like when you're getting a phone call. You can't mute the text messages without muting the ringtone. The phone makes an annoying ticking every time you hit a button if the volume is on, so to avoid it the volume has to always be off. You can only have 150 characters PER text message. So if you use more than that, unlike a normal phone, you have to send that message before you can finish what you are saying. Its ridiculous. It's the most technilogically unadvanced phone I've seen in a long time. The seller was great, got my package when I was supposed to with no issues. But the phone itself is crap. Wouldn't reccomend it to anyone.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung S30 SPH-M810 Instinct 2,", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "RI3MZW4RDJK0T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really like this phone.  easy to use. although not a smart phone does what I needed to do.
