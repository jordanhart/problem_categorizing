Combine that with free shipping and this is a really great deal for those who want a GSM phone that has a decent camera, is simple to use, and has a reasonably small form factor. I am using mine on the AT&T; network currently. I was previously using a Sony Ericsson W518a, which had been giving me a multitude of problems. I wanted a simple, unlocked phone that would work with my voice and text plan, but I didn't want to go backwards in camera resolution or expandable memory capabilities. Additionally, I did not want to renew my contract with an upgrade from AT&T; (Just in case I want to switch carriers in the near future). I don't have a data plan and pretty much only talk and text from my device. This phone does both very well. The reception and voice clarity are superior to that of my previous Sony Ericsson. The Nokia interface is not as aesthetically refined as the Sony Ericsson was, but it is simple and reliable. I will take functionality over beauty if I have to choose between the two. Some nice extras are the inclusion of a 3.5 mm audio jack and a micro USB port which can be used for charging and data transfers (I hate proprietary jacks!). The only problems I had were in configuring the MMS, Internet, and MEdia Net settings. Since this phone has never been sold by AT&T;, they won't provide any technical support. However, once I found some instructions for the configuration, it was easy to get all features running smoothly. This was a great buy.

The C2-01 is priced the same as some of Nokia's other smartphones that had a full keyboard (Blackberry style) but the C2-01 was the only one in-stock at the time. I wasn't expecting a whole lot after reading numerous reviews of other unlocked cellphones purchased via Amazon that yielded used/refurbished phones or phones that weren't unlocked.I was pleasantly surprised when the package arrived and my C2-01 was brand spanking new from the factory, complete with a NOKIA factory seal on the box. The battery was new, and the phone was in excellent condition. I was up and running within minutes, and fully charged the battery. I threw in a SIM card from another AT&T; phone and it was immediately working, no PIN or unlock requests, nothing. It immediately recognized the AT&T; SIM card and logged onto the network. I was unable to use the Internet or browse websites though, since I couldn't figure out how to change the access points properly. Even if I figured out how to access the internet, the C2-01 is ill-suited for browsing. The keypad is circa-2001 and the screen is circa-2001. It is very easy to use for phone calls and text messages (albeit slow due to the keypad design), and has MP3 audio capabilities.The micro-USB port allows you to charge the phone as well as access data. The AC adapter works in 120V AC and 240V AC outlets. A SIM card from China Unicom was inserted into the phone while in China, and it immediately recognized the carrier and changed the language to Chinese. The text and menu were in Chinese, this is great if you can read the language while traveling. But this is not so great when you can't read Chinese and just wanted a local prepaid SIM card to use while visiting! However, the simplicity and ease of use made the C2-01 truly worthwhile as a travel phone. The fact it can be used anywhere in the world (quad-band GSM and international 3G) makes it extremely versatile. The long battery life and simple interface for making/receiving phone calls are just icing on the cake!Overall: 4/5 stars. Antiquated keypad and tiny non-touch screen remind me of the late 1990s/early 2000s Nokia cellphones. The saving grace: long battery life, and automatic recognition of prepaid SIM cards makes for a perfect travel phone that can be used almost anywhere in the world.UPDATE: I figured out how to set it up for Internet access and as I suspected, the interface is ill-suited for web browsing let alone modern apps.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good reception", "Author": ".

I can't judge the battery life until i have had the phone for a year or so but everything else is ok.  the phone is smaller than i thought but i can live with that for now. camera takes good pictures, no flash, but you can edit photos so thats cool.  for people who want simple but good, this is the phone.update 3/12/12- i had the phone for over 6 months.  battery life is average, i do not surf the net or take many pictures and i still have to  charge the phone every 3 days, compared to a week or more when i first got it.  i definitely do not store messages or pictures because that just drains the battery faster.  pictures are ok and its easy to hook up the phone to my computer and transfer the pictures i take because you don't need to buy or download a special program to do it.  i would not buy this phone again, but would recommend it an older mom or dad or for a young teen (before they find out about social networking and smart phones).", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "Gregory \"Gregory\"", "ReviewID": "R3FL3TMXBUKDLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone as an upgrade from another Nokia phone.  Within minutes of opening the box, I had installed the battery and AT&T; SIM card, and it was up and running.Nokia phones are great.  Excellent reception, solidly built, simple and intuitive controls -- if you're already a Nokia user, there will be no learning curve with going to this phone.  The C2-01 has everything that I loved about my past Nokia phones, but with the added benefits of a good camera and a passable music player.  Also, there are some other notable improvements over past models, like the inclusion of a micro USB port (that can charge the phone from your computer), and a built-in FM radio.You shouldn't buy this phone if you're primarily interested in taking pictures or playing music.  It is, first and foremost, a phone.  But the little 3.2 MP camera does take some pretty good snapshots, and it will preserve memories that you would otherwise have lost because you left your camera at home.The music player is good but not great.  With its 3.5 mm headphone jack, the C2-01 will probably work with your existing headphones.  Songs can be organized by artist, genre, playlist, etc., and even album art is displayed.  It also comes equipped with an equalizer.  The only negative is that the sound quality, in my opinion, is not as good as an iPod or other similar player.Finally, the C2-01 comes with an external port for a micro SD chip (i.e., no having to take the back off the phone to insert it).  With an 8 GB chip, it will hold a substantial music collection and leave room for lots of pictures.I highly recommend this product -- it offers a great deal of quality and functionality for $75.00.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R2YNS0XKOWRQ6N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great!

If you spent 50 bucks a month for a data plan, obviously buy a proper smartphone.  The phone has a classic, nice look, but feels a little bit cheap-it's all plastic. You probably can't expect more for 80$. Good thing is, this makes it a very lightweight phone.The software is the result of a weird and long evolution. For example, you have at least 5 different places for shortcuts and menus (the normal menu, a short-cut bar, the home screen, the go-to menu, and you can put functions on the left- and right-button). All of these can be reconfigured, which means once you get used to it, you can access every commonly used feature with at most 2 clicks. The standard NOKIA theme is ugly, but the phone ships with an elegant dark theme. So far, it sometimes crashed while gaming, but otherwise it seems to be quite stable.  The games (Sudoku, a brain training thing, something like Tetris and a neat game of skill where you build skyscrapers) are not too exciting, so not really an issue. The phone is much faster than I was used to (had a 5+ year old NOKIA) and things happen almost instantly, except starting apps.Someone complained that synchronizing does not work with Mac OS, but  just google it, you can create an iSync plugin very easily (address book and calendar work nicely).  So overall, solid phone for everybody with a prepaid SIM card and without a data plan. If I could, I would trade the 3G and the camera for a better and thinner case. That phone would have gotten 5 stars easily.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Calls, music, and more + Easy SIM interchange, ...", "Author": "UT", "ReviewID": "R3RJQTGRTRUIDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a phone (i.e., a device basically for phone calls, as opposed to a hand-held computer).  I was pleasantly surprised by the Nokia C2-01, because the SIM from my old Motorola [originally a Cingular(!), then AT&T;, and finally a converted prepaid T-Mobile, after unlocking it] - anyway, taking the SIM out and placing it into the C2-01 was seamless/easy.Because my old phone was useless and the phonebook could not be retrieved, using the Nokia Ovi software (downloaded from their web site) made the process a little less painful - inputting the contacts from a keyboard is easier than doing so directly into the phone.  The Bluetooth wireless was then used to transfer the information from a laptop to the C2-01; I did not have a micro-USB interface cord, which would have been faster.  Also, I used Bluetooth to transfer about 1,000 songs from the same laptop via PC-based iTunes (downloaded from Apple) - for the money, its music function is great, as is the quality of calls.The Nokia C2-01 is more than adequate for anyone wanting a pre-paid phone that can be used in the USA or Europe.  Otherwise, if one wants additonal services from either AT&T; or T-Mobile - that will run more $'s, of course.  I only wanted a conversation phone, but the additional functions of the C2-01 are welcome, although I am not making full use of them.The display is very readable; the menu system is just fine for a better-than-basic phone; calls are clear.  The buttons are easy to use and accurate.  I chose the \"warm silver\" color - it seemed like a \"brighter\" choice to me than black.From Amazon, I also ordered a side pouch belt case by BestCellBuy [Amazon had this on sale for $0.99(!)]; and a protective gel skin by iTALKonline - fits perfectly with little additional girth.I am quite satisfied with the Nokia C2-01; and with Amazon's product selection and shipping/handling service - free shipping and no sales tax (Woohoo!).See this link:  Nokia C2-01 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Music and Video Player--U.S. Version with Warranty (Warm Silver)", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "does the job right...", "Author": "R.

Great memory expansion and it does work with AT&T; and T-mobile.----------LONG review: I found this one, order it and arrived sooner than expected, charged the battery and inserted SIM and made some calls and texts to try out, it works super no problems UNTIL I got to play and explore it more some days later; the settings are not hard to get but just takes times to figure out. It has some apps (facebook, email, nokia store etc...) that you can use but I don't need them so I'll skip that. Thou you can find the same items in the Gallery and Media menus it gets annoying because you don't need to have different locations for the same things could same the space and relocated into one.The MINUS ONE STAR, I am disappointed in three things that I found messed up after I got to explore this phone more; 1.) the alarm clock is only for one time and can't set it for different wake-ups all other tools I found were OK. 2.) can't get media message (pictures) on this phone so far I can browse the net but can't receive/send pics like my previous phone 3.) my carrier charged me for the data that was used for the free game i downloaded from the nokia store since I was not aware the phone would be using data while playing the game, that was my fault so I just set that to DO NOT ALLOW anymore and now I can play without having the phone use up data. I don't have a data plan to begin with.It is plastic and you DO NEED to protect it, I got a protective case and so far I have drop it more than once till this day it works nice, NO DROP CALLS so far.

My iPhone 3GS had been dropped on its head one too many times and I knew it was not long for this world. Not wanting to have it die on me and be rushed in to a purchase (my cell is my only phone), I decided to research some simple phones and found that this one got the best reviews on many sites when compared to others in this price range. Where I live I only get good reception from AT&T; and I wanted a pre-paid plan. Most if not all of the GoPhones (while cheaper) got poor reviews for sound quality and construction. Mind you, I was just wanting a phone to talk on and I did not plan to text, check email, or use any type of data at all, so this was a good choice for me. I have read that folks who want to use the data features have run into trouble when trying to connect, but I can not speak personally on this issue.I have only had it for about a three days, but so far, so good. To get it up and running I charged it, took the sim out of the iPhone, and put it in the Nokia. I immediately got a signal and all I had to do was spend a frustrating hour on the phone with AT&T; migrating to a pre-paid plan (my choice- I could have just dropped the data plan and kept my post-paid acct, obviously).  Since that first charge the battery icon shows only one less \"bar\" than full, and I have had it on the entire time. I like the look, size, and feel of the phone. The sound quality is good and I find the user interface simple to navigate.  It came with plenty of ring tones and the simple one I chose is nice and loud so if I leave it on the table near a window I can hear it when I'm out working in the yard. Someone else mentioned that there is no dedicated button for volume control, but I knew that ahead of time and I have not found it to be a problem. It's just a few key presses to put it in \"silent\" mode for theatres, meetings and such, so no worries.I will say that when I tried to copy my contacts from sim to phone, it said my sim was empty. I don't honestly know if this was because the contacts data was in some smart-phoney format that my new dumb phone could not read, but I really don't care all that much. I had actually begun to worry that I didn't memorize anyone's phone number anymore because all I ever had to do was touch their name... I had gotten very iLazy. Indeed-- when asked recently I could not recite my own son's phone number! I consider that I am doing my brain a favor. Of course I could enter them manually, and it is possible to sync contacts, music, etc via Windows (or Mac with an iSync plug in) but I have not tried this and am not likely to any time soon. My old iPhone is now my new iPod touch that stores all my music as it always has, and I have gone back to memorizing phone numbers (starting with my son's).In conclusion, if you are looking for just a phone without a lot of bells and whistles, I recommend this device.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Old Nokia", "Author": "BittenAgain", "ReviewID": "R249OOQLPWKA0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works well as it has always been the case with Nokia products.

The predictive text works pretty well for typing with only 10 keys.Media player - You can load MP3s on this phone and play them through the included earphones.  It also plays FM radio.  You can also select MP3s as ring tones.Charging - Charging can be done using the included adapter or through the micro USB cable.Compatibility - I use T-Mobile pre paid.  I put my SIM card in, and the phone worked right away.  It will not send pictures, but I have read that you can contact T-Mobile to enable picture send if you want it.  Since pictures cost $.25 each to send, I choose to keep this feature disabled and upload any pictures directly to my PC.Nokia Suite software - This is my only complaint about this phone.  This software is confusing and difficult to use.  It will allow you to put some extra games on the phone, but many of the games will not work without a data plan.  Downloading music and backing up the phone is not intuitive.  The software needs a Windows Explorer type interface to show you exactly what is on the phone, and it needs a simple copy & paste feature.

Frantz", "ReviewID": "R39X5HL0EDQUJ0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nokia C2-01.5 is a pretty basic phone when compared to the plethora of smart phones on the market. It's also quite good as a basic phone.Cons: The interface is simplistic, and lacking in many regards. It's not a good phone for frequently sending text messages, though I don't use it for texts so that wasn't a concern. It's a bit too light weight and small, and slippery to hold. Importing contacts was a bit annoying, and I ended up importing them into Outlook to mate with the Nokia software, but it does sync with Outlook for calendar and contacts as well as with some free email software options. There's no wifi, though I doubt many people will be using this phone for surfing the web, but that means the 3G is mostly useless because if you wanted to pay $30 a month for a data plan you probably wouldn't be looking at this phone.Pros: It gets a solid signal. My connection is better now than possibly any phone I've used on Verizon or ATT, including the iphone 3gs, blackberry bold 9000, and droid x(1). It's clear enough for voice, especially considering the price point, but nothing to brag about. It's international ready, and works very well for me on ATT. Bluetooth connects quickly. Battery life is exceptional compared to a smart phone and many basic phones of past; you will immediately notice that you're free of carrying around a charger all day if you use it as just a phone. The price is fair. It can be charged off a USB (not included) or wall charger, and accepts a micro-SD card if you need the storage. It uses a standard headphone jack for audio, including FM radio, so there's no need to have a proprietary connector. It can sync to a computer using bluetooth.Overall: If you're looking to use this phone for the 3g data, you'll probably be disappointed. It would be better to purchase a used smartphone of ebay/craigslist. If you text a lot, this is probably not the phone for you.

After a lot of searching, I came across the Nokia C2-01.5. I didn't want another smartphone as a backup due to costs; I just wanted something capable of sending/receiving calls, texts and mms as well as having MicroUSB charging support so I could continue to use my other phone chargers (I have about 6 of them). For the price, this phone fit the bill and also had the added bonus of 3G (HSDPA) support on ATT's network.I picked up one of the \"Used - Like New\" items for a discount. The phone came in mint condition with all the accessories and manuals. It powered on and worked great, however there is one small annoyance (one that I suppose I could get used to) - the screen itself is skewed about 10-15 degrees to the right, so it's essentially \"crooked\" when powered on and held normally. This doesn't affect any of the functionality of the phone, but it looks really strange and makes you do a \"double take\" when looking at the phone and using it. Because of this obvious build quality issue, I couldn't give it more than 3 stars.As far as signal strength and other features, this phone does as advertised. Pictures aren't anything fantastic and the screen (as well as the phone itself) is very small, although perfectly functional.

The decade-old navigation habits work just like they always have, while new features are intuitive and simple use.  The Opera Mini browser is too small to be useful, but it works in an absolute pinch.For GPRS/Internet connectivity, I followed the simple AT&T; instructions for Nokia S40 located here:att.com/learningcenter/tutorials.do?tutorialId=763520&_requestid=620564#fbid=hbp8i4LW5ByThese instructions were much simpler than those posted in the top-rated review.For contacts, I got all my Google contacts to automatically sync following the simple instructions located here:support.google.com/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&topic;=15015&answer;=98265The one feature this phone is missing is a GPS and the ability to run Google Maps.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "poor interface, compatibility", "Author": "Phil Loubere", "ReviewID": "R18OBAT4VYWBPS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm on page 51 of the manual trying to look for a shortcut for a silent setting, and one to set it back to normal. An intuitive interface would have put these basic functions in an obvious place, but I had to flip through 51 pages to find out that if I want that functionality, I have to set up my own shortcuts. Other things, like locking the keypad - which is essential on this phone - are also arcane: push the menu button, then star. If you're not familiar with Nokia devices, it's a combination you'd take a long time figuring out on your own.What these indicate is that interface design is typically an afterthought instead of a prime consideration. This is why the iPhone is so popular - they started with the interface and designed the device around that. At Nokia, they do that in reverse order.So, in spite of the nice range of functions in such an inexpensive phone, I give it minus points for that. Camera, facebook, IM and internet all have icons on the home screen, but completing tasks with them can also get confusing.The other disappointment with this device is its lack of compatibility - not only with Macs, but even with Windows XP Pro if it's 64 bit. So it doesn't work with the two OS's I happen to use.As another reviewer pointed out, it would be great if Nokia would just focus on a handful of devices and made those really good, instead of the hundred or so models they produce.
