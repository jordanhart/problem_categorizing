The phones works great and it was registered with straight talk like it was supposed to be. It actually got here a week from the day I ordered it. There was a chip on the bottom right hand corner when i got it but it's not too bad. It would have been nice to know beforehand. The only major problem is that one of the speakers is broken. The sound is still really good, like it plays twice as loud out of the working speaker, so it doesn't really bother me. The phone was supposed to be refurbished though so nothing should be messed up.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Michael Scott Maxwell", "ReviewID": "R38BOII6SUQZ5B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having had a few concussions, my memory isn't exactly great so my TBI doctor recommended I get a smart phone to help me remember my appointments on the calendar function. this has been a great help as well and may of the other gadgets and stuff I am figuring out with the phone as well. I avoided the smart phone band wagon for quite a bit now and am happy to have this as my first smart phone.
