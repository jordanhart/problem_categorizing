{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good 4G LTE Phone, But....", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "ROO9SI2YXQOZE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG F3 is one of the best small, light 4G LTE phones on the market.  However, Sprint contract customers are offered several better phones at the price of one penny, including the LG Optimus G. For one hundred dollars more, contract customers are offered phones that are vastly superior to the F3 that will have $200 trade-in value two years from now.The LG F3 truly shines in the pre-paid, off-contract market where it sells for $99 to $200 at MetroPcs, T-Mobile, and Virgin Mobile.So, while the LG F3 is a very good 4G LTE phone, contract customers are paying premium prices and should select premium phones such as the LG Optimus G that will have good trade-in and resale value two years from now.  The F3 is a good buy ONLY off-contract.", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Basic Phone except for the small memory", "Author": "D", "ReviewID": "R1EPO0SGBTUW4C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: Runs fast, nice clean interfaceCons: Very little internal memory-- cannot install apps to external memory card (unless you root the phone).Overall: I would give this phone 5 stars if it had more internal memory and/or allowed apps to be installed on the SD card.If you don't need to install hardly any apps, this is a wonderful Android phone. If you are the type who installs alot of apps/games, then I would not recommend this one.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ECJ5WHG"}}
