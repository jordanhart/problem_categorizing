{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A One-of-a-kind Phone", "Author": "Ryan Myers", "ReviewID": "R3R7MIUHJ4WEJQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is better than what I thought it was going to be before I got it, but it is important that I point out some things be fore someone goes and buys it.First, the camera is advertised to have a 13 megapixel camera whereas it really only has a 5 megapixel camera (this didn't bother me much since I hardly ever use phone cameras, but for those of you who do, you have been warned.)Second, I have had some trouble charging this phone. Its battery life is amazing, but it sometimes rejects a wall charger if the battery is at 60% charge or less. Anything more than that is fine. Every time I have plugged the phone into my computer, though, it charges perfectly no matter the phone's battery level. In other words, plugging the phone into a computer to charge is best.Third, even though this phone may be a Samsung Galaxy S4 clone, IT WILL NOT BE RECOGNIZED BY SAMSUNG KIES.Fourth, (for those of you who may be concerned) when sliding between the phone's home screens it is noticeably choppy. Transitions between pages and screens on any other part of the phone are smooth ,however.Besides these differences, overall I think this phone is a great investment. It is WAY cheaper than the S4, and it has tons of great features. Its performance for gaming is very agreeable and its battery life even more so. Oh, and If you're wondering if the phone really does come with JellyBean 4.2.2, well, it does. :)", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "good for the money", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "RMOPVJN46S7ID", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good phone for the money. the only downside for me is the audio. the mic is not sensitive enough and the speaker is not too loud. the led flash is not bright, but considering what you pay and the other futures of the phone, i would give it 4 stars.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D54H54W"}}
