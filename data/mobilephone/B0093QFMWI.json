It has a SONY logo on it. AND Android 4.0.4 on it.The device itself is awesome. I had it as a replacement for my iPhone 3Gs. I also had the iPhone 5 for a week before I return it for some financial issues. I gotta say, this beats the hell out of the iPhone. I am not saying that I didn't enjoy using my iPhone, but eventually, the simplicity of it made it very boring. Android is very customisable. It has several down points like not having a built-in dictionary, email accounts are refusing to be registered, and others. However, that does not make me regret switching.The phone is incredibly FAST. The screen is astonishingly clear, sharp and colourful. All apps you had on the iPhone you will find them on the Play Market of Android.One more thing I actually HATE about the phone; the four touch buttons in the front. They don't respond as they suppose to. Maybe I am just not used to using them though. Their functions are logic and facilitating.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "sexiest phone I ever had..............", "Author": "joseM", "ReviewID": "R2MURACAQO1JXK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best phone I ever had, super fast, sexy , get a lot of compliments on looks alone, had it for a month and works great on T-MOBILE network, great reception everywhere, cant wait to get JELLY BEAN update, i would recommend it to any T-MOBILE costumer who wants a fast and sexy phone.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$699.99", "Features": "View and share your pictures or HD videos in crisp and vibrant colors on the stunning 4.6-Inch 1080p HD Reality Display powered by Mobile BRAVIA Engine.\nEasily share all your photos and videos on a larger HD TV screen.
