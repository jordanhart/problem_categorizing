{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Horrible quality, do not buy", "Author": "Howard A.", "ReviewID": "R2CXUH0C03UKGN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this less than 4 months ago, but more than 90 days ago.I just began to have a problem that  others have reported online(a white screen, so you can't see anything, but the phone works).Motorola only gives it a 90 day warranty and wants to charge me $110 to fix it.Others have had similar problems as well. I paid $185 for the phone and expect it to work more than 90 days, and not to be charged as much to repair as it would cost to buy new now.Buyer beware when buying Motorola, poor quality, almost non existent warranty, and poor customer support. I will never buy another Motorola product and will recommend against it for others.", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Nationwide Walkie-Talkie\nStereo Bluetooth enabled\nMultimedia and text messaging features\nMusic player with standard audio input\nmicroSD card slot", "Name": "Boost Mobile Motorola Debut I856w (Woman) White Prepaid Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41cOYzatABL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002XW6HBE"}}
