The main problem I have run into is the touch screen does not work after 2-3 months into it on top of a dimmed screen light and not disconnecting calls.  I have contacted the seller, emailed them back and forth on the problems with no help at all. Finally, they asked me to seek a local help on this phone and now I am stuck with an unfunctional phone. Not cool at all.  I would not recommand anyone to buy from this vendor at all.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its a good phone for the price", "Author": "Just_ an_average_customer", "ReviewID": "RTEF49JKKJSC9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is well made. The screen doesn't lag when you swipe. The only reason why i gave the phone a 4 star raiting was because when i got the phone and opened it, i saw a slot that had a s-pen (if that's what it's called). When i took it out and tried to use it on the screen it wasn't working. So i realized that it was fake. Which really upsetted me. Another reason why i gave it a four star raiting was that in the description it said that the phone had a 8mp camera. When i checked the camera out it was HORRIBLE. Every thing was horrible and the picture didn't come out good. The front facing camera is just as bad. If you want a phone that will take amazing pictures this might not be one of your choices.PROS-----------Big screen good for watching moviesLoud volumeFast wifiCONS----------Horrible cameraFake s penHard to find casses** I bought a galaxy note 2 case for this phone and it actually fit really good**", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "awesome", "Author": "cactus", "ReviewID": "R28KBTNN8BNJPX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am fully satisfied.
