The seller responded well to my questions, and was fast shipping. I put my full size sim card in it from At&T; go phone, and it works good for phone calls.  I do not have a data plan so have just used wifi.After owning this a couple months I would recommend this product.  Works great!

I had never heard of a \"phablet\" before finding this one. What do you get a teenager who has everything??? A tablet/phone that has everything! I ssearched, researched, over and over again and again. I settled on this because of all the features it comes with. I purchased it & had it forwarded to her. She's very tech savvy & put her T-Mobile sim card, her SD card & set up her wifi in a matter of minutes. She absolutely loves it!!! The seller is wonderful, she received it 2 days early. I left part of the address off by mistake, I emailed them & within minutes they got back to me & said they would resend it as soon as it was returned. Thank goodness I spoke with the post office & they re-delivered to the correct address. Also she had a problem with her charger, I contacted the seller, they sent out a new one to her without question. Great seller and product!", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "5 Star Product", "Author": "Raycard M. R.

The calling and the text messaging worked but the data would not (unless using Wi-Fi, in which case it worked flawlessly).  If the data worked then I would have definitely kept the Phablet but the main reason I bought it was to have a bigger screen for Netflix.  The reason I gave it 5 stars is because Indigi's customer service made everything so easy and they even waived the restocking fee. Thank you Indigi.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "it needs improvement", "Author": "Lacara Hickman", "ReviewID": "R2DT00WYZDLJ26", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Battery life sucks!!!

Not happy that it was not able to pick up the sim card for at and t since it was supposed to be unlocked. Tried several times and I became frustrated with it since that was my primary reason for buying it. So don't buy it if you are thinking of using it with the at and t 3g sim card. I  contacted the seller and was told to return it because something might be wrong with it. I was told that I  would be reimbursed the shipping fees on exchange for the other one. At this point  I did return it but customer service was a bit slow with them. When I decided to actually return the item I was credited the amount for the item and restocking fee was waived. Which I didn't know there was one and not reimbursed the shipping fees. So in the end through this experience I would say be careful when it sounds too good to be true. Don't buy it because if it truly was unlocked it should have worked right away.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "Barbara W.", "ReviewID": "RPGFF4FGYU3UR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it !!!
