{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good entry level android phone", "Author": "S", "ReviewID": "R3OVDJIMRGEK2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a blackberry user for the past few years. I have had the bold 9000, torch 9810 and bold 9900. With all the hype about the android os, I decided to give it a try. I did not want to spend a lot of money on a galaxy or any of the expensive sets since I wasn't sure if I would like the os. While researching, I came across this phone and purchased it from OG Wireless.It arrived in a small box (original packaging) with the handset, charger and battery. I slipped in my sim and sd card and after downloading the configuration settings for my carrier, I was up and running. I tried calls and the quality is good. It connected to my home wifi with no problem and so far I have not been disappointed. Please bear in mind I am experimenting with android and have no knowledge of the system.I downloaded several apps from google play (after entering my gmail account info) and again encountered no problem. There is tabbed browsing which I like. It came preloaded with a ton of apps that I will have to sort through to figure out their usefulness. These include YouTube, google talk, google plus, email, samsung apps etc.The sleep/power button is on the right hand side, volume button on the left, earphone jack at the top. The back comes off with a little effort. I had to use a small nail file to prise it up.Whew! All in all, I have not been disappointed SO FAR. I am still getting used to the android os but the interface is very user friendly. Long and short, I have no hesitation recommending this phone if you want a cheap, basic android phone without the bells and whistles.Will update as time progresses.UPDATE 10/11/12 Battery life so far has been good. At 9 am the phone was 100% charged. After Wifi was on all day and chatting all day it is at 75% (9:57 pm). I should point out that I surfed for a bit and also used other apps but minimally. I primarily chatted. The phone has a covered micro or mini USB port at the top for charging and seemingly any charger with that end works. I tried it with my kindle and Bb chargers without problem.Concerning the preinstalled app, they apparently cannot be deleted. Oh joy lol but it's ok. So far I am still not disappointed. May upgrade later but it works fine for me for now. Wil update if necessary.", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Such a Deal that I Feel Like I Stole It", "Author": "Fly By Light", "ReviewID": "R59RBQ1F95TI9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After checking out Unlocked Cellphone Kings on ebay and BBB (excellent ratings on both), I took the plunge.  The phone shipped quickly, and arrived in discrete packaging (Return address did not mention cell phones - good thinking!).  Contents:  phone, battery, charger (not US), adapter, quick start guide in English, and three manuals, none in English.  Setup was simple, quick and painless.  However, I don't have a data plan, so I worried about how to avoid unconscionable charges for accidental downloads.  The surprisingly hard-to-find .pdf manual in English (found at [...]-downloads) was very helpful with that and several other important issues (How do I answer the phone?  How do I hang up?  . . . )  After getting oriented, I discovered that this phone is jam-packed.  It compares pretty favorably with my kids twice-as-expensive Samsung Exhibit.  It has Gingerbread and works great with Google apps like Google Play and Google Drive.  It even has a hidden micro SD slot inside and GPS.Nothing's perfect and this is no exception.  First, I had some problems with Amazon's Android Appstore.  One Yahtzee clone and the store itself are glitchy.  Second, the phone is really tiny.  It makes reading and some apps tricky, but the keyboard is not hard to use.  It's only 3G, which is not a problem for me.  Some apps require earbuds, rather than the speaker (which is an observation, not a complaint).  And the battery life is nowhere near what is advertised, especially if you turn on networking, GPS, WiFi, . . .  None of these is a big problem - this is a tight, impressive little device and for just over $100, it's really kind of shocking how much you can do with it.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone is good but international model is causing issues", "Author": "Rachel Williams \"Rachel and Family\"", "ReviewID": "R2SV13PBOX572C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like this phone, its for my 13 year old son.  Everything works great except one thing.  The Access Point Settings needed set up to allow the data network for T-Mobile.  Internet was then working fine.  But everytime I change the MNC setting to 260 for T Mobile it wipes out all the other settings.  I was told my T-Mobile and Samsung that neither can help me because this is an international phone.  So basically now we cannot use MMS (picture messaging) on this phone.  THis is a big deal for him and if I knew this I would not have purchased it.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Android will kill the feature phone with this little gem", "Author": "SunyJim", "ReviewID": "R18TPXLE6FQD7Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is not a North American phone, they are sold in UK, Germany, India, Hong Kong.The phone is multiband GSM so works with GSM carriers (Rogers and Fido in Canada, T-Mobile and some others in USA)I bought this to replace a simple flip phone, that I use as a phone and sometimes to text. It's small, battery is good, screen is way bigger than my old KRZR K1, so I'm really happy. Wi-fi is fantastic bonus for Facebook, email, google messenger, etc when i'm at home or at the coffee shop. GPS works great. Phone is fast and very responsive. Camera is just 2MP fixed focus, but takes good enough point and shoot pictures.If you are buying this for data, keep in mind it will do EDGE, but not 3G, this is a foreign market the 3G is HSDPA 900 / 2100. It uses different frequencies than North America for 3G (hardware based, not changeable) so that doesn't work here.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unlocked Samsung world phone", "Author": "Rosewood", "ReviewID": "R27BAHP3ZAU1A3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone, it came on time and works perfectly.

The phone has an elegant design, it's easy to use, it is very light and nice. One thing that both my husband and I have a problem with is the sound gallery, in all honesty the ringtones are all a little weird. The other one is the charger - the charger in itself seems ok, but I've had problems problems with the travel adapter which looks very cheap. It simply refuses to make proper contact. Fortunately, my Kindle charger works with the phone, so I solved the problem. And at least we know that when I go to Europe, we will have a charger for my phone and my Kindle:)Anyway, I recommend the phone.

A. Miller", "ReviewID": "R219P1RLUVFEOW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Some have said this is a good starter phone for a teen. I'm old enough to be the father of these teens, but it does everything I want it to. I like the small size. It slides nicely into my jeans pocket. Overall, I'm pleased with it.I saw from other ratings that people got phones in languages other than English. I spent a few more dollars and ordered directly from Amazon to avoid that problem. The packaging came with a recycle bag to ship my old phone for free anywhere in Australia. The date on the phone is in day-month format and apparently can't be changed. But someone knew he was shipping to an American, because the recharger came with an adapter for an American plug. I'm satisfied with that. (As an aside, this works out for me, because I will most likely use the phone in Australia, and now I don't have to buy an adapter.)Some have complained about needing to double-tap to reach the keypad. The actual sequence is: 1) tap the power button to activate the screen, 2) tap twice to unlock it, 3) tap to select the key pad. This is a little bit of a nuisance, and the biggest reason I took off a star. However, after a few days of using the phone, it has almost become habit.The smaller screen size makes the keys a little hard to hit, too, but I never did a lot of texting to begin with. I think I'll get the hang of it with a little practice. I haven't learned to swipe yet.The camera seems adequate but I'll need to see more photos to know for sure.In short, the phone does what I need it to: minimal calling and texting, with some occasional photos, with the capability for international use. If I wanted it to do more, I'd get a more expensive phone.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Entry Level Phone", "Author": "Beabea", "ReviewID": "R3RNEHHI1NZI6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is about 4 inches by 2.5 inches with a screen that is around 2.75 inches diagonally.  Compared to the expensive phones, this seems pretty small.  That said, for around one hundred fifteen dollars, it is a good value.  I have T-Mobile and broke my previous phone.  I inserted my SIM card into this phone and it works fine.  I live in the US.  The charger is made for some European standard, but it came with an Adapter so it can fit into a US outlet.  The camera is 2MP which is fine for taking the occasional cell phone photo.  It also has GPS and a FM radio.  Overall, for the price this is a good value.

I downloaded kindle so i can read books on my phone wherever i go. The phone is just the right size, not too big or small.Update on the Phone: Bought this phone in January and in the month of May the phone started giving trouble. User fault not kernel panic upload mode and *#9900# came up on the phone and the same problem keep on occurring or the android man will be on the screen and only when i take out the battery and restart the phone it will go away. The phone doesn't stay on so i miss all my important calls and messages. I contacted the seller they recommended something and it didn't work, i told them that and they never responded only to return a week after and tell me that i have passed the 30 day return policy so the phone cannot be returned and to contact Samsung. I know definitely i wouldn't be buying anything from this seller again.2nd Update  An Amazon representative helped me file the A to Z guarantee claim and it took 2 weeks for the guarantee support team to inform me that my claim has been denied and to file an appeal which was also denied. If this was there policy why did the representative help me file the claim? The reason it was denied was because i did not contact the seller within 14 days of receipt to report the issue or return the item within 30 days of receipt. I received the phone 30th January 2013  and it started to give trouble in May 2013 so i don't  know how i can send it back 14 days after receiving it when it started to give trouble 4 months after receiving it.
