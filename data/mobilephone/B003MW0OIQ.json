{"Reviews": [{"Title": "simplicity manifested through gophone", "Author": "Leandro Creatini", "ReviewID": "RA8XX1X4ZCBQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've just bought this phone over the past weekend at BB for $15 and bought $25 airtime.Service:So far, I have to say I am quite happy with it.  I previously had T-Mobile prepaid but had to switch because I had no service in my house.  After switching to AT&T;, I can actually make calls/texts in my house.  The service is quite cheap as well, I am on the Simple Rate plan.  It costs $.10/min to talk which gets deducted from your prepaid balance.  Standard texting costs $.25 per text, but I bought 200 messages for $4.99 that lasts for 30 days (Comes to $.02/text).Cell Phone:The phone was super cheap and yet it is quiet sturdy.  There is no exterior screen, making it that much more stable/energy efficient.  It is quite possibly the simplest phone you can buy new on the market.  It does not have the capacitive touchscreen that you will find on an iPhone, it does not have an HD screen, nor does it let you scroll through the internet like you would on your computer.  Instead, this phone lets you make calls and send/receive text messages.  Crazy right?  It is not made to be the shiny object that attracts the nearby fishes and sheep, it is simply a mobile phone for communicating.  My only quip is that is has no volume control buttons on the side, not a huge issue, just something I would have liked.  I also use the phone as my alarm to wake up.Final Word:I estimate that it will cost me about $10-15 a month for their service a month.  I usually text a lot more than I make calls, but I spend no more than 100-150 minutes a month which equals $10-15.  Now that I have the $4.99 texting package, I will probably reduce my minutes, making it go down to 50-10 minutes.  The phone serves is purpose, I am very satisfied with it.  I'd give it 5 stars if it had a volume control button the side, it doesn't so I'll live without it but it is not perfect.  It meets all my criteria of needs, nothing else to say.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "A solution-painless replacement of a lost phone on a family plan", "Author": "G.

The phone, which my wife did not like much anyway, was on my family plan. My wife prefers clamshell phones so my plan to pass her down my IPhone 3GS was not met with any enthusiasm. So how did I get her a new cellphone, one she likes, put it on the plan, and not extend my plan by another two years?This phone is the answer. First it's a clamshell. Second it is priced right. Third, AT&T; will put in a new SIM card for her family plan number. Finally none of this extends my existing plan should I want to switch providers (and I am not sure I do since AT&T; is getting better).Now please note that by installing a new SIM card, this becomes a regular cellphone on my plan. It is no longer a prepaid phone.The voice quality is quite good. It has a camera, which my wife is unlikely ever to use. It has what it calls \"Apps\" was are a few limited and unimaginative mini-programs. It can text, another feature my wife won't use, and has a means to download a few MP3s.An iPhone it's not.

The \"Product Description\" says it includes $15 of airtime.  When I didn't see the $15 in my account after activation I called AT&T;, who said this phone does not include any airtime.  I then called Amazon who confirmed the $15 airtime claim, but the Amazon rep told me I had to contact Samsung.  Unfortunately, the number she gave me was for directory assistance.....I had to call India (I mean Amazon) back.  Samsung said I had to deal with either Amazon or AT&T.;I have since sent an inquiry to Amazon via email and will update this review.Sounds like someone is lying on the Amazon website.Update.....I just talked with Amazon who said they will give me $15 credit for future Amazon purchases, and will update the product description.  When I asked why the 1st rep didn't offer the same solution, which would've saved me an hour of calling (and being on hold), he basically said that that was Amazon's policy and wanted the customer to exhaust all avenues.

As such, I expect she will use the phone for a few days every couple of months.The payment plans available are extremely unfriendly for this purpose.  All of the available plans are \"use it or lose it\" - minimum deposit is $15 monthly or $25 that expires in 3 months.  When the billing period is up, AT&T; eats all your unspent funds and you have to pump more into the account in order to use the phone again.  There is NO option for people who want to pay only for time used.I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by this, but the ATT reps are apparently coached to be dishonest when setting up the plans as well.  I asked the rep I spoke with at least 3 times if there were any hidden fees or monthly minimums, and she said \"no\" three times.

Most importantly, the phone I purchased started to shut off by itself after a few months causing me to miss incoming calls and texts. Then, even when it was on, texts sent to me in the morning would show up late in the day, as would voice mail messages and missed call indicators.I ended up replacing the phone and all of these problems disappeared so I can't seem to fault my network provider. Again, $9.99 is not a lot to pay for a phone, but making and receiving calls when I wish is not a lot to expect from a cellular device at any price.

I have tried more expensive phones, but this one is just right because I like a simple cell phone with internet capabilities.  I love its almost only text browsing.

Usually, I spend about $25 on it every month, but if there is a $15 card, I can get away with spending that much.  A 100MB package should do it for the first month, and then with rollover, you can buy less expensive internet packages.  It is almost impossible to use up 100MB on this phone, and I use my internet daily for hours on end.Sometimes my hands are shaky, and that makes typing on one of those mini-keypads on the more expensive phones nearly impossible for me.  Not only that, this phone fits in my hands well.  That is, when I use other phones for hours on end, my thumbs hurt.  However, with this phone, there is no pain.

Sad to say, this little phone has better call quality than the one it replaced. If you're looking for a calls-only, absolutely no-bells-and-whistles phone just for emergencies, you can wind up spending a lot more money for far worse phones than this one. It'll also fit into the watch pocket of your jeans, which for me was actually important.The one downside is that if you want to put a game on a phone to pass time on the bus or subway, you need to pick a different device. I went to the AT&T; site, found exactly three games I was told were compatible for this device, bought one, and then found out that it wasn't compatible at all - leading me to spend far more time with AT&T; customer service recovering the cost of the game than the time was worth. I let a more knowledgeable friend of mine mess around with the phone only to learn that there is apparently no game or app which this phone can host. As such, I repeat my earlier use of the phrase \"NO bells and whistles\" - you can't even BUY any for this device. Calls and texts, that's about all you can hope for (the phone does feature predictive texting).Features I really liked were that the phone has Spanish AND French language settings (I far too often see only Spanish offered as an alternative to English) and the fact that one of the default ringtones is the \"classic ring\" - which means that when it rings, it sounds like a real telephone instead of a high-tech torture device. This is a tremendous plus, because almost all of the other default tones are intolerable.One other thing: you can put pictures on the phone (note: it has no camera of its own) to use as wallpaper if you know how, but the screen quality is so low that if you're using a picture of Michelle Pfeiffer it may well come out looking like Joan Rivers. So not only can you not put a game on it, but it isn't even worth the trouble to try to personalize the phone at all.I give it three and a half stars, which I've rounded up to four, because it delivers a lot for pretty much the lowest price you can pay for a new cell phone these days. I'd have given it four and a half rounded up to five if I could have put so much as one lousy game on it.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Rip-off alert!

(Please add a comment if you come across anything@)TIP: If you don't want to get charged for Internet usage ever, call up AT&T;, get a Customer Service Agent and tell them you want to block all data/Internet access.  They'll warn you that this will also disable MMS (Picture/sound/video messaging) but since you can't send such messages anyway, this is probably not a big deal.  **Now I don't have to worry about being charged every time I press the wrong button and it starts.**  I use my Verizon MiFi with my MacBook Pro, iPod or iPad for mobile 'net access.Service:I recommend the $2/day plan.  You can use this as a backup phone - make most of your calls from anywhere over the Internet (via wireless hotspot and iPod touch, smartphone with WiFi - e.g. most Android, iOS or Symbian phones.)  It's best to use with Google Voice ; my GV # is my main phone # that I give out.  If the 'net connection isn't on, this lets me know if anyone calls, or texts, and then I can take the call on this phone or on another device.  Texting from an iPad is a GREAT experience compared to any cellphone.Cell Phone:The phone very cheap and yet it is quite sturdy.  It's about the simplest phone you can buy. This phone just lets you make calls and send/receive text messages, plus a few tools like alarms and calculators. No headset jack, volume controls, camera, crash-prone operating system,  No time-sucking learning curve.Final Word:I generally don't use more than $25 per 3 months.  Plus, you can buy $25 cards at a discount if you shop around. The phone serves my needs and I am very satisfied with it.

The quick keys and navigation to get to your text area or your messaging center are cumbersome.  You may be thinking, 'but it's an inexpensive phone?  What do you want?\"  Well, I'm glad you asked.  The main (and most frustrating) aspect of this phone is that if you do not hold the mouth piece directly in front of your mouth, the other person listening on the other end will not be able to hear you.  Even if I hold the end of the phone near my chin, there's massive fade out.  So, if you get this phone, you'd better be mechanical in how you hold it.
