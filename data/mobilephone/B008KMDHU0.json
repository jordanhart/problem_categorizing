Previous phone was lost in Togo Africa! Seller is great, no problems. The only reason I am writing this is to provide info that some may not be aware of. This phone is an international version. So it is not a 4G network phone but it will accept all other network types. In a way, this a good thing as I have seen other 4G users have many problems in several African countries. I still find the network plenty fast and I use my phone to provide a wifi hotspot so I can use my laptop.The other item I would like to add is concerning battery life. Some may have noticed that thier batteries do not last too long even though they turn off Bluetooth, GPS and other features, but I think many are not aware that programs running the phone can have a dramatic affect on battery life. If hold down the home button, it will go to the screen that shows all your applications and the option to stop them. It also has clear ram feature.

When it had arrived I have noticed that there is a small space between touchscreen glass and body of the phone (about 0.5 mm) from both sides. Also plastic back cover was not closed properly. I have put small pressure from the sides of the phone and those spaces have gone. A moment after that I put my Otterbox cover on the phone and did not remove it till this month. I was mistakenly sure that the issue with the spaces was fixed, however when I removed my Otterbox case, I saw that the spaces are all the same dimesion and if I do not use any case dust comes into the phone! If I try to apply some light pressure on the sides of the phone, the spaces come off for certain time and then come back again (I can just assume that the touchscreen glass is U-bent and assembling was not conducted properly). Moreover, when I came back to Ukraine (I am not planning to come back to USA at this time) I have found out that my Galaxy S III does not have possibility to connect to Internet via cell operator service and needs to be re-firmwared. I am sure you understand that it was my intention to buy Unlocked version of the phone to avoid such problems in my homeland!I have visited numerous diagnostics servises who tried to adjust settings but without any success, also they advised me that these spaces between the glass and body of the phone are factory defects for sure. I have also visited Samsung Service center in my city who told me that the guarantee is covered for the goods purchased only in Ukraine and to change firmware will cost about $20-30 and to fix the issue with spaces - around $200-250 (change of touchscreen glass).I like my Galaxy S III but I cannot enjoy it in full because I think it is unacceptable to know that the dust can easily enter the phone without any mechanical damage done from my side and to bring such a big screen phone without access to Internet. Internet connection with T-Mobile in US was ok.After contacting My Wish-List  I was advised that there is nothing can be done in this case and I should stay with my problem alone. The only thing I was offered is a small amount which was their profit part \u201cas a gesture\u201d what did not solve the issue at all.Thus, guys, be aware that this seller does not provide guarantee for the supplied goods (the Guarantee voucher is also supplied without any stamp or other evidence when you bought it and you will stay with your problem what ever it is on your own.Hopefully something will be changed in near future.Yevhen Ivchenko/An Upset Customer Of The Above Seller.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent phone but fragile.", "Author": "F.

I'm using this phone on Straight Talk with a discontinued AT&T; sim card from Straight Talk, although if you're lucky you can still find the odd one on Amazon and eBay. I did a good amount of research about this model of the S3 before buying it, and bought it on kind of a gamble. There's a \"sudden death\" issue that plagues earlier models of the 16GB model phone. Apparently, the 4.1.2 update of the Android OS addresses this problem, but I've read mixed reports. I ran a check application downloadable from the Play Store called eMMC BrickBug Check. It will scan your phone's hardware and let you know if your phone contains the wonky chip responsible for the issue. Fortunately, being a brand new S3 International, my phone (the current 16GB model) does not have said chip so I'm good. Also, my phone came with Spanish as the default language, just a caveat of buying an International model of the phone.Now onto the phone itself. This thing screams. The quad core processor is very fast and almost nothing seems to slow it down. As I said, I'm not a power user, but it works very well for me. It's really thin as well, which is nice considering I have relatively small hands for a man. Even with the Commuter series OtterBox case I bought for it, it's really no wider than my first generation S2 bought for Straight Talk's service. The disadvantage with that phone is that it was locked. This is my first unlocked phone and I'm loving that I can update it at will. I won't call this a review of the phone, just call it an objective opinion, but a favourable one. I'm loving the S3 and really don't see the point of going all in with the recently released S4. If you're looking for a good upgrade for a phone that's more than 2 years old, this might be for you. But as always, do your research before dropping what is as near as makes no difference, 475 dollars.
