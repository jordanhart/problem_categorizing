{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Besides being cute n pink, it has NOTHING to offer!", "Author": "rachel bodnar!!!!", "ReviewID": "R3V8UDWHLMIJMF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I got this phone I was really excited, it was cute, pink, and my first touchscreen.....Anyway, the first problem I had with it was anytime my phone was shut off, and I went to turn it on, the phone would instantly ask me for the PUK code to unlock it. This code is generally used to lock your sim card....so I put my sim card back in my old phone, and had NO problems with it. But for some reason this phone consistantly asks for the code, so I had to call my service provider to get the code, and then I had to write it down to keep it handy in case my phone died, or if I turned my phone off, because it ALWAYS asks for it. I tried to change my security settings....infact, I've \"changed\" them MANY times.....I even turned the security settings off completely, but still without fail, it asked for the puk code as soon as i shut it off then turned it back on.Anyway, this phone is not for people who text frequently....it takes forever to text with this phone! Also, the battery life on this is terrible! So, not only do I have to worry about it dying on me, I have to put the PUK code in everytime it does!I deffinately do NOT reccomend this phone to anyone.....what a waste of money.The only reason I left a review for it was so I could try to save someone else from making the same mistake I did. I hope this helps!", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wouldn't recommend the KP500", "Author": "CJM", "ReviewID": "R246PI1QEE8SJ0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this phone about two weeks ago, and liked it at first. I plan on sending it back tomorrow. I wanted to keep it and tried to find good things about it just because I absolutely hate having to return things I ordered from the internet, but honestly there are too many negatives that overshadow the good things about this phone. The touch screen is bad. When texting, it sometimes takes 3-5 times pushing a letter on the keypad for the phone to register it and add the letter to the text. It's extremely frustrating and slows you down significantly. Also, when selecting something, for example, the \"Messages\" icon (any icon for that matter), the delay is horrible. I'm glad I haven't needed the phone in an emergency, because it wouldn't do you much good when you need to act quickly. I've counted, and it has taken up to 8 seconds to open up a random menu. I love the look of the phone, and it's incredibly light weight- much lighter than it looks like it'd be. But the negatives keep racking up, and I've decided (1) to return it, and (2) write this review warning people of the frustrations I've had with this stupid phone. Keep looking- this is not the phone you want to buy.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love the phone, BUT......", "Author": "S.

The problem that I have with the phone is that I can not put it in my pockets or place it under something.  It will get unlocked and dial the last number on the phone.  Thats the only problem.  Even when the phone is locked, somehow it gets unlocked.  Overall, its a lovely phone. I enjoy listening to my MP3s on it!  Other than it, its a perfect phone for anyone that loves updated gadgets.  Will buy another one if they had it in blue!", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "No US charging adaptor!!!!", "Author": "Kimberly J.

I'm not someone who ever wanted a smartphone so I'm still a fan of basic phones that do not require data plans.  Unfortunately, good-looking basic phones are hard to find.  I thought I got lucky when I found this Lg Cookie in pink since it looks really cute and on top of that it's an LG product and on top of THAT I found an unlocked one online (expensive, though).  I've been using it for about a month now and this is what I've noticed so far:* The touch screen feature is not perfect.  I have such a difficult time texting in both horizontal and vertical screens.  I'm usually a pretty fast texter but I usually end up spending more time deleting misspelled words over and over again until I can type it right (I don't like T9).  I don't have big fingers at all.  I've had several touch screen phones before and this one is by far the most difficult to use.* It doesn't get as hot as other touch screen phones.  I remember using another Lg phone that played MP3s and it would get burning hot after a few minutes talking to someone.  This phone doesn't heat up at all.* Battery life is horrible.  I usually have to charge the phone all night to be able to use it the next day.  If I leave it on silent and don't pick it up for 9 hours while I'm at work, it still drains battery life so this phone is impossible to use for two days in a row without charging it for several hours.  If I forget to charge it the night before, I don't have a working phone the next day.  This is probably the most inconvenient part of this phone.* Voice is crystal clear.  Not sure how clearly people on the other line can hear me but I can hear them very well.* The low battery beep is really annoying.  The intervals seem to be less than 5 minutes and it's obnoxiously loud even when the phone is on silent.I miss the days when phones used to be simple.  I don't want to follow this trend of smart phones because I really don't find it necessary.  I never need to look something up on the internet or play games or have an app for a Starbucks card that I already have in my wallet.  It's all too extravagant for me.  When I go out I like to enjoy being out- not have my eyes glued to my phone.Anyway, I'm putting up with this now until I can find a replacement.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "works in Costa Rica", "Author": "Raquel Castro R \"Raquel Castro\"", "ReviewID": "R2J8E8562DYNP8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i Bought thi phone 2  year ago to use it in Costa Rica, and it works great,it is a great touch phone, the touch screen works great, the volume is high ,everythig is just fine!the camara i great (but it doesnt has a flash) you can edit the pictures wich is great! it has nice games !i just love this phone!", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG KP500 Cell Phone", "Author": "Philip H.
