It worked perfectly for almost two years. The problem I had was not the phone's fault, but mine. I accidentally broke the cover for the charging port off, and I work in a very dusty pillow factory. Dust got into the port, and it was cheaper to just use my upgrade. I nearly cried when I had to switch. Seriously, best phone ever. The battery was decent. I text constantly, so I had to charge it every 2 days or so. The only complaint I had was that the camera wasn't the greatest. I LOVED the dual slide. I also loved the ability to use the voice recorder to record things for my ringtones. This is the phone that made me a loyal Pantech customer.", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC  Phone", "Author": "Enigma", "ReviewID": "R1LMFMLK7K9NEG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Firstly, this phone has some weight to it.  I don't know if it's the slide out QWERTY or what, but it's weight gave me an added sense of security.Secondly, it's sturdy. I can be klutzy. My poor phone has been droped countless amount of times including down stairs and pushed off my desk. Plus it withstood the test of the 3 year old who thought it was a toy.  It has a few scratches, but it still works great.Lastly, I've had alot of phones. I started with the grey ones with the giant battery in the mid-90s and have had almost every type and big name manufacturer around. The Pantech Matrix is by far my favorite.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for my daughter", "Author": "Sabrina Fritts \"Simply~Sabrina\"", "ReviewID": "R2ISUBVK85H0R1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this to replace the damaged contracted phone.
