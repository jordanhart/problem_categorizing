I've had one of the first Razr phones. It worked about a day????? The first time that I dropped it it broke. The drop was about from two feet! Everyone around me laughed at it. I was so frustrated! I did not ever think that I was going to buy another Razr. But this one was supposed to be more durable. And I do like how thin the Razrs are. They fit into my pocket better than other phones. So I thought that I'd give it another shot.  So far it has lived up to the claims. I have dropped it a few times now. And it does seam to be a more durable phone so far. I do love it and do not regret buying it. It's a great phone for the money! \"Thanks for making it tougher for us Motorola\"", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "motorazr 2", "Author": "Michael D.

It's a little different because it seems to be geared for some European country, but it wasn't real hard to figure out, and after slipping in the SIM card, and restarting it, my connection was great. Also, the phone number software that came with it is excellent.The only bad thing is that the instruction booklet is in a foreign language that I didn't even bother to identify. But, the English version is available on the internet.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Unlocked, European V9x version", "Author": "Walt", "ReviewID": "R15ITL4QJ0OH7I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not what I was expecting for, this isn't a WCDMA 850/1900 as showed in this website, it was a WCDMA 2100, and was not useful to me at all, anyway very good customer service and fast refund by J&R; Music.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001CZ8N1A"}}
