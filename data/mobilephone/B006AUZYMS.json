The phone took H+ Digicel Haiti network fresh out the box, very fast phone with a dual core 1.2 Ghz processor, 1GB ram and 16 GB internal memory with dual camera of 8 and 2 MP. I read other reviews on the internet saying that network selection mode was locked in the rom by AT&T; but on mine i can select network manually but FM radio has been disabled in the ROM by AT&T;  but there are a lot of apps on the android market available for local and online radio stations. The battery is the worst thing of the phone as every smart phones today. This is one of the best smart phone out there if it is not the best, outshine the iphone in term of performance but the iphone has a better battery and a good built quality comparing to the galaxy S II, Which is a plastic phone but has to be due to size and weight.  I left Blackberry 9900 for it, i am a big fan of apple products and owe lots of but decided to try this one instead of getting an iphone and i can tell you this is the best choice, for me this is the best phone out now. Hope that AT7T enables radio FM and come out the ICS update for the phone in the coming days.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone", "Author": "Samsung Is awesome", "ReviewID": "R3S1ZMMWTE4L8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for quite a while (almost 9 months)and have been more than satisfied!This is the unlocked version (WARNING) but this review is about the phone as a whole.Pros:-Great Battery Life (nearly all day or about 10 hours)-Amazing screen (nice and big but not too big, really good color, absolutely no problems on display whatsoever.)-Comes stock with 16gb of Hard Drive space and doesnt cost you an arm and a leg for more.
