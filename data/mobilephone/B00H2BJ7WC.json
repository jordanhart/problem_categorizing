I had the Nokia Lumia 920 and likes a lot of the personalization features but it lacked my Pandora, pinterest, myfitnesspal, Spotify, and other apps I use daily so I went back to IPhone.NOW, Onto the Lumia 1520. I  had the IPhone 4S. I liked a lot about my iphone but was bored. Seems like since Steve Jobs passing...theres nothing awing about new phones 5, 5c and 5s. Same ol Same ol EXCEPT now...a lot of my apps are always crashing. My wifi isn't that strong in my room, my front camera quit...and it's almost the same as the first iPhone. A lot of good changes but not very many customization features for me. Plus with apple products...EVERYTHING costs.BEFORE PURCHASE:  I decided to get Nokia Lumia 1520 BECAUSE1. Supposedly had many of the apps that I previously could not get on my old Nokia2. More customization with Windows 83. Beautiful Big Screen Like a Tablet4. Amazing Camera by Carl Zeiss5. Mostly...Side by Side comparison that I did with IPhone 5c, 5s and Lumia 1020.(if you can do this side by side comparison which I did on AT&T...I; would do it because it answers a lot of questions and made my decision 100%)6. Ability to Expand storage with the miniSD port7. Ability to get phone in yellow. It was a hard decision between yellow and red because they are both beautifully vibrant but I went with yellow because I love the brighter.UNBOXING:Amazed by color brightness, screen brightness, size and beautiful camera.In the first few days I learned a few more awesome things1. the Lumia now does SnapShot and if you are or have been an iPhone user this is awesome.2. There is a driving mode you can set up with a Bluetooth device to avoid wrecks. No touching phone while driving.3. Some of the apps that were previously said not to be on the windows phones were now there. In face the only thing I do not have that I used a lot was weight watchers...they just have a rinkidink calculator but im sure that will update.4. I can trim videos.5. The live tiles are awesome.Apps that I use a lot that are available that on some reviews were said not to bePinterestSpotifyRdioInstagramAmazonAllrecipesNetflixPandoraMyFitnessPalApp folder (to organize all your apps like IPhone)FREE RINGTONES...NO MORE PAYING FOR THAT CRAPKidsCornerWallet to store credit cardsRun the MapRuntasticVineYouTubeHDI have had this less than a week so I know I will learn more and I will rereview or add to it but my current Conclusion isIf you are looking to upgrade and thinking about trying something new...better camera...more customization with out sacrificing simplicity...live tiles...mostly free apps...free ringtones...driving mode...no sacrificing your current apps, free office, ability to back up on skydrive and at&t; locker....find your phone...ANNNND SOOO MUCH MORE...SWITCH! You wont regret it.Things to know:1. This phone is huge...6 inches. I LOVE IT...some do not. I can see everything beautifully.2. Get a CASE! SERIOUSLY This phone is very slippery on the back. You need some kind of protection and grip to prevent dropping it or if you do to help protect from the fall. *Be carefully applying tight cases...do not press hard on display screen because you can easily distort color on display screen*3. GET A SCREEN PROTECTOR...I recommend armor brand. They have lifetime warranty and less than 10 bucks with amazon free prime shipping.4. If you want smaller phone..you might try Nokia Lumia 1020...better camera and smaller but lacks some of the specs 1520 has. Do side by side comparison.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent partnership Microsoft - Nokia!!", "Author": "joe \"Joe\"", "ReviewID": "R21T4GF4KRXJDX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nokia built an amazing phone with customized applications and Windows Phone 8 performs flawlessly. Super fast processor, smooth video; you can finally watch a video and listen to it with Bluetooth headphones (mine is Plantronics backbeat 903+).For those skeptical regarding applications, there is Instagram and Whatsapp for W8 (download is free for both) and many more free apps, although Lumia 1520 brings a load of essential applications.Very advisable to buy a cover, not only for its protection but for a better handling. I found the device extremely slippery in my hands. I purchased a cover with kick stand, so I can eat and read or watch a video.W8 automatically backs up most your data (pics, docs and videos) to skydrive, which is very convenient. All contacts I had on my HTC HD7 (Windows phone 7.5) was imported as soon as I register my accounts (Hotmail, Facebook and Google) even without the sim card. A great feature is that you can access your Lumia 1520 from your PC as if it is an external hard drive. You can also receive and send several kinds of files via Bluetooth. The NFC (Near Field Communication)  is amazing!!I still donnot understand people who rather pay a lot more for an IPhone or Android!!I also purchased a 32Gb micro SD (you can install up to 64Gb), which is another feature Iphones don't have.Also amazing is the battery. You will now have a phone that will keep up with you all day, provided you make a normal use of it. Remember to charge it, use it until battery runs out and charge it again, so that your battery will be optimized.Only disappointment regards to the charger which is European. Although seller sends (at no cost) an American adapter, it gets to be a very clumsy piece (both together).Well done Microsoft and Nokia.February 6th UpdateToday I test the Here Nokia (the built in GPS) I turned it on together with my car's GPS, except that I made it work offline. Both GPSs took me from where I was to where I wanted to go flawlessly. The Here Nokia offers more detailed information and precision.

I have used so many phones/OS that I am fascinated by the diversity of ecosystem. I have used HTC Titan, some previous Lumia series  and past Windows Mobile series. After dabbling with iOS, webOS, WM, I have settled on a Android as a primary phone. Nokia Lumia series is elegantly designed. The 1520 is just gorgeous.I am interested in the specs of Lumia from following parameters. phone: size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR ratingNokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP,  Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU  Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)In my opinion, following are key specs to consider. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don\u2019t advertize or mention SAR prominently.The things that pop out is the screen size and the external storage capability. Obviously weight is a downside. The windows phone 8 operating system has matured to a large extent and most of common apps are available. It does still lag its distant cousins iOS and Android. But Nokia has given a splendid hardware. My experience of using camera (one of the best cameras in the smartphone and a key differentiator), navigation, reading articles, books, listening to music, watching videos were flawless. I highly recommend to anyone interested in windows platform. This phone is something to definitely checkout!As for a comparative analysis I have laid the specs of other top 2014 phones. I am sticker to useful specs and I find following spec will help you decide the best phone for your use case.Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version):  5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)HTC One: 5.41 x 2.69 x 0.37 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.7 in, 469 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 4 MP/2.1MP, Qualcomm APQ8064T Snapdragon 600, Quad-core 1.7 GHz Krait 300, 0.66 W/kg (head), 0.40 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolutelty the best phone out there !", "Author": "XBuddha", "ReviewID": "R32FZW1J9PO5GE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had used windows 7 ( dell Venue) but needed something larger in phablet category , since Microsoft OS was not mature ,went to Andriod .shifted from Samsung Note 2 to Lumia 1520 and its great !

So to try and help people avoid the issue I ran into I'll try and highlight something I completely missed. This particular model works with T-Mobile, except YOU WILL NOT GET 4G/LTE connections. The RM-938 model (AT&T; version) is the only Lumia 1520 that can make use of 4G/LTE on T-Mobile (as far as I know).Additionally, I installed WP 8.1 on it and here's a few things to note:- On the device I received, the locale wasn't set to US. The keyboard and other region settings were either in Chinese or English (UK). If you want to get Cortana to work, you'll have to make sure your region settings are set to US.- I had a few account sync issues and had to do a factory reset after installing WP 8.1, doing the factory reset does not get rid of WP 8.1 (which is nice).- A lot of popular apps still don't take full advantage of the added screen real estate provided by the higher resolution. Expect text and other in-app UI elements to be a little blown up (probably wouldn't bother most people)- I've seen many reviews say its impossible to operate this phone with one hand. I can do most tasks like texting, browsing and making calls (especially with WP 8.1 installed) using one hand without too much trouble. I even have a phone case which slightly increases its dimensions. I don't have the hands of a basketball player either.- My device takes a considerably longer time to fully charge than my other WP devices (Lumia 925 and HTC 8X) but that's to be expected given it has a larger battery and lasts a lot longer on one charge- I'd strongly recommend getting some sort of case or cover for this phone because the surface of the phone can get really slippery. Given the size of the phone, if you do not have a good grip when moving about on it (e.g. holding the phone when getting out of the car) chances are you'll end up dropping it.That being said, the phone is incredible and everything I expected it to be, but in this case I imagine that is more of a personal opinion for people given the size of the phone.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing Phone", "Author": "Franco Rothner", "ReviewID": "R397FT9RJLK06U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Windows Phone user for the last 2 years now.

The battery life is absolutely phenomenal, the screen quality is amazing and the camera experience now borders on point and shoot replacement!  For reading books and magazines, this phone is perfect since the display is such a high resolution.  Invest in purchasing an additional SD storage card and this device becomes a 64GB music player.

I also downloaded an application, which scans business cards into one folder.  Built-in Microsoft office and One  Note (which you get it for free)are the best part of windows phone.  Really great phone to work with.  This RM-940 is USA model and I get 4g speed, which is a plus than RM-937.  I am very pleased with internet speed.  This phone is capable of handling all the tasks my laptop does.  Good phone compared to iPhone, Samsung.  Those iPhones and Samsung have lot of hype and lack performance.

I previously used the Samsung Ativ S for about a year and though it was nice enough Unwanted something newer, bigger and with wireless charging. The 1520 offered everything I loved about my previous device (sans Samsung apps, which were no major loss) plus all of the Nokia apps, more solid build, faster updates (my Ativ S never received the latest update, which was a supposedly made available months ago). Plenty of others have already praised the specs and performance of the device, 1080p resolution 6\" display, amazing battery that routinely lasts 35-40 hours of moderate use, fast processor, 32GB of storage plus up to 64 more via micro SD, the device has LTE, but this version is compatible with bands used outside of the United States so I only get HSPA+, which is fast enough since I'm usually using WiFi.

Urbina Cespedes", "ReviewID": "R2LTSKM0ZT9INA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HARDWAREAesthetically this phone is BEAUTIFUL, a master piece! I like minimalist and simple things. I love the 1520 design, everything is placed where it should. Buttons are placed nicely!! The camera button comes very handy!The back camera? Amazing, wonderful! As a photo enthusiast I can say the camera is one of the best phone cameras I have seen with many advanced features! And the camera button comes really handy! The flash sucks. It should have been xenon.Front camera? Still needs some work, for my taste it sucks pretty badly. Grainy and slow if dark! Bad, bad, bad resolution.Sensors are precise and work perfectly, I always turned them off in my S3, S4, Note, HTC's, Moto's because they were random and not precise... they made me rage more than once. Only thing missing is an IR blaster, that would be really useful! And maybe fingerprint scanner ONLY if it works as it should, I think that technology is not ready yet for prime time.Also about Qi charging, once you go for it there's no way back! I even put a DT 900 hidden on my desk and nightstand, charges fast and it is so convenient!Processor? Powerful. You can throw anything at it! If you updated to WP 8.1 DP... It is a DEVELOPER PREVIEW so it will lag a little sometimes and some things won't work as intended, you will have to make a soft reset-restart and hopefully it will resolve your issue or you will have to wait for the official release.The battery in this thing is amazing, I'd never have thought that it would last forever with the screen size but it does! Using Xbox music to stream music all day! Whatsapp, FB and web browsing all day, by 10 PM is still around 15-20%. ~5 hours of listening to music with a Sony Bluetooth SBH20, 4-5 hours of screen time while using Whatsapp, FB, web browsing, skipping songs. Gaming, once in a while.It has micro SD slot, YES! No micro SD slot is a deal killer for me!SIM tray is loose! BAD!Touch screen sensitivity is good, perfect! And I have no more issues with it!Signal is good but it will chose slowest networks (EDGE, 3G, HSDPA+) if they are stronger than the fastest ones. And you CAN'T force it to HSDPA or LTE.Screen is gorgeous, crisp, clear, stunning! But there's a defect with most lumias, in white backgrounds you will see brighter spots in a specific part of the screen exactly where the back camera is placed. Other than that is perfect for me! Anyway you won't notice the bright spot!Glance feature is wonderful! I think it is not supported by 930 and some others phones because of the screen technology used.VERY IMPORTANT. Screen seems to be fragile, still haven't drop it! Case or insurance could save your life, screen replacement is expen$ive. I have seen many post talking about broken digitizers and screens. Replacing only the digitizer is NOT easy at all if you manage to replace it without breaking the screen, that if you are lucky enough and didn't break the screen.SOFTWAREI've had about everything but iPhone, I do love my 1520 but as a power user WP 8.1 is still lacking advanced features/options. About the apps, I have the ones I need but they are lacking advanced options/features because of WP limitations and some others because apparently programmers aren't putting much effort in WP apps. But with WP 8.1 they finally added so much stuff that was missing and with WP 8.1 Microsoft is finally giving more freedom for making apps with everything we need but still not as much as Android.For most people 8.1 will do! I am a power user, but most people are not! They have everything they need in 8.1 (just a few things missing, maybe some advanced options would be nice) BUT the 1520 is BLAZING FAST! Butter smooth! Not like my any other phone I've had!Size of everything is about perfect on a 1520! The keyboard and the new swipe thing is amazing! Cortana is nice, and we have music recognition integrated (I'd suggest MS to improve it, is slow sometimes and if you don't have internet connection you are done. Some apps in Android store the recording so you can search that song later, you can't do that with Bing)! Also integrated translation and QR scan, pretty sweet to translate things just with the camera.Now WP and Lumia has some unique features and apps that I love so much and are freaking good: IE sucks on Windows but on WP is way too good, beats any other browser! Nokia apps are awesome, beamer, maps, camera, etc.!The integration with Microsoft services is good, you will love it! It integrates with many services very nicely!For music lovers, Xbox music pass is the way to go! Better than Pandora, Spotify, etc.! Music player is kind of mediocre but it will do. Gallery is GOOD! Better than android!Clean and simple OS, very good looking! I'd only add a few more advanced options and more transparent tiles for this new image backgrounds! And a color palette to choose our own accent and background colors, that would be sweet!OVERALLHardware is good and this thing is damn pretty! Problems? Loose SIM tray, bright spots on the screen (you won't notice unless someone told you so), front camera sucks, FRAGILE screen. No IR blaster, no fingerprint yet. Battery, screen, processor, sensors, etc are amazing! Micro SD slot up to 128GB!Software? You get everything you need, still missing some advanced features! But 8.1 is getting close to iOS and Android. Still has some advantages and unique design and features, and it is BUTTER SMOOTH. Integrates very nicely with MS services and some others. You have to try it to know what I'm talking about, but Microsoft is doing a good damn job with 8.1.I think a 30-40% fanboys will betray Apple and Samsung if they had this thing for a day. Throw an IR blaster, fingerprint scanner and everyone most of them will be sold, you don't even need some advanced options in apps or OS level. Keep it going Microsoft!Did I miss something?

I enjoy the offline maps where I have all North America downloaded for free thus providing free offline GPS. Coming from iOS and Android, you will feel the difference mainly in the lack of apps thus making the phone less usable if you are a gamer or just download apps for fun.

It was a button right next to the send message, attach file icons on a conversation and it allowed for a better hands free texting option while driving than actually texting. it's no longer there and I haven't found a way to enable it if available, through the settings.Next is the service. I looked before I leapt and everything said that this phone would work with American T-Mobile service. That it would not get 4g lte but would still get 3g service. I bout a Nokia Lumia 810 for my wife same time as this and in most cases I do not get 3g service. She has gotten 4g in my home, yet I standing next to her can barely get E, possibly H, but I've only gotten 3G in small places while in passing. unless I'm tied to Wi-Fi, the data on this is very slow.Had I known about this, I might have gone with the 925, or even the 1020, but this is a very big let down, as now I have a outdated phone, before it's even available in the US.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gr8 Windows Ph, But...", "Author": "Ronnie", "ReviewID": "R15Z5Y4C200G1H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I must say it's an amazing Windows Ph, at least BETTER than Samsung Galaxy versions.

There is a way around it but it's not for the novice.  This is also stated in their disclosure if you have time to read the fine print.(The hardware is excellent. The Windows 8 software works fine. Remember this is a 6 inch phone; almost double the size of an iPhone).So what's wrong w/ MS uploading your private information? Here is the list:- If your email is hijacked the thieves will send money request on your behalf to everyone on the list with an email address. Or if you have your bank account info online things could get worse.- The US government will certainly snoop into your data.- The MS Sys Admins are also a potential source of snooping and passing on the info.If you are a facebook type that puts sensitive personal information on the internet then do not worry. But if you are concerned about security of your data beware of this issue.To get around it is not that easy. Here is what I did:( I use MS outlook desktop version for my Contacts, Calendar, and email - Only if you have this then follow the instructions below):- When you receive the phone - do not setup a microsoft (hotmail/msn) account. If you do they automatically upload your data to their servers (outlook.com)- Don't use the 'Transfer my Data'. If you do they automatically upload your data to their servers (outlook.com)- Purchase Akruto Sync (I am not in any way related to these guys - This is just to sync the outlook w/ your phone to bypass MS) and sync your contacts/calendar using this software.- One last thing: If you are forced to login into hotmail/msn account delete your calendar and contact list first - then login to MS and do what's required such as updates - then go to the settings and set a wrong password for the hotmail (you cannot delete a hotmail account) - then use Akruto Sync to sync desktop outlook w/ Nokia 1520.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very fragile phone", "Author": "hameed", "ReviewID": "R3GA98Y6XCA95N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "You might have thought that this is a brittle phone from what nokia claims and the advertisements. But that\u2019s not the case. Its very fragile. Not like its predecessor.I dropped this phone from my pocket a few days back and the display broke. And this is just a 20 days old phone. I just dropped it that one time.This is the same lumia 1520 that nokia claims to be strong, a durable one.I have used Nokia N95 and Nokia Lumia 800. Both were durable. Dropped it so many times and never broke.Especially the lumia 800 which my wife is still using has been dropped a million times, still works like a charm. Not even a scratchSo looks like this Flagship model, Lumia 1520 is not made of the same quality as its predecessor and its pretty much fragile.When i contacted nokia about this, they said due to this physical damage, my mobile is now out of warranty. I have to cover the expenses now.It costs around 200$ to replace the display. Come on, i cant spend 200$ every time i drop this phone.i should have bought a case. but the problem with the caseis that, this mobile is already huge enough to handle with one hand. This case might increase the size a bit, and i thought atending the calls would become tedious. And considering the durability of Lumia 800 which i already own, i thought this phone would also be made of good quality.This phone tends to slip out easily out of my hands as its huge and weighs a lotNokia service centre ignored my case even though i am a loyal customer. I have always been a Nokia customer. Apart from the Nokia N95 and Lumia 800, i have bought several other phones including the E5 and many other Models, which ofcourse i dont remember now. They have been mailing me Mail templates instead of a proper reply.http://youtu.be/8EWuz4YEk9kEven though i explained my case several times, they are not ready to replace the phone. Instead they wanna consider my case as a feedback.All these Nokia Flagships phones have been very sentimental to me. And i was very heartbroken when this mobile broke. Never broke a phone before. And nokia is not ready to help me out.SO, if u are really considering to buy this Lumia 1520, be ready to spend 200$ every time you drop it.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Power button not working", "Author": "Fh Brink \"Westco\"", "ReviewID": "R34YYZ1MMLXATH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been using this nokia 1520 for one week and the power button refuse to work, which means I cannot switch in on except for plugging in a charger.
