They never mentioned that it would be shipped from China, there were no 3 or 4 days delivery options. So I waited. I received it in 30 days. I used it for 3 days only. It kept on turning off by itself, specially in the middle of conversation. My friends complained that they couldn't reach me. I decided to send it back (note that time for returning the item without being charged is 30 days and I had been using it for 3 days after 30 days delivery). I wrote Amazon and they said it was too late. I contacted the seller, and the seller started to bargain with me saying that they would send me an extra battery and a charger. I refused because the problem was with a phone itself. They bargained again to send me a replacement phone. What??? To wait for replacement for another month??? Thank you!In the end I sent them the phone back and they supposed to refund my money. It has been 2 months now! I NEVER GOT MY MONEY BACK! INSTEAD I LOST MY TIME, MY NERVES AND MY MONEY AGAIN TO SEND THE ITEM BACK TO CHINA!!! FANTASTIC!", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice but", "Author": "mysunnyisle \"mysunnyisle\"", "ReviewID": "R2NK3ANPZ0D4T2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: nice style/shape, small & handy, easy useCons: metal casing got warm/hot after 5-10 min on the phone from the battery (original nokia battery)  short battery life (3-4 hours talk time)After about 1.5 years the charger plug (hole) did not work properly and the program kept freezing. was not able to use anymore", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "NOT SATISFIED", "Author": "Karen Kristie Ong", "ReviewID": "RX6DJYLNV08OX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THE ITEM I RECEIVED LOOKS FAKE AND OLD.
