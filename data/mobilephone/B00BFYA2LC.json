(by secondary keys, I mean the symbols);  they should have been highlighted like the numeric keys instead.  I guess after a while I should remember where the symbols are. lol.  Also, I changed the ring tone for each sim card to my fav song, but they keep going back to default ring and I have to change them back every time... annoying.  A bit more volume would have pleased me more, as I must be in the same room as the phone to hear it - my previous phone was really loud so i got accustomed.my likes: this dual sim phone works fine and is very light for the size, I like that; clear calls, comfy keypad, radio works fine, screen is a good size and the colours are lovely.  I tested wifi and it works fine for the type of phone this is.  camera takes good day pics if you really need to use it.I bought this phone mainly for the dual sim capability so I cant really comment much on many other feature cause i have not use them.  I will be travelling soon to test how this phone works overseas, then I will leave further comments.If you are like me and just want a very nice, simple, smart-looking dual sim phone, then its a good buy.  But, if you are looking for apps galore and quick internet browsing, keep on searching.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "The phone does what I need it to do", "Author": "Karen Billings", "ReviewID": "RDHLIPL8RDK11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a dual sim phone that was not ostentatious or too smart.  This phone fits the bill and is, for the most part, easy to use.  The thumb roller is a bit overly sensitive--I think it is adjustable--and so it isn't always easy to stop on my selection.  The only thing I really do not like, is the orange/red-lighted alternate keyboard which is impossible to read in lighted conditions.  So if I'm searching for an apostrophe or so such, I have to find a dim corner.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$79.79", "Features": null, "Name": "Samsung S3572 Dual Sim , 2MP, WIFI, Unlocked World Mobile Phone - Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51t%2BRWm5CWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BFYA2LC"}}
