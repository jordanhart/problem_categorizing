The BB is my work device, and I own a HTC Evo as my personal phone (on Sprint).  Using them back to back, I can say first hand that for most of what I do, the BlackBerry is the better device.PROS OF A BB 88301.  My BB has been reliable,2.  Allows for quick email response wheenever and whereever,3.  Is great for calls with a bluetooth headset.  connects without issue and is pretty clear, few dropped calls (bluetooth dropping off, which happened all the time with my old Palm Centro)4.  The basic functions work well - datebook, contacts, to-do's, and memo's...  I used these for years on the Palm and while the BB is not as good as the Palm was (sigh), still works well enough.CONS OF the BB 88301.  Internet isn't the best... When I finally upgrade to a newer device maybe that will get better2.  Don't like the roller ball - I like the touch pad that you find on the newer Curve.Advantages of the BB over an Android phone (for me - BB vs. HTC Evo):1.  Less buggy - my BB crashes only a fraction of the # of times that my Evo Android phone does.2.  Reading and deleting emails is FAST on the BB - I can review 20 emails in about 2 minutes, tops, on the BB, including brief responses and deleting masses (when needed).  On the EVO, you have go to the separate delete screen and pick them there...  And reading and replying is slower, driven by the keyboard in particular.3.  Like the memo and to do applications - not as good as Palm (10 years ago) but at least they offer native applications for this kind of stuff (Android does not!!!!).One man's opinion, but I sometimes wish I'd skipped the Evo (and the extra $10 a month for 4G) and gone with a personal BB (in addition to my work BB).", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "dissapointed", "Author": "DK", "ReviewID": "R1FFIKETQEJXNE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Does not work with 2g or 3g.This was not clear on the item descroption.

ONce the phone is outside of contract the customer owns the device therefore it is a clean phone, or if you bought it unactivated. You're still tied to a carrier no matter what.It is possible to \"flash\" phones to for example take a Verizon phone onto Sprint. This is also not easy and you must have knowledge of rooting phones, flashing roms, If the aforementioned statement means nothing then don't try. Also don't expect all the features to work. Sprint and Verizon use different coding for their networks. You can \"unlock\" phones, but you must have knowledge of rooting, amongst other things. Also if you'd like everything to work properly, or at all, I don't recommend it. You can also destroy your phone too. If you have a phone you like don't do this or just give it to some dude unless this gentleman happens to have a PHD in software engineering.All the carriers put software locks on their phones, so even if you have a CDMA/GSM phone, you cannot pop a T-Mobile sim into a Verizon Droid 2 Global and expect it to work. There are no UNLOCKED CDMA only phones,  WHatever carrier the phone was built for is the carrier it will work for, assuming the phone is \"clean\". Now you can go to anywhere else in the world, take your CDMA\\GSM phone and it will work fine with whatever GSM carrier you buy a SIM from.As far as the Blackberry 8830 is concerned, save yourself the trouble and get another phone. There are androids with keyboards as well. Blackberry will not be around for much longer as an independent conpany so you might as well familarize yourself with Android, IOS or Windows Mobile. RIM is dying. There's a reason the carriers slashing their orders for RIM. Rim's market share has fallen every quarter. Ten years ago, Blackberry's were THE smartphone; unfortunately its still the same phone, gui and os  you bought ten years ago. They are built like tanks and extremely secure however, thanks to RIM's separate network.Back to CDMA. Even though most phones nowadays have the exact same radios, the CDMA carriers put software locks on for the US market. Verizon doesn't want you on T-Mobile. Now why you'd want to make that switch is another matter. But Verizon or Sprint doesn't care if you go overseas (CDMA is pretty much US only) because they aren't competitors.

The BB 8830 World Edition can access the Internet and you can check your e-mail with it, too--etc.  However, I would rather do those activities using my home computer.  Alternatively, my recommendation for someone who wants a touch-screen device (3G or 4G or later) with lots of \"bells & whistles,\" should probably get an iPad 2 (or later edition) or some other contending product.Note:  If you are considering purchasing this cell phone (BB 8830 World Edition), make sure you understand whether the phone is being sold as a \"locked\" or \"unlocked\" device.  If you need further \u201cenlightenment\u201d regarding \u201clocked\u201d or \u201cunlocked\u201d devices, then, do an Internet search for that information.Also, determine if the phone is:  (1) \"New\" (never used); that it comes with or without a SIM card; (2) it has a new/unused battery; (3) it has a battery charger or battery charger USB-to-electrical outlet cable; (4) a complete user-guide manual versus an abbreviated version (that tells you little or nothing); (5) that it has a USB-2 data cable to connect the device to a computer--for  downloading a BB OS v4.5.0.311 or later version software for the phone (e.g., probably the easiest way to upgrade the BB 8830 OS it to go your service provider\u2019s web site and find the specific BB 8830 World Edition OS).Additionally, the BB 8830\u2019s battery can be recharged (while in the cell phone) via the USB-2 cable if the Blackberry\u00ae Desktop Software is installed (on one\u2019s computer).The USB-2 data cable can be used to copy an existing address book from a BB 8830 World Edition to your computer for backup, etc. via Access Manger\u2019s Software).  And, this is recommended just in case the BB\u2019s OS crashes and needs reinstallation.  That is, reinstallation will wipe-out all existing information or corrupted files.  So, if you have a copy of your BB 8830\u2019s address book--\u201call is not lost.\u201d  In addition, it is probably a best practice to write down all of your personal settings for you cell phone--just in case you need to reconfigure all of them anew.Moreover, if the BB doesn't have one or more of the following:  A SIM card, desired memory, and, battery, etc. then, those accessories will have to be purchased separately (from a wireless service provider or an Internet-seller of cell phone accessories, etc.).Likewise, if you buy a \"locked\" version of this phone which works with a particular wireless service provider (e.g., Verizon Wireless, T-Mobil, etc.), then, you will have to take it to them for configuration-access and to get a service plan through their network.  On the other hand, if you want to \"unlock\" the cell phone so that you can freely choose a service provider and/or to purchase prepaid card/access--then, you can go to a wireless service provider (of your choice) who can or will \"unlock\" it...if you purchase some type of data service plan (and, if necessary, a SIM card).Note:  Make sure that when considering a SIM card purchase that it is compatible with your intended cell phone usage.  In some cases, it might be wise to have several SIM cards which relate to local and/or international travel.If you can go on the Internet and find/buy a specific BB 8830 World Edition \"unlock\" key-code (for a \u201clocked\u201d BB 8830 WE)--ensure that you have or will have a SIM card and some type of data-access-plan.  Furthermore, it is advisable that anyone using the aforementioned cell phone should get or download the BB 8830 World Edition User Guide (a complete booklet print-version is an included OEM accessory) and Access Manager.Note:  VZ Access Manager (for Verizon Wireless users) and the BB 8830 World Edition User Guide both come on an OEM CD--but if you\u2019re buying this cell phone online, the OEM CD may not be included.  However, VZ Access Manger (which might be the same as the Blackberry\u00ae Desktop Manager), User Guide (partial or full version), and are available for download from various sources on the Internet.  The full version of the Blackberry 8830 World Edition User Guide is probably your \u201cbest bet,\u201d because it illustrates all of the phone\u2019s features & abilities.  Also, if you download the User Guide, while reading it, you can set the viewing size for your convenience.--Russell", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "still waiting for the phone charger", "Author": "yusif ibrahim", "ReviewID": "R27PF4NR7FQXYP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "u sold me this phone and told me that charger is on the way and is been 3 month,when is the charger coming", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "sucks", "Author": "ll", "ReviewID": "R30MK7SUA62J0T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this phone came looked fine a biy of scratches here and there but it doesnt work here in the united states its too old!!!!! do not buy unless its for out of the country use.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "too bulky and no camy", "Author": "Tough critic \"Kim\"", "ReviewID": "R1OAQI913T46E8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I travel overseas about twice a year so I got this because I switched to verizon and want a blackberry.
