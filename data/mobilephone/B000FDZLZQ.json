It was just on market for a week or so. I intended to buy a Microsoft Smartphone kind of device, but came upon this phone. The things that attracted me was the near perfect finish (black version only, feel like the early IBM Thinkpad T23 skin-like touch), the fast response, large screen, transparent screen cover and a unique feature: Business Card Reader(BCR).The BCR take a snapshot of a business card, automatically recognize the information and input into contact list. The character recognition is not 100% if the business card design is too fancy. If the card is standard, with regular characters, the recognition result will be very accurate. It saves lots of time when you finish the job in a long day and rest in hotel room. Remember, you have to set the lens switch to Macro position, otherwise the card photo it takes will be blury and recognition is impossible. The switch is above the lens, very easy to miss.Other features include the radio, recorder, bluetooth, Real Player, voice command, notes, 2.0 MP camera and camcorder.Writing recognition is also very accurate. I write in Chinese and English. Both are very easy to use. Overall, the software are great.It comes with other features such as getting online but I don't use them. You can add Transflash card inside. As of May 2006, the largest card size is 512MB for $70.I don't think I digged all the goodies out, still in the fun process learning how to use it more wisely.

I was really unpleased with it, it wasn't what Motorola made it out to be.  Then I got the V3x, which I wouldn't have done if I knew that it didn't support the 850 GSM Band. It was a lot better than the V3, had an MP3 player, but it didn't support 320kbps MP3's.  I had problems getting a signal with it, cause of the 850 GSM band Cingular uses. Then I saw the Motorola MING (A1200). I've had this phone for a month, and I haven't had any problems with it yet. It plays all my MP3's and it even comes with Real Player, so if you wanna play Video's, you can, but you have to convert them first.  It sucks, but the phone does come with some converstion software. I've also tested the phone with some software that I found off GetJar. I only had a problem with one of the programs, it was an Internet radio.  But the Messengers worked fine. The Hong Kong site says that the phone comes with MSN Messenger, but I haven't found it.  It supports 1GB MicroSD and can record videos up to 2 hours.  The only downfall of the phone is the fact that it doesn't have any 3G capabilities. I, myself, don't use 3G since it my provider doesn't have Video Calling yet and I'm sure that when it becomes available, it'll be expensive and no one that I talk with will get it for years to come.  The phone uses Linux as it's OS. That kind of scared me at first cause I don't know how to use Linux that well....heh, but it's pretty easy to use.  The OS is also Open Source, you can get it from the Motorola Open Source site (https://opensource.motorola.com).  The phone has a virtual keyboard on the screen that you use to type.  There is also a virtual keypad that is used when dialing a number or when entering info that requires only numbers.Here is the short version...if you want a great phone that doesn't support 3G technology, that supports J2ME applications/games, and you can see small letters close up, then get this phone.  If you have to have 3G, then get something else.Hope this helped ^_^.", "Date": "October 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Versatile phone. A little slow. Poor battery.", "Author": "Rodrigo Lopez Schenkel", "ReviewID": "R29P9G5QMZD76Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this cell phone for two months now, and I can say that this is a great phone, with a couple significant flaws. I've been looking for a cheap smart phone for some time, and I have to say this phone meets my basic needs.Pros:- Good looking design, as expected from Motorola- Great versatility. It's many functions add value to the phone. It has everything I was looking for (except full email sync with your computer email client). 2 MP still/video camera, media player (RealPlayer), FM Radio, calendar, bluetooth, web browser, document reader, ... the works.- Linux OS, with Java enabled, which opens a world of possibilities. There are a lot of great Java apps designed for this phone on the internet. Is just a matter of looking for them. My first downloads were the Gmail app (gmail on my phone!) and the Opera Web browser, which is great.- Micro SD slot.- The Real Player is great, it plays most media file formats. And I bought a 2 GB memory card, so it's like having a music player as well.- Quad band, so you can roam almost anywhere.Now, the Cons:- Big con #1: Miserable battery life. I use the phone a lot (for calling, web browsing and it's other functions), and I have to recharge the phone every other day. Thankfully, it comes with the USB cable to connect with a PC, and after loading Motorola Phone Tools, you can charge it via the USB ports of your PC. It's been a life saver at work. This is a major flaw by Motorola. If you are gonna cram so many functions on a phone, you might as well bundle it with a larger capacity battery.- Big con #2: Not so great processing speed. After I read a couple of the reviews here, I though the phone would be blazing fast because of the processor and all, but let me say that I am quite disappointed at it. For example, after placing a call, the phone takes like 2 to 4 seconds to end the call and return to the normal screen. Or after quiting the internet browser, it freezes for 2 to 4 second when it's closing the GPRS connection. Also, the Real Player takes some seconds when it loads a file. It may seem that I'm being a little whiny, but after some time it really gets annoying, specially if you are in a hurry.- The camera, being 2 MP and all, is not so good. You need to have a steady hand, or else you are gonna get a lot of blurry pictures (and the worst part is, if you download the images to your Windows PC, you cannot modify them, because they are transferred as Read-Only, and you cannot just change this on the file's properties. I'm guessing it's something of Linux permissions. I'm still going to look into that). And the video quality is not great as well. I got better videos with my old SE Z520a, which BTW, look great on the A1200's screen.- No full email sync support.- Finally, the screen is a dirt magnet. I have to clean the phone's screen every now and then, partially because I have a very oily face.Although I'm giving 3 stars, I have to say I'm happy with the A1200. Besides those 2 major flaws, the phone is cheap in comparison with other smart phones and has a lot of functions that make it a great every day tool for communication, organizing and entertainment.", "Date": "June 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great phone!", "Author": "Zheng Peng", "ReviewID": "R1VQIKAJSLSZDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's actually a Linux (yes, it's Linux!!!!) based smart phone.

A1200 supports doc, xls, ppt, HTML and pdf files, as well as various picture formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF and WBMP). The realplayer in this phone could play MP3, WMA, RealAudio, MIDI, WAV, AAC and AMR in the background and RMVB, MPEG4, 3GP in full screen mode.

I simply wanted a \"smart phone\" that I can write notes and access my email while I'm on the road, a calendar to remind me of my appointments and yes - it must be a quad band as I travel to many countries all the time. Not a lot to ask for right? Honestly I was looking at a Sony Ericsson quad band at that time. But this Linux based Motorolla won my husband over (I'm not really a Moto fan :( - had a bad experience with Moto before - Motos are not 'dummy' friendly). The extra stuff .. camera, radio, blutooth,real player are just added bonus for me; don't really use them much. Oh, I use the Alarm clock daily - I love the snooze function.I've been using it here in the States since last summer and opened a line with Cingular (since its a GSM). The folks at Cingular helped me access the internet so now I can read my gmail and google anytime, anywhere - just don't stay online too long - Cingular's internet rates can leave a hole in your wallet.The pros ? .. yeah just what the other reviewers said. \"Ditto\"The cons .. lately I found that there are times when I receive a call, only a dead sound would come from it. At first, I thought it was the network's problem but when I switched it off and turn it back on, it was \"normal\" again. A small mechanical defect. Alas, its not perfect after all. I find the battery life short - compared to a Nokia, but my husband solved that problem - he also got me a spare battery.Another suggestion : REMEMBER to put a protector sheet on the screen - as it will take a lot of beating!!I'm still not a Motorolla fan (thus the 4 star), but this phone has met my requirements. And its sleek looks really does impress - even the Cingular folks.....In response to an earlier comment why its not marketed in N Am.This beauty was created for the Asian (China/HK) market in particular. Thus the name : Ming. Statistically - Asians are the highest users of mobile/cell phones - which they usually upgrade often as new models come out quarterly.I'm kinda sad that its here in the States now...my Ming won't be unique anymore.Enjoy your Ming.

McCarthy \"Engineer, CERT, Amateur Radio Op...", "ReviewID": "R2YVD8AIMKZ59Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start out by saying that I got this phone just under a week ago, so I'm a new user and I haven't tried everything out yet.  But overall this is the best cell phone I've ever seen.  I've owned a few dozen phones over the years, got my first when I was 16 in 1996 and have upgraded over and over again.  This is the third time that I bought a phone over the internet from a place other than the cell phone companies page and the first good experience.  The other two were on eBay, and I know you can get it cheaper there but the first one turned out to be a refurb and the second had problems and neither lasted 6 months.  Amazon is a good place to buy because they will take it back and issue a refund if there is a problem, they pay the shipping on broken returns so you don't have to worry about paying anything if you get a dud.I have Cingular, and yes this phone did work immediately without any problems.  I do not have the data service (I don't use text messages, e-mail or web) because my work phone gives me that for free, so I can't comment on those features or on how you set the phone up to work with them.First impression:  The phone looks great!  Not as great as the picture though for one reason:  The speaker, which I was assuming was charged by a EMF and worked without wires, is wired through the clear part.  However, the wires look like a frame drawn on the clear part so it doesn't look bad.  The phone functions great, and comes with everything I need except games (I'm looking for some good card and skill games for it now).  It came with an international charger, which I don't trust so I tossed it in a box and kept using my old phone charger (which was the same).  It also came with a sync cable, which is a growing trend in Motorola phones that have any PDA functions and one which I am pleased to see.The software functions very intuitively.  When I open the screen it brings up a dialpad with a redial button.  If I clear that, it brings up my last call.  If I clear that, it takes me to my various call lists (missed, dialed, received).  If I clear that I get to a home screen.  I can also just hit end and it goes to the home screen.  The home screen is nice, but it has 4 hotkeys that you can program and it would be nice if it could have more or less depending on your needs.  It also has a grayed out background which, if tapped, overrides the screen for you to see it, then goes back when tapped again.  Cleaning the screen is a problem because I keep hitting keys, a key lock button would have been nice to relieve this.The settings menu is well laid out, except it took me forever to figure out how to set the clock (it didn't download the time from Cingular, perhaps because of the lack of internet settings).  Look through all the menus, you'll find it.  I forget where I did, but I was standing in a line for 10 minutes and in that time I set everything up including the elusive clock...I haven't tried music or videos yet, I'll update my review when I get around to that, and when I get some games on it.I took the phone to Disney (my old phone broke 2 days before we were going, thanks Amazon Prime overnight shipping for $3.99!)  The battery said 100% for two days including at least 3 hours of talk and 2 hours of playing around with the menus.  Then it suddenly dropped to 50% (I guess it isn't such a great meter) and stayed there until the night when I decided to charge it, so I can't say how long it lasted but I think that is pretty good for a phone (my last needed a daily charge to make it).  I'll charge it daily anyway, since I'm used to it.Overall, I would reccomend this phone to everyone out there, but I like being the \"only person on my block\" to own it, so I'll tell you not to buy it instead  :-)More details to come in a month or so when I have really tested everything out!", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "More than I expected.", "Author": "Vashanti Gobin", "ReviewID": "R2F657VVLERY42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is simply awesome.

As their \"full retail\" phones started in the mid to high $200's I thought I might as well try to find a phone that really worked as a phone.  Enter the Motorola A1200, or The Ming!I have never purchased an unlocked phone and was concerned that it would not work on my network (my service provider- AT&T;/Cingular) as it was never released in the US.  I called the retailer (JR Electronics out of NY) and they assured me it worked on my network as well as others that used the standard SIM card.  SO I went ahead and took the plunge.This phone is AWESOME!  Out of the box, it was completely in Chinese characters - this scared me a wee bit - but after pressing just about every button, I finally found one that said English and as if by magic, I could read the menus!  It immediately found my network and I have had no problem with it at all.  In fact, as a phone, it has the best reception I have ever had with a cell phone, and I have been through many.  My home is a terrible dead zone, and my wife still gets very little reception there but the Ming works like a charm.It is also a very sleek and easy to use phone.  I love the way it looks - very Star Trek savvy - but would agree with some of the reviewers, it is difficult to open the cover with one hand.  A benefit of that, however, is it never gets stuck on clothing, accidently opening, a problem I have had with many other flip-phones. In fact, my only complaint would be every time I am checking my voicemail, I receive a blank text message.  I am not sure the purpose of this message nor have I yet to figure out how to stop it from happening.Although it is a PDA phone and I do sync with my outlook, I am not a heavy PDA user, using it only for an address book.  One cool feature that really works is the business card scanner.  The camera on the phone takes a picture of a business card and parces out the information into your contacts.  This works well, as long as your hand is steady and the business card is fairly standard.All in all, for a cell phone, I don't think you can top the Motorola Ming.

The screen is incredibly bright and the sound quality from the speaker is very loud and crisp. The interface is very intuitive, although it took me a while to change the screen language from the default Chinese. I am surprised American carriers don't have this phone (as far as I know). It has the full functionality of a PDA with appointments, tasks, notes, contacts etc. The included stylus works great for entering text, with a great handwriting recognition software (although I use the on-screen keyboard because it is faster). Reception seems to be stronger with this phone than the Samsung I previously had. It is thin enough to easily fit into my pants' pocket. I couldn't get my Napster songs to play with the RealPlayer that is included with the phone but I am sure Rhapsody songs would play. Plus, I just started shopping for mp3's from Amazon, which of course play well on this phone. The only complaint I have is with the included synchronization software which is proprietary to most Motorola phones. It took me almost 2 hours to get it to work properly. It is clumsy and sometimes hangs during synchronization. It took a lot of trials for it to finally recognize my phone. I also heard that it is problematic with Office 2007 (I use Office 2003 to synchronize my tasks, calendar and contacts). I had a similar experience with an earlier Motorola phone and it was the exact same software a couple years ago.Besides that, I think it is a great phone, the camera pictures are sharp. I didn't work on the video and card reading capabilities yet, but other reviewers suggested they work mostly fine. I also purchased a 2GB MicroSD card from Amazon (around $25, a great bargain), which also comes with a standard SD adapter, and it allows me to store hundreds of songs and pictures on the phone.

Barnes", "ReviewID": "R1XCKFMXWKR0LO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've own this phone for about a year now and now I'm looking for a replacement. I absolutely can't stand the phone.CON 1:Texting is ridiculously hard. There are 2 ways to text. Using an onscreen QWERTY keyboard, or using the onscreen writing recognition ability. The Recognition really is a great idea and fun at first, but I find that it almost never can accurately recognize a full word. I have to write in all caps in order for it to distinguish letters well. a o e u p all get mistaken. ! = i. So I have to rely on caps, which I don't like writing in. And even then it is prone to errors. Sure you will wow people when you show them the ability, but its kind of impractical to actually use. The other way to text is with a QWERTY keyboard onscreen. Howerver, the each letter is about the size of the stylus, which means you have to use the stylus in order to accurately text. Even a childs thumb would be too big to accurately press the keys. Which brings me to my next point:Con 2:The stylus. Yes the stylus inclusion is nice, especially since its almost required. It has a nice extending ability so that it fits in the phone but can be extended to better fit in your hand. Sadly I lost mine, which is really not that hard because it is kind of slippery and has no real grip. So i figured, no big deal, I'll buy a new one. Sadly, because the phone is not offered in the US, the stylus's are not either, so you can't buy the right one. I tried a few different ones, such as DS's, but none fit into the slot correctly. I found ones to order over seas but it would cost me almost [...] bucks for a 20 cent product.... So now I have to use the phone with my fingers, which is next to impossible. My main purpose of the phone is texting, which like I said is hard without the stylus, so I often find myself wanting to send long texts but too lazy to put forth the effort to do so.Cont 3: The Voice Dialing is too easy to activate. Its just a button on the side that you press if the phones open. Sometiems when I'm using my phone I accidently push it which starts up a loud and annoying speech. PLEASE SAY A COMMAND! PLEASE SAY A COMMAND! DID YOU SAY DAD? DID YOU SAY DAD? Its extremely embarsing when it goes off. It should really require a double click or something to go off.Con 4: The vibration is iffy. Sometimes I can barely feel it vibrate in my had.Con 5: Cheep. If I drop it, the battery cover pops off, the battery flies out, etc. And I really don't drop it that much. The clear screen has a large crack in it. The silver siding has peeled. My phone within a few months looked like it was years old. At least it has a protector over the touch screen! Plus now the flip cover flies open and is very loose.Con 6:Smudges. Most touchscreen devices are like this but the screen gets really gross looking. They should at least provide a cloth...Con 7: The charger. It comes with a wall charger, but I did something dumb and broke it... which I don't blame them for, however, again I can't get the charge in the us. I have to order it overseas... So now I rely on the usb charger which is a pain when I want to plug it in at night and talk to my girlfriend in bed.Con 8: Low battery. All I do is text. I don't call much, I don't play games or use the internet at all. I just text, and yet I have to charge the thing almost daily. The vibrations kill the battery. And I think the system itself is just draining resources and battery life.Pros:Copy Paste Select All abilities. Makes texting and typing easier.Texts open in separate windows, as do programs. You can keep several things running at once without noticing a slow down.Good calendar system.Excellent sound quality and signal with AT&T.; I've used 3 phones including this one in my area which has a weak AT&T; coverage and the other phones were not able to hold calls well and lost connection a lot. But this phone gives me signal in areas I never could before. And its always crystal clear. Its something I really love about this phone.Its cool. Every time I pull it out in public, I get, is that a phone? Can I see it? Thats so cool. They love the clear cover. And I love the attention.

The volume on mine was pretty loud and battery life was ok, about a day and a half with moderate use. There are some nice games out for it, I personnaly recommend midnight pool. It also supposts multiple apps running at the same time, such as browser and a game. It runs linux OS which makes it the perfect OS for 3rd party apps.

I just received my A1200 yesterday and all in all I would have to say, I'm very happy.  Aesthetically the phone is very pleasing although it's fair to say that's more of a personal thing.  It also feels good in the hand, smooth to the touch and just the right weight.  The screen is bright and easy to read, I haven't tried it outside while the sun is shining so I'm not sure if the screen will still be as legible.I don't do a tremendous amount of texting, preferring to communicate by voice but I can imagine for those of you who are stalwart two finger texters this phone may be a little problematic.  With that in mind, I would agree with other reviewers this phone may not be well suited to avid texters.When the phone arrived, the display was in Chinese and it took a few minutes to get it to the English setting but it wasn't a big deal.  I also received the European charger with it, someone had put what they thought was an adapter that would fit over the two horizontal prongs at the top of the plug but of course it didn't fit.  Thankfully my old Moto. Razr chargers work just fine.  I also purchased a 1gig SD card.I've had no problems syncing the phone with my PC, I installed the Motorola Phone Tools software, downloaded the updates and off I went. I even managed to download a wav. file and install a new ring tone with no problems at all.  There are quite a few recourses on the web for those of you who wish to change the theme of the phone or the wallpaper, just Google A1200 themes or A1200 wallpaper.The Business Card Reader may cause you some problems, apparently it was set up for more of Chinese style of business card so it may have problems grabbing the address of English style cards, at least that's what the scuttlebutt is on the net.Although I haven't thoroughly investigated all the bells and whistles other reviewers have I've initially given this phone 4 stars because for a user like me, it has everything I need, it looks good, feels good and the voice quality is just fine.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "good but slow in connecting calls", "Author": "Tom Skywalker", "ReviewID": "R208V3VV3YJTUJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The other reviews say everything about the pros (& some of the cons): Real Player & other cool software etc. I have never been bothered about how fast the phone was, but I am bothered by this: when someone calls me and I pick up the phone, I  have to wait 1-2 seconds before the call connects (with my previous phones, the calls connected as soon as I picked them up).

So there is no use of registering the product also. I contacted the Motorola customer service, and they replied (after a month) that this phone is not eligible for US warranty.Everything below is what I wrote before:This phone is packed with a lot of features and certainly meets various user  expectations. But some of the things I found in my phone are not pleasing:1) Low Battery life, 2) Low volume (when calling/talking), and peculiarly regular/normal voice level when alarm or ring-tones and click-tones like when you navigate).Other than that, I noticed that the first time, you switch it on (after opening package), everything we see is Chinese and I had to search the web for some instructions to choose blindly some unknown letters on the screen to convert the language from Chinese to English - and a great relief.Lastly, I don't see any software updates -- probably the phone is sent with the latest software tool.So it covers most of what we want. A good buy if you already bought, and if you are thinking of buying, compare battery life and volume of other phones with this.Regards,Sooner", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wrong Phone", "Author": "kipposman", "ReviewID": "R2D6EHQ0U8HECD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered the Motorola Ming A1200 as advertised and received the Motorola V3.
