{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The best Nokia EVER made", "Author": "Andy H.", "ReviewID": "R2BFXM5NHDA7KL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have reviewed Nokias in the past and they've all impressed me one way or the other. But this N9 is like a 'dream phone' except that you can actually buy this! The user interface is so intuitive, by swiping between screens, and swiping up to 'hide' an app, or swiping down to close an app, you start swiping on other devices because it feels so natural! The physical design has been talked about at great length on the web already, and it's beautiful design was carried over to their Lumia 800 model. The phone is just so perfect, I could write so much on how I enjoy using it. The feel of it, the weight, the gorgeous screen, the smoothness of the UI. Superb battery life, great camera that takes really nice photos, the built in apps...the list goes on.Mainstream apps are the one thing you might have problems with - if you're an app monster - which I am not. There isn't a McDonald's app, or a Kindle app, or even a banking app, but if you need excellent map apps like a 'streetview' app, turn-by-turn navigation, restaurant finder type apps, then you get those for free. Plus facebook, twitter and others are baked right in, so no need for external apps there. And everything is so pretty! Nice animations, buttery-smooth, very nice indeed. No hangs, no freezes, just everything you need, and it all works beautifully. The onscreen keyboard is a beauty as well, the haptic feedback makes it feel as if the vibration is right under where your finger is, and the word suggestions that pop up are a real help for the odd misspelled word. I really enjoy using it, and I'm someone who's always been a stickler for physical qwerty keyboards. All in all it's a very impressive device - your iPhone and Android owning-friends will be impressed too!It really is Nokia's most amazing phone ever. Shame they are not going to produce anymore MeeGo based phones, as they are now all chips in on Windows Phone, but the N9 is receiving regular updates and features. It's already had PR1.1, and 1.2 and 1.3 are coming this year, so support is definitely there.I give this Nokia N9 a solid 5 stars. I wish I could give it 6  :)", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "I LOOOOOOVE IT", "Author": "Ting", "ReviewID": "RN7V21DXSTAOD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SWIPE SWIPE SWIPE----EVERYTHING!!

It is a very excellent phone, runs smoothly and very fast I might add. The app store is not the biggest but it has sufficient apps to offer. Everything runs fine. However after about a year or so the speaker became distorted and when calling people , they were not able to understand her. It works fine with headphones however.But I still consider this a serious problem", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "excelente", "Author": "johan saavedra", "ReviewID": "R28306TN9M04XT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "buen producto con llegada r\u00e1pida de atenci\u00f3n y tiempo, la especificaci\u00f3n deseada sin problemas de contratiempo recomendado este vendedor ok", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$249.89", "Features": "MeeGo-Harmattan 1.2 OS", "Name": "Nokia N9 16GB 3G Wifi GPS NFC GSM Unlocked Meego Touchscreen (Cyan | Blue)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QpcBlCuSL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0064LKE9G"}}
