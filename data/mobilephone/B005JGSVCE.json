First, they are great sellers and have amazing customer service.  I had several questions and they were right on the emails, answering quickly.The phone is great. It has nice features, like a speakerphone, and it's just the right size.  Very user friendly.  It comes with a charger, and it charged up fast.When I turned it on, all I had to do was hit the send button and the phone contacted Verizon.  This automatically programmed the phone with my number and activated it on my account.  Easy, easy, easy phone to use. Good sound quality whether I hold it to my ear or use the speakerphone.The price is right, too.  I shopped around and could not find a phone at a reasonable price on Verizon because my upgrade isn't due.  I checked Walmart and Radio Shack, but no luck on a nice basic phone at a reasonable price.  This is a good deal.It's a very nice, sharp looking phone that fits right into the palm of my hand.  I highly recommend it, and Brown Box Bonanza.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy", "Author": "Blount", "ReviewID": "RDCRCHJK4G2EE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my mom because she is older and likes the big numbers and text.

I have a digital camera, and I have a good laptop, and I don't need it all rolled into a cell phone.  It works reliably, and the Verizon network provides excellent coverage everywhere, even in rural and mountainous areas.  If there's a signal, you'll be able to send / receive calls with no problems.  I have used this phone for over 2 years, and it has been trouble-free.  If you need a so-called SmartPhone, then this phone isn't for you, but if you need only a reliable way to stay in contact almost everywhere, then buy this phone.  You can find good deals on lightly-used examples on both Amazon and eBay - just make sure that the phone has a \"clean\" ESN before you buy.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Haven SCH-U320", "Author": "georgia hunter", "ReviewID": "R20GNZAVE1PKLY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A gift for my husband (birthday) and he's someone who doesn't care for change.

Unfortunately a week after it was activated it stopped receiving text messages and kept saying message box full delete messages. Easy enough... Except there was nothing more to delete. I hard reset the phone, brought it to Verizon, and after a few hours there and on the phone with technical support the phone was deemed defective. I'm from the cellphone industry so no biggie, I know defects happen all the time especially with used(refurbished) phones. Amazon was great though!! They offered to give me my money back no problem, unfortunately I cannot do that because it would leave me phoneless for too long and I cannot afford that so I'm pretty SOL.The phone itself is.... Well decent enough for an old phone! Great call quality and battery life!! That's definitely it though lol. No camera, no features, nothing but a phone.

The Knack would vibrate once when a message arrived, clearly indicating it was a text message. The Haven vibrates three times, which tends to be annoying because when it's in my pocket I can't tell if it's an incoming phone call or a text (since it vibrates three time it could be a phone call, whereas the Knack would only vibrate once for a text message).It does what I need it to do (phone and text).", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Haven U320 Verizon Flip Cell Phone", "Author": "Michael J.
