Smithwick", "ReviewID": "RFUP9AJURUOUH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros- Great Price tag, Dual core processors and the 1GB of RAM make this phone really snappy. The frotn facing camera is a nice addition, the build quality is nice with gorilla glass and aluminum accents around the sides, 2.3.6 with ICS in the future, 4G LTE is nice as well, the screen is a good size.Cons-The cameras aren't exactly the best quality colors are muted and the sharpness isn't there. The screen doesn't name enough colors and pixels are slightly grainy, the battery charges quickly but drains fast, no SD Card.I have had this phone since the day it came out and so far it has been pretty good. The phone has really snappy performance with the Dual core processor, 1GB of RAM, and 4G LTE make the phones performance feel really quick, the dual cameras are a nice addition.  The promise of Android 4.0 ICS in the future means that this phone is a little future proof.  The call quality is great and the keyboard is easy to use and type text messages or send emails.  The camera and the screen both could be better but these are no penalty box.  Some people complain about LG's interface but I find it isn't to intrusive and has some handy features. Battery life is abysmal in the best of situations but on the plus side it charges pretty quickly. Overall the 79.99 price tag retail is very fair for the features you get, so this is no penalty box for a phone and you will be pretty happy with it in the end.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone for the price", "Author": "BGroovy2", "ReviewID": "R3EVT89WCMXG0X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To start off, this is not a review about Verizon customer service, that's a whole different scenario! This is strictly about the LG Lucid phone. Since our old phones were wearing out, we decided to up grade to our first smart phones. The selling point was the price and the duel cameras that allows use of apps like tango...trust me when I tell ya, this is a grandkid thing!When the phones arrived, the activation instructions were simple to follow and only took a few minutes for each one to be up and fully functional. After having these for a week, they are easy to use and set up. They come preloaded with some good apps. If you like phone games, you will have to download your own. It only comes with two demo games, no solitaire!All the functions that I have used perform well. The dual-core processors are very quick. I have not used it as a wi-fi tether yet. 4G connectivity has given us no issues so far. No matter what type of building I'm in, there is always a couple of bars on the signal meter.The only real con to this phone, as with all smartphones is the short battery life. It has to be charged everyday, vice once a week. You will want to download and install JuiceDefender to extend the battery charge. I am going to order the extended life batteries in the very near future to try to improve the battery life issue.It appears that once again, Apple has been beat at their own game. This outperforms the iphone in price, network speed and dependability.Update:We got the extended life batteries for the phones now. It does extend the battery life with moderate use. If you can resist the urge to  play on it all the time, you can get a couple of days worth of charge running juicedefender.Keep in  mind though, your cases will not fit because of the bigger battery. You will have to modify them to make them fit. I cut out a square hole in the back of my wifes jel case to make it work.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Packs quiet a punch for the price!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2BOZIK0XL3XUQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm upgrading from a Droid Incredible, which was slowly dying in the hardware department because the charging port kind of busted and wouldn't charge half the time. And the construction, while stylish, felt cheap and flimsy. When I heard that my mom was going to get a new phone early, we were trying to find the best deal. Knowing me, I wanted the best phone possible, which would be like either Motorola or Samsung Galaxy branded. Then when mom was talking on the phone with Verizon, she got a deal with this phone. And I thought, \"Ugh, no, not LG,\" because I heard LG wasn't that great. That was years ago and apparently, that was a huge understatement. This phone is by no means, a slouch. I'd say this is not only for beginners for smartphones, but also for advanced users that have a tight budget. However, it is not without falls, though. I'll be comparing this to my old phone in several sections.Build: This phone feels really nice in the hand. The construction is not cheaply made and has a good weight to it. The Gorilla Glass display also feels sturdy and solid. The battery cover is also easy to snap out so you can exchange batteries for put in an SD card.Style: The handset may look ordinary in the front, but the sides and the back do look really attractive. The sides look like they were partly in silver (but its not). The power button is on the top ride side of the phone and the other side is what looks like a button, but it really isn't. The back is smooth with a black and red pattern on the back.Hardware: I already talked about the build, but lets get more specific here. The screen actually looks great and vibrant for a mid-range phone. The screen resolution isn't the greatest as you can tell when looking at texts in the browser, but it's good enough to make it look pretty good as well as responsive. Calls can come in through the top pretty clear compared to my Incredible, which was hard to tell what people were saying as they were fading in and out on that phone. And they can hear me pretty good, too apparently. Inside of the phone is a beast that could take you by surprise. Armed with a 1.2 GHz dual-core Snapdragon processor and 1 GB of ram, you should have nothing to worry about for app compatibility, at least for a long time. The charging port on the phone is the same on the HTC Incredible, so finding charging cables made it a little easier as they do work with this phone. The only bad thing I might say about this area is the battery, which will have its own section.Software: It is running Android 2.3.6 aka Gingerbread. While it was nice on my Incredible, it makes my phone feel like its behind the times. However, there is a promise of Android 4.0 aka Ice Cream Sandwhich (ICS) in the future, so there's still hope there. It has LG's Interface overlay, which I wasn't thrilled about at first, but it actually grew on me as it had a nice set of widgets I found to be even better than HTC, like the dialer widget. Though the dialer is a click of a button away on the homescreen, it's still a nice touch if you don't want to exit your homescreen and it is very functional. Another widget is Social +, which connects your FaceBook, Twitter, and Myspace (who uses Myspace anymore!?), and it is really nice because not only check other peoples' statuses, but also your updates on the ones you made and your messages, which you can reply to through the widget. The calendar and note widgets are nice as well. I only wish you could sync FaceBook events and birthdays to the calendar, but I'm being nit picky since that was the only thing I liked about my previous phone. I could just use MyCalendar Mobile for that. Another thing LG added was 4 different themes to switch from. How convenient! Though you can just download a 3rd party Launcher and probably be happier with that too.Connectivity: It can connect to 3G and 4G Verizon towers for internet, and can have voice over data, something the Incredible didn't have. Though you won't get unlimited data on this phone thanks to Verizon's selfish need to rape people of their money (Why Verizon, why...?). Not everyone has wifi at home, so that was a lame of them. You can create a hotspot with this phone, though. Sadly, I can't get 4G in my area (c'mon Verizon! Give me my money's worth!!), but when I'm out connected to 4G, it's really fast. Much faster than 3G, which is obvious enough. It has Bluetooth 3.0, which I had no problem with since I can easily connect my iControlPad (iCP for short), which is a bluetooth gamepad I use for games and emulators on it. I haven't tried a bluetooth headset, though, but when I do, I'll mention it in an update for this review.Apps & Games: This phone will load games almost immediately, thanks to its speedy processor and gig of ram. Apps like FaceBook and Instagram don't lag at all. Gaming is pretty solid on this phone too. From Words With Friends to Grand Theft Auto III, it runs like a champ. There was hardly any glitches in GTA III and it didn't force close at all like it did on my 4th gen. iPod touch. There even emulators available in the market as well as other places to download. From Atari 2600 to an N64 emulator, it still runs great and they all work with my iCP. You will not be bored with this phone as it will let you play all of your favorite games, rather it be new on the market, or old-school style.Keyboard: While it lacks a physical keyboard, it comes with a decent LG-branded onscreen keyboard and Swype. You will love Swype as typing with be a breeze with one finger. You literally swipe from one key to the other on the screen to create the word. There are other keyboards you can download from the Google Play store if you wish it.Cameras: The cameras are actually pretty good. Not the sharpest, but not the worst either, hence the price of a mid-range phone. The back one is a 5mp camera, which takes pretty good pictures and supports full 1080p HD video recording at 30 fps, which is actually pretty good. The front facing camera is VGA quality and its great for taking a picture of you and a loved one or video chat. I haven't done any video chatting yet, so that will be a future update in this review.Battery Life: This phone contains a 1700 mAH battery. Oh, I really want to say, \"Yes, this battery life is awesome!\", but its not. Its not the worst, but if you're a light to mid user, you should be fine for a day. If you're a heavy user, though, then I'd recommend bringing a charger, or at least an extra battery or two, or get an extended battery.Conclusion:Overall, I'm pleased with this smartphone. Its a worthy upgrade from the Incredible as it. The pros outweigh the cons and would highly recommend this phone for people who are new to the smartphone world and on a tight budget. Does everything a phone should, and more. Just make sure it has all the features you want.

However, the battery life is so short you need to carry the charging cord around with you where ever you go!  Even with my settings minimized, the battery is almost totally drained within five (5) hours.  I couldn't even get through a day at work without recharging it!  I did locate an extended life battery for it, (at a cost of $42.00 from Verizon) and that seems to help, but it has now doubled the weight of the phone and I cannot find a case that accommodates the extra size of the battery and battery cover.  Does anyone know if one exists?Other than the battery issues, the Lucid is really slick!  I love all of its features, it's really fast, accurate, does everything I expected and it handles apps really well.

It suits me perfectly.  It's nearly as flat as Razr, while being a lot less oversized.  I wanted a smartphone that looks and acts like a smartphone, all while fitting into any pocket.Lucid is running Gingerbread, which seems considerably faster and more stable than Froyo.  I would've liked a phone that ran Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box- updates play havok with my phones - but the Nexus seemed a bit cumbersome.Lucid's processor is fast, maybe not as fast as the top tier phones, but still plenty fast. It comes preloaded with a decent amount of apps and features - a phone widget for immediate dialing, Nav, Google Play Music, Book & Movie, and access to the app market Play Store.  Verizon threw in a few of their apps as well.  While these cannot be deleted, they don't take up tons of room, and are easily ignored.Phone quality is very good, much better than my older android phone, and it's nice having a face button for voice mail.  The front and rear cameras take decent pics and are easy to use.  Of course the best way to gauge if a phone is right for you is by giving it the hands-on test, give Lucid a shot.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone but...", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1K4CH7TKRISR3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the LG Lucid for almost 2 weeks already and so far i have to say this is a pretty decent phone for the price. Currently you can get this phone for either 30 bucks or almost free. Usually phones like this are usually bad phones, but the LG Lucid is an exception. With a Dual Core and 1G of Ram it makes this phone pretty snappy fast. The loading time from when you turn it on is pretty decent. The screen is not huge but its not small either, and the 4G network is pretty decent.CONS:Some people might complain about the fact that it does not come with an SD card and yea its a bummer however you can a decent card here on amazon for real cheap.Battery life....Yes the battery is not the best and i wish it would last longer, however i knew that ahead of time and i feel that almost all the phones, with some exceptions (iphone, Droid Razzr Maxx and others) will have battery issues. Plus you have to keep in mind that the more you do with your phone the quicker the battery will drain. So if you plan on gaming on your phone, or always texting, or browsing the net at all times then you might want to consider buying something else, or you can always get a battery pack! Which is what i did. Bought one here on Amazon for about 20 bucks, best 20 bucks spent in my life, can charge my phone twice on it. So think about doing that, it still beats getting a larger battery for twice the price.Call Quality: Not sure if this is me only but the quality does seem a little odd at times, i've had people tell me that they sometimes have a hard time hearing me and i do have to say that on speaker there is a little cracking on the voice. I don't really think is anything major, and i hope it stays that way.Bloatware: While some of the apps that came pre-loaded were some that i used (google apps, Netflix) others are just JUNK. This is probably the only real thing i hate and wish bot the company (Verizon) and the manufacturer(LG) would stop putting bloatware or at least let us remove themPROS:Dual Core Processor1GB Ram4 Inch ScreeCamera, Decent picture quality and video quality plus front and back cam's4G/3G supportAndroid 2.3 SystemOverall i have to say that this is a decent phone for the money, and if you are looking to get a new phone that has 4G and that is pretty fast and at an affordable price, then go for this one, but be warned that the battery is not the best, and again i would recommend getting a battery pack.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "moving up from a chocolate touch", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3A7HMFFFM12SF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I happily used an LG chocolate for almost three years, and have passed that great phone on to my husband.

It's the PERFECT size..large screen, smaller overall size. It is great for that.  Haven't had it long enough to really speak to the battery issue.  It takes time to get all the apps loaded and updates settled in and to get the phone optimized.  Also helps to get past the fascination stage.

Unfortunately, they put it on the back.  This means for best quality you obviously have to turn the phone upside down on it's brilliant face, and this is odd because now you can't see who you're talking to or use the keypad without holding the phone. Maybe it's just me, but the only reason I really use speakerphone is for multi line meeting calls and hands free functionality. Using my hands to flip over the phone repeatedly to hear or accept incoming calls seems a bit contrary to usability.Bottom line:It's a great phone, with good call quality and the wonderful Android OS. It processes all with ease and seamless transition, which is nothing short of impressive for this little phone. If you're going for a smartphone or a new android, I would recommend.Compared to Black Berry..-It's way easier to use.Compared to iPhone..-iPhones do have better battery life than this particular model.

I've had this phone since August of 2012 and already I feel like I need an upgrade because this phone is a piece of junk. Sadly I'm stuck with it.Cons:-The battery life is awful. If I have the screen brightness set to 50% and use apps that require wifi (usually inside my house), the battery will be nearly dead within 2-4 hours. I'm 15 years old and I'm a communicator. I text all the time and I talk to a lot of people on Facebook. Having to stay plugged up almost constantly is not fun. Don't even get me started on how much the 3G/4G (as it swaps back and forth for some reason) eats up the battery. I watch the battery percentage go down by the minute if I have the data on.-The phone gets hot very quickly and overheats if you have the screen brightness up all the way for more than half an hour.-The browser constantly crashes when I try to type in a URL or search for something. I often have to reopen the app 2 to 3 times before it quits acting up.-Speaking of crashing, other apps seem to be crashing often as well, as well as the keyboard. Luckily, the phone itself doesn't freeze up too often, but it freezes up enough for it to be annoying. I often end up having to remove the battery and letting it rest for a few seconds before putting it back in.-It takes a ridiculously long time to turn on. This is a huge pain if I need to make an urgent phone call and my phone has shut off or frozen in my pocket.Pros:-I like the photos it takes on the back camera. The front camera's not as good but I can deal with that because I love the quality of the back camera.-The music player is decent, though a bit annoying when ringtones get mixed in with the actual music (that can be fixed easily though). It plays music louder without headphones than my iPod Touch does.-It charges very quickly when plugged up to an outlet and not a computer. (This would be better if it didn't lose its charge almost as fast.)-The call quality is okay.Overall the phone's pretty bad, but it does have a few high points to it, such as the camera and the music player, which are two things I use on a daily basis. However, as soon as I get the chance or the money, I'm switching to a new phone immediately. This one isn't worth using any longer than necessary.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG Lucid - First phone I have ever really disliked - Unfriendly user interface - Poor battery life", "Author": "RatherLiveInKeyWest", "ReviewID": "RR129VE25Q5SF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Three months ago I let a salesman talk me into 'upgrading' from my HTC Incredible 2 (3G) to a LG Lucid (4G) at \"no cost\"... right. The cost of frustration quickly outweighed the 'free' purchase; in my humble opinion, the Lucid has a horrid user interface while its software is insufficient and not user friendly at all. When I made the switch to the Lucid, was visiting a VZW store with a friend and just hanging out as she upgraded her phone... so that's what I get for not doing research before purchasing.After just a month of using that Lucid, I tired of cussing at it and opted to get an HTC Droid DNA (thankfully, my wife's phone was ready for its 'new every two' upgrade and she nicely gave that upgrade to me as a Christmas gift). The DNA has been an outstanding replacement, and here is a summary of observations on the Lucid based on my experience with it as compared to other phones I have owned (Motorola Droid, Droid X, HTC Eris, HTC Incredible 2, and others):To start off, the Lucid seemed to have a tad smaller viewable screen area than the phone it replaced but the Lucid was noticeably heavier, and the sharp corners (not rounded at all like both the Incredible and the DNA are) became a literal pain in the #$%... I am just not a holster kinda guy, preferring to carry the phone in pocket, and the Lucid was just not comfortable to carry in pocket for me.Turning the Lucid on seemed way more time consuming than it should have been; thankfully I did not need to reboot it a lot. Once it did get up & running, the shortcomings really became apparent to me.Right away I realized that the user interface did not have LCD notification capability -- at least there was no way I could find to turn on an LCD blink to let me know of newly delivered email, text or even voicemail messages. What a pain. As a matter of fact, the phone's resident voicemail app would not connect with my VZW voicemail; instead, I searched the Google Play store for a decently rated voicemail app and downloaded it -- and only then could I access voicemail.In my opinion, email was not any better: The email setup process was seemingly more time consuming and less friendly than with other phones. I could not figure out how to setup the interface to allow interactive server connectivity to systematically remove email from the phone once removed from the host server... instead, every email had to be manually deleted from the phone. The interface did offer an integrated email Inbox either, so each email addy had to be individually reviewed and managed. Lastly, there was something seemingly just not right about the Lucid's ability to retrieve emails at all; it would not go get them and push them to the phone unless I manually did the following, in order: Manually activate Mobile Data, wait for the 4G indicator to appear, manually activate Sync, and then hit Refresh. Yikes...Texting with the Lucid was OK -- the virtual keyboard felt fairly small and induced more typos from my stocky fingers, and the touchscreen alignment seemed a bit finicky. This led to more than a few interesting auto-spellcheck corrections... one of which I initially had to apologize to a neighbor's wife for, but has since become the 'butt' of neighborhood jokes.  I like to keep texts in simple, threaded order and that is where the Lucid's resident app just failed as it would only show texts in the 'great for a preteen's use' bubble-speak format. Really...?Another pet peeve for me is that LG decided to place the on/off button on the right side of the phone, and I was always accidentally hitting it or getting it confused with other switches (like volume). That placement was just a pain for me.OK -- so the concerns above were enough to make me not like the phone, but the next two made it completely unacceptable:Battery life of the Lucid seemed non-existent; out of the box I got about 4 hours total up-time before having to recharge, and that was without any real usage. Seriously. After installing my favorite Easy Battery Saver application, I got 6 to 8 hours max. Yep, really. Then I turned the Lucid's screen brightness down to its lowest level and that extended battery life to 12 or more hours (but hey, who needs to be able to read the screen anyway...)  I had a second USB cable that fit this phone and had to take that cable to work in order to tether the Lucid to my work laptop... just to make it through the day. Not much fun.Based on feedback I received, the call quality experienced with my Lucid was seemingly not up to par with other phones I have used. People generally noted that I sounded distant and muffled, and to me most of them sounded somewhat tinny. Signal strength, based on the phone's indicator, was much lower than experienced with my other phones.  When comparing with my family's phones (when all in our home) and with colleagues' phones (in and around the office), I always had one or two bars less signal strength than others and most were Verizon customers too.Was there anything good about this phone?

You have to pop-open the back cover (also called the battery cover) using the same opening as the charger port.  A new user does not want to damage the charger port, and it takes a little patience to be sure that you are handling the delicate SIM card and the removal of the back cover with proper care.After inserting the SIM card and battery, one is instructed to charge the battery.  A blue light shows that the battery is charged.  At a later time, you can add a battery charging screen (three are available and are stored within the smartphone) so that you can view the progress of the charge.There are video tutorials stored within the smartphone and a very fine series of help screens located at Verizon.com under Support.The smartphone feels very much like a tablet.  I was able to watch movie previews by accessing the App (icon) to an online movie site.One of the main reasons that I wanted a smartphone was for weather-watching during hurricane season.  There are various ways to use Apps (icons) that are basically shortcuts to features that you wish to use.  The weather App also functons like a pop-up screen to give you instantaneous viewing of local time and temperature.  My primary interest is the tropics, however, and I am able to access [...] easily.  I will download the App from that site at a future time.By the way, you can use Voice to access sites on Google.  You can also use Voice to display the name of a person or a telephone number (that you had previously entered); you can then touch the name or number and then send the call.  Voice can be used for text-messaging as well.  As a young senior (age 63), I really like these Voice features.I own a Canon digital camera and did not buy the Lucid 2 for photography.  Those people who do use a smartphone for photography may wish to read reviews about this feature on Lucid 2;  my understanding is that three or four other smartphones might be a better choice if photography is one of your priorities when buying a smartphone.I have read some online, professional reviews that criticize the Lucid 2 as being plain from a design perspective.  I disagree.  One reviewer -- whose opinion matches mine -- said that the Lucid 2 is gorgeous.  It is.  It is elegant and fun to use.UPDATE:  I am having a lot of problems with freezing and lack of responsiveness.

This has happened a lot. I've had many cell phones, and it's pretty common to drop them and have no damage other than cosmetic--scratches and small cracks.Also, the voice command never recognizes my voice when I'm driving. So as far as having a safe hands free GPS, this thing is worthless. Again, my last phone (Motorola's first Droid) worked great as a GPS.The transfer of photos from the phone to my PC is also quirky. My PC tries to import EVERYTHING when I just want to move a few photos from the phone to my computer.I called LG (these are issues with the phone--not Verizon--although the Verizon rep talked me into buying it) and the tech guy basically just told me that dropping a phone would always cause problems, that I'm not using the correct voice commands (I looked it up and guess what--I was using the correct commands) that I spoke too fast, too slowly, it didn't like my tone (ha ha ha) etc. He talked me through getting my pictures onto my PC by ONE by ONE opening every jpeg-labeled file in my phone until I found the pictures I wanted. Wow--really?--that's not my idea of user-friendly. It used to be simple--plug the phone in, see the pictures, select the ones you want, click transfer--done.I'm really disappointed.

However the email application's poor performance caused me to return it and switch back to the Charge.  There are two email features which absolutely BLOW on the Lucid.  If you have multiple email accounts, you can switch between them by using a pull-down menu to select the one you want.  In comparison to the tabs (which are always visible at the top on the Charge), the Lucid is more difficult to manage your email while driving.  The worst of the email application is the way the Lucid processes new messages.  If your email account has folders and you have rules setup to send new mail directly to a specific folder, the Lucid doesn't recognize this.  all messages show up lumped together.  I have 20+ folders with rules to manage incoming mail.  The Charge handled this beautifully and would allow me to view each folder separately.  The Lucid has no concept of folders other than those it had by default:  (inbox, outbox, trash, sent...).  It does not recognize custom folders you create period, which also means you cannot move a message to one of the custom folders.  I really wanted to like this phone, but the email was a deal breaker.  If LG does significant work on the email app in the next update I would reconsider switching back to the Lucid.From the apps I have found to enable wifi tethering, those which require root access only allow peer-peer wifi for the LG Lucid.

So when I saw this phone and the Spectrum (I really wanted the Spectrum but settled for this one) I felt the need to upgrade my phone and service. My first experience with a smart phone was not a good one but, also not an LG and was promptly returned to verizon, could not stand it, and went back to a more basic phone (LG) with a little data.  I have always been able to depend on LG phones and have never had any problems, I have tried other manufacters but always with in a week or two went back to LG.  So needless to say I am an LG fan.  Back to this phone I got this phone because of the price, you can't beat a penny, activated it and enjoyed this phone so much I returned it for the Spectrum (which cost more than the penny spent).  My only complaint would be the battery but I would have learned to get past that or get an extended battery.  Comparing this to the Spectrum both function the same, the Spectrum display is obviously bigger, the call quality isn't as nice in Lucid as the Spectrum, it seemed as though I had to repeat myself alot or ask the other end of the call to do so (actually this is what made me switch because I actually use my phone as a phone in addition to the other stuff).  I very much liked this phone but prefer the Spectrum. Both are very nice looking but need a case to protect them, easy to use, easy to read, and easy to set up.

Price non-withstanding.  I have three issues with the phone, all of which are unacceptable to me.  I use the phone moderately, meaning that I get or receive perhaps 5-7 calls/day, and I spend about 30 minutes a day playing \"Words with Friends\".  Issue 1:  I have to keep this phone charged constantly, meaning that I keep it charged any time I'm home and often in the car if we're driving any distance from home.  The claim by Verizon (where I got the phone) that it gets 12 hours from one charge have not proven true for me.  I did everything I could with the settings to extend the battery life, without success.  I can almost watch the battery indicator decreasing each time I use the phone.  Issue 2:  When you get a call on this phone you have to swipe the face of the phone to access your call.  Fully 70% of the time, I have to continue to swipe, swipe, swipe and swipe before I can access the call, and in fact, there have been several occasions when the caller hung up before I could access the call.  Issue 3:  In my home (which has full wireless service) I can only rarely get a connection for the internet.  I don't have this problem in the car, but if I want internet service at home, I don't use my phone.  I got this phone for $50...when the retail price is said to be 10X this?  No wonder.  This phone is a real disappointment for me.

I could not believe anyone would design a cell phone this bad.  Yes, the battery life is short, but the worst thing by far was the keyboard.The touch sensitivity on the phone was horrible.  I had to smush every letter, pressing hard against the phone.  That still didn't stop the Autocorrect from randomly breaking up normal English words into two or three parts of unintelligible nonsense.  It inserts a space before punctuation and I found no way to turn this off without turning off spell check or hitting double space between every word.  Everything about the keyboard was counterintuitive, extremely annoying, and unchangeable.  I eventually downloaded a different keyboard which was even worse than the one that comes with the phone.  I had to type most words twice or up to five different times trying to get it to input correctly.  Google talk chat had a serious echo problem for the person on the other end. After only a few days with the phone I began to loathe using it to do anything.  Even the text messaging program pulled up friends' emails instead of their phone numbers and sent them emails instead of texts.  This defeats the purpose of having separate email and SMS clients and makes texting more complicated with friends who don't have smart phones.I think people have the impression that more features is always better.  But that's not true.  A simple, intuitive,reliable phone that does what you want it to and allows you to communicate without going insane is the real budget smart phone of the future.Luckily I had rooted my two year old Incredible 2 and installed a new ROM on it to hook it up to T Mobile.

To begin with I purchased this phone at a Verizon outlet in Waterford CT. Since I had a ferry to catch, after looking at the phone I told the salesman that I was interested but would pick one up later. He offered to set up the phone in less than 10 minutes and I agreed. Well, he installed the wrong SIM card.This turned into a nightmare.Once on Martha's Vineyard I called Verizon support on the 4th of July. The representative told me they could send out a SIM card but it would be better if I picked one up locally. There is no Verizon store on Martha's Vineyard but Radio Shack does have a location here. I thought it would be closed but the representative said she would call and verify if the store was open AND if they had a SIM card available. So I waited patiently for about 10 minutes while she did this. She got on the phone eventually and said she called, spoke to them, that they were open and they had a SIM card. So I drove up there in 4th of July traffic, which was horrendous. They were closed.So I went home, and called and requested that they ship a SIM card. The representative this time agreed but said that it would take several days. I asked to have it sent one day considering the frustrations I had. This could not be done, but at least they would send it.Later I received a voice message stating that she made a mistake and they could not possibly ship a SIM card.At this point I decided to return the phone within the 14 day return period as I had only had the phone for 3 days, it was never activated, and dealing with Verizon was pathetic.So I called and the representative said the only way to return the phone was in person to the store it was purchased in. I flipped out. They wanted me to take the ferry, return from Martha's Vineyard to Connecticut to a mall where the Verizon store was. We got into a heated exchange. Finally he stated that he cleared it with his boss and I could return the phone by mail or UPS by calling the store and arranging it with them. I said, fine, I'll pay the shipping just to get this phone out of my life. This of course was after another long wait while he found his supervisor and got an answer. So I asked him for the address of the store.This entailed another long process. Vertizon does not have the information for the purchase at the representative's fingertips and so he then has to get out of the program he is in, put you on hold for another 15 minutes, and then get you the data, but not before a long winded and complicated explanation as to why they do not have access to the information.Okay, fine, I get the phone number and address of the store. Of course it was on the receipt I had, but that was in the car with my wife who had gone shopping. In case you are wondering.Then I called the store. I told them I had cleared it with Verizon and I would like to ship it back to them. The clerk immediately said, no, you can not ship it here. You have to call customer service to make arrangements to sent it to Verizon. Well, I just went through an hour talking to Verizon and having them explain to me why exactly that is impossible.Is there a silver lining to this story?Well, yes, there is, his manager got on the phone with me after another wait, and we worked it out. I shipped it back via UPS and they will credit the phone to my credit card plus the shipping. Needless to say, I am not renewing my contract for service with Verizon.
