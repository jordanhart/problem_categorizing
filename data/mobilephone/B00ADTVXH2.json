I would recommend this the Incredible 4G droid to anyone looking for a good phone!", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent phone", "Author": "William Bettes \"WBettes\"", "ReviewID": "R3SUNPOVIXUOE4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone primarily because I did not want to have to renew my contract with Verizon and lose my unlimited data as well as the ability to jump ship if I so decided. In this sense, the phone is well worth the money. Though this phone came out at about the same time as the phone it replaced for me (a Motorola Droid RAZR), Android seems to have forgotten about it. It came with the version of Android known as Ice Cream Sandwich whereas my RAZR had Jellybean. It additionally had the HTC Sense overlay included, which I am not particularly a fan of--I prefer a close-to-stock Android experience. Once rooted and given a new ROM, though, it functions really well. Decent battery life. Note that this phone (as well as other HTC phones, as I understand) are not particularly easy to root-you can't use a one-click rooter to root this phone.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great replacement for Verizon iPhone 4!", "Author": "A. Morton", "ReviewID": "R17A1QW4ZZ7PVG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My iPhone 4 was out of contract with Verizon, and I did not want to sign another 2 year deal for a number of reasons, including the fact I was grandfathered in to the unlimited data plan. This phone fits all my needs, has 4G LTE which my iPhone 4 did not, is customizable in lots of cool ways, and will work on any network, including when I travel and change Sims! Maybe when the Nexus 5 come out I will upgrade, but I'll definitely keep this phone for a spare for the kids or when I travel. Very happy with the purchase. Should notE the vendor sent it without the 16gb card it originally came stock with, so he must have pulled it for his own use or resell, which h did mention in the item description but made setting up the phone a pain with only the onboard storage. I ordered a memory card and when that comes the phone will be perfect for my needs. If you can find one with the card it shipped with, you wont have the same out of the box storage problem so you might want to find one where the seller did nit take out the mSD card. Goodbye Apple, and good riddance!", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ADTVXH2"}}
