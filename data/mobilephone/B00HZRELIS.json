The obvious choice would be the Note 3, but its advantages didn't have any value to me. For example, the Note 3 has a higher resolution screen but it's hard to tell a difference even up close. The Note 3 also has a stylus but I rarely used the stylus on my Note 2.So I took at look at the samsung galaxy mega, but that was way too wide. I then looked at this, which is exactly as wide as the note 2/3, but a little longer. Still, I hesitated to buy this because the professional reviewers criticized its curved screen, but they were wrong. I can't quite explain why, but the curved screen looks better than the straight screen on my Note 2. The curving creates some sort of visual illusion. It's also easier to hold against your head when talking.One other advantage is that you can physically bend the screen. I tried this at the store with the demo and I bent it a good 5 degrees or so without it breaking. My note 2's screen cracked when I dropped it from four feet and it was expensive to replace, but I imagine this will be less prone to cracking. Huge advantage over the note line.It also has good reception and the sound is better than the note 2. It has a surprisingly good speaker (for a phone).", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Must have phone of early 2014", "Author": "MekoRush", "ReviewID": "R1VE4QF1UYUPKW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yes i'll say this phone easily won first quarter of 2014 as i'm sure other phones in the next 3 to 9months will out shadow this phone and heres why. Ok It only have about 3 big WOW features that stands out, Big Screen, Flex, self healing feature. Other small things like 2 apps open at once its very nice with the big screen. It pretty much does everything the Note 3 does without the stylus with that being said not as precise. Ok now for the Bad, touch screen sensitivity, after putting the Balistic case with screen protector it comes with the double tap the screen to turn on the phone feature becomes harder to perform. It still work like a charm with your fingers but say you want to be different and use your palm, nose,or knuckles it really doesn't work right away....Next up is the keyboard, maybe this is just a android thing but compared to the iphone's auto correct when typing fast it doesnt work, it shows a list of words but it doesn't automatically select one so you will do a lot of back spacing if you type fast..... Last, most of the LG built in apps are basic and nothing fancy, like the stock browser and simple layout music player. If you want to use voice control to play songs it only works on stock apps and it actually doesn't automatically play the song it just highlight the song you tell the phone to play so......... One more thing is the battery really does last about 18 hours easy, every since i got the phone it has never died out on me and I use it a lot at work.Get this phone if you are tired of samsung products and HTC isn't your cup of tea.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent, Unique phone.", "Author": "Snowgator", "ReviewID": "R9H1YASXQVMLL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a fan of large screen phones, my wife asked me to contrast these types of devices. She was a current user of the Samsung Note lines, so the standard was set pretty high. This was on the market, so I checked into it. However, the best thing we could have done is give this beast a chance. It is a unique, fun phone. For those not familiar, The LG Flex uses a special type of material on the body and screen tech to allow for a curved device which \"flexes\" a small amount to give it a bit of durability. It also has a \"self-healing\" polymer material on the back, which small scratches disappear over time. Crafters have had this type of polymer on their crafting boards for years, where after they cut out paper or whatever they have measured out, the boards polymer material slowly fills back in the scratch from the cut to it's original design. Do these advantages pay off? Well, this is a HUGE 6\" device. The best thing about the curve is that is makes it actually easier to handle. More comfortable to hold then similar sized phones like the Note3 or the Nokia Lumia 1520, it is much easier to carry and use. The curve also makes watch media and playing games on it a joy. Something about the \"theatre\" feel about it makes it fun. My wife is a reader, and she feels the curve screen is also perfect for that. The screen itself is nice- vibrant and colorful. details shine. One of the advantages of a large phone is that the internal antenna is also large, resulting in great reception. 4G/LTE signals are held onto tightly, and call/texting signals are never lost. Call quality is fine, and the curve feel helps with the comfort of a phone call. Notice I said \"help\". This is still a huge phone, and managing phone calls on this large of a beast is something you had better try out first. The UI and tools LG has attached to Android are okay. It is heavily layered, and that may have some effect to the long term smoothness of the phone. You will need to understand how to manage background tasks and deleting unused apps. It is a well stocked, quad-core device, so the processor is fine. Out of the box, it shines. It moves effortlessly from one command to another. Just be aware: All Androids need some fine tuning to keep them that way. If you learn how, the Flex will be an excellent long term device. Disadvantages: That self healing back is a finger print magnet in the first degree, and slippery. You may opt for a case, and quite simply put the Flex has very few options in that area, so be prepared to look for one you like. The curved screen resulted in a lesser Hi-Def screen then what other phones use, so while excellent, there are better ones out there now. The UI is pure preference, and LG has made it so either you will love it or hate it. Also- LG has put the volume controls on the back of their phones. This results in a smooth, small bezeled footprint, but again- try it first.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "RWNFTX8X6QEZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the Flex, I did a lot of research and went with this one. Yesssss, it is big, but I wanted big. I really needed a multi media device that could make calls rather than the other way around. It's actually great for calls too, molds to your face and sounds great. Media and pics are stunning, I can read web pages and emails much easier with the increased size. Battery is outstanding, I had the LG Spectrum and had to switch batteries around 5 pm each day with a fresh one, not the Flex. I think I have only ran down the non replacable battery twice since I had it and that was with very high usage. I am very happy with my choice.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "The cinema on phone", "Author": "Jannie", "ReviewID": "RU85FAHV70HTY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This one is the best phone. Love the ways it look when you watch the Movie or youtube, phone is loud and clear sound, I have never gave any phone for 5 stars the reason I did not gave 5 stars to this phone Flex due to picture only 720p, but because it is a small screen you will not notice.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT PHONE.

LG's slogan\ufffd \"life's good\" really holds up to it,especially with the massive battery(it last FOREVER) I'm an AT&T; employee and so I did a ridiculous amount of thought about what phone to get next (upgrade with \"Next \" program), boy am I happy I went with the Flex over Note 3 or HTC 1. (You wouldn't believe how many Samsung phones I see that are messed up and my warrenty center has to replace) I've come to realize that yes LG sells less phones but the customers that do have LG are extremely happy. Quality over quantity! I was so happy with my LG G Flex that I got my girlfriend the LG G 2. I recommend ether the LG G Flex or the LG G 2 to anyone, dont be a sheep and get a Samsung or iPhone, your the one that has to use the phone get the product that is actually quality", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Jeremy Bates", "ReviewID": "R3TWBSRRCR8G5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing phone, thought I should put my .02 in especially due to the apple fanboy that can't figure out how to have 2 gmail addresses so his son can watch YouTube.

So you put in your Gmail login and you're good to go right? WRONG??1) It will only let you have ONE Google email address logged into your phone. Which is great if you only HAVE one, but stinks if you have more than one account like my son does.2) my son is 17 (well in a month). But since the Google gmail account he uses for school is the one registered to the phone, he can't get into YouTube to see all the videos and song downloads he likes because they are rated \"18 or over\"3) You can't change the registered birthdate on a Google account once you're set it up4) You can go back to the phone company and set up ANOTHER Google account, but since his \"other\" one (that lists his age as \"over 18\") is NOT his school one, then he can't get to his Google School account for his assignments.Just something to be aware of if this phone's for an older teen. Oh, he also had trouble fitting it into his jean pockets.The things he liked about it were the larger screen (HUGE compared to the iPhones) and the Widgets that come with the OS.
