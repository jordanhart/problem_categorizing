The phone has a solid hardware however when it comes to the software, the phone is a total mess. After updating it to MR2 (Windows Mobile 6.5.3) I am constantly facing bugs, freezes, and sudden loss of memory content on my SD card. I wouldn't recommend this phone to any person looking for something fast and steady. If you really like Windows Mobile go with the Touch Pro 2 or the LG Expo or the Samsung Omnia Pro(B7610) which all have nice physical keyboards and I think are more steady.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worst smartPHone ever", "Author": "Mya", "ReviewID": "R2T05ZVZKFOKHB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone 1 year ago and paid almost 600 dollars for (incl s&h;). I had really hight expectation, specially be cause I've always had a Sony Ericsson, and they're known for their great camera phones! Boy was I wrong!! Ever since I got this phone it was reacting really slow. There's always a problem going on with this phone. Its either freezing or restarting automatically. And there's the issue with the phone having a hard time connecting to the memory card. And if you take picture, you can't save it to the memory card, it can only be saved to the phone memory (which holds like 10 pictures!). And I was expecting decent photo's with the 8mp Flash camera.. well guess what; It takes FOR EVER before a picture is taken, and its always blurry!! And the flash is supposed to be useful when taking pictures at night.. well it isn't! Unless you're taking a close up picture of your own face, the flash has no use at all!!THE CAMERA DOES NOT HAVE A STABILIZER!!If you're having an emergency and you need to call 911 or get a hold of someone, Let me warn you; YOU WON'T MAKE IT!! it takes forever with this phone to get to the dial menu and call! (that IFFF it doesnt freeze!) And even when you receive calls, you gotta giv it a sec or 2 before you hear a voice!The alarm clock is completly useless!! Why put it in there if it doesnt work?? Not that you can use your own music to wake up to it.. it doesn't matter because when you wake up in the morning (and you're late) you look at your phone (which is on your night stand) and see THAT ITS OFF !! yes it just randomly do that! When the phone handle an app or doesnt respond to the alarm, it just shuts off!All the above are just SOME of the issues that this phone has.The only PRO i can give this phone is the keyboard!The keyboard is nice and smooth, very ideal for chatting/Im/txting or even writing in the MicroSoft Office Document!Because this phone is not on the market in the states, I had orderd mine online and couldn't get a lot of review about it.It was brand new, not refurbished or used! Yet it had all these issues. im very dissapointed..", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "review", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R27Q6K1STAWA9O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DON'T BUY IT !!!!
