The dual SIM slot setup is pretty handy, though I wish it were easier to differentiate between lines (alternate ringtones would be nice). I've thrown it in a pool to test the waterproofing, and it survived with no leakage at all. It is vital that you properly torque the battery cover screws, because if those aren't screwed in well enough the watertight seal will be compromised. It makes it a little annoying to change memory cards / SIMs, but those aren't actions I really do all that often. The cover screws seem a little soft, so I'd suggest using a properly sized screwdriver lest you damage them. The walkie-talkie feature is neat, but the software is very much proof-of-concept, and until new software is published it isn't a terribly practical feature (the volume is always at max, turning every break of squelch into an ear-bursting blast of static).On the whole, I'm pretty pleased with it as a smartphone, and I'd suggest it to others.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't live up to the hype", "Author": "lex", "ReviewID": "R2MYRN9X0E9O3X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Thought this phone would be the one for me to upgrade to a smart phone.  When it was received I noticed the battery charger cover came open pretty easily and should of returned it then.  It landed in a puddle and was there for about 5 seconds a few days ago the phone looked fine and operated with no problems afterwards.  Then it started turning off and on.  I pulled the battery and placed in in rice for a day.  I noticed condensation on the inside of the camera lens and also on the led lens.  After the condensation disappeared I pulled the phone and turned it on with no problem.  Then phone works all except the loudspeaker on the outside is distorted now when it is on loud, and the notification LED does not work at all.  I approached my seller who is overseas since no one in the USA has them and he said i was on my own.  I have an email out to the factory but it states on the service memo they do not pay for water damage.  I think the water came in through the speaker since it is having the trouble and the camera lens right next to it had condensation. Hopefully I ca get it repaired but it's not looking good.  If you want a true rugged phone go with the Samsung BT series.  Have had it for 2 years it has been scuba diving swimming multiple times and dropped from all heights with no problem.  Maybe one of these days someone will make a smartphone as rugged.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Android 4.0 phone, IP 67 Waterproof rating, SOS 1GHz Dual Core processor Walkie Talkie: 400-470 MHz, 5-10km 8 Megapixel Rear Camera + 0.3 Megapixel Front-Facing Camera", "Name": "Runbo X5 - 4.3 Inch Screen Rugged Android 4.0 3G Phone with 1GHz Dual Core, Dual SIM, IP67 grade Waterproof, GPS, Walkie Talkie", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dC64o-wRL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CSSDHFC"}}
