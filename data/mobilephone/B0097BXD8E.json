The description said the phone was new. From the sounds of it, this phone was NOT NEW since the screen had been replaced.

It's super fast, lightweight and a pleasure to have. I love the slim design, and the silver and white colors. The phone does not overheat which is also nice. The quality of the pictures is excellent from the phone's camera. The battery charges very fast which is helpful. I'm also very happy with AT&T; customer service they are wonderful. I purchased this phone from the apple store and have had no mechanical problems with the phone at all. It has been running smoothly for a long time.Unfortunately the reception is not good and most of the phone calls get disconnected. Eight out of ten calls get disconnected. I have to stand in one place and not move while using the phone so the call does not get dropped. This is very difficult to deal with when making important calls, and all calls are important.I also find the screen to be too small and the print is very small. I've been told there is no real way to make the print larger. The print being so small is a major reason why this will be my last iphone. I am interested in the larger screen options available on other smart phones.
