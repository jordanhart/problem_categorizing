{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Important About Unlocked Note 3 Phones", "Author": "Ryan Lewis", "ReviewID": "R1IXGD7T8G6JK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We all know that the new Galaxy note 3 is the talk of the town but some people whom want the phone but don't want to get roped into a contract will purchase an unlocked version of the phone. But before you buy the unlocked version their is some information you need to know about the different models of the phone(s). The Galaxy Note 3 was released in many country's on every continent. Although anyone can buy the phone from any country; each model was made to work on different frequencies. In this review I am going to go over each model of the Galaxy Note 3 and the services recommended for use with them.But First everyone may be asking about the Region lock attached to the phones. Yes before the phones are unlocked their are region locks attached to the different models forcing them to only accept SIM cards from their designated country's. But after unlocked the Region locks are removed. Does this mean that all models will work everywhere, no, but I will be going over if the phone will work in your region after the locks are removed in the model descriptions below.Second the different levels of service. Depending on your area and the service towers available their you will get different letters to indicate service level and the speed you're getting. Below are the most common levels and their average speeds in order for your reference during the Model review.1. E = EDGE/GSM: When getting this sign you are getting the weakest signal for your phone but are still getting non-roaming signal for general calls and text. I advise if this is your areas mane signal strength you have a Wi-Fi signal avalible for the data internet conection.2. G = 2G/GSM: When the G is showing you are getting remedial signal but still pretty strong. Calls and Text's will be flawless and you will be able to do general internet surfing but you will not be loading any HD videos or have perfect connection to online only game's. With this I still recommend a Wi-Fi signal in your house if you plan on using the internet in these areas.3. H = 3G-/HSPA: This signal is classified as 3G but runs a little slower depending on how close you are to the main tower. If you're getting a good amount of bars with signal will do flawless calls, text's, and you'll be able to comfortable able to surf the internet and load videos at a max of 480P (360P recommend for best result).4. 3G = 3G+/GSM/HSPA: This is the full 3G speed and will be also flawless with calls, text's, and be able to stream video like netflix(Recommended 460P), play online games, and surf the internet fast and easy.5. H+ = 4G-/GSM/HSPA+: This is the signal that most first generation 4G phones use. Perfect for all light movie watchers, and small business people. Flawless calls, text's, and the internet is speedy. H+ although fast has been known to be faulty in a lot of area's and was quickly replaced. If you've got this signal it's still 4G but it's kind of like the EGDE version of 4G.6. 4G = 4G/GSM/HSPA+: This is the 4G signal that most 2010-2012 4G phones use such as the Galaxy S series (Sept for the S4) Although this is a very fast and reliable it is not LTE but for the average person whom just watched movies and plays online games on their phone this signal is more than enough to give you a crisp fast feel and load HD movies (720P Recommended but not limited to.)7. 4G LTE = 4G+/GSM/LTE: This is the current signal that everyone is going after. It is lighting fast and is the most reliable for non-stop videos, gaming, and downloading.Now for the common phone models:1. SM-N9000 3G = International/Made for Travelers: This is the international model. This one has a dual quad core processor running at 1.9 GHz Cortex/1.3 GHz A7. The reason for the processor being change is because this phone is meant to work everywhere their is a GSM signal and kicks threw the different processors to maximize signal strength. The N9000 CAN NOT to 4G speeds of any kind. This is due to most country not having 4G signal and that a lot of county's run on different cell frequencies. By removing the 4G radios this phone can pick up way more cell frequencies then the other models. This phone is not made for people looking for Data speed this is made for travelers whom want a reliable way to have cell service no matter where they are. Don't despair about the data or processing speed this phone still has Wi-Fi connection available and can breeze though 3D games; you shouldn't even notice a speed difference when doing tasks.2. SM-N9005 4G LTE = European Model/International: This model contains the regular 2.3 GHz Snapdragon Processor. This phone unless unlocked is Region locked to only European SIM cards, after unlocked their is no region lock. Although this phone is an LTE phone it can only get LTE frequencies while in Europe. When you take this phone out of Europe it will get international signals but will not get LTE, when this phone is in the USA is will get H+ (Reference above) signal maximum.3. SM-N9002 3G = China Model/Select Counties: This model is not LTE or 4G compatible. This was the First generation of the Note 3 released and is considered the Beta. With all the same hardware as the LTE version this phone will still preform flawless tasks.4. SM-N900W8 4G LTE = China Model/Select Counties: This model will only get LTE in select counties and I advise you check with your service provider to see what signal you will be getting. This model is completely subjective as to what frequencies of LTE you will be about to get. Example: Imagine you are in Europe and you are in a city and get LTE. Then you move to another city and you lose LTE this is because the first city runs on an LTE frequency the the phone can get but the second city although may offer LTE to most cell phone; does not offer LTE on a frequency this phone can't run on.5. SM-N900A 4G LTE = USA AT&T;/Worldwide: This phone is International but you need to consult AT&T; to see if you city or county can get LTE service or not. This phone once unlocked will work on Straight Talk, Solavei, T-Mobile, and any other GSM based network. Note: When using T-Moble, Solavei, or other services that piggy-back on the T-Mobile towers you can get LTE service but depending on your area you may not get 3G. If you live in a 3G area consult your carrier to see is the frequencies for 3G match up with this phone. (This review for the AT&T; model can change at anytime due to AT&T;'s bootloader)6. SM-N900T 4G LTE = USA T-Mobile: This phone when unlocked can get all USA frequencies. Example: You will have no problems using a AT&T; SIM card with this phone and even get 4G LTE threw any service whom provides is. The N900T model is the most versatile model out of them all and if you plan on getting one I recommend going to a T-Mobile store and purchasing this model outright. Unlocking this phone is easily done threw calling T-Mobile and even using YouTube for an unlocking video.So out of all the models the N900T is the most versatile, but unlike the N900A (The second most versatile) the N900T is harder to find online already unlocked so you will most likely need to buy if from the store and unlock it yourself.I hope this review has helped with you decision about what unlocked version to buy.If you have an questions or addition to the review please leave a comment.Video review of phone Specs and features coming soon.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Important About Unlocked Note 3 Phones", "Author": "Ryan Lewis", "ReviewID": "R2776W67DECPL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We all know that the new Galaxy note 3 is the talk of the town but some people whom want the phone but don't want to get roped into a contract will purchase an unlocked version of the phone.

The N9005 or a carrier model is the only way to go.This international version is not for US users or even US users who travel. If you are not a traveler forget the comments about it being region locked.I still say 99.9% of all people who get the Note 3 could not care less if the international version is region locked.  However, this model, if you expect to use it in other countries has resulted in a thousand problems, literally. The phone is neutral but when it is activated the SIMM locks in the region and you cannot use it elsewhere.  Do not think \"unlocked\" means you have magical usage.  There is NO universal phone (except for spies), although some phones use other country SIMM cards -- but not this one!  I get a US carrier phone, travel internationally, and keep my phone in airplane mode and use WIFI or get a phone card.Get the scoop.  Do a search for XDA-Developers dot com, and go to the site. This is where the big boys and girls hang, for programming, not dumb questions.Type in Galaxy Note 3 in the field for the phone you desire.In the Forums, go to galaxy note 3 general.Search down the page to the thread \"SIMM restrictions on unlocked European Note 3.\"  This thread has over 1300 posts.  Yes this is a big problem.Read the first half dozen pages and the last 10 pages, but also check especially posts 1041 through 1045, and pages 117 and 18.This N9000 phone is the international or European version. It was released 2-3 weeks prior to the US versions, it is NOT LTE it is 3G; it has a different CPU -the Samsung Exynos 5 processor, not the Qualcom Snapdragon 800. US residents should not get it.  We need to get a phone activated for our respective carriers, which changes the last digit of the number. Search Amazon for the Note 3 for your carrier.  Notice the different last digit.Amazon may be confusing people by not listing the phone for what it really is and they need to change that in the title of the phone.  The black version does say 'International\" in the title and so should the white one.Now, down to business.First, I am not affiliated with Samsung in any way, nor do I work for a cell phone store.  I am a writer though.Secondly, I hate long reviews where the poster just reports the specs you already have.  Rather, these comments show why the Galaxy Note 3 is more technologically advanced, and more phone for your money, compared to the many good phones on the market today, and the not so good phones, like the cave phone (that's what I call it) that does nothing.1.  The beautiful  5.7\" Super Amoled HD display has a \"Wow!\"  factor.  Everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080P, 386 PPI.  Despite a few good contenders, no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color, and deep blacks.  Check it out for yourself.  For those who prefer drab, you can even adjust color intensity and contrast. Is this practical?  You bet.  You get more viewable data for all social networking apps;  you can see more email and contacts without scrolling; browsing is quick and pages more visible; YouTubes and video are fantastic; games are more playable; you can see larger areas on GPS maps;  you get a better view of radar in weather; (live) wallpapers look great; you can use it as a reader; you can multitask with it; and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it.  I will never go back to a small screen phone.2.  The CPU in the US versions is the quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 @ 2.3, which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time.  It will perform well for years to come.  A few other phones have it.  The international version uses the Samsung Exynos 5 processor. It also has another quad core processors making it octa core, but it is still not quite as fast as the Snapdragon.3.  The Adreno 330 GPU is the best on the market, a few other phones have it.  It is 50% faster than the Adreno 320 in the Galaxy S4 which is a screamer.4.  It's the only phone to come with 3 GB of DDR 3 RAM.  It also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage  and you can add more with an SD card.  Note: No extra charges for these!5.  It has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software, a BSI Sensor, Smart Digital Stabilization and high CRI LED.  Very few phones have this.  It is also the only phone to  do 4K video right now - sharp!6.  No other phone has USB 3.0.  2 advantages: the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable.  File transfer times are faster.  With USB 3.0, a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the Note 3 to my (high end) PC.  With USB 2.0 the same file takes 57 seconds.7.  How many phones have an S Pen?  Except for email and quick notes, I seldom used the S Pen on my original Galaxy Note, but the Note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional,  and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate.8.  How many phones have a huge 3200 mA battery?  It easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen.  Hardware and software improvements make the 100 mA bump over the Note 2 even more significant.  You can also open the back and change out the battery - unlike some phones.9.  It does infrared remote control.  It also has TV-out (via MHL  A/V link),  Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, and gesture sensor.  I'm serious people, you get more for your money.10.  Hello multitasking!  The fast CPU & GPU, extra memory, and high-resolution 5.7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone.  You can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen.  This is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth or USB, and connect through HDMI to your TV or computer monitor.  The Note 3 can actually serve as a small computer.  How many phones can do that?  You can also mirror the phone screen with your smart TV for internet, games, viewing pics, whatever.11.  This the best cell phone for gaming on the market , period.  The above features and OpenGL 3.0 which is part of Android 4.3 make it happen.  Don't believe me?  Read the reviews, watch the you tubes, and compared it for yourself.12.  It doesn't just have GPS, it also uses A GPS (improved), and Glonass Satellites.  DL a GPS satellite app, and you'll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location.13.  Got Knox?  No, you don't.  This phone provides business enterprise, and government level security for boot, VPN, etc., and comes in handy for privacy on public Wi-Fi.  You don't have to use it, but it is there.14.  The air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic.  How many phones do that?15.  Is the screen too large for one handed operation?  Yes, but so what?  The tradeoff is worth it.  Besides, Samsung now includes software to shrink it for one-handed so you get the best of both worlds. There are 2 things that Samsung needs to improve in my opinion.  I don't know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient  for users.  The Note 2 placement was better but still wrong.  (I do like the new speaker placement though.  Its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user).  This phone should also be waterproof right out-of-the-box.  Not a scaled-down version, just waterproof the thing.  Other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones.  That means Samsung can do it too.  Truth be known, we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof.  It's doable, so please do it.  Smoke it with that nano-whatever  waterproofing stuff.  You went to CES.  (Oh, and S voice is still sorry, use Google voice) All that said, I'm very, very, happy with the Note 3.  IMHO the Note 3 is so powerful and functional, it is the first device I would classify as a hand held computer.  As a professor, I researched it for days and used the original Galaxy Note for over a year now.  There are other good phones, but the Note 3 does it in one package, and in almost all cases does it better,  for the same flag-ship- phone price.  I feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising  hype who don't research the market.  They pay top dollar but don't get their money's worth.  Amazon is a great place to get your money's worth and to find out user information.  Thanks Amazon.Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it's a really good phone too.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome screen resolution, an excellent phablet", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID":

Check my video review for review of phone, some apps and GPS capability at the end. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone.  It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 2 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them. Phones don't get obsoleted. The previous gen phones still make phone calls and take great pictures as they did on day 1. Both Galaxy Note 2 and 3 have Micro-SIM. I have played around with a Note 3 and using on a regular basis and it is gorgeous phone in itself. The following paragraph applies to buying unlocked phones..DISPLAY: Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen.Note 3 has 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm (5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in) and weight 168 g (5.93 oz).Note 2 has Dimensions 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4 mm (5.95 x 3.17 x 0.37 in) and Weight: 183 g (6.46 oz).Note that it has become slightly less taller and 15 gm lighter! This is great as weight is a very important factor in handholding and for long uses. Both the phones have excellent S Pen stylus.Note 3 has 1920 x 1080 pixels, 5.7 inches (~386 ppi pixel density).Note 2 is 1280x720 pixels, 5.5 inches (~267 ppi pixel density). Note the superb increase in resolution. This is great as Note 3 has full HD finally. For comparison, Galaxy S4 has 5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display (441 ppi).MEMORY Both Note 3 and Note 2 has Card slot : microSD, up to 64 GB. Internal: 16/32/64 GB storage, Note 3 has 3 GB RAM whereas Note 2 has 2 GB RAM.WLAN: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band, DLNA (Both Note 2 and Note 3)Bluetooth: v4.0 with A2DP, LE, EDR (Both Note 2 and Note 3)NFC: Yes (both Note 2 and 3)USB: microUSB v3.0 (MHL 2), USB Host (Note 3, finally USB 3 on phones!)microUSB v2.0 (MHL), USB Host (Note 2)CAMERA:Note3: 13 MP, 4128 x 3096 pixels,autofocus, LED flash, Video 2160p@30fps, 1080p@60fps (Note 3, Note the substantially improved camera resolution)Note 2: Front: 8 MP, 3264x2448 pixels, video: 1080p@30fps, check quality; Back: 1.9 MPI feel for low light the camera did not perform well and this is an improvement I would like Samsung to make in low light sensors.Chipset:Note 3: Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400 (LTE model)/ Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 (3G model) Note 3 has Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 and if you see they have several technologies for different models.Note 2: Exynos 4412 Quad CPU: Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9 GPU: Mali-400MPSensors: Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometerGPS: with A-GPS support and GLONASSBATTERY: Li-Ion 3100 mAh battery (note 2) 3200 mAh (note 3)SAR (radiation level is often not considered in many reviews and it is an important level of comparison).SAR:Note 3 US Model: 0.55 W/kg (head) 1.49 W/kg (body)Note 3: EU Model: 0.21 W/kg (head)Note 2 US Model: 0.23 W/kg (head) 0.95 W/kg (body)Note that SAR ratings have increased for Note III version.Galaxy Note III is an awesome phone for its use cases. It is a delight for note taking purposes. I have used Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, Galaxy Tab 2/3 and I really love the Galaxy series. I can see the high end smartphones really getting saturated. For users with Note II or S4, I will not recommend upgrading unless you always want the latest and the greatest. You still have a great phone and it is not outdated just because Note III has come out. Your camera takes just great pictures as it did last month. Just like Detroit/Japan rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades. If you have a different phone or a low end phone or you are from that iSomething world, welcome to Galaxy series!Battery life is good.  The video playback was crisp. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs. I am not that annoyed with the Samsungware as I really like S-Health and some other apps. Mainly note taking apps are awesone.  People of course can root and put Cyanogenmod at some point later.I used to put a 64 GB microSDXC card SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging for video/song/ebooks.  I have since upgraded to 128 GB MicroSD and it works great! No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are: AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.Note III infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. Games were very buttery. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Smooth and Stunning display! NFC works awesome. I use a Qi charger with a Qi wireless receiver and they work great as well.Some Extra Accessories:NFC has lot of use cases. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAldiko Premium and Kindle Reading AppsAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoiceTemple Run series of gamesPlenty of WidgetsAPPENDIX: If you are comparing multiple phones, here is the quick highlevel breakdown of top phones as of mid 2014.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance.  External storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don't advertise or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version): 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.Ask questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy Note III. I will be glad to answer any questions.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone on the planet but lousy Simm locking policy by Samsung", "Author": "FALCON", "ReviewID": "R2UBFXKKHAC49X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "NOTE: I lowered my rating from 5 stars.  Samsung gets 0 stars, the phone gets 5 stars.The Note 3 is an awesome phone, but customers should be upset over  the SIMM lock on it, and NOT get this N9000 model.  This international version is not for US users or even US users who travel.If you are not a traveler forget the comments about it being region/SIMM locked, but you should buy the phone for your carrier.I still say 99.999% of all people who get the Note 3 could not care less if the international version is region locked.  However, this model, if you expect to use it in other countries has resulted in a thousand problems, literally. The phone is neutral but when it is activated the SIMM locks in the region and you cannot use it elsewhere.  Do not think \"unlocked\" means you have magical usage.  There is NO universal phone (except for spies), although some phones use other country SIMM cards -- but not this one!  I get a US carrier phone, travel internationally, and keep my phone in airplane mode and use WIFI or get a phone card.Do a search for XDA-Developers dot com, and go to the site.  (I do not want the link to get deleted) this is where the big boys and girls hang.Type in Galaxy Note 3 in the field for the phone you desire.In the Forums, go to galaxy note 3 general.Search down the page to the thread \"SIMM restrictions on unlocked European Note 3.\"  This thread has over 1300 posts.  Yes this is a big problem.Read the first half dozen pages and the last 10 pages, but also check especially posts 1041 through 1044, and pages 117 and 18.This phone is the international or European version, notice the N9000 number. It was released 2-3 weeks prior to the US versions, it is NOT LTE it is 3G; it has a different CPU -the Samsung Exynos 5 processor, not the Qualcom Snapdragon 800. US residents should not get it.  We need to get a phone activated for our respective carriers, which changes the last digit of the number. Search Amazon for the Note 3 with your carrier.  Notice the different last digit.Amazon may be confusing people by not listing the phone for what it really is and they need to change that in the title of the phone.  Their black version does say 'International\" in the title and so should this one.Now, down to business.First, I am not affiliated with Samsung in any way, nor do I work for a cell phone store.  I am a writer though.Secondly, I hate long reviews where the poster just reports the specs you already have.  Rather, these comments show why the Galaxy Note 3 is more technologically advanced, and more phone for your money, compared to the many good phones on the market today, and the not so good phones, like the cave phone (that's what I call it) that does nothing.1.  The beautiful  5.7\" Super Amoled HD display has a \"Wow!\"  factor.  Everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080P, 386 PPI.  Despite a few good contenders, no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color, and deep blacks.  Check it out for yourself.  For those who prefer drab, you can even adjust color intensity and contrast. Is this practical?  You bet.  You get more viewable data for all social networking apps;  you can see more email and contacts without scrolling; browsing is quick and pages more visible; YouTubes and video are fantastic; games are more playable; you can see larger areas on GPS maps;  you get a better view of radar in weather; (live) wallpapers look great; you can use it as a reader; you can multitask with it; and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it.  I will never go back to a small screen phone.2.  The CPU in the N9000 is the  Exynos 5 Octa 5420 which actually uses two quad core CPUs -- Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7.The CPU on the other versions based on the N9005 and N9002 and their carrier varients(which change the last digit of the model number to A, V, T, etc., per carrier) sold in the USA and elsewhere, is the quad core Qualcomm snapdragon 800 @ 2.3, which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time, and is slightly faster than the Exynos 5.  A few other phones have it.Either version performs with remarkable speed, and will do so for years to come.3.  The N9000 uses the Mali-T628 MP6 GPU, and it is impressively fast. The N9005 and N9002 units and their carrier varients use the Adreno 330 GPU which is slightly better than the Mali-T628 and is the best on the market as of this date.  It is 50% faster than the Adreno 320 in the Galaxy S4 which is a screamer.  A few other phones use these processors.4.  It's the only phone to come with 3 GB of DDR 3 RAM.  It also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage  and you can add more with an SD card.  Note: No extra charges for these!5.  It has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software, a BSI Sensor, Smart Digital Stabilization and high CRI LED.  Very few phones have this.  It is also the only phone to  do 4K video right now - sharp!6.  No other phone has USB 3.0.  2 advantages: the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable.  File transfer times are faster.  With USB 3.0, a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the Note 3 to my (high end) PC.  With USB 2.0 the same file takes 57 seconds.7.  How many phones have an S Pen?  Except for email and quick notes, I seldom used the S Pen on my original Galaxy Note, but the Note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional,  and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate.8.  How many phones have a huge 3200 mA battery?  It easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen.  Hardware and software improvements make the 100 mA bump over the Note 2 even more significant.  You can also open the back and change out the battery - unlike some phones.9.  It does infrared remote control.  It also has TV-out (via MHL  A/V link),  Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, and gesture sensor.  I'm serious people, you get more for your money.10.  Hello multitasking!  The fast CPU & GPU, extra memory, and high-resolution 5.7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone.  You can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen.  This is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth or USB, and connect through HDMI to your TV or computer monitor.  The Note 3 can actually serve as a small computer.  How many phones can do that?  You can also mirror the phone screen with your smart TV for internet, games, viewing pics, whatever.11.  This the best cell phone for gaming on the market , period.  The above features and OpenGL 3.0 which is part of Android 4.3 make it happen.  Don't believe me?  Read the reviews, watch the you tubes, and compared it for yourself.12.  It doesn't just have GPS, it also uses A GPS (improved), and Glonass Satellites.  DL a GPS satellite app, and you'll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location.13.  Got Knox?  No, you don't.  This phone provides business enterprise, and government level security for boot, VPN, etc., and comes in handy for privacy on public Wi-Fi.  You don't have to use it, but it is there.14.  The air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic.  How many phones do that?15.  Is the screen too large for one handed operation?  Yes, but so what?  The tradeoff is worth it.  Besides, Samsung now includes software to shrink it for one-handed so you get the best of both worlds. There are 3 things that Samsung needs to improve in my opinion.  I don't know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient  for users.  The Note 2 placement was better but still wrong.  (I do like the new speaker placement though.  Its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user).  This phone should also be waterproof right out-of-the-box.  Not a scaled-down version, just waterproof the thing.  Other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones.  That means Samsung can do it too.  Truth be known, we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof.  It's doable, so please do it.  Smoke it with that nano-whatever  waterproofing stuff.  You went to CES.  (Oh, and S voice is still sorry, use Google voice)  The speaker is plenty loud and similar to other smart phones, but it is not at all impressive like the rest of the phone.  IN fact, the sound is tinny.  Head phones sound fantastic though, so Samsung needs a better speaker in this phone. All that said, I'm very, very, happy with the Note 3.  IMHO the Note 3 is so powerful and functional, it is the first device I would classify as a hand held computer.  As a professor, I researched it for days and used the original Galaxy Note for over a year now.  There are other good phones, but the Note 3 does it in one package, and in almost all cases does it better,  for the same flag-ship- phone price.  I feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising  hype who don't research the market.  They pay top dollar but don't get their money's worth.  Amazon is a great place to get your money's worth and to find out user information.  Thanks Amazon.Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it's a really good phone too.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big Phone, Big Everything", "Author": "MrOodlesnNoodle", "ReviewID": "R17FRX42WRSKAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been wanting a Note phone since I last upgrade to a Samsung S2 two years ago. My friend and I picked up the Note 3 from TMobile here in America yesterday! It was very limited at certain stores. Now to the review.This phone has the highest and if not, tied for the highest spec for a smartphone out. 3GB of RAM, the closest phone has 2GB. The processor is tied with the Snapdragon 800 being used in a few high end Androids. The camera is amazing. Very clear and a lot of different options to chose from camera or recording. The screen resolution is amazing for a big phone. When I whip this bad boy out, it automatically catch peoples attention. You don't have to squint or zoom in. Things are that clear and big.Those are the pros. There are some cons, if you can call it that. My biggest complaint is - THERE ARE SOO MANY FEATURES & FUNCTIONS! I love this phone, don't get me wrong but I haven't had time to fully go through everything this phone has to offer. You can run 2 apps at the same time like Youtube and surf the internet. Name another phone or tablet that can do that? Take notes on a fly and have it sync with everything. This phone does it all but like I said, there's a lot to know about the phone which is a good and bad.The Note 3 is here to stay. The specs are up there so you won't need a replacement for a few years if you so choose. The battery life is ridiculous long. I left the house this morning with it full at 7:30 AM, have listened to music on my train ride back and forth, surfed the web and text my friends on and off. It is now 2:00 PM and my battery is like at 93%. I don't see how anyone can manage to drain this battery in 1 day if it wasn't intentional cause even with moderate use, that battery is lasting all day.I bought this device October 2, 2013 and if anyone has any question, please let me know and I'll gtt back to you as soon as possible", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Note - Notable", "Author": "Barredbard", "ReviewID": "R3CKV8EBV1U0ZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Note: This is an edit of my review of the Sprint version.First Appearances: Oh yes, the phone is notable, no question about it. It is huge, and while I realize that the size is the whole appeal for some there is no getting around the inconvenience of holding that 5.7 inch electronic mammoth to an ear for making a call. Which is its primary function, after all. I am no ogre; I have medium hands, and two-handed operations rule with this device. I am also digging my Jawbone Bluetooth headset out of retirement. This incarnation is actually both thinner and lighter than the Note 2. Still, I would have preferred a narrower, shorter phone, with the stylus. For now, I carry it in my coat pocket, while I wait for the slew of cases to hit the market. The phone features a faux leather backing with stitching all around it. It is tacky, but it works, and may even seem elegant from certain vantage points. It is better by leaps and bounds than the plastic looks of the Note 2. I have long disdained Samsung products for the simple reason that the company has no concept of style. Its phones - especially of late - actually have some really innovative ideas and groundbreaking software, but are housed in the cheapest-looking hardware to be found. Plastic is great for toothbrushes and combs. Not so much for mobile phones.The hardware: The Note 3 comes in either 32GB or 64GB. I opted for the former since, unlike Apple's monopolistic tendencies, Samsung permits users to add an SD card up to 64 GB for extra capacity. The box comes with some a white set of headphones which work quite well for making and taking calls. However, thanks to Samsung's thoughtlessness, I will not be using it for work since the color is rather loud. The set itself features a very powerful 13 megapixel camera, and a front-facing 2 megapixel camera for chats and self-portraits. It also features several convenience buttons embedded in silver on the device: a volume button, a power button which can also be used to silence the phone, and a home button. The USB 3.0 jack is somewhat disconcerting since at first blush it looks like it is incompatible with a regular micro USB cord. But never fear, a standard micro USB cord will charge the phone, albeit at a lesser speed than the included USB 3.0 cord. Depress the home button twice, and Samsung's Siri junior will be ready to take orders. It is not as sassy or as useful as Siri on the iPhone, but I do not regret the divorce. As promised, technical details are not discussed at any length, but the phone is blazing fast.The battery: This deserves its very own section, as this is one area where this phone truly excels. A cellphone is only as good as its battery. The iPhone 5 was a bitter disappointment for me. 6 hours of moderate use was enough to drain the battery to the point that charging was necessary. In fairness, my experience does not appear to be typical, since two co-workers can go all day on their iPhones. Sprint's lackluster network connection means that my phones constantly search for network connection, especially indoors, and I imagine that wreaks havoc on the battery. The Note 3 cannot be beaten for battery life on the Sprint network. I only need to charge it after 12 to 15 hours of moderate to heavy use; enough for complete liberation from a charger while at work. This feature is critical for me; a lawyer must have a device with a powerful enough battery to survive a day spent in court away from the office.The software: Samsung has matured as a software developer. Although many of its software applications and innovations on the phone appear little more than gimmicks, the Note 3 is replete with a profusion of software that a user will doubtlessly appreciate. The camera comes in many clever modes. There's the Knox application which either allows the IT department at any office to isolate office information from personal information, or which just allows the user to deposit media files and such to a secured location that requires a password for access. There's the screen mirroring which allows one to `mirror' anything on the Note 3's screen on a different device like on a computer monitor or flat screen TV. There's the remote control application that permits the user to quickly and easily program the phone to serve as a remote for all electronic devices including the cable box, DVD/Blue Ray Player and TV. The remote application even allows different remotes within the application for different rooms. Flicking a finger from the bottom of the phone upwards presents an amalgamation of news events. Waving a hand over the phone while it is sleeping reveals stats such as the time, missed phone calls, emails and texts; a subtle enhancement. Depressing a tab to the right of the screen produces a menu from which a user can select two seperate apps for simultaneous viewing. Using this feature, for example, one can fire off an email browsing the internet, or watching a youtube video on the same screen at the same time. The tab can be moved to the left of the screen if it proves to obtrusive, or can be gotten rid of all together by pressing the back button.The Stylus: The stylus, for me, is not a gimmick. I am forgetful, and jotting down quick notes on my phone is an added boon. Pulling out the pen activates the `Air Command' feature; a fan shaped menu that presents a variety of options, to wit: Action memo, Scrap booker, Screen Write, S-finder and Pen Window. Action memo had the most potential, but Samsung crippled it by not allowing the flexibility to manipulate notes in any manner. For example, writing down a number and name will allow you to save it contacts. Writing down an email address will allow you to quicky send an email to that address. But I cannot write a quick note, cut and paste it into an email, and fire it off. For that, I would need the 'S Note' application which is a much better option from a practical standpoint, but which is not featured in the Air Command menu.Advantages: The main advantages this phone enjoys over the iPhone particularly are: 1) Removable battery, which is not to be taken lightly; it is disheartening to find so many makers towing Apple's line and making batteries that cannot be removed from the phone. This eliminates the option of swopping the battery if it becomes weak or if it is drained during travel; 2) A standard micro USB will charge it; 3) An SD card will increase its capacity. An added advantage (over other phones, but not the iPhone) is its potential use as an international phone. There was a brief scare when it appeared that Samsung had hamstrung the device by only making it usable in the region purchased. For Samsung, this would have been equivalent to purchasing a high caliber pistol, taking careful aim, and shooting itself in the foot. Samsung has since clarified that it only requires that the phone be first activated in the region that it was purchased, and then it would be possible to use SIM cards from other regions. This fact still generates resentment, as it should, since when one purchases a phone, one expects to be able to use it wherever he or she pleases. Another annoyance is that after hitting 'talk' in answering a call, the device still asks whether you will accept the call or send it to voice mail. This unexpected step has caused me to miss a few calls, and I have yet to figure out how to deactivate it.Final Impressions: The phone handles calls with clarity and is blazingly fast. It is by no means 'the Blackberry experience' I previously described. Until Samsung learns that consumers like both form and function in a device, it will never maximize its full potential. Their devices have been entirely lacking the appeal that would render their devices the iconic artifacts that iPhones are. The Note 3 is close to being an exception to the rule; as garish as its fake leather might seem, it is still the best looking of their devices. My main gripe is the sheer size of the phone. Most would appreciate a more manageable form factor, narrower in width and perhaps shorter in length.The Bottom line: The Note has matured into a flagship phone, able to take in corporate and personal life with equal alacrity. Its powerful and removable battery will make it a favorite choice of intrepid travelers, and its huge screen allows it to bridge a gap previously unnoticed between phones and tablets. I would have rated it at 4.5 but that option seems unavailable. I will edit this article in days to come.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome screen resolution, an excellent phablet", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R1ZJG80TOMYEOP", "Overall": "5.0",

Check my video review for review of phone, some apps and GPS capability at the end. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone.  It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 2 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them. Phones don't get obsoleted. The previous gen phones still make phone calls and take great pictures as they did on day 1. Both Galaxy Note 2 and 3 have Micro-SIM. I have played around with a Note 3 and using on a regular basis and it is gorgeous phone in itself. The following paragraph applies to buying unlocked phones..DISPLAY: Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen.Note 3 has 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm (5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in) and weight 168 g (5.93 oz).Note 2 has Dimensions 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4 mm (5.95 x 3.17 x 0.37 in) and Weight: 183 g (6.46 oz).Note that it has become slightly less taller and 15 gm lighter! This is great as weight is a very important factor in handholding and for long uses. Both the phones have excellent S Pen stylus.Note 3 has 1920 x 1080 pixels, 5.7 inches (~386 ppi pixel density).Note 2 is 1280x720 pixels, 5.5 inches (~267 ppi pixel density). Note the superb increase in resolution. This is great as Note 3 has full HD finally. For comparison, Galaxy S4 has 5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display (441 ppi).MEMORY Both Note 3 and Note 2 has Card slot : microSD, up to 64 GB. Internal: 16/32/64 GB storage, Note 3 has 3 GB RAM whereas Note 2 has 2 GB RAM.WLAN: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band, DLNA (Both Note 2 and Note 3)Bluetooth: v4.0 with A2DP, LE, EDR (Both Note 2 and Note 3)NFC: Yes (both Note 2 and 3)USB: microUSB v3.0 (MHL 2), USB Host (Note 3, finally USB 3 on phones!)microUSB v2.0 (MHL), USB Host (Note 2)CAMERA:Note3: 13 MP, 4128 x 3096 pixels,autofocus, LED flash, Video 2160p@30fps, 1080p@60fps (Note 3, Note the substantially improved camera resolution)Note 2: Front: 8 MP, 3264x2448 pixels, video: 1080p@30fps, check quality; Back: 1.9 MPI feel for low light the camera did not perform well and this is an improvement I would like Samsung to make in low light sensors.Chipset:Note 3: Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400 (LTE model)/ Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 (3G model) Note 3 has Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 and if you see they have several technologies for different models.Note 2: Exynos 4412 Quad CPU: Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9 GPU: Mali-400MPSensors: Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometerGPS: with A-GPS support and GLONASSBATTERY: Li-Ion 3100 mAh battery (note 2) 3200 mAh (note 3)SAR (radiation level is often not considered in many reviews and it is an important level of comparison).SAR:Note 3 US Model: 0.55 W/kg (head) 1.49 W/kg (body)Note 3: EU Model: 0.21 W/kg (head)Note 2 US Model: 0.23 W/kg (head) 0.95 W/kg (body)Note that SAR ratings have increased for Note III version.Galaxy Note III is an awesome phone for its use cases. It is a delight for note taking purposes. I have used Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, Galaxy Tab 2/3 and I really love the Galaxy series. I can see the high end smartphones really getting saturated. For users with Note II or S4, I will not recommend upgrading unless you always want the latest and the greatest. You still have a great phone and it is not outdated just because Note III has come out. Your camera takes just great pictures as it did last month. Just like Detroit/Japan rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades. If you have a different phone or a low end phone or you are from that iSomething world, welcome to Galaxy series!Battery life is good.  The video playback was crisp. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs. I am not that annoyed with the Samsungware as I really like S-Health and some other apps. Mainly note taking apps are awesone.  People of course can root and put Cyanogenmod at some point later.I used to put a 64 GB microSDXC card SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging for video/song/ebooks.  I have since upgraded to 128 GB MicroSD and it works great! No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are: AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.Note III infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. Games were very buttery. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Smooth and Stunning display! NFC works awesome.

Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance.  External storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice.

Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.Ask questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy Note III.

I thought it was a near perfect phablet, except for just two main areas for improvement: Screen resolution/sunlight legibility, and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed. Now that I have the Note 3, things are much much improved.Lets make this review simple and straight to the point, with a few comparisons to other phones:PROS:1) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen. And WOW, what a screen it is!There are a handful of improvements:* The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p(from the Note 2's 720p). You can noticeably tell that it is crisper.* You will also find out that it is a lot brighter. This screen has been technically measured to be the brightest screen of any phone, and just now bested by the Samsung Galaxy S5. For us geeks, that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max(as tested by DisplayMate).* Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2. The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels(velvety deep blacks). I can finally use it in the bright sunlight now!* Touch input response is lightning quick. This means when you touch something, it responses nearly instantaneously. It even beats the iPhone 5S, the previous champion, and is only just bested by the HTC One M8.2) This phone flies, almost literally. The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag, and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart's content! This phone is AWESOME for gaming.3) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note. Too much to describe all the functions, and you can do without it for most functions. But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4) All those software features! Granted, you can do without most of them for day-to-day things, but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use. The are also too many to go through all - there are literally over 30 features! One of my favorites is the Smart-Stay feature, which uses the front camera to monitor that you're looking at the screen and won't dim/turn off, which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages, etc., holding the phone up with one hand, and your other hand is pre-occupied. No more having to shuffle your hand and risk dropping the phone to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up. This is especially and specifically useful for me when I'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app. Also, there are tilt and hand-gesture features for when you want to scroll web pages, emails, zoom in on photos, switch to the next or previous photo or music track, answer a phone call, etc. etc. etc!5) The sound is noticeably louder as well. It doesn't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One's dual stereo speakers, but by itself it is louder. This is useful when you are in a noisy environment, and having one loud mono speaker is more useful than having two expansive speakers that space the sound out wider and making it harder to hear. As good as the HTC One sounds, I hate that for most things like music and video, it is so darn soft and frustrating. I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use. Although the new HTC One M8 has much improved and louder speakers than the older M7.6) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it, and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I'm in bed at night. The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME. I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20% will already be gone. And when I charge it, it trickle charges like a turtle! With the Note 3, being able to replace the battery is an added plus, and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly, usually from 20% to full charge in about 2.5 hours. But even these two advantages cannot compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place. from about 10am to 2am, with heavy usage, I usually end the night at about 30%, which is actually quite amazing since I am on it constantly - phone calls, checking emails, web surfing, checking sports stats and news, and spending hours using my Pulse News app.CONS:*There are few things you can nitpick, like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy, not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones. The plastic back nice a nice leathery LOOK, but it is still cheap plastic and feels just like it. Thank goodness most of us cover our phones with cases, so in that aspect it's not a big deal, just that for a $700 phone it should have been made with much better materials and craftsmanship. With rumors of a new Galaxy luxury line, this may be changed very soon though.*The Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. There is a minute, but noticeable lag when you open certain apps or switch between apps with the multi-tasker. Luckily, being Android means we'll never have to settle. My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look, is Smart Launcher Pro. Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I can't think of much else really to fault this phone, except for the fact that simply for what it is: It's a niche machine that's half tablet/half phone - it will not satisfy you as a tablet replacement(I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range), and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it in one hang, and do all the things you need one-handed(I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S). But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is, then there is no better alternative, period. Samsung dominates the phablet market, and that's because this is a nearly flawless multimedia machine with an excellent, crisp, brilliant screen, powerful hardware, useful software, and AWESOME battery life.

The page to the left of the home screen starts off with a 3-line deep full screen-width app that counts your steps.  I don't know why a step-counting app needs to take up almost a full page, but it does.  There are all sorts of apps that are integrated in which duplicate or even triplicate each other's functions and it's impossible to get rid of the ones you don't want or aren't using.  Samsung even has this duplicate app store because it can't be bothered to put its regular apps in the regular Android store, so you have to manage two app stores with the other apps you bought on whatever Android phone you had before this one.  Evernote and that Flip program both keep updating and will keep notifying you that you need more updates, even if you try to shut them off.  There's a messaging app that, if you get AT&T;, will be tied into your phone number and, even if you use Google Voice, will duplicate all your text messages, so you'll get double dings whenever you get a text message.If you press the home button too long or it thinks you double pressed it, you get this MyMagazine app popup and it's impossible to turn that off or stop it from happening (and again with the apps which duplicate or triplicate each others functions, there are several other social/news-aggregating apps on the phone that you can't get rid of)..  The stylus is great, but you can't change the apps that open in Pen Window.  So, even though Evernote and Samsung have announced a \"deeper partnership\", you have to take extra steps to open Evernote instead of the memo app in the pen window, which I tried to do for the first week before I gave up and tried to shut that app off.  Its the same with most of the air command functions, there's just no way to really customize it and actually make it useful instead of going with the apps that Samsung *thinks* we all want.About a month after I received the phone, it stopped working.  My warranty company, SquareTrade, didn't want to repair it because they said it was supposed to be under warranty from Samsung.  Samsung USA doesn't recognize the IMEI number.  They transferred me to Samsung Canada who didn't recognize the IMEI.  HeavyDuty Electronics is apparently not an authorized retailer.  Because the phone is from Vietnam, I went to the Samsung Vietnam website at [...]number on the phone either.  After a few months, I finally got SquareTrade to repair it.  When I received it back, they'd reset everything and it worked, but only for about a month again.  I don't know if it's the region locking that Samsung put into this supposedly unlocked phone or what, but the phone apparently just bricks itself after about a month of use.Both times, I tried putting a new battery in and the phone wouldn't start.  Both times the new battery was working in another Note 3 before I tried the battery swap and both times the new battery still worked in another Note 3 afterward, but wouldn't work in this one, so it's not a battery issue.  Multiple chargers plugged in won't keep it charged, so it's not a charger issue.  And last time SquareTrade just reset it and sent back the same phone/battery, so it seems to be an internal trigger that won't let it charge and keeps it quiescent.I think the seller stole these phones, which is why no Samsung subsidiary seems to have a record of the IMEI, and why the phone apparently bricks itself after about a month of use.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Note 3 N900. Read if: you're an iPhone user and/or confused about the whole regional lock issue", "Author": "A. Assaad", "ReviewID": "R35GDM5400CG3F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, it's important to note that I migrated from an iPhone 5, I have been an iPhone user for 3 years (had the 4, 4S and 5) and a mac user for 5 years, I also have an iPad, therefore it's safe to assume that I have heavily invested in Apple's ecosystem. In ways I do miss my iPhone (I still have it, haven't let it go just yet), but in other ways I don't. More on that later.REGIONAL LOCK:But before I talk about my post-iOS experience, I'd like to make one thing clear about the regional lock. I have researched this issue extensively before buying my Note 3 as I travel around a lot and need to use different SIM cards, so I directly contacted different sellers on amazon to make sure the phone is truly unlocked, and i ended up buying it from \"Mercate Group\" after confirming with them that the phone doesn't have a regional lock. I tried a US AT&T; sim card and an Egyptian sim card and they're both working fine. I always prefer to buy from sellers that are fulfilled by Amazon (if the product isn't offered by amazon themselves), because if there are any issues, you're just one amazon CS phone call away from solving the problem. Amazon have an exceptional customer service. So conclusion: most phones come with a regional lock now but apparently Samsung realized that it will backfire on their behinds. Solution: contact the seller before you buy the phone.WHY I MIGRATED FROM iPHONE, WHAT I MISS, WHAT I DON'T:Well, as I mentioned earlier, I've heavily invested in Apple's ecosystem and I have to admit that their ecosystem is simply amazing, the seamless integration between your mac, iPad and iPhone, iCloud, restoring backups is an easy process, etc.. Then I really started getting bored of iOS and its lack of customizability, also the iPhone's small screen, especially when I first saw the Note 3 and put my iPhone next to it; the note basically dwarfed the iPhone. I do a lot of reading on my phone and the bigger screen does all the difference. Now you're thinking \"but what about one-handed operation?\", well I have fairly big hands so it doesn't bother me as much, I can still text while driving (let's face it, we all do it) and samsung has an item in their settings called \"one handed operation\" just for that. But if you're a person with small hands and plan on using it one handed, that will be impossible.WHAT I MISS IN MY iPHONE-iMessage, FaceTime, iCloud and most of all: iTunes.I didn't truly appreciate iTunes until I had to use Samsung Kies (Samsung's equivalent for iTunes). Think of the Kies as a punishment rather than a software solution. It's Samsung's way of punishing you for all the sins they assume you've done. It's painful to use and it's the biggest reason why I miss my iPhone. I have all my music on iTunes and it's such a shame that I have to use drag and drop to transfer music to my Note 3 like it's 2002 or something.-Music and photo viewing: iOS' music interface is like no other, it's the best in the business and no one will ever take away that from them. End of. iOS 7 has a great timeline when it comes to the gallery too.WHAT I DON'T MISS IN MY IPHONE-The screen: albeit slightly oversaturated, the Note 3's screen is simply unparalleled, I can do a lot of reading and not feel eye strain-The battery: the note 3's battery is slightly better (it's a bigger battery but it's an octa core phone with a mammoth screen)-The lack of customizability: this is android's strongest point and there are endless widgets and ways in which you can make the phone suit your needs-Restricted sharing: let's say you wanna send a photo using whatsapp; in iOS, you need to do it through whatsapp whereas in android you can do it directly from gallery. Yes, in iOS you can share a photo directly from gallery but only by mail or iMessage or AirDrop aka the ways Apple WANT you to use, because they want to trap you in their ecosystem.I will not go into details when it comes to the note 3 itself, many other reviews covered that extensively. But in all, the phone is smooth, has a beautiful screen, camera is good although the iPhone's camera is faster, S-pen is useful but you won't use it as much as you think. Has nice features you probably won't need (air gestures, smart scroll, etc..) they're nice to have but meh.I've only had the phone for 2 weeks so I'm still yet to decide if I'll completely let go of my iPhone or not.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this phone if you are living oversea!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RG5GYAAK13XLV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Awesome phone, just can not use it overseas.

At first, I thought is would not be a problem. It has been two weeks and still cannot get the phone to work. I went to local Samsung service center and they were absolutely clueless. I called USA Samsung tech support, they said sorry, we can't help you, you have to see your carrier. I told them my phone does not have a carrier associated with it. I did go to several local carriers but that was fruitless. After further research on the intenet, I found out that the first SIM card you put in the phone has to be from the region you bought the phone. Really? I did not see that anywhere in manuals. So Samsung, what should I do? Hop on a plane from western Africa go to the United States to unlock my phone, and that's not even guaranteed because I have already put a foreign carrier SIM card in the phone which makes it even harder to unlock the phone.

Believe it or not, the N9005 Snapdragon 800 version does not respond as fast as this N900 Octacore version.

Battery life is also longer on this N900 version. I can live with out 4k video...1080p video and 13 megapixel stills that are as good as some point and shoot cameras will do just fine.  Lastly, while its true that the N900 model does not have LTE, 3G speeds and HSPA+ are sufficient any Youtube, Pandora etc. You can't even get the LTE version that works in the U.S. unlocked on Amazon (only the carriers have those)...the other LTE version on Amazon will only work on LTE frequencies in Europe, which are different from those in the U.S. of A. So in short, if you want a good clean unlocked Note 3 that will work in the U.S. without any \"Regional SIM lock\" issues, get the N900 version.

I thought it was a near perfect phablet, except for just two main areas for improvement: Screen resolution/sunlight legibility, and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed. Now that I have the Note 3, things are getting very very interesting....Lets do this review by bulletin points for easier viewing:PROS:1) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen. There are a handful of improvements:  * The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p(from 720p). You can noticeably tell that it is crisper.  * You will also find out that it is a bit brighter. For us geeks, that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max(when auto brightness is turned on).  * Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2. However, it is still not as good as the HTC One's screen. The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels(velvety deep blacks). As a whole however, and because of its Pentile pixel system, it comes just a bit short of the HTC One's Super LCD 3. It is really nitpicking though, so you won't ever regret this.2) This phone flies, almost literally. The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag, and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart's content!3) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note. Too much to describe all the functions, and you can do without it for most functions. But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4) All those software features! Granted, you can do without most of them for day-to-day things, but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use. The are also too many to go through all, I but what I love most is the Smart-Stay, which uses the front camera to monitor that you're looking at the screen and won't dim/turn off, which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages, etc., holding the phone up with one hand, and your other hand is pre-occupied. No more having to shuffle around to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up. This is especially and specifically useful for me when I'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app.5) The sound is noticeably louder as well. It doesn't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One's dual stereo speakers, but by itself it is louder. This is useful when you are in a noisy environment, and having one loud speaker is more useful than having two immersive speakers that are softer and harder to hear. As good as the HTC One sounds, I hate that for most things like music and video, it is so darn soft and frustrating. I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use.6) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it, and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I'm in bed at night. The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME. I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20% will already be gone. And when I charge it, it trickle charges like a turtle! With the Note 3, being able to replace the battery is an added plus, and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly. But even these two advantages cannot compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place.CONS:There are few things you can nitpick, like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy, not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones. With rumors of a new Galaxy line, this may be changed very soon though. Also, the Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. Luckily, being Android means we'll never have to settle. My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look, is Smart Launcher Pro. Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I can't think of much else really to fault this phone, except for the fact that simply for what it is: It's a niche machine that's half tablet/half phone - it will never satisfy you as a tablet replacement(I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range), and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it, and do all the things you need one-handed(I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S). But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is, then there is no better alternative. This is a nearly flawless phablet with an brilliant screen, powerful hardware, useful software, and awesome battery life.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I ... LOVE ... THIS ...

The model of the phone that I have is N900T (black).No doubt the phone is great and loaded with a lot of bells and whistles. In the end though, the fundamentals of a smartphone must take preeminence. By the fundamentals of a smartphone, I mean the following.1. Call qualities, setting options, and features.2. Messaging of all sorts, including emails, SMS/MMS, social networks, and other messengers - setting options and features.3. Web-browsing, including choice of browsers, setting options, and features.4. Camera, including still images and videos - qualities, setting options, and features5. Seamless integration of the above and smoothness of operation.6. BATTERY LIFE!!!!!1. Samsung did a very good job with the call aspect of the phone. But the options they have for call rejection is still very rudimentary. I have resorted to more full-featured third party applications to do that for me. I expected Samsung to make this feature more robust and include options like blacklist, white-list, scheduling when to begin and end call rejection, the option to include or exclude any group of contact/numbers in auto-reject mode, the option to use matching criteria when activating call rejection, the option to automatically send an SMS to a caller when the phone is in auto-reject mode - just to name a few.2. There is a lot you can do with the features provided in the messaging app for SMS/MMS. But I use Go-SMS Pro more often as that seems to be more feature-loaded. It will be too much to list all the details of how certain third party messaging apps trump the stock SMS messaging app on the Note 3, but at the very least I expected that this phone will have the option of a popup window for new message notifications. That way, you can send a reply right away without going into the messaging app first. We could also have the option to create private folders and have any SMS/MMS of our choice tucked away from the eyes of the public, only accessible via a pass-code pf some sort.3. My favorite browsers have been Chrome and Dolphin. The stock Samsung browser is good, but it has some catching up to do. Thankfully, Chrome is native to the phone.4. The camera of the phone is one of the best you can find on a smartphone. But it lags behind in many respects: image stabilization; shutter time (I think the Iphone still has the fastest shutter time of all phone cameras that I've seen), 13 megapixel at a time when the minimum standard is 16 megapixel (and Nokia already has phone cameras with upwards of 20 megapixel), and low-light performance.5. Integration of all parts and functions of the phone is seamless. No complaints about that. But the occasional freezing, overheating, and lag is inexcusable for a phone with 3GB of RAM and a quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor clocked at 2.3Ghz. With respect to smooth operation, I found my Galaxy Note 2 to be of better performance.6. You would think that with a 3200mAh battery, the note 3 would out-last the Note  2 in battery life; but in reality, the Note 2 does better. For the life of me, I don't understand why I should turn off all the features that make the Note 3 a smartphone just to make the battery last all day. Why should I sacrifice performance and state-of-the-art functionality just to make my phone's battery life last all day? I've read reviews in which people have bragged about how eternal the Note 3 battery life is; and now I ask myself: have they been talking about the Note 3 or something else? I have a lot of power-consuming features disabled on my Note 3 and it still cannot match the Note 2 when it comes to battery life. This aspect of the phone is indeed disappointing. I think a two-prong approach is required here to fix this now or in the future: software optimization and a bigger battery. There is a 6400mAh after-market battery available for the Note 3; why didn't Samsung give us this or something close to it to begin with? It would not be an earthshaking step-forward for Samsung to take. I buy a smartphone for its features and it is silly for Samsung to expect me to furn off the features that attracted me to the phone just to make the battery last. Indeed no phone may be called a smartphone if its battery can't last all day while using the features that ought to make the phone smart.The other aspects of the phone such as Smart Stay, Smart Scroll, and Smart Pause are really in the alpha/beta stage of development. Samsung needs to work on those. At best, their performance is unreliable and very hiccupy.Now, don't give me the meaningless rebuttal I often hear: it's an android phone; you can app it up and use any aftermarket battery of your choice; you can even root it and do whatever you like with it. True, but this is no excuse for Samsung not to make ths nearly $800 device completely topnotch through and through.Having said the foregoing, I should reluctantly submit that this phone truly deserves to be called the best smartphone on earth today. It's hardware specs are topnotch; no other phone has up to half of the plethora of bells and whistles with which Samsung has blessed this phone; the S-pen and its associated apps and functions are another awesome set of packages, not to mention the phone's capacity for 4K video recording. Then you have the provision for a micro-SD card and a removable battery. The phone is equipped with USB 3.0, Bluetooth 4.0, and IR capability for controlling your TV. Lest I forget the number one attraction for me; the screen is gorgeously massive.

This would keep happening, at random intervals, and to seemingly random brightness levels. If I continued still to use it... say after 45 minutes or something, it would dim to MINIMUM brightness for few seconds.Now, it wouldn't show me or tell me in any way what brightness level it was changing to... I could just tell when it was putting to MINIMUM brightness. I got it replaced for another Note 3... The replacement had same issue... I called Verizon Wireless and then they revealed to me that this was a feature built into device by the manufacturer.

I haven't tried doing an OTA update yet but I imagine it would work. Still one star for wanting to punish people who want to use their device.The phone itself is great. It's fast, it's slick, lots of storage what's not to like? Well, the manufacturers want to make it harder and harder to run custom roms and acquire root on your device.Here is a secret - root should not void your warranty. That would be like Dell denying a warranty on the simple basis that I wiped Windows and installed Linux (ignoring the fact that Dell does support Linux on a select number of, hidden, systems). (Update: or Dell denying warranty because I reset the password for the local Windows administrator account that I didn't have access to). Yes, installing new ROMs and flashing can brick the device, but Samsung, or any manufacture, should have a device to repair it if something goes wrong. If they don't then I would be highly suspect of their talent as people have been unbricking devices for years using JTAG. I understand that it falls out what normal operations would be - so charge a small fee (~$20) if you have to repair a bricked device due to rooting/flashing. Or an even better idea is a big red button that flashes everything back to factory specs (password protected naturally).In any case, whenever I get a new device I always get root. Not for nefarious reasons, but mainly because certain applications, like my one time password generators don't have a sync option so the only way to get them to a new device is to use titanium backup which requires root. Also, I use titanium backup to freeze the bloat that comes on the phone (seriously samsung?). This way they can't run and don't show up for updates. Low and behold, once I acquired root the updater said \"my device was modified so you cannot have future updates\". What the f is that??? Seriously. What middle manager decided that was a good idea? Instead why don't you say \"look, you modified your device, this update may break your phone, are you sure you really want to check for updates?\" Just let me accept the risk - god knows apparently you will do anything to snake out of repairing the device if a hardware failure actually happened.That's my rant and hopefully my review will convince power users to steer clear of this phone.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "We had a little problem, but the solution came really fast!", "Author": "Anna Lino", "ReviewID": "R249SLNUM93KK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was supposed to receive the pink note 3 on friday, but it didn't come.

First of all, the phone has many bugs, the software is very buggy and the battery don't last as long as people are describing it. Second, despite having the latest processor and 3gb of RAM, i have noticed the phone hesitates at times, and applications take a lil bit to load or complete processes. Third, and i realize this is a software issue, the phone leaves all apps open and running on the background, and that consumes huge amounts of memory and resources, also decreases the battery life considerably. Fourth, the sound on this device is plain simple Mediocre!!, the botom speaker produces awful sound quality and very low volume, that' to me is unacceptable for a $700 phone. Expect some heat when working with the phone, and don't get to excited about the apps and \"cool features\" since they do not work in real life like they do on commercials. The only relatively good thing about this phone, and doesn't work up to its potential due to big software bugs is the screen, the screen produces beautiful colors and very high brightness, the problem is that even with the auto screen brightness and all the other fueatures that have to do with it off, the phone still dims the screen while you're working with it, and i've read online that it is due to an internal sensor that detects the temperature of the phone, and dims the screen to lower the tem, that is the most annoying thing i've ever experienced with a device.And finally, the phone interface looks like a toy, i don't know if i percieve  this because i got used to the HTC one sence interface which in my opinion is the cleanest and better looking among many high end phone out there.Conclusion, if you really wanna get this phone and try it out, do it and always see if you can return it to the seller in case you don't like it, which is very likely if you prefer a cleaner and better phone. I think that people who get this phone rate it good, becuase on their minds they are trying to justify why they spent $700 on a phone that performs and has bugs like this one.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really nice phone with some major flaws!!", "Author": "gadgetboy", "ReviewID": "RZ3FO5IMD657C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So, this is suppose to be the best phone Samsung have to offer.

When I received it, it wouldn't activate. The SIM card number wasn't on the order. I had to pry the SIM card out of the Note 3, which is NOT an easy thing to do! I had to do this to read the SIM card number to Verizon Wireless, so they could activate it.I noticed that when I had device on maximum brightness (NOT on \"Automatic\") and was working on something over extended amount of time, the brightness would dim for a few seconds, then return to max. This would keep happening, at random intervals, and to seemingly random brightness levels. If I continued still to use it... say after 45 minutes or something, it would dim to MINIMUM brightness for few seconds.Now, it wouldn't show me or tell me in any way what brightness level it was changing to... I could just tell when it was putting to MINIMUM brightness. I got it replaced for another Note 3... The replacement had same issue... I called Verizon Wireless and then they revealed to me that this was a feature built into device by the manufacturer. I even spoke to Samsung to verify this.So, stay away from the Galaxy Note 3 at ALL COSTS! ANYONE that owned this device might need to operate the device on maximum brightness for extended amount of time... I mean, why have a long life battery, quad core cpu, and 3 gb RAM, if you can't fully utilize them? So, this phone does this to prevent overheating.

Search the web for Galaxy Note 3 SIM Restrictions and you will see why. It seems these phones are region-locked by Samsung as an attempt to prevent grey-market imports. The phones are blocked from using SIMs from other regions - e.g. if you buy a Note 3 in Europe, you can't use a Chinese local SIM when traveling in China. Many people do this sort of thing to avoid heinous roaming charges.Samsung have stated that if the first SIM you use with the phone is one from the \"home region\" of the handset then the region lock is automatically lifted. However, there have been several posts from users on the web who have stated this is not the case. These users have been blocked from using local SIMs even though they had first \"activated\" their handset with an in-region SIM before traveling.My advice is do not buy this handset if you think you will ever need to use it abroad without paying roaming charges to your home carrier.(Thanks to Simon Jerrie for the heads-up).", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "partyguy1983", "Author": "partyguy1983", "ReviewID": "R2YBV29C5B0KL1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this is the greatest phone I've ever had.

It is a great phone, but it has a giant problem; you cannot put it in your pocket or bag without turning it on. Not only is the big home button not recessed, but it sticks up. This will seriously drain your battery and cause the phone to heat-up in your pocket.Worse yet, if you turn off the lock screen, when the home button gets pressed it will run apps, dial phone numbers, enable the phone, etc. etc. etc. One guy's phone kept dialing 911.Battery life will be significantly reduced each time the home button is inadvertently pressed. This can literally keep your phone on for the entire day if you move around. Some users have purchased cases that snap onto your belt to fix this problem. Some of the cases have the same problem when the phone is snapped-in or the lid is flipped over it. This problem really sucks!I tried to send an email to Samsung, but their website will not let you drill down far enough to submit a request for tech support. What is that all about? I finally was able to contact a person through their chat feature, but they simply said that there is no fix. The person said that she would route my problem to the engineers.There actually is a very simple fix that is posted on the internet, but it requires rooting the phone. There is one file that has a line with the word \"wake\" in it for the home button. If you take the word out, it is fixed. It is so simple, it is ridiculous. Why hasn't Samsung fixed this with a simple settings parameter? The problem started with the Note 2. I will not root my phone and void my warranty. Actually, I am seriously considering returning my phone within the 14 day trial period.If you can live with your phone being on most of the time, or can find a case that does not hit this button, then the phone is great.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awful", "Author": "Mortar and Pestle", "ReviewID": "R2PR64BHFTE10J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this device at AT&T; store, lured by all the bells and whistles, but mostly the size I desperately wanted.

Moving or action pictures? Blurred mostly but neither phone could take the place of a dedicated camera. The apps for the iPhone are much smarter and user friendly. The only aspect i find the note 3 prevailing over the iphone 4s is the blue tooth. It doesn't link up every time I get in the car like it should but it will link up where the iPhone can be fussy. As for the hard wear both are exceptional but the iPhone tiny screen is a deal breaker. I could go on and nit pick the note 3 since I've put it in the hands of other Android owners that find that the note 3 OS lacks even by their expectations. Here is a short listA) the home button should bring up last operation with a double click allowing for switching back and fourth.UPDATE hold the home button rather than X2 click the buttonB) the spell check is harsh and often as stupid as the speller. Nothing but an aggravating chore is guaranteed when trying to override the note 3s determation. Also keep in mind the android spell ck app is crap when compared with the iTunes spell ck.UPDATE the kit kat update has fix it.C) the iPhone is built for people with a task in mind while the note 3 is built for people have ample time to \"train\" a phone.D) iCloud keeps up-loaded pictures nice and tidy ready to scroll through while the note 3 cloud is a \"trippy mess\" literallyUPDATE KitKat update fix thisE) my verdict on the note 3 voice command is still out but I'll guess note 3 has the upper hand. UPDATE the voice command is near flawlessF) while iPhone will drop down a list of recent Google entries the note 3 only list 3 random entries UPDATE it lists the 3 most popular searchesG) I agree with the review that posted that when the phone warms up from direct sun light it stops responding.H) the battery easily last just as long as the iPhone but iPhone owners can buy a battery case that will add 4200 ma easily out lasting the note 3s battery with the added bonus that when the battery case plug gets crappy from months of plugging in to charge the case can be tossed and replacedI) imagine reading an article (which on the iPhone is near impossible while walking) and deciding that in fact it's worthy enough to save. On the iPhone simply copy and paste on to notebook. On the note 3 nadda.UPDATE click the four square and then the page incon and then paste it any where.J) I also agree that the browsing can be glitchy unlike the iPhone where it happens on such a rare occasion I couldn't pin point an instance where I clicked on a link and went to a page I was browsing some time before.K) like the little wand that's included with the note 3. Without it I'd returned this phone due to the fact I need a jumbo phone for my big hairy hands and to read while walking.L) the note 3 also has a clean clear sounding speaker that I feel is better sounding than that of the iphone.M) the note 3 has, by far the worst and most resource hungry \"crapware\" I've ever seen.there are many but one stands out It's called Flipboard and I've tried and tried to rid my phone of it and it just keep re-appearing. If you are unfamiliar with this crapwear imagine your big brother telling you ,every time you look at him, the news that has paid him to shove down your throat.N) then to the music player. You may not be aware, note 3 has the weakest music player I've ever seen. It has next to zero navigation and seems to designed by a slacker.O) while iPhone is based on common sense navigation the note 3 is a genius type phone. People who have tried apps such as Adobe editor or Sony editor know exactly where I coming from. The user needs to literally take as collage course to use the editor only to find out more software needs to be purchased. One only needs to watch the help videos and then try the examples on their new phone to find that the phone must be in the correct mode for the example to be valid. Unlike the iPhone where all features work most anywhere on their iphone.P) ever click on a webpage phone number or a number that has ten digits? On iPhone the \"would you like to call?\" Prompt pops up. On note 3? It's dumb founded.UPDATE once one learns how to copy and paste this no longer an issueQ) IPhone abilities at Web browsing is near perfect. The note 3 has me jumping through hoops to trick it in to producing the requested page.R) when a message prompt appears at the top just click and redirect like on iphone? Nadda chance. The prompt reads \"15 messages\" then disappears leaving me to figure out where the messages are. Mms? Facebook? Email?UPDATE simply streak down and pick from the listS) technically it's not the phone as its Samsung complainantancy. Let me explain. When a an unfamiliar tune pops up I bring up the sound hound app. On iPhone I get the title of the tune and cover art, wiki link for the tune, just like on note 3. That is where the fun stops for note 3. Apple on the other hand has I tunes. I then get the opportunity to purchase the tune AND the music video. STILL trueT) let's move to the photo gallery. IPhone allows total access to your photos when posting on social sites such as FB. The note 3 on the other hand randomly sorts your photos and only allows a single category.U) a big plus for note 3 would be its acceptance of set standards. For example apple insists on owning everything associated with their products. The problem is when one wants to save a video from You Tube. The note 3 can with the right app since it likes to get along with just about anything. Apple products would rather fail than allow saving a clip to watch off line later.V) although we've touched on the music player the music store I use is Amazon. Unlike iTunes that downloads the music as I listen saving my bandwidth the note 3 only streams the music then forgets all about it forcing me to download every time I play the tune.UPDATE the cloud seems to have loaded the music onto my note 3W) again this is the service and not the phone BUT when I buy a song,video or snap a photo with an iPhone all devices automatically store the media via WiFi E.G. the ipads,apple TV apple phones and any computer associated with my account even if it's at my sisters house 2200 miles away STILL trueX) Imagine you have your note 3 hard wired to a laptop and want to transfer music nadda you must use the cloud if you have roomY) I know this comes with the territory When on a android OS but since jellybean can not run an ad blocker a large part of your monthly data plan will go to the endless ad banners, pop up and advertisers videos unlike apple where I found that the ads could be completely eliminated.Z) maybe the only other consideration other than the size of the note 3 would be the ability to finally run Flash player. Unfortunately jellybean does not support flash player so the ad banners pop up just about every where especially on the start up screen.ZZ) this last note isn't a plus or minus it's simply an observation that when the note 3 is fully charged the screen stays on. I've shut the phone off only to return and find its rebooted and the screen is on again. This phone still new but my guess is the power button wears out before the screen burns out....So there you have it. A very short list of \"short comming\" with this phone. Remember the comparison is between two Goliath Phones.
