{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HTC One Red is a Great Smartphone, However. it could be Better!", "Author": "Austin M.", "ReviewID": "R1RYW4782OZKUV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Dear Amazon Customers,I will make this as detailed and as Short as physically possible. at the end of the post I will also Answer some questions asked about this product.So, Let us start.Design/Body:This phone comes in a almost Coco-Cola Red Fully Aluminum body. it is all one piece so there are no cracks or seems in the phone at all. it is ice cold to the touch. The phone comes with fully rounded corners and Gorilla Glass 2 which stands up to scratchs and drops pretty nicely. However, on that subject. Let me be perfectly clear. This phone is Beautiful. You may feel the need not to put a Case on it. However, I STRONGLY suggest that you Buy a Case for it as this phone is so sleek. it will go from being a phone to a boomerang instantly. the First day I had this phone I dropped it around 8 times. The best way I think of describing this as it is like holding a wet bar of soap. So, Please I know you will LOVE the look of this phone so much you wouldn't want to put a case on it. But, either invest in a case or a Protection plan from both Sprint and Amazon. You will need it. This, also brings me to the next subject.Protection:The phone comes with Gorilla Glass 2 and a Fully Aluminum body. Since, Some people may be worried about how the phone will standup against you scratching it with your keys or throwing it across the room while failing to run from invisible Zombies (excising). Let me put your mind at rest. This phone and it's design can take a beating. I must of dropped,thrown,scratched this phone a good 30 - 50 times since buying it.. all from different feet. Sometimes on pure concrete, hard wood floors, corners of the side-walk. this phone has yet to have been scratched or damaged. (I Loved the look of the phone I did not get a case but a Protection plan from Sprint and Amazon.)Screen Size: it is a 4.7'inch screen. this is probably the perfect size. I have HUGE hands and it fits fine for me. I would not go larger as this already has trouble fitting into pockets. a 5 inch or bigger will not fit into pockets very well.Screen Clarity: The screen is a Beautiful! I had Samsung products all my Life and was jealous about the Clarity and True-to-Life colors of the IPhones. This phone Actually, Beats the IPhone 4S and Samsung Galaxy S4 Display and Clarity by Far. This phone has currently the highest DPI in any phone on the market.Camera: it comes with a Front and Back camera. This was my issue with this phone. Both cameras are \"Okay\" I am not looking to be a photographer with a smartphone. But, Honestly. the Ultrapixel marketing term is a joke. Yes. it has a Great Sensor built into the Camera. It takes \"Great\" looking Night shots. However, I believe they looked over a lot of things needed for the Camera to have made this a \"Great Camera Smartphone\"Software: Well, Besides Sprints \"bloatware\" there really wasn't much of a problem Software wise. Some people do not like Sense UI. I have never had it before and Honestly. I thought it was Fine. I quite enjoyed seeing a News feed constantly updated on the front page of my phone.Hardware: Great! it is running a tad-bit smaller processor then the Galaxy S4 However, the performance between the two will not be noticeable at all.Battery Life: Absolutely Horrible! Please HTC.. (and every other Smartphone maker) Please design better and bigger Battery's. I don't want to have to charge my phone every 2 hours. On a Good note: it last longer then my Galaxy S4. On a Bad note: Galaxy S4 has a Replaceable battery, This does not.Storage Space: it comes with 32GBs(depending on the model) I find this to be used up quickly(at least for me) since I store a lot of digital copies and music and photos on my phone.Questions and Answers:Does this phone come Unlocked:This phone does NOT come Unlocked. it is Locked to Sprints CDMA Network. The only Unlocked version of this phone comes in White: http://goo.gl/ihkA05Is this Phone Global Ready:No, this phone does not have a SIM Card Slot and is Not Global Ready.Does this phone have expanded storage(SD Card Slot):This phone does NOT have a SD Card Slot. (I wish it did)Does this phone have a extended or expanded battery:This phone has neither. You cannot open the battery compartment. So, you cannot remove the battery at all.Can this phone be rooted:Sprints version of this phone to be rooted is Extremely tedious. I would not say difficult. Just, time consuming.Can this be used on Other Networks:No. This phone is Locked to Sprints CDMA Network.If you have any questions. Feel free to reply to this review and I will Answer it as soon as possible.Take Care & God Bless-Austin M.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "The ONE To Rule Them All", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R3L8L2CO0RE1YY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What is there to say about this phone? If I just write about it, I'm just going to ramble on and on. So to save everyone some grief, here are bullet points (my direct comparisons are to the iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note 2, but mainly to the Galaxy S4):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5 is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the Droid DNA/HTC Butterfly's screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 4.7\" 1080p(468ppi) form. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Why do most reviewers laud the iPhone 5's aluminum construction so much, when it chips and nicks so easily?? If you want a true masterpiece in design and craftsmanship, look no further. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other case). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication(*cough*Samsung*ahem*).3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick!5) For a near 5-incher, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 2. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance.6) The UI and software design is now very minimal and simplistic. For better or for worse, if you are used to the old Sense UI's, you will need some readjusting. Personally, I like this new one better. If you're a casual news reader, then you'll like new default home screen which displays a gathering of news sources - some of its own partners, some for your Facebook and Twitter, etc. - to form a Flipboard style of news reader. Personally, I'm a huge Pulse news reader fan, so I only use that.The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2300mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. Another bad thing that I've noticed is it charges slower than most other phones.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4, the One is lacking. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4's fancy functions. The S4's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light. The S4 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and MUCH better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S4 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S4 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones right now.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "best smartphone ever", "Author": "J.J.

When I upgraded, I went with the HTC Evo 4G LTE. Now, I have added an HTC One to my account. All 3 phones have been great, but along with the hardware improvements, each generation came with some questionable design choices.So too with the HTC One. I was not a big fan of the non-removable battery on the Evo 4G LTE, and now the HTC One not only has a non-removable battery, but also no MicroSD slot. None of these things are really dealbreakers though. Thankfully HTC moved the micro USB port back to the bottom of the phone where it belongs, but why did they have to eliminate my beloved kickstand and camera shutter button? The overall performance of the HTC One is amazing, including the most gorgeous display I have ever seen on a smartphone. The whole phone is pretty much a work of art, with the awesome aluminum body (mine in red!). The audio really impresses me also. Now it's time to air my biggest gripe, and it was nearly a dealbreaker for me. I don't need or want access to social media at all times. I would much rather have quick access to my often used apps via the home screen, plus, after owning 2 previous HTC phones, I am totally addicted to the HTC Sense Animated Weather App. For these reasons, I dislike HTC Sense 5 with Blinkfeed! If HTC would provide a way to disable Blinkfeed and allow users to go back to the home screen from Sense 4, including the weather app, I would give this phone 5 stars. Oh, and one other thing HTC. How about providing a simple toggle in the camera app to disable the shutter sound? I was at a school play the other day, and I got many dirty looks from other parents because of the constant noisy shutter sound. I finally looked on the forums online and found the only way to disable the shutter sound is to turn the volume on the phone all the way down, but a toggle in the camera settings would be so much more convenient.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Balance, balance, balance", "Author": "Remy", "ReviewID": "R3UHFKSPSKBLZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Where to begin on the HTC One that hasn't been posted by countless consumer and professional reviewers??? Well, I'll basically reiterate what everyone has said.Let's start with the exterior: there is no better built phone on the market, period. No better feeling Windows phone, Blackberry, iPhone and ESPECIALLY Android phone. No matter what you pay for the phone, expect it to feel like a million bucks in the hand from the aluminum unibody construction. Every millimeter of the HTC One is crafted with care and precision manufactured with lasers, under the eye of elder metallurgists. Or at least I'd like to think that.Along the top edge of the phone is a 3.5mm combination headset/microphone jack towards the right and the power button/IR blaster on the left. Yes, you can program the phone to control your stereo, TV or any other infrared receivable item. Along the right edge is the volume rocker that has a really cool design on it that makes it easy to find when not looking at it. The bottom edge has your man microphone and micro USB 2.0 port. No micro HDMI. And along the left edge, you have the pin hole SIM ejector and the flush SIM card slot. The front of the phone has the display, 2 capacitive buttons (back and home), a front facing camera, light and proximity sensors along with your stereo Boomsound speakers. The back has your secondary, noise cancelling microphone and your main camera with flash. All specs to be explained below:- 4.7\" 1080p Super LCD3 display with 468 pixels per inch (ppi)- Snapdragon 600 Quad-core processor rated at 1.7 GHz, mated with the Adreno 320 GPU and 2GB of LPDDR2 RAM- 2MP front facing camera with a wide angled lens, capable of 1080p video recording and HDR photos- 4.1MP UltraPixel camera with optical image stabilization (OIS) and single LED flash- 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wifi- Bluetooth 4.0- NFC (Near-field Communication)- Capacitive touchscreen with up to 10 touch points- 2300 mAh Lithium-polymer battery- 2G/3G/4GLTE (Sprint only at 1900MHz frequency)- 32GB internal storage (26GB useable)If you're still undecided after seeing the specifications, I'll get into the cons:- Short battery life for ultra-heavy users w/o powersaver mode- Slow to charge from PC and 12V from car.- 4.1MP maximum resolution doesn't capture enough detail- Screen is too bright in a dark room with 0% brightness- Proximity sensor reads false positives often with skin oils left behind- Beats Audio limits maximum speakers' volume when engaged- No kickstand (coming from HTC EVO 4G LTE)Most these are nitpicking from a tech enthusiast like me and can easily be avoided or mitigated.Now, the pros:- Wonderful screen with excellent viewing angles- Quick speed from app to app with GREAT multitasking- Best Android overlay in the business. Clearly Android with many things to enhance your experience- BlinkFeed is by far the best software addition to Android any hardware manufacturer has added to it- Out of the box with Android 4.1 JellyBean with HTC Sense 5.0, Android 4.3 with HTC Sense 5.0 available with immediate update- UltraPixel camera captures better low light images than any other phone on the market- Boomsound is the best hardware addition to any phone, by anyone. Speakers are loud, clear and are placed perfectly- Build quality is unparalleled- Easily customizable with different custom ROMs, thanks to HTC's easy to unlock bootloader at htcdev.com- Zoe is cool and more functional than people give it credit for- No feature wasted that was packaged in HTC Sense, versus Samsung Galaxy S4- Sense keyboard is rather exceptional, as stock keyboards goI'd recommend this phone to anyone and I have. I've gotten 6 people to get some variant of the HTC One and each person loves it, as do I. And with prices at $50 or less for a 2-year contract (as of 1/4/2014), getting such a powerhouse is a no brainer!My own recommended list, without any order, are as such:- HTC One- HTC One Max- Samsung Galaxy Note 3- LG G2- Google/LG Nexus 5 (recommended to get 32GB version from Google Play)- Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition- Moto X", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "loving it.", "Author": "Reggie Hardamon", "ReviewID": "R2B3D7NFNQDATA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When i bought my HTC and didn't have a case i was so paranoid that i might drop it or crack it or something.

I'm a big HTC fan as is. Coming from having an HTC One X +, this phone is close in comparison, but doesn't match up. The 32Gb memory limits me from what I had gotten used to (64Gb). Having a faster processor that doesn't overheat, I expected to be able to use all the apps I had on my other phone as well, but that wasn't the case. Some of the apps I had grown to love had too much lag with this phone to be able to use. Some of the basic functions, mainly the alarm clock, disappeared with no known reason. In order to fix the glitches, I would have to factory reset the phone, which I am not willing to do at this point.  All in all it is a very good phone. And I may have been spoiled by my previous phone which I absolutely loved, but truth is I do have one to compare this to.

That S2 has without a doubt been the worst phone I have ever owned. None the less, the HTC ONE works and looks great! The ease of use is so intuitive everything just makes sense (no pun intended for the other HTC products). The software bundle that HTC provides just cannot be beat hands down. The beats package not only provides excellent audio, but can put together movie clips with your pictures with awesome effects and music. I actually use that feature all the time when getting ready to post something to e-bay, just to give the listing a little pizzazz. Aside from all the bells and whistles you could ask for, the basic's work too; I can make phone calls on it without the phone dropping the call every 30 seconds, I can get and send e-mails, I get my voice mails instantly, all the things you expect your phone to do it does and does well.The ONLY drawback to the phone, is that it does not have any kind of micro SD card, so no expansion. BUT, with that being said HTC has a deal with drop box where you get something like 20GB free space, just for using HTC. So it makes up for the lack of a micro SD card, you can have everything stored in drop box.So in summary, with this HTC you really can have your cake and eat it too.

If you NEED to have the latest news right away as well as utilize a Facebook and Twitter account you'd get more use out of it.  Both the front and rear cameras are pretty good, but I feel that the video is actually somewhat lacking.Then there's the Zoe feature.  Basically, it takes a video that's a couple seconds long and out of that short video you could utilize frames as if they were pictures.  Tested it indoors with standard lighting and it wasn't TOO bad.  I'm sure if you utilize it outside in good sunlight you'll get better use out of it.The phone comes preloaded with a decent selection of apps such as DropBox, Scout, PDF Viewer, KeyVPN as well as the standard Google fair (but now Google Drive oddly enough).Call Quality on both the headset and speakerphone comes out very clear and loud.  I was at my parent's place and when they had me call my aunt I would just put it on speakerphone so everyone can talk to her.  I typically don't do this but it worked very well with this phone.  Most of the times speakerphone is just a slightly louder version of the headset.Touchscreen works the way it's supposed to, but keep in mind that if you have the Otterbox Defender (the one with the build in screen protector) you may have to press a second time.  Not really the phone's fault, just a side effect of the screen protector.  Display itself is good.  My work phone is an iPhone 5 and I have to say that it pretty much matches that.All in All, a pretty good phone, and probably the best one I've used so far.  I like it better than my work phone (iPhone 5) in terms of size (it's bigger) and customization (a given with Androids).

Great, I thought! I have an HTC One, so does one of my kids and my wife is due for an upgrade. I placed the order. It was canceled with no explanation!I called Amazon support. At first glance they simply said it was rejected by Sprint due to a closed account. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?I called Sprint. After listening to their awful hold music for about 10 minutes I actually got a live person. They were clueless and blamed Amazon saying that phone number is available for upgrade.What the heck, I placed another order to see if it would go through. Same thing. I called Amazon again. The second person at Amazon was a bit more persistent. She called Sprint and found the problem.Now for some back story. A few years ago I had a business account for myself that was about ten or so years old at the time. For my wife I had one of the original SERO accounts (a real cool bargain!). I got an idiot at Sprint and was talked into combining my accounts when I wanted to get a 3rd phone for one of my kids. My business account was qualified for up to five phones. Of course the SERO account was for one phone. The SERO account was closed and my wife's phone was transferred to my account that was converted to a Family plan. Both previous accounts were in my name and my credentials (SSN) were on both.Fast forward to Black Friday and I got bit in the ass with the closed account. When Amazon's system poll's Sprint with that phone number, my name and last 4 digits of my SSN Amazon'z system sees the closed account and not the current one. The screwy part is that Amazon's system first checked by phone number only and that shows good.OK, it is a database issue, this should not be too hard to fix. I called Sprint. After the usual frustration of dealing with a level 1 clueless bot, I got transferred to someone who had more than 1 brain cell. She took one look and said \u201cI know how to fix this!\u201d. She then put me on hold. After a few minutes the line went dead. I got disconnected!I waited an hour to see if I would get a call from Sprint. No call. I placed order number 3 with Amazon to see if this actually got fixed. Order canceled again.I went for a walk before I broke my keyboard.When I got back I called Amazon again. This guy was not going to quit until we fixed this. He tried all kinds of things at his end, called Sprint National Sales Support. We almost made progress there, but this is where it gets screwy. Since Amazon records all of their calls, I am not allowed to say my full SSN over the phone. This is where things get even screwier, Sprint national Support can't do squat without my full SSN!At this point I want to hurt someone. Bad!I called Sprint again. This time I got no argument from level 1 to transfer me. This guy at Sprint, at my insistence, tried to delete my old account. No go. Change or delete my SSN? Nope, can't do it. He puts me on hold. After about 20 minutes, the line goes dead!The guy at Amazon called me back (really!). I told him what I had done with Sprint and he said there was nothing more he can do at his end. He said he flagged the account for a follow up.It really does not matter now, the sale is over. I got screwed and I am pissed at both Amazon and Sprint.Amazon is at fault for having stupid people code their software. They are also at fault for not having a way to do this manually with Sprint's National Sales Support!Sprint is at fault for still actually using a full SSN number! And for having such an outdated and defective database that they cannot even delete a simple field to allow the transaction to complete.At this point, I have 4 phones with Sprint. I informed my family we will not be upgrading our phones so I can let the contract expire. This experience on top of Sprint now having the slowest damn network in the nation, I am done with them. I just cannot afford the ETF fees for 3 phones.Amazon can bite me as well, as I will not be getting a cell phone from them ever again. Their system sucks! To their credit, they do have an awesome customer service crew, unlike Sprint.I spent almost 8 hours on the phone.

If you don't have a case on it, though, you probably will drop it a lot since the aluminum case is very slick. I'm not much into social media so the blink feed is a waste of a home page. Fortunately you can change the home screen if you do not like or use it.I have been a Sprint customer for over 10 years and this is the worst phone I have ever owned. I upgraded from an HTC 4G LTE which I liked more than any phone I can remember in quite some time. BUT, I was eligible for an upgrade and read all of the great reviews of the HTC One and really liked the red. I also had the opportunity to sell my 4G to a friend for $200 and purchased this HTC One from Amazon wireless for $120 so how could I go wrong?The phone will not stay connected to Sprint's network. I live literally 2 blocks from a Sprint 4G tower. I never had issues with my 4G LTE and my fiance never has issues with her Samsung S4. Her phone stays on 5 and 6 full bars on 4G while mine, right next to hers, will do from 5 bars of 4G to 1 bar then switch to 3G then drop my data connection altogether. I have taken it to 2 different repair centers, one of which was a corporate store, and they said nothing was wrong with it. One store told me it's Sprint's towers and that the tower by my house has had issues and had a ticket open on it. Hard to believe since the other Sprint phone in my house doesn't have issues. They also said since they turned off the Nextel towers they have had issues all over my area.I could go on but the point is that I have not had a good experience with this phone and if I hadn't sold my 4G LTE and traveled out of town for 2 weeks right after I got this phone, I would have returned it when I got back to town.
