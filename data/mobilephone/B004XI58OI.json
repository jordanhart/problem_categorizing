I combined this with a Telestial SIMple Calling Plus USA and Canada Dual-IMSI SIM with $10 Credit.  Phone was loud and clear everywhere I travelled in Canada and the US. You have to dial a 1 prefix for each number you call or you get a busy signal - not quite like a standard cell phone. I set my regular cell phone up to forward calls to this phone and as I travelled in Canada all my normal US calls were forwarded to this phone.  Text messages did not get forwarded!  Recharge minutes as you travel by using the phone and your credit card. Your minutes don't expire if you use the phone once every 9 months!NO LONGER WORKS IN CANADA.

In short, Telestial is a rip off company with an excellent store front and endorsements. I purchased from them due to the recommendation from Frommer's. That information needs to be updated. Two days before my trip, I discovered the phone was having problems. I called customer service and they issued a repair request that would take four days. I was already on travel within the United States to attend my graduation, so I didn't have time to get a new phone before heading overseas. For the next six weeks through five countries, I spoke with Telestial more than my family. Telestial NEVER corrected the phone problems, honored refunds or offered to replace anything. Their policy is that if you are able to make ANY calls on the phone then you received satisfactory service.If you are traveling on a budget and unable to buy a new phone while on travel. Don't buy from Telestial. If you are traveling alone and depending on the phone for all contact. Don't buy Telestial. If you are looking for a basic phone for emergencies and a few calls locally or overseas. Don't buy Telestial. You know what, just don't buy Telestial. If you do, be sure to buy a second phone.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "phone is a fire hazard", "Author": "ConnedSumer", "ReviewID": "R2ZCUWFXN2JX4O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't want a fancy smart phone stolen on trips; just wanted to be able to call for travel arrangements overseas.  Bought for use in France last year; coverage was spotty --had to aim the phone in a certain direction and get away from buildings.  Used a SIM card that came with the kit from Telestial.  Seemed like we were always refilling, paying $10 US after every call to local numbers in France so you are paying long distance rates, not the European rates you would get by purchasing a local SIM card.  But it seemed worth the hassle for a couple weeks out of the year.Was going to take it to Guadeloupe and Dominica for 3 weeks this year but the it was dead.  The battery was bloated out in the center and there was sticky plastic inside the battery case.  Ordered a new $10 battery plus something like $17 shipping from Telestial direct since they won't tell you the model of the battery in the instructions or on the battery; it just says  \"V4D Made in China.\"  The replacement battery (the white one) worked for a day but the next morning was dead after charging and could not be recharged.  Called their customer service and they sent 2 replacements (the original black ones).  Again worked when I inserted it and connected it to the charger, then blew out after charging.  After charging, the replacement was bloated in the center--the seams were stretched as if it was about to explode.  As always, I was using the charger provided in the kit with a surge protector, AC 110 with no power issues in my home.  Explained the situation to customer service and asked if I could send the batteries back because the phone, which was now out of warranty, seemed to be zapping them.  Telestial said they'd never heard of anything like this and would refer my case to their management.  Never heard back from them and don't have time to pursue it but I'm still out  at least $20 for a non-working battery, never mind all the $10 refills--no bargain for a bargain phone.Amazon sells a fine low priced quad band LG dual SIM you can use with overseas SIMs and your existing SIM card if you still use a feature phone.  Amazon also sells a more expensive shock and water resistant quad band Samsung single SIM perfect for adventuring.

I found myself going abroad on short notice.  I have a pay as you go phone that is not unlocked, so the SIM card was not an option.  I picked up this phone because you can make calls in the US and overseas.  It came in handy and worked in the US, Singapore, Hong Kong, Philippines, and Malaysia without fail.  It sucked up $$ in the Philippines, so I had to keep calls short.(skype is great from hotels.)Here are my comments.Negatives-1. This phone has less features than a 10 year old tracfone.2. Texts are a pain.3. Connection costs are high. I think about .79 per call? Check before buying.4. Some countries have high cost(see website to compare.5. Minutes and phone Numbers expire.Positives-1. Connected from every country I visited.2. Connection was decent and audible, and all texts went through.3. Phone arrived quickly, and was easy to set up.4. SIM can be used in any unlocked phone.5. No problems with battery life, or any other technical issue.6. Easy to reload timeRecommendation: Get a good unlocked GSM phone on ebay, and buy the SIM.

I'm not a typical phone user and with that I mean I use a phone to make/receive necessary calls and that's about it.  Any other cell phone/smart phone with all kinds of software and gadgets is wasted on me. Therefore I wanted very badly this phone to work. With dual sim cards I would have been able to use it overseas too.  Well, it was a complete disaster.Where I'm living, NC,  I was basically getting 2 networks, AT&T; and Vstream.  I found out rather quick that AT&T; did not work.  People were unable to reach me and if I attempted to make a call I got the message \"Your call can not be completed as dialed\". This happened dialing 1+areacode+ number or without dialing the 1. Vstream gave me better results, so I manualy selected the Vstream network. But even by selecting it manually, the phone unbeknownst to me switched randomly back to AT&T; and again nobody was able to reach me.  I made numerous calls to Ekit's CS. Remember, I wanted it to work. Unfortunately, no one came up with a solution. As a matter of fact, one technician made the suggestion that there was probably an interruption in service when using AT&T.; In my book an interruption is a temporary event. Not a constant. I finally wrote a letter to the power(s) to be in Boston. That was more than a month ago. Never heard anything back.  My v4d was probably tuned in to the AT&T; network!I give the whole experience one star, and that's for the alarm. It went exactly of at the time I had set it for. However, speaking of time, flying back from the west coast to the east coast the phone had not adjusted for the change of time. It had done so automatically when flying to the west coast. So keeping time was another issue I could not count on. So my one star is for the alarm only. That went off!If live has been good to you and you want to off-set it with some aggravation, buy this phone.Update 3/27/2013 regarding the comment left of the Ekit CSMy response to their comment was \"I did that review after calling/emailing you multiple times. What makes you think that it is the handset? It would be nice if that was the case but why would nobody had mentioned that before?Their response direct emailed to me: \"Thank you for contacting Customer Service.Unfortunately the handset is out of warranty and it appears as if your recent escalation / refund request was approved. You have been refunded your last transaction of $10.00.We apologize for any inconvenience caused, and if we can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact us.Kind regards,\"My response directly emailed to them was why bother to leave that comment. I mentioned in my original review that the phone was more than a year old.Btw, the $10 they are talking about is additional money I added to their sim card. So at my request they returned it.They were probably very happy to get rid of me.Meanwhile I did subscribe to Consumer Cellular, they mailed me a sim card and it works great in the v4d.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money", "Author": "Susan M Gordon", "ReviewID": "R1EI8T6Q2R2CGD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The product took much longer than indicated to arrive (this could have been the post office's fault) so I left on holiday before it arrived and by the time I returned it was too late to return it.  The product I received did not work and I had to pay to ship the product back to the USA three times while they tried to sort it out.  The last time I contacted them to find out when it was being shipped back to me and they seemed unaware that they had it.  They also sent spare batteries that did not fit in the phone.  By that time I gave up trying to deal with them.  Do not buy a phone from this company you will regret it.  I have continued to use the GOSIM I purchased with this phone on occasion in another phone, and it seems to work OK in some places (ie Southeast Asia) but in many North American cities it finds a network very sporadically, most of the time it is Emergency Call only.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lasted 3 months!!

Had no problems connecting to various Swiss telecom providers and coverage appeared to be good while traveling there.  Phone is pretty basic, but did receive and alert me to a handful of voice messages.  Didn't bother with trying to text so can't comment on that.  Phone went to 'standby' mode rather quickly, which occasionally was annoying and I could never figure out how to delay that, although on the other hand it helped limit placing the occasional 'butt' call and using up valuable minutes.  Overall, the phone did the basics that I needed and battery life was good.  My only issue was that I loaded the phone with minutes before I left the US and it seemed that the amount of time I had remaining varied from day to day; down one day and then back up the next.

We need to stay in touch, especially in case of emergencies with our clients. We thought Telestial's product would be the perfect solution. It would let us use one SIM card to talk to our local partners, and another SIM card to stay in touch with the office. Plus, the global SIM card would be easy to recharge. Well, we were wrong. We have tried several times to get it right, but every time Telestial has made it impossible for us to get the order straight. It is confusing to order the right SIM card. The customer service agents don't accurately track their calls, so when I called back to deal with a recurring issue, the person I talked to had no idea what the previous agent had told me would be done to fix my problem, and told me they wouldn't actually follow through. The instructions included with the phone in the original package are inconsistent, saying different things in different places. And, to top it off, the phone itself doesn't hold a charge well and the back battery cover doesn't stay on well. While it is possible to sort out how to deal with the company and their service packages by reading the fine print in every single document they send, it certainly doesn't make life easier, which is the goal of using the product. And the quality of the product is poor. I suggest buying an unlocked dual-sim quadband phone from a reputable manufacturer like nokia or LG, then MAYBE consider just the SIM card from Telestial.
