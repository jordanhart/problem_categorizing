{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice \"Upper-end\" budget phone ......", "Author": "Lionel B.", "ReviewID": "R2Q8GXYW95C9TQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a decent phone. I got the white one.Some high lights:Pros:- Screen size is 3.8\". It has multi-touch and screen detailing is crisp. Phone has a compact size.- Run smoothly on decent specs with dual core 800 MHz processor and 4 Gigs of internal memory. (a bit below the 1GHz on some high end phones with this same processor so this phone is probably underclocked for better battery life).- The phone has 768MB of RAM. (a bit below the 1GB on some high end phones).- Front-facing camera for video conferencing!! This gives the ability to skype or video-gtalk. Also gives the ability to add a face unlock app which is really nice.- Mobile Hotstop for tethering; WiFi Direct.- 1500 mAh battery with very good life. The phone will easily take you through the day with average use - I get 30 to 40 hours on a single charge.- microSDHC up to 32 GBCons:- Gingerbread 2.3.6 (Would have liked to see ICS 4.0x on the newer phones coming out this year, I have seen only one reference to possible Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0x upgrade)- Maybe the price is a tad high @ $290 and a lower price of $250 would be more competitive.- Camera could be snappier. Hopefully an update would take care of this.Network: Update 12/04/2012- 2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900- 3G Network:GT I8160 - 900/2100 MHz BandsGT I8160L - 850/1900 MHz BandsNote:Amazon list the phone as GT-I8160 but there are actually two models of this phone which have different 3g bands. I ordered the GT I8160 from Open Group Wireless. Check with the vendor for the model number before you order.Overall:This is a nice phone with internal specs just below some of the high end phones.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "I LOVE MY NEW PHONE!!!!", "Author": "ChAnPi", "ReviewID": "R1ESX1UPVMFVUY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent over an hour trying to decide on what kind of phone to get and it had to be at a good price. I wanted a phone with a flash and a foward facing camera. I came across a few but this one stuck out. I also needed a unlocked phone because I have pre-paid. I was very nervous because I've never owned a unlocked phone before and wasn't sure what to expect. I literally read every review for this phone *the English reviews because I speak only minor Spanish*. I weighed the negative to the postive and decided to order it. It came a day early and I tracked it so I would know when it was in my city. I waited 3 hours outside for the mail man, THAT is how much I wanted to go ahead and try this phone! I opened the box expecting something used or not right *the negative reviews scared me alittle lol*. But..everything was BRAND NEW!!!! It came with the phone *of course*, Charger, a European charger, and even earbuds for the phone. This phone is light but it runs VERY good! I did have to download a app to allow me to use MMS on my phone because it is a unlocked phone and I have AT&T.; It's a free app and now I can send pictures and receive them now. The camera on the phone is very vivid. The flash is BRIGHT lol but thats what I wanted! The foward facing camera words very good as well. Both camera's seem to take High Resolution pictures. The phone came and looked exactly like the picture. You do get to set the language if you need to \"it was on European English when it first turned on, English, United States is right under it\". I synced my Google Account to it and everything else was tooken care of. The call quality is great and so is the speaker quality. This phone is so amazing! My brother has a iPhone 4 and was impressed with this phone because it's a definite upgrade for me and it was only $206. I'm in love with this phone!!!!!", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Seller, not the phone, should be seriously investigated prior to buying!", "Author": "m9777", "ReviewID": "R2XA22QQAYF9XO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, the phone is an \"international version\"...Italian to be specific. Seller, Wireless Everything\" failed to disclose this \"little fact\" and Amazon still allowed them to sell it.  All...I repeat ALL...repairs and parts must be ordered out of New Zealand. (Samsung verified this fact as well.) That's going to be fun.  My first impression of the phone has not changed...it's a nice unit and my wife loves it.  It's the misrepresentation by this seller that has me so upset.  BEWARE of \"Wireless Everything\"!!  Amazon, you too should be ashamed of yourself for allowing this!!", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone, Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160", "Author": "Tony Collins", "ReviewID": "R2H0KQBVXFOECX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice phone. It is just as represented. I purchased it for my wife. It arrived in less than a week with standard shipping.  The phone was packaged in its original factory retail packaging (nice, elegant, white box), and sealed with all the usual original factory seals still intact with no evidence of ever being opened before.  This was evident when you opened the box an saw how nicely everything was packaged. This is why I like buying items that are fulfilled by Amazon.Performance:  The phone is very fast and the screen is extremely responsive, besides being very bright and sharp, with great colors.  Screen changes and menu navigation is very fast. You can really tell the difference with its dual core processor performance. The WiFi set up in my home was intuitive, it went quickly and very smoothly. It did the hand shake with my wireless modem/router right away and asked me for the key. The WiFi speed is much, much faster than the Galaxy GT-S5360 that I currently own for myself. It was also nice to have the Micro SD card slot accessible from the side of the phone instead of having to open the back cover.  The only reason you'll have to open the back cover is to insert the SIM card and/or to get to  the battery.  Also, this phone's performance in synchronizing with Samsung KIES is way faster than my GT-S5360.The camera photo quality is very satisfactory for a cell phone. Even interior pictures with natural light were good.  Just make sure you give a brief moment of time for the auto focus to do it's job. The front VGA video camera seemed to by fine also.Don't worry about some comments from people indicating that it came with a foreign language. It doesn't matter. The minute you start the phone, the very first screen that pops up contains the language selection box, with a drop-down menu.  It displays the current language.  To change it, simply click on it and scroll down the drop-down menu and select the language that you wish to use.  The language selections are written in their native spelling, so it's super easy to spot the desired language by anyone.  In my case, I scrolled down to \"English\" and that was it. Immediately thereafter all the set up screens popped up in English.  They also provided a small 2-prong US adapter for the European charger. It's handy to have the European charger if you ever travel to Europe, as we sometimes do. The charger itself is universal, so it will work worldwide with the right adapter.Don't forget to order your SD card and protective case cover at the same time so as to save on freight.  Also, you'll need the SD card to get started with syncing and other activities, so it's good to have it at the same time.Cons: So far we haven't experienced anything that we didn't like, but we'll update if we do.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its so fast", "Author": "Gab", "ReviewID": "RMFCDAQ39DI1F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works perfectly in Venezuela with Movilnet (2G/ 3G - 850/ 1900)It's light, HD, beautiful, and very fast.

Aguilar \"Phone junkie\"", "ReviewID": "RD43RJCZRYUX4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace an aging Blackberry Bold. I really liked the Blackberry but needed a new phone with a bigger screen. I compared the iPhone 4S, 5 and the Galaxy Ace 2, and Galaxy SII. The iPhones just didn't do it for me. After you weed through all the hype, its a smartphone that is more trendy than useful. At over $600 for 4S and $800 for the 32GB iPhone 5, it was too costly for the features included. The SII was too large to fit comfortably in my hand and felt like a small tablet. The Ace 2 had all the features I needed at a reasonable price. I've had the phone for 2 weeks and have no complaints. Would definitely recommend over iPhone.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "I started to have problems after one month/problemas despu\u00e9s de un mes", "Author": "Pats", "ReviewID": "R3V2C1FGONQUPG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about six weeks ago, the first 4 weeks it worked smoothly, I was very happy with my purchase and I thought I had found a great replacement for my old Iphone, but then, about two weeks ago, I felt asleep and I didn't charge my phone like I usually do. The next morning when I woke up the  battery was dead, it wouldn't charge anymore and Im sure it was the battery because I have a friend with the same phone and I tried her battery in my phone and the phone worked. I left it connected to the power for about eight hours straight and nothing. I had to put the battery in a plastic bag and in the freezer for 10 minutes (an old trick I learned from my dad) and it worked. I haven't had any problems with the battery in these two weeks, but I'm scared it might happen again, I have to be very careful not to let the phone run out of power and carry the charger with me at all times.Then, about a week ago I started to have problems with the camera too. It says it has some sort of error. I have to shut down the phone, take the battery off and  turn it on again in order for the camera to work (my friend, the one that has the same phone has the very same problem) This can happen once or twice a day and it gets REALLY ANNOYING!.I've read that the update to jellybean is coming soon. I really hope this is true and that these problems will be fixed with the new software. I live across seas and I can't afford to send it back or to exchange it.------------------------------------------------ESPA\u00d1OL----------------------------------------------------------------------Compr\u00e9 este tel\u00e9fono hace 6 semanas aproximadamente, las primeras 4 semanas funcion\u00f3 de maravilla, pero hace como 2 semanas me qued\u00e9 dormida y no lo puse a cargar como normalmente hago. En la ma\u00f1ana cuando me despert\u00e9 la pila estaba muerta, no cargaba y el tel\u00e9fono no prend\u00eda. Estoy segura que era un problema con la pila porque tengo una amiga que tiene el mismo tel\u00e9fono y prob\u00e9 poner su pila en mi tel\u00e9fono y funcion\u00f3. Lo dej\u00e9 cargando como por 8 horas y nada. Al final, tuve que poner la bater\u00eda en una bolsa pl\u00e1stica en el freezer y funcion\u00f3 (un viejo truco que aprend\u00ed de mi papa). No he vuelto a tener problemas desde ese d\u00eda,  pero  tengo que estar pendiente de que el celular no se descargue completamente de nuevo y llevar el cargador conmigo a donde quiera que vaya.Despu\u00e9s de eso, hace como una semana, empec\u00e9 a tener problemas con la c\u00e1mara. Me sale un mensaje diciendo que hay un error. Tengo que apagar el celular, quitarle la bater\u00eda y volverlo a prender  para que funcione la c\u00e1mara. A mi amiga, la que tiene el mismo tel\u00e9fono, le pasa exactamente lo mismo. A veces esto puede pasar una o dos veces al d\u00eda, y es un verdadero FASTIDIO.Le\u00ed por ah\u00ed que la actualizaci\u00f3n a jellybean viene pronto, de verdad espero que esto sea cierto y que con la actualizaci\u00f3n se corrijan estos errores. No vivo en Estados Unidos y no puedo pagar para devolverlo y no puedo cambiarlo en mi pa\u00eds porque la garant\u00eda no lo cubre.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "had to spend over 100$ getting a virus off of the phone when i received it", "Author": "amanda", "ReviewID": "R2DCEKM5YW4CA8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i had multiple problems with the phone when i received it.

Thorp", "ReviewID": "R349SUKQ42Y46V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "To begin with, this is a very sleek phone with an easy to grasp operating system. The phone itself is light but seems sturdy and well-built.  Button placement is logical with crisp actions.  However, performing operations beyond dialing on this phone is tedious.  If you have ever owned an old computer on which you installed the latest operating system, you know what I mean.  Having more than one user application open at any given time noticeably slows the entire system.  Make the mistake of using two or more relatively tame applications at the same time and you are likely to freeze the entire system.  I put most of the blame on how Android treats background operations, but the phone hardware is equally liable.Skip this phone and get an older iPhone or perhaps the Galaxy S2.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "excelent", "Author": "alejandro2705", "ReviewID": "R200XKJZEJWT8K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the model tha i recibe was I8160L (3G at 850/1900 MHz movistar and movilnet venezuela), the shipment was excelente before the timeel modelo que recib\u00ed fue I8160L (3G para 850/1900 MHz movistar y movilnet venezuela), el env\u00edo fue excelente llego antes de lo indicado", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Evolution From #1 to #2 ACE", "Author": "alesc04", "ReviewID": "R2C81HS8ERMOGY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "is Fast, Friendly, very well shaped and design, 5 thumps up for this phone. and from this seller as soon as i put the sim card inmediatly reconigze the net and starter to download all what it need to update it.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "gift", "Author": "auyanetjl", "ReviewID": "RCSI4C5AZXOYL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the phone was for a gift but turned out ok, the person loves it.
