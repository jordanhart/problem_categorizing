The phone was crystal clear in its operation when I called the USA from Europe.  But to function as a camera - it's not the best.  Also, I was unable to find a good user's manual which detailed how the phone's menu worked.  I went to the manufacturers website and found nothing about the menuing system - that was frustrating.  So, I had to just sit down by trial and error learning what the menu did.  That was very frustrating, too.  So, after I learned how the unit worked by trial and error, I found the phone to have lots of capability for the price I paid for it.  I now like the phone but I did not like the process by which I learned to use it.  One final thing - use the ROAM SIMPLE service for low cost international telephoning - they are great!", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works well", "Author": "Raj", "ReviewID": "R2ZWWE9Q9M0ERD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works well in India.

It really is cheap.  So far he loves it.  Issues so far, listening to FM radio with headphones, volume is way too loud, even at the bottom setting before no sound at all, it's too loud, have to use a headphone with separate volume controls.  The music player will not add the music on the Micro sd card.  He can only listen to the songs one at a time.  The user manual is garbage.  I will spend a little more for a better phone if he breaks this one or loses it.  For his first phone it is fine though.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Might be for you, might not be.", "Author": "Nuwanee", "ReviewID": "RKE0XIWSPMB3R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For those who need two cell numbers for one reason or another (and therefore two SIM cards), I'm sure this is an excellent phone. Especially if you speak Spanish, since the default settings are apparently Spanish. I did not expect that. It might be a nice thing to add to the description. I'm glad I know enough Spanish to have changed the settings.In my opinion, there's no point in it even having a QWERTY keypad, since the messaging system is unnecessarily complex and hard to use.I actually got it because I needed a cheap replacement for my phone with a QWERTY keypad, because mine was ignoring calls without alerting me to the missed call. At least I could check my voice-mail with the old one, though. The only way I have found to even GET to my voice-mail (and I am reasonably tech-savvy) is by having someone leave a message, after which it will prompt me...which would be...workable...if it weren't for the fact that I'm apparently supposed to know and input the number for my voice-mail myself. Every other phone I've ever had automatically had that number, presumably based on my service connection for my specific phone number.However it works, it has always just worked, and I have no clue how to access my voice-mail now.I am very seriously considering reverting back to my old phone, despite unwittingly missing calls frequently.Of course, being a small phone, if you have large fingers, you will find yourself unable to use the QWERTY keypad whenever you do actually need to. This is no issue to me, as I have small hands, but it's just fair warning.I'm glad to be able to comfortably talk on the phone again, since my old phone always had mediocre call quality, but I'm not sure it's worth the trade, since I text more than I talk. I have found texting to be a quick, easy, and efficient way to relay information throughout the day without actually disturbing my or any else's day with a full phone conversation (or multiple!)- and this puts a bit of a damper on my usual mode of conversation.I also have yet to convince it to be on simple \"vibrate only\" mode. I don't like it making noise while I am at work, but I DO like to know if I have a call or get a message I need to check later. Silent mode doesn't allow me to know when someone IS trying to contact me.Honestly, my experience with this phone has been trying.There are a variety of features it has that I don't need and couldn't care less for, such as access to FaceBook and such. I have come to expect this out of any phone with a QWERTY keypad, though. Apparently, comfortable texting also equals 500 functions for keeping \"connected\" via every possible avenue with everyone you know, and all the ones you don't actually know, too. I wish I could just find a phone with easy, comprehensive texting; easy, clear phone calls; perhaps an easy-to-use calendar planner system; and maybe a few games and a decent camera.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "\"LOL\" as some might put it.", "Author": "L. kokoszka \"kombat pikachu\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZG6TLBQ8TQZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a 35 dollar phone.  Five stars!  Now here are the things I have been curious about.App break down.There is a facebook icon on the main screen.  The graphic is misleading.  It just takes to to the blu club screen.Blu club-seems to be the main apps offered for the phone for social purposes.  It has twitter (this one displays parts of tweets. You have to expand each one to find out what people tweeted in 140 chars or whatever it is that the limit is. Facebook- seems to be just facebook messenger and mail.  No actual wall posts, which is good since you won't be frustrated with 2g downloads of memes.  Gmaes-seems to just hold facebook, twitter and yahoo messenger shortcuts.  Perhaps the games go there? Yahoo Messenger- I guess just im service.  I do not have an account, so I won't bother checking.In order to use any of the apps you must have an sd card installed.There is a  blu store that has an handful of little apps you can download.  Nothing i would care about.I have put an 8gig card in my phone, and filled it half way with music.  I was worried that the phone would take too long to navigate such a massive amount of storage, but it handles it very well.  The music is organized by artist, and track number.  Only it is a single list, so if you have a lot of songs on there, get ready to scroll. Once it is playing, it is playing.Videos seem to be in avi format.  You have to change the settings to store to sd card.  I do not know why the default is internal memory, since that is non existent as stated in another review. Tried putting some avi movies on it, but that failed.I thought it would have email, but all that is on the phone is a push messenger, which I suppose is for the use with twitter, facebook and yahoo chat.  I guess one less app to worry aboutPhysical.The phone is small.  I like it like that. Fits in all my pockets.  it is very lightweight. plastic lightweight, but at the same time feels like an etch a sketch, so I do not think it will break anytime.  The keys sound like bubble wrap. Maybe not as loud, but nothing I would use when people are meditating near by.  The wheel in the center did give me trouble sometimes by going diagonally sometimes when in the menu.There is no volume button.  There are sound profiles that are accessed in the main screen, by going up above the bottom row of tiles.  It is very easy to miss if you do not know what you are looking for. There is very few audio tones built in, but you can set your own from file when you customize the profile.Instruction manual sucks.  This phone was not made for america.  There is an adapter for us socket, that you plug the european socket into, that has a usb port.  You have to use all three, unless you are not in America.  It uses a standardized micro usb i think they call them.  Same plug that is used in android devices.", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone..

The problem is that it cuts off phone calls abruptly and without any reason. And when you make calls it takes a long time to process the call and at times simply will not do so. It could happen while you are walking, it could happen while you are sitting at home. So you have a phone that does not call reliably and a phone that does not pick up calls reliably.  May I also add that it also does not at times ring when people call? It is a shame since it is a cute phone and rather inexpensive. But I am now convinced the phone is cheap because it is badly made, and it is better to spend good money and get a proper phone. This is the second Blu phone I have purchased and both of them had similar problems and were not reliable.
