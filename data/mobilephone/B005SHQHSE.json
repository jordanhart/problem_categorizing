{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Rugged and Simple Phone", "Author": "Neel", "ReviewID": "R33LVYFMVKI2RM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Rugby 2 is one of the most durable phones available on the market. My last phone was a Nokia N80. While that phone was durable, nothing comes close to this one. Not only is it waterproof but also dirt-proof and shockproof. I found that although it is a bit clunky at  more than 1/2 inch, it is still mildly stylish. The phone has a flat appearance from above. Also the inner keyboard makes it look very simple yet very well made. I found the keyboard to be larger than most phones. It is thus perfect for anyone who has trouble viewing or pressing small numbers. Similarly, the screen is very large and easy to navigate around. The battery life is exceptionally long. It can \"standby\" for about 3 weeks--this is unheard of from flip phones. Nevertheless, I can see how the price might be a bit high to pay for a \"rugged flip phone\". I believe that the AT&T; website offers it with a contract but for less money. If you'd like to search for more discounts, I would recommend starting a family plan or checking if your work place offers any exclusive discounts.I would definitely suggest buying this phone; I don't think it will break very easily.", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Rugby 2", "Author": "Steven Seymour", "ReviewID": "R1GLGE2JZ3ZMLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has better reception than any cell phone I've had.

I bought it after researching the phone online. I found that it is very durable, complies to military standards, is shock resistant, rain resistant, etc. I only use the phone for phone calls and texting. I did not need the features of a smart phone, nor do I like paying $75. or $100. a month for a cell phone. I have AT&T; \"Pay As You Go\" plan which I have had for the last 5 years. I pay $25. every 3 months and have never run out of minutes, its basically 10 cents a minute. Think about it, $8.33 a month! If my minutes do run low, I can always add more minutes if I need in any increment I want, $10. $15. etc. and they do rollover.The best feature of the Samsung Rugby 2 phone is the call quality. Every review I read mentioned this and it is true, it never drops a call and the call quality is remarkable. Samsung has done a great job building a rugged phone. The phone costs $265.00 retail from AT&T; without a contract. I was able to find it on Amazon, brand new, unlocked, for $125.00. A great deal! The only way to get it cheaper is buy it through AT&T; with a 2 year contract for $99.00.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone for price", "Author": "TKV", "ReviewID": "R3KCBWMEUW30VX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Rock solid and meet all the expectations.

I know it was brand new because it still had all the plastic peel offs and everything that comes with the phone was factory sealed. This phone would not hold a charge for more than one day so I sent it in for warranty repair. I got it back as unrepairable because of water damage. I know without a doubt that this phone has never been even slightly wet since I only had it for a couple of weeks. So, they sent the phone back and when I got it the charge is holding fine but they broke the green \"send\" button. They now refuse to fix the button they broke since they have labeled the phone as unrepairable. So to sum up, I am stuck with a phone that I paid a lot for, that doesn't work because Samsung warranty department broke it.

There is a dedicated button on the top left side for \"PTT\" a built in feature \"Push To Talk\". It is a subscription based walkie-talkie like option.

I have a Company smart-phone, but I needed something a lot simpler to use as my personal phone.  I do not text on it, nor do I have a data plan.  I only use it as a phone - pure and simple.  I'm a senior citizen and like the large keys and the large screen fonts it uses when phone numbers are being typed in.  I've also managed to drop it onto a concrete sidewalk several times, and like the old Timex watches, it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.  It's one tough little phone.  I keep it in my back pocket or front shirt pocket, and it stays put without slipping out (its case seems to grip the fabric a lot better than my old hard-plastic Nokia phone).  I chose the Rugby 2 over the Rugby 3, because the Rugby 2 is a lot smaller and lighter.  The Rugby 3 is large and heavy, because it has a bigger battery in it.  I'm not a teenage girl, so I don't need the extra hours worth of talk time that the Rugby 3 will give you.  Since this phone is \"unlocked\", I simply removed my old SIM card from my broken AT&T; Nokia phone and inserted it into my Rugby 2.  Worked like a champ with no re-connection problems.  One note before going:  the User's Guide that comes in the box is the \"condensed\" version' be sure to download the full User's Guide from Samsung, or you will go crazy trying to figure our some of the phone's features.

The ptt button is also an accidental button to be pushed almost everytime you use the phone so be ready to play the hey we are stupid and never tested this phone in real life game, only comes with like five ring tones lame, and to get more will cost some bucks, and no you can't cut down the songs to fit the requirements, the only option I've found is to record your own then it's all staticky and distorted when it rings, so live with five unless you want to spend ten for a month of internet and two dollars for each ring tone in which case you order ten just say that's thirty bucks to get just ten ring tones, I don't have internet but it doe's accidently get pushed and I could see how this could really tick some people off as well, well the good stuff I DONT CARE part, it's a loud ringer, the volume is good (Usually) it's durable, water wind rain dust shock, etc, military grade claimed.  The buttons are big I like.  oh remember just because you close the case doe's not always mean you ended your call so beware that gimmick as well, check to see if the little picture on front hangs up the phone or not, I've had many a call that never ended and that's uncool, big time.  Other than all it's bad when you are in damp light rain situations it's nice to know you are not killing your phone, when you drop it on concrete it's nice to know you will still have a phone after, one last thing you can play music I've got seven hundred songs on it and the speaker sounds mint with them, sometimes it works with the phone closed and sometimes it will only work with the phone open like now when I'm actually using it, so if you don't mind a phone that is possesed by a mean demon then buy it, it hasn't let me down yet for it's main purpose, if battery dies shut it down for ten minutes then make that emergency call quick it will gain enough strength, oh and pics are good and ez to get to with shortcuts, forget voice commands my free verizon phone worth about three dollars has better voice recognition than this one, even when spoken slow and clear it still pulls up everything but what you said, maybe it's my speech but I really really doubt it, I speak pretty well, one of the few things I've actually got on my side not just braggin.  So charge her every day after a year she's only good for about three twenty minute calls before she get's to one bar or two and if you play music with the speaker like I do now (no mp3 player now) it will die after about an hour of play, but battery with no use and being shut off will last without losing a bar for over a week it's been tested.  So shut her down for three to seven days and expect a full fresh charge.
