{"Reviews": [{"Title": "*Sadly a dying breed...", "Author": "*Elephant* \"ki\"", "ReviewID": "R3FYWL018DZYZ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*I really love this phone. I have not had any problems with it in a year of using it; great call quality, talktime, hearing volume, can perform multiple functions at once, loud mp3, and ringing, never dropped a call, and the alarm even works when you turn off your phone. Other than certain chargers actually draining the battery, I couldn't ask for anything better. I'm not a fan of the \"smartphone\", or sliding phones. Unfortunately there are no new versions of this, or any like it. Less often can you find a cell phone with TWO SCREENS, let alone standard keypad, AND keyboard. Which are far better features than touch screen ANY day. I enjoy not having to pay extra data usage for a phone I actually like. I guess I'll use this phone until it's as outdated as the first cellphone ever, and they force me to \"upgrade\" (To what? More money to essentially do the same junk, but with freezing, and easier to break as a bonus?) because seemingly there won't be anymore like it. Maybe texting phones will make a COMEBACK, lol. One can dream... sighs.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's a pretty good phone", "Author": "Vince", "ReviewID": "R3IE6M71JZQFVA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about a year and a half ago at a local retailer and have since had it replaced once for multiple problems. The main one being every time a call or text message came in, the phone would shut off. It wasn't externally, or internally damaged in anyway. It was a software problem and a fried wire. T-Mobile replaced it for free. Although I got it replaced, the new one has its moments. Occasionally it won't send text messages, or make calls. It gets annoying sometimes. All over, the phone is very easy to use. The menu couldn't be easier to use, and the layout is great. I love the keyboard even though the keys are a tad small, and the camera isn't too bad. I use about 2,500-3,500 text messages a month and about 3.5 hours of calling. 9.5/10 times the phone is there for me.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great phone for my texting daughter", "Author": "MomInNY", "ReviewID": "RJ3V5F9DRRSCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my daughter's second Comeback. The first one lasted about a year and a half, and would have lasted longer if she didn't go swimming in the gulf with it!  It seems to be pretty durable. My daughter is 12, and texts constantly. We don't have web service for our phones, and there are only a few phones that don't require it, and this one has served us well. Make sure you are getting the phone from a good company though.  The first one I ordered was definitely used, but sold as new, and had to be sent back. I spent just a few dollars more with a different company, and it was worth it.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "comeback", "Author": "rissa", "ReviewID": "R2OM27LBPXD2ID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had this phone for over a month now, it works great and was sent unlocked.

The other thing that started happening a couple months after was that it would randomly shut off. I would just go to check my phone and it would be off. Also very annoying. The last thing that happened just last night is it wont send text messages. It will recieve them, and I can make calls, but I can't send them. I hope I can call T-mobile and have em fix it.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!!", "Author": "D.

I'm irritated constantly by the clock, which is terrible.  Small readout (can't change it), doesn't show during sleep mode, can't read the date on the front screen, when you unlock the phone the time \"updates\" a second later, creating the possibility you might read the time wrong.  During some screens, the clock is blocked.  You can't read the time during a call.  The clock is a basic function I use my cellphone for, because I don't carry a watch.  If you are the same, skip this phone!Other irritations: buttons light up pink.  A white phone with pink keys.  Too girly for me.Takes three keystrokes to unlock  the phone.  That's at least one too many.Otherwise, sound quality is good, and I actually like the keys.  Battery life seems good.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE this phone!!!", "Author": "IK", "ReviewID": "RRNRLN1Z63B5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone, it's sturdy (I've dropped waaaay too many times to count) little one dropped it in water (submerged it) dried out pretty quick now it's functioning just fine :)", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "My favorite phone", "Author": "Artemist", "ReviewID": "RD3OMYO6Q6UMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As someone who has been stuck with hand-me-downs forever this was the first hand-me-down I actually enjoyed. It flips open to reveal a larger screen and a qwerty keypad but also allows for quick texting using T9 capabilities. The camera is decent.  I love that I can add a micro SD card for more storage so that I don't have to worry about being charged for e-mailing photos to myself. The micro SD card can also be used to store MP3s.What is also nice about this phone is that you don't have to stick with the stupid default ringtones that come with the phones or spend $5 just on downloading a song segment for a ringer, you can use your MP3s as your ringtones. A nice bonus.This phone has instant messaging, a camera, E-mail of your choice, and even an mp3 player. This is perfect for someone who wants a nice phone without having to go the smart-phone route. Simple, but reliable with good features. It's also a plus if you like Star Wars because the white one looks like a Storm Trooper phone :PMy phone got stolen a few months ago and I immediately ordered the exact same one. I'm almost never satisfied enough with a phone to get the same one twice.

My first lasted about two years but I have dropped it A LOT. Eventually the outer screen stopped working. I bought a new one and have no complaints.

Takes great photos, even has photo editing in the phone (so you can capture and edit the perfect wall paper for your comeback!) This phone is great, absolutely no complaints!
