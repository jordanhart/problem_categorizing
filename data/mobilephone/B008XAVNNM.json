No way to select vibrator vs sound for alerts or calls.  It appears to have a vibrator because with some menu selections it will acknowledge with a slight shake.2. You can turn the volume down from maximum of 7 to 0 and you will not get a ring when a call is received; however you will still get an alert sound every time there is a text message and I have not found anyway to turn that off.UPDATE: I just learned how to set the device to vibrate and not ring.  There is a pull down menu accessed by a tiny series of bars, that brings up some options for profile etc. In one of these the alerts can be changed.  I found this out from a UTube video on the EX223, not from any manual or forum.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "My my, very nice", "Author": "DrSparx \"The Master of Sparx\"", "ReviewID": "R33N7QW47T87ID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an unlocked dual SIM GSM phone.

The instructions are NOT in English but for anyone with a basic knowledge of how a phone works it is very easy to learn. Camera is OK, nothing special but it is a cheap phone.
