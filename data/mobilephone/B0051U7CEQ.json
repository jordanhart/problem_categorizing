Its not bulky. I dont feel like im holding a book up to my head when im talking. The speakerphone works great. Text messaging is alot easier if you download Thick Buttons app from the market for free.Over all for toughness its survived some pretty hard falls and still has not broken.The battery life with just wifi on and a few programs running is good. It will last all day and part way into the next.Only thing i wish it had was a fold out or pull out QWERTY keyboard. But with the mentioned App it is so much easier for me to type.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for the money", "Author": "Michael D. Macdonald", "ReviewID": "R3UQDDB79AQADO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE: Most of my complaints about the phone have been solved with some research and I am changing my rating from 3 stars to 4. Biggest issue for me is that the flash isn't supported on the phone. A few hints if you buy the phone to save you some time:-When you move the sim from your old phone to this one and access your contacts, they appear to be un-editable. Instead of tapping or double-tapping the contact, press on it instead. In a second or so, a menu will appear with options to edit, delete, etc. Also there is the option to export to PC-sync which I recommend. After you do that, the contact will be in there twice. After syncing your contacts, I'd get rid of the old.-The default language on this is German. That's easy enough to fix in most places but the keyboard app was more obstinate. I took a second tour through the settings and finally found the option for the default language for the keyboard.-Downloaded apps can quickly fill the phones memory. Go to App Manager > All Apps and pick each one individually. About 1/3 can be moved to your SD card.This is definitely an entry-level phone and as I wrote in my original review (below), I think I should have spent another $80 for a little more functionality or at least a little more screen area. Aside from the lack of support for flash, there are no huge deficiencies.My original review:I bought this phone to replace my current AT&T; cell phone. I didn't want to get into contract extensions and I didn't want to get into one of their higher priced data plans. My prior phone was considered to be a non-smartphone (I think semi-literate would be more appropriate) and so I had a pretty decent deal of $15/mo unlimited data. I hadn't dealt with unlocked phones before and so went into it with some trepidation.This is definitely entry-level in the smart-phone arena...one review I read after it arrived called it a phone aimed at the teenage market. Also, this phone was clearly intended for a European audience...the default language is German and the phone arrived with a European-to-US adapter for the recharging cord. The one that was in the box didn't work actually...the vendor did send a replacement but I was lucky enough that the recharger for my old Motorola fit and worked just fine.Connecting my phone to AT&T; really was as simple as removing the SIM from my old phone and slipping it into the new one. The phone comes with a 2 gb micro SD card. I removed it and popped in the 4 gb one from my old phone.The LG P350 comes with Android 2.2 installed...there are oodles of downloadable apps. I quickly found an app to stream HBO and Epix over my cable company's wifi connection. The phone is up-gradable to Android 2.3.x though I haven't been brave enough to do so as yet.The LG App Adviser built-in is supposed to suggest apps to download but in getting to know you it wants to know whether I was from Europe or Africa. Happily -- I guess -- a third option was to declare that I was a citizen of the world. The phone recommended I download a fitness app...I do need to lose a few pounds but I'm a little puzzled how the phone knew that lol.The touch screen works but isn't super-responsive. With most apps, you can turn the phone on its side and the screen re-orients. In some apps, \"Enter\" is in German or Spanish...there is no English option. Other than that little quirk, it's easy enough to find English for everything else.The phone doesn't seem to support any sort of flash player which is a disappointment.The phone connected easily to my wi-fi and was fairly speedy. When travelling, the phone connects automatically to wi-fi hot-spots though you can turn that off.The phone is supposed to be 3G compatible. I haven't seen how to do that and suspect it is only 3G compatible with T-Mobile. I can access data over AT&T;'s 2G network but it is slow and it seems to be the default. When I am home, I make sure that I turn off that feature to force it to use the wi-fi. (By the way, to connect to the AT&T; mobile data network, select settings, network and APN. Enter an APN of \"wap.cingular\" (no quotes of course). Give it whatever name you want.)The GPS function seems to work but I haven't really tried it on the road because of concerns about pulling that much data over the 2G network and a fear that the AT&T; Police will catch up to me. I have the phone set up to warn me if I pull large amounts of data over the mobile network.The phone is fairly good looking and feels solid. The display is bright enough but the quality of the text is sub-par...the screen resolution is 320 x 240.I'm sure the user manual is clear enough to someone who is smarter than me but I found it a tad obtuse.The phone ships with an LG Import app on the SD card which you can copy to your PC (or can be downloaded from LG). It is an exercise in frustration. I'm sure it serves a purpose but I've as yet to figure out how. Quick example:-To import the contacts from your old phone, the book suggests you use your old phone's export to CSV utility. My Motorola has no utility to export addresses.-I did copy the addresses to the SIM and the LG recognized them okay but the PC utility program didn't see them. In fact, the contacts on your SIM can't be edited and can't be exported. Your only option is to re-enter them and store them in your phone's memory.The phone's internal memory is quite chintzy (170 mb I think?) and most apps want to be installed there. Some apps give you the option of being moved to your SD card but most don't.Battery life on the phone is at best so-so. Be sure to use the App Manager to kill applications running in the background as many of them tend to burn up the battery. If you use power-hungry applications such as GPS, the battery will last 2.5 to 3 hours. If you have nothing running in the background, you can get 4 to 5 hours of talk time and 3 or 4 days of standby. If you aren't careful of what is running in the background, you might only get a day of standby.The phone does charge from your computer's USB port when connected.I haven't tried the camera or video recorder built-in.The phone has a pretty decent voice navigation system. I can pull up Google, for instance, and speak my search term instead of typing it in. Considering the limited space for the keyboard on the screen, this is very nice.If I had it to do over again, I think I'd spend another $70 or $80 and get something with a somewhat larger and perhaps more responsive screen. At $130, the phone is a decent buy and is kind of fun.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value for the $$", "Author": "Vikram Krishnamurthy", "ReviewID": "ROG3BUCMHZ9U2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The first thing I checked was if the device was unlocked as claimed.

No major problems, freezing or software issues. battery life isn't bad if you turn off the GPS and location stuff if you're not using them and lower the brightness of your display (I finish the day with ~60% left).You have to keep in mind that it's not a very powerful device. I've read reviews where people got disappointed with the phone because they didn't have a clue of what they were buying. Yes it's an android phone but this's not galaxy S II or one of those fancy HTC devices. It has a limited chip and internal storage so you can't just download tons of applications and expect the device to run smoothly.you will still be able to enjoy all the basic applications and your favorite ones.

Williams \"FrequentFlierGuy\"", "ReviewID": "R2BSWIZQYTPWEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Going from the US to France, this was a great choice to use with pre-paid service from Orange. Also, my phone was sold by Breed and arrived new in the box with all accessories and in good working order (not a refurb or knockoff).All the basic features that I care about as a tourist worked well- voice, internet, email, and maps.  Also the 3G cellular internet has worked well so far in Paris.  Plenty fast enough for maps, email, basic web searches, google translator.The form factor of the phone is smaller than most current smart phones.  I am mid 40's in age and did not have any problems reading the screen, though.  Also no problems typing on the screen (can download the thick buttons app as an earlier reviewer suggested).I haven't tried playing games, etc as this is a \"cheap\" smartphone and I don't want to bog it down and compromise the basic features.Also, the camera app is OK.  I have a 16gb micro sd card that I purchased separately that I won't come close to filling.  It is a 3 mp camera as the phone description states- so it is what it is. Fine for snapshots, not much more.On a side note- I found the best way to get a sim card was just to go to an Orange store in Paris and let them install it and make sure all is working well.  My plan was 20 euro for unlimited domestic voice for a month, which included 250 mb of cellular data.  Got another 500mb of data for an additional 10 euro.  Unlimited Orange wi-fi was 20 euro for the month, but they don't allow telephony (internet calls like skype). Rates for using the phone to call back to the US are 9 eurocents per minute (and you can still skype on hotel wi-fi, just not the Orange service).At 1/6 the price of a current unsubsidized smartphone, the phone is a winner.  Compared to the choice of just buying a feature phone, this one makes so much more sense for traveling to me.  I would really be sorry to miss out on email, maps, and web for the small dollar difference (even though wi-fi would enable those on my US phone to some extent, so much easier having one phone working for everything).", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Purchase to Amazon and I received right a way", "Author": "DANILO JOSE O.

I bought a alacatel 806a from ebay for $30 and that 2megapixl camera is great indoors  and out! I love to take pics and upload them to facebook so that was my main reason to upgrade my alcatel and it was disapointing but i can live with itUPDATE******* Nov 6 2012I still love this phone unfortunately if fell in water twice!!!!the first time for like 25 minutes before i realized and the second time like 15 minutes LOL...that really sucksss buttttttt! but anyway suprising enough the phone still works! my only thing is the camera doesnt work any more :( I figured since the camera was never or good quality i was going to use my other phone to take pics and bluetooth the pics to post on fb and stuff BUT the SD slot got messed up too due to the water damage and when I try to bluetooth pics it says CONNECTION FAILED NO SIM or something like that. Any way I am glad BlackFriday is in a few week I am going to by another phone..DEFINATELY Android, Touchscreen but with a better camera and something that supports the flash so I can watch movies from free websites.....This is a really nice phone though! Besides the camera not being able to take nice pictures. I would buy it again if the camera was better any way. It was nice for the two (2) months i used it. Oh and I found that it can be used without a sim to access the internet via WIFI. I am so not throwing it away I can add education android apps to it (not many because the internal storage sucks) for my kids, ebooks, games and other stuff! The speaker is still working fine also after being in water. So I can give it to my seven year old.....he doesn't need a camera ;)UPDATE****** Nov 23 2012So anyway its Black Friday and I am still deciding on a phone to purchase for Cyber Monday because like I said before my camera was not working! I just accidently clicked on the camera button while looking at some old pics  and guess what?! The camera came on and the SD slot works again! I actually took a few pics...viewed them in the gallary and went back to the camera and it still came back on :D!!! I want to do cart-wheels! Thats $400.00 saved in my pocket... although the camera is not all that good in dim lighting It will have to do for now. Or at least until i have $400.00 to waste which will not be anytime soon.....
