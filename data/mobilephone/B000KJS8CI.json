Never thought I'd like a Samsung before- Nice display. Will need a screen protector though.- Stable. No crashes, no lockups yet.- Bluetooth etc works without a single hitch- Switches between 3G and Edge seamlessly- Great sound quality. Also looks like there is better background noise reduction with this phone. (maybe a network feature. new vocoder?)- very lightweight. Lighter than the Verizon Q.- Decent camera. 1.3 MP with some cool effects.- Barely feel it in my pocket. Awesome.Cons:- Top of phone gets pretty warm against the ear during a long conversation (scary)- Wierd connector. Why can't Samsung go with a standard Mini USB?? Losers.- No wired earphone/handsfree with the phone.- Keys may be a little too close, for some people- How about a GPS chip in the next revision?- Can't enjoy the music unless you really get a stereo bluetooth headset.-Great phone in all, the shortcomings look more like trade-offs for the most part rather than defects. It is in my opinion a even call with the Q and if the Q came out on any other network  besides Verizon, I would seriously have had a tough call between the two.", "Date": "December 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best Smartphone on the market", "Author": "L. Lynch \"\u00d2\u00bf\u00d3~\"", "ReviewID": "R296KM9U4GXKO4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OverviewI purchased this Smartphone after 3 months of research. My criterion was that it had to play music via Bluetooth, had to have a windows mobile platform, and had to be comfortable. This phone satisfied all of them for the most part.There are a few cons to the phone, however; with the windows platform it will not be long until applications will come around to extend the functionality and fix problems. I'm a computer programmer and I'm currently working with the mobile platform to develop new programs with Visual Studio, hence the need for the windows platform. I can safely say that in the next couple of years we will be seeing some exciting new technology that will be developed with the new Smartphone and PDA's that run a platform like window mobile.The blackjack is an excellent device to introduce you into the Smartphone/PDA universe. With Blackjacks features for Email (3 different options to receive email w/ this phone), Instant Messaging, SMS/MMS, ActiveSync & MP3 player capability it's my opinion that the Blackjack is on par or surpasses any blackberry.Con Brief & Fixes1) Music plays on the speakerphone if you have no ear buds.First the music capabilities of the phone is excellent, however; if you do not want the entire world think that \"you like big butts\" when everyone hears your song \"Baby got back\" by Sir Mix-A-Lot coming from your Blackjack's speakerphone. I would suggest getting the wired ear buds or a stereo Bluetooth headset. After a little research I found out that if I wanted wireless music from my Blackjack I would have to have a Bluetooth headset that had a feature called Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and if I wanted to control the music from a Bluetooth device I would need Audio/Video Remote Control (AVRCP). The Blackjack has both capabilities so all I needed to do is to find a Bluetooth device with the same. I found two that are not big headsets: LG HBS-110 and Sony Ericsson Bluetooth HBH-DS970. I bought the LG HBS-110, I just bought it when I did this review so I can't tell you 411 on it yet but I can say that both devices WILL work with the Blackjack.2) The battery life of the phone is very poorCome to find out the new G3 network from Cingular takes a lot of power to maintain. For a music enthusiast, like myself, I am looking for longevity when it comes to my players batteries. So I did some searching and come across a small little hack with the Blackjack that will turn off that G3 feature so the batteries can last for up to TWO DAYS in normal use. Let me advise you now, if you do not know what you are doing when you are in the settings of the phone. You can seriously damage your saved data on your phone or even lose it completely. So, I advise that you get in, change what you need, and get out. Do not experiment unless you are willing to lose your phones data. On the main screen of the phone type the following:  *#1546792*#  the admin screen will appear, scroll down to selection \"3 Network & Call Settings\" and hit OK. Next, scroll down to selection\"5 Network Mode\" and hit OK. Next, scroll down until you see \"GSM\" with a black dot next to it. Then, push the soft touch button with the word \"Done\" on the screen associated to the button. Now exit the Admin Settings by hitting the Home button (the button with a picture of a house on it) and you're finished. In a few seconds you should see the icons on the top of the home screen change. Next to the signal bars you should see a picture of an antenna instead of G3. This little hack should extend the life of your batteries tremendously. Also, by changing the Network Mode you should NOT lose any functionality from the phone, the only change should be the speed at which you send and receive data on the network. If you do experience problems, reset the network mode back to \"Auto\" by repeating the above steps; then start your troubleshooting of the problem.", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Simply the best Windows Smartphone on the market", "Author": "Nicholas Stehle", "ReviewID": "R214QCU819PR7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cingular has shown its commitment to the Windows Mobile platform in releasing the Samsung i607 BlackJack Smartphone.  The BlackJack sports 3G data, superb voice quality, a full QWERTY keypad, a brilliant color display and Windows Mobile 5 with Direct Push via Microsoft Exchange, Service Pack 2.  It's thinner than the Motorola Q, sexier than the Treo 700 and gets reception in the remotest of cell hell holes.I've been getting near 1 megabit of bandwidth on Cingular's 3G network in the Little Rock, Arkansas market.  The voice quality of this phone is on par with most other bar phones on the market today.The only drawbacks are (a) it lacks full MS Office, and has a viewer package instead.  I can't imagine how anyone could actually edit a Microsoft Office document on their PDA, however... I'd have to be pretty desperate and (b) no touchscreen, but uses a wheel instead.It's about half the price Cingular is expected to charge for the Treo 700w, and has 90% of the functionality.  Direct Push works beautifully from my company's MS Exchange server, and battery life is better than most Windows Mobile phones.

Since my last phone was a RAZR, I was spoiled by the ultra slim form.  With this phone, it fits just as comfortably in my pocket as the RAZR, but with 10 times the power and productivity.The only thing missing?  Wi-Fi connectivity, but it probably would have resulted in a bulkier phone.Also, the phone didn't come with a traditional instruction manual, just a \"Quick-Start\" guide, so there has been a lot of trial and error with this phone, especially with regards to shortcuts and navigation.

My last phone was a RAZR that I bought when they first came out.  That phone was alright, but I really felt it was lacking features for the price I paid.The time came to upgrade and I decided I wanted a phone that had more features than my falling apart RAZR had.  The decision came down to the 8525 or the Blackjack.I chose the Blackjack.  The 8525 was out of my league for price.  After dumping $500 on my RAZR, I promised myself that I would never do it again.A warning to all!  If you have large fingers or have a tendency to fat finger things, you may want a different phone!  Definitely try before you buy if you fit this category.You will get the most ouf of this phone if you are technically savy.  If you aren't this won't exactly be a bad phone, but the potential of it will be limited compared to those that know how to \"hook it up.\"  I would suggest that if you aren't highly skilled with technology that you find someone with a Blackjack or Motorola Q that knows how to \"hook up\" their phone.  They can probably help you out a lot.Let me start off with my complaints.The directional pad in the middle takes some skill to use.  I have gotten better with it, but let me describe the initial frustration.  The way the buttons are laid out around the directional pad cause problems.  When clicking to the right I had a heck of a time keeping my thumb from pushing one of the button towards the upper right (labelled \"...\").  That button closes what ever you are doing in most cases.  I might be scrolling around a web page, touch the right side and BAM!! I am sitting at my homescreen again.  Then I have to go back into my start menu and open Internet Explorer again... and be much more careful the next time!  .To help those of you out there that may have a similar experience...  I have found the best way to use the central directional pad is to place your thumb over the OK button.  Tilt your thumb in the direction you want until the pad is depressed.  Avoid the natural instinct of pressing the center of your thumb on the side of the pad you want to.  Once you master this, only seldomly will you have trouble with closing apps.The only other complaint I have is the battery life as many have described before me.  The 3G network is taxing on your battery.  You can switch networks to significantly increase battery life.  I know you want 3G!  We all do!  What if switching between networks was simple?  It can be!  Do not fret, all will be disclosed!What you want to do is open up Activesync with you Blackjack plugged in.  Click the \"Explore\" button.  Double click the little PDA picture titled \"My Windows-Mobile Based Device\".  Open the Windows directory.  Find the bandsel.exe file.  Right click the file and create a shortcut.  This will likely place the shortcut at the very bottom of the file list.  Scroll down and find it.  Rename the shortcut to \"Band Selector\" or something to your liking.  Cut the shortcut and then paste it into \"\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Applications\".You have now created an item in your applications section (under the start menu) that will allow you to change from 3G network to the Edge network or vice versa.  Note: If the shortcut does not appear right away, shut your phone off and turn it back on.What!?!?  What did you say?!?!  You want to be able to switch networks easier?!?!?  OK!!  Now that we have a shortcut we can add it to speed dial.  Simply go into your Start Menu and choose Applications.  You should see the \"Band Selector\" icon you made in there.  Highlight it, and then click the right \"...\" button on your phone.  Select \"Add Speed Dial\".  Personally I chose 88 for my speed dial.  To access 88 for instance, just press 8 once then press and hold 8.  The network selection menu will appear!  Choose any speed dial you desire!Might I make another wonderful suggestion when you get this phone... Treat yourself to the program called Facade!  It is a marvelous program that will add a top notch Homescreen to your phone.If you get Facade, follow the directions to install it.  Then go to Start --> Settings --> Display --> Homescreen --> Click OK, and select Facade Wide!Find some screenshots or whatever, but it is the best Homescreen I have tried and I have tried many.The keyboard is a great feature.  There is no faster way to pump out text messages than with a full keyboard.  The keys are small and close together so it does take a little practice to perfect its use.  Hang in there!  You WILL get better at using it.Cingular Xpress mail is slick!  What can I say?!!?  You basically install a piece of software on your desktop computer that will slingshot incoming mail to your cellphone.  Corporate email from virtually anywhere with internet access is feasible.Get yourself Google Maps!  The newest Google Maps application runs great on this phone!If you don't have a Gmail account, now is the time to get one.  This phone will interface extremely well with Gmail using POP3 settings.  I would suggest doing a google search for \"blackjack gmail recent:username\".  This will reveal some webpages that will assist in setting this up.Once you hookup your phone, it is great!

I've resisted the crackberry for as long as I possibly could.  But no more...I did try out the Treo 680 and found it to be dated.  I remember using the Palm OS back in the late 90's and the Treo is still using it.  The Treo graphics weren't as sharp or crisp either.So I ended up with the Blackjack.  And I have to say that I'm really enjoying it so far.  The battery life was an issue or so I've read but I've found a way around it.  Just turn off the Bluetooth and you're fine.  Bluetooth eats the battery.  And while I work, I just keep the phone charged via the USB cable.  I have not had a battery issue since.That being said, the navigation controls are a little bit cramped.  I do find myself hitting the wrong button at times.  The OS is a little bit slow at times.  That's life.  Nothing is perfect and nor is this phone.  But it's pretty darn close.  I like the OS a lot.  I found out how to drag and drop files onto my phone.  I've got a 2GB micro SD card in here and listen to music at the gym with my phone.  I love being able to tweat pieces of the start menu just by using Windows and the USB cable to browse out to the phone.That being said, I'm very happy.  I've ditched my PDA and I walk around with my contacts 24/7.  Sending email from the road is a snap and I'm in touch more often than not.  I'd recommend this phone over the Treo in a heartbeat.  Can speak to the Blackberry but I will say the color on this phone is sharper than the Blackberry Pearl and 8730.  I also can't say whether this phone is better than the Cingular 8525.

Samsung really swung for the trees on this and the expectation was high. However no matter how good this phone looks on paper or industry reviews it simply fails to deliver. If you are a consumer that plans on using more then 75% of the features you will be disappointed. Here is why:Lets outline what 75% feature usage means: Phone, addressbook, email (either POP or Xpress etc) some, Calendar, To do's and organization, a bluetooth accessory plus maybe 10% of the day on streaming content and/or the occasional web surf (which you need to setup and maintain email). First. you will get about 4 hours, maybe less of battery power until the phone is completely dead. Add the second battery that is bundled with the purchase and maybe you can make a phone call on the way home from work. If you are used to other PDAs or blackberrys, you will HATE the navigation through the phone. Excessive menus make it hard to find a command quickly. Plus the scroll wheel doesn't scroll like a blackberry, therefore you can't use it to select everything on the page.Price for services is high.To get email,text messaging and have 'limited' streaming capability (meaning NOT HBO or XM) plus the basic phone package, will spend close to $150 a month depending on your personal preferences. While that might not be high for some, think about that plus cable plus home internet and then consider what your paying just to stay 'connected'.Even if you cut out the streaming content, cingular will try and convince you otherwise because while using the phone, its easy to stumble across a feature you are NOT paying for and get 'hit' with the bill at the end of the month. Cingular will not refund you for this under any circumstance. Look at the warning explained above in the product details: Warning: If you want to enjoy the full audio and video capabilities of your UMTS phone, please select a MEdia Max service plan option during checkout. If you do not sign up for a MEdia Max service plan option, you will be paying per KB when you use the over-the-air UMTS audio and video features on your phone (upwards of $10 per minute).Functionality wise, the Keypad layout is difficult to see. The numbers and the letters are all the same size on very small keys so I found myself just staring blankly for several minutes trying to figure out where my character was. Not saying you don't get used to it but be ready to hit the wrong character several times because of the close proximity of the buttons. I never had that kind of a problem on my blackberry.Additionally Samsung claims that the Balckjack can perform as a blackberry however, after I purchased it, I found it is not. You can communicate (limited) with a blackberry server, however you need to load a 3rd party client software on your computer and for it to sync your messages throughout the day the computer needs to be on and running. Plus any meetings and Tasks are lost completely. I really think Samsung should explain this better and I feel Samsung really wanted to release something big and crammed a whole bunch of features into a slim sleek package but never tested it with 'real' consumers with 'real world' type usage.I'll finish up with what they did do right. The phone is beautiful. Perfectly designed, a nice weight and contrary to another review it feels like a quality phone. (Minus maybe the small keys and the disfunctional scroll wheel) The screen is maybe not as big as others but that was the point wasn't it? To make a smaller PDA phone. However, fyi, the streaming video comes in at half the size of the screen resolution. Earpiece is good and clear. Over all dimensions blow away all others except maybe the Blackberry Pearl.

Compared to the Blackberry, the Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome (for me) and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially. On the plus side, the Blackjack has good battery life, the screen is excellent and it has the best reception I've ever experienced. The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink (ie: the numbers) began wearing off the keys. It's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable, especially when it's backlit. I called Cingular first, who passed me on the Samsung where, after 2 hours on the phone, I was told that my only option was to send the phone (my primary source of communication) to their service center and wait 3 weeks. To my surprise, they went on to say that, at their discretion, they might also charge me for the repair. I've read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that I've encountered this, I do feel it's worth considering.If you're thinking about a Blackjack, I encourage you to be aware that, for one, the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys, and, that you may well be on your own when it comes to service.

I read all of the reviews and went to the Cingular store planning to buy either a Treo 680 or an 8525.  After holding the two aforementioned beasts, I realized that there's no way I would carry a phone that large - I'm not a utility belt type guy, I like a phone that fits in my front pants pocket, but doesn't raise eyebrows while there.  After holding all three phones in my hand, I knew that the Blackjack was the one.I was a little trepidatious after reading some of the reviews here, but the Cingular store guy assured me that I had 30 days to return it, and matched Amazon's price.  So out the door I went with my new phone.After using it for two weeks, I love it!  It does just about everything my old Ipaq did and is an excellent phone to boot.  My favorite features:1) Email - that's what I bought it for in the first place, and the email feature works great with my POP mail accounts.  Someone posted below about how it deletes your emails as soon as you have read them...that's only the case if you configure it that way.  I initially hooked it up through outlook and outlook downloaded all of the emails from my pop mail accounts, emptying my webmail boxes.  I have since turned off outlook, and set up the pop accounts on the phone itself.  This way the email goes to the phone AND to the webmail boxes.  I only keep the last three days emails on the phone, but an additional copy is stored in the webmail box, so I can log on to the internet to read them.  I also have the POP email accounts configured to automatically check for new email every 15 minutes.  Easy and very functional.2) Internet - Cingular has a 3G network where I am and it is fast!  The BJ has a great browser, which lets me surf my favorite sites from anywhere.  The excellent screen makes the sites surprisingly readable, even though the text is small.  The added banus, however, was how easy it is to use this phone as a modem.  I can connect the BJ to my laptop with the USB cable, go to File Explorer>Windows>Internet sharing.exe and my laptop recognizes the BJ as a network device.  Combine that with the 3G network speeds and I have a decent broadband connection on the commuter train!3) Entertainment - I get bored easily, so I always need to be doing something.  I used to carry my Ipaq with me all the time, just to have games to play in the checkout line.  I stopped doing that years ago, but now I have the equivalent functionality in my phone (which I do carry everywhere).  It took a couple of days to get used to the stylus free operation of the Windows Smartphone OS, but after a little playing, I found out that it can do almost everything my Ipaq could.  I can read books using the free Mobipocket reader, and I have three novels currently loaded on.  I can listen to music or watch videos. or (My Favorite), I can play classic Nintendo games.  I was able to get the PocketNester application to work on the BJ, so now I can whip out Mario Bros, or Legend of Zelda or Tecmo Bowl wherever I am.  Cool stuff!  All this content requires more memory, but thanks to my friends at NewEgg, I was able to get a 1GB Micro SD for $13.ABOUT THE BATTERY LIFE: A lot of people have complained about the battery life.  Cingular included an extended battery and a new battery door with mine.  The extended battery makes the device a little thicker, but not in an uncomfortable way.  With the standard battery, the camera sticks out a little bit from the back of the device.  With the extended battery, the battery door brings the back of the device flush with the camera.  Still planty pocket sized.  I've never used the standard battery - so I can't comment on that - but the extended battery gives me about 2 days of juice under normal usage (about 1.5 hours of calls, 2 hours of email/internet, 1.5 hours of games, phone on standby the rest of the time).  I try to remember to plug it in every night, but when I forget, I have plenty of juice to get me through the second day.All in all, I couldn't be happier with the device, I will list a few cons, though.CONS:- Nonstandard headphone jack.  I'm used to it because my Ipaq did the same thing, but I really wish it had one!- Three button unlock.  I wish there was a better way to unlock the phone than having to click three buttons.  Two would have been fine.- Navigation (again Windows problem).  Some of the features take a lot of work to get to, like the internet sharing.- Lack of a clipboard - I really wish i could copy/paste (Windows again).", "Date": "February 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Phone but Needs Work", "Author": "Paul C \"Reiver\"", "ReviewID": "R2XLEJKSPC8UT7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "All and all It's not a bad little phone, The sound quality is good, reliable reception in places where other phones drop out... but there are some bugs.1.

It may appear in the contacts 3 or 4 minutes later (huh?!?) or not at all.

I get so mad waiting for the phone to react even though it only takes a few extra seconds it will sometimes miss key strokes and is just painful to use when it is so delayed.The blackjack is not as bad as the razr and navigating the menus is pretty quick. There is occasional slow downs if memory is low and you try to do something that requires several menus to go by in rapid succession (for example ending a call and then quickly pulling up contacts to make a new call will take like 5 seconds). HOWEVER, web browsing on this clunker is very very slow. Even with 3G the latency is horrible. You can expect very slow responses when going through multiple pages/frames, etc. If you want to download large files, it goes very fast. If you want to browse the web as quickly as on a computer, the blackjack is no way going to make you happy and it is quite frustrating in the number of pages that have to be refreshed/reloaded in order to load since many times it hangs.Using the Gmail app to check my Inbox takes about 40 seconds from main screen to seeing new messages but the amount of data (3G or EDGE or GPRS) is very small, the phone just can't process the data fast enough and the network's latency (or the phone's networking latency) makes this a very slow process.This is due to the phone, not the 3G speeds. The phone just doesn't have the computing power to load web pages quickly and make browsing the web the same as on a computer with just a smaller screen. It also doesn't come with a flash player which makes many websites have problems.Also I live right in the middle of Philadelphia and sitting on my couch I go from having 3-4 bars of 3G to four bars of EDGE even though I haven't moved.

I actually did not need one, but since I was going into a new contract, and I would not be able to buy another phone (free of cost) for another 2 yrs, I thought that I should go with the \"in thing\".I surfed the net and found a site where I got this phone for free without needing to subscrib for a data plan. I dont intend to use it for data much. If I do, I will pay per use. I just wanted a PDA Phone that would give me the flexibility of email et al and I could subscribe to a data plan when I think that I need to. The cingular people were charging me quite a bit for this phone with a required minimum mandatory data plan (without a data plan, it was exorbitant) and were sure that I could not get this phone for free anywhere without a data plan, that too added as a new line to my already existing other Cingular phone. Too bad for them........Ok, now for the phone.....I must say that as a first time PDA Phone user, I was smitten by the Blackberry Pearle for its looks and all. However, I have been falling deeper in love with this phone ever since I got it (about a week).PROS:- Excellent display- Very user friendly and customizable OS (I did not need a manual for most of the stuff).- Loud and clear ear piece.- Good signal strength. (This was the primary reason why I moved to Cingular. Earlier, I had a T-mobil and my wife had a Cingular, she would singals everywhere, but T-mobil sucks on that accunt).- Good keypad. The key pad comes up like a cluttered one with very small keys at first look. I was scared as I have fat fingers. But the keys are protruded so that I have never pressed a wrong key. Better that the big key plat key pad in my razor.- Even without using the data plan, I am able to use the calendar, alarm, internet and it helps a lot to keep me on track for my day to day activities.Ok another thing that I have read a lot about here is the bad battery life on this phone. I must say that I got 3 days from my first charge on the regular battery (not the extended one), with a talk time of about 2 hrs, fair amount of net surf (pay per use), and lots and lots of palying around. The first thing I did was swtiched off bluetooth and 3G. I will switch them on when I need them (I am sure this will drain the battery faster), but for now, I am good. (I will update this space about battery life, if I see it going down).So all in all, this phone is real good, looks real sleek (yes, even when compared to the Pearle).

Prior to the BlackJack, most recently a Palm Treo 650, and before that, a Blackberry. Compared to the Treo, the voice quality and overall reliability are much better (doesn't reboot every half hour). If you're someone who talks on the phone all day, the BJ might be a good choice, if you don't mind recharging every day. Our sales people really like it. It's lightweight and has a slim design. The guys love it because it looks like a sports car. Internet access is much faster than on the Treo, but still a bit sluggish and limited. I'm a heavy email/text user, and I must say I miss my Treo (nevermind how much I miss my Blackberry!). The BJ keyboard is teeny, unintuitive, and there is weird spacing between the sequential number keys. Even after months, I'm still not used to it. The email text on the screen is much smaller than on the Treo, the contrast is much worse, and it displays fewer lines of text (boo!). The charger slot on the side of the device has The Flimiest Plastic Cover Ever. It was hanging on by a thread after just 2 weeks of use. In addition, the battery life is quite poor, and I don't even have Bluetooth turned on. I have to recharge it daily, whereas my Treo or Blackberry could go a few days between charges.

I should have given it 3 stars not 2, but I can't change it.To upgrade your phone to 3 stars too you must do the following -1. Follow all of the battery-extending advice you can find.  Turn the brightness down, disable email synch in the evenings, turn off beaming, turn off bluetooth, limit the backlighting, use the extended battery, switch to Edge instead of 3G.  If you do this your battery life will be 3 days instead of one.2. Gripe - you cannot edit tasks with this phone, you can only change the title.  This sort of bugs me because I use tasks a lot in Outlook.3. The alarm is buggy - the snooze sometimes keeps going.  If you have a sleeping S.O next to you they will be annoyed when you head to the shower and your phone keeps beeping.4. I got a headphone adpater off Ebay for $5, now I can plug the MP3 player into anything.  It still annoys me that they didn't put a standard headphone jack on this thing, the adapter is one more thing to carry around with you.The rest of my review still stands, and Windows Mobile is still terrible.My original review:I've had this thing for two weeks.  Coming from the Blackberry 8700c, this phone is a big disappointment.  Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and I'm stuck with it.  All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.  Here's my list, good and bad.* Battery life - attrocious.  Use the extended battery, throw away the standard one.  Trust me.  Grade: D.* Navigation - cumbersome.  The keys are too small, the 5-way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally.  Workable if you don't have huge hands.  Grade: B* Windows Mobile - I hate it.  Why do applications not quit when you end them?  Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager.  The menu is pre-loaded with goodies to buy from Cingular, how convenient.  Grade: C+ if you bother to learn the shortcut keys.* Java is broken, Google email doesn't work.  Maps DOES work with the new version, thankfully.  Grade: C.* No standard headphone jack.  HELLO??  This is suppose to be an MP3 player, right?  Somebody explain to me why this is OK.  Grade: F.* Phone quality - Grade A.  Yes, they did something right.  The phone works great, reception is great, speakerphone is great.  Bluetooth is great.* Outlook & email - This is workable, but difficult.  You can write an email, you can edit your schedule and tasks, but it's not easy.  If Blackberry gets and \"A\" (and it does), Blackjack gets a C.  It doesn't synch notes, so if you're an Outlook Notes person you're just left out, sorry.  Why??* Hardware quality - Very good, B+.  The thing really feels solidly built.  The screen is vibrant and attractive.  The camera seems to work fine, although I may use it twice per year.In short, if you really want to get work done on your phone get a Blackberry.

I can echo the previous comments on the sexy form-factor and the utility of the phone. After custimizing the home screen, my fiance' played around with it and insisted on getting one too. Easy navigation is a big deal for her, and the sidebar feature (push and hold the scroll wheel) - which is customizable, as is most of the interface on this phone - was a big selling point.My phone came with the extended battery and cover included; that was actually a pleasant surprise. However be aware that it doesn't ship with a belt clip or case. You'll want to pick one of those up as well as a car charger and a microsd card.The phone is light and sleek w/ the standard battery, but the extended battery gives it a much nicer feel in the hand. My fiance' actually prefers it w/ the extended battery in, and she's got a strong bias for small phones.Of course it's not quite perfect. I have 2 major beefs w/ this phone:1. No Wifi. This is extremely annoying because the SGH-i600 in Europe has Wifi, and it is essentially the same phone.2. Battery life: not utterly miserable, I can go two days of regular use (texting, regular calls to the missus, minimal browsing) before the battery goes out.

Power button on top...then soft key...then star. Not very one-hand friendly.-Camera... 1.3MP of poor photography-Searching for contacts.

The menus are NOT as user intuitive as they could be, however, and I hope they'll revise them in a future iteration/upgrade.  They could have given more interesting choices in the included ringtones.  One fabulously annoying thing: the LOUD whooshing sound they included for the \"turn on\" and an equally noxious sound for the \"turn off\" of the device.  And all the other sounds can be changed or muted or added to, but not these.  You just can't get rid of them and that makes it astoundingly embarrassing when trying to turn your phone off at a meeting or in a conference.

First off this phone has the best web surfing i've seen so far on a small device.  It uses IE as its browser and you get the whole web page as you would expect to see it on your desktop computer.  I did find a few sites which hobble their content such as Schwab but then it gave you special pages with charts that you couldn't get on the blackberry.  Navigating is fairly easy using the scroll wheel.  Occcasionlly I noticed a few glitches.  Images were nice and sharp.  The Pearl on the other hand gives you the web page all broken up.  Photos were nice but graphs and images rather fuzzy. In terms of phone quality the Blackjack has a high quality speakerphone which was superior to the Pearl and overall sound quality on the handset was slightly better on the Blackjack.  The Pearl's great strength is much better email system that is easy to use and delivers the mail to you and it's there. And it's easy to manage.  I also found the operating system of the Pearl to be easier to navigate and to be more elegant. In terms of styling the looks speak for themselves and it's a personal choice.  The Blackjack comes with two batterries and even with it's extended thicker battery it has a nice feel and is not bulky in the slightest.  The blackjack's headset is annoying in that it uses a proprietary plugin where the battery charger plugs in which means you can't choose your own headset. I was somewhat disapointed in the game selections for the Blackjack but I'm sure this is a temporary situation. What else?  One big con for the Blackjack which may not bother some is that the radiation level for data appears off the charts in comparison to other phones.  I think this is because it's a 3G phone and the bandwidth demands mean a lot of wattage coming out.  I think the designers were aware as they seem to have made an attempt to redirect the radiation out the base back of the handset. This means the amount of radiation going into your ear may be lower.  But of course you still have to hold it when you're surfing. It's  just something that people should be aware. of and not necesairly bad.  It's the reality of wireless. I just wish manufacturers would focus on a solution.  The Blackjack keyboard is very nice.  The keys are a little small but not too bad.

So far it is my favorite phone.  My two previous phones were the Cingular 2125 and the Treo 650.I am glad to be back to a full keyboard -- I missed that a lot on the 2125, since I do more data input than actually talking on the phone.  It gets much better reception and the speaker is louder than on the Treo.  I plan to keep this one until they come out with one that has a better camera, a standard headphone jack, and gps.  Waterproof would be nice. :)Pros:  While the keyboard is cramped, I am able to use it effectively, especially with text prediction.  The signal is better than most PDA-style phones I have used.  With the extended battery it is not so thin, but the battery lasts me all day, even with bluetooth always on, listening to music while walking/driving, some text messaging, checking email every 15 minutes, and lots of calendar and task list input.  I only talk on the phone about 60 minutes each month, but it is the only phone for our household (no land lines), and I have not had a problem.Cons:  While better than the 2125 camera, I don't know why they didn't put one that can capture more megapixels -- the technology exists.  I would also like GPS in this phone -- similar smartphones have it.  It is almost impossible to read the screen in daylight -- have to search for dark shade to use it outdoors.  My biggest issue is that there is no standard 2.5 headphone jack.  I cannot use earbuds, the adaptors seem to be hit or miss on getting one that works well, and BT stereo headphones are really heavy.  For a phone marketed as part music-player, this seems downright silly!But, I love my phone!", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Samsung Blackjack", "Author": "Cards Fan - Cody", "ReviewID": "R3RUVYMF57GV8W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me first say that I'm not a business professional, I'm a college student. Email and internet usuage is not a big issue for me. I mainly liked the blackjack because of the full qwerty keyboard for texting. I originally had a nokia 6010 (eeck) and then a motorola RAZR. While the razr was good for its day, it recently became unresponsive.I have \"tested\" many phones. The Nokia E62, was a great phone, but too bulky for me. I will say that I love the blackberry Curve and the Pearl, just a bit pricey for a college student. :) The AT&T; 8525 is also a great device, I love the touch screen and the sliding keyboard. For cost benefit the blackjack was the way to go for me.I will admit that Windows Mobile 5 has a bit of a learning curve, and the inculded manual is not much help, so just like any other new phone, I just started messing around on it and most of it came to me in about a week. The camera is a bit choppy but it still has good quality. The use of third party programs and be done on the blackjack. All I have now is the Bible, but it works flawlessly. If you are a big texter (like me) you will love how fast you whip up those messages.I can't comment on email and internet usage because I don't use those features. I live in an EDGE area so trying to comment on a 3G phone wouldn't be relevent. Overall a good product that some will either hate it or love it. I for one, love it. So give that 30 day chance and if you don't like it, just send it back.***UPDATE*** 07/09/2007As far as battery life goes, I am using the included extended battery.

At the time of this writing I have owned my BJ for only 24 hours and I am having fun learning how to stay organized, play my favorite music, and actually hear people who call my phone.The quality on the external speaker is excellent. There is zero distortion of music as it comes through the speaker which is on the back of the phone. I love the fact that you can play music between calls and there is an option to have the music continue where it left off after you receive a call. Phone reception is the best I've experienced in a cell phone, ever. I noticed right away that I could hear callers much better than I could on my Motorola Razr; that is a big plus. The speakerphone option is also an added bonus and it too is crystal clear.WINDOWS MOBILE 5 was the selling point for me. You don't need special software to get your favorite music, email, or organizational tools. It's already on your computer and all you have to do is load the Samsung Blackjack disc that comes with your phone. I reccomend getting this done right out of the box. Then all you have to do is perform your initial synch to set up your Outlook Calendar and contacts. There are also a few trials on the disc that may be of interest, like NotepadSynch so that you can save the notes you write yourself on your BJ onto your computer hardrive. Windows Media 10 on your PC is already set up to interact flawlessly with BJ media so programming music favorites is a cinch. I had no problems loading songs to my phone and its fast! You can also have a lot of fun using the Song ID. It will \"listen\" to a song as you play it from your radio or computer and allow you to store the artists' name and song info---how kewl is that! Warning, this feature can be quite addictive.I really like the camera quality on this phone. I was so frustrated with the Razr camera I just stopped using it altogether. Now I am looking forward to taking pictures and using them with CallerID. My only hangup is the fact that you can only access the camera via the START menu.

My business doesn't have a BES(blackberry mail) server so I decided to get the blackjack.It is a little complicated at first to get the hang of everything.  The navigation buttons are close together and I often hit the green or red call buttons on accident, which is annoying.  I also use the task manager way to often to close programs that have no \"exit\" function.  I would have given this phone 5 stars if it had built in GPS and wifi.I really enjoy this phone becuase of its applications.  I've found all sorts of usefull programs like Google maps, IM+, Fizz Weather, Facade.  You can really customize the homescreen a lot since its just xml.  I was able to setup my POP3 accounts easily and retrieve/send email with it all day long.  The battery holds out just fine for me as well.  I have yet to use the extended life battery.  Docking with my pc works everytime and is easy to use.  The phones reception is also great.  I kinda live away from the city and I still get clear calls and constant Edge service, sometimes 3g.  I have movies and mp3z as well and both play great.  The speaker is good for me.  I don't usually play loud mp3s in a room full of people...I bought a 2gb microsd card for $26 at Brandsmart and it works fine.  I also got unlimited data from AT&T; for $19.99 a month, so I'm not sure why I see others complaining about paying $40 a month.  The camera on this thing is great as well.

After carrying around the BlackJack (BJ) I knew there was a better way. I carry it around in my coat pocket and don't even realize it is there. The only thing that took me a while to accept is the fact that I can't just tap on the screen of my BJ and add a calendar item. I used to do this all the time with my Treo 650 and it took a while to be at peace with having to tap a few buttons/keys in order to do the same thing on the BJ. One application, which is totally worth the $15 or so dollars I spent on it, is SBSH Facade. This creates a home screen that is much user friendly than what comes with the BJ.The Blackjack is great, especially with the unlimited data plan. For the first few months I did not have the plan and did not take advantage of it's features. But, let me tell you, the internet on this thing loads up very quickly! I get my outlook e-mail and calendar synchronized in real time in no time! I am amazed at the speed! Previously I had the Treo 650 with Sprint for 2 years, and I hardly ever used the internet explorer and the phone for e-mail since it was so slow, and the screen was only ok, the screen on the BlackJack is amazingly clear. I can read the smallest print! I might not be able to add a calendar item in a two-step process as I could with the Palm version of the Treo, but the extra few steps are worth it given the speed of the Blackjack and the much, much lighter phone.

Sorry Win2k users (forget NT or Win9X or Me), video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP.  Get a MicroSD card and put your music on that card and you can play it from there.  Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of internal memory.

There's no disputing that.That said, it does have a LOT of quirks... Allow me to share some of the quirks with you. (Most of it is Windows Mobile 5 related.)- Cannot run Java based Gmail client app.- You CANNOT voice dial! (Unbelievable but true. Even with the $39 MS add-on software.)- Saving new numbers using the phone's UI is incredibly painful.- The directional key is tricky.- Using \"Profiles\" to set ring level & vibration is also painful. You can't just press the side keys to increase the ringer level and enable/disable vibrate.- The reception \"bar\" indicator is misleading.- If you have too many applications open, things slow down!- Getting ActiveSync to work thru Bluetooth is near impossible.- Cingular makes it very hard (and expensive) for you to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem.The basic phone functions that you took for granted are implemented in such a clumsy manner. Most of it is attributed to the Windows-like interface. Microsoft has had 5 revs of Windows Mobile and still, the killer-app (calling someone and receiving calls) is still so clumsy. It's simply unbelievable; no inexcusable.Bottom line: Cheaper phones will do a better job of quickly dialing and saving new numbers than this device.

Here are the cons to the Blackjack:Cons:1.  The phone takes 10-15 seconds when I press Contact List for the list to load. I confirmed this with another fellow user at Spring VON 2007 last week.  Can you imagine what it is like to wait 15 seconds while driving or trying to get a name. Engineers have 100 contacts. Users have 1000's. When people ask me why I do not recommend the phone, I tell them to watch, press contacts, and hold the phone up to them.  They are usually tired of watching by the time the contacts load. Samsung tech support acknowledged this is a problem with the phone.2.  Windows problem: When you type Jim or Bill all kinds of names come up. Even though Blackjack has a full key pad the software thinks you are typing numbers not names so it brings up abc letters associated with dialing \"1\" if you are typing a, b, or c.  Ridiculous!  Must have been designed by an engineer.3.  I can not view Youtube views or blip.tv or dave.tv or brightcove videos on my Blackjack.  Even with Adobe Flash lite 2.14.  The Blackjack is slow going from one program to the next. I think the Blackjack has a software hardware integration problem.  Sometimes you have to wait 10-15 seconds until you can access the phone to get to Call History for example.  The phone is busy waiting for another program to finish up.5. Often the phone will go off line and you can not get on the internet. It requires rebooting.  Others on line have complained about it.6. Battery life is like having a flashlight that dies before you get to the end of the trail.7.  I figured out the ActiveSync problem after days of effort.  Also loading contacts was wierd. I first had to uncheck contacts, load all the other information, then check contacts and load it. I found this hack ona forum.  Samsung tech support have not a clue about the hack issues.8. The screen is really too small for heavy email use.9. The key board is too tiny for lots of use.10. There is no WiFi on it - a must, WiFi dramatically changes your experience of using a Smartphone or PDA11.

One of my co-workers upgraded, so I bought this phone from her & used it to replace the Flight. I love the durable design & the qwerty key pad. It makes sending texts so much easier. In addition, I prefer to navigate the screen using the keys instead of using a touch screen. Some touch screen phones tend to have a delay, which drives me crazy when I'm trying to scroll to something in a hurry. The sound comes across loudly too.While I like this phone, I didn't give it a perfect 5-star rating. The draw backs are the battery life tends to dwindle faster when you are talking excessively. I normally will keep my phone plugged in while I'm talking just to keep from dropping the call. Sometimes when the battery gets low, the phone doesn't give you a loud warning while you are talking.The other drawback is repairwork. The phone I got had a problem with the micro SD Memory card port. When I inserted my micro memory card, it didn't register as it being in the phone. After a while eventually the charge port began to have issues too. I would plug my phone in & it wouldn't even acknowledge that its charging. As a result, I had to use another phone. When I took it to repair shops, they told me that they would have to do some significant soldering to replace the part, which is connected to the board inside the phone. I'm going to have to order another phone like it.Not a bad phone to own if you prefer not to have a touch screen phone.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy", "Author": "rudolf haak", "ReviewID": "R3P7DM0QZ80YIZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just got it asked for a unlocked phone.

I just got it a few days ago and let me tell you it blows my Nokia 6620 (also a Smartphone) out of the water.  The phone is great.  It has great reception, quadband, yadda yadda (why restate the specs when they are right up above this review anyways?!)Battery life seems decent - I have yet to use the phone for a full day as I just activated it yesterday.  Amazon.com fails to tell you that you actually get two batteries and an external charger/case for the second one.The only problem I have with this phone are the buttons - and I'm not talking about the tiny qwerty keyboard; that's just fine for my fingers.  I'm talking about the send and end button - the end is more of a problem.  If you are doing anything with this phone while on a call with someone, be careful as you may accidentally hang up on them.  The buttons should have been raised or something, and made a little smaller so they aren't touching the rocker pad.  The back button does take a little getting used to as well.  Sometimes you will expect it to take you to the last screen you saw and it will end up dumping you back on the Today screen - not a big deal but still a minor annoyance.As far as the \"number spacing\" it's not a problem.  Actually it's a feature.  What Samsung has done with this phone is set 2 buttons on the keypad for every number (except 0, *, and #).  The letter directly to the right of the number you want will also activate that number when dialing a number on the phone.  You can even press down both keys at the same time and it will only register as one button press.E-mail setup was a breeze.  I am using the built-in POP setup for GMail, and I have Yahoo! Go also set to sync to the phone. The sheer number of applications available for this phone give anyone who buys it lots of flexibility and options.  Just beware that The MIssing Sync still seems to have a few issues (not sure if it's with the phone or not - I can't sync my address book through it, cause of some retarded error).Pros:Easy to useComes with 2 batteriesVery flexible due to all the applications available for downloadLook at the specs 'cause I am too lazy to list the rest.Cons:Back button takes a little getting used toSend/End buttons are too easy to accidentally press.I am giving this phone 4 stars due to the problem with the send and end buttons.  I'm sure I won't always have a problem with this, but Samsung could have designed it a little bit better.  All-in-all I am very happy with my \"purchase\" (well, I got the phone free, but I would still buy it if I wasn't offered it free [I know people are gonna hate me for that =P].)

Spotty service on 3G and EDGE, inability to make notes (making the keyboard on it pretty useless unless its solely for texting), complicated interface, frustrating menus, and low speaker volume.  The volume is a really big gripe with me.  At it's loudest setting, I miss almost every single call I get when in the car, no matter which ring tone I use.Bluetooth headsets are pretty frustrating as well, the phone doesn't supports voice-dialing, and if you have many contacts, better pull off to the side of the road to scan through them all, dial, turn on/connect the headset, and you're ready to go.  Yes, you'd save time by pulling over to find a pay phone.Then there's AT&T;/Cingular's service.  These are \"special people\" folks.  Even a year after its release, they know nothing about the Blackjack.Want some navigation?  Try using GoogleMaps or the TeleNav system AT&T; wants to sell you.  I bought it, tried it, but nothing happens.  Apparently, there's no built-in GPS in the phone.  What?  A smart phone with no GPS?  You heard right, what they don't tell you after signing up for TeleNav is that you also need to buy a $100 GPS add-on.  Then pay the monthly fee.  Got it?  You're better off buying a separate portable GPS system for under $200; you'll save a ton of money, believe me.Also, the phone takes awhile to boot-up and shut down and the speaker phone isn't very loud on it's loudest setting (unless you're sitting in a quiet room).So what's the good thing about this phone?  Well, it looks nice and shiny.  The screen is nice and big.  It takes good pictures and video.  It will play MP3s (but the volume will cripple you, unless you have the headphones with the special connector--no standard headphone jack here).  Oh, and sometimes you can even make phone calls!  Isn't that neat?Bottom line, if you want a phone with a built-in GPS, a notepad feature, voice-dialing via Bluetooth, decent volume, and a good signal, then avoid this one!PS: I'm not even mentioning the battery life or the WAY too small keyboard.", "Date": "August 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Does any body know if I cancel the PDA service", "Author": "Y.
