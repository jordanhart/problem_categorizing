Already I am starting to enjoying this cell phone, because its a lightweight, medium size cell phone like the size of a computer mouse that's easily to fit into my pans pockets while I am are traveling in car or walking. So, come-on. I mean, this is a helluva cell phone to get. It gots a 2.0 megapixel camera video recorder that shows pretty good videos and takes pretty good pictures. Also It haves an outstanding built in mp3 player with great sound quality, and I mean great sound quality. Down load app for face book, twitter, google, ect, but as you know need a micro sd card. So, if you are on a budget this is the cell phone to get, I guaranteed that you'll be satisfied with everything this particular cell phone haves to offer.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cheap touch screen, great price", "Author": "0rvodragon", "ReviewID": "R1W42L3UK0S7WV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone from Net10 for a while now, well into a month. I have used it constantly, from calling and texting to browsing the web and playing the cute games on it. Now, its not the top-of-the-line phone, meaning its browsing is limited, with little picture graphics and no easy way to watch videos. However, if you want to look at the weather, it is not only available, it has a speed link in the browser for it. Sound is good, especially with alarms, music, and incoming calls. Also, like Jeff Foxworthy, its hard to get rid of a cheapo. This phone is no exception. It drops onto bathroom tiles from a good height and has no problems, while I have seen a smartphone fall from a similar  height and shatters the screen. Word of warning, though, due to the touchscreen, you may accidently launch the phone's browsing tool, which will cost you minutes.Now the only problems I have with this phone are as follows:1) While browsing, the phone doesn't have a keyboard option for typing. This is kind of irritating seeing as you can have a keyboard while texting.2) For some odd reason, the background will reset itself. This, however, was close to my renewal date for my plan, so the events may be related.3)There are only two installed themes, either cartoon or black. I don't know if its just me, but I have technical difficulties when trying to find more.In short, this is a good, cheapo touchscreen. Its loud, its versatile, and its sturdy. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone thinking of going into Net10's unlimited plan.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "If you can't afford an iphone..get this phone!", "Author": "Janeway", "ReviewID": "R3IM3HONTN690B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am extremely impressed with this phone! I can not afford, and never will be able to afford an iphone.  This phone is what I imagine an iphone to be like.  It goes on the web easily and quickly.  Great responsive touch screen. It has a camera, which I find to be sufficient.  It's an MP3 player--I transferred all my songs to it.  Great sound quality, while making calls.  This is my 1st \"smart phone\" and it is SUPER EASY to understand and use. Battery life has been great so far--I've had it for 3 weeks now, and have charged it two or three times. You can even download ebooks--although a very limited selection--that I have found anyways.  I bought it for $25 at a black Friday Sale, but it is EASILY worth the $50 retail price.  I'm even thinking on getting my 2 teenage kids each one for Christmas.Absolutely adore this phone!!!  Highly recommend it as a cheaper version of what I can only imagine an iphone to be!  Buy this phone--you will love it, if you can't afford an iphone:)", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Absolutely best bang for the buck phone", "Author": "Papa Miguel", "ReviewID": "R2BF0IMOM5LVH7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to replace an older non-touch screen Net10 phone that had served me well for the past year. I purchased it because I wanted a camera, a calendar, and something to play my mp3's, but I abhor phone contracts. I didn't need anything too special and I'm not much of a texter, although I think this phone does well at that. I also don't have a data plan. I've had it for a few weeks, now. There are a lot of nice little extras for me that made this phone a steal at $40. I'm using hardware version 1.0, software version V10e. Here are my impressions:- Sound: Calls for me were nice and clear. Never had to push it hard against my ear to hear. It also has a speaker that has plenty of volume.- Battery: It's pretty solid. I don't make a ton of calls, but I do use the mp3 player a bit. I'd say most people will probably have to charge it every 3 days or less often. A little more often if you're constantly playing music like me.- Music Player: Sound is excellent. However, the player, itself, is somewhat primitive. Playlists are limited to 100 songs or less. So, I just play from the main library. One nice thing I liked over the iPod is you can delete songs.- Calendar and Tasks apps: Excellent. It's really easy to schedule things, you can put alarms, of course, and even schedule recurring events either daily, weekly, monthly, or annually.- Camera: The camera is easy to use, but the images suck. I won't lie. And I can confidently say it's the phone's image processing. The biggest problem is things come out blocky, although the lighting isn't too bad. It says it's a 2 MP phone, but I've seen phones with way fewer pixels that can take better images. So, this thing is more for things like catching wacky moments or taking pictures of your contacts, but don't plan on using it for special moments. It can also take crappy video, for what it's worth.- Touchpad: It's fine. It requires a heavier touch than an iPhone or Android (which we, really, shouldn't be comparing to), but once you learn to apply a little more pressure it responds well.- Look and Feel: I actually really like the look and feel. The pictures on the ad don't do it justice. It's a cartoony feel but it's pretty polished and is really fun, I think.- Text Input: This is, absolutely, the most head scratching feature of this phone. For texting, you have the option of using a full qwerty keyboard. Nice! However, for everything else that requires text input they give you a regular phone keypad. So, entering contacts is a bit of a chore. Whatever.- App screens: You have 2 screens - one for contacts and one for the apps you want to use. You just swipe back and forth to access them. Don't know how this compares with other phones in this price range.- Extra stuff that I haven't tried, yet: Bluetooth, Voice recorder, Browser- Quirks: When you make a call the phone touchscreen goes into locked mode. To unlock you can either press the power button or hold a little lock symbol on the touchpad. However, during a call once you unlock it it will lock back up after about 3 seconds after your last action. That becomes kind of annoying when you're on the phone with a computer that requires you to enter dialpad commands every 8-10 seconds (voicemail).Overall, like the title says, I don't think you can find a better bang for the buck. I've said a few negative things in the review, but despite those things this phone functions really smoothly. Some people absolutely need an Android or an iPhone. So I say go get that iPhone or Android! This phone is definitely no substitute. But for what it offers at the price and without a contract this phone will be an awesome companion.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just right for the price!", "Author": "niky", "ReviewID": "R13I6AWJTQ9JJ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the phone works awesome and can have free apps. facebook google weather, i would never spend the money on a fancy iphone or other touch screen because i just dont do that, but for 35 bucks this phone is awesome. works great i absolutely love the phone worth every penny, i'd buy it twice", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dump your contract and get one of these great phones and Net10!!!", "Author": "J.", "ReviewID": "R352TXQEID564W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I highly recommend this phone to anyone.  One of the best phones I have ever owned. I even got my Mom one of these and she dumped Verizon too. She took a few weeks to get use to the touch screen, but would not turn loose of this phone now. Great phone and Net 10 service is really good too. The only thing is the battery is a little short on life, but just buy a car charger set from Amazon.I absolutely love this LG800G! It takes a little getting use to a touch screen from a flip phone, but after a while it is easy to use and great reception. I think it is so nice not having a contract and I pay $50 a month for unlimited talk, text and web.I was a Verizon customer for many years, a VERY UNHAPPY Verizon customer.

The phone itself works well. Good speakers on it make it easy to hear. Without headphones the music play louder then I thought it would. As others have said it's \"half a smart phone\". I get the 750 minute for 30 day plan. Web access is limited to mobile web. But is still decent enough to check your Face book through their FB app. You can also check Gmail and the weather.The phones battery life is great to average depending on how much you use it. As a phone only, it's great. Phone plus music is good. Phone plus music and web, average. You can get a 4 gig memory card to upload your own music and take many more pictures.The camera on it works well enough. For basic photos it's works well. After taking photos you can make them your background or incoming call background etc. The video fuction is poor. I'm not sure why they even bothered with it. All in all a good phone for the $25 30 day plan. Not really worth the $50 30 day unlimited plan.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone, especially at the price I'm getting!", "Author": "Hao Zhang", "ReviewID": "RECYJBCNGYF3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for use as a backup/spare phone, in case my fancy schmancy Android phone goes out of whack. For $35, it's not too shabby. It costs $50+ with shipping anywhere else, so this was a great deal on Amazon by shopcelldeals.The touch screen is pretty sensitive, it doesn't require a lot of hard pressing unless you encounter a tiny object that needs a bit of accuracy. It uses a resistive touch screen, so it's not going to be comparable to a capacitive touch screen found on fancy touch screen phones, like Android phones and iPhone/iPod touch/iPads. I found it very surprising that the screen was so sensitive; from my previous experience with resistive touch screens, they require me to jam my thumb down on the screen to operate, but this phone had no trouble with the touch operation at all. Using the virtual QWERTY keyboard at first was a bit hard for me since I use an Android phone and an iPod touch 4G, but after getting used to the touch screen, it was easy to type.The features on this phone are quite fulfilling. There are a few smartphone-esque features on this phone, such as a home screen with widgets, a lock screen (sort of), and apps/games capability. The web browser appears to be a full HTML browser; it's easy to navigate around the web, but there is no video streaming capability (YouTube). The music player is pretty good on this device, it scans for all the songs you downloaded to the phone/memory card, and compiles them into a list. The speaker is loud and clear, a lot louder than my Android phone (10/20 volume on this phone is louder than full volume on my Android phone), so this phone is great for anyone who likes to use their phone as a boombox/stereo.The phone comes preloaded with 2 games, Container Block and Castle Defense. Container Block is quite entertaining, you have to find ways to move your container out of the area by moving other containers out of the way. I haven't played Castle Defense yet, but I'm sure it will be just as fun. You can download Java (J2ME) apps onto this phone, by either using the built-in web browser to download directly from app distribution sites, or transfer .jar files to your phone/memory card, then opening the file on the phone. You can use websites such as GetJar, MobileRated, etc. to get apps and games. The games won't be as fancy as smartphone games, but there are some classic games such as Tic Tac Toe, Tetris, and Pac-Man that you can play. I would recommend downloading Opera Mini so you can browse the web better, because the built-in web browser has a few issues with memory and doesn't have some of the features found in Opera Mini.The camera will get the job done for occasional snapshots on-the-go. It's a 2 megapixel camera, so don't expect it to take SLR quality pictures or videos. It also doesn't have an LED flash light, which is understandable since this is a low-end phone. Like any other cameras built into phones, it is horrible under low-lighting conditions, so it's best to just stick to taking pictures under bright light. In order to use the digital zoom option for taking photos, you would have to tune the size down to VGA quality (640x480). The video it records are somewhat decent; again, do not expect it to be high quality. The camera has a few settings such as brightness control, white balance, color effect, timer, continuous shot mode, night mode, etc. so you can shoot photos and videos with a few preferences.Now let's just get on with the miscellaneous stuff. The phone has common tools and utilities like calendar, alarm clock, calculator, tasks and memo pad, stop watch, world clock, voice recorder, and even a unit converter. There's two pages on the main menu, so be sure to swipe over to find the rest of the apps. The battery is a bit small, only holding 900mAh; it's not too bad since this isn't a fancy smartphone, it doesn't use as much power. The phone runs on AT&T; towers, and their EDGE service (theoretical max speed is around 240Kbps, most people only get around half of that). I get 4 to 5 bars most of the time at my house, so if you have good AT&T; reception at where you live, you're good to go. You can send and view MMS messages, so that's not a problem there. You can transfer contacts from another phone by either mashing them into a .vcf file, which is a feature found on most feature/smartphones; or you can transfer them to your phone via Bluetooth.This is a good feature/semi-smart phone for someone upgrading from another feature phone, or using it for a spare phone. It will get the job done if it fits your need, but don't expect it to be comparable to true smartphones (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, etc.)", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Worst Phone Ever", "Author": "M. Harris", "ReviewID": "R1TEVBU3NWHAD6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The rating of this phone really depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for an Android, look somewhere else. But if you are looking for something that is like a smartphone in some ways, this is the choice. Personally this is not something I would love and cherish, but if you don't want a fancy phone then this is a good idea. It has internet, texting, and you can download a facebook app. This in some ways is a more basic phone, because it cannot play Youtube videos, nor can it use wifi, and it doesn't have 3g or 4g speeds. And the thing is, it doesn't let you use the on-screen keyboard with the browser. I still can't understand why not, but trust me because of this you will get annoyed. You have to use the keypad, which is like when you dial a phone number, press 1 for letters a,b, or c. Press 2 for e,d, or f. You will find it can get quite annoying. The texting works well, and it does allow you to use the keyboard. You see, this is emulating Androids and iPhones because it has a virtual keyboard, not a slide-out one or anything like that.The facebook app can be tricky at times, and every time you use it you have to switch from the keypad to the keyboard. I don't understand why it just doesn't give you the keyboard to begin with. But maybe that is too much like an Android. There are a few useful things on this phone, like a stopwatch, alarm clock, unit converter, calculator, etc. While this may have the facebook app available, there are not many others. So if you want a phone with apps, do not get this one.Sometimes this phone can act weird, like sometimes the facebook app doesn't work, sometimes it acts weird during texting. I find that my signal goes up and down. Whenever it has all bars, it is fast. But when it has only a few bars, things are really slow. Battery life is okay, but there are plenty of other phones that get better battery life. There are a lot of cases available for this phone, which is a good thing. The touchscreen itself is okay, but not nearly as nice as an iPhone.So compared to an iPhone or any Android, this phone is a joke. But for someone who wants a cheap touchscreen, this is the one to get. The call reception is pretty good too. There are several plans available, all which you have to buy cards for. The most amount of minutes you can get is 750, but there is also an unlimited plan. But with this phone, that really seems like a waste of time. And you will find that the minutes go by fast, especially with texting.Update 5/13/2012I am so glad I switched to the LG Optimus. It may not be the best phone in the world at all, but at least it is better than this phone. I still have this phone, and I, just for the heck of it, turned it on. It's so inferior to an Android device. The minutes went by so quickly, I could never do the large amount of texting I do now. There is an unlimited plan, but why pay $50 for such a cheap device? There are plenty of far better prepaid phones out there for that amount or LESS! The touchscreen is terrible, even my Optimus has a better screen. In fact, its screen is very sensitive, I don't wish for it to be any more sensitive than it already is. But this phone, you cannot type fast, and you always have to turn the screen to use the keyboard. I would suggest you go with a slider phone instead, it is a much better option than this touchscreen. If you want a touchscreen, go with any Android from any prepaid carrier, there are some really nice ones out there, especially at MetroPCS.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "A very cost

Tracfone has been a perfect phone for this level of use. 1 year service is around $100 and you can roll over unused minutes year to year. The minutes do not expire as long as the service is extended before the expiration date. I purchased a LG800G phone to replace an 6 year old phone that stopped working.\u2714 To transfer the old number and minutes--------------------------------------------1. Before activating and transferring the old phone number and left over minutes, the new phone needs to be charged.2. You can activate the phone on-line (if you have an on-line account with Tracfone AND if your old phone is operational). To do so go to Tracfone home page and choose \"Activate Phone\" link at the top of the home screen, and then selecting \"Transfer my number and service from one TracFone to another\". Since the old phone was not working I called the service representative 1-800-867-7183.3. To do the transfer you will need the IMEI number (also known as the serial number) of the old phone, the SIM card number of the old phone, and the old phone number. You will also need the serial number of the new phone which is printed on your activation card.4. I had no issues getting full credit for all the old minutes. To activate the phone the operator had to give me five long series of numbers and even though the call center was in India I had no trouble understanding the accent and found the operator pleasant and easy to work with. The first procedure she performed gave me credit for half of the minutes on the old phone, and then without me having to ask she said she needed to do several more steps to get me the balance of minutes. I had to turn off and turn on the phone twice to see minutes added in two steps.5. The software version I received on the phone purchased in February 2013 is V10e. The older version of the software had problems (specifically version V10d).You can check what version of the software you have by clicking on a blue square with 4 dots on the main screen. Then tapping on the following: Settings - Phone - scroll down to Information - Device Information - S/W version.If you have V10e or later you are all set. If you have V10d you have an older problematic version and should upgrade.I went to LG web site, found support page, and entered 800G. I found a page where there are steps to install software that performs an upgrade for the the phone. The instructions say \"If your phone needs to upgrade, the \"Start Updating \" button will be enabled.I did not test this because my phone is on the latest version already, but I wanted to see if LG had a page for updates and I found it. Amazon does not allow posting of external URL, but you can find it by going to LG web site and adding this \"/us/support-mobile/lg-LG800G\" to the home page URL.\u2714 What I like about the phone------------------------------------------1. I found the touch screen to be responsive, although it requires a little more pressure than the touch screens of my Android devices2. The screen is bright and easy to see. The phone size is 4\" (length) by 2.25\" (width) by 0.375\" (thickness). Screen size 1.75\" (width) by 2.25\" (length). 3\" diameter. It weighs 3.1 oz.3. This phone will be used by someone whose vision is not very good, and I was pleasantly surprised by many font size choices and how well the font scaled up without losing the usability of the menus and prompts.I am attaching a collage of five photos (which can be found by following customer photos link under the main photo). Photo #1 shows font options, Photo #2 shows a screen with font size set to medium size, Photo #3 shows a screen with large font.4. The price of this phone is hard to beat. This phone provided triple minutes for the life of the phone. That means when combined with 1 year service/400 minutes it is 1200 minutes for $90 (current price on Amazon including shipping), which is 7.5 cents per minute. Or for someone who uses a phone less than 400 minutes a year (which is the case in our family), then it is $7.50 a month for the security of having an emergency phone.5. The phone has a small set of useful apps: a calculator, a notepad, an mp3 player, and few others. Using these apps does not use minutes. If you use the browser then the minutes are used as soon as you connect and stop when you disconnect.6. A charging connector is a standard micro USB connector. I have been able to charge this phone using my own cables, so if you already have a car charger or an external battery that uses a standard USB connector you don't need to buy anything special to use it them with this phone. The charging port on LG800G is on the left side of the phone and is covered by a small panel which you need to lift up and turn 90 degrees to expose the connector.\u2714 Customization I have made---------------------------------------(1) I increased the screen time out. This is done by hitting a blue squares with 4 dots (also known as the Menu icon) and then selecting 'Settings'. From the 'Settings' screen select 'Phone' and then 'Auto-lock'. You can choose a time between 10 sec and 60 sections or 'Never'. If you select 'Never' the screen will dim but will not lock. The downside of 'Never' that if something in your purse accidentally presses on the screen you could be dialling or starting up a browser without meaning to do so.(2) I removed the browser from the main screen to the apps bar (so it would not be hit accidentally start using minutes). And added \"Profiles\" to the main screen, which allows to change the phone into silent or flight mode quickly.(3) I populated the contacts, and then added several numbers to the speed dial. Once the speed dial is set you will be able to access it by clicking the phone icon on the main screen, and then hold down the number of your speed dial. Speed dial #1 is your voice mail. Note that when you access your voice mail you get charged minutes. Speed dials also appear as individual buttons on the screen on the second page. To get to the second page you need to swipe your finger across the main screen right to left.(4) I changed the font of the display. This option is accessible by hitting the Menu icon, then 'Settings', then 'Display', then 'Font'.(5) I changed the ring tone. To get to this setting you need to go to the second page of Settings. Start with Menu, then Settings, then slide your finger right to left to flip the page, select 'My stuff', then 'Sounds'. The phone comes with 12 choices for rings tones.(6) You can activate and deactivate sounds by using the volume button. To do so you need to press and hold the lower portion of the volume button. You will get a brief message on the screen \"Silent activated\". If you press it again you will deactivate silence and get \"Silent deactivated\" message.\u2714 ADDING SD MEMORY CARD-------------------------------------The phone is operational without adding an SD memory card. The phone comes with some (relatively small) amount of internal memory. Information about your contacts, calendar, tasks & notes are stored in internal memory. If you are planning to take photos or videos, or listen to music, you should add an SD memory card. Note that your contacts, calendar, and tasks will continue to be stored the internal memory. I purchased this SD memory Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC Memory Card with SD Adapter.1. SD memory card slot is located under the battery. This means that you first need to remove the cover by sliding it down. The first time I had to remove the cover it was a bit difficult, as the cover is very slippery and has no groves to hang on to. I finally was able to do it by using the grippy material used to open cans. Photo #4 shows me removing the battery cover. The grippy material generated enough friction that the cover finally slid off. After removing the cover, you need to remove the battery.2. The memory card slot is on the left side of the white SIM card. The gold bars on the card should face down towards the gold bars on the phone. The memory card goes under a metal holder. You need to lift the metal holder, place the memory card, and then lower the card holder, and push it down until it snaps in place. Note that lifting the holder for the first time requires some force. I used a tiny screwdriver to give me leverage to push it up. Photo #5 shows the holder in up position, so you can see what you need to do to insert the memory card.3. After the memory card is in place, you need to replace the battery and the phone cover, and power up the phone.4. Now, you need to set your default memory to external, and tell the camera, the video recorder, and the voice recorder to use the external memory rather than the internal memory like before.5. To set the default memory:- Tap the following sequence MENU - Settings - Phone - Memory Info - Primary storage settings- Tap on External memory (red check will appear)- There will be a FORMAT button at the bottom of the screen, tap on it- The phone will ask for a security code, enter 0000. Once you enter the security code, OK button will appear on the bottom of the screen. Click ok. Format takes about 1 second.6. To set the camera:- Tap Camera icon on the main screen holding the phone vertically, turn the phone to horizontal position, as you turn you will see camera control setting appear on the screen.- Tap the gear icon which is on the lower left side of the screen.- The memory setting is on the second screen of camera settings, so you need to tap the slider on the right hand side (it will say 1/3, first page out of three) once you tap it will change to 2/3.- On the top row you will see a square called 'select storage'. By default it will look like a cell phone, once you tap it will look like a memory card.- Hit OK to save your change7. To change the video camera:- Tap Camera icon on the main screen holding the phone vertically, turn the phone to horizon position, as you turn the camera controls will appear- Tap the gear looking icon on the bottom left- Now you need to switch from camera to video, which is done by sliding your finger from camera to video camera icon on the right hand side slider- If you do it correctly, you will see a red button appear where the video camera is. If you do it incorrectly, you will take a photo. It took me a few tries to get the pressure and location of where my finger slides correctly.- The storage setting is on the second page of the video camera, so you need to page down on the slider by tapping on 1/2.- Tap on 'Select storage' icon, and make sure you see a memory card, rather than the cell phone icon.- Click OK to save your change8. To change the voice recorder- Voice recorder is on the second page of Settings. To get there select Menu - slide you finger right to left to page - tap on Voice recorder.- The top option is 'Storage', tap on it to change cell phone icon to memory card icon.- Click ok to save your changeOverall, the phone feels nice, the screen is easy to read, when I made a few \"test\" phone calls I was told that I sound very clear.  This is NOT a full featured smart phone like Android smart phones or iPhone, but it a very cost efficient way to have an emergency phone which can do a bit more than just phone calls.Ali Julia reviewUpdate 3/9/2013:  My original review stated that the thing that I like least about the phone is that its speaker phone is not loud enough to hear well without putting the phone next to your ear. However, since then I discovered that there is a setting which turns on the speaker phone, and with the setting on the phone functions well as a speaker phone.  To turn on the speaker phone press on \"speaker\" icon, this icon will appear when you are connected to the other side.  To turn the speaker off, click on the \"Speaker\" icon again.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME Phone! ... make sure you read my IMPORTANT Net 10 tips...", "Author": "Mtrappah", "ReviewID": "R3OYTG4NI7ESUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This LG 800G cell phone replaced a stripped-down little LG flip phone I'd had for two years or more (no camera, no bluetooth, no touchscreen)and so when the battery wouldn't hold a charge for longer than a day (on the old one) I bought this as a replacement.I have a land-line at home, so I've found Net10 to suit my wireless needs (I have roll-over minutes, and lots of them), soafter making sure I could retain that service with Net 10 on this phone, I took the plunge, and what a good plunge it was; are you kidding me? It's like night and day...IMPORTANT TIP: Net10 sends out this lame little brochure with the phone (and a wall Charger), so make sure you download the manual from the sellers website, or LG, or manuals.com.--It's the only way you'll be tutored all of the features and use it to it's potential.--It's very cool. BONUS: Amazon had it delivered to me in 2 days.LAST IMPORTANT TIPS: Contact Net10 phone Customer Service the minute you receive your new LG 800G, in order to provide them with the serial numbers to activate it. You need a new SIM card sent to you (free)-- You CANNOT USE THE SIM CARD that comes in the new phone! (Also applies to keeping your old phone number.)DO NOT,I REPEAT, DO NOT PUT YOUR OLD SIM CARD IN YOUR NEW LG800G; DAMAGE TO THE NEW PHONE WILL OCCUR!!! I read another review from a buyer who complained about Net10 changing the per-minute rate, and there's a simple solution; call them and verify what you want to do before you buy--if you have a contract they can't just change your rates arbitrarily.I think the key to all of this is to clarify your needs, verify them with Net 10, and learn the technology.

I transferred my phone number from my previous Net10 phone with no problems. Had my new phone working within one hour. Setup was easy and phone seems to work fine. Just one work of caution: I tried to set up my Security Code so that I could lock my phone for obvious reasons. There seems to be a factory code installed on the phone, because when I tried to enter/change the code of course I didn't know the factory code nor was it listed in the user manual (which is VERY basic). After three unsuccessfus attempts of entering a code I locked my phone and had to enter a PUK code which of course I didn't have either. I ended up going to the Net10 website wich luckily has a forum section, and apparently I'm not the first person who made this same mistake.If you've locked yourself out of your phone DO NOT attempt to unlock the phone and enter some random number thinking you'll enter the PUK code. After 10 unsuccessful attempts you will permanently lock your phone and will have to replace the SIM card. Go to the Net10 website and from there onto their forum page. You'll have to register as a member before you can request help from an admin. I received a reply within 10 minutes. They will ask you for your SIM number in a private message, but in order to reply in a private message you will have to have posted at least five new posts on any forum page. Not sure why they require such a thing, especially when you have such an annoying problem and need help NOW, but you will have to make those posts before you'll be able to send any private message back to the admin person. Once you can reply and you send that SIM number it wont take long and they will send you that PUK number to unlock your phone. They will also send you your factory security code (mine happend to be 1111), I was able to enter it and then change it to something of my choosing. Now I can safetly lock my phone.

Great feature for irresponsible kids, I guess. It is convenient for those who may only need to use it in emergencies, as I started with the $20/ 200 minute card, and they give you up to 90 days to use them up.  Rules are quite clear, and there appears no hidden small print.  Texts appear to be only 5c.  (I am going to keep buying the cards at the store, and not mess around with \"auto renewal\" monthly things at their site, as people here seem to complain about it, though you may save a few dollars doing it online.)Boy---if you even TRY to use the very limited internet on this phone, each attempt, if you get on or not, alerts you that some more minutes were chewed away.  Haven't even been able to check my Yahoo! email.  I click what is apparently the link, after logging on...and it resets back to the original search screen, chewing away minutes.  Sigh.I also chose Net-10 because it SAYS it rides on major carriers, and as such you get the same 10c/min. coverage, including in roaming areas....as opposed to the small print on Trac Phone, which says that if the phone is out of service area, in 'roaming' the phone will not work (!).  Alas, the one place I'd hoped I'd get signal--a building I work in on the weekends, that is notoriously bad for most cell services--it does not work in.  \"Antennae\" and 4 bars showing...but it states \"No Service!\"Largest complaint is the &%^! virtual keyboard. I have NO idea how everyone here is applauding this feature!  I'm a female, and the virtual keys are so small...I have to continually backspace to correct. I'm fussy about spelling, and I'm so tired of correcting my mistypes that I've given up looking after my spelling.  ...I'm finding myself holding it in one hand, and using one index finger only to slowly, carefully tap out a message. ...I'd type a text faster on my old 9-digit phone keypad!  Also, I find the screen not sensitive enough, despite what everyone is saying.  I click on a contact, it is then highlighted so it must have registered...yet I have to keep pounding on it. Ugh.Sound is good on this phone, though. Lots of neato gadgets and widgets you'll quickly find useful, for those like me coming from the dinosaur era of early cell phones, who are not used to such frills.  HOWEVER, what do all the camera/music/widget advantages have, if one is aggravated by the basics? I didn't buy the phone for widgets.Also, I do agree it seems sturdy.  I dropped it about three feet onto a slate slab, and it *seems* okay.  Although, the fact that I dropped it may be due to the small, sleek, slippery shape of it, which I think someone else mentioned.  Ugh--I'm ready to tape duct tape around it, to give it some grip.UPDATE: Looks like it was only with that $20/200 minute card that texts were 5c/min.  ...I now have the $25/750 minute for 30 days card, and texts are 10c/min.UPDATE: It also chews away 2.5 minutes, just for \"retrieving\" messages sent from certain types of technology--smart phones or whatever, I'm not savvy on what--in addition to another 1 minute for opening that same message.Continues to be exceptionally slow in response time, after tapping on virtual keyboard.  Ugh.  Sometimes it doesn't even respond, upon tapping and tapping on your selection.  ALSO, in cold weather its exceptionally bad.Often, upon loading minutes from a top-up card purchased at a store, I get a message of \"system unavailable at this time\" or some such thing. ...It could be several minutes...or several HOURS before I am able to add minutes to my phone!

If you intend to access the internet much like you do with your iPad or Mac, PC etc..  you'll be disapointed.  I believe this phone has the capabilities but I believe more likely the limitation is Tracfone or Net10 not allowing but certain apps to be installed.  Some of this is caused by the phone but it's what your service provide may be limiting you what you access.  I tried to load the Facebook app and it appeared to attempt to download the app indicating that it was trying.  Once I got so far (and  was at all bars at this time) and a message indicated that this service was not available.  This was during several tries over several days.  I just thought maybe that there was a network issue or something.  I've had Tracfone for several years now and went from a very simplified phone to hoping to get an ocassional access to the internet to get directions or information about a particular store.  This phone has a little more than for calling and texting works fine but if you intend to use it for straight internet browser access, you'll be disappointed unless an app will actually load as a couple have but don't count on it for dependable internet access.

This also happens when you use the browser. The games that this phone comes with are very fun! And you can download the facebook app and it's pretty good. The Facebook app is a little faster than the browser. The music player is basic and good. When I first got the phone, I thought the 3.5 mm headphone jack (standard) was too small.

On my LG900 I was only charged 1/4 of a minute or 2.5 cents per minute for a 1 page text.....1/2 of a minute or 5 cents per minute for a 2 page text, etc. On the LG800G, I am being charged DOUBLE. 1/2 of a minute or 5 cents per minute for the first page text..1 whole minute or 10 cents per minute for a 2 page text, etc. and 5 minutes (50 cents) to download a picture versus 2.5 minutes (25 cents) to download a picture on my LG900.On my phone calls, what used to cost me 10 cents per minute, now costs me 20 cents. That would mean a 10 minute phone call is costing me $2.00. Why not stop at a phone booth and make a call. Why didn't you tell us THAT on the OUTSIDE of the box BEFORE I typed in 112 contacts.

Many websites are not available to this phone which limits the amount of stuff that you can do. While app capable the apps that it could use were extremely limited. Also I found that other phones that my friends had, that were also Net 10, picked up much better that this one. It is a very small phone with terrible calibration. Even with a case it isn't very durable. Now for the price, yes it is a good phone. But you will find yourself wanting a new phone within a few months if you are like me. For a person's first phone it's great touch screens are very popular today much more popular then keyboard or normal phones. But in the end you may find yourself wanting your money back.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Net 10 tip", "Author": "R.

You will be calling them back.  After 4 days of calling them back and being on hold for more then an hour on average each day I was told to ask to speak with the android department when I call tomorrow.If your time is not valuable and you don't need your phone to be reliable then net10/track phone may be a good choice for you.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lousy phone, lousy phone service", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R24VYPZM4ENEFB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "How many ways does Net10 fail to please? Let's list them:* You will get dinged for minutes EVERY single time someone texts you, and if they send you pics of their cat (because, that's the kind of thing we all love to pay for) you will probably have as many as four minutes deducted from your account.* This particular phone is borderline disposable. Use it for about three or four months, and if you get that far - you'll be ready to upgrade.* The Net10 website for making online payments is particularly bad. Very slow loading, somewhat confusing, and - just to make things worse though by no means a deal breaker - it looks awful. I've seen better sites administered by ten-year-olds.* Just make the leap and go with another no-contract provider that gives unlimited text / talk for an add'l $10 or $15 per month, because you'll use up the $25 Net10 plan long before your 30 days are up; you'll end up spending more when all is said and done.Steer clear of Net10, there are far better no-contract plans and service providers out there.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst phone ever!!!!", "Author": "Coco", "ReviewID": "R1UC6KGLQMHRC0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for about 2 mos.
