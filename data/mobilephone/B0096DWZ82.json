That of course, does not apply to any of the products that Amazon takes under its wing and sells with Amazon blessings. Some vendors are in fact very concerned about providing their products as advertised, but I have to question why somebody would trust a high risk item such as a used Smartphone being listed here without first shopping around for the same phone that has 4G  LTE, brand new, at a comparable price, and is completely guaranteed. There are better deals to be found so I highly recommend that you check out the availability of this T-Mobile prepaid phone elsewhere, especially if your locale happens to have T-Mobile's 4G services available.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "nat13", "ReviewID": "R231ZF9XHYZJKR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, The phone came before the estimated time of arrival, wonderful!

Instead I received a phone that was in a box that stated there was no warranty and that the phone can be used or refurbished but in operational condition. To return it, one had to call the seller within 15 days to get a return number (otherwise you are stuck with the phone) and of course the seller's phone was constantly busy. I contacted Amazon that stood by me and made sure the seller was contacted and received the returned phone. I purchased a new phone later elsewhere and so I can compare what the seller had sent me to a new phone. The \"new phone\" this seller had sent was not in an original box, had no manual, no earphones, and no warranty. And of course it said it could be refurbished. The positive thing I learned is that Amazon stands by you and will help you sort things through.

Even if you are an experienced user, you'll need it, because there are SO MANY features you can customize.Design is sleek and light. Fits in a purse pocket well. Downside to the design: holding it in one hand, you tend to hit the volume AND the on/off button at the same time (surprise!). You'll learn to hold it so that doesn't happen.I bought the SIM card at Walmart to get the cheap/simple data plan from TMobile. That could have gone better, but if you know what you want, you can get it, eventually. I am weeding out the pre-loaded stuff that I will never use.This phone is loaded with features and I am using more each day:  auto-rotate for sideways display,  auto-brightness for the screen (I live in the very bright desert.),  Bluetooth to the car (it whistles every time they meet),  getting my email online (had to scale that back-too much info, but there's a setting for that, of course),  two cameras (the one facing you turns off the keypad when you actually use it as a phone, so you don't face-dial),  voice input (easier than typing on that necessarily tiny keyboard, plus it makes me look cool).I was worried about paying for features I won't use, but I keep finding things that are useful even as I discard or disable others.
