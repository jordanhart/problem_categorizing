Their were many great phones but the ion had an amazing price. I consider myself a pretty heavy user and so far the phone treated me great. It runs on a snapdragon s3 processor and not s4 but it is still extremely smooth and everything opens up quickly. The build quality is quite good and I like the mix of aluminum and rubber in the back. The display on it is truly amazing and the bravia engine is great. The display really suprised me, it has very strong and relestic colors and overall looks better to me that the s3 and on par with the one x. The camera is also really good. It captures very nice colors and has many great modes and feutures. Now for the downsides. One huge problem is that the phone comes with gingerbread which is actually quite sad. Lucky their is an update to ics out which makes it a lot better and faster. Another is the touch buttons. They are very hard to press and the light is under them and not on them which is very strange. Overall ion is a great price and was worth it for sure. If youre looking for a phone with a great price but is still very good this is the phone for you.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good phone overall, but with its limitation", "Author": "Rambo", "ReviewID": "R1PF10OKJXKYOE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When this cellphone was introduced at last year CES in Las Vegas, reviewers gave it a thumbs up. This was to be Sony's first LTE phone and the first to have the Sony-only brand on it (after the company bought Ericsson's share). At that time, I owned the Xperia X10 that I don't miss. This phone is not too bad but I expected more from it based on the reviews I initially read following Sony's press conference at the show. I received the Xperia Ion from AT&T; in July 2012, a month after the carrier started distributing it in the United States. There is no doubt that the hardware design is pretty nice, better than some of the phones out there. It has a 4.5 inch screen and weights relatively 5 ounces. The phone, in my opinion, has some software issues despite an upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich. In my experience, call quality is not always good as the Cnet initial review stated. I've also experienced quiet a few call drops but that could be due to a congestion with the AT&T; network. The 12.1 megapixels camera can at times be disappointing. The camera features impressive options, however, such as the scene recognition and sweep panorama. Pictures are crystal clear when they are. When they're not, you wonder, \"What the hell is that?\" Video recording is in HD format. Generally speaking, the camera seems to work best during daytime or when there is enough lighting. Other than these flaws, the phone is pretty good actually. A cool feature is the improved Sony-owned Timescape that let you monitor social network feeds in real time (with a wireless connection of course). Internet browsing is easy, especially with the Google Chrome app. For now, I use the phone to listen to music and that hasn't been a good experience, alas. The Music Unlimited service that I use (also owned by Sony) crashes a lot but I'm not sure if the Ion is to blame or if it's due to a faulty, buggy app. If you don't expect too much from owning a smartphone, I would recommend this unit, especially if you already own other Sony products (it marries well into the company's ecosystem). But if you expect a good performance for at least a year, I would go with either another model (the Ion has a few younger sisters and more to come, all supposed to perform better) or with another manufacturer like Apple or Samsung.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "My favorite phone", "Author": "bikerchickk", "ReviewID": "R1P5DEEIIBHQ7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had one of these phones since they first came out. I was working for ATT tech support and so I knew what I wanted. This has a fantastic camera, great video recorder. I am needing a new phone after dropping mine, and after looking at new phones, have decided to get another one of these. Best phone ever! Audible works awesome on here and I have not had any problems with a single app I had downloaded. Has fantastic settings for power save modes which can be changed to your own personal preferences. You can pretty much do that on every setting on the phone. Not many phones are able to be personalized as easily as this one.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid phone", "Author": "Lituus", "ReviewID": "R1NT1J4YKTX0SP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have now had this phone for over two months and I am quite happy with it.  It is much faster and more responsive than my prior HTC smart-phone.  Overall navigation and ease of use is solid/ typical Android.  The camera takes great photos and movies. The music player is also quite good.  The James Bond theme is pretty cool although very understated; I like the James Bond theme song ring-tone.Size for me is very important and the Xperia is a good compromise between large screen and portability.  Most of the other highly-rated, non-Apple smartphones are too big to comfortably carry in a pocket but this has a reasonable size.Overall it is a very solid phone and a good value. I would buy it again.A few cons (all minor in my opinion):- battery life is not great.  I have been getting around 1.5-2 days on a charge.  For a brand new phone I think it should be longer but a full day is my requirement. FYI- I rarely use GPS and mostly use WiFi (text, email, web, apps, etc) with not too much talking/calling.- power button is on the side, in the middle.  This takes some getting used to and I keep hitting volume buttons when I intend to hit the power switch.- preloaded AT&T; apps that you cannot remove are annoying- you can tack on another ~$30 to the expected cost because you will need to purchase an SD card for this phone", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Could have been great.", "Author": "Rebekah K. \"avid reader and technophile\"", "ReviewID": "R3EUB5NV5UPMLZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Yesterday at Best Buy I signed up for AT&T; and although I wanted a Galaxy S3, the camera and display of the Ion caught my eye. So, I got the Ion and right out of the box the battery was beyond dead and I had to wait an extra 45 minutes for it to charge enough to activate it.When I got home, I played with it. I'm a heavy texter, photographer and app user. I liked that this has now comes with Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box. The 12MP camera was pretty good. However, the button for the camera on the lower right side of the phone did not work unless I pressed it and held it for a good 10-15 seconds. It's not a one-click button for opening the camera, as it should be.The buttons along the bottom of the screen are a disaster. The emblems for Menu, Home, Back and Search are there along the bottom, but those are NOT buttons. They do not light up. The actual buttons are thin horizontal lines below the emblems that backlight when tapped. Sort of. I couldn't just tap a button to use it. I had to rub the button area; actually slide my finger up and down a couple times before the button realized I was trying to use it. The Menu button didn't even want to work at all.The display is gorgeous. The screen is a little thinner than I like, but still a good size. The phone is solid with some weight to it. It felt good in my hands.If the buttons worked, I probably would have kept this phone, as it was free. I took it back today and paid for my Galaxy S3. I wanted to love the Ion, but it was far too annoying to operate.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "New phone", "Author": "Vickie", "ReviewID": "R3KG1SCVONT9MK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone for my daughter.

I really regret not getting an updated iPhone. Even my dinky messenger phone was better than this phone. From the moment I opened the box I had problems with it not being able to receive calls or call out and the internet wouldn't work. I took it back and they said I needed to upgrade to jellybean or gingerbread I forget which. I tried to return it but was discouraged and told the upgrade would solve my problem. The browser only works when it wants to and when I call out I have to try like 5 times because it hangs up as soon as it starts ringing on the other persons end. My ringer and message tone only work when they want and pictures won't load on my browser. I really wish I would've put my foot down and returned this phone. I even tried to exchange it and best buy wouldn't let me for some reason. Now I have to wait until November 2014 to upgrade. Awful phone do not get it. I'd give it negative 5 stars of I could.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dumbest Phone Ever -- Dont Buy", "Author": "miaeba", "ReviewID": "R20BD88331V6M7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a&tt.;  This phone was sent to me from insurance to replace an Atrix 2 Moto.
