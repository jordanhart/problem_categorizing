Its a great phone. I ordered it on the 1st of the month and it arrived on the 4th. Battery was charged, and since at&t; compatible, I was off and running.  Now for the con's even though you save everything to your sims card, it DOES NOT transfer to the new phone, but I did go from a Nokia to a Motorola, that may have been the glitch, because my husband has one (a Razr), and we tried his sims card and yep, all his info is now on my phone (all except the photos). Its easy to use, the user guide that's provided is useless, but go to the Motorola site, and download, or read what you need to know, and your golden. So far, no dropped calls, sound quality is good, it is user friendly, not too big, or too small for those of us who tend to misplace things.  Programed ring tones are awful, but that's to be expected. You will loose all your photos from your old phone, unless you know how to transfer them, all in all, a great buy. I don't think you will be disappointed.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "E.

So it was up to me, not my warranty, to replace my phone. All the phones I could have purchased through AT&T;, since it wasn't time to renew my contract, were a lot more expensive than this. This is a cute, very functional phone. The spring which connects the two halves of the phone seems strong and good quality, which is important because that seems to be one of the first things to go on flip phones. Since the phone was unlocked, all I had to do was open the box, power the phone on, and take the sim card from my old phone and stick it in this one and voila! It was ready to use, with my contacts and everything.Also, it is definitely new, not refurbished, and it included a charger.

We will be switching carriers and we do not want to get a replacement phone from AT&T; that might extend the existing contract any longer.  My daughter is VERY hard on cellphones, and I wanted something inexpensive, physically robust, reasonably feature rich, and that would still not be \"embarrassing\" for her to carry around.  When I saw this at the listed price, I could not resist.I have had a Razr myself in the past and I loved it.  This one is the later version, with more features plus video and a camera.  And being available in pink for my daughter was a plus.I was positively surprised when the phone arrived (and quickly I might add).  The product description was not very clear about what was included in the package, so I was relieved that the battery and the plug in charger were included.  This arrived in perfect new packaging, brand new, in perfect condition.The included battery had reasonable charge to it, so we plugged in her SIM card and immediately tested the phone.  It worked perfectly out of the box, and a few weeks later now she remains totally satisfied with this phone.Although it is not an iPhone or similar smart-phone, it meets her needs and requires no specialty or expensive service plan(s).  We do use unlimited text and data anyway, but we are currently under a legacy plan where that is not cost prohibitive.So in summary, although this is not the latest smart-phone capable of apps and the newer really cool (and expensive) stuff, this is a very reliable phone capable of text, data, photos and video.  If you are looking for a phone in this category, you really can not go wrong for the price.Keep in mind that a mini USB cable is required to transfer files (ie photos/videos) from the phone to your computer.  In addition, the required drivers to allow this are NOT included with the phone package, but are generally available on the internet.  I would post a link, but I am unsure if posting URLs in reviews is acceptable.  Nonetheless, it is easy to find by searching Google.  Further, \"Motorola Phone Tools\" software can be easily found on Amazon, at very inexpensive prices, and some offerings include the cable.I will update this review should our longer term experiences vary, however thus far we are VERY happy with this product, its features, and accessories included.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great basic phone", "Author": "Caroline Saddul", "ReviewID": "R2LD6PM3VIP709", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "All i wanted was a phone I could use for calls and texting and the Razr is perfect for that.

This seemed like a good solution.  First of all, the phone I got was not the U.S. version, as advertised - the big clue was the \"personalise\" option in the menu.  The phone works as a phone and actually has better reception in my concrete walled apartment than my old Nokia.  It also works for sending texts as well as any other basic phone with a numeric keypad.  I have no interest in spending a lot of time surfing the net on my phone, but it's nice to be able to access the net from a phone to download games, ringtones, etc.  I can not access the net from this phone.  It has menu options to get there, but when I push the button, I get an error message.  Also, even though the phone has a camera, I have yet to be able to view any pictures sent to me from other phones.  I never had problems like this with any of the Nokia phones I got directly from AT&T...I;'m really not sure if it's the phone itself that's the problem or if something went wrong in unlocking it or if there is incompatibility because of it being European.Also, the company sent the wrong charger with the phone and I had to buy my own charger.
