Screen size and resolution (pixel density) are great. Much better than the old iPhone. And everything is flexible and unlocked. This is a real unleashed Android device.Not depending on ANY operator is the best thing. I have 2 GB of music and there is still plenty of space in my phone.

I don't care anymore.
