I dropped it a bunch of times and it kept working just fine. Battery life is great. Good call quality. The case is solid: metallic and feels good (unlike cheap plastic style in some other phones). One of a few flip smartphones on the market.Bad: (internal) power connector breaks overtime (had to be replaced twice). I also had to change the back cover of the case with time as it started sliding (but again, I did drop it a lot and generally sloppy user so..)It's outdated by now but so is the price. If one needs a cheap windows smartphone, this one is definitely a good option.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "avoid this one", "Author": "PAO", "ReviewID": "R2TE46UOQEYWB5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wanted to upgrade my old battle worn Motorola that runs the windows operating system with a 'newer' technoloy(only 2 years old)so i picked this phone which runs a newer version on the operating system, etc. the good is that the phone has a nice display and feel to it. the bad is that it would not work as well and allow much ability to confiure it with Activesync...example-it downloaded all 400 of my contats from outlook and would not allow me to filter what went on the phone..old phone did this. same for tasks. the signal would barely 'lock on' in my house, the old phone does much better. the driver in the phone is older than what is availabe from HTC but since it's an IMATE device they will not download new software to this phone. IMATE support is @#$#@. even after escalating to 'engineering' they claimed they made the phone(rather than rebranding it). i think you get the picture. Upgrades to the phone are available if phone is the Cingular version, which MAY solve the problems i had. i returned the phone and got the usual great Amazon support.", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Dead phone", "Author": "Wishing for Honesty", "ReviewID": "ROXAIQY8SCVF4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "New? It worked 2 days and died. 2 hours transferring data and tweaking the phone, now it dies and I can't even delete my personal info and I get the PRIVILEGE of paying for shipping broken garbage to me and back - That is if they will accept it since the original box got trashed. I think I will accept I got shafted for $55.00 and not spend another minute or dollar wasted with these thieves and file a complaint with paypal. Yea let me send back the phone with my data do I can then spend 20 hours cancelling my credit cards and BS.This is a damn windows SMART phone - NOT A FREAKING TOASTER!!!!!!!!!I am the idiot for trusting this BS, but not stupid enough to send my data on this phone to these thieves.Thanks Amazon - I'l get right on buying from you guys again . . . . . in my next life.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
