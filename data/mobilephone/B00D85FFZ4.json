I spent forever comparing specs and found this to be superior to apple and other androids. For American consumers like me At&t; has the needed micro Sims it was painless to setup. Just pop it in verify the number and copy (setup the same - i don't mean moving files) the AP configuration the same as other android tablets \"att broad band ... etc\" As much as the specs made sense seeing is definitely believing.  The Sony modifications to the base system including Walkman and FM Radio among other things are awesome. It is stunningly good looking. And takes great pictures and video.... I was concerned about not having a flash but it turned out not to be a big deal, low light level still took nice pictures. I have no complaints and highly recommend this tablet", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet.

But disappointed. There is an issue with the 4G/LTE connectivity in these Sony Xperia tablets. I took it to AT&T;, they tried connectivity with 2 SIM cards. Sony tech support tried some software updates, AT&T; Tech support did some testing but nothing fixed the issue. I placed the order for during black friday sale from the Sony Store and I was surprised to hear from Sony that they will not replace the tablet, but they would refund my purchase and I would have to purchase a new one at current prices.I just saw an update from another customer who bought it in November 2013 who seemed to have the same issue. I wish I had read the review before placing my order.Raj", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Android Tablet I Have Tried", "Author": "Mike L.", "ReviewID": "RROWD9OCE5J5K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have purchased several Android tablets over the past few years.  The Sony tablet is by far, my favorite.  While the screen resolution isn't quite as good as the Nexus 10, the difference is minimal.  My Galaxy Note 10.1 & 8.0 can't hold a candle to the screen of the Sony.  The SD card expandability and 4G LTE radio were final deciding factors for me.  I'm an AT&T; customer and the SIM card popped in and started working with no issues.  The unit is very comfortable to hold for long periods of time because of it's minimal weight.  Batter life is quite good.  If you engage the Stamina Mode, the unit will last for days on a single charge.  The only minor criticism is about the hardness of the screen material.  I don't know what material Sony is using, but I've managed to put a few small scratches on the panel in a short amount of time.  My iPad and other tablets have gone much longer with hardly any signs of wear at all.  I don't like using screen protectors, but I may with the Sony.  I highly recommend the Tablet Z.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.99", "Features": "Tablet with no support for GSM voice communication. 2G Network\tGSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 3G Network\tHSDPA 850 / 900 / 2100  \tLTE 800 / 850 / 900 / 1800 / 2100 / 2600 SIM\tMicro-SIM\nDISPLAY\tType\tLED-backlit LCD, capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors Size\t1200 x 1920 pixels, 10.1 inches (~224 ppi pixel density) Multitouch\tYes, up to 10 fingers Protection\tShatter proof and scratch-resistant glass  \t- Sony Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2\nCAMERA\tPrimary\t8.1 MP, 3264x2448 pixels, autofocus, check quality Features\tGeo-tagging, touch focus, face and smile detection, HDR Video\tYes, 1080p@30fps, HDR, check quality Secondary\tYes, 2.2 MP, 1080p@30fps\nOS\tAndroid OS, v4.1.2 (Jelly Bean), planned upgrade to v4.2 (Jelly Bean) Chipset\tQualcomm Snapdragon APQ8064 CPU\tQuad-core 1.5 GHz Krait GPU\tAdreno 320\nSpeed\tHSDPA, 42 Mbps; HSUPA, 5.8 Mbps; LTE, Cat3, 50 Mbps UL, 100 Mbps DL WLAN\tWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band, DLNA, Wi-Fi hotspot Bluetooth\tYes, v4.0 with A2DP NFC\tYes Infrared port\tYes USB\tYes, microUSB v2.0 (MHL)", "Name": "Sony Xperia Tablet Z White 3g/4g (Factory Unlocked) 10.1\" Hd , 1.5 Ghz Quad Core Ship Worldwide", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41duwWtWO4L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00D85FFZ4"}}
