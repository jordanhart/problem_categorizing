And I don't even know to which carrier it's locked to. I contacted them and they would simply deny the fact, or ask me to contact Samsung about it. Samsung asked me to contact my carrier, but the point is that the phone is not locked to my carrier. The point is, the phone asks for the \"SIM network unlock PIN\" when it turns on, and won't accept a SIM card from my carrier without this magic code.I'm left with an expensive touchscreen MP3 player.The smartphone itself is a great, if not the best, budget option for an Android device.It only lacks a real camera. 3.1MP and no flash makes it a toy camera. But if you won't be using your cell as your main camera, this is pretty good indeed.A point worthy noting is that the GPS will not work outside North America without applying some hacks. Fortunately, the are some apps on the Android Market that will the GPS optimization for you. I haven't tried them though.As a pro, I loved the contacts synchronization with Google Contacts (you GMail contacts), Facebook and Twitter. It will download all your contacts from these accounts and merge them when the names coincide. You're given the option to hide the contacts that lack a mobile phone (like will be the case for most of your GMail contacts). The Facebook synchronization saved me the effort of setting a picture of every one of my contacts: It will use the current Facebook profile photo.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good cheap smartphone with Android", "Author": "Dmitry Lysenko", "ReviewID": "R23N2DH5R2LA3D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pro:  Android 2.1.

It's way better than what i expected and its just awesome.the delivery was fast and the phone itself is just so smart and so comfortable. its actually better than galaxy s in the size and the shape because galaxy s looks like a square and similar to the iphone. But galaxy 3 looks like samsung, and there is no phone that can be compared to this..i read a lot of reviews about this phone but some of them were wrong because the battery is lasting so long that i am really surprised. its lasting 2 days with heavy texting, calling, internet browsing but battery is more than half full. also the back light is really bright you can see with bright sunshine. the touch screen is so smooth and its just similar to galaxy s.i really recommand this phone to people who are looking for a smart new phone. its also adroid with youtube, internet, navigation, and smart search, and many other useful programs with wifi so go for it.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Troubles with the lock code", "Author": "jldoria", "ReviewID": "R344YBB3IZCJJI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "On december 17 2010.

I could never get the computer to communicate with it, not even with the latest software updates.  The operating system is way too slow, it cant even handle the calendar application which comes with the phone.  It crashes more than a windows vista computer! Dont even try running things like facebook or angry birds (slow birds rather). I doubt the internal memory for applications reaches even 200MB (yes, MB), but since the phone wont tell you, i guess ill never find out before i finally sell this coaster.  I just can download very many of them before it fills up and of course, you cant store them in the microsd card.  Ive been able to find no covers, no dust jackets, no accessories AT ALL for this phone, and Samsumg customer service is not even worth mentioning.  Would rate it 0 if possible.
