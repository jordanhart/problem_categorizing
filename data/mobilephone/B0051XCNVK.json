{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good, entry-level phone that is gimped by low storage", "Author": "Benjamin K. Gifford", "ReviewID": "R1K5T1G1JP3CHQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using this phone for a few weeks and have been fairly pleased. It definitely has a bit of a \"wow\" factor based on its small size, nicely contoured shape, and somewhat unique color. It is generally responsive and makes calls well. The battery life is on the very high end compared to other Android phones I've used.Don't expect to be gaming a lot because the processor is fairly slow. Cut the Rope runs okay, but there is occasional slow down.Also, Netflix playback is choppy to the point of being unwatchable. However, video from Youtube plays just fine.It comes with HTC Sense, so take that for what you will. Personally, I like it because it is pleasing to the eye and makes some tasks very simple.This phone has one GLARING problem, and that's the internal storage. The phone has 512mb of storage build in, which sounds like plenty. However, the Android OS, Sense, Sense updates, and pre-installed apps (though there aren't too many) only leave the user with 30-40 megs of free space. Also, if the phone gets to around 10-12 megs free, it will stop syncing Google accounts, which limits the user to really only 20-30 usable megs. Many apps can be moved to the SD card, but not all of them. Keep in mind that you may have to strip down to the bare essentials.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not international version", "Author": "Tulia Cortes \"Tulipan\"", "ReviewID": "R1MGIM5KTKLH6X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THIS ITEM IS A CDMA, ONLY TO USE WITH VIRGIN MOBILE CARRIER, DON'T BUY IT IF YOU ARE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY BECAUSE IT WON'T WORK....", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pitiful battery life and internal memory", "Author": "Brian520", "ReviewID": "R38OEZE6GGIRTH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Only came with 150MB usable internal memory.

Even if it did, what good is it if you have to restart it after every phone call?Maybe it's a cheap, small smartphone, but pitifully small internal memory, and terrible battery life makes it a pain to use.

It was just the right size to slip into my pocket, though bulky once I got the rubber case for it (it's slippery otherwise). But even for someone like me who appreciates the smaller phones, I know a crappy phone when I see one.Oh how I hate this phone. Despite the fact that it's survived a drop in water, been thrown to the floor by my toddler countless times, thrown against the wall in anger, and is still going after two years is actually pretty impressive. But don't let it's durability get to you. It's the most frustrating phone I've ever owned. Let me make a list of all the things wrong about this phone.-First and foremost, is the memory, or should I say LACK of memory? This was the first phone I ever owned that actually had apps on it. And yet I could never hold more than two or three on this phone. The internal memory is so awful that I have to delete updates from running software that I don't use but can't be deleted just to get some memory in order to get into my pictures to delete them so I can get MORE memory. I have NO apps on this phone. I only use it for internet (which can't be accessed if the memory gets too low, in which I have to clear more space),  pictures (which starts to be too much for the memory at about 72 pics) and talking and texting. Bottom line, the memory SUCKS. If you want a smaller, older phone but want apps, DON'T get this.-Battery. This phone has gone through two chargers, and after two years will no longer charge all the way anymore. My battery is almost dead by evening. I usually always have to plug it into its charger at least once a day after it's charged all night. It's horrible.-Texting. I'm used to texting fast, but this phone doesn't seem to be able to be at the same pace as me. I use the predict text because I'm so used to it, and if I didn't, I'd be texting twice as long because the letters are too small and I end up hitting another letter next to the one I meant to hit, so I use predict text. If you text too fast it'll gives some pretty strange words, such as \"dAOding\" and random crap like that. The predict text needs to take some english classes, it doesn't know the proper usage for sentences. Ex: using \"were\" when I'm trying to say \"we're\" and vice versa. Texting on this phone will give you a headache, and will easily turn your 1 minute of texting into a 5 minute anger fest as you try to text the right thing.-Camera. The camera was good when I first got the phone, but wear has no doubt made it fuzzy, foggy, washed out, etc. It takes decent pics but if you're looking to capture some heartfelt moments with friends or family, don't use the camera.-Cases, or lack of. I had three other family members who owned this phone when it came out, and none of us could ever find a case for it, because there basically weren't any. A couple of cellular places in the mall had some, in a box under the counter. I had a choice between three cases and went with the ugly black rubber one because it was the only one that would protect my phone. And, well, the case actually has served its purpose, and because of the rubber case it's actually expanded the life of this phone. So if you do, for whatever reason, get this phone, don't count on finding a decent case for it.-I don't know about others, but this phone will randomly go white and the HTC logo will come up, as if it's just crashed. Phone has to be restarted regularly to function better.Overall, this phone just isn't worth it. If you don't care for apps, if you'd rather just browse internet and take a few pics now and then, then you might want this phone. But if you're an avid internet surfer, you may want to look elsewhere. The horrible memory and battery life will have you thrashing this phone against the wall before you know it.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "exactly what I expected.", "Author": "Jose Antonio Arcoverde", "ReviewID": "R2GB7OFWT2FVQA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this item for my sun in Brazil.
