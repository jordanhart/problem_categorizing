{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Does not seem to meet all the specifications listed for the phone", "Author": "rioreynolds", "ReviewID": "R1TXUQUEJOE8XI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone a couple of weeks ago.It seems to work fine in the US and was easy to activate at an AT&T; store. (I am waiting to activate it in Brazil, since that is were I will use it over the next couple of years.)My one complaint is that the phone says its external memory can be expanded to 16GB. I have purchased two different Micro SD cards of 8 and 16 GB's and neither one is able to be read by the phone. Only my third purchase of 2GB card seems to work.The seller, MobileCity, says it works for up to 16GB, but looking at the international sites for LG, they say the phone only works for up to 4GB.You may want to check this out before purchasing or especially before buying memory for the phone.Other than that, it has worked fairly well for a basic touch screen phone with a few other additional features.Also, remember, this is an international phone (made for the Thai market) so getting help and information may not be easy in certain countries or regions.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "great for the money", "Author": "ernestopapa", "ReviewID": "R2XC69BI8GC41", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is great for for the money. all the features are excellent. it takes a 4GB microSD card. will recommend to anyone.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005760AFM"}}
