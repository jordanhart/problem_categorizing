It has very good and decent hardware and software (there is no app drawer which isn't such a downer  but if it bothers you that there isn't any,  a simple launcher download will do. ) Really good screen real estate,  snappy UI and a pretty good camera, not Lumia-esque but good enough. Despite what it says you can use 64gb SD card in it. 2gb  ram,  it may say one but I'm sure if there are 1 and 2 gb models.  Otherwise it's a very good phone and yes... the charge does last for a long time.  I'll update as to how long and what apps take up battery.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice when it works", "Author": "deborah L. thompson", "ReviewID": "R1RU51NSUENXV9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for 2 weeks without any issues, then  it stopped reading my sim card.

I've done some research from the Chinese site thinking that this is a dual sim phone. Knowing possible issues with returning I choose to get it from Amazon. What a good bet that was, Phone arrived, found out that it is Single Sim Phone, AND, the phone came isn't the 2 gig Ram version but the Australia Version with only 1 gig Ram with NFC which I don't need.I tried the phone one night and decided to turn it back since I need a dual sim phone , period. This is a perfect phone to me and I did compare it to the Note II, I think color is more true and real life than the Samsung Product (even the S4) and par to Apple's Ipad or Iphone 5. You can get a screen that's bright and blue or you can get a screen that's just right. ATT and Tmobile is flat out stupid not to carry this phone. Easily win lots of love if people only have to pay 10 dollars per month for 2 years contract agreement with this phone.Now back to the DUAL SIM User, get the BLU Life VIEW !!! It is 5.7 dual sim that support T Mobile's reframed 1900 band !!! HSPA 42+ is just as fast as LTE !!! Stop getting played from the carriers !", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Chinese System", "Author": "Crisologo Silva Cuellar", "ReviewID": "R2WRXWMWOA4XQF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ve received this last phone (Ive bough another one befores with no problems at all ) ,  that comes with a Huawei System that has the usual restrictions in China.
