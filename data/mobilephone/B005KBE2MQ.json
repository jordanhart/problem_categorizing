{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice little phone but not waterproof.", "Author": "Barry", "ReviewID": "R1ALMN47PW5PV4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture showing the phone submerged in water is very misleading.  The phone has some protections from water but it is clearly not intended to be submerged. If you got caught in a heavy rain it would probably be alright but if you forgot it in you pocket and dove in a pool, it does not look like it would survive.  Without ruining it I have no way to test its waterproofness but looking at it, it does not appear to be that well sealed. I have a waterproof MP3 player that clearly is intended to swim with, this phone can't do that.  Since I bought it intending to leave in my pocket when I went into the water, I am very disappointed.Otherwise, it is a nice little phone.  Screen is bright, colorful  and easy to read. Lots of features. MP3 play back works well.  Does not receive wifi.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice phone", "Author": "Susan Nicholas", "ReviewID": "R3FUXZTN5E72QE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "good cell phone for somebody looking for a phone to make calls and to listen music. but sometimes it give me a headache trying to to get the features", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "GSM Quad Band 850/900/1800/1900 MHz, Unlocked\nDual SIM Card Support with Dual SIM Standby (Both SIMs)\nWaterproof, Dustproof, Shock-resistant; Comfortable Slim Design\nSupport WAP/GPRS/SMS Messaging; Bluetooth 2.0;\nLithum Ion Battery 800mAh,with long Standby time 72 hours and Talk Time 480 Minutes", "Name": "SVP\u00ae IPro Magic QuadBand, Dual SIM, Water Proof Mobile Phone (Unlocked)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41o1zQJHKlL.jpg", "ProductID": "B005KBE2MQ"}}
