{"Reviews": [{"Title": "awesome phone, but dont buy it on amazon since its cheaper somewhere else.", "Author": "sokae", "ReviewID": "R3CWV5HTGNDBB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "#### if you want to buy this phone than buy it from here, ---[...]--- its much cheaper and offer accessories for it for couple more bucks##### performance-  this phone is really snappy fast! Not surprising since it sport an Mt6592 Octa core 1.7ghz with 2GB ram. It run on android JB 4.2 and I find it run really smooth on daily basis.#gaming- this phone run pretty much all games on the PlayStore with ease. The only game it have problems running( little lag here and there) is NFS most wanted and N.O.V.A 3 which other high ends phone also have problem too.# display- the display is really sharp. Its nice, bright and color saturation are pretty much good. The viewing angle is also good and the screen is corning gorilla glass.# battery- I was surprised how good the battery is when its only 2400mah on a 5.5 inch display. I thought it wouldn't last me the whole day but it did and I was using it moderately.....think its cause of the mt6592 octa core since it has a saver core.#speaker- this is probably the drawback of this phone. The speaker are not that loud and call aren't also. Its probably the hardware fault/filmware but I thinks its just mine since most people have no problems with it.# connectively- the edge on this phone is pretty fast on T-Mobile and no, this phone only support 2G and edge not 3g nor 4G lte. On at&t;, you get 3g.#overall, this phone is excellent for the values of the price. Totally recommend if your looking for budget phone with high end specs!", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Zopo zp998", "Author": "pghuni", "ReviewID": "R2U4MLISNSSX2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best phone I ever had.
