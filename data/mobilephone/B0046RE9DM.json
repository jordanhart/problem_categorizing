Sanchez Ajun", "ReviewID": "R1204G1CY61V11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone as a gift for my teenage daughter, she loves the phone...Initially, she was upset at me as I didn't ask her about her thoughts on what kind of phone she would prefer, so I thought I could use this phone if she didn't like it, well, after playing a bit with it, she got in love with this nice piece of technology...She is used to texting via traditional keypad, so she loves the idea of navigating through menus and options via the touchscreen while keeping the phone keypad for dialing and texting functions. Quality of the phone is great (my daughter has tons of pics she can keep in a large memory microSD card, so this is a plus too), the phone feels very resistant and the silver version is very elegant, fits perfectly into small pockets. You'll need to adjust touch screen sensitivity to your preferrences, but the phone has a good feature for completing this task easily. 3G and Wifi capabilities works great in my country, and even when my daugthers' sim card is from 2G technology, the phone has extraordinary reception at areas where her previous 2-3 Nokia phones (various Music express models) never had signal. Quality of pictures are awesome (have not used the flash at this time, but we'll see...). Overall, I highly recommend this phone for someone who needs good battery performance, nice quality pictures, all good stuff such as music, videos, etc., good signal reception and also wanting to keep keypad control for dialing/ texting while improving menu navigation through touch screen...Great product!", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "No support for US customers!", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R17YHQBK8MJZLQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATE!  I had one of the first reviews for this phone, (maybe the first?) on Amazon and I can no longer recommend this phone for US customers.  No US GSM carrier has sold this phone so Nokia has apparently decided it is not worth supporting in the US.  They have some way of identifying the hardware and the new firmware is not available or downloadable through their software application.  They have not only added features but according to release notes they have added bug fixes.  Great, now I know I have a phone with software bugs that will never be fixed.  My phone is also dropping calls indoors where I have never had problems with previous phones.  I wonder if that is one of the bug fixes.I tried to open a ticket with Nokia customer support, this was my response from May 3rd.Thank you for contacting Nokia.You will be receiving a reply from one of our Customer Care Representatives at the earliest.Have a good day.It's June 9th, haven't heard a thing.  Nice way to treat your customers.I had to replace the phone on my ATT plan ( Nokia Mural ) because the battery life was horrible, it dropped calls, would not receive calls and the menu navigation was awful.I am not interested in a smart phone.  My top priorities are battery life, call quality and ease of use.  I could also care less about a camera in a phone.  I also carry my phone in my pocket so the size and shape of this phone is important.  For the 2 weeks I have owned this phone it has met all of these criteria.  I went 3 days before the first charge and that was after playing with all the phones features like WLAN, bluetooth camera and media player and I still had battery left. The call quality is superb, people talking to me on the other end have also noticed the difference, no dropped callls so far.  The ring volume is EXCELLENT!  The main screen and goto menus are totally customizable so if you don't find this phone easy to use it is your own fault.  The resistive touch makes navigation easy.  The screen is also very clear and the picture quality is excellent. Texting uses the traditional key pad and utilizes the touch feature for special charachters.  This phone is thin and the back is rounded so it carries well in my pocket, sometimes I forget it is there.Now for the extra features.  The camera takes pretty awful pictures but I find that true with most phones.  Flash photography on this thing produces incredibly washed out colors.  I the WLAN feature is great!, the default browser is very poor but it also comes with Opera Mini web browser pre-installed and that works surprisingly well.  This does not surf the web as well as a \"smart\" phone but it is certainly tolerable.  One of my favorite features is the * button can be held down for 3 seconds to turn on the camera flash for a flashlight.  Love it!  So far the software support from Nokia is poor because the phone is so new.  There is no ActiveSync which I think is true for most phone. SUPL location, which uses tower triangulation to find your location, is available but I have not found an app that it works with yet.  The java google maps does not support the touch screen.  It comes with a built in mail app which support gmail.  The is no plugin yet for Apple iSync.  Hopefully there will be better software choices the longer this phone is out.  The music player is relatively good, decent sound and a regular sized headphone jack is awesome.  I also appreciate the ability to charge with both the Nokia barrel charger and micro usb.I own an ipod touch which senses electrical conductivity, this phone differs in that it uses resistive touch which senses pressure.  It is not as sensitive but has the advantage of not exposing a glass surface ( possibly more durable ) and you could still use it with gloves on.  Once you get use to using the touch on this phone it goes smooth.  It seems to work best with your thumb.I would recommend this phone to anyone who likes to use their phone as a phone.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone", "Author": "fainan01", "ReviewID": "R3QJD4KVAD5KAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is one of the best innovations by Nokia. It combines both a touchscreen factor and a keypad design that users can make use of. The large keypad really helps for typing and the interface, as usual, is very user friendly.There are somethings you have to be careful for... For instance, when you're sending a text message, if you accidentally touch the screen, you may hit the \"cancel\" button and your text will not go through.I wish the text message interface woud be a little bit better. It just takes time to get to a text message especially if it's a recent one in my opinion. For some users it may not be a problem at all.Also, this phone's vibration is a little light. You may not feel it vibrating for a call sometimes if you're walking or doing physical work.Other than that, it's a really nice, SUPER slim stainless steel phone. the camera is very good. it has a flashlight. the dialpad is really large for your fingers.Surely, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages & that's why I still use mine", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone if you know what you want", "Author": "Marinescu", "ReviewID": "R3FTBRMLRCJ659", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "'Bought this phone about a month ago, I think it's fantastic.

This phone was described somewhere as a hybrid, and I have found that this is a very good description.  I really didn't want a smart-phone, but this gives me the best of both worlds.  Battery life is great, it's an attractive phone, and I can go on the internet if I want to.  AT&T; doesn't consider it a smart-phone, so I am trying out an unlimited internet access plan for $10 per month.  If I want, I can drop that plan and get free wi-fi access where available.  The free Ovi mail account is good for folks like me who don't want to \"text\" but who occasionally like to communicate via email on the go.  I did have some trouble hooking up to the internet initially, but thankfully there are folks out there (on the web) who have left great trails of useful tips--and so I programmed myself onto the AT&T; links.  I highly recommend this phone.May 1 update:  I'm still enjoying this phone, but buyer beware:  I have noticed that this phone \"jumps around\" without my hitting any keys.  I'm not sure why, but just be very aware that you have actually \"locked\" your phone, and are back at the main screen when you're done using any application.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "First unit didn't worked. Returned it and bought another!! Nice!", "Author": "RazzTek", "ReviewID": "RZS2SMUBN7AY2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just received the C3-01 from Amazon.com today and out of the box just put in the battery and plugged it in. The phone started flashing with a white screen. I put my AT&T; SIM in to see if that would make a difference and it didn't. Once again the same white screen and keypad flashing. So I said before I give up on this, let me call Nokia USA for help. The tech said to redo the things that I had already tried and got the same result. I just resent it back to amazon.com for a refund. A brand new phone not working. I would not recommend this phone. I liked the overall feel of the phone but the software has flaws. The Nokia program/ Windows XP/7 were not even able to recognize this device once plugged into the computer.Update: After returning the dud phone back I wanted to give this phone another chance. I bought another unit a day later. This phone works brilliantly with AT&T; and shows 3.5G. The wi-fi works well with the ovi browser that has to be downloaded. The screen may be small for some people but as a unlocked phone with wi-fi, can't beat the features. The phone quality was excellent and the speaker phone is fairly loud. The scrolling aspect is a bit difficult and will take time to get use to. Having and iPhone and a HTC Freestyle on the family plan allows for a unique perspective. This phone is similar in feel to the HTC Freestyle except for the wi-fi aspect. The scrolling aspect as well as the multiple home screens is lacking. Ringtones are not pre-loaded onto the phone.Bottom line: Its a great general phone with some features that can enhance the experience of a phone without having to pay data charges. I would recommend this phone as a secondary phone but those who need the internet with greater response and functionality will want to look for something else.

I like the 6300 keypad a bit better (better tactile feel) but this works pretty okay. The touch screen is alright although scrolling up and down isn't as pleasant as I hoped it would be (I use the iPod touch as the defining standard here).A bit disappointed with the messaging interface. It offers conversation and normal view, but I would prefer if they led me reduce the font size cos it's quite large and the screen isn't very big. I could definitely make do with a smaller font. Also, trying to delete messages one by one is a bit of a pain. I can't find a feature that lets me select multiple messages to delete at one go.Nonetheless, a good offering from Nokia, especially for people who like their phones plain and simple.

I would absolutely not recommend that, unless you can guarantee that it always stays screen up. Unlike my old Nokia 6133( which I dropped 5 times from a bicycle at 20 plus miles per hour with minimal damage), C3-01 is absolutelyNOT designed to be dropped, in spite of the metal casing . The combination of a large screen which is not recessed like on 6133 and candy bar design calls for problems, as a matter of fact you can easily scratch the screen by pushing it over a hard surface.I had to spend additional 13 $ for a Clarivue screen protector.Side buttons : Good and easy to use. I miss a flash light button, which has to be switched from the key board.The slots do not have covers ( even my cheap back up Samsung has it !) and I predict problems down the road with grease and dirt, especially with the USB slot.Battery , SIM card, Memory card and it's installation : The back cover is very difficult to get off. The optional memory card ids in the battery/SIM card compartment. The battery life is somewhat disappointing for a GSM phone, the same as it was with 6133 . I would prefer functional to sleek.The charger and- with full discharge- the p0hone get rather hot during charging. Wonder what it does to the circuitry .Setting up the phone : Not too difficult, but somewhat more so than it was with 6133. There are no menu prompts when you hesitate.The touch screen. A slightly above average size compared to other phones is the good thing.The touch function itself is horrible, difficult to use no matter how long you calibrate. Scrolling is a disaster. I need 3-4 attempts to let it stop where I need it. You try to do it slower and you open applications you do not want to. My 6133 was perfect for one hand use, with some memorizing you could use the phone while driving without looking at it. C3-01 touch and type you better use it in a quiet parking lot with both hands. At this pointy of time I seriously considered returning the phone.Customizing and menu options: Nokia apparently forgot that there are people who simply prefer a white screen without any junk on it. There is one oddity on the menu screen. The call log icon was replaced by music icon and call log has to be accessed through contacts To make things worse, you cannot create a short cut to call log, only to a specific option(e.g. missed calls or voice call duration).Even more bizarre, once there you cannot get to the general call log. Somebody really slept here.There are some unnecessary restrictions for customizing the home screen. But all together, it is still a Nokia and the menus are intuitive and logical, though somewhat less than on my old 6133.One nice thing is that the unit converter is back, although I would prefer more units, e.g. for pressure.Keypad and dialing : Easy to use.Speakerphone : GoodAudio Incoming : Good, but less loud than 6133 even in maximum position. In noisy environment I loose calls.Annoying.Audio outgoing : According to other people good, but less so in a noisy environment. than my old 6133. With a tiny candy bar phone the distance between the mouth and microphone is too large.Ringer : Average, unfortunately less than my old 6133. Lets me miss calls in a noisy environment.Signal sensitivity : Good, but you have to make sure that you do not touch the bottom part of the phone where the antenna is located, which makes holding the phone a bit tricky .Camera : Really good for a cell phone. The zoomed in pictures somewhat less so. This made it a keeper for me after the screen disappointment.Music functions : Work well, I could not care less.International dialing with an alternative carrier : works well with this phone.Bluetooth and data transfer. : Works well with other Nokia phones or your computer ( via USB if the computer has no Bluetooth capability. I could transfer most of my data easily from my 6133 to C3-01.Wireless broadband : C3-01 works on HSDPA networks, in the US only T- mobile has that. I am a T-mobile subscriber but without a data plan so I could not test it. However, I tested the Wi-Fi. Works well, however it is only suitable for an occasional user, for daily use you need a true smart phone.Flash light : I love this improvement, though I miss a dedicated button.I would recommend this phone because there are no really good choices in this segment of the market- the half way between cheap phones and ' smart\" phones- but I think that Nokia missed some opportunities here.:On edit: I am upgrading the rating to 4 stars, however I stick to the comments made.On edit : 2014-04-04The touch screen, which is definitely the weakest part of this phone, gave up on me completely.

But for all I know, the phone may be similarly stubborn about working with other U.S. carriers given that it's a Euro-centric device made by a Euro-centric company. Therefore, I have to recommend that American customers stay away from this phone: despite its nifty feature set, there's just too much risk of things going wrong, and unless you're a mobile techie, it's a major headache trying to fix the bugs (assuming they even can be fixed).First and foremost, TMob doesn't have proper configuration settings for this phone; instead, they sent me settings for a \"similar\" phone, and when problems started to crop up, they told me those were the only settings available.Although I'm still sorting some of these problems out (and may eventually fix most or all of them), it's been a major hassle so far, and one not hinted at in the many professional and amateur reviews I read before buying this model, most of which were very positive about its features and realistic about its limitations. So the sheer out-of-the-box user-unfriendliness really knocks this phone down several notches.The most annoying problems have to do with connectivity and how the phone communicates with online vendors. First, TMob's settings make connecting via wifi (vs. TMob's paid data plans, which I don't participate in) a hassle: before I added their settings, wi-fi worked very well with my home network, but after adding the settings, wi-fi was automatically disabled whenever I tried to get online. I assume this would happen with other carriers besides TMob, given their interest in forcing you into paid plans. After much detective work, I finally figured out how to partly bypass that problem and access wi-fi, though the solution is by no means intuitive and is not a cure-all (e.g., if you click on a URL in a txt message from, say, a ringtone or game vendor, the phone will default to TMobile's Edge or whatever server and not even give you the option of switching to wi-fi, forcing you to use end-arounds that involve manually typing the URL you were sent into a browser, ugh). So call this a mere partial fix at best.Second, if you want to order a game from TMobile's store, you're out of luck b/c the settings won't allow you to download any of their games; TMob told me there's no way around that problem, so all the games I used on my previous phone are now unusable on the Nokia, and I can't buy new games either. And if you try to order a game from somewhere else, you'll likely run into another problem that I still haven't solved: when you try to download the game after buying it, the store's webpage will tell you that [DRUM ROLL] your phone ISN'T A NOKIA C3-01!Again, TMobile is to blame for much of this, and I may eventually find fixes for these and the other problems that have arisen. But then again, new problems are just as likely to pop up given the phone's track record so far, and other carriers may have similar issues with this model, so it's a definite thumbs-down. Who cares about nice cameras and touch screens if you're too busy swatting at system bugs to enjoy them?I may update this review if things improve and new solutions arise, but then again, none of that would change the fact that the phone is in some ways unusable at first, so I doubt I would change my recommendation.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Low budget sensible product", "Author": "Kunal", "ReviewID": "R39FLS6HF258AT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The product is a hybrid version of phone with 3G and touch and type is cool.

Like the 6300, the C3-01 has a stainless steel body and is very sleek. I'm not a big fan of smart phones yet, I use my phone for messaging and making calls...everything else I do on my laptop. So, after reading all the reviews for the C3-01, I went ahead and purchased it. When I received it, I loved the look and feel of the phone, typical Nokia craftmanship. I first turned the phone on without putting my SIM card in just to get a feel for it and really loved the touch screen interface. Then the troubles began. I put my SIM card in, turned the phone back on, and then the phone just started randomly flashing on and off again. The settings I had originally inputed were all reset (time, date, etc.). During a longer break between flashes, I re-inputed the data, only to have the phone flash off again and loose the data once again. I then turned off the phone, took out the battery, the SIM, and re-inserted everything and then turned the phone back on...I ended up doing this several times. Once turned on, the phone continued to do the same thing, just flash on and off again before finally shutting down completely. I began to think there was a problem with the compatibility of the new phone with AT&T;'s network, however, referring back to the phone's site on Amazon, it clearly states that it is an unlocked phone compatible with AT&T;'s network. I also looked up the technical settings for both the 6300 and C3-01 and compared them, they're both basically the same...not really any differences that I could determine...the phone should have worked!!! So, a bit heartbroken, I boxed up the phone and sent it back to Amazon. I could have gotten a replacement, but instead opted for a refund as Amazon doesn't really provide any technical support for the phone...I can't call someone up and get any technical advice or clarification. Maybe the phone I got was just a dud, but it looked brand new out of the box and I'm fairly convinced it was some kind of network compatibility issue, although, a quad band GSM phone should function fine on AT&Ts; network.
