I've had older phones with the same size screen and I could see things much better, but maybe it's just me. I also have a problem getting rid of pop-ups! I uninstalled an app that I thought was the culprit and it still pops up.  I finally went to just reset the phone to factory settings and assumed the pin was the common last four digits of the cell number and THAT FAILED. I tried EVERY combination of numbers I could think of. I finally call Cricket and they tell me it's the last four digits of the cell#.  NOT!!!!  I lost contact with them and to this day they haven't even attempted to call me back to resolve it. (Doesn't sound like they could help me and I didn't have the energy left to call them back yet.) So not only CAN'T I reset my own phone I can't even put my OWN lock code on it.  On a positive note, I think for the money the phone is good. I play my music and it's plenty loud. People can hear me pretty well over the speaker I'm told also. I get on gmail and facebook ok.  (Small but accessible)  I do wish the actual facebook app could be installed but again--you get what you pay for.  For now, this phone and plan is within my budget so I'm sticking with it until I can get a droid with a bigger screen.  I'm happy to not be in a contract and at least the option of a nicer phone rather inexpensively.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "not so good", "Author": "warren", "ReviewID": "R2PEGM3YA350H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone has the ability to make and recieve calls , but that is about it.

I would rate this as a very convoluted phone. You sometimes get less than what you pay for. This model must have been a known failure and someone found this way to get rid of the ones already made.

Oddo \"college student\"", "ReviewID": "R3RM7BUHD6Q11E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst phone I have ever used.Before Cricket started on the sim-card-free serial-number-based phones for the paygo service, their more economic models (made by Kyocera) were sleek and performed the basic call and text message functions well, if only that.This more recent Huawei serial-number-based model suffers from nonsensical menu hierarchies, poor usability design and weak overall functionality. You simply can't rely on this phone working. Specifically:The microphone comes through incredibly muffled. Although the speaker phone is much more reliable, if you try to make a call and end up leaving a voice message, who's to know that the recipient could even hear your message? When I make calls, even with proper hand-holding of the device with enough distance from the microphone, I still get complaints about not others not being able to hear me through the phone.The menus and applications load incredibly slowly (camera and picture viewing, sometimes simple browsing) and, while this is more of an issue with Cricket, many of the applications are just there for you to pay for and activate...did I mention that some of the features have built in banner advertisements on them when you use this phone with Cricket?The poor keyboard layout and size means you'll frequently misspell words.Despite having a keypad locking function, the phone will sometimes turn itself off.If you put it in your pocket, there is a chance that you will not hear the sound of a phone call or text message receipt. In fact, in one particular instance the phone was ringing in my pocket, I took it out and as I did the entire phone just shut off completely.This may be a Cricket issue, but some text messages will simply fail and remain in the outbox instead of getting sent again later on their own. With a previous Cricket service 2 years ago, I had text messages that appeared to have been sent from the phone, but no one actually received them. Similarly, I had had text messages sent to me that I did not receive.If you're planning on relying on this model as an alarm to wake you up in the morning, don't, because at least twice the phone has failed to work as an alarm. I think there may have been an issue with the alarm while the phone is plugged into a charger, or maybe there is an issue related to setting multiple alarms at different times that are set to ring \"out of time order\" if that makes sense.I bought this model from Bestbuy Mobile as part of the Cricket Wireless paygo plan and, while it came with an optional, no-questions guarantee to replace the phone with the *same* model for about $10 more at the time of purchase, I'm wondering if they would let me downgrade for a different model without losing the phone number...Do not buy this phone. Maybe try a more economical version first, but definitely get a warranty, and be cautious about Cricket Wireless as a provider.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth your money at any price", "Author": "bonnie blue", "ReviewID": "R12RN9JU66TBS5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have only owned 1 phone worse than this one - the samsung messager.  Like said in other reviews - convoluted - NO USER MANUAL (cannot find one anywhere on the web) to tell you how to use even the most elementary features of this phone. Verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry disappointed as I have been with both phones I have purchased from Cricket.  After owning a slider keyboard, thought I would prefer the \"blackberry\" style, but both have been worthless.  I don't use the internet feature - just talk and text - and most of the time just find out how to do things by hit and miss or by accident.  Terrible glare on screen, photo quality is poor.  I have to admit I'm not tech savvy, but to talk and text?  Really?  Don't feel like I should have to be.  Wanted loud ringer and speaker - not!  Don't learn the hard way like I did.

I read all these reviews and tons more before I went to buy the phone but I ended up getting it really cheap so I got it anyway. (they didn't have a working one there I could try out)I agree with the previous poster, this phone is CHEESY! I haven't even owned a smartphone yet but my last phone was the LG enV Touch and going from that to this was soo disappointing.When I bought this phone a few days ago I got all the picture msging and internet stuff so I could try it out on this phone and that same night I got online and changed my plan because it is POINTLESS to have internet on this phone.Another thing I don't like is the keyboard. I was looking for something with a full keyboard, especially going from the LG enV Touch which has just about the best keyboard I think is made on a phone, and this one is very hard to use.The phone is also kind of confusing to navigate and I feel that I am pretty darn tech savvy.All in all like I said I will be going and upgrading to probably the Huawei Ascend 2, which my husband got a few weeks ago and aside from the short battery life and no real keyboard is a huge upgrade from this Pillar.I don't even normally write reviews but I felt like this one was warranted after I searched a lot for reviews and still ended up getting the phone.Only good thing, it's not the ugliest phone :)", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for the price", "Author": "mari gallegos", "ReviewID": "R19OIQMHKPISI2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is a fairly good phone for the purchase price, the only thing my son complains about is that it doesn't have picture messaging.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "its a phone", "Author": "chris forker", "ReviewID": "R3VEZ9CJAYGS94", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "if you are used to a smart phone,don't buy it. but If you just need a phone and texting device that takes pictures,it's a good buy.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its a great phone", "Author": "Racquel Jones", "ReviewID": "R3601PT8IIN7TN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this phone type and Ive always stuck with it.

I had a dinky little Nokia phone for years that finally was outdated (meaning Net10 wouldn't put minutes on it anymore because the software was so old). So I needed something in a hurry. I purchased this new at RadioShack (and it cost $19.99) and I have to say...it's fine. The sound is fine, texting is fine, you can customize it to a degree, it plays music, there's even a camera.  No, there isn't a manual, but c'mon people...it wasn't that hard to figure out...and I'm past 60 yrs old. If it bites the dust in a couple of months...I'm only out $25.

McWhorter", "ReviewID": "R2B0PM1DDU7KMW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this thing for about a month so granted I'm still getting use to it, even with reading the manual.  I wanted to get rid of my expensive real phone plan and chose this one because of the unlimited texting.  It works and all but there are several things that annoy me with it:Web pages lock up, constantly.  It's like trying to use a dial up to connect with anything, you click on it and set it down for a minute while it loads and about as functional as using the internet browser on a Wii.There are only 5 alarms you can set.  It sounds like plenty unless you use said alarms for taking medication, checking blood sugar, or if your employer is anal about clocking in/out at the exact time like mine. So yea, my own pet peeve but still worth noting if this is important to you.It also does not allow you to put in address information for contacts, again my own pet peeve but this is a stupid feature to leave off.I have yet to figure out how to shut off the 911 auto dialer, which is unfortunate.  Even with the keypad locked, if you throw this bitch in your pocket or bra and anything hits the Q/# button, it pulls you up a 911 selection page where it can autodial them for you, yay.  Speaking of the keypad, you can't turn the keypad tone off, you can only change the pitch.I live in town, a college town so it's fairly large, and the connection is really quiet (yes I've turned the volume up, thanks) and it cuts out slightly.  You also have a pretty limited selection of ringtones to download from their store, I am going to try out different sites to see if any of those work on it so all is not lost.Cricket customer service was 50/50.  It took 4 transfers to get me to the right department to port in my old phone number even though I told them first thing that's what I needed to do (make sure your old account is still active or they can't do this btw).  They didn't really explain anything or go over the contract with me, they just kind of said what do you want and I had to keep asking questions to clarify parts of the service I wasn't sure about.TLDR; It's ok if you just want a cheap phone service with unlimited texting and not a lot of usable features", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Dorcas Sanchez", "ReviewID": "R34G5HWFIGSJ5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son loved it.

There's no option to turn off keypad volume, so if you are in a quiet place and need to text, it'll be loud. The camera is low-quality and not worth it. Plus, I can't figure out how to import my contacts into this phone. I tried the bluetooth connection and the sd card, but nothing worked. It's a very lightweight and small phone.
