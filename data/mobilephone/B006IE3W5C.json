It's so easy to text and the picture quality isn't that bad either. The back of the phone is textured so it doesn't show fingerprints or scratches. This phone is slim and fits in your pocket easily. The menu is easy to navigate and the web while only 3G, isn't as bad as you might think.  I really like this phone. The battery life has been terrific. I've used it a lot and I've used it very little. Either way the battery life was still great. I was thinking of switching to the AT&T; Fusion but I am reluctant to give up this phone. Are there faster, higher end phones out there? Sure. This does what I want which is to text and make phone calls.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Had for 6 months", "Author": "Eowyn", "ReviewID": "R3NEDDAA5GGARC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to get away from Straight Talk's lack of decent phones and looked into AT&T;'s selection. Without wanting to pay for an extra data plan and looking for an insanely expensive phone I settle on this one. I am very please with it. I tend to drop my phone A LOT and this one has outlasted many before it with no adverse effects on it. It has also withstood being dropped in a puddle or two.I like the graphics and the call quality seems to be pretty good.The only thing I don't like is that there is no shortcut key to take you directly to your text conversations - you have to dig into the menu and go that route for them. It doesn't sound like much but I text more than I talk and it would be nice to have that option.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for calls and texting", "Author": "R.

It is rather slim, and fits conveniently in any small purse or pocket. However, it does have a couple of drawbacks. The first (which I have come to get used to) is the relatively cramped qwerty keyboard. At just over 2 inches wide, there is little room for a full keyboard, however, the Link combats this using tapered and raised keys making the problem less obvious. Additionally, after just a week, I am typing with ease.The other issue that I have run into is the small amount of memory for messages. I have to empty my inbox about every other day in order to keep my phone from freezing up. Which I really don't have a problem with, other than its slight inconvenience.But overall, this is a great little phone.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good simple texting phone", "Author": "PAZ \"PAZ\"", "ReviewID": "R267G8ERBEF8YZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone back in April, since then no real problems.  It was a used phone but came in mint condition.  The only con is the battery discharges quickly when I am on a call.  I bought a new battery which increased the life a little but still drains fast when on calls.  Also, you have to be careful not to have it too close to your face or else your voice gets muffled.  Sometimes it fails to send texts but I think that is the area I am in not the phone.  AT&T; informed me that if there is road work going on close by (which there is in my area), it will interfere with signals.  Other than that, its easy to use  very slim and sturdy, slides into pockets easily.  The keyboard locks so not to worry about it making \"butt' calls.  I've been happy with it but now looking for a phone with a larger keyboard.

Obtained the phone as a stop-gap until my more full featured smartphone is ready. So I have been using this phone for a few days and my initial impressions are that good. Some odd quirks when performing text entry that are outweighed by the convenience of having a QWERTY keyboard (with a .com key! Nice!). The web browser is very basic and loading Opera web browser from Opera.com is stymied by the phones need to alert/ask permission from you incessantly everytime there is data access from the Opera browser app. The phone really seems to shine with it's support of the various webmail providers (AOL, AIM, GMAIL, Hotmail/Windows Live, Yahoo). On the Instant Messaging front the Pantech supports AIM, Microsoft Messenger, and Yahoo Messenger. I tried the Microsoft Messenger but kept getting \"check your Network Connection settings\" which looked fine.In the brief time I have used it, I found the phone capable and even a bit fun!", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for a non smart phone", "Author": "Patrick Womersley \"Pat in Mur \"A\" Vul\"", "ReviewID": "R1QCA0Q9QZDBD6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "worth it for the price.  works good but is just not intuitive to get around in the menus.  internet connection is slow", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "I am buying it for the second time", "Author": "Elwood P.

My wife went through two phones and it never occurred to me that I should get a new one because I enjoyed this one. Another 6 months later and I picked out another Pantech phone. A touch screen, newer, \"modern\" yada yada... Now less than three months with the new phone and I am here to order the Pantech P7040 Link again. It does so much more than you think and it so easy to operate. Best of all NO touch screen. It has all the navigational shortcuts you will need. You just have to learn how to set them without a touch screen to assist you. Remember buttons are your friend.Bottom two lines:If you want a phone that will make clear calls, text quickly, has a useful calendar and shortcut functions, and has useful organizational functions then this is a great choice. If you want to impress people or spend your family time on Twitter and Facebook then this is the opposite of what you want.Peace.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pantech Link P7040 Phone", "Author": "Deanne H.

But, she did want something that would make texting a lot easier.  This phone fit the bill perfectly.  Sound on it is great, even on the speakerphone.  It doesn't drop calls, and the battery seems to last a long time.  Texting is a breeze and it seems to be laid out very logically.  My wife loves it!  She says it's just the right size....not too heavy or bulky.  I'd recommend it for sure.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Junk battery.", "Author": "Mistyn74", "ReviewID": "R1I7YU9ERNPTCS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this phone off Amazon for my husband.

Phone.  Ever.", "Author": "Frederick Mann", "ReviewID": "R3M5JCGMXIAQV3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've owned a Pantech Link for close to a year now.  I strongly recommend buying any other phone.  The main problem is this: my phone turns off randomly approximately 10 times a day.  I miss phone calls and text messages every day.  Sometimes it even turns off in the middle of a text message.  This is unrelated to the battery charge (which, by the way is slightly below average).  Another minor problem is the small amount of memory the phone has for text messages.  I don't know the exact number, but it seems like I have to delete all my messages after sending/receiving about 200-300 texts.  The battery life and memory space are minor frustrations, but the random power loss is incredibly annoying.
