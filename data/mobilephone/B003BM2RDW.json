{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sidekick LX Product Review", "Author": "TGM", "ReviewID": "RPJGHDCIDF4Y8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had recently purchased an unlocked sidekick LX from Ebay and found the following characteristics. I had not purchased this exact model from this seller on Amazon.  My phone had the following characteristics:- This is a pretty good looking phone. The flap rotates to the left and spins out if you tap it on the left bottom corner.  If you leave the phone inside a bag, the flap can swing around and open if jostled around inside the bag.  There is a lock/unlock feature on the keyboard, so there is no danger of dialing numbers inadvertantly.- The keyboard is pretty nice to use. It has some nice features for finding names, notes, To Do items etc.- the camera is medicore.  You will need to install a mini sd card in order to store pictures, songs and video.- The sound is a little low. The speakerphone is very low. Most of the (cheaper) phones I had used in the past had better speakerphones.- You can lose all of your contacts, notes, to do list etc. if you remove the battery and/or the SIM card. Apparently you need to create a danger account and store all of this information online.  In order to do this, you need to have data services.  If you store all of this info online, you can download them when you lose them.  It would be nice if this information was stored directly on the phone.- My phone came with a earbud (for both  ears). The sound quality with the earbuds is pretty good. But if you are a speakerphone person, this is not the right phone for you.- My phone made a constant hissing sound when I used it to make calls. It also made some clicking noises at times.- The sidekick LX was previously sold by T-Mobile.  They discontinued selling it around mid-2010. T-Mobile still supports it though.  So you can call T-Mobile for technical issues and they will be willing to help you.- I received a USB cable with the phone.  But this seemed to be of no use except that i could charge the phone by connecting it to my computer. I could not use it to sync the phone to the computer and transfer data. If you intend to do this, it would be a good idea to find out how to do this (and if this can be done) before you purchase the phone.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "....", "Author": "James Hammond", "ReviewID": "RIFMAB2C7EPYQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "uh...well....to be honest i never even used this once i got it...i was in italy and they arent compatible...but i mean...its a sidekick, those are cool right?", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "no more sidekick service after 5/31/2011", "Author": "J.
