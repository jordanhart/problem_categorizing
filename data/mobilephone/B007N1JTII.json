However, the phone need to be recharged every few hours and this makes me dislike it as it embarases me sometime because by six to seven hours the phone is useless unless it is rechsrged.  For this reason, i do not reSony commend others to buy this model.  Unfortunately, there are now a total of 4 Xperia Sonny smartphones in the family and all have the same problem.
