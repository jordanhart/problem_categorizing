I sideloaded many apps it lacked, Pandora, Instagram, and skype and it works so much better than my old iPhone5 I didn't know if i wanted to get rid of the iphone but honestly i was tired of the boring OS, the battery kept dying the first couple of days but finally i let it die completely and charged it and now it last me about 16 hours with moderate use the iphone usually at 30% by the 10th hour and dead by the 14th.Pros:silky smooth OSThe camera features are AMAZINGBBM IS BACK!!!!the keyboard is amazing (although there is a learning curve once you get used to it you'll be typing faster than on any other device out there)the device is smooth and has a nice grip on the back you can use it without the case and you don't get the fragile \"it might slip\" feeling like you do with iPhones it feels very durable (like most blackberry's)Cons-their are a few bugs but it is a new device so its to be expected (theres an update coming in march which should fix the most annoying onesit wasn't free i wanted a free phoneconclusion-Blackberry nailed it, i have many of my iphone friends waiting for it to launch here in the US so they can pick it up. I'm proud to say that i'm probably one of the first with it here in arizona :D", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blackberry have nailed it", "Author": "Cuthbert \"techgeek\"", "ReviewID": "R3OTXLD21OGY17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using the Z10 for a month in UK. The phone is amazing. People carping about plastic case don't know what they are talking about. The chassis is solid stainless steel with black or white finish. I proved this wth a magnet. The BB10 QNX O/S is rock stable. No crashes so far. The browser is awesome. The keyboard is great too. As well as native apps, the phone also contains an Android run time environment which will be upgraded to the latest Android Jellybean version in due course. I can sideload android gingerbread apps at the moment like Kindle. Thousands of android apps have been ported to the phone already and many thousands more natively coded apps are available. This is unprecedented for such a new O/S. Screen resolution is amongst the best on the market. A common inbox(hub) for all incoming social and email comms is a great feature. GPS, Accelerometer and electronic compass work fine as does NFC. I have NFC tags stuck on my laptop to ring frequent numbers or instantly pull up key apps like the calendar. You can plug the phone into a TV or monitor hdmi port and connect a bluetooth keyboard and mouse. The phone will then outperform many laptops especially as it can handle MS Office files (Word, Excel, Powerpoint)and .pdf out of the box. Most phone functions can also be voice controlled.Battery life is adequate but needs managing like turning off wifi and NFC if not being used and religiously charging each night. No Netflix app yet or Banking apps like Pingit but hopefully they will come. Be aware also that Amazon don't currently support MP3 downloads directly to the phone. Hope they fix that soon. My biggest concern is the leather Blackberry pouch I bought which features the sleep magnet. The phone is a very tight fit and I max out the volume control when I pull out the phone. I guess I can live with that.

On Apple's and Android's app store I find myself flooded with non-relevant selections and wasting my time shifting through trying to find what I am looking for.  On Blackberry's App store I do not have this problem.  Some may find the number of apps on the Blackberry App Store as discouraging while as I find it a blessing for that fact alone.I am no longer an Android fan as their Operating Systems just seem to crash or freeze up more than anything else.

The back has a nice grippy battery cover, which feels great in the hand (I found the S3/S4 to be way too slippery and drop friendly with the polished, curved back).  The edges are a bit squared off, allowing a good hold, however on the front top and bottom, it flares off a bit, allowing a very nice ergonomic feel when typing.  The hardware specs are up there with the best of the current phones, save for hte newest quad core S4 (which was rated very closely), however under heavy load and multiple tasks, the machine didn't break a sweat.  The screen is a higher resolution/inch and contrast than the newest iPhone, and competes with the newest top of the line droids.  I watch hockey in HD streaming on it, and it's fantastic, fast and crisp, with super contrast.The accessible battery is great for backups, as under heavy load, it's hard to get through a full day.  Moderate to light load makes a full day between charges no problem.  For travelers, the ability to have a spare battery charged seems like a bonus.  Sim and expandable mSD are located easily behind the cover as well.  Also, the phone has an HDMI port, and other standard power/headphone access.The blackberry OS has broken new ground in a number of ways, primarily with a very slick and user friendly gesture (swipe) based navigation that allows good one handed use for everything but typing more than a quick text message.  All messages are easily found with a simple swipe to the right, \"uncovering\" the hub, which is always just a simple peek below whatever else you're doing.  It took half a day to master, and I now can't figure out how I lived without it, with all my messages in different places.  It's brilliant.The browser is fast and conveniently laid out, and features the ability to force full websites (which is fantastic for when you're in 4G or WiFi, as the phone runs the Web very nicely given ts screen and processing hardware.The keyboard is the best touch keyboard on the market.  Even with the dreaded word suggestion feature (assuming you leave it on), it actually corrects most mistakes without you even knowing you made them by having it embedded in the space key.  I turned the feature off last week, and realized how much it was helping me (which was embarrassing!).App support for very app heavy users is the only weakness.  I'm not huge on instagram and the more advanced apps, so I'm not heavily impacted by this.  Additionally, the blackberry allows the ability to load android apps (side-load) which makes almost the entire android market available for the z10.  So far, I've had all the apps I needed available including many popular ones everyone knows (news papers, games, sports, etc.)Buy with confidence.

The gestures are very natural and if you pick up any phone or touch device after you are guaranteed to try them on it.forget the old blackberry, no sticking freezing or battery pulls needed.

Lewis", "ReviewID": "R2HKMXI8VQM2AW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So with all the quality luxury car brands out there, why did I choose Tesla for the analogy? Like the new Blackberry \"10\" series of phones, Tesla arrives at it's luxury and overall driving experience by cleverly blending innovation with simplicity and efficiency. And, Tesla is a newer luxury car brand that is (for now anyway) serving a niche audience and trying desperately to catch on with the masses amidst more established brands. And unfortunately, consumers who choose to overlook Tesla because it is not established are missing out on something that is simply better.The new Blackberry 10 operating system is so good that OUT OF THE BOX it is a complete system ready to be enjoyed and ready for productivity. Try doing that with an Android phone. My Android phone has Kit Kat (the latest os) and it took me weeks of downloading and trying out various apps to get the phone to perform to my satisfaction and to do what this one does right out of the box. I mean lets be honest here, let's cut to the chase- when your phone's operating system along with it's native apps will not perform correctly or lacks certain important features, and you go to Google Play for an app that will do it better, what you are in a sense doing is downloading a patch. Go to your Android or IOS settings menu and call up the list of downloaded apps... that's right... your phone is FULL of os patches. The new Blackberry 10 is clearly the superior root operating system when compared to IOS or Android.When it comes to contact management, SMS, the dialer, email, file system management, keyboard, web browsing, voice recording, notifications, photo management - there is no need for improvement with aftermarket apps. So please, don't reply to this review with comparisons of the size of Blackberry's app store vs. google's and apple's. I get it.So let's go beyond the reliability of Blackberry's new and innovative operating system and discuss some specifics about this Z10 phone that I love. I want to start with 'The Hub' because a phone is primarily a device for communications, right? Well then, what a great idea it would be to have any and all communications - you name it, tweets, texts, voice mails, call logs, facebook updates, IM's, emails, whatever you want - centrally located and \"peekable\" (for lack of a better term) with a simple swipe. Introducing The Hub. Regardless of what the phone happens to be in the middle of doing, a short swipe up from the bottom gives an initial peek of simple icons (with counter) indicating the type and number of new communications you have received. Now continue the swipe slightly to the right and the screen will slide to reveal yet a further peek for more specifics as to who, what and when. Now finish the swipe right if you want to actually open up and interact with The Hub. Very nice! The Hub is agile and customizable. One of my favorite customizations is the pinch function for each type of communication portal in the hub. What this does is give you an alternative view consisting of only messages that meet your customized parameters. For example, lets say that for my gmail account I want my alt view to be only sent messages and also only those I sent to coworkers. When I go to the hub and open gmail I see everything. But if I pinch, everything literally starts squishing down until, poof, all disappears except for only those messages I've sent, and sent only to coworkers. And keep in mind that The Hub is not merely a gateway where you go to launch say an SMS app or a browser or app that gets you to your facebook account...all messaging is done right there. Very impressive.Next up is the neat settings menu and it's customizability. When you call up the settings menu you will always have access to ALL the settings (wi-fi, bluetooth, accounts, sound settings, flashlight, battery monitor, device monitor, airplane mode, brightness/white balance and display, apps, alarms and notifications, voice control settings, security, etc.) because right at the top of the list will always be the button called, well, \"Settings\". But I like how right on that initial settings page you can customize which settings functions will appear. It's like a quick links page.Next up, battery life - This phone comes with an 1800 mAh battery (removable!!) and for some reason the battery life on this phone consistently blows away that of my other phone which has a 2200 mAh battery. I can't really explain this. My only theory is that because this is such a \"young\" operating system, and one which was specifically designed in conjunction with the Blackberry \"10\" series of phones, it is an extremely streamlined system without any bloat and extraneous or redundant processing going on in the background. But admittedly that's just guessing.This phone has no \"home screen\" per se, which is awesome. This is because of Blackberry's focus on multitasking, productivity and simplicity. You do not have to keep tapping the Home button or the recent app button in order to proceed on to another application that you want to use. Instead, when you are done using an application just flick up from the bottom of the screen and it closes, gets pinned to the wallpaper, and turns into a widget-like live tile (for example, if you were on twitter the little tile would continue to show you your latest twitter feeds). You can have up to 8 tiles (4 on a screen) before the system begins to sequentially turn them off as others go onto the wall, and they can be turned off manually as well. To view all applications just swipe left.The operation of new Blackberry phones is very dependent on getting the swiping gestures down. It can be tricky at first but once you learn it, the phone is a real treat to use and is very interesting, intuitive and user friendly. The screen quality and resolution is stunning to look at, the phone itself is well built, exudes quality and is handsome looking. I am very psyched to have discovered the Blackberry Z10 as well as it's fantastic operating system.

Before I converted to iPhone with the first iPhone, I was an avid blackberry user & lover. This makes that loving feeling come back a bit. The way the inbox is managed is beautiful. The way the OS swipes and moves around is simple and great. The speed is ok, not great, but not bad either. The screen looks great, the weight & size are good, overall, I'm very pleased about this device! If you're at a company that requires blackberry, this is certainly the best option available and it's quite a large step up from previous options. That being said, the severe current lack of apps is probably enough of a buzzkill for a lot of people to steer clear.All I can hope is that additional apps come along.

Developers has anemic support for this new Blackberry operating system so I don't see future development of popular apps for this smartphone, I don't see any reason to spend so much money for a smartphone like BB10 if only you will use it for text messaging, voice and few apps. Some functionality are also buggy (With bugs), battery is not good enough to last if you browse a lot. Maybe be if they lower the price below $100 as compare to other smartphone with the same feature as this I may consider, I think paying more than $600 dollars for this phone is a waste of monies . Buyer beware cause this operating system may not last just like other new smartphone operating system without application developers support. Companies are starting pilot testing to convert from Blackberry to Iphone and Android smartphone so I think it is better to invest in the future and learn new technologies than stick with this new operating system that don't have support of major developers and popular tech companies like Microsoft, Netflix, facebook, google etc. Take note that if you buy this smartphone facebook, Netflix and other popular apps is not supporting and developing apps for this smartphone so you may regret spending a whooping $600 plus for smartphone like this.Buyer specially current user of blackberry should also realize that this new blackberry is totally different from the old blackberry phone they have before, this one has new operating system, functionality and features, so effort in learning how to use this is similar to learning how to use the much popular smartphone like iphone, android and even windows phone. Iphone, android and even windows are tested and with strong big hi-tech company support and application developers support, so why not spend your effort in learning popular and tested smartphone instead of spending so much money for this new blackberry smartphone that I for sure will be gone in the future. Without developers and big hi tech company support this new blackberry operating system will be gone in next couple of years.I hate it when consumers are being reap off, if you buy this phone for close to $700 including taxes what you get is a phone good for texting, browsing the internet and emails, very few popular apps are available for this phone yes they have 100,000 apps but most of the popular one are android apps, if the underlying android apps where updated user of this phone will have problem using them unless they manually upgrades. If you buy apple, android and windows phone after two years you can sell them and get some money back or you can even trade them to get new phone, this blackberry phone, theres nothing you can do with this phone after two years it maybe gone and there is not enough senior citizen to buy this phone in the future.
