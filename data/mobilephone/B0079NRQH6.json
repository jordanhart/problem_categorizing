{"Reviews": [{"Title": "After 1.5 years, and an upgrade...", "Author": "sauprankul", "ReviewID": "R1G56DLE46GPOC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE April 22nd, 2014:Well, it's been a while. The S5 is here and costs about four times as much as this phone. I still wouldn't say that the S2 is a bad phone. It was a trailblazer. It was one of the first appealing mainstream Android phones. Its feature set, quantitatively speaking, is comparable to that of today's phones, which tells you how little things have changed since. The hercules (that is its codename) can run Android 4.4 if you root it (and trust me, this phone is AMAZINGLY easy to modify) and install CyanogenMod 11. After all these years, it's STILL a good value. Competition like the Oneplus One(<$400), the Nexus 5 ($350), the Motorola X($340) and Moto G($200) all are very nice phones designed for people on a budget. The last one, the Moto G, comes close in price, but the specs are actually slightly worse on that. So I don't hesitate when I say this: If you want a phone around the $200 price range, there is probably no better option than this one. I would HIGHLY recommend that you step up your budget to something like a Oneplus One or a Nexus 5, both of which rival today's $800 phones for half the price. However, I realize that's not an option for everyone, and this phone works fine for everyday use.INITIAL REVIEW:This phone was released in 2011. It is now close to the end of 2013. If you know technology, you know that essentially means this phone is as good as dead and gone.You would be wrong, though.Story of my life: I bought the HTC One S around a year and a half ago, but its camera exaggerated colors, so I swapped it for the then somewhat dated, but the next best, S2. I had wanted the iPhone(which wasn't available on T-Mobile), but now I was stuck with a (or so I thought) second rate Android.Well, I did have complaints. It was laggy. The battery life sucked. It wasn't made of fancy glass and metal. Boo hoo.Well, I sucked it up, and used it.AESTHETICS: The black one looks... not as good. The plastic bezel is glossy, and looks cheap. The white one, on the other hand, has a matte bezel, which looks more like anodized Aluminium. The back on the white one is glossy(unlike the black one), but it doesn't looks bad. It's just slippery(again, unlike the black one). This phone, otherwise, has a very nice, industrial look to it. It feels extremely solid in the hand (unlike the S4). The width of the phone takes getting used to; that was the main reason I dropped it, reaching over to the extreme corners. One (small)complaint I have is about the speaker \"hump\". There's more going on in there, but the phone cannot be laid down flat. I would say the white S2 looks and feels beautiful, more so than the black one. EDIT: So apparently the white one can't be found. Oh well, a case will mask the bezel.DURABILITY: I bought a Ballistec Case for it, considering it was my first phone, but guess what? You don't need it! This phone has been dropped, chucked(don't ask), flung onto latches, lockers, pavement and tile with no case(you get tired of Ballistec cases), and it hasn't broken. The plastic bezel, while unsightly, crunches and dents under impact, which allows it withstand greater impacts without transferring force to the screen. Kind of life a bumper. It also keeps the glass from touching when laid flat. I would suggest getting a simple TPU case, just so reduce the number of dents that appear on the bezel. I bought the Diztronic one; it was nice.CAMERA: The camera is decent under good lighting, but the best part is the color reproduction. It's better than my HTC One(which is widely regarded as the best phone you can buy as of October 2013). Don't expect to be blown away by the camera, but it's definitely usable, especially under good lighting. There tends to be a lot of noise in low lit scenes, but that's to be expected. The app is great, though it lacks the fancy features of today's phones. But it has everything you'll expect from a modern smartphone, and then some. The rate of capture, however, is terrible. So are the exposure times, but, whatever. It's a 2011 cell phone. The front facing camera is very lacking, and less than great in almost every lighting except ideal. If you're into the whole \"selfie\"(actually, this word is in the Oxford now) thing, I don't recommend using this phone. It is however, good enough for video chatting. If you can hold still, then most pictures will come out fine.DISPLAY: This phone has a 4.5 inch AMOLED display. The resolution of this phone is a low 800x640, which isn't terrible. It just means things won't be as sharp. It has a pixel density of 206ppi, which is much lower than what Apple says is the Retina barrier(300ppi). I have a 470ppi, 1080p phone, and I still think that the resolution of the S2 isn't that bad. That's saying something. AMOLED displays are very nice for colors, but, in my experience, use more battery than other technologies, and aren't as good in the sunlight. That applies here. Don't expect to be able to see very well outdoors. It has glare and isn't bright enough for that. However, the low resolution means that the processor doesn't have to work as hard! That's kind of optimistic, but it's a valid point.BUT WAIT, there's more!ROOTING:/**I am not responsible for anything that happens to you, your phone, or anything else. This review is simply my opinion, and you are free to ignore it.*/Android, like the Linux it is based off of, allows you to grant \"superuser\" access to the apps on your phone(which includes the interface). This means you can alter the files in the \"root\" of your phone, and change things that the manufacturer would not want you to.\"Oh no! What is he doing? Why is he condoning the use of illegal software?!\" Nope, it's not illegal, it just voids your warranty. EDIT: So apparently, this exact phone comes with no warranty. I would assume Amazon would still uphold its items for at least 30 days. I recommend Galaxy S2 root dot com. The guy there has tons of info on how to go about doing this.You'll also want to join the XDA forums and join the community of fellow T989 users there who have rooted their phones.If you root and install a custom ROM, you'll have access to:1) Wi-Fi hotspot: Why should carriers be able to tell you how to use your data? Doing THIS blatantly usually gets you a warning, followed by service termination from the carrier. But if you stay withing your limits, you should be fine.2) \"Move to SD Card\": There is a review here saying that Google is in on something, and doesn't allow you to install apps to the SD card. Well, most ROMs, especially CyanogenMod, allow you to do just this. I'm pretty sure this is a limitation of, not a restriction on, Android, and you need root access to be able to do this.3) Under/overclocking: You can change the settings on your phone to save power or to get better performance. I don't recommend this, as you have the potential to fry your phone, but hey! your call.4) Customization: The \"splash screen\"(the logo you see when you boot) can be changed, the boot animation can be changed, the theme colors can be changed, etc.5) Remove bloatware: Any app you don't like or want you can hibernate(not allow any background activity) via Greenify or completely uninstall via Titanium backup. Be careful when doing this though.Notes: Be careful. Read a LOT before you do anything. Make sure you flash the right firmware, or else you'll ruin your phone. You can't use software for the international S2 or any other variant of it. It needs to specifically be for the T989.BATTERY LIFE: So, after installing CyanogenMod, I am easily able to get a day if not two of very mild usage(<1 hour). You will definitely run out in a single day if you are on it for more than, say, an hour and a half. You can find a whole bunch of battery saving tips online. Don't expect to be blown away, though. There's not much to say. It used to be terrible, but now it's decent. I believe the 4.1 update by Samsung actually helped. I can't be sure though.PERFORMANCE: The S2 has a very low resolution screen, but a powerful chip. This gives it an advantage in terms of performance. With CyanogenMod 10.1, which is based off of Android 4.2, there is little to no lag in the UI, thanks to Project Butter, and other enhancements. It runs most games pretty well, and some very well, especially 2D games like DoodleJump and Jetpack Joyride. It can run Asphalt 8, the latest graphic game for Android, on Medium settings at an expectedly mediocre frames per second. On Very Low settings, it runs very well, and actually looks pretty nice, too. Apps do take a little while to start up, though. Again, don't expect to be blown away.SOUND: OK, so this phone has a tiny speaker way in the corner, on the back. It's tinny, and can crack sometimes. But it's plenty loud for normal situations. I'm comparing this to my boombox of a phone (the HTC One has BoomSound), and therefore biased. If you are going to listen to music, or doing anything sound-related in public or otherwise noisy places, you're going to want a pair of headphones, which is not included. With CyanogenMod, and plenty of other ROMs, you get access to equalizers and other cool stuff, though, which is nice.SOFTWARE: Touchwiz by Samsung has often been blasted for its existence. In 2012, I agreed. But with the 4.1 update, I have to say, I really don't have any complaints except for the cartoonish look (which is entirely subjective). It has quick toggles and well... actually, I can't remember all the stuff, but it definitely has a lot. There's very little lag, which is nice, especially compared to when I first got this phone. Samsung is the best at keeping its phones updated with the latest features. The usefulness of those features, however, is debatable. CyanogenMod is very barebones, but is aesthetically more appealing. 4.3 will soon be ready for everyday use, which means your 2011 phone will be running the latest release of Android as of October 2013. There are several other ROMs out there with features I can't begin to describe, so really, if you're new to Android, you're in for a treat.OVERALL: For it price, the S2 is definitely a huge value. It has a workable camera, decent battery life, a nice display, and a smooth, feature packed OS. You won't be blown away by anything really. You can't expect much considering this phone is worth less than 300 bucks. That's for a functional, portable, telephone, PC, MP3 player, camera, alarm clock, gaming console, etc. The best part is, this phone does it well. You'll get a better bang for your buck if you root it, though. You'll get access to far more features, even some that the reviewers here are complaining about. Just don't do it immediately; make sure your phone isn't defective, and use it normally for about a month. Then, go to galaxy s2 root . com and unlock your S2's full potential.You can't expect much of this phone. That said, the more I play around with my S2, the more I wonder if my upgrade to the One was really worth it. Some would shoot me down for simply questioning the One, some would do so for owning a smartphone. Bottom line is, if you're on a tight budget, this is one of the best phones you can currently buy.Recommended stuff:Nova Launcher, Titanium Backup (root), Greenify (root), Kingsoft Office, Asphalt 8, Google Keyboard, Google Drive, Diztronic TPU case, headphones.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, but has a few issues.", "Author": "MagnoliaSouth \"As soon go kindle fire with sn...", "ReviewID": "R15IBF0N9E45HO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought mine through a special offer at Best Buy. This is now considered an older model (at present the S4 is the current model) and I couldn't see paying hundreds for an old model so I found a deal elsewhere.That said, it's really a great phone but there are a few things I wish I had known about up front. Maybe they'll help you.I wish I had known that...... not all S2s are alike. As the product title indicates, this is specifically a SGH-T989 and this model is designed especially for T-Mobile.... when you're searching for a case, be sure to search for one that works with the SGH-T989 instead of just an S2 because the cases will fit differently.... smart phone batteries never last very long, especially if you stay signed in to everything. It's not a bad idea to purchase extra batteries (again, designed for the SGH-T989). I bought three of these but I can't really comment further on them because I've not received them yet. Look for my review there though, because after I use them I WILL review them.Now for the pros and cons.I like that...... it's fast and has good resolution, though I cannot compare it to much else.... it's fairly easy to use.... the camera is amazing and has a flash (but on the back only).... it has a front facing camera, but see what I don't like below too.... the video looks great.... it has voice search.... it has Google services integrated, to include backup and restore.I don't like that...... for some oddball reason, Android (the operating system this phone has) insists on installing apps on the phone, rather than a removable microSD card. I cannot fathom why this is the case. Granted, that's an OS issue, but it still affects the phone.... the front facing camera doesn't have a flash.... mine (not all, because this doesn't happen to my son's nor my daughter's) does not shut off, ever. I don't know what has caused this, but mine began all of a sudden. The reason I add it here is because NO app should ever power it back on immediately. Clearly there is a serious security flaw here. I plan on resetting it today, which I dread.Apps that make it even better are...... Swiftkey (paid, but there is a free version too, but paid is much better). I don't like Android's native keyboard and this one is great for predictive text.... Go SMS Pro (free) because for some inexplicable reason, Android does not let you customize the notification tone for each contact's incoming text message. That is, if I want a certain tone for my daughter, I cannot make hers different from everyone else's and I've no idea why Android does this, either. With this app, I can do that, but it only works if its still running.... Juice Defender Ultimate (paid; there is non-Ultimate free version too).All in all, for a smart phone I'm very pleased.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "My galaxy s2", "Author": "Zindy", "ReviewID": "RU3BV8ICOTTGG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my phone on the exact date that it was suppose to come.

Why 1 star then? Because I purchased this one from Amazon (Ross Cellular was the seller) as a gift for my wife which turned out to be a piece of junk!Upon arrival, the phone box wasn't showing the slightest sign that it's for a Tmobile phone, or even a Samsung phone. Some weird generic looking box. The phone arrived with a flimsy battery that isn't original, white in color unlike the grayish Samsung looking battery, no Samsung logo/label on it, and no NFC antenna on it. The phone itself doesn't show any Samsung/Tmobile logo on the front like the other Sgh-t989 phones you would purchase in the US market regularly.Upon operating the phone, the battery life time appeared to be horrible. We thought it would need some power cycling before performing optimally, so we kept it for a few days. Two weeks of use and the phone refused to turn on. We took out the battery and tried it on another phone, and it worked. That made us doubt the phone itself. It was just dead, refusing to turn back on, charge, or do anything for that matter.Don't purchase stuff from Ross Cellular, you have been warned.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Tresa Martin", "ReviewID": "R4R8E6EQHNAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Believe it or not, this was my first smartphone.

I learned the hard way that from now on it is a good practice to contact the seller and ask exactly what you are receiving.The phone I received came in a generic samsung s II box and did not have the same back as all the other T mobile Samsung ii phones I have seen online. It also looked like it had a new screen protector applied and NOT the one that has labels of where everything is on the phone (see unboxing videos online)The charger I received was an older wall charger. Used, dirty with some brown gunk on it. It's the same type of charger from my old samsung flip phone from the dark ages. Not the new USB wall charger.Generic battery. NOT samsung.Generic user guide that didn't really say much of anything and had nothing to do with the phone.Really displeased.The phone itself I never bothered to power on or try since I wanted to do the refund. I just purchased one from ebay and when it arrives I will post an edited review about the phone itself.EDITED To Add:I bought a brand new phone off ebay and I absolutely love this phone. It's a big step up from my HTC Status. I didn't know how I was going to like going from a querty keyboard to all touch screen, but I love the swipe keyboard. This phone has great cameras, does well on the internet. I've enjoyed everything about it except the battery.

The original phone that I wanted was the Google Nexus 4, but that sold out on Google by the time I tried to order it. I was going to wait for the Nexus 5 and because of its high-end features, the phone will most likely cost more than the 4 was going for. I'm not into the latest and greatest trend that most people my age tend to get caught up in. I wasn't about to spend a lot of money on an iPhone 5 or the Galaxy S4 just to have the latest model. I'm a college student and money is tight. I had a crappy wannabe smartphone and I needed an upgrade fast. I was going to buy it through my carrier, which is T Mobile and decided to look elsewhere because the price was ridiculous considering that this is a two year old phone.I found this on Amazon and the price was good enough to convince me to spend all of my paycheck on. I've only had it for a few days and I'm absolutely in love!MY TAKE:1. It's the perfect size. I wanted a big screen in order to read text better and to watch videos more comfortably. It's big enough to do all of that, but not too big where you need two hands or using one hand would be really strenuous and awkward. If you have normal to large sized hands, you definitely can use only one hand.2. The resolution is good. It isn't the best obviously because it's old, but the colors and text are still vibrant and clear. It's brilliant!3. The camera is solid. It's 8 megapixels in the back and 2 megapixels in the front. It comes with flash and up to 4.0X zoom. It has panorama, action shot, cartoon, beauty, and smile shot. It also has a night feature for taking photos in low lights. If you're okay with taking photos for the convenience of it, then this is the phone for you. If you need a powerful camera on your phone, look elsewhere.4. It is fast. There are virtually no lags so far when browsing the web and doing other stuff simultaneously. I usually have multiple stuff open and it doesn't slow down. Because I have 4G, there is no significant waiting time when using data.5. It's locked to T-Mobile. I immediately decided to get this one over others on this site because it's locked to my carrier and is guaranteed to work for me. Once again, THIS IS LOCKED TO T MOBILE, which means that it won't work on another carrier unless you hack it which is completely pointless and time consuming. I would not recommend getting a phone that says international version because its a hit or miss whether or not it would work in the United States. I just didn't want to take that chance.6. The battery life. I can get a solid 6 to 8 hours on the phone. While that may deter some people, its all relative. I am an active user. I'm always texting, checking Facebook, surfing the web, and listening to music so of course the battery is going to drain quicker for me. If you're an occasional user, then it can last literally all day.7. The OS. It says that it runs on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, but mine ended up running on Gingerbread. Its not that big of a deal. I don't really use apps that require later versions of the OS. Plus, I can always update the phone whenever I want.8. The speakers are decent. I have a $20 pair of Sony headphones and I must say, the speakers make them sound more expensive. Maybe that's just me. The speakers are loud enough to cancel out noise if the outside noise volume isn't too overwhelming and loud. It's not the best out there, but is good for the average user.All in all, this phone is amazing and I think it's a really good deal. If you don't care about having the latest phone and are okay with having an older model, then this phone can be a really good option. I would recommend getting a screen protector and a hard shell case with it since its kind of slippery.

Ive had my device for three days now and its hasnt given me an problems working on T-Mobile no contract plan. The device came with the USB cord and wall charger, sim card, and manuals. It didnt not come with a screen protector or a case so you might want to order those two items when order the device. I was using a Blackberry Device before Galaxy S II, u can use the sim card from the old device and it will work, but if you want the full use of the 4G network T-mobile offers use the  sim card that comes with the device. The Galaxy has a beautiful full screen easy to read, it moves flawlessly from screen to screen. The rear facing camera takes really nice clear pictures the front facing camera is a little dark but works well with taking pictures and Video chatting. Setting up my email accounts and other personal accounts were fairly easy, just follow the directions. The package was easy to track and it came on time as estimated. I gave the Samsung Galaxy four stars if i could do four and a half  stars I would the reason is because the battery drains quickly. I use my phone for traveling send and receiving documents,emails ect.... so i guess how you use your phone will determine your battery life. Im going to order a new battery soon maybe it will make a difference.Im glad I  got this device at this price and it works just the same as the devices sold in the T-Mobile stores that are priced way more!

It was a simple flip phone until 2 years later, I had a contract, and in my junior year I upgraded to the Galaxy Samsung S2 AT&T; version model SPH-D710. Once I received this phone, it blew my mind on just how fantastic this phone is. For consumers looking for a phone to invest that is reliable, efficient, and easy-to-use, then look no further for this could be the perfect phone.The Samsung Galaxy contains a HD quality camera on the front and the back of the phone with flash. The front side has 2.0 MP or mega pixels, while the back is 8.0 MP. Which means the more MP you have the better quality of pictures you can take. There are options to add different types of effects to edit and change the pictures. It also has a video camera that you can record on both sides of the phone. Now with great quality of pictures and videos, it can stream HD 720P (particles) videos on the phone and has a great speaker. The speaker is on the back of the phone in which you can watch videos and music without headphones. It's a very convenient feature and comes in handy when needed. I think, personally, the best feature of this phone is that the screen uses Gorilla Glass in which it is tough as nails and still smooth like a baby's bottom. Compared to other phones, Galaxy in general have one of the toughest screens so when it drops there is a high chance that it would not break. I personally had my own shares of dropping my phone and yet no scratch on the screen. Now as amazing as this phone can be, it still has problems.  The camera has a slight delay when taking pictures, which means that if the camera moves when taking the pictures it will come out a bit blurry or the angle wouldn't be right.  The video cannot zoom in when recording in full HD but can lower the resolution to record. The front side of the phone cannot zoom in either even if the quality of the video is lowered. The audio can crack a bit when the phone call is set too speaker.Galaxy phones are more lenient when it comes to apps so it can download third party apps. The range from free music to video game emulators (emulators are ways to play old/current videogames mostly handhelds). They also provide an app store to buy games or music just like the app store from Apple. With all those apps open there is an easier way to close those apps by checking the active applications and close them all. Checking the active applications it shows what apps are draining the most battery. It is a great way to conserve battery life. The crazy thing about checking the active applications that it also shows other things such as: downloads, RAM (random access memory) system storage, and downloads. Also while in the active applications, uninstalling could never be so easy. Simply go to downloads and bam all applications that have downloaded could be easily uninstalled. About third party apps, they tend to have a lot of ads that pop up around the apps. It can cause problems when playing games and accidentally touching the ads thus taking to some random website.In conclusion, this phone is just pure awesomeness. It does what a smart phone is expected which is to deliver. It is efficient by enabling to close down programs that are not being used extended battery life. It is reliable enough that it will not break just because it fell from five feet. Anybody could use it due to where apps and settings are located.

It developed a \"sticky key.\"  This is a common problem on these phones where the device refuses to fully power on. I easily fixed that by opening it up and squeezing various areas of the inner (connected to the motherboard not the external button cover) power button.  I upgraded to it from a Huawei Mytouch (a newer but very low end smartphone). The huawei is much faster and the construction is much better with the Huawei's back being soft touch, smaller and much more comfortable to hold, and the back is much more resilient ( this Galaxy's back cover is made from hard plastic that chips when you've dropped it).Also the silver border paint has peeled and the phone just hasn't aged well. Compared to the Huawei, this one was much faster- when it was working. It also allowed me to use much more new apps. Though I found the new android OS to be more confusing to use. Every day there is constant freezing up of applications. Browser, Tapatalk, kik among others. Sometimes I can't even answer calls ie. I swipe and there is animation depicted but the call keeps ringing. Battery life on all smart phones is atrocious as expected. Every night battery is low. I'm not quite sure smart phones are even worth the trouble when dumb phones are much more reliable and I have a laptop for serious usage anyways.

I think I liked my MyTouch4 better", "Author": "Ann in Amherst", "ReviewID": "R1WXNQ8A43P5DT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I upgraded from my MyTouch4G (T-Mobile) because I wanted faster 4G performance.  In that, I have not been disappointed.The phone and its features basically work the way they are supposed to, with one glaring exception: Bluetooth headsets don't seem to work well with the phone's VoiceTalk program. I have tried three different headsets, including a Samsung Galaxy HM3300, and none of them is truly hands free as advertised. For example, you place a call, you hear the phone ringing -- and when the other party answers, it's not on your headset, even though the phone screen is marked for headset. So you have to touch the headset button (turning it \"off\") and turn it on again, and then it's okay. When I first put the headset on, I get a happy \"Connected\" message, but when I actually have to place a call, I can press the headset Call button, get the right signal from the phone -- and then nothing happens. Although sometimes it \"catches\" on the 2nd or 3rd try, there are times I keep doing it over and over (just to see what happens), and it NEVER opens VoiceDial t. When I watch the screen while doing all of this, the screen never changes to the Voice Talk screen, even though the clicks and squeaks in the headset signal that it is trying to do so. Other times, it will come on and dial the last number dialed, even though that was not the way I was operating the Call button on the headset. There is not much of a workaround for this, alas. A phone touted this highly shouldn't be this difficult to use a Bluetooth with. I never had any problems with the MyTouch 4G.One other more minor inconvenience: the Calendar for creating new events is not accessible from the list-style agenda widget, which means that, after checking my agenda list, I have to go somewhere else to add a new event. Bummer.I am also disappointed in the camera. It's great for closer up shots, but farther away shots -- even those in a large room -- look dark, even with a flash. I went with Samsung because of the reputed quality of the camera.Things I do like are the increased number of Home screens and the choices available when canceling an event that has been entered as a repeating event (this event only, this and all future events, this and all other events), which is nice for dealing with seasonal, repeating events such as choral rehearsals.  I also like the wide variety of available settings, which allows for a pretty high degree of personalization.If anyone has a good workaround for the Bluetooth headset problems, I would love to hear about it, and would gladly revise my review upwards.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Alexander Douglas", "ReviewID": "ROPTAD6XOELBB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice phone for the price.

I have an S2 purchased directly from T-Mobile that I absolutely love. Great little phone. My issue with this specific purchase has to do with the seller.*The first phone purchased through Ross Cellular died after 2 weeks of use. Amazon returned it for my mom no questions asked. The replacement purchased again through Ross completely died after trying to update the operating system through Samsung Kies. After trying to figure out the problem with Samsung directly they let me know that the phone I had was NOT a U.S. device. It was a SAM-T989, when it states it to be a SGH-T989. Both came without the updated operating system. I know this only because I have my own S2 I bought directly through t-mobile and it's like night and day, the difference. There was not a factory battery nor was there a USB capable plug-in. My mother told me the battery lasted maybe 8 hours, and this was with minimal use while she was at work.The seller contacted me to let me know they were making steps to change the problem, that it was an issue with their vendor but I did not want to remove the review on their page, as they requested, because I saw there were other similar reviews placed and I will never know unless I purchased another phone from them if this was a true statement made by them.
