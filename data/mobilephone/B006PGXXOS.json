{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone, for the first 11 months. Then horrid.", "Author": "Mr. H", "ReviewID": "R1Z7P2EBDK6TB2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Edited:I will leave the review as originally posted, but add this addendum. I do not recommend this phone at any price. It was a great phone for the first 9 months. Then it simply began falling apart. Tremendously unstable, and then at the 13 month mark it simply quit working. Just died.The phone began having tremendous stability problems that were not resolved with a full wipe and restore towards the end of the warrant life. I had nothing but increasing frustration with the microphone on the phone. Callers reported huge issues hearing me. The smallest piece of dust and usual day to day dirt could clog the microphone making it unusable except in speakerphone mode. It froze up all the time during calls, answering calls.Last week, it spontaneously rebooted and restarted into the recovery mode. The down volume key was apparently stuck, causing this. The phone could not be fixed. It simply quit working.Avoid this phone at all costs.Original review follows:---You cannot find a better phone for the money. Period. Add a good value on the Boost service and you'll never look back to whatever overpriced plan you came from. I don't know why most people never think of prepaid. I used to pay well north of $120/month back in the day for unlimited service. This phone is fantastic. It's thin, solidly built, very brisk to respond, and absolutely brimming with storage space.-=Things I like=-It's got a nice, bright 4.3\" diagonal screen. The touch screen is both durable and sensitive. I've used it with rubber gloves on and never had it fail to pick up a touch.It comes with a 1ghz processor which is more than adequate for anything I've run. Full screen Netflix, no problem. About 95% of the games in the Android Market, no problem.The operating system isn't too cluttered with a bunch of bloatware. It ships with 2.3.5 of the Android OS. You get some, but not a lot. There's Documents to Go, something called MobileID, and that's pretty much it. That leaves a healthy 2.25+ gig available onboard for application storage. It also includes a 2gb micro SD card as well, but I have yet to put a single application on the card itself. I have about 150 apps installed and there's still 1.8 gig remaining internally.Battery life is decent. No better or worse than any other Android phone. 10-12 hours of normal use for me -- email, bit of web, few calls, etc..Price is quite good. I paid over $200 about a month ago and was happy for what I got then.One Click Root available for the phone. I updated my phone to the latest firmware (B08) which you can do over the air on the phone for some stability improvements. Then I downloaded the one click root app and had root in about 5 minutes. Absolutely slick. It's amazing what you can do with the Android OS when you have root. Free WiFi tethering for instance. Undetectable tracking programs if you lose your phone. Ad-Block. Being able to delete the preinstalled bloatware. And that's just the start.-=Things that are okay=-The camera. It's pretty lackluster. They claim 5 MP. Yeah, it has 5 MP. But it's not a good quality 5MP. You get a grainy picture you can enlarge more at 5MP. Shutter time is pretty unimpressive too. It takes a few seconds after you hit the button to focus and capture. It has autofocus, so those barcode scanner apps WILL work on it. The AF is slow. The camera LED is absolutely AWFUL. It creates such a ghastly tint on pictures, it's not even worth using.Very few aftermarket apps and accessories. I found an case that was okay. It's a rubber case to protect against short drops.-=Things that are absolute fail=-Ringer volume is far too quiet as a stock phone. Even turned up all the way, it's still VERY quiet compared to some phones. I found an equalizer program in the market and used that to boost the volume and also amplified my ring tones as well.No OEM or aftermarket batteries. The way smartphones chew through batteries, it's only a matter of time until you kill the battery. What do you do then? I guess throw the phone away.XT9 text input. It's junk. I hated it. Swype is 100 times better. XT9 looks cheap, feels cheap, doesn't work, and just generally is an awful implementation. I use a free trace type app from the Android market to replace the phone.Dialer itself is very clunky and irritating to use. Again, found a third-party market app to replace the stock dialer.MobileID -- Boost and Sprint tout this MobileID program on these phones. It's basically a skinning app. They have all of 4 to chose from and they're all horrid. All it does is install some crazy launcher, a bunch of apps you don't need, hideous ringtones, and then add some wallpaper you wish you never saw. After I rooted the phone, this was the first thing I deleted.---Despite the ho hum parts, it is a fantastic phone for the money. Good solid feel, reliable, and speedy with lots of storage to play with.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price", "Author": "DD \"tudorose\"", "ReviewID": "R2N4YC9GL6HFNL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to own a smartphone, but I didn't want to be locked into a 2-year contract which would cost hundreds to cancel. This ZTE phone through Boost Mobile fit the bill perfectly, and the bang for your buck comes with the \"shrinking bill.\" When you pay your monthly bill on time for 18 months your bill goes down $15.00 per month. You can't beat that. The phone is the perfect size and is feature rich. The screen is nice and bright---perfect for playing games and surfing the web, and the colors are vibrant. The reader has a \"night reading\" feature which changes the screen to black and the letters to white and you can enlarge the font.  That is so much easier on the eyes, especially when I'm reading on the bus and the lighting is dim at best. Actually there are some other great features with the reader function. Perhaps all smartphones have the same features. I just know that I'm impressed that I can actually enjoy reading on a 4.3 inch screen. I've had no problems with the phone other than the sound quality of calls being a little fuzzy. I have to admit that I use the phone for reading, playing games, and surfing the web far more than I use it to make calls. Battery life isn't great as is the case with almost all smartphones, however, you can use the phone while it's charging. The downside to that is the cord isn't very long so you have to be close to an outlet. I'm really pleased with this surprisingly affordable phone and it's a plus to have the Android Gingerbread operating system in place. It's fast and easy to use. The price on Amazon is pretty good but I got a better deal buying the phone from Boost. I would recommend this phone to first-time smartphone buyers and anyone who wants a great 3G, Wi-Fi enabled smartphone with no contract. That's the best feature of all. I can't speak to the longevity of the phone---it's too early to tell if this phone will last for the long haul. But I can definately say so far, so good. One last comment: I found a package on Amazon which included a nice, sturdy phone case with a magnetic closure, a car charger, USB cable, and an electric outlet charger for a very reasonable price. I like having the extra chargers and the USB cable, which was not included with the phone, is a plus when I want to download from my PC.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Android addition to Boost Mobile Prepaid Plan", "Author": "Mr. Richard Martinez \"Rich\"", "ReviewID": "R2WPNLARNYCNFX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After experiencing problems with my boost mobile Blackberry model 8330 I decided to upgrade. Circulation of the ZTE Android is limited so I couldn't locate one through a retailer. However, I ordered it direct through Boost Mobile and it arrive in three days.

Further, I prefer prepaid to contracts service because it makes good financial sense although I can certainly afford the either. I have had a long standing relationship with several contract phone carriers although Boost Mobile remains the best prepaid phone service. Perhaps, a wider variety of cases will become available over the upcoming months. I rated the phone with 5-stars despite the challenges associated with finding a better after-market quality case.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "ZTE Warp (N860) --- Boost Mobile", "Author": "Knight of Ni", "ReviewID": "R1JK1M569MLVQZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(The main attraction of this phone is actually the service provider, Boost Mobile.  While the cost, terms, and quality of Boost Mobile's voice and data services would greatly influence a user's experience with this phone, those are outside of the scope of this review.)I was initially hesitant to buy the ZTE Warp, because of my lack of familiarity with the manufacturer. Don't let that stop you - I think this is the best value in Boost Mobile's current smartphone lineup.The phone comes with a wall charger adapter with a single USB female plug, a USB A male-to-micro B charging/data cable, a brief \"Getting Started\" manual, a more detailed user manual, an \"Activation Kit\" manual, and a Qmadix screen protector.Since this device is a phone, I should first mention that sound quality for voice calls is very good.  I haven't had any problems with reception, but Sprint has good coverage where I live.The ZTE Warp has a 1 GHz single-core CPU, which is far from cutting edge, but it is more than adequate.  There is no lag at all when scrolling or transitioning between screens, even using fancy effects with a launcher app.  Menus and apps load and run very quickly.The screen is responsive to tactile input, with no problems tapping, sliding, or moving icons around.  The screen is large, and looks nice.  It is obviously not in the same league as a Super AMOLED or Retina Display, but this is not an issue unless you are doing a side by side comparison.I have large fingers, and find it easy to type with the phone in landscape orientation, somewhat less easy in portrait.  XT9's auto-correct feature sometimes changes words from what I've already manually (and correctly) typed to something else.  This isn't sufficiently annoying to prompt me to install an alternative, yet.There is very little bloatware.  There is MobileID, which is a useless theme/skin app. (GO Launcher EX, LauncherPro, and ADWLauncher are far superior.)  There is also BoostZone, which provides easy access to your account information and self-help guides, but doesn't do anything you couldn't already accomplish by browsing Boost Mobile's web site.  These apps cannot be deleted without rooting the phone.  Other than that, you get the stock 2.3.5 Android (Gingerbread) OS, and can customize it to your liking.As mentioned in another Amazon review, rooting the phone is easily done via One Click Root.  Doing so voids the warranty, and so I do not plan to root until it expires.  There are tutorials on Android user forums and videos that explain the process, if you want to do it.Though I don't expect any camera phone to perform as well as a dedicated digital camera, I have to say that the ZTE Warp's pictures and video are, to put it kindly, suboptimal.  The autofocus takes a while to lock on, so there is typically about a two second lag between pressing the camera button and acquiring the image.  My phone's LED flash does not result in the \"ghastly tint\" described in another Amazon review, but there is some normal variation in tint between individual LEDs.  I was fortunate enough to get a neutral tinted LED, and the other reviewer probably got a blue or green tinted one.  I do not take pictures with the phone frequently, and so I haven't bothered to install an app to improve camera performance (though I've read that HDR Camera for Android is good).The bezel of the camera and flash sticks out a bit from the back of the camera, so it is possible to scratch the lens by setting the phone down on its back.  However, most users will use some sort of case, cover, or skin to protect the phone, which should counteract this design quirk.I have not figured out how to turn on the flash LED for illumination while taking a video.  After reading the user manual, fiddling with the phone, perusing a few Android user forums, and reading and watching numerous reviews, I have come to the conclusion that it can't be done.  If anybody knows how to do it, please post or comment!  Also, I haven't found a (free) flashlight app that can access and control the phone's LED.  However, I am a \"flashaholic\", and I always carry at least one \"real\" flashlight, so I consider this to be a minor disappointment rather than a flaw.Other reviewers have commented that the ringer and speaker are not loud enough.  In my opinion, the volume is adequate, but individual users' needs, sonic environments, and hearing acuity will vary.  The speaker might be inadequate to listen to music, but I think most users would do so with headphones.  The headphone jack is 3.5 mm, by the way.I have not experienced any lockups or reboots yet.  When I bought the phone, I charged the battery, activated it, and applied all of the updates (PRL, Profile, \"ZTE Software\", and firmware) before doing anything else with it.  The phone requires the battery to be charged to a certain level (I think it was 50% - sorry, I don't remember what the prompt said) before downloading and applying all of the updates.  The update menu is found via Settings --> About Phone --> System Updates.  Alternatively, there is an application (Boost Mobile Warp Online Upgrade Tool.exe) for your PC that can be downloaded from zteusa.com to apply updates and to use the phone's \"USB debugging\" mode.  This is done by connecting your PC and the phone with a USB A-to-micro B cable and running the program (phone drivers need to be installed on the PC).  There is a manual for the software on ZTE's website (Boost Mobile Warp Online Upgrade Tool Introduction.pdf), which is written in \"Zhonglish\" (\"Chinglish\"?).  Maybe I'm paranoid, but I don't want to install Chinese software on my PC, so I don't plan to do this. I concede that I am using a Chinese-made phone with access to my Google account and personal contacts, but I don't access bank or brokerage accounts with my phone, nor do I make any purchases other than apps.I have not experienced any force closes yet, but these are probably inevitable unless you somehow manage to install apps that do not conflict with any others (good luck with that).I have not had any problems with using Wi-Fi.  Bluetooth works well with my car's audio system for calls.  I don't use Bluetooth for music in my car, so I can't comment on that feature.  GPS with Google Maps and the stock navigation software doesn't work quite as well as a dedicated GPS device, but it's good enough.Battery life is adequate.  I managed to burn through about 70% of the battery in several hours by downloading and trying out over a dozen GO Launcher EX themes, and letting my kids slingshot enraged birds at pigs and slash fruit in a ninja dojo.  My typical daily usage (several calls, checking email, some web browsing, 15-30 minutes of casual gaming) gets me about 12-14 hours before draining the battery to 10-15%.  Your results will vary.  There are apps that claim to prolong battery life (e.g. Juice Defender), but I use the stock Android widget to turn off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and 3G manually when they are not needed, and I find that this suffices.I cannot find any retailer that sells replacement batteries for the ZTE Warp.  There are third party external backup batteries available, but I would prefer a replacement for the internal battery.  ZTE customer support recommended contacting Boost Mobile, but Boost doesn't have any in stock currently.  Mugen Power does not intend to make extended batteries for the Warp, according to an email dated 28 Nov 2011 from Mugen posted on androidforums.com.  The unavailability of batteries is a potential drawback, but I would assume that they will become available as the number of Warp users increases.There are a number of accessories currently available for the ZTE Warp, which were apparently difficult to find a few months ago.  I bought an Amzer screen protector and Amzer hard case from Amazon.  I found the Warp's screen to be a bit too reflective for my liking, but the screen protector fixed that.If you are satisfied with 3G data speed, don't use apps that require a cutting-edge CPU and/or a dedicated graphics processor, and won't be disappointed if you don't have Ice Cream Sandwich installed on your phone, the ZTE Warp is a great choice.This review tends to focus on the Warp's shortcomings.  However, I wrote it bearing in mind that certain trade-offs must be accepted when value is a higher priority than high-end performance, and thought it would be helpful to highlight those trade-offs.  In that light, I would give the Warp a rating of 4.5 stars based upon its performance for its price.  Since none of my quibbles are major issues (with the possible exception of the camera), and I am generally satisfied with Boost Mobile's pricing and service, in my opinion the Warp's rating deserves rounding up to 5 stars.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great screen, buggy system, economical & reliable carrier", "Author": "cinephiliagal", "ReviewID": "R1Y3TY11PHCAW4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "FIRST, about Boost. (If you want to read about the phone, skip ahead.)I've been with Boost for a few years now. I'm totally happy with them as a carrier. I got sick and tired of paying $95-150/month for my smart phone bills (because contract cell carrier smart phone plans did not include unlimited minutes AND unlimited texting WITH unlimited data -- so I was constantly paying overage for texting and talking too much). So a few years ago I switched to Boost. Boost uses the Sprint network, and I haven't had any problems with it (depending on the phone used). It was TOTALLY worth the $45-100/month I SAVED being on Boost. And now that Boost and other prepaid carriers are offering smartphones and Androids, I will NEVER go back to a contract mobile phone. Never. There is no reason to.Every now and then, I pick up and try other prepaid phones. I'm not impressed. Net10, Tracfone, Straight Talk, and Virgin Mobile all \"dumb down\" their phones by disabling factory default features (such as ability to use phone as a wifi hotspot). Straight Talk is by far the worst for dumbing down phones (they disable *tons* of features).Boost also removes some features (like the ability to use the phone as a wifi hotspot, damnit!). But on Boost smartphones, you can get around that with some apps (such as PDAnet). You CAN'T get around it on any of the Net10, Tracfone, or Straight Talk phones I've tried. I'm not sure if that's because they disable those services in the phone's hardware, in the phone's software, or on the cell network (by using the cell's unique address/ID to block certain services).Boost also doesn't cap data service and then slow it down when you reach the cap. All other prepaid carriers (and most contract carriers) do this. I thought that was because Boost is a prepaid arm of Sprint, who also don't cap data service. But then, Virgin Mobile is also a Sprint subsidiary, and data service is capped on Virgin Mobile phones (once you reach the cap, your data service slooooowwwws dooowwwwwnnn...).It's true, it's hard to get a human with Boost's customer service... but that's true of all the prepaid carriers, WORST with Straight Talk. For many of these prepaid carriers, you get heavily accented \"English-speaking\" customer service or tech support in India or the Philippines. Their English can be hard to understand. Never had that issue with the major carriers like AT&T; and US Cellular, but I never called or needed their customer service often enough for it to be worth the extra $45-100 I paid monthly!Boost also offers bill shrinkage. For every 6 months you pay your bill on time, they shrink the bill by $5. For regular phone users (who pay the $50 unlimited talk/text/web), you can shrink your bill down to as low as $35/month. For Android users, who start at $55/month for unlimited talk/text/data, you can shrink your bill down to $40/month. For Blackberry users, who start at $60/month for unlimited talk/text/data (by FAR the cheapest Blackberry service available ANYWHERE in the US), your bills can shrink down to $45/month, as I understand it. Basically, whatever plan you're on, if you pay your bill on time for 18 months, your bill will shrink $15/month ($5 every 6 months).So, I'm very satisfied with Boost. I've been on Verizon, AT&T;, T-Mobile and US Cellular. They are not worth the cost. I've also tried other prepaid carriers: Net10, Tracfone, Straight Talk, and Virgin Mobile. Not impressed, especially because they dumb down/disable features on their phones and cap data speeds. Boost doesn't cap data/speeds, rarely disables features/dumbs down (if/when they do, you can just find an app, or root the phone, to get around it). Boost also has WAY LESS bloatware than all the other prepaid carriers, and less than many contract carriers. So I don't see myself leaving Boost any time soon.I realize this sounds like a Boost commercial. I don't mean it to. It's just that I've tried almost all other contract and prepaid carriers and felt like I was getting ripped off. I don't feel that way with Boost. They really seem to have the best combination of monthly cost for unlimited talk/text/data, phone/smartphone selection, reliable network service, rarely disabling phone features, and rewarding customer loyalty. Boost is not perfect (customer service; other carriers obviously have many more phones to choose from). But Boost is better than every other carrier I've tried, and I simply refuse to go back to paying $95-150+/month just so I can get the latest/greatest mobile phone... especially when Boost now offers so many Android phones.Now about THE PHONE:The ZTE Warp is a decent Android phone. It is not great. It is not total crap, either. It gets about average battery life.Not using \"location service\" (GPS) increases your battery life. So does turning off wifi until/unless you need it. In fact, if you have to be somewhere that makes cell reception nearly impossible (like, deep within a hospital near shielded areas, like Radiology...), it's best to put your phone in Airplane mode so it will stop *trying* to connect to the network or Wifi, which uses up juice.Pros:Screen is large, hi-res; good for watching vide/reading ebooks/editing docsMicroSD card up to 32G (download TV shows from your PC and watch them!)Corning Gorilla Glass screen, not easily scratched like most touch-screensCons:Buggy system softwareToo-soft haptic feedbackPoor reception (unrelated to network)Mediocre camera and lousy, low-res videoCrappy native browser*Lousy input XT9 and Android keyboards*Quiet (too quiet) ring tones*Native MP3 player sucks*Native video player sucks (and only plays 3GP video)*Sucks up battery if using GPS/Wifi/3G/MP3 player/watching video*One issue I noticed is, if you are outside and it's chilly or downright cold (40s F or below) and you are not wearing gloves, it's nearly impossible to use the touchscreen with your naked fingers, frustratingly difficult even with gloved fingertips. This may be a result of the cold outside temperature affecting the touch screen. Or it may be the cold affecting the Gorilla Glass screen; I'm not sure.*All asterisked issues can be fixed or ameliorated with third party Android apps. I have found freeware apps to solve or work around all of these issues. Opera Mini or Boat Mini browsers are better than the native one. A ring-tone or equalizer app can fix the too-quiet ring tone issue. A freeware music/MP3 player fixes the music issue (I use the Amazon MP3 player, though it's not great, either). MoboPlayer and QQPlayer both will play AVI and WMV files, so all I have to do is load up my microSD card with my favorite TV shows, and I can watch them.An app killer that automatically kills apps/services can help with the battery issues (I use Advanced Task Killer). However, if you're going to watch a lot of video or plan to listen to MP3s for a few hours while doing something else, you'd better have the charger nearby.There is no solution to the lousy camera, low-res video that it takes, or the buggy system software, as far as I can tell. I'd rather have a better 3 MP camera that can take higher res video than this phones lousy 5 MP camera and low-res video recording.Also, this phone does some weird stuff if you enable Wifi but then spend time in an area with no Wifi. For some reason, even when you have 3G network capability and full bars for the cell signal, if Wifi is enabled but there's no Wifi network available near you, the 3G often won't work for data. Any Internet service (such as browsers, weather apps, Gas Buddy) will say they can't connect to the network. Disabling Wifi and re-enabling it does not work to solve this.To fix this problem, you have to turn the phone off and then back on, or put the phone in \"Airplane mode\" for a few seconds (which has it's own issues, see below)This Wifi-makes-cell-service-stop-working problem may be an Android problem, rather than a ZTE Warp-specific problem; I have noticed a similar problem on my Virgin Mobile LG Optimus Slider Android phone. And I've heard of other Android users having this problem intermittently.Then there is the Airplane mode bug. When you put the ZTE Warp in Airplane mode in the \"Wireless & networks\" settings, if you exit the \"Wireless & networks\" settings screen, when you go back to the Wireless & networks setting screen, you can't turn Airplane mode back off. When you exit the settings, and try to go back, the box for Airplane mode is UNchecked, even though you are IN Airplane mode (and can't access the cell network or use Wifi or GPS). With the box unchecked, there is no way to turn Airplane mode back *off* once you leave the \"Wireless & networks\" settings screen. If you check the box, it just turns Airplane mode \"back on,\" like you would expect it to. It does not \"toggle\" the way it's supposed to.The only solution to this that I've found is to turn the phone off and then turn it back on, then go back to \"Wireless & networks\" settings *again*. After restarting the phone, the Airplane mode box IS checked (BECAUSE you *are* in Airplane mode)... so you can finally uncheck it.The desktop does not flip into landscape mode when you flip the phone into landscape mode for any other use (such as, to make the virtual keyboard bigger). I was told by a Radio Shack employee and also by a Boost Mobile employee that that is normal for Android phones without physical QWERTY keyboards. This seems stupid to me. It may not be a bug, but it does seem like poor design, to me...The lousy cell reception of this phone seems to have no cure, except standing close to windows or going outside. I have a prepaid Virgin Mobile Android LG Optimus Slider, which I use for tenants and contractors/repair services for the building I temporarily manage (long story). Virgin Mobile uses the Sprint network, which is what Boost also uses.Unfortunately, many times people who know both my Boost and Virgin Mobile phone numbers (like my boyfriend) will call both my phones, starting with the Boost phone first (it is my main personal phone). Although I will have both phones on me or near me, the ZTE Warp won't ring -- and often won't even list the missed call!Then when my bf calls my Virgin Mobile LG Android phone, it rings right away. If he left voicemail on the Boost phone first, the ZTE Warp will suddenly wake up a few minutes later and tell me I have voicemail, although it does not list the missed call. Since both phones use the Sprint network, and I have both with me in the same place, it can't be the network that's causing the problem. It has to be the phone's poor reception.Also, my previous Boost phone was a Sanyo Incognito (yes, I was without a smartphone for a time, horrors!), and it rarely had these reception problems, even in the same rooms and on the same floors in the same building. Maybe the Corning Gorilla Glass touch screen on this ZTE Warp interferes with cell reception? IDK, but it's really annoying, especially when you miss calls you wanted to get.To sum up:If the ZTE Warp is your first Android phone, and/or your first smartphone, and/or your first experience with Boost, you will probably be very happy with the ZTE Warp (and Boost).If you like to read books/fiction on your phone, or you want to watch a lot of video, you will probably *love* the ZTE Warp, for it's big beautiful (and rugged) screen. It has the biggest screen of all the Androids on offer from Boost, and a bigger screen than many Android phones from contract cell carriers.If you plan to watch a lot of movies/TV on this phone, you will love the big, beautiful, hi-res screen even more AFTER you install a better video app, such as Moboplayer or QQPlayer (as of this writing, both are available as freeware from the Google Play app store). The native video app -- as with most smartphones -- can only play 3GP video. That means all your favorite movies or TV shows that you want to transfer from your PC to your phone, must be converted to 3GP video first. That's a huge pain the butt, so installing an app that can natively play WMV, MP4, or AVI files will definitely make your life and video viewing much easier!If you tend to drop your phone a lot or often stick it in places where it can get scratched (like in a purse or pocket next to your house keys), you will appreciate the way the Corning Gorilla Glass screen doesn't scratch up like most other phone screens do.If this is not your first Android phone, or not your first smartphone, though, you may not be happy. The buggy system, the lousy cell reception, the too-quiet ring tones, the too-soft haptic feedback (maybe that's a result of the Gorilla Glass, too; idk), Airplane mode that you can't turn off unless you turn the phone off and then back on, Wifi making 3G stop working... these are all minor problems, but together they add up to pretty damn annoying, for me.No mobile phone is perfect. Usually you have to tolerate some annoying crap in order to get the features you want. The ZTE Warp has a few Pros and a lot of Cons. If you don't value the Pros very much, you probably will not want to tolerate the Cons, and you'll probably  be better off looking at a different Android phones from Boost.I'm planning to switch to Boost's Samsung Transform Ultra. I don't regret \"my time with the ZTE Warp\" but the annoyances have started to build up and annoy me. Also, I just prefer a physical QWERTY keyboard. I go used to it on my old (very over-priced) Blackberry (on US Cellular, before I switched to Boost). I'm old school, I guess.

Phone calls are good on this phone and speaker phone is very good. The ringer volume is very loud...so missing a phone call due to quiet ringtone isn't an option. The camera is very good...I was actually surprised how well this phone took pictures...it does take awhile for the phone to actually take a picture....taking pictures of kids is kind of hard...it does have a flash and auto focus...the flash is pretty pointless...all together the camera feature on this phone is good....The problem I am having so far with this phone is the battery life...Yes, all smartphones are going to have somewhat crappy battery life...but man...the batter isn't the greatest on this phone. listening to music on this phone is great...There is a lot of phone internal memory approx 2.5GB. 4.5 with the mini sd card that comes with the phone. Thus far, I haven't had any problems with this phone...For the price I would definitely suggest this phone. If you are a little leary about the brand ZTE, (which I was to begin with) you could go with boost mobiles newest phone LG Marquee...but that price tag is hefty.

Prior to purchasing the ZTE Warp, I had never heard of ZTE before, so I did a lot of background checking on this phone.  What I found were mixed reviews, but the consensus was that the ZTE Warp was a good phone for the money paid.  What drew us to this phone was the screen size and not being under a contract anymore.  Once we got the phones, we had some problems that neither of us could deal with anymore.  Enough so that we returned the phones and renewed a contract...What I liked:-Large screen size-Fast, smooth transitions between screens-Apps loaded fastWhat I did not like:-For some reason, joining contacts was impossible for this phone... and I tried to find a way.-Multiple freezes per day-Multiple crash/reboots per day-This is more of a Boost mobile issue, but despite the customer service being very helpful, they were difficult to understand as their operators had limited English or thick accents.The freezing up of the phone happened 3-4 times per day (on a good day) and on the last day I had the phone, it happened 10 times.  Each time I would need to remove the battery and restart the phone.  This was made horribly annoying by the fact that I had a case on the phone that was almost impossible to remove without injuring yourself.  The phone freezing up seemed to happen most during use of apps.The phone crashing and rebooting happened frequently as well.  Not as much as the phone freezing up, but I'd say on average 2-5 times per day the phone would reboot.  There did not seem to be any pattern to the reboot either.  At times the phone was just sitting out in the open, at other times, was during use or even phone calls.I very rarely return items that I purchase, and I tend to find a way to make something work, especially with electronics.  I'm not the most tech savvy, but I can research something enough and find out how to get something to work properly enough.  I just was not able to do that with this phone.

At first, I was set on buying teh LG OPtimus S, but after the purchase and the knowledge of it being a rooted phone from Sprint, I had to make yet another decision as to what next.  I decided that cost-wise, the ZTE Warp wouild fit my budget well, I was never more wrong before as, after taxes, it came to $264.  The purchase was made in March of this year and I was pleased with it for about two weeks, thats all, two weeks.  It was then that I began to experience a wealth of bugs and serious issues that I'd never seen before.  I consulted the place where i bought it and got nowhere as to how they could be fixed.  So, after about two months of remaining as optimistic as I could, I started to explore the return policies of A)the manufacturer and B)the service provider and C)the retailer.  Starting with the last, reltailer said they offered a 30-day return service after which I would have to go to BOOST or ZTE...cancelled C) out.  Next, I inquired online at boostmobile.com and discovered that since i didn't purchase on their website, i couldn't be helped.  Lastly and the most interestingly, ZTE explained i would need to send to repair facility in TX so I printed their label and boxed up to ship out.  ABout 12 days later, it was returned to me all alone in a box with no sufficient packing materials!!!There was now report, log or repairs, or evaluation summary to reference for my review.  I was very alarmed by that and contacted ZTE once again to ahich i was told they dont include any type of summary.  SO, i am closely examining my newly repaired Warp and sure enough, the same issues and they are as follows:1) randoms restarts2) excessive heat generated when using more than one app3) call quality is very sub-par4) the speakerphone feature is basically non-existent5)  earpiece volume is unacceptably low6)  overall performance is low-budget/entry level Mickey Mouse caliberSo they basically held my phone and did who knows to it...all i know is that i am very upset with ZTE and their scamming US customers with poor product.  I emailed ZTE reps and had to demand in large font bolded typeface repeatedly, that my handset be replaced and after three days of the, and I quote ZTE rep's exact language here \"The Higher Authorities\" would review and offer a resolve.After the three days, I received an email saying that they would, replace but only the handset itself not the battery or back cover.  What if the battery could be adding to the issues present?  I guess it's my responsibility to solve that one cuz i am sure as hell not going to attempt to demand anything further from ZTE.LOng and Horrible story short here folks, STEER WAY CLEAR OF THIS PHONE...THE FACT THAT IT WAS DESIGNED WITH ONLY A SINGLE CORE, LOW POWERED PROCCESSOR STRAINING TO POWER THE HUGE 4.2\" SCREEN IS OF MUCH QUESTIONABILITY!!!!!

The only way to fix this issue is to root the phone and manually clear the dalvik cache once a week. The phone will also randomly reboot itself (with loud boot sound) at the most inopportune times while at work when your phone is on silent.

Whut got me to really Purchase da phone is Screen Size. Its beautiful to have such a big screen after having the BB small screen. Second, Android OS is Great! If u cant afford Apple this is definitely the route u want to go!! Third, it comes with flash for camera and the Size of the Internal Memory (jus about 3 gigs!!). U get a 32 gig mini sd card and ur freakin Straight!!! Now, the cons. I had a problem wit the constant Force Closes which were gettin sooo Annoying i was just about to Return da damn thing! But being new to Android i did some Research and found out that u need to make use of the Task Manager! At first i got one thru the Android Market but found out the one that comes wit the phone is just as good. U need to stay on top of the \"Running Apps\" So they don't freeze the phone up. After that, I'm Off and Running ;-)! I only download apps that i need, some r for fun but im careful and stay within the Android Market apps. So for anyone having trouble wit their phone or thinking of buying this or any other phone for that matter, do ur Homework and Research And you'll Be A-OK ;-) U Wont Regret It! (I dont).

Originally was going to get a Samsung Galaxy, and had had two of these since August, I decided I wanted a slight upgrade to something that wasn't all the time heating up and turning itsself off and frying out every time I turned around. I know I am pretty hard on phones but just didn't like the Galaxy at all in the end so we actually went and got this phone. It actually came 2 days earlier than what they were projecting which was very good in my books, especially with the free shipping. When I transferred my old boost phone number over to the new phone, I was really not pleased that my shrinkage account was potentially going to no longer be in effect, due to the fact that in less than three months now, it will be lowered to $40. We did get this cleared up so all is well.So far, I have been very happy due to the fast download times, as well as there is virtually hardly any bloatware to speak of compared to my old Boost Phone. Calls are super clear, I have a much bigger screen and the audio is very top quality. I'm also pretty happy with the battery life so far, and don't have to charge nearly as much as I did my old Samsung. It doesn't overheat like my other two phones, and overall this is a pretty great little piece of equipment.My Cons:When I go to charge this phone overnight, it tends to want to shut itself off from time to time.

I however, did not have this problem. We are still not sure how to fix it, or what caused it.The sound is on the low side. I do have to admit I hate the keyboard.

This is annoying when you are trying to rush a text message or type out anything fast.I wish I was a \"tech geek\" to give more inside on this bad boy, but I cant. Everything works great aside from the minor complication we have yet to come across anything else. They do have a short battery life. Keep that in mind when you purchase. I get about 2 days leaving it on.I do ask that if your not \"Android Smart\" to ask around for must have apps. Lets see here... like a virus app is a must have. It kills off everything that would cause a virus in the phone. A task manager is another. This will kill down the apps running. So that you don't have them running, and your phone goes dead faster.

I haven't had any real SERVICE problems. Many of the issues I've had were with the phones I bought.I originally had a samsung replenish. I can't say much good about that, it had poor memory, got poor reception (phone issue), poor screen size and resolution, terrible camera, the only thing I liked about it was the physical keyboard, though that eventually got annoying because my \"I\" button became half broken...Though this is not a review of the replenish, I say all that to say that the ZTE Warp was a very nice upgrade for me. I got it on sale on black friday in 2012 at a best buy mobile and was excited to have a large, full touch screen phone.So here's what I liked about the ZTE Warp.Nice, large, full touch screen  -Apps looked nice and were much clearer than beforeBetter reception than my old samsung replenishMore sturdy than the replenishSwipe to textNicer, sleeker looking design.MUCH more internal and external (memory card) memory.That's essentially it.The things I disliked?Sucky camera and video recorderAverage battery life (fixed with a battery saver app)Volume on ringer is quieter than I'd like.Still kinda sucky reception in places  -It was better than before but not nearly as good as it could be.The messaging/texting app.  -It was sometimes very sensitive, and wouldn't finish swiping a word even tho I hadn't lifted my finger.  -It wouldn't let me \"add things to the dictionary\" like some phones will pick up things that you type and remember them and stop correcting them. This phone won't.  -T9 swipe kinda sucks.  -Trying to just type and not swipe would make little hints come up saying \"try swiping from letter to letter\" and as far as I could tell there was no way to turn this off.  -When it's cold, or if your hand is cold, swipe is basically useless.  -The absence of a physical keyboard coupled with the bad haptic feedback made me not a fan of the texting app.Soooo many buggy issues.  -I was consistently taking the battery out and putting it back in because the phone would freeze or shut itself off and not turn back on.  -The WiFi would be glitchy in places where it should be working quite well. Like a college campus.I originally thought the buggy issues were just the phone that I had, so I went and exchanged it for the same phone at another best buy in mid-December. I got the same glitchy issues with a different phone. It's just the design of the phone.I didn't totally hate this phone. It was definitely an improvement over what I had. If this is your first smartphone, you'll probably really like it. If you're coming off of a really crappy smartphone like I did, you'll probably really like it as well.

Overall, I am not a fan and would never buy another one. In detail...  Apps - I am not a heavy apps user, I'd say I'm probably average. The standards, Facebook, The Weather Channel, Fandango, WWF, Draw Something. You know, the basics. Still, this phone seems incapable of handling apps well. The main issue that most people don't recognize is that this phone is exactly like an iPod Touch. You need to manually shut down your apps or they continue running in the background and eat up your memory.  Battery - It's an Android. I don't expect Herculian potential from what is essentially a tiny computer with a battery not big enough to sustain much activity. I will say it does seem to drop rather fast. Standby battery life, not too bad. Overall, it's not great though.  Technical Issues - Yes, this phone freezes a lot. A LOT. Numerous times it will shut off and turn back on at random, even if I haven't used it at all that day. HOWEVER, almost every review I see about it freezing is shocking. You're NOT supposed to remove the battery. It's akin to unplugging your computer when it freezes. Bad things happen to it, mmkay? You end up damaging the OS by removing the battery when it freezes, which just causes you more problems and subsequently more freezing. Now, this phone will shut off and reboot itself **if you are patient enough**. Sometimes it takes 30 seconds, sometimes 2 minutes. If you leave it alone, 9 times out of 10 it will reboot on it's own. The consistency of it freezing up, despite what I just said, is pretty intolerable.  Calls - No real issues here. Some slight lag on button press on a rare occasion.  Texts - It's pretty common that I have to restart my phone to send and receive texts in a timely fashion. This thing practically craps it's pants if I try to send texts after charging it, which I find to be rather odd and pretty annoying. The truly difficult and irritating part is this... it'll say the messages are sent so you assume the other party has indeed received it. Wrong. After going all day a few times with NO responses to any messages from anyone, I restarted it on a hunch and my hunch proved correct. I got instantly spammed with over 20 messages I had been sent during the day that my phone just didn't feel like receiving. My friends told me that they in fact did not get any messages until that moment, and they got them all at once. I don't think it's a Boost problem, since my Husband has a different phone with them and he's never experienced that issue.  Navigation - Pretty middle of the road. Simple at some turns, and frustratingly inane and complicated at others. Some fairly common features of today's technology are missing entirely from this phone. Such as the ability to use custom notification text tones per contact. In fact, some of my custom tones decide to reset to factory default of their own accord rather frequently.!**And one more tidbit... you have to manually update this phone very often. I do it once a week. And it does NOT notify you that it requires an update.**!  If I missed anything, shoot me a comment. Feel free to ask any questions about the phone. Overall I would not recommend this phone.

One Night I had a call coming in and I could NOT answer the darn call because the phone Froze as the call was coming in an it just buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzed until I took the darn battery out. Another time I was talking to my Mother and the phone just shut off on me in the middle of our conversation.. This is my FIRST Android I\"ve been a Blackberry Girl for the past 5 yrs and I must say I MISS MY BLACKBERRY, Wish I would have just STuck to what I know for sure. (that works for me which is the Blackberry) So today I had two co-workers to take photos of me with the phone (they came out nice too) and then I get back to my desk and was about to up load the photos (at least one of them) to Instagram and the dang phone FROZE, then it Re booted itself, then when it came back up all the 5 pictures were GONE tossed out by the Stupid PHONE... OK OK lets be real I know that there are NO phone without Fault (I don't care how much you pay for one) There is going to be SOMETHING.. And I'm trying and or have Tried to work and deal with this one but I swear I find myself on a daily basis wanting to toss this into on coming HWY traffic!!!  i don't know if this is done more because of this being a refurb or what but it's Crazy... There have been several a days when my Incoming TEXT messages weren't coming in (un known to me) I couldn't really get it off top that amy incoming text wasn't coming in because my emails still came through (I still got those  notifications) I also still got my notifications for my Facebook and Twitter and my instagram stuff.. But I'll go all day with NO incoming text then later I think OH\" sh*t!!! it's not working so I have to remove the battery let it reboot then I'll have a ton of text to come through from a day before and current day.. I'm just being real here. I mean the phone is \"GOOD\" but WHEN IT WORKS.. I don't know how many times in a day now that it reboots itself or how many times I have to reboot it myself. Another thing I HATE about this phone is that Everything (app wise) that I download it goes onto my micro SD card and I just had to take the 1gb out and input the 2gb, but I still need bigger because ON my Blackberry I had LOST of music, Lots of Pics etc... now downloading certain apps with THIS android it cuts my songs off half way (to make room for the up load) and or I have to delete pics (with the 1gb) so I'm on the proll (soon) for a 8gb or 16gb micro SD for this Android.  Anyway this is all I can think of to complain about right now if I remember anything else I will be back to update... I do enjoy the phone When it works..... That is All... Happy Shopping.What I Am NOT complaining about is my plan on BOOST Mobile I love it and I've been with boost mobile about 5 yrs now.. I LOVE the LOW monthly cost (with shrinkage) for UNLIMITED SERVICE the same service you get with the BIG name contracted Cell phone companies.

I got one for myself and another for my fianc\u00e9. I knew I didn't want a little smart phone that would make it hard to text, and the reviews for this raved on the large screen. I do love the large screen, makes it much easier for texting. This is the first smart phone I have owned, and I really do like it a lot. I also want to say that I have the shrinking payments and I am paying $5/mo for insurance. My original Warp accidentally got stepped on and I had paid $200 for it. I only had to pay $65 for the replacement, which I felt was a really great deal.Some PROS that I found are:-The large screen, definitely. For texting, videos and pictures.-The camera takes clear pictures. Video works very well, also.-Being a smart phone, all of the apps that are available for it.Some CONS that I found are:-When the phone needs to update, it freezes and restarts itself.

I have travelled extensively.  I use practically no voice at all so I cant really speak to that.  I use the phone for posting photos and texts and most of all navigation.  I have various cameras and a magellan but I just like my phone and hardly ever bother with any of my other numerous gadgets.  My phone does jam a lot and restart.  I was looking for something with a lot of room.  I love love love apps.  I have every photography app there is.  I have Kindle and Nook and all kinds of stuff to read.  I must must must have my Words with Friends and Song Pop available at all time.  They work flawlessly!  Its almost impressive!  My photos edited with Friendcaster software are amazing.  I have a Nikon, Olympus, Lumix and I cant be bothered.  I have so much fun editing the shots as I take them and post them.  I take many many food shots and they are really good.  I had 4g phones in the past and was with VZ for ten years.  I would not go back.  I cannot and will not say Boost is top of the line carrier.  It isnt.  But it suits me just fine for what I pay and what I want....tremendous flexibility and no contract.  I love the textured back of the phone and feel of it.  The screen display is amazing altho people rave and rave about AMOLED and Retina as being the end all and be all but you absolutely cannot see any difference side by side unless you are doing a study but for average use there is no discernible difference in thse displays.  Warp is gorgeous.  I have Netflix also and Optimum.  This phone in combination with the money is the bomb.  I have a 16g card and use Swiftkey with voice.  The typical android battery situation is still intolerable however I have a RayOVac external battery I just hook up when the phone dies and I get a few extra hours out of it which is magic.  I'm going to One Click Root so far Ive been too busy and enjoying it without rooting it but I want to anyway. I just bought a hot pink case for it because I cannot stand diving for the phone in restaurants and the car and I cant see it.  I hate that. If they made a cellphone in safety orange I would be the first one to buy it.  Silver and black phones are horrible.  I put that heavy duty screen cover on it.  In a restaurant far away from home a waiter picked up the menu with my phone inside and I almost left the restaurant without it so I want a phone that stands out at all times and does not blend in with the scenery.

The office thing.Preinstalled programs I don't want to use. The ID thing.Text are sometimes recieved days later.Phone calls are of fuzzy quality when I call or recieve calls from out of state.Often when I recieve text messages or emails,my music will start up.

I called the carrier, who referred me to the zte warrenty people. I contacted the warrenty people in China who were very hard to understand. Very thick accents, which is not bad exept for the fact that I can't conduct proper buisness unless I can understand what the other party is saying! What should have been a 5 minute conversation turned into 25 mins. The lady said that she would send me an email which mever came. I had to send them an email first two days later. They emailed me back with instructions. It's been four days and no response. I'm paying a bill that isn't even good for this month! Money down the drain for a crappy phone that just decided to cease function one day. No real help for the warrenty. I am really not happy to say the least.I would recommend buying a phone with better customer service.

I was constantly deleting apps to make space for new apps. When Boost added the ZTE Warp to their phone lineup, I was very excited. The ZTE Warp boasted a higher resolution camera and a ton of space in comparison to my little Prevail. I eagerly purchased a Warp.I have never been more disappointed in a phone. After the initial honeymoon period ended, I began to actually try to use my Warp for real-life needs.Battery LifeThe battery life is terrible after the first couple of months (and yes, I followed all the initial charging instructions). I will charge this phone all night long, and it will be complaining that there is only 15% battery left by 9am the next day (after unplugging it at 7am). I have to take a charger with me everywhere I go. Buy a new battery and repeat.Sometimes if I want to use the phone I have to have it plugged into the charger at the same time. This is a major inconvenience. Not to mention, if I move the wrong way the phone powers off.Sometimes when I charge the Warp and I try to turn it one while charging it goes into an endless reboot cycle. One time I counted 15 reboots before I got frustrated enough to unplug it.Oh, and sometimes when I plug this phone into the charger, it refuses to come on. No red light or anything. I have to take out the battery and hold the power button to drain all of the residual electricity before replacing the battery and trying again.FreezingThis phone constantly freezes. It seems that the only thing that get's this phone's attention it taking out the battery and starting all over.CameraThis phone is supposed to have a good camera. The camera sucks. My photos are distorted (and yes, I've cleaned the lense).Incoming messages and callsMy Warp is extremely unreliable when it comes to receiving text messages. People will ask me if I got their text. No, I didn't. As a matter of fact, often it will be quite some time since I receiving any text message. Reboot the phone... and magic: 10 text messages.Incoming calls sometimes also go straight to voicemail in spite of the phone being powered on with decent reception.Demon PossessionI'm convinced this phone is possessed by Satan. Just kidding. But it certainly has a mind of it's own. On the rare time it is actually holding a charge, it will randomly reboot. No warning. If you are in the middle of a phone call, oh well. Call them back and apologize for your piece of crap phone, just remember to tell them that you didn't buy the cheapest phone on the planet, you just got taken for a ride and swindled.I am shopping for a replacement phone, but I've learned my lesson and this time I am doing far more research before wasting my money.

Was with them for 10 years and moved on to another carrier who turned out to be even worse. Again no names but rhymes with Schmirgin Schmobile. With the last carrier my phone crapped out and found out that lots of other customers had had the same issue with said phone and kept getting the runaround in terms of replacing it with a better phone. The replacements kept messing up, all due to a flaw that could easily be fixed but anyway, as soon as I saw this phone on the Boost website I was hooked. I'm a sucker for a big screen as I watch a lot of videos and I text alot and it helps to not have to squint at the screen. I did alot of research for this phone and jotted down all the \"cons\" that people were mentioning. As soon as I got the phone and took it out of the box it was like I could hear angels singing in the background. Of course for the next two weeks I paid special attention to the cons and to my surprise not one of them applied to my handset. Not one. Yes it's got short battery life when you're using it to download stuff or play games, every phone is like that. I saw cons ranging everywhere from low ringer volume to cheaply made buttons. The low ringer volume was an easy fix, apps for that. Buttons are just fine. It has frozen up a couple times for a few seconds. The music randomly playing would have been a con but I read about how one guy fixed his issue and I did the same thing and no problems since. Low alarm clock volume. Again there's an app for that, I downloaded some loud siren apps and they do the trick.  Let's see what else, oh yeah the camera. People were saying it takes horrible pictures but I've taken about a dozen photos with and without flash and they've all come out really clear (love the dedicated camera button, my last two phones did not have one)And although not a con so much as a pain in the butt, batteries for the phone are hard to find. I recently ordered a higher capacity battery for the ZTE on EBAY for 5 bucks, although it's being shipped from China. Accessories as a whole though are pretty easy to find. I can't think of any reason that I would have to change phones again. Boost customer service was also a con I saw but the 3 times I had to reach them it was minimal hold time, reasonably fast customer service time and everyone spoke English really well.

I have had my fair share of phones, all different brands (about 15) and services (5) and I am pretty easy on them. I usually update when some new software comes out. This phone has pretty much been the worst one yet. I definitely DO NOT recommend it!The display: I give it about an 8. The graphics are pretty good and the display is bright. It does have a glare on it when using it out in sunlight. I tend to turn my display down to 25% to save battery life and in order to see the screen clearly I need to turn it to at least 50%. Its good but not pristine.The camera is descent. If you are in bad light you wont get any advantage out of the flash!Battery: I am a heavy app user and I have witnessed my battery decrease 15% in 3 minutes just using twitter! -.- WTF?! I charged my phone right before I went to sleep, and immediately checked the battery when I woke up (to see how far the battery would go down just on stand-by), I was at 40%. If you can live without 3G then the battery life is commendable! My phone lasted 8hrs with only a 20% decrease.Text input: My uncle and dad used my phone fairly well seeing they have big fingers. I personally hate the new android layout for this phone - I cannot turn predictive text off, so I had to download a whole new text application to use!My phone CONSTANTLY freezes!!!!!! I thought the other reviewers were exaggerating, but they were giving understatements!!! In the first 24 hours of getting the phone it froze twice. In the month+ that I have had it, it has frozen AT LEAST once a week, sometimes when Im not even doing anything. It also randomly restarts all the time.The phone also randomly plays music from my collection! I mean it stats even when I have closed out of the program. It can be embarrassing if you are in the wrong place at the wrong time!I get very bad signal in places I shouldn't (they worked with my Samsung Transform- same service).The speed, build, and call quality are pretty decent. I have nothing bad to say, but nothing to brag about either!!!Overall, this phone is NOTHING to brag about!!! I would definitely go for something else. The phone is not worth the price for all the aggravation - it effects the everyday use. Please save yourself the hassle!
