{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "lindaaa1", "ReviewID": "R19783EH4DN8QD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is no fancy smartphone with apps and a touchscreen, but it still is a great phone. The QWERTY keyboard is easy to use, and has a variety of messaging options, such as text messaging, picture messaging, email, instant messaging (great for me to chat with my buddies on Yahoo), and you can even send people an audio postcard. As a messaging addict who has to bring her phone everywhere, and sends about 4,000 text messages each month (a little too much, maybe?) this is a great phone to connect with other people. Call quality isn't bad, but I never really call anybody anyways. There's no unusual static or muffled noise. I like that it has a music player so I can listen to music. It has a background playing option to play music while I do something, like text message. Excellent for when I'm too lazy to turn on my iPod. The internet browser doesn't have lighting fast 4g speed like many phones today, but 3g is enough for someone, like me, who occasionally browses the web and checks her Facebook daily. The T-Mobile social buzz app is convenient, but I prefer going on Facebook through the mobile browser. It has a good battery life span, and doesn't need nightly charging like my previous phone. It also has a 1.3 megapixel camera for taking pictures and video recording. I use an 8GB MicrSsd card with this phone, but the maximum you could use is 16GB. It has Bluetooth too, great for headsets, transferring files, etc.There are things I would change about this phone, however. Many complain about the name that actually uses the emoticon \":)\". I don't really mind, though. One con for me would be the color scheme. I don't mind it's dark and black, but it would be nice to have more brighter colors. Oh well, it's not a big problem. It doesn't have a headphone jack, but you can always get an adapter or the headset made for this phone. The camera quality isn't the best, since it is 1.3 megapixels, but I don't need any professional photographer quality.All in all, it's an excellent phone. I wouldn't recommend it to those who are used to fancy smartphones and touchscreens, but it's great for those who look for an easy-to-use and simple messaging phone with a QWERTY keyboard(especially teenagers).", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent little phone", "Author": "L. Shumway \"LAS\"", "ReviewID": "RSJFHHRDDT15O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung T359 is a great little phone for someone who does not feel the need to be glued to the phone constantly. If you must have a smart phone, look at a little higher price range. If you just want something that is easy for making phone calls, sending texts and sending the occasional picture message with basic internet coverage, this is a good choice. The phone slides out to reveal a full textboard. Games are available for purchase and you can easily customize your ring tones. With t-mobile--as I had occasion to find out when I spilled water on my old phone, it's a simple matter to move your sim card from one t-mobile phone to an unlocked one without having to pay an activation fee(they'll charge $15 for this if you buy a new phone from them).", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone !", "Author": "B. Whiting", "ReviewID": "R1M50QCJB28J2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE this phone. Recently, my other phone was starting to die. I was reticent to buy another phone because I've hated other \"upgrades\" I'd gotten as they were too inconvenient to use. The reviews were really high on this phone so I decided to give it a try. It was such a smooth transition from my old flip phone. It has so many familiar features only each upgraded to work even better. The sound quality is great. The speaker phone works really well. The music playing is great. It is really easy to use. It is sleek and classy looking. I am so glad I bought it and you will be to. I dont' use the internet or email, so can't vouch for those features. But, I wanted a phone that I could transition to those features if I ever decided to. I just call, text and take photos and this phone works great for me. The pictures are high quality too.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great talking and texting phone", "Author": "Beckster", "ReviewID": "R2ICC4R4V6UKJ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this phone already from T-mobile but after a really hard drop on concrete the screen cracked leaving part of it unreadable.  I ordered this as a replacement because it was cheaper than through T-mobile since I didn't have a replacement plan.  Bonus was this phone came with a wall charger AND car charger.  I only use this phone for talking and texting and its great for both those things.  I love the vertical slider versus the sideways slider.  If you're looking for a basic phone that does texting also and your fingers aren't too big for the smaller QWERTY keys I would definitely recommend this phone.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works well", "Author": "Wendy", "ReviewID": "R28VALJ9YOJNTH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased this for my daughter, to replace a touch screen that fizzled out due to humidity. This one has worked well -she's had it for about a year now -without internet access. She can't take pictures any more because the slide some how interferes and has scratched the lens- error in design I suppose.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Smiley", "Author": "Avery Watson", "ReviewID": "R1WO2HNUA62TQG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for a little bit more than a year.  However, I didn't purchase it via Amazon.  When I first got it I created contacts very easily; I like how you can add special info about the contact as well.  It is fairly easy to text with its QWERTY keyboard.  I love how it slides up and not from the side with most modern smartphones.  This smartphone is not your fancy schmancy iPhone though.  However, that suits me better because the touch screen on some smartphones can be very sensitive and ANNOYING!  You do have to pay for apps and the Internet on this phone; I don't purchase or pay for it because I have other devices that have apps.  I love the \"Organizer\" feature in the menu with the calculator, memos, tasks, etc.  OVERALL THE NAME OF THIS PHONE MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I AM ALWAYS SMILING WHEN USING IT!", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT TEXTING PHONE!", "Author": "Christen J.

The sliding open nature of the phone to text will destroy the lens on the camera no matter what you do.  So in say...4 months, kiss your camera goodbye as everything will be totally clouded over.  Any kind of moisture gets on this phone...seeya!  My aunt got a couple of drops of water and now hers cant use any buttons on the top of the phone.  I stay right smack dab next to a T-Mobile tower and every single time (yes EVERY TIME) I go to use the \"web browser\" it immediately cuts off the internet connection and I have to go through 5 to 6 relaunches to get the page Im seeking to pull up.  Pro side:  voice clarity, and the fact that I tripped and launched my phone a good 8 feet in the air and 20 feet downrange until it landed on concrete and came apart with the phone going one way, battery another, and back cover yet another.  I knew the phone was DOA, but put it all back together and it worked fine.

She is very happy with everything, except the supplier through Amazon sent us a bad charger cord that looked like it had been wet and abused.  The tag was white and almost falling off when we got it and had a short in it.  But, the phone works great, and my daughter likes it better than her old phone.  She has had it for a couple months now.  It texts well and has a lot of options.  Good value!
