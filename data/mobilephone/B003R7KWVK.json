I turned it on & started using it right awau, I noticed that the keys would get stuck & type something like \"johhhhnnnnyy\" instead of just \"johnny\" so as soon as I realized it wasn't me that was doing it, I e-mailed the company & asked them if I could send the phone back to get it fixed but I let them know I had cracked it & they said then there would be a small fee but that they would be able to do it. I pay the $20 to ship out my phone & once it gets over there the manager messages me stating that he cannot fix the phone because of the crack. Once I asked him to reimburse me the $$ for sending it & he saw the reciept, I guess he realized it was just cheaper to go ahead & fix it. He gave me a new housing so the crack I made was gone, but my keyboard is still messed up!!!! Don't bother with these \"Blackberrypdasmartphone\" company!!

Lastly, I had problems with the battery charger as it became too loose and I had to tape it onto the phone to keep it tight enough so I could charge the battery.My wife's phone: The first 2 weeks It was fine, but suddenly the screen started leaking and a large dark patch was shown on the screen. Additionally, she was not able to type a message or write anything because the typing keys were too loose.I have returned my phone today and I will return my wife's within a couple of months as she is out of the Country.
