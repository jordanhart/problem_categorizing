I received the BROWN VERSION . This is so disappointed because if I chose this seller was because they supposed to have the SILVER version...I saw the brown one much cheaper with other sellers...so at the end I paid more money and I get the same cheaper version.A mi me paso lo mismo que a estas personas. Yo ordene la version Silver y me enviaron la de color cafe. Estoy disgustada porque escogi este vendedor solo por que tenia la version plateada a la venta...en otros lugares vi el celular cafe mucho mas barato... al final pague mas dinero (segun yo por la version Silver) y al final recibi el mismo celular cafe el cual yo NO queria.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "WRONG PHONE", "Author": "DRB", "ReviewID": "R2QN2Z95LN9VI9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am unhappy in that I have just received the phone and it is the T-Mobile version of the phone. To make matters worse, the phone was not silver but gold instead. Also, the buttons are a bit different from those displayed in the listing.Thankfully I still like the phone.I thought there may have just been a mix up in my order until I saw someone else had recently posted a similar problem wrt it being the T-Mobile version. The listing really needs to be updated to reflect the product accurately. The variations between the the image displayed in the listing and the actual product, whether intentional or not, makes buyers like myself feel a bit cheated.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "WRONG PHONE!", "Author": "compnerd21", "ReviewID": "R2SBSFZBGPUGFD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Horrible, ive tried ordering this item twice from two different sellers, and i have been sent the t-mobile version twice, DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "so so smart phone", "Author": "wings", "ReviewID": "R3TSZLTBMAPLVN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is my first smart phone. I am so thrilled when the parcel is delivered. Sadly, my excitement is quickly dampened after realizing (though indicated to be in the box) that the SIM card is missing which perforce a trip to a T Mobile Store for its activation. I find the HTC T7373 Touch Pro to be relatively weighty mainly due addition of the qwerty key pad.  It is a neat scheme to put lots of applications on the unit.  Scrolling the window screen reveals unfamiliar names like \"Handango in Hand, JETSET Presenter5 and JBlend\".  I am befuddled by many applications that I can not even point my finger where to start and what it is for.  But, as a beginner I prefer to download them as they are needed.I have a difficulty in getting the Stereo FM radio to work so I go to a TMobile Store only to be informed that this feature is not supported. I wish it was there because I move around a lot, and I need the radio to keep me entertained and informed.From 1 to 10, 10 being the highest, I shall give it a 4.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "I sold something diferntes to what the pictures show, el vendedor me enga\u00f1o", "Author": "Matceni", "ReviewID": "R2WJ92NUFC46RQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I feel really upset, because both the pictures and the features presented by the seller of the 2 phones, according to the Product Features and Technical Details that showed them in the purchase page to buy cellphones should have FM radio and not have it, you sent me phones in brown, not gray and has no front camera as the photos show.does not seem right that the pictures show one thing and sell another.I am very upset and would not recommend this place to someone else to buy on this siteActually this article is an irresponsible seller, I personally would never buy from this store and would not recommend to do so, the phone is good, but the seller is irresponsible.The phone has no front camera is not silver, is biggerRealmente este articulo este vendedor es un irresponsable, en lo personal no volver\u00eda a comprar a esta tienda y no recomendar\u00eda que lo hagan, el tel\u00e9fono es bueno, pero el vendedor es irresponsable.El tel\u00e9fono no tiene la camara frontal, no es plateado, es mas grande.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Be careful about this seller-Firemall LLC", "Author": "Jayakiran Pagadala", "ReviewID": "R1V89Z6GUZRTAM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I tried buying a phone.

This phone is for T-Mobile plans only, it clearly shows the T-Mobile logo in the picture. I have tried to sell this phone on amazon for awhile now. I finally just had amazon send it back to me because so many people expect to get a different phone, this phone does not come in silver it states that this phone comes in MOCHA, which is a brown color. I feel as though people who order this phone do NOT look at all the details about this phone close enough, I'm tired of having to pay amazon for shipping because the customer sends the phone back, not because it wasn't good quality just because the customer thought they were going to get a different product entirely.
