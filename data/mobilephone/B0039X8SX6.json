She absolutely does not know how to use anything...cell phone, cd player, computer.  This phone is perfect for her.  All she has to do is open it, arrow up or down to the person she wants to call, and push call. She loves it.  The phone came in perfect condition at a much, much lower price than if purchased from a retail store in person.  It is easily set up with easy to read instructions and easily accessible \"real people help\" if you need to call.Anyone technologically challenged who wants a cell phone just for calling, or wants one for a loved one in the same situation should seriously consider Jitterbug.  Consumer Cellular has a great deal, but their service is spotty, and there were numerous dead spots when using their phone. Jitterbug has no problems.  I was a skeptic, but this phone has proven me wrong.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Good.", "Author": "C. Sahu \"Cathy Sahu\"", "ReviewID": "R36OXRTBSXKXRS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone for my brother, who's an invalid. Luckily, I decided to charge and activate the phone before giving it to him.When I received the Jitterbug, I plugged it in to charge it. After a few hours the screen said, \"Charge completed.\" So I unplugged and called GreatCalls to have the phone activated.The operator picked up in about a minute. (Good.) But already I could tell the reception was poor - I couldn't hear every other word or so. The operator told me it was because I hadn't charge the battery long enough - even though the screen said, \"Charge complete,\" I should charge it for 12 hours. (I thought he sounded a little irritable, but maybe that was my imagination. He did, after all, have to repeat himself because of the bad connection.)So I plugged the phone back into the charger. The next day, after more than 12 hours of charging, when I again called GreatCalls to activate the phone, it continued to crackle and then lost the call altogether.I called GreatCalls back because, even though I was pretty sure at this point that the phone needed to be returned, I wanted to check if they had any more words of wisdom. Once again, the phone reception was breaking up - both for me and for the operator. So she took my other cell phone number and called me there. I explained everything I've written above but the lady said, \"Oh, I'm sure the phone is fine. I think the problem is on my end. Let me help you activate the phone.\"I pointed out that she was the third operator I had spoken to and that, last time, the phone had dropped the call altogether. She continued to insist that the phone was fine: \"It's my headset. There's something wrong with it.\"I pointed out that she was talking to me just fine with her headset on my other cell phone! She didn't have an argument for that but still wanted to activate the Jitterbug!!I said, \"No thanks, I don't want to activate.\" (I do have to admit that she was consistently polite.)So I'm returning the Jitterbug and not getting another one. If it were just a problem with the phone itself, I would probably have had it exchanged for another Jitterbug. The Jitterbug phone is actually made by Samsung and the cell tower service is through Verizon. That's how my own cell phone is and I've had no real problems with it.But I really felt that the operators just want to make the sale and don't care about what problems the customer might have afterwards. I mean, if I had given this phone directly to my brother, who's never had a cell phone, he might have believed what the nice lady said and let her activate it. Then, in an emergency, he wouldn't have been able to use it. Or, at some point, I would have asked my brother how the phone was working, and he'd have admitted he didn't use it because he couldn't hear, and I'd have had to return the phone anyway, after having paid for monthly service fee for who knows how long?Also, the first operator was just stringing me along, I think, by telling me the phone needed to be charged 12 hours. Why would incomplete charging cause the transmission to crackle? Neither operator admitted that there might be something wrong with the phone.And we live in Southern California, well within Verizon service territory, so it couldn't have been a problem with that.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for ease of use and Seniors", "Author": "Andee", "ReviewID": "R20XIUQTKG2O65", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought for my Aunt who is in her 80's, it is her first cellphone. She loves the phone although it is a little bigger than I thought it would be. The Jitterbug people are so nice and are available 24/7. I was able to completely program all the numbers on my computer for her on her phone.The phone has a speaker button and is loud so that's good. There is no 911 button. She would have to dial 911 then hit send. Not sure if that would present a problem in an emergency. The gray button on the outside should be removed it is just to change the volume but she accidently hits it sometimes.

She very patiently set up my mom's phone. She didn't even have to input her own contacts. They did this for her. If she forgets how to call me, she can just push the \"yes\" botton twice and it will ring my phone. Plans can be changed at any time to add more minutes and I can do this for her from my computer or she can just call customer service anytime.

We ordered the Jitterbug for our 87-year-old aunt to use when the power fails or she can't easily get out of her chair to make a call. First problem: the manual says \"charge for 12 hours before using\" and the phone's screen says \"charge complete\" in just a couple hours. Second problem: when we called to activate the phone (we gave it 12+ hours), the service rep was fumbling, confused and confusing. Very poor, even somewhat rude, communication on his part which I ascribe to poor training and inadequate monitoring. Third problem: we were surprised by the activation fee of $39.63, which I don't remember reading in the sales pitch for the Jitterbug. If it's stated, it's not prominently mentioned. Fourth problem: the \"phonebook\" function is not working properly. No matter which selection we make, the phone calls the SAME number. Four calls to customer service yielded four different solutions, none of which worked.  Fifth problem: when I woke up yesterday, I discovered the service provider had charged that darn activation fee to our debit card FOUR TIMES for a total of $158.52! So now we have another headache.

McDonald", "ReviewID": "R19CD7YX2VOU4L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The conceit of this phone is that it's easy for an elderly person to use. I would say that it is *possible* for an elderly person to use it, but I would not say it was easy for my mom. The design takes a lot for granted and is not intuitive for someone coming from a traditional corded or cordless phone. If you're buying this for someone elderly who isn't used to small/mobile phones, do not expect them to understand it quickly. But there's a good chance they'll get it eventually.First, when someone who is elderly/confused opens the phone, which end is up? For the first week, my mom had a 50/50 chance of putting the microphone to her ear. (Note that a traditional phone has either a cord or antenna to orient you. If you leave this phone plugged in, it's easier to use.) Yes there's a keypad and screen, but the external cues are weak. In my mom's case, the phone proved confusing. You might say that's ridiculous, I'm just reporting what I saw.Second, the yes/no buttons and arrows are reasonably intuitive for someone used to navigating menu systems, but are not at all intuitive for someone who hasn't used a computer or modern mobile phone. And \"yes\" and \"no\"? This choice makes sense for some things, not for other things. (Ideally, you'd have buttons that changed text according to context, but I realize this would make the phone more expensive.) The good news is that my Mom is now able to make calls and answer the phone, but it took a while.Finally, despite what I was told when I activated the phone, the website will not allow you to change plans or add minutes. I spent a lot of time mucking around on the web site only to learn that you have to call customer service to do that. (There is now a pop up message to this effect.) And when I did call customer service to add minutes, I learned that the plan information I was seeing on the web was different than what the customer service person told me I had! In the end she was able to add minutes so the \"official\" system showed the same minutes as what was showing on the web, but it was pretty amateurish.Two pluses: The service plans are reasonable. And it's great that you can customize the phone menu from the web. Of course, you can do something like that for lots of phones these days, but it's still a very useful feature.Would I buy it again? Probably not. With hindsight the alternative of a traditional landline phone would have been smarter. It certainly would have been less stressful for everyone at the outset. And it might even have been less expensive.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for inexperienced phome users", "Author": "pebarbdd", "ReviewID": "RJOF8K8SZFJ0P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Jitterbug for my 91 year old mother.

My experience with their customer support has been good so far, but I haven't used it much.  I was very impressed with their coverage map, and so far I've not run into any dead zones.  On the other hand, I'm told that my reception is only \"Fair\" a lot more often than I expected in a well-populated area.  I am 60 and this is, I believe, my fourth cell phone.  I do love the large buttons.  I find that choosing between yes and no doesn't always make sense for what you are trying to do, but neither do the equivalent options on most phones.  Two buttons, whatever they are labeled, just don't fit all situations.  But this is something you will most likely get used to.I think there is much to like about this phone, so I'm very disappointed that it also has a number of significant drawbacks that will probably have me moving on to another phone in a year or two:- I was beyond disappointed (ie, stunned) to find that the names you enter into the phonebook are listed in tne order of entry, not alphabetically.  This means you have to laboriously scroll through up to 50 names to find the one you want to call. Surely this must be difficult for arthritic fingers, which I am fortunate not to have so far.  I expect Great Call's thought is that you can just call Customer Service and have them dial the number for you. I can't imagine anyone wanting to be in situation where they have call a third party every time they want to make a phone call, any more than they would want to have to scroll through a whole lot of numbers first.  (You just want to pick up the phone and call.)  Presumably some users are sufficiently challenged that this is the best they can do, but...these folks are probably not going to use the phonebook anyway.  So, if you are going to HAVE a phonebook, you want to be able to find names in it easily.  I still can't believe they aren't alphabetized.  This is such a no-brainer, and, given that every other cell phone I've ever had or used stored the names alphabetically, it can't be all that hard.- If you enter more than the maximum 50 names in the phone book, the phone just deletes one to make room for #51, instead of telling you that you are at max and letting YOU decide if you want to delete one of the existing numbers (and WHICH number you want to delete).  I'm thinking it is probably first in/first out, so probably the number that is deleted is the one that was so important to you, you entered it first of all.  This phone will last with me until the day I look for a number and find it's been deleted. Then it's in the trash.- You can't tell if the phone is on standby or off.  This is kind of ironic, because every time you call customer service, they make a point of urging you to keep your phone on at all times.  I find myself checking it several times throughout the day, and I would think people who are not accustomed to having a cell phone would be constantly checking it to make sure it is on.This will be a good choice for some people, no doubt.  For me, it's one of those \"If only....\" situations. I would love it if the features were as well designed as the phone itself.

EXCELLENT CHOICE FOR SENIORS!!", "Author": "LG", "ReviewID": "R393IJMQJZFPGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, in my humble opinion, this phone seems to be the type of phone that is custom made for seniors, disabled seniors, or disabled individuals only. That said, I was more than delighted when I received this phone which, luckily for me, was on a promo which discounted the pricey 99.00 Jitterbug J to 50%.  I do object to the pricey plans re: the Unlimited 24/7 free minutes plan is a whopping $79.00 a month and so I had to go for the Premium plan which is $39.00 for 400 weekday minutes until 7 pm-5 am in which it's free and unlimited weekends.  For me, it's not that bad because I am not a chatty type but if I feel like having a long conversation with someone I can save it for the evenings and weekends. Also the minutes are roll-over minutes for 60 days.  The only other cons are 1) the customer service reps are quite young and impatient, seemingly not trained to understand senior issues, and 2)the speakerphone could be louder. Speaker phone is a big need for me because I have severe chronic pain issues and have trouble with holding the phone. If I DO hold the phone, it's nice to have those grippers on the side so that the sleek phone does not slip out of  my hand. The last con is voice dial. I love that also because it is totally hands free to call anyone in your address book.  However when you tell the phone the name, it repeats it back in an almost unintelligible way.  Eventually you get used to the mispronunciation.  I feel as if all the people that are complaining just don't get the concept of the Jitterbug.  It is PERFECTLY designed for disabled, ill, or elderly people who have health issues. I have weak sight, practically crippled in the shoulders and arms and those other cell phones were all but impossible for me to understand or use. On Jitterbug J you can even dial a LIVE operator 24/7 to help you to plan events for your calender.  They have a MedCoach app that is saving my life by giving me reminder calls to take my many meds.  It also will call you when your refills are due and even call the pharmacy number for you!!  I have SEVERE short term memory loss and previously forgot to take my meds and refill them which created a few dangerous health episodes. If you are younger and expecting a phone with fun features and lots of variety, it will not be for you.  I also find the ringer to be quite loud enough. My phone is bright red and it keeps me from losing it.  Also, there IS a whole different way of programming this phone and it is a bit annoying at first but once you get the hang of it, it's smooth sailing and unbelievably easy.  I absolutely LOVE this phone and plan to be with GreatCall for the rest of my life but do not recommend it to people who are young and healthy.  It's perfect for anyone with vision issues, problems with shoulder, arm, and hand mobility, and short term memory loss.  It's also comforting to know that there is always someone to call in Customer Service 24 hours a day for free even if they are not trained well.

It couldn't be activated properly by the Great Call company and yet I was charged the Activation Fee and Monthly Fees for Nov. and Dec. Three days before visiting my folks in Chicago, my mom misplaced the non-functioning Jitterbug phone...little wonder. I bought a new one for my folks and was, stupidly, talked into purchasing a monthly \"phone replacement\" fee of $4. In addition, I paid for an expedited shipping fee, which took several days for the phone to get from Libertyville, IL to Chicago, IL when I was promised that it was to be only 2 days. Finally, charged the phone only to find out that the Great Call rep activated the wrong phone. Then I was told by another rep that it would only take an hour for the old phone to be \"unactivated\" and for the new one to get activated. Called again since the activation process STILL didn't work and was told by another rep that the activation process would take another 24 hours at which this time I told Great Call that I was quite fed up with their poor business practices and customer service and to just cancel the entire service and refund my money. I was to return their phone to them only to get the purchase price after 21 BUSINESS DAYS!!! Really? I am reporting this company to the IL BBB and to the IL State Attorney General's Office as a scam company that preys on the elderly.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "phone was obsolete", "Author": "wayne parenteau", "ReviewID": "RGZJR29WKW4EJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone was an obsolete model and because it was outdated Jitterbug would not activate it.

It only holds a charge for a short time so I am constantly re-charging. Calls are frequently dropped even though I live in an urban area which should have good reception. The phone only rings when someone is calling me about 1/4 of the time, calls go to voice mail even if I am sitting next to the silent phone. Calls almost always have static. You must pay extra for voice mail, and there is a separate charge if you take photos. You have to pay to retrieve them.

Great Call's set up service, excellent.  I had read about the \"Jitterbug\" a few years back and when I decided I would try to live my retired days with cell service only the \"Jitterbug\" was my choice. My Verizon phone is getting old but gets fairly good service on the island and I thought I read somewhere that \"Jitterbug\" operated over the Verizon network. But my little red phone's capability was poor giving me dropped/lost service calls.  I love the phone and would like to know how I could use the \"Jitterbug\" as a verizon serviced phone or how to return a new \"Jitterbug\" phone in \"unopened condition\" as the label states when I have had to use it to find out it doesn't work for me here, now.

Rich\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZSIIBORG0K4P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My wife and I are both in our 60's and had our cell service with AT&T; for years, but we lost thousands of minutes each year because we don't make that many calls. Long story short we made the switch to Jitterbug about 4 months ago. We went with the Jitterbug plus. First the good news. The telephone feature is adequate if all you want to do with this phone is make a call every now and then. The customer service has always been helpful to us, even though they haven't always been on the same page, and the monthly cost is very good. So much for the good news. After about a week the mic on my phone just stopped working. No, I hadn't dropped it or allowed it to get wet. Greatcalls said they'd send a new one at no charge since it was within the 90 day warranty. The phone arrived and I called to activate the new one. The service rep may not have understood the specifics, but he told me to just keep the old phone even though the paperwork with the new phone said to send it back. I decided to send it back using the return label that came with the new one. When the next bill came I had been charged $99 for the new phone! I called Customer Service to get the charge removed and was told they couldn't locate the returned phone. After talking to a supervisor I was told that they would eliminate the $99 charge, which they did. Now as for the phone itself. Calling is not a major problem, but texting is terrible. First there is a limit to how many texts the phone will hold. This information was nowhere in the sales info. Customer service told me that they thought the phone would only hold 20 texts, so if you haven't deleted texts in a day or two, any texts after number 20 are never received. What's even worse is that there is no notification or tracking when you have reached the max. Additionally, the phone doesn't have t9 texting, ugh, and you can only send a text to one person at a time. Once it's sent you have to retype it to send it to someone else. Probably the worst feature is what happens if you are in the process of texting and you receive a text at that moment......which happens a lot if you're carrying on a text conversation. When that happens the text you are typing immediately changes into numbers and asks if you want to make a call! To continue you first have to reject the incoming text, then jump through two more hoops. Trust me, the texting feature is a mess. If you want a very basic phone to make calls, this will do, but anything beyond that is just such low technology that it's more trouble than it's worth.
