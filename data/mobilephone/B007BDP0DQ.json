What a great buy. This phone actually made me disconnect my service from Verizon. Obviously this can't/couldn't work for everybody (especially if you HAVE TO HAVE internet wherever you go.. ) but here it goes..-----**I primarily use wifi either at my home (I have a 30mbps connection) or at my Job. I have no need for data when im \"on the go\".**I purchased an app called \"GrooveIP\" for 4.99. This app allows you to make/recieve calls through wifi using Google Voice. Usually Google voice only works on a computer but this app lets you make the calls on your phone.**Call quality is EXCELLENT! (Make sure you turn on \"adaptive echo canceller and audio processing. leave sync voice off\")**I bought a 100$ pre-paid card from at&t.; This card lasts an entire YEAR!Here's basically how it works..1) MY google voice phone number is forwarded to the ATT number which was given to me when I activated the SIM card.2) I have an app called AUTOAP that turns off 3g when im connected to wifi.3) What this means is when i'm home, if someone calls me, the call will go through wifi (grooveip) and will be free. When im not home and someone calls me, the call will get forwarded to the ATT number and my phone still rings. I have the option of answering the phone or letting it go to voicemail!4) If I decide to answer the call, I'm billed at .10c / min. Same rate if I decide to call out when I'm not in a wifi zone.I have a house phone that I pay 20$ for unlimited calls. This plan made me eliminate my 120$ bill from Verizon!To wrap it up. I pay about 28$ (20+ 100 card/12) per month to have a great phone with unlimited calls in my home and wherever I have wifi.***Other notes***I rooted the phone fairly easily and put a custom rom on it. This has made the phone have 90mb free of ram and removed all of the bloatware. The phone is zooming fast now. The camera is good for a phone (lets be honest, a cell phone is not a great camera)The sound of the earpiece is good. It could be better. It also has GPS on the phone. I got an app called NAVIGON which allows you to use GPS without using data. Now I have another use for this phone!!I really have nothing bad to say about this phone. It looks great too, very sleek. Very good midrange smart phone----Update 6/18/12Phone still working great! I have been trying different roms to see which one works best but I haven't really found one that is perfect. Some roms mess up grooveip's voice quality while others are very slow. Will post another update when I find the \"winner\".Battery life is VERY good. If im using wifi ocassionaly to surf the web and check email and make a few 10 min calls I can have a full charge for a few days!Build quality is also excellent. The phone has survived many falls/drops and still works excellent. Touch screen is very responsive----Update 11/09/12Phone has since bene lost! I am going to buy the upgraded fusion 2 since it is the SAME PRICE and is a dual core processor and has 2gb internal ram.. what this means is a much faster phone that has much more space internally that the previous iteration.As of right now.. there is very little to no reason in getting this version as the fusion 2 is superior in every regard----", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good basic smartphone, don't expect too much", "Author": "Honest Reviewer \"Mighty ER\"", "ReviewID": "R1NXG0B52OBJU7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone a few weeks ago and was told by 2 retailers that I could use my existing ATT SIM card with this GoPhone, which was true.  But they didn't tell me that ATT would detect that I was using a smartphone and then add a data plan to my account.  That bothered me.  I went to the ATT store and they said that that's their policy.  Fine.  Of course they added me the $30/3GB of data, so I downgraded to the $20/300MB, since I plan to use Data sparingly.  Why give them an extra $10 per month?As the title of my review says, it is a good, basic smartphone running Android 2.3.  Compared to the more advanced smartphones, this one feels a bit slow, but acceptable in my opinion.  There is no camera flash so if you would like to use your phone for lots of picture taking, I'd highly recommend that you pay more for a better phone with flash feature.  The picture quality is slightly less than average.The battery life so far has been very good.  If I don't run WiFi or Data much, I can go almost 2 full days without re-charging.  I certaily can go 1 full day with higher than moderate use.  I am not a heavy user so I would imagine that heavy users would have to charge their phone before the day is up.WiFi connection is a bit flaky.  Whereas my HP Pavilion g4 laptop has excellent connect speed at home, this phone has 1 maybe 2 bars of signal strength.  At times it seems to lose the connection.  Thus if you are far from the WiFi router, you might have these issues as well.  But I didn't expect much in terms of WiFi signal reception, given that it's a small device (i.e. antennas are smaller than in a laptop).My biggest complaint has been that internal memory is essentially non-existent.  After I upgraded the built-in apps, there was NO MORE space for additional Apps!!  This is my first smartphone, so I am not app-dependent as most smartphone users, so this hasn't been a problem as much as just a limitation to try and learn different apps.  I did add a memory card, but it seems that apps need to use the smartphone's internal memory, and cannot be installed in the micro SD card, no matter what size it is.  Don't let sales people tell you otherwise.  Facebook App and other useful apps are already installed so you don't have to worry about those, at least.Bottom line, if you need internet access on the go and want to get a decent basic smartphone for that, for whatever reason, this is one phone you should consider.  But if you have been spoiled by the more capable smartphones, this one will probably disappoint you.UPDATE:  After having the phone for 29 days, I decided to return it for a refund.  The phone began to constantly give me the error of low memory.  I could not ever try to install an app from Google Android store.  Browsing the internet would cause crashes more and more frequently.  There are a few other bugs I would encounter which by themselves are just minor, but after you begin to dislike a product, they really become annoying.  I change my rating for this phone from 3 stars to 2 stars.  I do not recommend it!!", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": ":)", "Author": "lindasierra", "ReviewID": "RLQ7PQEZZV62M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this because I wanted an android phone without a contract and data plan. Boy did it deliver!!I'm a previous Verizon prepaid customer, but they were just too expensive. I was paying $20 a month JUST for texting, I had to pay an extra $15 to be able to make phone calls.I was going to try a Verizon prepaid android, but they were asking $70 a month and that was their cheapest plan.I started to do some research and found the almighty go-phone and immediately fell in love with the at&t; fusion.It's an android smartphone running a 2.3 os. It's a full touch screen and is fully customizable(with up to 5 home screens)I bought it straight from the at&t; store where they activated it for me, so I was able to use it immediately.It has very good battery life. I started using it as soon as I left the store at 12:30 pm with a 50% charge and continued using it until I got home at 4:00pm and put it on the charger (without it dying).Texting is a breeze with the options of 3 different keyboards, including swype(you can download more keyboards from the android market.The best part is I am only paying $25 a month!! That's only 5 more dollars than my Verizon text plan (not including what I payed for calls) and not only do I get unlimited text, but also 250 talk minutes and that's with a significantly better phone(I previously had the Verizon blitz, which wasn't a bad phone, I've just had it for four years and felt the need for a change).And contrary to what most people say, a data plan IS NOT required with this phone. You can disable the data feature(so you can't get charged by accidentally using it) and just use wifi, which is what I do.Though, If you want a data plan, they start as low as $5 a month.I have to say, at&t; knows what they're doing!All in all, I definitely recommend this phone:)", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Replace contract/month-to-month phone on the cheap.", "Author": "pokeyokie", "ReviewID": "R30N3E58J1OXBR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this GoPhone as a replacement for my old phone and I love it! I use my SIM card (family plan with shared minutes, 3 lines) in this phone, as I have done several other times with GoPhones. I use them as cheap phone replacements so I don't have to do another contract. The phone is not a powerhouse having only a 600Mhz cpu and 256MB ram. The OS and AT&T; bloatware completely fill up the internal memory. Soooooo, I rooted the phone, removed all the crappy AT&T; bloatware (unwanted/unneeded apps), loaded a few apps I do want, moved all non-OS essential apps to the included 2GB SD card to free up additional internal storage, cleared the cache and tweaked a few settings. For a low-end Android smart phone it now runs really well, has a sharp screen, and does everything I want/need it to do. I do *NOT* buy a data card but utilize my own portable broadband hotspot via wifi. I'm a truck driver and the hotspot supplies both my phone and laptop with Internet connectivity. Make certain that disabling all phone data functions is the very FIRST thing you do (unless you want to purchase a data card each month) and use wifi instead. Needless to say, I am extremely happy with this phone. Just spend a few hours tailoring it to your own needs.

I've had it for several weeks now and it works great!  The apps and the web come up quickly, the pictures are of good quality and the screen clarity is good.  I have found only one down side so far and that's that I can't find a case for it yet...but was told they should be in this weekend, so hopefully I'll have that soon.  If you're looking for a smartphone/android phone and don't want the hassle of a contract, this phone is absolutely the way to go!!!", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "In Love With This Phone", "Author": "cas5533", "ReviewID": "R2KG65WZEHXBYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this phone about a month ago, and I really love it.

It does everything I want it to and a little more. I don't use many talking minutes per month, most of my communication is done through text messages, so I have this phone set up on the 10 cents per minute pay as you go plan and I buy a monthly text message package keeping my monthly phone bill down to $10 per month. I can get internet on it through any wifi that I can connect to, which is faster than any data plan and virtually everywhere, so I have no need for a data plan. They do have prepay options for data, but they do get pricy.My only complaint about this phone and the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the internal memory sucks. It comes with a 2gb memory card, upgradable to 32gb (which is nice for holding my music collection and a decent amount of movies), but the internal memory that the operating system and most apps live on is under 200mb. Out of the box, most of that memory is filled by AT&T; bloatware that can't be readily uninstalled, and on top of that, the bloatware will automatically update itself which will fill up your memory in no time. The solution to this annoyance is to root the phone and install an app like Root Explorer to go in and manually delete the bloat programs. Another must have app is App2SD or something similar, which will allow you to move most apps from the phone's internal memory to the SD Card, freeing up more space. Once both of these are done, the phone runs fast.That's all the customizing I've done to my phone, which is all I need, but the beauty of this phone is there's no limit to the customizing you can do. You can over clock it to make it run faster, you can install custom built operating systems, etc. There's a whole Android community out there to help you make the most of your phone. If you are looking for an inexpensive smart phone without any contracts, this is about as good a purchase as you're likely to find.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Clarification about Data Plan Charges....", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Fredia\"", "ReviewID": "R2EC87F4E0K4PM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Concerning the data fees...I'd like to add some clarifying details for those that are considering this phone. If you currently have an AT&T; contract or your contract has expired but you are still using their service, you will get charged with data fees if you take your SIM card from your current phone and place it in the AT&T; Fusion cell phone.However, if you use the SIM card from Go-Phone and use the Fusion as a prepaid phone then you won't get charged data fees unless you are actually using data.  You can still use the Android for talk, text, and WiFi.  If you start at the top of the phone and slide your finger down the screen it will pull down a menu which gives you the option to turn off Data, WiFi, etc.This is a great phone and the screen is very responsive.  Texting on this phone is a breeze.  I've used other touchscreen phones and have gotten frustrated because I couldn't get it to bring up the right letters that I was trying to type. With the Fusion I haven't had a problem at all with typing on the touchscreen.The camera is 3.2 megapixels, which is better than most phones that only have 2 megapixels.Sound clarity is great!", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "att fusion", "Author": "ken18328", "ReviewID": "R1TCNOT1G1AUG5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had the phone foe 4 months trouble free. Then it started repeating incoming text messages. Some messages came in for 5 days every 6-8 hours. others would repeat about 10 times and stop. Also the screen would go dark, and I had to remove/reinsert battery to reboot. AT&T; is giving me the run around about replacing it. The warranty dept is experiencing a system error (their exact words) making it impossible to replace the phone. I understand the device failing, I don't understand the warranty dept failing.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "slowest Andriod made, but great for talk/text", "Author": "Aaron", "ReviewID": "RQHFZ3294NYW7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had to write this on here because apparently AT&T; doesnt like people knowing what kind of phone their getting through customer reviews. Also, their GoPhone support is basically non-existant. Spent at least 20 mins cycling through automated menus, only to always ended back up at the same one that basically only lets you check your balance or add money, even after calling a totally different number. Online service is no help either. Try to log in with your phone number and it redirects you to the GoPhone site to log in again. Then just gives you an overview of your account, and if you manage to find the \"Contact Us\" link, it leads you to the main site to log in yet again, only to be kicked back to the abandoned-looking GoPhone site. Repeat cycle.With all that out of the way; this thing only has 256mb of RAM and a super slow processor. I had to root it and download an app to speed up the CPU, and it still barely runs Angry Birds. Angry Birds Space crashes half the time.  But the call quality is really good, which is the point of a phone..texting is nice, except for if you use the Swype keyboard then theres a button between the space and either period or comma that switches it to spanish, then again to Simplified Chinese, that is super easy to accidently push. So if all of a sudden your auto-fill words start popping up as Spanish, that'd most likely be why. I mention I rooted my phone, and you pretty much have to unless you're ok with useless bloatware that takes up literally half your ram. The \"internal SD card\", that I have yet to figure out how to access, is almost full out of the box with stupid stuff like Twitter and Layar. The only way to get rid of it is to root it and download something to go in and forcefully remove it. Even then random stuff like google maps and gmail will keep automatically starting themselves, using valuable resources.  It also has several different programs that do basically the same thing. There was one or two TTS (text-to-speech) programs that were very resource taxing. It takes some trial and exploring to go through and find which programs are actually free, such as google maps, and which are just trials of a paid program, such as Navigator.As far as any kind of entertainment value (i.e apps, video, even pictures), this thing has 0 resources to spare. Even something simple like Fruit Ninja sputters and can be slow (even with the bumped up processor speed). Pictures in the photo gallery take their sweet time loading and are arranged by oldest date first. So if you want to get to recent picures you didnt just take with this phones (fairly lousy) camera, then be prepared to scroll for a while. The scrolling itself is even fairly aggravating, as it will zip to the end if you hold the scroller bar at the bottom, but tends to plop right back to where it was once you let go. Even for a 3.2mp camera, its not great. My Samsung Reality's 2.3mp camera I feel took better pictures.If you go for the 50$ plan thinking its unlimited everything, SmartPhones still require a secondary data package. I dropped down to the 25$ plan after learning that, and suddenly it seems like my WiFi barely works. I dont know if they set up the network like that for some reason or if the phone itself suddenly decided it didnt want to work, but its something to take note of.. oh, and if you turn your data off thinking that you dont want to occur any charges, make sure you turn it back on in order to receive any picture messages.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone, hate the internal memory problem", "Author": "Neko", "ReviewID": "R303QRPQ9P818Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this to replace my old, slow and laggy go phone. I was going to go with a different carrier, but they were sold out. So I bought this phone, I wanted an android. I love to download apps, etc. The internal memory drives me nuts. You can't delete some of the pre-installed programs and I'm not even sure if there is a such thing as upgrading internal memory. I can't upgrade software for same reason. Other then that, it's not bad for people on a tight budget. I hated paying for 2 phones and having a 60-70 phone bill. It's really up to you if you want to buy this phone. I'm on it constantly and it does have periods where you may have to turn off the phone and turn it back on because of some program errors. Wifi I do love and this one has gps and navigator.

I'll be upgrading soon.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I don't like to waste money. And that's exactly what I was doing when I had a typical phone contract. When I switched to the Google Voice/Skype/Gophone setup, I ended up saving about $40 a month and that made me happy. For the longest time, however, that meant enduring communication on a ghetto 1990s phone (the best value I could find for the Gophone). However, when my ghetto phone died recently, I was forced to review the market again and I came across a remarkable gem: the AT&T; Fusion.Not only did it fit well into my money-saving Google Voice/Skype/Gophone scheme, it also had a camera (score!) and was able to handle the internet like my iPod. I went from needing 3 devices when I went out down to just one. It's a testament to the free market that such a product is available for so little moolah. $130 for a small computer that can take pictures and upload them to Facebook. Oh yeah, and it also can make phone calls.There are some serious drawbacks, namely the fact that there's only 200 MB of internal memory on the phone, which is used for apps and text messages. Seriously, we're talking about tera a petabyte devices now; the last I heard of something at the MB level was my Commodore 64 from 1987). If you have too many apps, you can't receive text messages and that's excruciatingly annoying. You can move the apps to the SD card, but that requires some tech-savviness that most consumers don't have the patience for. Also, I had an issue moving my SIM card to this phone from my ghetto `90s one. Text messages didn't come in for a while and it was difficult to figure out what was wrong (AT&T; customer service was actually very good here). I've also had problems with receiving data over the 3G connection.The greatest thing about this device, however, was the brilliant GPS feature. A user can download navigation directions when connected to the Internet, then when driving around the middle of nowhere without a data connection, the navigation app will direct him flawlessly (evidently the GPS feature is free though data would cost).All in all, this is an excellent buy and will only cause a few minor headaches if you're used to more capable devices.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great introduction to smartphones", "Author": "Will O.", "ReviewID": "R17MPUH21OSOP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're looking into getting a smartphone and you've never owned one before, this phone is a great starting point. It's simple to use, easy to root and will allow you to learn the basics of what a more expensive smartphone will offer. Comes with a lot of bloatware but as I said, it is incredibly easy to root. Rooting the phone will allow you to remove most of said bloatware. The few issues I have with it mainly concerns the hardware such as processor speeds and the size of the flash memory. Obviously since this is only a 100$ phone, you're not going to have the latest and greatest hardware. Because of that if you run too many apps you will bog down this phone and it will operate a lot slower than usual. That's why it's important to familiarize yourself with the task manager and stick to only using 2 apps simultaneously. The touch screen is also a little iffy but then again, the phone is only 100$ so it's not going to be on the same level as the S3 or iPhone 5. Either way, I just got this phone yesterday and it's already performed the functions I needed it for such as web browsing, email, twitter, facebook and music. You do not require a data plan to use this phone as it comes with built in wifi that will allow you to connect to any local wifi networks (if you have the credentials to access said networks of course). I will say this though, when you first get it don't rush to put your sim card in. Let it charge for 10 minutes beforehand.

It handles basic apps like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, etc. just fine. Some web pages get dicey given its 600mhz processor. It also went through some growing pains by crashing the dialer and the Android system itself, but it resolved itself after a couple days.The biggest negative has to be the lack of internal storage. You can barely add your own apps without an external SD card, can't move preinstalled apps from the paltry internal storage, and are constantly asked to delete text messages.The price is the only marginally good thing about this phone, but the latest crop of phones are including beefier processors and larger storage for the budget android segment.

I just put cash on it and started using it today.  I can hear the people I'm talking to clearly, but I'm not sure the inverse is true.  Seemed to have to repeat myself alot while on with customer service today.One of the reasons I purchased this phone was because of the WIFI option - didn't opt for a data plan since I have a wireless network at home and work I can use.  However, the connection the phone establishes in my home is unreliable.  My computers are connected with no issue, but the phone can't retain the connection long enought to allow me to do anything online.I'm not thrilled with the sensitivity of the screen.  I generally type with my nails on my touch screens - keeps all the oils from your hands off the screens, but this screen only recognizes a full fingertip pressed on the screen.  Also, fat fingers (something I've never had an issue with before) is a problem as well.  Switched from the Android keyboard to the Vlingo keyboard, and it's preferrable for me, but wish the keyboard with this phone was better.We'll see, maybe I'll change my review after I've used the phone for a full month, but as of today, I'm not impressed with anything but the savings I'll get switching from a $150 a month verizon family plan to a $25 per month per phone pre-paid plan!", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for the price but small space and memory.", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R2CUUO2NKR7MRZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So, I've been wanting to try an android phone for a while now but I wanted a prepaid gophone because I love the 25 dollar plan every 3 months so I went to walmart today and found this one.

Most importantly, this phone has no \"face sensor\" so when you're on a call and you put the phone up to your ear, the screen is still on and it will hang up on whoever you're talking to.  You can push the on/off button to fix this (screen turns off but call stays on) but who wants to have to remember to push extra buttons for something so simple?  Same with hanging up the call (on purpose).  You have to turn the screen back on via the on/off button, and then hang up \"again\" via the touch screen.More issues:-- You have to turn Swype on and off from any keypad to use it (can't just start using it or tapping without changing settings as on other phones).-- The speakerphone volume is so low it's basically useless.  Don't even think about trying to use this in the car!  However, this seems to be similar on other smart phones so maybe this is not specific to this phone.-- Hooking up a Bluetooth headset takes an inordinate number of buttons, clicks, etc.-- The Voice Dial screws up every time.-- Dialing is very difficult because you can't dial from the messaging screen or a few other fairly intuitive places.I'm hoping a lot of these are user error as this is my first smart phone, but that being the case there is no way anyone trying to acclimate to a smart phone from the old kind with buttons will like this phone!  It's too difficult, too unwieldy.  I can't believe they actually got anybody who tested this design to say it was market-worthy!!!!  May I suggest instead the Pantech Crossover, which is laid out very similarly but has features to correct the vast majority of the above.  I bought mine on Amazon and with a $25 plan credit it actually cost $15 LESS than the crappy Fusion.

Besides those few times, however, service works fine. Four stars for reliability.The phone itself is good. Nice clear sound. As a smart-phone it is not powerful enough for many applications. It can go slow when you play Angry Birds or get behind when you use GPS. Power off and restart always makes GPS perfect again.Very limited memory. I only have the most essential applications and songs. Scientific calculator, dictionary and not much space for something else.The price is great!

When you make a call the volume is so low you can barely hear who your talking too without having them repeat what they say over and over again. The speaker phone feature is even worse because it's still to low to hear the person on the other end of the line. You have to purchase separate data in order to surf the web, and if you do the web is very slow. Not user friendly at all. I went to listen to one of the apps downloaded, and then phone just went black. dark lines on the front screen now prevent me from being able to use the phone anymore, and it's now garbage.
