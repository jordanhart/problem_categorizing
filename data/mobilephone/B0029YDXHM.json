When I received the phone I noticed a couple of features stopped working.  O.K. I will admit I got worried.  Returning items bought on the internet can be tricky and sometimes it is just not worth the hassle.  This SELLER was WONDERFUL.  They responded to my e-mail immediately.  I returned the item and they sent a new phone.  Everything is working and I'm very happy with the product and the customer service I received from this seller.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best NON-SMART phone I have ever used", "Author": "E. S. Gowen", "ReviewID": "RCBPMAJ8LCSZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I admit that this phone is inferior to many smart-phones that are currently on the market. Those all, however, require a data plan to use. If you are like me and want a quality phone without having to pay for a data plan then this is the phone for you. I have been using a BlackBerry Pearl for the last 6 years, so I am pretty familiar with its pros and cons.Pros:-Modified qwerty keyboard. While it is not a full qwerty (most of the buttons share two letters) I only commonly run across one mix up (\"see\" and \"are\"). That is a HUGE improvement over 9 key.-A smart phone quality calendar.-Very good media player-Bluetooth-Great Address book options.-Unlimited text inbox space; not the 250-500 text limit that virtually all phones have.-Many text search options. Great for when you are looking for that text you need but can't remember when you got it or who sent it.-Voice dialing-Fits very well into a pocket-Can set any size file as a ringtone, alarm, etc....I could go onCons:-The camera and video camera are not very good. I understand that there are people for whom a phone camera is more important than a calendar or address book or wifi then this is not the phone for you.-Much like a roller ball mouse, every year or so the track ball needs to be cleaned. There are many tutorials online that explain how this should be done. Once cleaned it works like new.I have used many many phones, but this is far and away the best NON-SMART phone I have ever used.

The seller was TABLET DISTRIBUTORS. Even though I click on the link to this item from my past orders, this page now has a different seller. I WOULD NOT recommend buying from this particular seller if this is important to you. Right now, the seller is not a \"fulfilled by Amazon\" one, even though it was at the time I purchased mine and I am extremely disappointed. I usually buy straight from Amazon only (but how else will I get a sweet old Blackberry pearl?).The phone itself is apparently new with plastic cling on all the scratchable parts. It also came with a Blackberry battery and Blackberry charger, and instruction manual. However it didn't come with the pouch!!! They are like $5 but it really should have come with it. Also, the insides of the phone look scratched, which is weird since the outsides look nice. The box is a black unbranded Blackberry box.I'm definitely sending this phone back. I don't care that it's not 100% legit, perhaps, but I really didn't want an unbranded phone, and that's what is apparently supposed to be sold here.
