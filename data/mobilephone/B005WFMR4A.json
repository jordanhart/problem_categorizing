The battery life isn't great (although that's probably because I've been using it a lot since I got it!) and the loud-speaker quality is poor. These are the only reason I didn't give this 5-stars, but otherwise it's fantastic and I'd strongly recommend.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "i wanted this phone", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "R39XCOIWG9A1MW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The numbers and symbols don't match up when pressed.  Thankfully there is a fix but it will take some work.  Everything else works great.  I wish there were more phones with slide out keyboards.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great slider", "Author": "Michael Wynn", "ReviewID": "RVH2MUUQBCHBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One great slider cell phone. Perfect for international travel and business users who prefer a true qwerty keyboard. Plenty of Android apps, excellent camera, and good display and audio features.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Trip to Japan", "Author": "Shianti Lee", "ReviewID": "R2T2YCRHNFFUD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone because I planned to use it on my travels to Japan. My personal phone would not work because Japan and south Korea are 3G UMTS 2100 MHz or 3G CDMA2000 800 MHz, which is not used traditionally in America. I also wanted a phone that would allow me to use it in my other travels as my previous travel phone with sim card slot is outdated. After comparing 5-10 phones, my needs and likely use I settled on this one. I found the phone easy to use and dependable. I did have some issues accessing my e-mails while out and about but that had more to do with the access points in Japan rather than the phone. I loved the ability to transition from video to pictures, then make a call without issue. I am happy to recommend this phone to anyone who wants a qwerty keyboard and a high level multi-us phone.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005WFMR4A"}}
