The 'internet' part of the phone reminds me of a dos program... its really really basic and crappy... but good enough for checking email if you use something like AOL, or just checking the weather.But you arent buying this phone because you want an Iphone 9.  You are buying this phone because you can drop it, dunk it, sit on it, toss it down the stairs, use it as a chew toy or any other number of abusive things you shouldnt do to a phone and it will keep on working.  It took me 3 years to finally break mine after tons of mountain bike crashes, drops, being in water constantly... finally some saltwater got into the charger port which somehow came open and it died.This phone is hardy, period.  Not fancy, but durrable as can be.  Its also loud, the front speaker is great you can hear the speaker phone loud and clear from 10 feet away.Keep in mind there are two versions of this phone, one with a front speaker and one without.  Get the one with the front speaker its better.  I just got the new orange version, with no front speaker and I like the other one better.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "g'zone boulder  toughest phone ever", "Author": "chris", "ReviewID": "RPIQI8HOEQDDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am just amazed at the durability of this phone, i have lost it for 2 days under a foot of snow, dropped in bathtub, and i was removing a transmission from my truck when it suddenly dropped out, the only thing between it and the concrete was the phone, it suppourted the full weight of the trans protecting my hand. and suffered no damage at all!  simply amazing. not to mention i have dropped it many many many times. still tickin like a champ! do not hesitate to grab one if you work in the field.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME!!!

The contact list that was still programmed into it.

The phone also came with two videos: The first of a toliet being flushed with a number two that is way too big to go down (gross, why was this filmed???) The second of a person who was the previous phones owner (I'm guessing) asking his wife what she wants to eat for dinner.3.) Games which are of course Awesome!!!4.) Recordings of phone calls of which I'm too frightened to listen to yet. (Due to the video of someones deuce that refused to go away.)5.) Dukes of Hazard Ringtone. (I work in South Central not sure how well that will go over with the homies)6.) plently of caked on dirt. Although got most of it out of the cracks and crevices with a toothpick.7.)

I've kept this thing intentionally submerged for over an hour, and I've done it many times. It's actually a (stupid) parlor trick that I'll use at a bar or restaurant - order a glass of water on the side, and then plop my phone in it for the duration of my visit to impress my friends. I've also gone to outdoor parties with a 4-ft above-ground swimming pool, and let the kids amuse themselves trying to find it at the bottom of the pool.Want to talk rugged? I've dropped this thing countless times. Hell, I've thrown it across a room on occasion. At worst what might happen is that the battery might come loose - but I've actually only seen that happen when I have the extended-life battery in (which projects outward from the back somewhat, unlike the default battery which sits flush against the back). Some of the plastic portions of the phone are scratched/worn from all the abuse this phone has seen, but that's about the only ill effect it has suffered from all the abuse I've dished out.It has an external bulb on it to support a flashlight function. Not only is this a nice idea, but it also happens to be an incredibly bright bulb (comparatively speaking), making this a very convenient feature.Those are the feathers in its cap. Now let's talk about its black eyes.It's not a smartphone. If you want a smartphone, you need something else.It takes pretty lousy pictures and video.It cannot store many text messages. I mean, I like to save texts that have sentimental value; unfortunately for me, this phone won't save but about 125 or so before complaining about its memory being full. It has severe limitations on how many picture messages it can store as well. I've had phones from 2002 that could store more text messages.The original battery had a horrible battery life. However, to be fair, the extended-life battery has a fan-freaking-fabulous battery life.It has, on occasion, randomly rebooted - and even occasionally locked up - on me. These are incredibly rare events, though.The alarm (as in, the alarm clock feature) stops making noise after about a minute. Not cool.I like a phone that warns me when the battery is low - and then ceases to bug me about it once I acknowledge that I'm aware of the situation. I can't stand hearing a warning sound every five minutes, nor do I like seeing a \"Battery is Low!\" sign whenever I try to glance at the clock. This phone completely fails at the aforementioned pet peeve of mine. Um, Casio, chances are that if I'm *not* plugging in my phone when the battery is low, it's because I *can't* plug it in, so could you please stop bugging me about it? Sure, my battery might be low, but we all know that a low battery is still typically good for at least 60-90 minutes of standby time, and maybe even 5-7 minutes of talk time (which is very possibly what I'm counting on, and the reason that I haven't simply shut the phone off).The built-in compass isn't terribly reliable; it's often right on target, but sometimes it's 180-degrees off, even after I do the figure-eight thing that's supposed to reinitialize its sense of direction. I'd be terrified to actually have to count on it in an emergency.It has an external button on the left-hand side that's supposed to be for playing music (i.e. using the phone as an MP3 player). I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally hit that button when trying to adjust my phone volume. It's a really bad design, and I think they just stuck that on there to try to compete with older-generation iPhones.It has horrible (pretty much unusable) volume when used with Bluetooth devices. You might think that this must be a problem with the Bluetooth device but no, I've tried it with a couple, and had the same result. When used with a *different* phone, the Bluetooth devices worked fine. And these were Bluetooths (Blueteeth?) that I actually bought from the Verizon store, guaranteed to be compatible (loosely speaking, apparently) with my Boulder.And that's all I have.So yeah, in summary... about the most rugged phone you can possibly imagine, and definitely the one you want to have if you're out in the elements.

While it had a charge it worked great, unfortunately the charging cable came apart on first use.Monster Utopia was excellent and sent a replacement charger, unfortunately it also broke upon first(very careful) use because of a manufacturing defect in the charger port in the phone.  Fortunately they are taking it back, good service from Monster Utopia.Something slipped through quality control to have such a fundamental problem as a defective charging port.

This is the second G'zOne Phone that I have owned The exact same problems were present on the first phone, but since I bought it used I thought it was just old and worn out.  I was sold on the rugged construction, which I admit, did hold up.

Well, after a day running around on the training range and making my way through some water obstacles, this phone failed to do what it said it could do.  The phone went underwater only about 6 inches for around 2 minutes, when I pulled it out of my cargo pocket at the end of the day the screen had water behind it and the battery compartment was soaked.  The phone is rugged and can take a beating; however, do not get it wet.

No one can hear me.  Not a good thing for a communication devise. I heard that the speaker is in the hinge where a human hand would normally hold the phone, and this positioning blocks the speaker from being heard.  Ergonomically incorrect imho.  I guess the human hand, and mouth, were not taken into consideration when designing this phone.2.  Short battery life. The frequent sound of the battery dying is ingrained in my brain.3.  The screw that opens up the battery compartment with the use of a coin is NOT METAL even though it appears to be so at first.  The real (hard) metal coin eventually wins over the (soft) screw.  Can you believe it is siver-coated green PLASTIC?How can this possibly be up to Military specifications?  If a military person is out in the field and doesn't have time to sit around while the battery charges, s/he will soon be unable to change batteries at all as the nonmetal screw quickly disintegrates.Duck tape anyone?", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "E-Compass.
