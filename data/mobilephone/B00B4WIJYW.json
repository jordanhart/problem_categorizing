The actual screen is small. The graphics on the phone are horrible, the phone barely works using just your fingers, you have to use the stylus pen if you want to take advantage of the touch screen. The phone constantly freezes. The camera quality is abysmal, you can barely see anything! The phone is not durable at all. The plastic on the back of the phone scratches very easily, so if you are clumsy, I don't recommend this phone. You can't connect to WIFI. The phone has TERRIBLE battery life and the call quality is horrible. YES, The phone is cheap, but it's not worth the money.In all, I only gave it 1 star because that's the minimum rating you can give the product. It may be cheap, but ultimately, it will be a waste of your money.
