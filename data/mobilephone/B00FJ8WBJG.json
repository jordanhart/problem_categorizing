{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone, has good call quality, and more features and processing grunt than you know what to do with...", "Author": "instantstupor \"Instantstupor\"", "ReviewID": "RFT6BXW5F2Q99", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATED 11/12/2013I know I may not appear a \"Verified Buyer\", but I purchased this phone through our primary's Amazon account. I most certainly do own this device. With that out of the way, here are my thoughts after a week of ownership. Also, if you have questions, go ahead and ask. I'll answer them as time allows - I know what it is like to plop down 250 bucks on something and not know that ONE thing you just can't find out about it anywhere. Anyways, on to my impressions.First of all, I did not have this phone prior to the update that was issued to fix call quality. I cannot say for certain the update fixed it, as I never experienced the problem, but what I can tell you is that while I've used it (I immediately installed the update when I got the phone), all the calls I've made have been crystal clear both on my end and on the the callers end. So if that was a worry for you, I would say you can cross that off the list now.Let's quickly talk about who this phone isn't for. Go ahead and skip this section if you are a tech head like me and already poured over tech specs and sheets well before it released. This phone is, unquestionably, huge. It is able to be HELD with one hand, but it's usefulness one handed is somewhat limited. I'm a 6'0 tall guy, slightly above average sized hands. I use Thumb Keyboard as my replacement for stock, and I cannot easily reach the left hand side of the keyboard. It can be done, but it requires some finagling in the hand (that incidentally has it resting precariously on the tips of my fingers near the center of the back of the device). Using the \"one handed operation\" setting within Thumb Keyboard (or stock for that matter) squashes it to to the side and one handed typing can be accomplished easier that way. But there are plenty of buttons still out of reach. Any keys on the top, for example the Search button on the top of the Play Store, is impossible to reach with your thumb one-handed. You also can't easily reach the capacitive menu button (located to the left of the home button) while operating one handed. The latter two are obnoxious to say the least. So long as you plan to use it mostly with two hands - hold it in one and touch with the other) - usability is perfectly fine.Given that, I can't recommend this phone to anyone who truly wants a phone that can be fully operated one handed. The absolute tips of the scale in terms of one handed operation that I can recommend would be the HTC One (that is what the other two people on my plan got - also great phones) with their 4.7 inch screens. The Note 3 also hase has an incredible amount of power. It will crunch through anything you throw at it, but it is rather overkill at the moment. If you want a future proof level set of internals, this phone certainly fits the bill. But if you are basically going to take phone calls, do some texting, emailing, web browsing and casual gaming, this will be overkill. You can easily get away with the HTC One (or phones of its ilk) with it's previous gen Snapdragon 600 processor.I'll keep the rhetoric to a minimum and get down to brass tacks afterwards. You've probably read a million reviews on this phone already trying to determine if you'll pull the trigger so you don't need me to wax poetical. This phone, aside from it's still somewhat underwhelming construction (it's not cheap, just not HTC One typed premium), is nearly perfect in every other category. The screen is fantastic -  I leave mine set to about 35% brightness and that seems to be the sweet spot for me between readability and power-usage. The ear-piece speaker is pretty good, though not great. Same can be said for the external loudspeaker, but at least it is in fact loud (you can even press a button on the upper right hand side of the stock dialer for \"Extra Volume\"). I don't care for it's placement though. It's not ideal for directionality, but it is also placed in such a way that my hand covers it when I hold the phone in landscape orientation for gaming and video watching. That is one of the only knocks I have against it actually.Going back to its internals - its Snapdragon 800 processor, Adreno 330 GPU and 3 gigabytes of RAM are all incredibly powerful top tier components. It's basically overkill. I noticed while playing games that the phone would get hot - borderline excessively so - after 5 plus minutes of gaming. That was true of games ranging from Plants vs Zombies 2 to Modern Combat 4. I decided to enable \"Power Saving Mode - CPU Power Saving\" - something I basically never do on anything ever. I want it to perform above and beyond. But I can say that this phone doesn't see any ill effects from enabling this in day to day performance, or in gaming. I do gather it only limits the CPU clock and not the GPU clock, but it saves you a bit of energy AND keeps the phone cool even after fairly decent length gaming sessions. The framerate on PvZ2, Modern Combat 4, NOVA 3 and others all remained consistently high. In fact, I ran the Epic Citadel benchmark with settings on \"Ultra High Quality\" and \"100% Rendering Resolution Percentage\" and got 54-55 FPS whether I left the CPU Power Mode checked or unchecked. So given that, until I find a task that needs it, I'll be keeping this \"power saving\" feature on - I'd suggest you probably do the same.One handed operation is also aided by the fact that you can dig into the Settings menu, under the Controls tab and find One-handed Operation. Here you can enable \"use for all screens\" which will allow you to use a quick left to right swipe gesture from the edge of the screen to minimize the window down to a fraction of the screen. I use this the few times I want to reach the top-most corners of the screen one handed (or the menu button, as virtual keys for the main buttons also show up in this windowed mode).I would also suggest grabbing \"Folder Organizer\" by Fabio Collini. It allows you to group things into folders where you can change the layout to be a list with icons and text (a scrollable list that you can select individual items across a row encompassing nearly the width of the screen making one handed selection very easy). It has other benefits, I've been using it for ages. Makes changing individual app shortcut icons very easy as well.I've found battery life on this device to be well under what I've read in professional reviews. They struggle to kill the battery in a 24 hour period. With a 3200 milliamp battery in this beast, I'd imagine it should be. And still, I find myself looking at the battery stats and seeing 3 hours of screen time and 12 hours of up time with around 20% battery remaining fairly regularly. How power users stretch the Note 3 to have over 24 hours (and some cases closer to 36-48 hours) is beyond me. I turn off features I don't need, keep the brightness down, keep my wireless radios in check - all for naught. It will definitely get you through a work day, but if you are going to be away from an outlet for 12+ hours, I'd be a bit antsy if I've done any medium to heavy usage that day. In standby mode, you'll get plenty of life out of the battery though. I do wonder if there were some ill effects to battery life after the update to address call quality - the discrepancy in battery life seems a bit too drastic and stark in comparison.The S-pen is nice, I will certainly use it, but I wouldn't let it sway you if it was going to dissuade you from getting another phone/phablet. Clearly if you need finite control in certain applications for work or what have you, the stylus on this thing cannot be beat. It does do handwriting quite well and it's pin point precision allows for very fine drawing - not pencil/pen level, but very good nonetheless. I'll also take this opportunity to touch on the \"pen-window\" functionality. It's limited app selection makes it less appealing in practice than it sounds in theory. I like to use it to have quick access to a Google Hangouts chat window, or maybe a web browser. This also goes for the \"mutli-screen\" mode. The fact only a fraction of your apps will support either makes this really killer multitasking feature fairly useless. Until they give us access to all our apps via these methods (already done via custom ROMs so it's clearly possible, just restricted by Samsung), it's largely gimmicky. Useful sometimes, but you'll more than likely end up in my shoes - using it because it's there when you get the phone and then never using it again. It's just that limited.One other thing to note is the expandable SD storage is good for files and such, but don't expect to be moving apps over to it. I have a ton of games and other apps that command large file sizes. If you try to use \"move to SD card\", you'll be able to...but the kicker is that the SD card in this device is actually an emulated one - it simply sees your internal storage as the SD card. You cannot move items to the external SD card, which is a bummer to me. I still have a ton of apps, and you get around 25 gigs for app storage, so it's not like you are limited. But it is a con I didn't anticipate, and imagine others may find this restriction a bit too limiting for their needs.In any event, there are my kind of rambling thoughts on the phone. As I continue to use the phone, I will probably come back and add to the review and update or correct my opinions as I have more time under my belt with this juggernaut. Hope there were some useful bits in there - and your fears about voice quality have been assuaged.

Johnson \"Zepaw\"", "ReviewID": "R29855AD1JULQU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a fan of the bigger sized phones for some time and Samsung has been paving the way in terms of quality large phones. I remember when I had the 4.5in screened Samsung Infuse and it was considered large. I've had a Note and Note 2 and loved both. Note 3 continues the tradition of keeping everything that worked, improving where needed, and adding features I wouldn't have even thought to ask. So many of the little annoyances I had with my Note 2 have been addressed.  Its clear they put a lot of thought into finding out what people loved and wanted changed.When I first held the phone I fell in love. The form factor is just great and the screen is a noticeable jump up. That's saying something when the Note 2 already had a stellar screen resolution. I don't feel the need to have this one in a case. The slippery back of the Note 2 required a case as I dropped it a couple times when holding it bare.Rather than go on feature by feature I'll suffice to say everything feels like a great and noticeable improvement. S-pen, camera, screen, on and on its the phone I loved before but better in every way I could have asked for. I've tried dozens of smartphones over the past 5 years. The Note 2 was the first one I actually held onto for a year. I easily see myself holding onto the 3 that much or longer (depending on when they bring out a 4th ;) ).I highly recommend this phone.*Update a week in. I'm still just as impressed with this phone if not more so. The biggest thing I've found since my review is how much battery this phone offers. The battery size is insignificantly larger than the Note 2 which means they really improved the performance greatly to have increased battery efficiency this much. With the Note 2 most days of average us (lots of music streaming but not much else) I'd be about out of battery by end of work 5pm-ish. Now I'm at around 50%. I can make it through a full day without charge using the phone a good amount throughout. I did a test a couple days ago purposefully trying to drain it as fast as possible. Screen on high brightness near continuously while downloading several GB of data over 4G and it lasted over 6 hours! I remain extremely happy I got this phone.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Note - Aptly Named for A Life Companion", "Author": "Barredbard", "ReviewID": "R3DQ87JE1GZGTQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Background: This will not be a technical review, even though I am a bit of a \"techie\" who has forfeited dinner on many a night in order to afford a favored electronic gadget. The specs are easily found on the box, or the instructions manual. A comparison of platforms and operating systems is almost inevitable. If you just prefer to read about the Note 3, please scroll down to that sub-heading.War of the Platforms: Smartphones are indispensable. I realized the truth of this when I lost my virginity (figuratively) to my first Blackberry phone. In law school, when I was impoverished and dining on sardines when I could catch them, my Blackberry phone with its modest specifications served as my sole conduit to the internet at home. A smartphone is a game changer for the simple fact that it can serve as the key to any individual's personal and corporate 'empire,' simultaneously. Whether it was responding to emails, using Skype to call family members abroad, storing passwords in the password saver or - yes - making calls, smartphones brought a level of convenience that was previously only accessible while confronting the glare of a computer monitor. The intervening years have seen the rise of iPhones, the demise of Blackberry phones and the predominance of Android phones; a sort of electronic coup d'\u00e9tat. In many ways, Blackberry (formerly RIM) had the right idea. Their flagship phones arrived replete with leather holsters in the box. Their phones were precisely and lovingly tooled. A flagship Blackberry phone exuded sophistication, elegance, and a place of pride with the \"in crowd.\" But Blackberry was so captivated by its own glory that it ignored the iPhone, which was quietly making inroads with smartphone users. The iPhone was easy to ignore for users like myself who were more focused on the practical aspects of a smartphone, and were entirely content with the jack of all trades that a Blackberry phone represented.In those yesteryears, the iPhone seemed more focused on media consumption, and since Blackberry phones could also play music tracks and movies - albeit without as much flourish as the former - diehard Blackberry enthusiasts could afford to ignore it. In time, this became impossible, because Blackberry had become so complacent that the iPhone had, overnight it seems, become a more useful corporate tool than Blackberry. Having watched in envy as my coworkers set up corporate emails on their iPhones without the hassles faced by Blackberry users without specialized software, I made the decision that it was time to flirt with a different platform. My first droid phone was Sprint's EVO. The screen was huge, and the included kickstand did little to soften that overall impression. The deal breaker was the battery which struggled so hard to power the immense screen and the fledgling Android operating system that it could only give about 5 hours of power with minimal use. I promptly returned it. My next foray into the Droid world was with the Photon 4g; a fairly decent phone, but manufacturing glitches made me return that as well. I completed the experience with trying out the Note 2 earlier this year for two weeks. I ultimately returned that as well. In each instance, after returning the phone, I bought a new Blackberry, up until last year when I finally bought the iPhone 5. I was no stranger to, and no fan of iOS - I have both an iPad and an iPod, but I was beguiled by stories of fabled battery life. I was sorely disappointed. So disappointed that I paid the $700 retail price for the Note 3 on the very first day it came out, which now leads me this review . . .The Note:First Appearances: Oh yes, the phone is notable, no question about it. It is huge, and while I realize that the size is the whole appeal for some there is no getting around the inconvenience of holding that  5.7 inch electronic mammoth to an ear for making a call. Which is its primary function, after all. I am no ogre; I have medium hands, and two-handed operations rule with this device. I am also digging my Jawbone Bluetooth headset out of retirement.  This incarnation is actually both thinner and lighter than the Note 2. Still, I would have preferred a narrower, shorter phone, with the stylus. For now, I carry it in my coat pocket, while I wait for the slew of cases to hit the market. The phone features a faux leather backing with stitching all around it. It is tacky, but it works, and may even seem elegant from certain vantage points. It is better by leaps and bounds than the plastic looks of the Note 2.  I have long disdained Samsung products for the simple reason that the company has no concept of style. Its phones - especially of late - actually have some really innovative ideas and groundbreaking software, but are housed in the cheapest-looking hardware to be found. Plastic is great for toothbrushes and combs. Not so much for mobile phones.The hardware: The Note 3 comes in either 32GB or 64GB. I opted for the former since, unlike Apple's monopolistic tendencies, Samsung permits users to add an SD card up to 64 GB for extra capacity. The box comes with some a white set of headphones which work quite well for making and taking calls. However, thanks to Samsung's thoughtlessness, I will not be using it for work since the color is rather loud.  The set itself features a very powerful 13 megapixel camera, and a front-facing 2 megapixel camera for chats and self-portraits. It also features several convenience buttons embedded in silver on the device: a volume button, a power button which can also be used to silence the phone, and a home button. The USB 3.0 jack is somewhat disconcerting since at first blush it looks like it is incompatible with a regular micro USB cord. But never fear, a standard micro USB cord will charge the phone, albeit at a lesser speed than the included USB 3.0 cord. Depress the home button twice, and Samsung's Siri junior will be ready to take orders. It is not as sassy or as useful as Siri on the iPhone, but I do not regret the divorce. As promised, technical details are not discussed at any length, but the phone is blazing fast.The battery: This deserves its very own section, as this is one area where this phone truly excels. A cellphone is only as good as its battery. The iPhone was a bitter disappointment for me. 6 hours of moderate use was enough to drain the battery to the point that charging was necessary. In fairness, my experience does not appear to be typical, since two co-workers can go all day on their iPhones. Sprint's lackluster network connection means that my phones constantly search for network connection, especially indoors, and I imagine that wreaks havoc on the battery. The Note 3 cannot be beaten for battery life on the Sprint network. I only need to charge it after 12 to 15 hours of moderate to heavy use; enough for complete liberation from a charger while at work. This feature is critical for me; a lawyer must have a device with a powerful enough battery to survive a day spent in court away from the office.The software: Samsung has matured as a software developer. Although many of its software applications and innovations on the phone appear little more than gimmicks, the Note 3 is replete with a profusion of software that a user will doubtlessly appreciate. The camera comes in many clever modes. There's the Knox application which either allows the IT department at any office to isolate office information from personal information, or which just allows the user to deposit media files and such to a secured location that requires a password for access. There's the screen mirroring which allows one to `mirror' anything on the Note 3's screen on a different device like on a computer monitor or flat screen TV. There's the remote control application that permits the user to quickly and easily program the phone to serve as a remote for all electronic devices including the cable box, DVD/Blue Ray Player and TV. The remote application even allows different remotes within the application for different rooms. Flicking a finger from the bottom of the phone upwards presents an amalgamation of news events. Waving a hand over the phone while it is sleeping reveals stats such as the time, missed phone calls, emails and texts; a subtle enhancement. Depressing a tab to the left of the screen produces a menu from which a user can select two seperate apps for simultaneous viewing. Using this feature, for example, one can fire off an email while browsing the internet, or watching a youtube video on the same screen at the same time. The tab can be moved to the right of the screen if it proves to obtrusive, or can be gotten rid of all together by pressing the back button.The  Stylus: The stylus, for me, is not a gimmick. I am forgetful, and jotting down quick notes on my phone is an added boon. Pulling out the pen activates the `Air Command' feature; a fan shaped menu that presents a variety of options, to wit: Action memo, Scrap booker, Screen Write, S-finder and Pen Window. Action memo had the most potential, but Samsung crippled it by not allowing the flexibility to manipulate notes in any manner. For example, writing down a number and name will allow you to save it contacts. Writing down an email address will allow you to quicky send an email to that address. But I cannot write a quick note, cut and paste it into an email, and fire it off. For that, I would need the 'S Note' application which is a much better option from a practical standpoint, but which is not featured in the Air Command menu.Advantages: The main advantages this phone enjoys over the iPhone particularly are: 1) Removable battery, which is not to be taken lightly; it is disheartening to find so many makers towing Apple's line and making batteries that cannot be removed from the phone. This eliminates the option of swopping the battery if it becomes weak or if it is drained during travel; 2) A standard micro USB will charge it; 3) An SD card will increase its capacity. An added advantage (over other phones but not the iPhone) is its potential use as an international phone. There was a brief scare when it appeared that Samsung had hamstrung the device by only making it usable in the region purchased. For Samsung, this would have been equivalent to purchasing a high caliber pistol, taking careful aim, and shooting itself in the foot. Samsung has since clarified that it only requires that the phone be first activated in the region that it was purchased, and then it would be possible to use SIM cards from other regions. This fact still generates resentment, as it should, since when one purchases a phone, one expects to be able to use it wherever he or she pleases. Another annoyance is that after hitting 'talk' in answering a call, the device still asks whether you will accept the call or send it to voice mail. This unexpected step has caused me to miss a few calls, and I have yet to figure out how to deactivate it.Final Impressions: The phone handles calls with clarity and is blazingly fast. It is by no means 'the Blackberry experience' I previously described. Until Samsung learns that consumers like both form and function in a device, it will never maximize its full potential. Their devices have been entirely lacking the appeal that would render their devices the iconic artifacts that iPhones are. The Note 3 is close to being an exception to the rule; as garish as its fake leather might seem, it is still the best looking of their devices. My main gripe is the sheer size of the phone. Most would appreciate a more manageable form factor, narrower in width and perhaps shorter in length.The Bottom line: The Note has matured into a flagship phone, able to take in corporate and personal life with equal alacrity. Its powerful and removable battery will make it a favorite choice of intrepid travelers, and its huge screen allows it to bridge a gap previously unnoticed between phones and tablets. I will edit this article in days to come.Update: I have to revise my earlier opinion on call quality, and dock the Note 3 a point for that. Having had the phone almost two weeks now, I have noticed that on the aggregate, call quality is mediocre to poor on this phone. Some calls are plagued by intrusive background noise. Unlike some other users, though, I have yet to drop a call on it. Very disappointing for an otherwise stellar phone.

One of the reviewers alluded to the fact that their S2 Epic Touch was basically unusable for GPS/Location services along with a host of other problems. This is true because I had the same issues. When the phone was upgraded to Jellybean from Gingerbread, battery life was 2-3 hours and there's tons of information online about how Sprint and Samsung basically failed to support that phone and/or fix it's issues.I ended up selling it and bought a Photon which served me well until I got a S3. The S3 was great and I passed along to a family member when I got the Note 2. The Note 2 was by far the BEST phone I'd ever used. It eliminated my need for a tablet and I pretty much turned on my laptop in the rare instance that I needed a full 15 inch screen for work. That's how good the phone was, with amazing battery life, solid performance, and an absolutely reliable background. The only thing that disappointed me was the screen resolution...it was good, but it wasn't great when I compared it next to the HTC One or S4.I was so excited for the Note 3 that I sold my Note 2 for $400 and bought the Note 3 off contract for $700. I figured the $300 I was paying was equal to what I would have paid if I had an upgrade that was available. Initially I was in awe of this device. It was everything that the Note 2 was, but improved. I rarely make calls because I usually use messaging so I didn't expect anything to be wrong with the most basic part of the phone. This past week, I've had to make quite a few phone calls for work and that's when I noticed the problems. I looked up, \"Sprint Note 3 call problem\" and ran into a slew of forums and websites stating this issue.On one Android specific site, the reviewer even said that during his review period, the phone made flawless calls. Just this past week, he hasn't been able to make any calls.This may be a software/network issue but Sprint seems to be completely dropping the ball. There's no reassurance to the people who bought this phone and they strangely deleted a thread on their own community forum that they started, which basically said they were looking into the matter. Now, why would they go through the trouble to post that, and then delete it the next day?This is a fantastic device, but it's not a phone. A phone is something you can make and receive calls with. As it currently stands, you can't with this version of the Note 3. Check online and research before you buy this.

I know many people do a limited amount of voice calling on their phones so this may not be much of an issue for some. I use the phone for business so this problem makes the phone unusable for me. During calls you will hear popping noises, modulation, and sound distortion. I can't keep asking my clients to repeat everything they say. I replaced my original phone but the second phone has the same problem.I would rate this phone excellent if this problem could be resolved.

Wow! What a device! After fully setting up my N3 I was hearing a clicking every 60 +/- secs. and prepared to return it as defective. When I did the factory reset in preparation, I also did a cache wipe. After rebooting I decided to try it again before sending back. After initial re-setup the clicking sound was gone - perhaps an app phoning home - and my phone is perfect! I love everything about this device and look forward to using it more and more as I learn it. This is the phone I always wanted and the best one I've ever owned.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I waited until I knew a Sprint update for the call issues was imminent and then purchased. OOB my phone had mi3 firmware and the call, garbling issue. Updated it all the way to mj4 and there was a significant improvement. Not perfect but doable. Did a cache clear and the sound is near perfect.Great phone with many surprises, good and bad. Fortunately the good tips the scale heavily. Still learning about it and enjoying the phone immensely.

I keep my phone in airplane mode and use Wi-Fi or get a cheap phone card.]First, I am not affiliated with Samsung in any way, nor do I work for a cell phone store. I am a writer though.Secondly, I hate long reviews with the poster just reports the specs you already have. Rather, these comments show why the Galaxy Note 3 is more technologically advanced, and more phone for your money, compared to the many good phones on the market today. As for those phones that only show an app screen. I call them cave phones.1. The beautiful 5.7\" Super Amoled HD display has a \"Wow!\" factor. Everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080P, 386 PPI. Despite a few good contenders, no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color, and deep blacks. Check it out for yourself. For those who prefer drab, you can even adjust color intensity and contrast.Is this practical? You bet. You get more viewable data for all social networking apps; you can see more email and contacts without scrolling; browsing is quick and pages more visible; YouTubes and video are fantastic; games are more playable; you can see larger areas on GPS maps; you get a better view of radar in weather; (live) wallpapers look great; you can use it as a reader; you can multitask with it; and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it. I will never go back to a small screen phone. This phone is a joy to use.2. The CPU (For US versions) is the quad core Qualcomm snapdragon 800 @ 2.3, which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time. It will perform well for years to come. A few other phones have it. No lag on this baby. Just try to do things to outpace it. It moves data faster than you can see. Partially because of #3.3. The Adreno 330 GPU is the best on the market, a few other phones have it. Graphics are amazing. It is 50% faster than the Adreno 320 in the Galaxy S4 which is a screamer.4. It's the only phone to come with 3 GB of DDR 3 RAM. It also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage and you can add more with an SD card. Note: No extra charges for these!5. It has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software, a BSI Sensor, Smart Digital Stabilization and high CRI LED. Very few phones have this. It is also the only phone to do 4K video right now - sharp! It also does 1080P video at 60 FPS which is great.6. No other phone has USB 3.0. 2 advantages: the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable. File transfer times are faster. With USB 3.0, a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the Note 3 to my (high end) PC. With USB 2.0 the same file takes 57 seconds.7. How many phones have an S Pen? Except for email and quick notes, I seldom used the S Pen on my original Galaxy Note, but the Note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional, and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate.8. How many phones have a huge 3200 mA battery? It easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen. Hardware CPU and GPU improvements, as well as Android 4.3 make the 100 mA bump over the Note 2 even more significant. You can also open the back and change out the battery - unlike some phones.9. It does infrared remote control. It also has TV-out (via MHL A/V link), Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, and gesture sensor. I'm serious people, you get more for your money.10. Hello multitasking! The fast CPU & GPU, extra memory, and high-resolution 5.7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone. You can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen. This is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth or USB, and connect through HDMI to your TV or computer monitor. The Note 3 can actually serve as a small computer. How many phones can do that? You can also mirror the phone screen with your smart TV for internet, games, viewing pics, whatever.11. This the best cell phone for gaming on the market , period. The above features and OpenGL 3.0 which is part of Android 4.3 make it happen. Don't believe me? Read the reviews, watch the you tubes, and compared it for yourself.12. It doesn't just have GPS, it also uses A GPS (improved), and Glonass Satellites. DL a GPS satellite app, and you'll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location.13. Got Knox? No, you don't. This phone provides business enterprise, and government level security for boot, VPN, etc., and comes in handy for privacy on public Wi-Fi. You don't have to use it, but it is there.14. The air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic. How many phones do that?15. Is the screen too large for one handed operation? Yes, but so what? The tradeoff is worth it. Besides, Samsung now includes software to shrink it for one-handed so you get the best of both worlds.16. I have been using the original Galaxy Note, which is actually wider, wearing suit pants to jeans. Both phones fit fine in your pocket. Don't worry about it unless you wear skinny jeans.17. The TouchWiz UI is fine, and superfast now, but I prefer a 3rd party launcher - Go Launcher EX from the play store. Over a million users. So, the launcher is not a deciding factor in phone purchase for any Android manufacturer.There are a few things that Samsung needs to improve in my opinion. I don't know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient for users. The Note 2 placement was better but still wrong.I do like the new speaker placement though. Its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user. However, there should be two of them or a better one. It is Ok, just not great like the rest of the phone.This phone should also be waterproof right out-of-the-box. Not a scaled-down version, just waterproof the thing. Other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones. That means Samsung can do it too. Truth be known, we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof. It's doable, so please do it. Smoke it with that nano-whatever waterproofing stuff. You went to CES.All that said, I'm very happy, with the Note 3. IMHO the Note 3 is so powerful and functional, it is the first device I would classify as a hand held computer. As a professor, I researched it for days and used the original Galaxy Note for over a year now. There are other good phones, but the Note 3 does it in one package, and in most cases does it better, for the same flag-ship- phone price. I feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising hype who don't research the market. They pay top dollar but don't get their money's worth. Amazon is a great place to get your money's worth and to find out user information. Thanks Amazon.Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it's a really good phone too.Recommendation - get a case for any phone, one that raises a bevel on the front glass, and try to find a good one and screen protector will help as well.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I have ever owned", "Author": "M.

I ordered a Palm Centro until I was due for an upgrade which was this August. At that time, the S4 had come out but I was waiting for the much rumored Note 3. Now a few weeks after its launch and release, I can say that I am pleased that I have waited. I waited a few weeks to ensure I had a case before taking delivery and purchased the phone through BestBuy Mobile. BestBuy price matched the price you see (249.99, down from 324.99 in Kansas).Having used a Galaxy S2, the phone call quality is about the same. Not any worse and not any better - it is just satisfactory and does its job.  I have NOT, repeat, NOT experienced the terrible phone call quality that people are talking about -  I could not ask for a better quality as it sounds just perfectly fine (on both ends). Using my Palm Centro replacement these past 7-8 months, I can say that this Note 3 phone certainly shows improvement but in general, has very clear quality and my friends on the receiving end also enjoy a better quality phone call.What you see with these terrible reviews must be a on a case by case basis or is Sprint Service related (not the phone). Realize that if the phone does not work to your standards you have time to return the phone. Regardless, this phone has been a joy to use. I can view documents, internet, etc with ease. The S-pen, which I do not use much, is supposedly more functional and has more options. the Stylus secures tight into the body, the back cover is nice, the screen resolution is amazing, the speed of the phone is blazing. there are so many options that you might need to ask google to solve settings that best serve you but all in all, the past week has been a great one with the new Note 3.If you were planning to get this phone but are on guard, do not STOP from buying it. I have seen some of the same reviewers on here bashing this phone as I have seen on the sprint website. You need to let the warranty do its magic.

The battery life is the best I've experienced in a smartphone, considering I'm a moderate to heavy user of nearly all it's functions. The pen and software works exceptionally well for creating scrapbooks, notes (two different note apps), drawings and actually illustrating your point on whatever background you currently have up whether it be a photo you just took or the phone's home screen. I've used different pens with different writing programs on the iPad and I must say, Samsung really nailed it with their pen and software, far trumping the iPad's note taking ability. The call quality is clear, however, Sprint's cellular network leaves much to be desired. The phone does have the ability to use WiFi to place and receive calls, although I have not utilized it as of yet. Samsung gives a lot of extras with this phone as they did with the Galaxy S4. Some of the extras are a little gimmicky while others, if not most, are very helpful when fully understood and practiced, giving the device an extra cool factor. The screen, as most others have said, is simply amazing. In just about all lighting situations it remains sharp, clear and crisp, making it that much easier to stay productive and maybe even have fun while doing it. The engineers at Samsung made provisions for the small handed folk by adding features to their software allowing adjustability to most of the main screens one would interface with.

I was torn between this phone and the S4, so I got myself the Note 3 while upgrading my parents to the S4. I first opened up the box and I saw the screen. My first thought was how in thecworld am I going to carry this phone in my pocket. So I turned it on, activated it with no problems.I am a Note 10.1 owner (2012 model), so I knew about S Pen and its functionalities,  but the screen is clearer than my tablet, more colors, more vibrant. Downloaded 50 apps in 10 minutes,  the 4GLTE is blazing fast, quad processor, 3GB RAM, 32GB internal storage (25 usable WITH app to sd card transfer, meaning more space) and 4.3 jelly bean.I haven't done too much to it yet, as I am trying to restore stuff onto the Note, but I am very impressed so far, this is by far an iPhone killer...EDIT: 11/19/2013- After having it for about 3 weeks I noticed a few issues that turned out to be a defective unit. Not really upset because amazon took care of this issue right away, and they are sending me another one. However, due to this issue, it does go down 1 star from 5 to 4. At this point NOTHING is worse than my HTC EVO 3D, which is why I am not complaining too much. As far as the issues, had difficulty keeping applications onto the microSD card, as if I transferred apps on to it and restarted the phone, the phone would be stuck on the sprint logo. I thought a reformat of the phone would do the trick. On Sunday night (11/17/2013), I was texting a friend when out of nowhere my phones display turns off, but not the touchpad lights. So I clicked the sleep wake button twice, screen would not come on. I did a battery pull (thankfully Samsung decides to keep a removable battery in their phones), and my display works, but I have the left side of the display is bright, the right is dim. Called amazon and expecting my new note 3 Thursday, was told I could get a different phone, but even with the sprint spark on the other phones, that doesn't exactly buy me off of this remarkable phone. This phone has so many features that others do not have, and touchwiz is much better than what HTC has on their home screens now. Comparing to all the issues I also had with my HTC EVO 3D, I didn't want to try HTC again anyway. I was looking into the LG G2, but what stopped me from wanting that was no microSD card slot and no removable battery.

The resolution is second to none and the battery life is the best i've ever had on a smart phone. Additionally the touch interface is very responsive, more so than the previous Note 2. Moreover, it is also quicker than the Note 2 when bringing up apps and running apps. But, there are a few things that the Note 3 lacks in that the Note 2 had. One is that although the camera for the Note 3 is 13 megapixels and the Note 2, 8 mega pixels, the Note 2 seems to take better quality pictures. Further, the Note 2 had better low light visibility in the pictures as well. And, the camera view point seems to be more zoomed in at the furthest level from zoom on the Note 3 making me have to take a few steps extra backward to take a picture that I wouldn't have to do with the Note 2. Secondly, the video quality in low light lacks adjustment that the Note 2 had. In the Note 2, one could take a video without the flash and still decipher whats in the video pretty well. But, in the Note 3 even in a slightly dim room you cannot see what is going on in the video which makes talking videos from the phone quite frustrating. I don't know why Samsung took a step back on the camera on the Note 3 by taking away lowlight settings and replacing it with a auto adjust feature on the camera that is supposed to adjust to the different light conditions on its own. Which, it does not do very well might I add. But with that being said, the camera is not horrible, its rather on the better side of smart phone cameras. Another thing is the speaker phone isn't as loud as the Note 2's. That was something that I really enjoyed on the Note 2. Overall though, the phone is probably the best phone I've ever had and I've had the iPhone 4, 4s, and 5 along with the Note 2. The visual aspect of the display is awesome and the default storage is 32 gigs with additional 64 gigs addable storage potential. And, I appreciate the fact that one can take the back off and replace a battery or get extra batteries to charge on the side and replace when needed. In the end I'll rate the phone a 9/10 the only complaint being the camera functioning. Oh, and I have Sprint for my carrier for almost 10 years and I live in the LA area and have lived in many parts of NorCal and SoCal and in New York City and have never had a problem with reception.  I also drove across the country with a few friends who have AT&T; and Verizon and I consistently had more service coverage than they did, as we had to constantly use my phone for GPS service in rural areas because their phones would get no reception at all.

I thought it was a near perfect phablet, except for just two main areas for improvement: Screen resolution/sunlight legibility, and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed. Now that I have the Note 3, things are getting very very interesting....Lets do this review by bulletin points for easier viewing:PROS:1) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen. There are a handful of improvements:* The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p(from 720p). You can noticeably tell that it is crisper.* You will also find out that it is a bit brighter. For us geeks, that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max(when auto brightness is turned on).* Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2. However, it is still not as good as the HTC One's screen. The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels(velvety deep blacks). As a whole however, and because of its Pentile pixel system, it comes just a bit short of the HTC One's Super LCD 3. It is really nitpicking though, so you won't ever regret this.2) This phone flies, almost literally. The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag, and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart's content!3) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note. Too much to describe all the functions, and you can do without it for most functions. But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4) All those software features! Granted, you can do without most of them for day-to-day things, but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use. The are also too many to go through all, I but what I love most is the Smart-Stay, which uses the front camera to monitor that you're looking at the screen and won't dim/turn off, which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages, etc., holding the phone up with one hand, and your other hand is pre-occupied. No more having to shuffle around to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up. This is especially and specifically useful for me when I'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app.5) The sound is noticeably louder as well. It doesn't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One's dual stereo speakers, but by itself it is louder. This is useful when you are in a noisy environment, and having one loud speaker is more useful than having two immersive speakers that are softer and harder to hear. As good as the HTC One sounds, I hate that for most things like music and video, it is so darn soft and frustrating. I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use.6) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it, and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I'm in bed at night. The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME. I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20% will already be gone. And when I charge it, it trickle charges like a turtle! With the Note 3, being able to replace the battery is an added plus, and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly. But even these two advantages cannot compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place.CONS:There are few things you can nitpick, like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy, not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones. With rumors of a new Galaxy line, this may be changed very soon though. Also, the Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. Luckily, being Android means we'll never have to settle. My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look, is Smart Launcher Pro. Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I can't think of much else really to fault this phone, except for the fact that simply for what it is: It's a niche machine that's half tablet/half phone - it will never satisfy you as a tablet replacement(I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range), and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it, and do all the things you need one-handed(I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S). But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is, then there is no better alternative.

This phones standard battery can last me all day typically, which is pretty impressive considering the screen size difference and the specs. The only con about this phone that I planned for was the back cover. It may have the faux leather back, but that does not give very much grip. I purchased a spigen case that has a soft touch back on it and adds nothing to the phone. Rooting this phone was super simple as well, so don't be afraid to try. The rooting method I used also did not wipe any data off the phone. I do recommend that after rooting you go into a terminal emulator and disable knox.

Buy a case for this phone and A TEMPERED GLASS SCREEN PROTECTOR. it you dont know what it is then google it! I dropped it on the face and the screen protector saved me a 200 replacement cost. I have no issues with call quality or trying to hear anybody. The camera is sexy! it charges pretty fast.the negative.Its size isnt for everyone.... im 6ft 3 200 lbs and my hands are pretty big.It feels very light even though thats a good thing. i always had this feeling that i would drop itthe instructional manual that came with the phone is useless.there so many features to this phone and there nice and all but it has a SERIOUS learning curve to it.

Check my video review for review of phone, some apps and GPS capability at the end. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone.  It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 2 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them. Phones don't get obsoleted. The previous gen phones still make phone calls and take great pictures as they did on day 1. Both Galaxy Note 2 and 3 have Micro-SIM. I have played around with a Note 3 and using on a regular basis and it is gorgeous phone in itself. The following paragraph applies to buying unlocked phones..DISPLAY: Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen.Note 3 has 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm (5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in) and weight 168 g (5.93 oz).Note 2 has Dimensions 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4 mm (5.95 x 3.17 x 0.37 in) and Weight: 183 g (6.46 oz).Note that it has become slightly less taller and 15 gm lighter! This is great as weight is a very important factor in handholding and for long uses. Both the phones have excellent S Pen stylus.Note 3 has 1920 x 1080 pixels, 5.7 inches (~386 ppi pixel density).Note 2 is 1280x720 pixels, 5.5 inches (~267 ppi pixel density). Note the superb increase in resolution. This is great as Note 3 has full HD finally. For comparison, Galaxy S4 has 5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display (441 ppi).MEMORY Both Note 3 and Note 2 has Card slot : microSD, up to 64 GB. Internal: 16/32/64 GB storage, Note 3 has 3 GB RAM whereas Note 2 has 2 GB RAM.WLAN: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band, DLNA (Both Note 2 and Note 3)Bluetooth: v4.0 with A2DP, LE, EDR (Both Note 2 and Note 3)NFC: Yes (both Note 2 and 3)USB: microUSB v3.0 (MHL 2), USB Host (Note 3, finally USB 3 on phones!)microUSB v2.0 (MHL), USB Host (Note 2)CAMERA:Note3: 13 MP, 4128 x 3096 pixels,autofocus, LED flash, Video 2160p@30fps, 1080p@60fps (Note 3, Note the substantially improved camera resolution)Note 2: Front: 8 MP, 3264x2448 pixels, video: 1080p@30fps, check quality; Back: 1.9 MPI feel for low light the camera did not perform well and this is an improvement I would like Samsung to make in low light sensors.Chipset:Note 3: Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400 (LTE model)/ Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 (3G model) Note 3 has Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 and if you see they have several technologies for different models.Note 2: Exynos 4412 Quad CPU: Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9 GPU: Mali-400MPSensors: Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometerGPS: with A-GPS support and GLONASSBATTERY: Li-Ion 3100 mAh battery (note 2) 3200 mAh (note 3)SAR (radiation level is often not considered in many reviews and it is an important level of comparison).SAR:Note 3 US Model: 0.55 W/kg (head) 1.49 W/kg (body)Note 3: EU Model: 0.21 W/kg (head)Note 2 US Model: 0.23 W/kg (head) 0.95 W/kg (body)Note that SAR ratings have increased for Note III version.Galaxy Note III is an awesome phone for its use cases. It is a delight for note taking purposes. I have used Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, Galaxy Tab 2/3 and I really love the Galaxy series. I can see the high end smartphones really getting saturated. For users with Note II or S4, I will not recommend upgrading unless you always want the latest and the greatest. You still have a great phone and it is not outdated just because Note III has come out. Your camera takes just great pictures as it did last month. Just like Detroit/Japan rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades. If you have a different phone or a low end phone or you are from that iSomething world, welcome to Galaxy series!Battery life is good.  The video playback was crisp. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs. I am not that annoyed with the Samsungware as I really like S-Health and some other apps. Mainly note taking apps are awesone.  People of course can root and put Cyanogenmod at some point later.I used to put a 64 GB microSDXC card SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging for video/song/ebooks.  I have since upgraded to 128 GB MicroSD and it works great! No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are: AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.Note III infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. Games were very buttery. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Smooth and Stunning display! NFC works awesome. I use a Qi charger with a Qi wireless receiver and they work great as well.Some Extra Accessories:NFC has lot of use cases. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAldiko Premium and Kindle Reading AppsAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoiceTemple Run series of gamesPlenty of WidgetsAPPENDIX: If you are comparing multiple phones, here is the quick highlevel breakdown of top phones as of mid 2014.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone.

If someone is complaining about the camera on this then I would suggest they stick with a real camera and not bash this phone camera.  It is after all a smartphone first and the camera is just an added plus. Features are beyond what I take full advantage of and if I did use them all, it would probably make the experience with this phone that much better. Some people complain about quality of Samsung phones(ie plastic back,  sides etc).  However, I have always put a case on my phones, so this has never been an issue with me. Like some others have stated, there are occasionally some issues with call quality.  I don't know how much of that is the phone versus Sprint's cell service.  I get echos on my calls when I  am near my work area, but not so much near my home. Lastly,  battery life.  This has been the longest lasting battery life on any phone I have owned.

Mine is perfect. I do not have any noises during my phone calls and I have never had anyone complain about any noises from the other end.I really love this phone. In fact, I ordered both this phone and the LG G2 so I could decide which I liked better, first hand. They are both spectacular phones, but I was constantly using the Note 3 because it just offers so many features. I also found the keyboard for texting/typing to be a lot easier and more accurate on the Note 3. The screen is so beautiful, it is just amazing. I also compared the cameras for both the LG G2 and the Note 3. I do not like how long the note 3 takes to process the images, especially because I'm trying to capture my 2 and a half year old, but compared to the LG G2, the camera was much better in the dark with the flash. In fact, in a pitch black room it took a crystal clear image with the flash.I switched from the iPhone 5 and I even tried the 5c, first, which I love Apple products, but just wanted to try something new and different with a bigger screen instead of using a phone and a tablet all of the time. I have not regreted it yet and I've had the phone since the first week of December. I bought the black, although I wanted the white but it was sold out and I didn't want to miss the deal. I figured I'd exchange it for the white when amazon restocked it, but after feeling the rubbery back, I figured I better keep the black because the white has a lot of potential to pick up dye from pockets of jeans, etc. (But, you can find the battery covers for cheap on eBay if you needed to) The back looked ugly when I saw it online, but it feels great and has a great grip and it looks much better in person.The battery is AMAZING. It never dies, and I'm on the phone non stop. When I first got the phone I was trying to kill the battery when it was so low it was red. I had to play a movie, Up in HD to be exact, more than two full times on the brightest screen possible, for the battery to eventually die. I mean, it was ridiculous because I just wanted the battery to die! Lol. And if the battery isn't enough,  you should see the speed at which this phone charges. It is seriously incredible coming from an iphone,  ipad and imac household. Our devices don't charge in half of the time that it takes to get this phone at a full charge.One more thing I will mention for Sprint users: we drove home for Christmas in Decmeber, which we follow 95 all the way from SC to CT. Many times during the trip, I placed the phone in the cubby that my radio screen is in, leaned up on the screen of the radio so my son could see the phone. From there, I streamed multiple Netflix shows for him and HD movies from Vudu, mostly over 4G. It was crystal clear and so fast I was literally amazed. The speaker is not as loud as it could be, but it doesn't bother me.Just remeber, Amazon has a 14 day return policy on your opened device, so you might might as well try it if you are even hesitsting. If you maybe get one that displays the said noises during phone calls, try to even just exchange it to see if you get get a good one. If you get a good one, it's amazing and certainly worth it.Also, and seriously the last thing, if you are a current iphone user: I love the GooglePlay store! I got the movie Up for 8.99, they had each of the three toy story movies on sale for 8.99 (regular 17.99-22.99) and I got the movie Elf FREE in Decmeber AND a free Pearl Jam album album when I was going to download some of their music!! I have spent so much money on iTunes and I have never been offered anything for free, nor have I ever recieve a \"sale\" email notifying me of any amazing Disney movie deals. Just letting anyone know who is worried about switching!", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "A wonderful phone that will last a long time.", "Author": "Lori Helgoe", "ReviewID": "R1YVS1XAQWK6OR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hope to be very thorough with this review and cover many different points that i feel are essential to the everyday use of a phone.Display: This pretty much is the most important part of any phone since it is the thing that you must use to do anything with the phone.  With that being said you will love using this screen.  It is absolutely GORGEOUS.  It is a 5.7 inch display with a full 1920 x 1080 high def resolution that is simply stunning to look at.  The colors are saturated and, due to the fact that it is an AMOLED display the blacks are as black as possible which adds to the color popping that you experience with the display.  The phone can get quite bright and relatively dim screen which helps for power users who like to conserve battery with by turning there phones screen down a tad.  The only negative that stands out in respects to the screen is the fact that if you are in direct sunlight the brightness has to be turned almost all the way up for it to be completely viewable, however, i haven't found this to be anything more than a minor nuisance.Software: Also another part of the phone that you will be looking at all the time is the software that is on the phone.  Out of the box you are greeted with Android 4.3 JellyBean with Samsungs TouchWiz interface on top of Android.  Overall the experience is good.  Everything moves fast and works exactly the way you want it too.  However, there are some times where TouchWiz will make the phone stutter which can get annoying at times.  Bundled with the phone are some Samsung apps that most people will glaze over after checking out.  The one that some may actually use is the WatchOn app.  This app will make your Note 3 your universal TV remote as well as your TV guide.  This is a great way to save space on your coffee table.  I recommend not using a case when using this app because most cases interfere with the IR blaster at the top of the phone that will cause the signal to be undetected. The bundled Google apps are relatively useful especially Google Now which is Google's voice activated search app.  It works wonderfully and is excellent at speech recognition and is a joy to use and see what questions you can ask!Media Consumption: One thing that a lot of people do now a days on there phone is consume media i.e. watch youtube, movies and listen to music.  For the most part the Note 3 does all of these things beautifully.  When it comes to watching any sort of video is a pleasurable experience due to the size and quality of the display.  Its an immersive experience that very few mobile phones offer.  When it comes to the quality of the speakers on the phone, they are more than adequate but if you have a pair of headphones(which you should since the phone comes with a pair!!) you should use those for an even more enjoyable time.  The music app is your standard music app which is good or bad depending on who you are.  You will probably download a separate app for music if you really care about the looks of your apps.S-Pen: One of the things that makes the Note 3 a separate category is the S pen.  It provides a totally unique experience with its own set of apps.  Most of the apps are somewhat gimmicky but some of them are useful.  The action memo feature allows you to take out the s pen and jot down a quick note that you can save and if it is a phone number it will highlight it and you can add it as a contact.  The s note app is where you can take notes with the s pen and after using it in school for a few classes i must say that it works quite well.  You can also use the s pen anywhere you can type and use the handwriting recognition which is scary accurate.  Overall the s pen is something that works very well but you will use it less and less unless there is one feature that you just absolutely love about the s pen.Camera:  The camera on this phone is one, if not the best camera on a phone.  13 megapixels is a great number but, it doesn't always show how good the camera.  In this case the number reflects performance.  You get extremely high quality pictures that will wow everyone you show them too.  Their is a plethora of shooting modes that you can explore and it really is a joy to shoot with.  When it comes to video it is equally as stunning with an added bonus.  The Note 3 can capture full 4K resolution video.  That is 3840 x 2160 pixels.  For those of you that know what that is that should be a huge benefit to having this phone as well as making for a future proof phone.Power: If you have heard anything about this phone you have heard of the raw power this phone possesses.  Its packing a 2.3 Ghz quad-core snapdragon 800 processor with 3 gb of ram and 32 gb of storage.  These are incredible specs that many high end tablets dont even have.  This ensures a future proof phone and a phone that can run anything and everything you throw at it with almost no lag.  You can switch between apps fast and even use multiple apps at once thanks to the help of the ridiculously fast processor this thing totes!Overall: This phone overall is one of the most powerful and all around amazing phones on the market.  The size may turn off some but if you can get use to its size then you will be in the presence of a truly amazing phone.

Touchwiz doesnt slow it down at all due to the most ram in any phone on the market right now at 3GB... 32GB base model for storage space is a nice bonus, but would liked to have a 16GB model for $50 cheaper overall bc you can always add in a microSD card for extra space.The camera is good, but it would really benefit from a more in-depth image stabilization feature as sometimes it takes a few seconds and or tries to get the auto focus just right.Battery life is awesome and the best ive ever had on a smartphone.I like to newly more square style a throwback to the original note and galaxy S2 models.The premium faux leather type backing is so nice you have to feel it to believe it. Adds a little more grip to it as well so its less likely to fall, but if you add a case then you cover all that premium feeling and grip up :(Works with the galaxy gear!USB 3.0 but you can still use your older MHL microUSB adapters, OTG and charge cables as well.Wish samsung would workout the auto brightness to work as good as it did in earlier models, but thats a software issue not the phones fault.My only complaint so far is that the metal looking trim is not very durable, as I already have a little ding in mine.

You cannot transfer native \"phone\" calendar info from a Note 2 to Note 3.

So, if keeping your prior native phone data is important, you'll be out of luck (yes, Samsung released a buggy phone which had no means to receive Note 2 native phone app backups. You'll also loose all your SNote book covers as SNote for the Note 3 is not compatible with the Note 2 (but the raw Note 2 data will sync with Smartswitch to the Note 3... You'll just loose all your formatted covers). Nada on the Note 2 native phone calendar entries.There's no way to get them to the Note 3 unless you manually change all your calendar entries to a Google or Samsung account. Also Google will only Sync a few months worth of Data. Thus, if you were leery of keeping your calendar on Google's or Samsung's \"might be hacked someday\" server, and saved your info to the native galaxy note 2 calendar app instead, you're outta luck getting your calendar info onto the Note 3.

The fantastic battery life. No stalls/crashes.  It does everything it says that it can do (unlike my original Galaxy phone which was an on-going series of disappointments).  So far, the only small disappointments have been:1st: The home page(s) will not display in landscape mode (as will just about every other app I have installed on the phone will).  I understand this just isn't a feature that was built into the system.  Even my old horrible Galaxy I would do that.2nd:  The IR Blaster and the \"WatchON\" App (remote TV control) don't work as well as I had hoped.  The interface is a bit wonky, and trying to set up the various A/V devices you're trying to control is not so easy.  And even when programmed and set-up, trying to control multiple devices is just not easy.  I've all but given up on that feature.

Bought this phone for the S-Pen which sets it a part from pretty much any other phone on the market. I knew I would have to adapt to the drastic increase in size coming from the Galaxy Nexus. Its large but manageable for a guy with large hands. Hadnt used a phone with Touchwiz for quite some time and the improvements are noticeable. So much so that I dont really see the need to run a third party launcher. This coming from someone that was running an AOSP Rom (CM11) on a Nexus device. The lag the Touchwiz was known for causing I have not noticed with this device. I like to think Ive outgrown the gotta have the newest yearly device phase and will be holding onto this phone as long as possible. The specs are fairly future proof and the accessories support for Samsung devices is always top notch. So if you're interested in the S-Pen functionality or a phablet device. It doesnt get any better than Samsungs Note series devices. If you just want a new smartphone the S5 or the HTC One will give you everything you need in a slightly smaller package, minus the S-Pen.Edit: Wanted to add a nod to Amazon. I had an issue when trying to order the phone where there was no option to select my current plan which no longer is directly by Sprint. I could only choose one of the newer unlimited plans. Had a short chat session with Amazon Customer Service Rep. explaining my issue. Said he would have the wireless department send me an email. Before I got the email I tried to place my order again and the option to keep my current plan was now available during checkout.

I had iPhones forever, so I'm really enjoying my first exploration into Android (actually I did own an early Android when it was called Droid (v1.0), and my phone hardware sucked so I sadly went the iPhone route).Hard to focus the review only on the phone & not mention Android.  If you're not a technical user, I think Android might be frustrating for you & Apple might work better -- it's more straightforward  &less; 'tweaky'.  If you have no fear of tech, there's a lot of fun to be had here and the Android OS is far more open.Quick focus on Samsung/AT&T; crapware -- there is *A LOT* of it on this phone, and you can't take most of it off without rooting the phone.  The only positive of all this crapware is that it doesn't really slow the phone down, and you can opt to use other stuff most of the time.  But I was surprised after disabling AT&T; update that it ran anyway, and that Samsung updates my apps (even the disabled ones) in the background a lot also.  I have mixed feelings on the 'magazine' app on the phone -- it's ok, but not very easy to use / configurable / straightforward -- not sure why it's not simple for me to swap it all out?That's right -- to get rid of this stuff, I'd have to root my phone.  Not ready to do that yet.As for the phone itself, my call reception is great, the phone runs apps fast no matter what I install, the backlight is bright, and the camera looks pretty good.  I'm having fun with it, for sure.  A few problems:  I hate the camera app, I don't love the phone interface (but I'm used to it), and the built-in launcher seems unnecessarily limited.  And the actual phone design is not as elegant as an iPhone -- iPhones seem very sexy (almost like fine jewlery) in their design, while the Note 3 seems more practical and far less valuable.  I liked taking the back off the phone and upgrading my SDcard -- but I don't plan to change / swap SDcards or batteries, so I do wish the phone felt a tad more sturdy.  But I have a skintight case on the phone and it makes the phone look cooler, makes it feel sturdier, and covers up the hideous faux-leather back which I think is pretty sad looking (fine for a free phone, but for a $250 phone?  Makes little sense to me.)A final 'quibble' -- the S-Pen is neat, but since it's on the bottom, I use it far less than if it were docked in the top.  Strange, no?  And while it has some neat software around it, I thought iPhone has a lot better graphic / art programs (at least, better than what I've found so far for Android).  My fav iPhone graphics app was Adobe Idea, and it hasn't been made for Android (yet?).", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy note 3", "Author": "Mugs", "ReviewID": "R2TTZNZG44BUW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best phone I ever had, I love it.

The battery lasts me a day, every day, at auto brightness, 3 hours of screen use, texting, games, and sync turned on.  It's the best battery I've seen yet!  The best part of the battery, however, is its fantastic charging time.  Due to the USB 3.0, it charges MUCH faster than 2.0.  So if you're running low and need to go somewhere soon, plugging it in for twenty minutes will get you a couple more hours of use.  That's really the only specific feature worth noting.  Everything else is similarly great.  The camera is sharp and much better at taking flash free pictures in the dark.  Call quality has always been great for me, don't worry about the negative review, I think Sprint patched it by now.  The screen is AMAZING.  Super high resolution, great colors, etc.  The finger hovering feature is great too.  More and more I find myself trying to hover over links in the chrome browser expecting them to tell me something, like hovering a mouse over it.  I hope Google makes use of that with the chrome browser soon.  The phone itself is a technological powerhouse.  Everybody knows about the great quad core processor in it.  It's SUPER fast and playing Modern Combat 4 is never an issue.  It's stable too, apps hardly ever force close.  It can do screen mirroring to a number of Samsung BluRay players, Smart TVs, and the Allshare Cast dongle thing.  Wifi Direct is a cool feature too, it's like blue tooth but faster and longer range.  The most hidden features of this phone are quite unique.  It has an accurate thermometer, hygrometer (humidity sensor), altimeter (altitude), barometer (pressure), magnetic sensor (ie compass), accelerometer, gyroscope, light sensor, proximity sensor, and of course GPS.  It also works as a TRULY universal remote.  Honestly, this thing works with EVERYTHING.  I use it even with a 10 year old motorola AV Receiver.  Sprint FINALLY rolled out 4G in my area last month, about a month after I got this phone.  It's a lot faster than 4G, but their service still isn't the best.  Honestly, I would recommend getting this phone on Verizon for a better experience.  Check service coverage in your area before buying!  Oh yeah, the SPen feature is surprisingly useful is you need it, yet incredibly hidden and non-invasive if you don't.  It's really great for taking notes, jotting down ideas or measurements if you're building something for example, etc.  It's also nice just to have as a more precise thing than a finger.  Purchasing and setting the phone up through amazon was easy enough, just follow the on screen instructions.  You do have to use a computer for one step, but it's easy and I had it working within 15 minutes of opening.  If you're thinking of NOT buying the phone because you're afraid it'll be too big, BUY IT!!!  It'll feel completely normal and comfortable within a few days.  Get the phone, you'll love it.  Oh, and also protect it, I imagine this one will hold its value for quite sometime after you purchase it, so do yourself a favor and get a screen protector and case.  I recommend the SUPERSHIELDZ screen protectors and Otterbox Defender case.  With the defender, just take an exacto-knife and cut out the built in screen protector.  It's worthless.Oh, and if you're considering this or the iPhone, get this and make your friends jealous!", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phantastic Phablet!", "Author": "CaptainKhaotik \"Captain\"", "ReviewID": "RTJC2HLPXLYH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm no stranger to smartphones, so I haven't been overwhelmed by the functionality of this workhorse.

What caught my attention to even look at the phone was the mutiltasking capabilities of the device. Being able to calculate my finances while looking at a bill on the internet is great! The multi-window function also provides a level of extra multitasking funtions that other phones don't offer. For example: I can have two windows open using the multi-window funtion then open up the calculator app in a smaller window if I wanted to add some numbers.Then there is the action memo app which allows for quick notes to be taken without having to download aditional apps from the app store. Other apps that come in handy (that don't seem like you will use them at first) are S Note and Scrapbook. S Note allows you to keep a journal of notes that are more serious then actions memo and Scrapbook allows you to take a screen shot of something on the internet that you want to view later without having to keep that tab open. It will copy the link to the webpage for later viewing.Last but probably the most important is price. I am a Sprint customer and was due for an upgrade on my account. After all of the Sprint discounts, I would've paid $250+ dollars for the Note 3. Buying the phone through Amazon the phone was $199.99, which may not seem like that much of a difference but means a lot when my own carrier was not going to lower the price. When I finally was going to purchase the phone on christmas day, Amazon lowered the price another $20 to $179.99 with free 2 day shipping!If your looking for a phone that you will be satisfied with, this is the phone for you. Yes, I know it's large but after a few days of having the phone, you will barely notice the size.**1/8/2014 UPDATE**Another great thing I forgot to mention about the phone was the great battery life.

I can say without a doubt that it's the best phone I've ever own (for my personal tastes and needs). The only one drawback is Samsung's flavor of Android skin known as TouchWiz. TouchWiz isn't dead awful but it does need some work as it's sometimes laggy, freezes, the launcher crashes on average about 3 to 3 times a week and I've not been able to attach pictures from within any app when I choose the Gallery as my source, I have to use Google+ Photos.

This should help. :)", "Author": "James Carlson", "ReviewID": "RR7PIHH69VARU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "on our family 10-line plan, we have 3 of these phones, 4 LG G2s and 3 basic flip phones.As to the Note 3 with SPRINT:Father in law bought first one from Sprint store for $350+ tax to upgrade his old phone he was credited for/due. When using the phone as issued, he was having EXTENSIVE problems with call quality. Dropped calls, garbley voices, missed words, etc. I remember when considering this device for myself, trying to have conversation with him with my trusty, old LG Optimus S...over 4 minutes of talking with him, I needed to recall him more than 8 times, due to his Note 3 phone's ability to hold a call--repeated drop calls within seconds!!! Although I thought this fan-dangled new Note 3 phone was a worthless hunk of crap at first...I REALLY wanted to like it still, so read dozens and dozens of reviews from all carriers.I live in an area that is currently undergoing a 4G LTE expansion, so figured, in the end that the issue/conflict 'tween Samsung and Sprint was related to this new tech in our area....and ended up taking the plunge on a Note 3 for both my wife and self.IF YOU'RE WANTING TO KNOW THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE, I INCLUDE THE NEXT PARAGRAPH TO LET ANYONE KNOW HOW I GOT MY TWO NOTE 3s FOR LESS THAN $30 EACH (skip it if you don't care)!I REALLY wanted to order ALL my phones thru Amazon for countless reasons, but a glitch with Sprint didn't allow me to do so...the system kept disallowing Amazon from adding any lines of service to my account, although I was cleared/approved by Sprint for 11 lines. *sigh* So, bittersweet...Regretfully, yet thankfully, I went to local BB (The blue store with yellow accents) & bought 'em all there (over 4 horrible return-trip-to-stores, attempts to activate with continued issues with Sprint's system glitch....NOT the fault of BB--they were also fantastic.) each for $220 +tax. [I returned today and had 'em adjust pricing for the crazy-low price Amazon blew these out for @ $125 +tax, each!!! which ended up being $25 each, since I got in on BB's promo and traded in two literally-worthless (6+yr-old) smartphones for each Note 3 to get $100 credit applied during first purchase, lol!]Well, onto the phone's functionality:SAME ISSUES with lack of calling-functionality, out of the box: Crappy phone/voice quality. So I switched the settings from 4G LTE to CDMA and problem solved!!!Since then, we've enjoyed sooooooo many functions, and the display, and adequate phone-call quality without hiccups/issues for about a month now! My wife got white, mine's black and both have their pro/con and we are both completely satisfied and thankful for this phone we feel is by far the best out there currently.The LG G2s are fantastic too, and I can see how someone wanting a bit smaller phone thinking they are ideal, but we like the size of the Note 3 better overall, and it's abilities as a tiny computer/tablet FAR surpass the G2 in our opinion, and would have been worth the $240 extra if stuck with that. CERTAINLY worth $25+tax \"splurge\" over ANY phone I've compared it to, lol!Hope those main 2 tips help anyone in consideration of this phone.  (BB tends to have that promo going a majority of the time, where you can trade any 2 working smartphones toward the purchase of a certain model they carry [during my purchasing time it was the Note 3 one week, the G2 other weeks], totaling $100 off your new phone, and will match prices here too!)Although I saved so much more money in the end with BB, I'm still letdown that Sprint's glitch prohibited me from an Amazon purchase--they certainly earned my business, and EVERY time I've had issue or needed to get help from their wireless dept.......they were HANDS DOWN the best customer service I've dealt with in a long long time.I saw one other reviewer concerned that when trying to activate their phone, they couldn't because they were told by their carrier that the phone was attached to someone else's account. Happened to me in the past too>> simply call Amazon's hotline for wireless support, and they take care of the glitch in minutes while you're on the phone...sometimes when Amazon ships/processes, the ECN/phone #, is left in limbo...they make a quick call and clear it up instantly to allow for your mailed-phone to be activated onto your account.*SMILES*", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone!!!", "Author": "Cinthya0910", "ReviewID": "RAWBC8PM6NEE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a month now and I love it!!

I could just tell when it was putting to MINIMUM brightness. I got it replaced for another Note 3... The replacement had same issue... I called Verizon Wireless and then they revealed to me that this was a feature built into device by the manufacturer.
