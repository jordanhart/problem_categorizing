It's a sleek, sophisticated looking machine!it came with:  flip case w/window, two batteries, headphones (white, ipod-style buds) a/c adapter and usb cord and manual. A screen protector came already applied to the screen.  the specs per the amazon description aren't exactly the same.  Processor mtk6589, os android 4.2.1, back camera is 13mp, front camera 5mp (nice surprise!).  The colors and resolution are gorgeous all around. Gps, tethering, bluetooth (no problems picking up my car's hands free), everything is functioning as it should.  I use t-mobile in the USA, so i'm only getting 2g, but the speed is sufficient for the time being.  Battery time seems to be very good. I don't talk on the phone a lot, but I use lots of apps, video, camera, music, messaging, and even on a heavy day it's still ticking when I plug it in at bedtime.  there is a crowded little space under the hood for your sim card, micro sim card and micro sd card that is a little confusing to manouever, but everything does fit!true, there is no stylus, however, i hardly ever use one and if/when i do, i like to keep it separate from the phone.  i mean, what's worse than losing the stylus and having that 'gaping' hole in the phone where it used to be? :)there seem to be many variations on the n9000 theme floating around at amazon, the most prevalent besides the stylus being the air gesture option, which the newisland does include!  it works very nicely and is a classy feature.the reason i ordered my second clone (my first was a note 2 android by star) was because 512mb ram just does not cut it if you're app-savvy.  the 1gb ram on the newisland n9000 is just right for using all those google-related toys you need for your alerts, maps, etc. and still be able to keep up the speed.  all those important apps that need to install on the internal storage waste precious ram mighty fast, and the workarounds, while functionable, will make your phone a bit quirky and at the very least require multi-reboots when the phone doesn't respond. the extra thirty bucks for the 1gb of ram is well-worth it!the size is almost the same as the samsung note 3, samsung being 5.95\" long while the newisland is 6\" long, so you'll have to find an alternative solution for a form-fitting case.  i personally like sleeves (socks, pouches, whatever they're called), and have been able to find a few interesting ones on amazon, ebay and some original ones on etsy.com!Only negatives are:  1) the usb cord included in my order did not function (when I connect it to phone and a/c adapter the screen jumps around and touch doesn't work), so I contacted amazon and they graciously offered 20% back on the phone price.  More than enough to replace the cord!  Thanks, amazon!  (note:  fulfillment by Amazon is a very wise choice when purchasing any third-party phone!) and, 2) since it's quite a big unit, the angle you use while talking on the phone has to be adjusted and gotten used to.  Sometimes I hit a button on the screen and have cut myself off a call more than once!so if you're looking for a phone you can use anywhere, on your own sim card, and you're sick of being tied to a two-year contract and fees for a locked name-brand phone, you need to get one of these puppies...you won't regret it!", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "Arshdeep D.", "ReviewID": "R3R7NML3SWE3OR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone was everything that I expected and more.

The phone has a awesome screen, great camera (better than the note 3) good processor & fast internet. Wifi & 3G (I was surprised btw when I seen how fast it was). Now the downside is that this phone doesn't comes with a S-Pen, doesn't have air sensors, you can't screenshot at all, soundcard for music is a 6 out of a 10. Also this phone is light very light. My galaxy note 2 weighs more than this & is much better than this phone also. In my opinion this phone is basic compared to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. For example you have the Dodge Charger SRT (Samsung Galaxy Note 3) & The Dodge Charger SE (This phone Newisland N9000). It has the look & the normal basics but not great stuff you get from the galaxy note 3. On AnTuTu Benchmark it had a 13588 score, good rating & ranked #11 on the bar chart behind the Google Nexus 4 & right before the Samsung Galaxy S2.

The speakers are loud, not very quality sounding. It came with jelly bean, but no stylus. It does, however have 2 SIM card slots, micro and regular, but the regular slot is also where you place the sd card. Luckily straight talk sells all 3 versions of sims. Having it fully unlocked, we see able to use the phone as a WiFi hotspot with no problem. This phone also picks up WiFi with no problem.

(Feb. 24)  I like it. Front side pictures/Videos not so great. Even if there's light they come out dark. The home button feels loose/wiggly. Other than that, everything else is ok.  For the price is an awesome phone . I gave it a 4 bc of the front camera.Update** camera setting were changed & pictures are better.  Have not found a case yet. I see a few here on Amazon.  Will look into it. The phone is a little slippery, the back is soft. The battery does drain fast. It will probably need 2-3 charges a day if you're a heavy user. 4*Update 3/6/14Have not found a case that fits. This phone is way bigger than a note3.I've had the phone a while now, I've changed settings to my liking the only thing that sucks is the internet connection. I'm on Tmobile  Unlimited. When I use wifi at home it's fast but when I'm  not...ohmygoodness. It's slow. Takes a while to get to a website & idk if there's anything I can do about that :(  my phone is usually on E or no internet connection... 3*Update 3/8/14I thought about returning, but instead I gave phone to my mom.  She likes the big screen & says she doesn't mind that the internet is slow, that all she wants is to be able to make calls! Who'd a thunk it ? Lol  & my husband kept the other one. He says he doesn't mind the net being slow either. He doesn't get on his phone much & when he does, we are at home using wifi. Great phone for the Price. But it's just not for me! & if you have  Tmobile 77093 Houston Tx. & are a heavy internet user-- You might want to rethink this purchase. Otherwise it's a pretty cool phone & Seller was great & helpful.One of sellers emails:hi.thanks for your time,if you are use AT&T; or net10 then there have two SIM card slot.put it in the other SIM card slot then it work with 3G for sure.it will not work with tmobile 3G and tmobile tower 3G.any questions please feel free to email us.-------3/10/2014*last update! Promise! LolMy mom has simple mobile. I'm not sure why I thought it be diff than tmobile! Same towers! She loved the phone though.  Hated the internet speed . We are paying  for 4G speeds & not worth keeping the phones..So will just return & hopefully have an easy return to seller with no problems. I' paid 394 for both. Price is going down.
