I had the iphone 3 and wanted something different.  I put a 32GB SD card in it and can not wait to load music onto it.  The only thing that is inferior is the camera.  Its only 2 mega pixel.  But its a phone not a camera and the images are decent.  EVERYTHING about this phone is cute!  The icons, the alerts.  I am thinking of buying another one for back-up in case I lose this or break it because I can not live without it!!!!!!!!  I am soooo happy!", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "cute phone but", "Author": "Shell Griggs", "ReviewID": "RYO4VSM73OMEU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not compatible with some apps.

Arrived in nice packaging and shipped on time.Cons: Loads a bit slow, but was expected since this is an older phone.  Very brief start up instructions for phone and not as detailed.  People with no experience with smartphones might have some issues getting used to the phone.Overall, not a bad phone, would order again from seller!", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Product!!!!!", "Author": "DaughterPleaser", "ReviewID": "R13R74FQZ7RXRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my daughters birthday and she loves it.She can take pics,text,email,play games and more .She says if she could turn back time she would  thank the makers of this product.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "careyann", "ReviewID": "RAJ23OPAMAFH9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my 13yr old daughter and she love so much.  she likes all the  apps and the android capability.
