I ordered it, and got discouraged because it said it was going to take a whole month to deliver. It came here in 2 weeks! When I got the phone, I was amazed because this was a huge upgrade from my old phone. There are tons of things you can do, and apps you can get. There's cable TV on this phone! The resolution is great, and the phone is loud when you get calls. Mine came with a case, that has a little trouble staying on but its pretty cool. In other words, if an iPhone is a Ferrari, your getting yourself a nice, BMW :))", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "THIS PHONE IS AWESOME!!! THIS IS A GREAT DEAL", "Author": "Roger Keller", "ReviewID": "R27S5P2A329RO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off i dont know why all the negative feedback for this phone, this phone works just as fast if not faster than most android phones out there! It is superior in speed and i believe it is a quadcore processor, as soon as i recieved this phone i put my tmobile simcard in it, it picked it up right away! i dialed a number and it went right through no problems at all, now the next day i had a popup! that said invalid mmi ussd code, ok so i did some checking online and come to find out that this is pure vulnerability for someone to wipeout your simcard and it is preprogrammed into this phone! wow so is what i did is download ussdfix from google play installed it and followed the directions and it fixed the phone and removed the hack from my phone, now it works perfect no problems at all, i love this phone and is super super fast but lightahead and amazon need to check these phones before they ship them out to remove this vulnerability hack!!!!", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "False Advertisement. Phone is international so its uncompatible with EVERYTHING! I can't download ANY apps and the wifi sucks!", "Author": "tammi", "ReviewID": "R2S6C7CIPN0C2G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First things first, this ad does not say galaxy sIII mini but thats exactly what the sticker on the phones screen read when I opened the almost EXACT box that galaxys come in! So of coursr, I was expecting the same great quality and handy apps that I know the galaxy phones possess and the google app store have. I have 4g service through my provider yet this phone is always stalling, freezing, or just acting up. I called the samsung service center thinking this was a samsung galaxy, and they could help me with these tecnical issues and what not, that is when I was informed that the IMEI number went to some old Nokia flip phone. I kept trying to convince him that this was a galaxy SIII because it said so on my phone. He then asked me where I brought the phone from, and that's how we established that this was an international phone. Upon contacting the seller about these issues, they responded and told me to send them the phone back so they could do some upgrades, but that this was not a galaxy phone; its basically a knock-off! But why would I send my phone that I already paid for back to a company that is obviously doing something wrong, if they have to put incorrect IMEI numbers on the phone. That's like switching a cars VIN number! It took 3 weeks for me to receive this phone, so if I was i send it in for upgrades, it would take at least 8 weeks or more for me to get it back. I don't recommend this company or this phone to anyone! Be careful, they go by several different names!", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "rickey moxey", "ReviewID": "R2RD142661PRF8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this phone is great works fine and my daughter can't put it down.

I wonder whether these people even have a company or whether they are operating a sweat shop out of a basement.

I had to put in a claim with Amazon and wonder whether I will ever even see my money at all.All I can say is that I feel like a complete idiot. I should have read the reviews beforehand instead of being impressed by the good price. The phone was supposed to be for my 9 year old granddaughter, so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it. Well, now she doesn't have a phone and I possibly lost my money.

As for cases, I purchased a nonhard shell S3 mini case for it and just cut the hole for the camera to make it wider! It pretty much does everything the I-phone does if not more. The graphics are amazing! It basically is the S3 only smaller. I was very skeptical about purchasing this but I'm glad I did! Heads up though, the shipping did take about four weeks!

The box includes, phone, flip over case (nice quality), two batteries, standard headphones,screen cover, usb charger with base. the cord to the charger isnt long at all, so you might want to by a longer one, just for convenience. Its a standard android charger, you'll have no issue finding a nice one for a cheap price. the speakers on this phone are AMAZING. very loud and clear. the phone looks exactly like a galaxy s4, most clones have a yellowish tint to the flash located under the camera. however the flash on this phone is clear, giving it a realistic look. im going to go ahead and say, if you are trying to buy a $100.00 phone, this is it! this is coming for someone who has had many phones. from  iphones to windows to androids. this is a real favorite of mine. now i just have to wait and see how long this phone will last.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "surprised  at the quality", "Author": "overdrive", "ReviewID": "R15YKK0WWBRUXG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It took three weeks to get it from Hong Kong.

Unfortunately, it was nothing like a normal phone. when i opened it...it felt like a toy phone, i tried to save some numbers into my contacts it took forever. i tried to text... it took for everrrr to respond and with picture messages it never allowed me to do so. i struggled to exit the screen or whatever i was checking. overall, it's dead slow and i really hated it and badly regret taking the time to shop on line for a phone. on top of that, i paid from own pocket to return it even though i barely used it. it was a matter of one night where i tested it, got so upset, then put back in its box. i already sent it by mail ten days ago and till now i didn't receive my money back. By the way, it's supposed to be my son's reasonable gift and affordable to me....thanks", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Good to buy", "Author": "esam", "ReviewID": "R3IEQZTXTRF6L5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the phone and the box look great,with 2 battries , but all this not work after 26 days of use, Don't Buy it", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't do it, keep your money in your pocket!!!!", "Author": "LEWIS", "ReviewID": "RRU1JFLC39MBK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Terrible is how should start out, regarding this product.

The \"ear piece\" that was provided broke within the first two weeks, literally fell apart. The only way to have a halfway decent conversation was while the phone was on speaker and that got increasing worse to hear or be heard. The screen froze a few times and then it became constant, I was taking the battery out 10+ times a day to restart it. The screen would go a blank white and stay that way until again, I had to take the battery out. Often, while trying to send a text the keyboard would get stuck and not even come up on the screen in it's entirety. Then it began to turn itself off, all day long! The worst part is, I contacted the seller 7 days after the 30 day magic time frame and the seller did not try and resolve the issue AT ALL. The only response I got was basically was oh well it's been more than 30 days... REALLY? What horrible business! To add insult to injury, I filed a claim with Amazon, thinking that they are such an upstanding a reputable site that they would surely help me with this issue and make things right. Well, WRONG! Amazon basically said the same thing, oh well you should have contacted the seller sooner! WOW, all I can say is I will never use Amazon again.
