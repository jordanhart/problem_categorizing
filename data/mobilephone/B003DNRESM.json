First of all I am not in the mood for a smartphones. I have devices to surf in the web, to make presentations, to read documents. Actually I do all these things with my notebook and with my kindle on the go. My objective was to have a nice phone with long battery life that I could send SMS text and play music (mp3 and fm radio). It also have a camera! The design of this phone is great. It is small and good looking. Very satisfied. Motorola did a nice work here.If you want a cellphone this one is great! If you want a smartphone look for something else.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good phone", "Author": "Watch fan", "ReviewID": "R127R4PL8WHJ8C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did not get this phone from Amazon, but from my local phone company.
