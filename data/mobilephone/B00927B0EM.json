{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works", "Author": "Kell", "ReviewID": "R2TKHSJN3LLXQ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I looked at reviews and videos of this phone compared to other phones before I ordered this one. I really loved how the EnV 3 and Octane has the QWERTY keyboard but I wanted an updated look with the touch screen. Phone shipped quick without any issues. The activation of the phone was fine and Verizon did not ask for a data plan. There were two issues I have with the phone: 1.) I ordered this phone as \"new\" but when I started customizing it, there was already another person's ringtones, recent calls, name card and contacts on the phone. I guess that means it was briefly used by another person. I didn't like having to fix that. 2.) I had to calibrate it a few times to get the touch to be accurate. This is not a sensitive touch screen like you would find in an iPhone or an Android, this is simply an LG. It's more like you have to \"press\" the buttons than touch. Even after a few calibrations, it is still not accurate, but it functions.What I love about this phone is that there are four different ways you can text. So, if you're a text savvy person, this is great. You get the t9 on portrait, a QWERTY when you flip the phone, the qwerty keyboard when you open the phone, and on the touch screen there is a \"pen\" selection here you can draw the letters and numbers to text. I would love that feature IF the touch screen was more accurate.Overall, the phone works great and is a good compromise between modern and dinosaur.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Unsatisfied customer!", "Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "RWZD7DSV5MQA0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone worked for less than a week.It was not worth the 75.00 I paid for it.

I have had it for over the 30 day period from purchase, so seller will not exchange, but the phone started not recognizing the touch commands about 2 weeks ago and when I touch to answer a call or to unlock the phone, it doesn't work and I always end up having to call people back.  I have adjusted touch calibration and it doesn't help.  If I touch a 6 I get a 3 or a 9.  It's all messed up and I will now have to buy another phone.

Why the worst I\u2019ve owned? The battery doesn\u2019t stay charged. I bought new batteries twice and they weren\u2019t any better after several weeks of use. I\u2019ve read these 11000\u2019s eat batteries but I wish I\u2019d known that before I bought mine. I used to keep it plugged into a USB most of the time just to be able to have cell use when I was away from a USB a couple hours.Now the mini plug on the phone is failing. I suppose because I have had to use it so often and now it\u2019s prematurely failed.I highly suggest staying away from this 11000.
