It is excellent and user friendly with Windows Phone 7.5 . It will probably suppourt windows Phone 8 if it becomes Available to update for current Windows mobiles since it is the latest generation of Windows Phones.Though it has a small bug of frreze up the improved firmware is now available and has no problem since I updated it with new firmware.Pros:1. Better pixel density than focus.2. Faster 1.4 Ghz processor.3. Is capable of 4G.5. Is latest generation of Windows phone.6. Front facing camera for skype or video chat or video call7. Excellent 5 MP camera.Cons:1. Sometimes freeze up.(though updating firmware solves it muchly) but not completely.2. Smaller screen than samsung focus(3.7 vs 4 inches)So This is an excellent phone for the price.Just go for it. For its specs the phone should be sold for a price range of $250+.Update :12 August 2012After using phone for like 4 months I have following things to say:1. I havent faced a single phone freeze after the recent tango update(there is way to trick phone to update even though AT&T; doesnt push it)2. The app center is growing rapidly(In last few months as I myself have seen). There are a lots of apps tailored for your need.3. Games works great on this device no freezing and lagging.4. Some people haave said that they got a locked phone .I too got a locked phone but THIS PHONE WILL BE UNLOCKED BY AT&T; FOR FREE.Just call them and ask for an unlock code. They will give it right away to you no need to goto third party unlocker.5.

I picked up the Samsung Omnia W (the international equiv. of Focus Flash), which is the newer model that replaces the original Omnia 7, and found it simple to use since day 1.  Skype is now fully integrated making it complete.  Here are the details tech summary:Key features:  Super AMOLED Technology, WVGA (800 x 480) Internal Display Resolution  3.7\" Internal Display Size  16 Million Internal Colour Depth  Gorilla Glass  Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support  Dual-band 3G with HSDPA 14.4 Mbps and HSUPA 5.76Mbps  Windows Phone 7.5 Mango  1.4GHzQualcomm MSM8255 Snapdragon CPU, Adreno 205 GPU, 512MB of RAM  5 megapixel autofocus camera with LED flash (FRONT Facing & BACK Facing!)  720p video recording @30fps  8GB of built-in storage  Standard 3.5mm audio jack  Standard microUSB port (charging, hooking up to PC via Zune)  Wi-Fi b/g/n  Stereo Bluetooth 2.1  Mobile Office document viewer/editor  Social network integration (Facebook/Google/Hotmail etc) and cloud services  Built-in GPS receiver, A-GPS  Stereo FM Radio with RDS  115.97 x 58.8 x 10.9mm Physical Dimension  115.3g WeightAnother good thing compared to the iPhone is the integrated Internet Explorer for web browsing.It has ability to open up to six tabs at a time, and the performance is top notch - the browser relies on hardware graphics acceleration to provide smoother graphics (and video) and animation and uses the latest (and fastest) JavaScript engine too.  This is where the fast processor (1.4ghz Snapdragon CPU) really shines, and you can tell the difference compared to the 1st generation of Omnia 7 (which has slower CPU, but slightly bigger screen), released in early 2011.Overall this phone is speedy, extremely lightweight and portable (iPhone feels much heavier compared to this).  I really feel this is the Smartphone for all-ages, and enjoy the simplicity and speed while meeting my daily needs (Skype, Evernote, flawless Outlook Exchange & Gmail integration, nice Zune player, and HD camera).  Most importantly this is also UNLOCKED so I can just pop in a SIM when I travel (it uses the normal sized SIM, not micro-SIM).Good phone.

I had a smart phone, but it was when the first kinds of touch screen smart phones were coming out and it was straight garbage.  This phone is dynamite.  You know, if you aren't looking to get all the bells and whistles then this is a great phone.  The Windows Platform is not as bad as advertised.  I really enjoy the platform actually.  It is easy to use, and simple to learn.  The phone is lightning quick.  My biggest pet peeve though is there is no functional d-pad on the QWERTY touch screen pad.  It does get annoying some, but overall, it really is a minor issue.  I think the phone is great and I wouldn't trade it out.  I enjoy the heck out of it.

I love my Iphone 5.  I am also a tech geek who likes to try out other things, frequently.  I was wanting to learn more about Windows Phone but didn't want to switch my phone with AT&T; as it is expensive to do.  So my wife had surprised me and bought this unlocked phone for me for a birthday present.  It is simply put a very nice phone.  Windows Phone software 7.5 is good, not great, but good.  The phone itself is really nice.  Good battery life and a battery that you can swap by removing the back cover.  This feature alone would give it 5 starts.  I don't like the sealed up battery on new phones, don't like the fact you have to return to a service center for a battery replacement.  Also if so inclined you could buy a spare battery and have it charged up and put it in your pocket then change it while you are out, if your battery runs low.  The battery life on this is pretty good.  The only complaint I have about this phone is the fonts are small and most are unchangeable.  When typing a text message, you cannot increase the font of the menu items (like send, attach, etc) and have to rely on the pictures.The phone has a beautiful screen and a great feel in your hand - feels solid and not cheesy.Well worth it for the money.

Rhodes", "ReviewID": "R3QS9AXO4WKOIB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update, 11 December 2012:  The battery in this phone rocks!  I had to make an important call while out, and saw as I placed the call the message that the phone's battery was \"critically low.\"  I prayed that it would not cut out during the call, which took several minutes as the service representative I was talking to had to look things up and at one point had to have a conversation with his supervisor.  The battery apparently has a good reserve when it gives the \"critically low\" message, and stayed strong throughout the conversation.  The battery on my old stupid phone would have cut out early in the call.  This one gave me the reserve I needed, and I'm totally sold on that!I ordered this unlocked.  Was convinced it wasn't, and was madder than a wet hen, until I figured out I had the SIM in backwards.  AT&T; was very helpful in getting me started on using the phone, as I am totally dumb about smart phones.I have had a \"stupid phone\" for years, and have to say I really prefer 'em stupid.  But in this day and age, I have no choice (a condition that I do not like), so now I have a smart phone.This model is smaller than it seemed in the product description, and smaller than the loaner HTC I had from my older daughter (who is as smart and savvy about smart phones as I am stupid about them!).  Small as it is, it has a powerful vibrate, and since I will be carrying it in my bag instead of on my person, I appreciate that for the times I am in class or in a library or archive.  I have a nice holster for it to protect it in my bag from car and house keys and other dangerous objects.  And despite being smaller than I thought it would be, it fits in the hand very nicely, and I have rather large hands for a small woman (I stand 5'4\" and my hands are the same size as my 5'9\" tall husband's!)The black-on-black of the controls, and the tiny print on some things (like the model numbers and all inside on the back of the instrument) give me heartburn, as print gets smaller as we get older, and I'm 65.  I have to carry a magnifier with me to read all the instructions, at times!  And the tiny keyboard and my fat fingers have issues, too!  So that's a bit of a pain, but that's true across all brands of phones, not a problem with this one alone.  The controls along each side are difficult to see with them being black-on-black.  I suppose someone will say that I will get used to operating them by feel alone, but in order to get to that point, I have to be able to find them first!The sound seems to be good so far.  The screen is very readable, when I get around the lilliputian type font.  Colors are sharp.  On-screen controls respond well.As far as I can be happy with a smart phone, I'm pleased with this one.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent but with some sound glitches", "Author": "Luis", "ReviewID": "R1VXPBSM0B6HD1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently sold my samsung focus and bought this one. At first I didn't quite enjoyed the smaller screen size but after a couple of days I realized that is the right size for me. Goes well in the pocket and its ease to have in the hand.The 1.4 Ghz processor is well noted in games like PES 2012 or even when seeing my XBL avatar on the game hub.Front facing camera goes well with skype or tango.I'm really hoping that this device will get apollo in a few months.Now the not so excellent part. The speaker is a little lower than the original focus, and sometimes the sounds are missing, like when locking the cell phone, or the first key stroke on a sms.

You can have more than one Exchange server account, multiple POP / IMAP accounts no problem. My old phone (Nokai e63) didn't support multiple exchange server accounts so this was a major item for me.2) Multi-calendar support! If you setup multiple accounts (Exchange, Hotmail, Google) the phone will sync your various calenders and color code each calender's items as they show up on the phone's calender. (VERY useful for me)3) Wifi works every time4) Market place - Not as many apps as Android or iPhone, but certainly a good selection nevertheless.5) Skype!6) Dual cameras, useful for item 5 above, although the cam doesn't come on automatically, you have to enable it every time.Things it doesn't do well -1) NO VPN support! Hopefully to be there in a future update :-(2) Custom ring tones - Really frustrating, you have to limit your ring tones to 40sec, the file has to be less than 1MB AND you must specify 'ringtone' as the genre for it to work. A little too much effort...3) Custom alert tones - Non-existent. You can't set a custom mp3 / wma file as your text alert or alarm tone. *rage*4) Can't copy items between calenders. *sigh*5) Switching between Wifi and Cellular data sometimes doesn't happen, you end up having to power cycle to re-connect to the cellular net after you turn off the wifiEnd Result -Perfect phone if you need to manage multiple email accounts and calenders, really fast and responsive and generally a joy to use.

Just a follow up, if you look at the pictures with the product that is what you should be getting. That is a US version phone, international version does not have a USB cable to connect to computer and charger, only a charger, there are tremendous differences between these two versions, do not let anyone tell you otherwise.

None of them can guarantee that you will receive actual Focus Flash. Until Amazon makes these sellers comply with an accurate product detail and it matches what it states in the item description I highly recommend you do not purchase if inside of the US, you will more than likely not receive a Focus Flash but rather its international version called Omnia W.

It is almost impossible to find a place to hold it along its edges without changing the ringer setting. Sneeze and it opens Bing, which I'm certain gave the Microsoft team a big chuckle and maybe even a bonus (all those unwanted hits are recorded by Bing, so it seems a real competitor to Google).Making a phone call (it IS a phone, right?) requires a three-stage process just to get to the dialing touch pad.If you want to return a call from someone in your address book, you see their name on your \"history\" page AND the number they called from. But when you press the screen to get to their name, you get their full listing, and you have to then choose which number to call, and then press the screen to have the phone dial that number. The Address Book is strictly alphabetical: to get to Ms. W you can scroll in only one direction, starting down from A.Speaking of alphabetical: the list of programs starts with Alarms and ends with Settings. You're forced to scroll down, past programs you may never use (what is \"Now\"?) to get to Settings, which you may often use to change ringtones, etc.It does have a sensitive gyroscope. Move a little bit and the images on the screen do a 90-degree turn. Try to move them back? Not so easy.And last but not least: if you need to download an update from Microsoft (which takes close to forever), you can't simply connect. The download comes through Microsoft's Zune. What? You're not a Zune \"member\" or customer? You have to sign up!

The colors are very vivid and everything appears very clearly on it from videos to text. The build quality is very good and although the body is made of a plastic material it feels very sturdy. It is not as 'bulky' or as heavy as the other focus, and it fits very nicely in the hand.The phone is quite fast and seems to run all of the apps currently installed smoothly and without issue. The camera is also pretty good, though not as good as the aforementioned model of the Focus. Internet connectivity on wifi and through data plan is fast enough for her purposes. Battery life is also not too bad and is able to last the whole day, 7 am - 5 pm, with wifi and data internet connectivity turned off.The only issue she is having is with some of the limits it has. For example; there arent as many apps in the app store, and a vast majority of them look weird or are not as optimized or refined as those for other Mobile O.S's.

The Focus Flash phone is truly unlocked despite what some of the other reviewers stated.  I believe the problem those reviewers are having is enabling it adequately to access the internet using another service.  I had problems accessing the internet as well initially.  It took me a couple of days (and no help from Straight Talk, Samsung and AT&T; and a little help (tiny) from this phone's seller) before I figured out how to enter the Straight Talk APN settings onto the Flash properly so that I could access the internet.  The Focus Flash has APN entries for user name and password which threw me off for awhile.  Also the proxy URL entry on the Focus Flash needed the IP address entry provided by Straight Talk and did not use the web address entry provided by Straight Talk.  One leaves the password entry blank on the Focus Flash which is counter intuitive.  Once I sorted this all out, I was able to access the internet just fine on the Focus Flash.  The first thing I noticed is that Windows phones have very few of the Android apps or any good apps for that matter.  I do think the Windows UI is nice but the lack of good apps is frustrating.  This phone has a smallish screen especially in comparison to the Note 2.  This is an adequate backup phone if one has the need for one which I do since I am using T-Mobile on my Note 2 for it's unlimited data.  Straight Talk (using the ATT sim card) has superior coverage in the hinterlands which I drive through daily; it is unfortunate that the Straight Talk fine print in their terms of use say it is forbidden to use their unlimited internet service to stream videos or use any other program that uses too much data.  It is my understanding that Simple Mobile controls data usage less explicitly per there terms of service but they do cut you off after about 2G per month.  It seems like the only unlimited data is T-Mobile hence my need for a second phone with Straight Talk's ATT sim card service since I drive through the country frequently to get to work and other places that I frequent.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "how to unlock", "Author": "me", "ReviewID": "R1LKQ4GPX1WV92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this phone but apparently it still needs the unlock code. please help me thanks. my phone line is simple mobile and they asked me to call the person i got the phone from.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, nice battery and a great display (actually the best for the price)", "Author": "Jayakumar R.

But the title was deceptive. The phone came unlocked and I bought to for my Straighttalk plan.  The At&T; sim card (normal sized) fit easily and I was up and ready to go in a few minutes and I have a 4G connection on this.  The phone is very slim, feels nice in your hand but is a bit slippery (hence the loss of one star). I suggest buying a case for the phone.  Otherwise everything was better than I expected.  The AMOLED display (similar to the retina display) is just bloody awesome.  I believe the phone has a 1.4 Ghz processor and the videos and games play real smooth.  The phone does not heat up much either.  Windows 7.5 Mango which is preinstalled has great apps on the web and is very easy and intuitive to navigate.  I am waiting for the 7.8 update that samsung has promised to release for this model.  The touch screen is really sensitive to touch and your navigation between panes is very easy too.  I just love this phone.  Have not regretted it.  Suggest getting a windows live account to use the Skydrive that automatically updates your files.  The most important feature is the preinstalled version of microsoft office and the availability of office 360 on it and your files sync automatically between your PC and your phone through skydrive (how cool is that).  Just great.  Also, you can connect to XBOX live online and play games. All this for a fraction of the cost of an iphone is just awesome.  The phone has two cameras front facing (for skype) and rear facing.  The pictures are pretty good and there is a software to auto-fix your pics if you want to.  Overall I am really impressed with the phone.  Though there was something strange about the battery.  It used to last for less than a day when I bought the phone. But once it got completely discharged and after recharging it, it now lasts for over 1.5 days on a single charge with normal browsing and a couple of calls a day.

It's fast and runs smoothly. When I got the phone it was locked to AT&T;, but all you have to do is call their customer service line and they will give you code to unlock it. Took me a while to figure out the phone because it is my first windows phone but I think I'm getting the hang of it. I did have one other issue and that was I could not receive or send picture messaging. However once I found the right site the fix was very easy.This is how you fix it if you're having that problem. Keep in mind you will have to update your  market place first (Or at least I did.) To get the \"Samsung Zone\" to appear. And please read the note at the bottom before thinking that it's not working once you get to the MMSC field.Go to the Marketplace, tap \u201cSamsung Zone\u201d, and download \u201cWireless Manager\u201dOnce that\u2019s installed, open the Wireless Manager appGo to the \u201capn\u201d screen, and tap \u201cedit apn\u201dPush the \u201c+\u201d button at the bottomFill out the data as follows: (any fields that I didn\u2019t mention should be left at the defaults)APN Name: MMSProfile Category: MMSMMSC:[...] (Replace underscores with Periods, no space after http) *See Note*APN:wap.voicestream.comAuth type: noneProxy address:216.155.165.50Proxy port:8080Click the checkmark button on the toolbar*Note: When prompted that you cannot add any more characters in this field, simply add the next character, and each time you are prompted with the message, hit ok. But notice your character was still put in. You should be able to fit the entire thing now, but only one at a time.Credit to: xs2k (wpcentral)If you have any other questions about the phone just shoot a message in the review and I'll try my best to answer them but so far I'd say go ahead and get the phone, I'm not regretting it at all. And just for all you skeptics out there I'm not paid to talk about this phone. I have t-mobile and my LG mytouch was a piece of crap and wouldn't recommend that phone to anyone.

Let me tell you:- The only way you can load something in your phone is thru a kid-like interfase named Zune, which is good only for songs and stuff like that.- You cannot load external content, just thru Zune or from windows approved marketplace. NOTHING ELSE.- you cannot comunicate between your phone and PC unless you download Microsoft special environment.- your phone will be always invisible for File Manager, Windows Explorer or any other tool. No way to move files manually.- you only can access files thru Zune or having an account with hotmail AND windowsphone. When hotmail is down, your smartphone is no so smart. better be prepared to pay for a wideband connection.- you cannot use any other browser than IE. Not Opera, not Chrome, not Firefox, nothing.- adobe reader is allowed, but I never could download heavy files, and then just thru microsoft's own storage in the cloud. I could not use flash or any other tool like that.In the end, I do not blame MS but myself, I did not do the necessary market research and wasted my money into a locked-in operating system, so I only can look with envy when my pals play with their Android, Iphone and even Nokia devices.My only little, tiny revenge to date has been giving my wife a Samsung Ace for christmas.And please remember this phone HAS NO MICRO SD SLOT, all the 8GB memory is internal (just 6,5GB is free for you to use it), so you cannot access it without MS tools)", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelente e increible", "Author": "Yhanny P", "ReviewID": "R364DIQUII9KSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "El telefono en efecto est\u00e1 desbloqueado, el sistema operativo es impresionante, corre bien, sofisticado y sencillo a la vez, excelente para quienes usan las redes sociales y gustan mantenerse actualizados en las noticias y acontecimientos y con sus contactos.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good Phone, But . . . . . .", "Author": "AquanettaJones", "ReviewID": "R228E605GTUBCU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": ". . .
