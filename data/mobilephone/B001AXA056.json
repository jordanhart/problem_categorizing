Lack of clarity of the product itself due to misliding information: on the amazon page it was presented as iPhone 3GS and in reality it was iPhone 3G.2. During initialization the latest release of telephone software from I tunes blocked the phone as not \"apple official unlocked iPhone\".3. As I bring my iPhone to Italy, and return the phone by courrier was diffult I brought the phone for unlocking again to a specialized operator. During the unlocking operation from the serail number it appeared that the iphone was not new but already retured back from the market.4. After one month of work the screen stopped to work and now it remains dark.5. I pull back my old phone in operations", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone was not unlocked", "Author": "t", "ReviewID": "R2348CIMR5M3B4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When we ordered this phone, it was for my daughter who was moving overseas, we needed one that was unlocked as it is easier and cheaper to use the overseas phone service.

Well, let's just say I learned my lesson and I've came to the conclusion that I'd rather have a good ole' Samsung.  The phone was NOT unlocked when I got it, I had to pay to have a guy at an authorized dealer unlock it for me.  When he unlocked the phone my contacts and my photos disappeared.  He really unlocked it_@ this point I had to start from scratch as if the phone was brand new.  After speaking with 2 people at TMobile about operating iTunes, I went to download my apps (some of which I pay monthly for) I was informed that my iPhone 3 was not compatible.  So at this point, I've put out more money than I anticipated, including the apps that I pay monthly for, and I can't do anything but talk and text.  Even picture messaging takes forever and I have to ask for a wifi password everything I go.  This was devastating because I really didn't want to request a refund simply because the seller was nice.  I advise anyone who's planning to purchase an iPhone 3, DON'T.  Just take a step up and spend a little more to get a newer model to prevent yourself from going through what I'm going through.  Everything was good when I purchased the phone, I even received the phone in a timely mannerut as soon as I placed my SIM into the device, it was downhill from there.
