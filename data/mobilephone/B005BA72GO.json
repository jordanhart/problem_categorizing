{"Reviews": [{"Title": "International Warranty Beware!", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R25LW0G3ZH7YLT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased a different phone from Amazon.com (not through, but from!) less than 1 year ago with an \"International Warranty.\"  LG USA claims this warranty is worthless.  Further, because phone is not LG USA phone, they claim to be unable to even repair it, even outside of warranty.  They said \"maybe\" their parent company could do something and referred me to contact LG '', Seoul, Korea, but said they don't know how to even contact them.  Really?!?  They provided me with no contact information.  Unless your Korean language ability is better than mine, you might have trouble even getting a reply.  And unless Amazon is selling the exact same phone and has more in stock (?), they apparently cannot repair or replace the phone.  So, unless somebody out there knows something I don't about this, DO NOT COUNT on a warranty against manufacturer defects.  My phone apparently was a Canadian phone, but perhaps because it wasn't purchased from \"Amazon.ca\", but Amazon.com, LG Canada refuses to honor any \"International warranty.\"  It seems that an International warranty means internationally, there is NO warranty!

Something else.", "Author": "Kean", "ReviewID": "RB7CSDY8BSAN1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I originally posted this review on eBay, but I had some revisions to make and thought it'd probably reach more people here.There's really no need to waste space talking about the specs of this phone, as you can find all of that elsewhere, but I will mention them in passing.The screen is bright, and despite being 800x480, you get a very clear picture for a budget smartphone.Multitasking is not all they make it out to be on this phone. I need to shut down applications constantly, otherwise my phone begins to lag simply switching between pages on the home screen.I've had to shut down my phone due to freezing multiple times, and though I'm not sure if I should blame it on AT&T; or the phone, on occasion the Thrill will completely shut itself off of any kind of connection (3G/4G/Edge and even wireless, which makes me lean towards the phone being at fault).Don't buy this phone for the 3D, it's cool as a party trick, but the most use you'll likely get out of that aspect is the week succeeding your purchase of the phone. I've had mine for nearly eight months and actually took the time to reroute the 3D menu button as a camera button. I haven't used the 3D itself in a few months.The battery will last maybe 1/2-3/4 of a day with moderate to heavy usage. I downloaded JuiceDefender, which improved the battery life exponentially (now it lasts all day, and a little into the next if I need it).LG's UI isn't the greatest. There are a lot of tiny bugs that become annoying if they happen too often (if someone texts you within a second or so of you receiving or making a phone call, it drops the call, the fact that it takes half of it's pages out of Apple's book, and the other half out of Samsung's (which in turn had already taken it out of Apple's), stuff like that). One of my gripes is with their messaging app, it may just be me, but I like to know when I sent a message. Granted, it shows \"Jan 7\", but I prefer to see the time it sent, which it does not show. It does, of course, come with bloatware, but not as much as can be seen on other phones (not to say that there is very little, I'd just say their is a normal amount).The worst issue I have with this phone is the lock screen. I generally like to password protect my phone, but doing so with this particular phone brings up an emergency call icon on the lock screen. If I receive a text message, making my screen come on, and I then jostle my leg a little bit it will, almost without fail, call 911. Granted, sometimes it'll just punch in a bunch of random numbers on the keypad, it still makes the call much more often and much more easily than is acceptable.The camera takes (for me) eight or so seconds on average to load up, so I don't even bother reaching for my phone when I see something I want to record, I just try to commit it to memory. If you do have the time to take a picture or a video though, the quality is pretty good for a five-megapixel camera (and for those of you that are wondering, if you are not in 3D mode for picture taking, it uses the top camera).All in all, it's not a bad device, and it's not spectacular. Even for the price, which has gone down, it can't really be described as a poor choice, but their were many minor things that could have been done to make this a significantly better phone. Think of it this way, rather than find a phone that looks good on paper, but is, like this, a budget phone, drop the extra $100-$150 on a phone that works better, and will be updated, because odds are you won't upgrade again until your contract is up. LG is working on newer and better devices, and owners of this device will be and have been left waiting for quite some time for the ICS update, although rumor has it that that will be released in the third quarter of this year.Although I may be contradicting other reviews, and being maybe a little to nitpicky for somewhat of a budget phone, I hope this review helped, and I promise you that anything that is not obviously an opinion of mine (such as the UI) is based on the actual phone. When I wrote this review, I turned on the camera several times to get an accurate grasp of the amount of time it took to load.Update to my original review; I upgraded to Gingerbread. This upgrade was, in my opinion, a break even for the phone. Everything runs slightly smoother now, the UI has been cleaned up a little, but I believe that it has also imbued my phone with a small element of magic. How else do you explain me listening to Continuum, in correct album order, and the music player switching to dubstep IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SONG.

Why does this phone not have a charge indicator light?BEFORE YOU BUY, consider, picking up this phone at Costco for $30 w/$FREE accessory kit (too tight case, fine car charger, & ok screen protector)(Sign up for a new Costco membership to save more!)!I bought this phone for the 3D. This is the 2nd 3D phone available in the USA (Sprint HTC EVO 3D was 1st). LG's Thrill 4G does beautiful 3D photos and video and you can even output 3D via HDMI! I think the Thrill 4G phone w/3D is better OVERALL than the EVO 3D, even though the EVO 3D has a few better features. Note, Thrill 4G only displays 3D in horizontal view (EVO 3D can display 3D images in vertical and horizontal views), but this may just be a limit of the camera software and 3rd-party software may fix that (Common Google! And update YouTube to make finding 3D videos easier!).See a 3D glasses-free phone in person to appreciate the depth 3D creates! I love 3D photos, watch 3D movies, record 3D video, and play 3D games (I played 3D games on my 1986 SEGA Master System!). I'd love 3D interfaces and/or apps with 3D layered menus 3D zoom effects to manage items on small displays better. You could tilt your phone to \"look around\" 3D objects! Every phone should have 3D since 3D phones usually have a button to quickly toggle 3D on or off, because 3D is not for everyone, but it is for me!Recommended hardware upgrade for the future would be 3 camera lenses on the back of 3D phones to take 3D photos and video in ALL horizontal or vertical views!I also recommend the Case-Mate LG Optimus 3D Pop!

J. Allison", "ReviewID": "R2MP3HEFTP9FBG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the LG THRILL 3D P920 two months ago. I feel it was a pain to get because it seemed no one really stocked it. It finally arrived and I turned it on. Very nice look and feel to it. It's a sexy phone for it's size. I get a lot of compliments on how it \"looks\". The 3D is really mind blowing. It's really fascinating to see pics come out of the screen like that. That's about where it ends.The battery life is poor to say the least. Maybe 18 hours if you are using it \"normally\" like a phone call here and there, a pic or two, an email check once. But if your web surfing and listening to music and making calls alot, THIS IS NOT THE SMART PHONE FOR YOU! Your looking at 4-6 hours at best wen using it constantly.I'm new to ANDROID. So I did all the fancy schmancy \"rooting\" and so on. The phone will go through \"fits\" where it just turns on and off at random for a few hours then just stops? WTH? The screen can be \"catchy\" where sometimes it becomes unresponsive and I have to restart.The proccessor is slow to say the least.It has HORRIBLE, I mean HORRIBLE reception. It won't function in my office and we have a cell tower close. Most everyone in my office has no issues with thier phones, except me haha. The WiFi reception is also terrible. When everyone is boogying on hotspots I'm the guy moving my phone around the air looking like I'm trying to signal space aliens or something.The stuff that really matters, this phone is just sub-par at. Reception, battery life and general usability. I won't be going with another Android based phone either, but android vs IOS is just an opinion. IOS is better for me.But trust me on the 3D capability, WAY COOL!", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone, not amazing", "Author": "Tygus", "ReviewID": "R2B50HT02PRU7A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not as fast as I thought, battery duration is very bad.Perhaps flashing a different rom can solve both issues.3D is very good.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "A un-upgradable piece of crap", "Author": "John Savu \"johny\"", "ReviewID": "R25J35NU68O065", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is big, small battery, the 3d is only a gimmick and the software upgrade to even an old version (gingerbread) is nowhere to be found.
