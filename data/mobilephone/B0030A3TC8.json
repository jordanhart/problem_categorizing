{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice solid smartphone", "Author": "Samurai", "ReviewID": "R1ODUE1GX79G1D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Blackberry is my favorite. It feels very solid especially compared to all the newer models; they feel very \"plasticky\". The color white is an attention catcher. I am always asked what king of phone is that. The operating system is really fast and is very smart. I like the center ball. It makes life easy. I highly recommend this phone but make sure you get it with the Blackberry leather case. My phone screen automatically turns off when I slide it in the case; that makes the phone last 3 days before I have to charge.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Feedback", "Author": "Ivanna Perez", "ReviewID": "R330AUQB4IJ2PY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hi!I bought 2 BB 9000 and i have no major complaints, except non-original Blackberry batteries. One of them threw and error (523) a few hours after, but it turn back to normal after a few minutes. The other one has a small bump in a corner, but nothing too important. I once bought 2 BB from Ebay and was scammed by the seller, the cellphones were reported stolen! so i lost my money. Because of that experience, i was a little apprehensive about buying again on-line.So far nothing has happened with my purchase, so i recommend this product.Thank You!Ivanna P\u00e9rez", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "xpanther", "ReviewID": "R2TWQSLORD7GXG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Item as described.
