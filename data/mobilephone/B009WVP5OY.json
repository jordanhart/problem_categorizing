I have been able to d/l any app I wish to from the playstore.  added a 32 gig sdhc card and have a veritable amount of storage.  call quality is superb and sms ad mms messaging work flawlessly.  had a problem with the proximity sensor, but calibrating the als sensor cured that.  loaded a movie,  \"Flight\" and windows eight recognized it without hiccups.  playback was flawless with just the preloaded player.  a little big, but the elocity wallet faux leather case fit comfortably with the included hard back case.  as some have said the battery cover is a little flimsy,  but comes off fairly easy with a little care.  would I recommend this to a friend.....absolutely.  will update after a few months of using it ,  but so far it's an eye opener wherever I go....fast and bright and clear and movies play in hd....a little problem with hulu plus, will have to play with that.  very nice phone .....", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ok....", "Author": "Jennifer Simon", "ReviewID": "R3KJ5OU1PWR6Z4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone was great except you can't find a case to fit it and the first time I dropped it, the glass cracked in multiple places.  My husband's did the same thing so in a little over a month, both of our phones were ruined.  The design is flawed and the glass sits higher than the phone so even the slightest bump causes it to crack.  It was cheaper to buy new phones than repair these so we went with the Google Nexus 4 which we can buy bumper cases for.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent phone for the price", "Author": "Brian Crowley", "ReviewID": "R2EFGBRB791PDF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(Reviewed after owning this phone for several months) I found this to be a very good phone for the price. The dual SIM feature allowed me a seamless transition from AT&T; to an HVO riding on the AT&T; network. I have enjoyed using the new features of the 4.1 OS, and the camera quality is very good for a cell phone. No, it's no 15-MP camera, and the optics are no comparison even for my 8 MP Nikon, but for quick snapshots or video clips, it works quite well. The battery life is moderate - I find I need to recharge every day, sometimes even during the afternoon if I've been doing too much with the screen on. The size is very comfortable, and the included folding cover is very nice. As I keep my phone in my pocket, I have begun to get a little bit of a seam/crack across the hinge, but as it has held up for a few months already, and promises to hold up for a couple years, I don't have any real complaints. I definitely recommend this phone to others.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mother's Answer", "Author": "Tamara Johnson", "ReviewID": "RHK6FXRH7XZ5S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is beautiful and handles as well as compatible brand names.

So far the phone seems great. It looks really nice, especially considering how cheap it was. I was nervous to buy an off-brand phone but it looks like it'll work great.Pros - Big screen, great graphics. Easy to use too, I've never had an android phone but I was able to use it straight out of the box. Wifi works great. Phone doesn't feel cheap, I would never guess it was so inexpensive.Cons - the \"home\" button seems to be slightly unresponsive, I have to press it twice once in a while to make it work. However, everything else works great.So far I'm impressed! We haven't gotten the talk/text working yet (Straight Talk is being dumb about using our old GSM Sim card, but it's nothing to do with the actual phone). Over all, great quality for the price. A good alternative to buying and expensive phone or getting into a long contract. I actually have an iPhone, and I wouldn't mind switching to this phone once my contract is up.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not worth the price!  it needs 2 sim cards :(", "Author": "Georgetta Arnold", "ReviewID": "R1FPLYOJSMEFYP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is not worth what it costs. it needs two sims cards before it can be activated which i had to order from walmart.com (sraight talk sim card activation kit for unlocked attat phones) and it dosent recieve good internet connection(my daughter constantly complaines its slow when browsing internet).
