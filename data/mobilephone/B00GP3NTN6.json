{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LOCKED....LOCKED....LOCKED....A Good LOCKED $19 Metro/T-Mobile Smartphone - Will NOT Work Outside of USA", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R18UY2AHE2JPNF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "WARNING:LOCKED...LOCKED...LOCKED:  The T-Mobile/MetroPcs Evolve is LOCKED to T-Mobile/MetroPcs in the USA.  This version of the Evolve will NOT work on AT&T.;  It will NOT work in South America, Dubai or Singapore.The Evolve is currently just $19 at the MetroPcs website and at Metro neighborhood stores. It would be a average phone for $100, but it is the best $19 Android phone in the world.The version sold for T-Mobile is LOCKED to T-Mobile and the version sold for Metro is LOCKED to Metro. Both versions can be unlocked after 90 consecutive days of paid service.The Evolve can connect to wifi and stream Netflix movies. Its 3G is not fast enough to stream video but it is fast enough to stream music from Pandora radio or Spotify. The four inch screen is easy to read with good color and contrast. The Evolve's small size makes it comfortable in your hand and in your pocket pocket. The soft touch coating provides a more secure grip.The Evolve's tiny internal memory requires you to install a micro SD memory card on \"Day One\" and set the SD card as the default for storage. You should transfer large apps to the SD card and uninstall updates for the apps you never use and then disable them in the apps menu.You must keep at least 200mb of internal memory free for your phone to operate smoothly. The \"one star\" and \"two star\" ratings for the Evolve are the result of people not leaving enough open memory for the Evolve to work properly. You can move many large apps, such as Netflix, to the micro SD card and apps that you don't use can be disabled after you uninstall their updates.The battery charge lasts only two or three hours if you are watching videos or using the GPS to navigate. Keep wifi, 3G, Bluetooth and GPS turned off until you need them. Keep the screen brightness at the lowest possible setting indoors. That enables you to get about 12 hours per charge allowing for some texting, downloading email, and some short phone calls.You can extend battery life to up to 24 hours by disabling the \"bloatware\" pre-installed by Alcatel and T-Mobile. I have listed the programs to disable at the end of the review.The camera lacks a flash but its takes good photos outdoors in bright sunlight. On a rainy day, set the camera's light balance to \"cloudy\" and lock the ISO at 200 for \"okay\" photos.Double open internal memory and double battery life by disabling bloatware on your Evolve. Go to \"settings\", \"apps\", and then \"all apps\". For each app, uninstall updates, uncheck notifications, then check \"disable\". If decide later to use an app, you can check \"enable\". The useless apps include: Android wallpaper, Black Hole, Bubbles, Face Unlock, Hangouts, Live Wallpapers, Movie Studio, Music Wallpaper, Phase Beam, My Metro, My T-Mobile, Swype Keyboard, Talk Back, Word Clock, Chrome Browser, Google Books, Google+ (Google Plus), Google Games, Google Magazines, Google Movies, and Picassa Uploader.These apps clog your memory and several run even when you are sleeping to drain your battery. Disable them on \"Day One\".", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "unlocked?", "Author": "Jose Luis Gomez Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "R2DPT1143KY1M7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sold as an unlocked cell, and is not, to get my product to its destination (Venezuela) does not work with any carrier.

Fisher", "ReviewID": "R2WC3P2GM2VTGP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought it to replace a really nice Android Smartphone (HTC One) that I ran over with my car and shattered the screen. It worked, but the screen bugged me. I bought this because it was inexpensive (cheaper than the repair by half) and it has bluetooth, etc. The problem I have with it is that apps close down at random, you have to click an icon several times to get it to open in the first place, and it's incredibly sluggish when using the touchscreen. Sometimes it doesn't respond at all to touch. For example, I tried to respond to a message on FaceBook lately and it just WOULD NOT bring up the keyboard. Or it would come up for a second and disappear repeatedly. Having been used to a good phone, this one is extremely frustrating. I would recommend it only for children or people that use it just for talking/texting. My 12 year old was even frustrated using my phone the other day, because the apps just don't work.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Alcatel One Evolve", "Author": "Darlenys Pe\u00f1a", "ReviewID": "R2446CXSTXDBYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this classification because the cellphone is amazing, excellent warranty and easy to use.
