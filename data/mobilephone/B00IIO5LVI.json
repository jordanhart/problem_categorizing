{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's a great phone!", "Author": "Mende Mui", "ReviewID": "R3TLNECEQRZ8HW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually placed my order reluctantly because I didn't know whether it was a great investment or not... There were no reviews except the quick overview from Android Central (forum) but I decided to make the jump anyways.The Good Stuff:Surfing: This phone is fast; just because it doesn't have LTE doesn't mean that your aren't going to get great speeds. As long as the carrier has good coverage, you are good. In addition to this fact, this phone is probably the easiest phone out there to set up because I got it to work with at&t; HDSPA+ in less than 5 minutes, and it has been working for me ever since. Even the guy working at our local At&t; had some doubts at first but then gave it a nod after playing with it for a while (\"This phone is worth it\" he said). I watch YouTube videos with ease, and play my flac music while browsing at the same time with no hick-ups.Music Sound:This phone is a Gem when it's come to music; I hated my Ipod classic because the sound was just flat to me so I had to use an FiiO amp just to make it work. I was worried that I would have to buy another phone if this phone sounded just as flat but I was wrong. It's the sweetest sounding device I have ever heard. My first song was \"someone like you\" by Adel and then played the song \"let her go\" by passenger. Mind you I'm using klipsch in ear headphones and I could hear the music like never before because the sound stage is winder but richer. So I'm just going to move on now...Battery Life:It's great for me; I have been using it daily for music (almost 18GB of flac on there), youtube, facebook, browsing the internet, some games etc. and my battery still lasts longer than a day.I said longer than a day because I do't even track it consciously hence I'm talking about it in my review because I came across a review of the 16GB version (the buyer wasn't happy with the battery life).  I found out that the phone was too bright for me so I had to turn it down a little but it's still bright enough outdoors.Quality wise:It's awesome, It's cost  me $299 and after buying this phone, I decided to buy another phone from the same company for my girlfriend (she wanted mine :) ). The 1080p screen is vibrant and very responsive. I held it in my hands for a while and I just could tell this was a good phone even before turning it on (I was right). Blu also gives you a protective case, a screen protector, headphones, and a charger.I will conclude my review by saying that I tried to find something bad about the phone but I couldn't honestly find one; the only thing that frustrates me right is that there are no available screen protectors out there for the one x at this moment in time. I'm not going to blame the phone for being new and having no third party accessories.  I also knew that it doesn't come with android kitkat and I didn't include it in my review it would pointless. Blue promised to release updates by the end of may.The biggest plus for me: I don't have the same phone thousands of people have on campus, and they have to upgrade every 6 months or so just to stay cool. I have a blue life one x and people just can't figure what kind of a phone it is. I like it that way.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT PRODUCT MORE THAN WHAT I EXPECTED", "Author": "jose alberto", "ReviewID": "RK43KC39ZKY3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm solprendido with this phone really became more than I expected .

I wanted a phone that I could use for a few years and not have to worry about it becoming completely obsolete within six months.PROS:-Great sound quality when listening to music.-Comes with a jelly case, earbuds, and a screen protector.-Even though it doesn't have LTE capabilities, I still get pretty fast speeds when I'm not connected to Wi-Fi.-It has dual unlocked SIM slots. I easily set my phone up with service from Straight Talk using the ATT SIM card from the BYOP activation kit.-It doesn't ship with Android Kit Kat, but BLU has said that they will be releasing the update by the end of May for all Life, Dash, and Vivo model phones.CONS:-The processor is lacking a bit compared to phones like the Galaxy S4, but I have yet to find anything that this phone can't handle.-When talking on the phone, if you're outside and it's windy, it can be a bit hard to hear.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, especially because I connected it to Metro PCS", "Author": "Cesar Gil", "ReviewID": "R3F03YY4QWT6EG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great looking, speedy phone.

The 13 mega pixel camera is useless because all the pictures are condensed and grainy when sent through messaging. It had some bad design faults but worked fine for three months before completely shitting the bed. When I tried to contact the company in Miami, their voice mail was full, and their problem questions on their page was vague, on trouble shooting. Thank God I bought an extended service plan on this, or it would have been a complete loss of $300.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone for the price", "Author": "Roderick", "ReviewID": "R22TGNOGA3XO1H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm loving this phone. The pictures are very sharp, clear and colorful. The speed is very fast. It came with it's own screen protector, headphones and charger. Once I connected my Gmail account it loaded a lot of things super fast over my Wifi. The 4G and hotspot works great as well.It's been a week now and I must say I'm pleased with this phone.It doesn't come with a lot of bloated apps you don't want, love that.I don't game but I do have games for my son on it.I don't download a lot of music so I don't need a ton of space.I would like to be able to get some sort of protection/replacement plan on it.All in all this phone performs just as good as the Galaxy S phones. This one is comparable to the Galaxy S4", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Esh", "ReviewID": "RWNPZKEVQO7H2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're more of visual person than I have a review for the phone here that was done some time ago: http://youtu.be/MjOV1voG5c4You can also find the unboxing here: http://youtu.be/K4BOK46ziOkThis phone is the definition of price to performance for me. 5.0in IPS display, 1.5Ghz Quad Core, and 2GB of RAM with 16GB internal storage (which is 12GB useable space) which is plenty for all my media and apps. Due note you have 1GB of dedicated storage for your apps on top of that. All this for a little less than $300 is great.Now with that being said, being stuck on JellyBean is not great but its easily overlooked when you pick up the phone and notice little to no lag in daily use which includes my social networks, checking several email accounts hourly, heavy gaming, and texting. I use my phone A LOT at work cause we have a lot of down time right now.I'm a very heavy user and have been for years so I pretty much murder my phone battery with ease. However with this not so much. I can get about 10-12hrs out of it easily especially if I have Wifi off with little gaming. The Wifi drains a lot more than I would like but the same can be said for other phones as well. By the way this has a 2000mAh battery and its pretty good. With a ton of gaming and youtube, I get to %15 in about 7hrs.The screen being IPS is great even at odd angles. There is very little light bleed as some have complained about. Coming from a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, my eyes are very appreciative of the bigger display and finally being able to play my YouTube videos in full HD is a joy. The colors are decent (not the best) and the sound is nice and loud.Speaking of HD YouTube, I've had no problem since the day I got the phone playing my YouTube videos in HD. The phone gets great signal for me down here in Houston, TX and my speeds are 15Mbps down and 2Mbps up. Plenty for my needs and it really makes LTE pretty irrelevant for me since I don't stream Netflix or anything.The LED notification light is pretty much green when any notification comes in and red when its charging. That's it. I've tried changing it with apps but none have worked for me so I don't think it can be changed at this time. I'm pretty sure that's a fault of Android 4.2. Let's talk about that quickly as well.Back on May 1st, BLU had promised Kit Kat for a big range of its devices including the Life Series which would be this phone and Blu's current flagship series, the Life Pure lineup. The date came and went and all anyone got was the FaceBook update stating \"They haven't forgotten about Kit Kat\" and that they would now release it in June. Well, that's about a week away as of this review so we'll see if that holds true or not but is a major concern that it's taken this long in the 1st place. They've been loading JellyBean onto their devices for a long time despite other manufactures always trying to keep the latest on their devices even though some are just as slow to update depending on how well the device sells. I surely hope they keep their word this time. However, as I said before, its not a big factor to me due to the hardware in the phone really keeping it snappy and Kit Kat will only make it faster when it comes out.In conclusion, the Life One X is a perfect price to performance for anyone coming from a low-end to mid-end range phone and it's very nice to see such great performance and specs at this price point. If you can't afford the the latest and greatest from your respective carriers (besides Verizon) which will set you back at least $500-$700 than you're no longer stuck with slow crap phones. Blu along with other manufactures whose products can be found right here on Amazon are worth a look or two. The Life One X is worth every penny and I'm very happy with it.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Good Phone.", "Author": "Aref", "ReviewID": "R2FW75OPPI29J7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed to a phone with dual sim capability so I select this model, very beautiful design, it works fine.The camera itself is very good (13M) but the software is not, so just download \"Better Camera\" form Google Play to get a awesome photo in day and night by this phone.Battery life is fine.

The screen is 1080p, and it's bright and nice. I matched it with StraightTalk, and while it's not 4G, it's definitely fast enough for our needs.The two bad things about the phone are 1) it's Android 4.2, not Kit Kat...at least not at of 2-18-2014 (the day I'm writing this review), and 2) unfortunately, the battery capacity is very poor. I mean bad. You can just about watch the battery drain down, and it goes really fast. Don't expect it to last through the day if you do things like watch videos and surf the web. You'll be surprised by how fast the battery drops. I could live with ANdroid 4.2, but the battery problem is lethal. Even with using all the battery saving tips---like toggling wifi and GPS on and off when I need them (which means a lot of extra time spent changing settings)---the battery goes really fast.Would not buy the phone again for this reason.UPDATE: I did some tests on the battery. I streamed Flight (great movie) from Netflix over wifi. At 50% brightness and full volume (has to be full volume to hear anything...sad), the battery declined from 94% to 80% in 23 minutes. This suggests that at half screen brightness, you have about 160 minutes of video. Most movies will be less than this, so you can make it through about 1 movie before charging the phone again.Another test I did at full brightness, also Flight, suggested about 180 minutes at full screen brightness. Not sure why. The only difference between these two was that I installed the Espier launcher (makes Android look like IOS 7 ... the launcher that comes with the phone is terrible). Why this would cause the battery to be worse at half brightness than it was at full brightness, I don't know...but that's what happened.Roger", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone with minor problem", "Author": "Throy", "ReviewID": "RVUUO60KXKPRL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Nice phone for the price but the bluetooth don't reconnect back automatically if you turn on and off either the phone or bluetooth and sometimes require unpair and pair again to get it to work and try to exchange the device and same problem with the new device so its the Life One X that seem to have a bluetooth issue and can't upgrade to latest android software now only upgradable to version 4.2.1", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$279.00", "Features": "5.0 inches IPS Display- FHD (1080 x 1920)13MP Camera with LED Flash with HD recording (1080p), 5MP Front Camera\n16GB Internal Storage\n4G HSPA+ up to 42 Mbps 850/1900/2100\n1.5 GHz Quad Core Processor Android 4.2 Jelly Bean\n3.5mm Audio Jack, FM Radio, MP3 Player, MP4 Player\nThe new LIFE ONE X will delight you with its stylish design and solid construction.
