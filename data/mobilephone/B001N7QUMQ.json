It is a very good email device and it performs well as a phone and mobile Web browser.Before the Bold I used to carry a fully-loaded Blackberry 8820 (just kidding). It was one of the smartest smartphones at the time it was launched and it's not too shabby these days either. One of my kids, actually, is using it and I would be very happy with it myself if I didn't have to carry the company-issued Bold.Briefly about the Blackberry 8820:- It was originally launched as an AT&T; device.- Unlike most of its predecessors it's actually 'black' in color and I like that.- Rides on the EDGE network when available - pretty good bandwidth for emails and voice but.- Good QWERTY keyboard.- Can be set to use Wi-Fi, when available.- Supports Bluetooth.- Comes with a working Web browser and it accepts third-party such as Opera.- Allows for downloading third-party apps and I had Yahoo!Go, Gmail, GoogleTalk and Opera downloaded and performing well on it.- Many applets are preloaded: scheduler/calendar, contacts list, BlackBerry Messenger, Bricks, Calculator, Notepad and so on.- NO CAMERA- The phone can use the address book info for dialing.- Of course, it integrates well with a corporate messaging infrastructure and it works well with Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.- Practical battery life - about 2 days, 3-4 if not used a lot.- Charges through the USB port.- Elegant design.- Bright, color screen.- Speaker.- Easy navigation with the ergonomically-placed track ball.- Excellent customization: ring tones, alarms, custom folders, themes and so on.- Solid build - ours is almost 3 years old and it looks and feels as good as new.All I can say is that, if my boss told me that I had to surrender the Bold and get back to my old 8820, I would not mind too much.", "Date": "April 3, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001N7QUMQ"}}
