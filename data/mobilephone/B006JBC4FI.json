{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lg Phoenix review", "Author": "Lavalamp \"LaVa\"", "ReviewID": "R3P5H73Q2M5ARH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ive had this phone for over a year now so I think this is a good time to write a full review. This will cover basically nothing about the Android UI. The thing about the phone that is absolutely killing me is the memory on it. It came with a microSD card which is great, but i seriously doubt I will ever fill it up because very very very few apps actually are transferable to the SD card. Which brings me to a serious problem. The internal memory is garbage. The only things i have on the internal memory are: Twitter, Facebook, Text messaging, an Alarm clock, a calculator, and a backup tool. I am constantly having to clear the memory or temporally delete these few applications otherwise I can't even receive any incoming texts, emails, tweets, etc.. Other than this serious issue the phone is very good. The screen does not scratch easily. It has a very good size and feels good in my hand. The Phoenix has also shown to be extremely durable, I've dropped it a few dozen times and it hasn't broken or chipped in anyway. All in all a solid entry level smartphone for those who can find a solution to the memory issue.", "Date": "July 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good starter phone but memory lacking...", "Author": "Ed Sanders", "ReviewID": "RUY248X93FFG5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a good elementary phone for someone just starting but it has little memory free needed to run apps, it's a nuisance and you have to uninstall apps all the time there is room for only one or two downloaded apps, get the amazon app store and there is even less.

If you want something that resets all the time bash your head in and get a memory disorder because it would be less frustrating than this phone.Pros: It's sort of like time traveling because you're text messaging in the future while your phone is typing words from 30 seconds ago.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Would recommend this all the way!", "Author": "jessica", "ReviewID": "R24MQBFIFGDWGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son and I bought one for each of us.......had one before lasted 6 years with no problems ever, dropped it plenty of times, in the water too!

The phone was supposed to be dark blue, but it was silver. I'm not complaining, but it was just something I noticed. When I put the straight talk sim card in, the notification bar told me that the network was locked; I immediately freaked out. I contacted the seller and told them my situation, and told me I could get a refund, as the product was defective. Long story short, I called AT&T; and got the Unlock code.
