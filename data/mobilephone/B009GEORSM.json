Not only did I buy it online, but the unlocked, international version.  Reason is, I go to Europe every summer and wanted to be able to swap sim cards and use it there.  The phone was loaded in French with only French instructions.  No problem, I switched language right away.  Downloaded user guide from the internet. The phone came with an adapter for the charger also.  I decided to use Net10 as my phone,text and data provider.  Bought a sim card kit (Best Buy,Target) and it comes with the option to use either AT&T; or T-Mobile.  This phone uses the micro sim card which was included in this kit.  Inserted the sim card and followed the instruction to activate it and port over my cell phone number from Verizon.  After a couple of hours, I got a text message that I was set to go!  It was that easy!  Love my phone, love my service!", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy S III i9305 White 4G/LTE Factory Unlocked International", "Author": "Mplentar", "ReviewID": "R1FTO4FHX5P0MN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the GS3 was ORIGINAL and awesome just i could not fit the sim card it probably needs a micro sim but it doesn't said that", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good cel But chinese standard", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "RBHA8T460JONT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This cel is awesone.
