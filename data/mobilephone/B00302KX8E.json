When i decide to change my mobile phone it was more for the need than for style :), so after viewing some of the available ones in the market i decided to go with Motorola again.  After a couple of months using the phone i have no complains, features are great, MotoID really works!!, sound quality is good as well as the noise reduction, just took a star from the rating because the battery life is just not there, i think we sometimes expect to have more time to play around with the phone without recharging.  Overall i can suggest you all this interesting gadget.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Stephanie Haberland", "ReviewID": "R37JMI7B934PCC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone before.  I'm a construction worker and I have to carry my phone at work.  It had been dropped MANY times, not to mention fingered up with caulk, stucco, grout etc, but worked great for over a year until it got dropped in water.  It doesn't have speaker phone that I've been able to find but it has recordable voice notes which is cool as I can record anything I want to identify my contacts without hands.  The new one that I ordered was shipped/received promptly and so far has been just as great as the last one.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "rickcjmac", "ReviewID": "R2GELONDI624EK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife has had this phone for years.

The Z9 has acceptable old technology offering basic phone functions; speaker phone, blue tooth, MP3 player, clear sound, texting, strong signal but some dropped calls.  Returned the Z9 because the start up screen did not power down.  I purchased a Z9 replacement after refund was processed. There are noteworthy problems with the replacement phone.  First, NO airplane mode even though the manual says it has the airplane mode.  Second, the phone does not always power down (blank screen) standby mode leaving the screen on even after the call is completed. To reset the screen to avoid battery loss the phone must be powered down then powered up.  This is unacceptable.  The problem was discussed with Motorola's customer service numerous times.  Motorola agreed to take the phone back for repairs but I was responsible for postage costs and insurance even though the phone was acknowledged defective by Motorola.  This cost was about 1/3 of the total purchase price of the phone.  Motorola would need the phone for 7-10 working days plus mail time.  I would be without the phone for at least 3 weeks with no guarantee the phone could be repaired or loaded with the deleted or missing airplane mode.  I would not recommend this phone because Motorola's customer service is horrible.  Would I buy the phone again, NO.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Semi-Smart phone", "Author": "CRAIG EMERSON \"Why?

He loved the Motorola Z9 in the beginning because it was so simple and had great speakers. But then he started to have issues with the reception. It also started to annoy him that the battery needed recharging every single day - even when he hadn't used the phone.This phone looks beautiful and feels wonderful in the hand but it is too heavy and high maintenance because of the constant battery drain and reception issues..", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Non-Smart Phone But Poor Battery Life!", "Author": "MissB \"Child Of The Universe\"", "ReviewID": "RT6A4YO8N0L8J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a 55 year old, AT&T; diehard, who after loving my non-smart phones over the last 15 years (started out with the Nokia hard bakelite phone, went on to flip phones such as the LG's, the Motorola's)etc.  Then technology caught up with me and they would no longer work (3G & 4G technology prevailed!).  So still wanting something similiar, with a few of the features of a smart phone, BUT without the data plan, I got this \"puppy\".  I initially loved it! But the battery life is very poor.  I have to charge it every day.  Luckily I am usually somewhere (home, car, restaurant ladies room, etc.), where I can use the wall charger or the car charger for a quick re-charge!  But as a back up I re-possessed my teenager's Samsung A157 go-phone when I get super bugged about the Moto Z9n's battery longevity (or lack of). I just pop my AT&T; SIM card in either or.  I know it sounds crazy to toggle 2 phones, but eventually I guess I will have to get a smart phone in the future.  I love the Moto Z9n's camera, the video camera, the voice clarity when I talk, the hearing aid mode, (the optional fee-per-usage GPS, XM radio, etc.). Best of all(for me), the slider \"fully extended\" gives me the feel of a flip phone! In the mean time...if you don't mind re-charging this Moto's battery often, then this is a great non-smart phone! - yours truly...a semi-tech savy baby boomer.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "good purchase", "Author": "nasgio76", "ReviewID": "RP4M5FHPBN7L4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like the phone.

I bought me a second Motorola A1200 (aka MING), because my first one served me excellently for almost 4 years, and it's still functional! And I looked around for what one could still have from old Motorolas.As an aside, among phone aficionados, there is now a hunt for old RAZRs (although they are only available refurbished nowadays), and in general, the choice for those who want a phone just for calls, those who like pressing physical buttons, those who like their phones made at least partly with metal, is now severely limited. I'm not shunning away from new technology, I have both an Android and an iPhone 4S, but when I saw this baby in a TV series (the beginning of one of the episodes of \"Fringe\" - one of those victims who die horrible deaths that the Fringe team is then investigating grabbed this phone before going to a night club), I did some research and found out it's a Moto Z9.I live in Ukraine, and it's a normal practice here to have two phones/numbers. I'm using the Z9 as my second phone, just for calls, since in the modern world, you have to have a smartphone. And as a calls-only phone, basically an accessory, the Z9 shines - very good voice capabilities (Motorola's oldskool Crystal Talk), solid feel in the hand, and very good battery life after giving it several initial full discharge-charge cycles (my provider doesn't have 3G, and I obviously don't need GPS around the USA since I'm in Ukraine, so I've disabled the AGPS service (which, if enabled, uses data and consumes the battery), and the battery is a beast compared to most smartphones). The menu is old-style Motorola-illogical (with very little customizations options), so I don't know how I would have reacted if this had had to be my primary phone (we now expect them to be our alarm clock, email client, ebook-reader etc. etc.), but now, with old Motorolas almost gone, the break-your-brain menu is almost endearing when you use the phone just for calls and don't have to navigat the menu all that often ;).If you are going to order this phone (if, like me, you need a calls-only phone), please take into account that most likely you will get a refurbished handset, although it's described as new. I bought two of them, and on one of them, when I was removing the battery cover, pressing my finger on the battery cover, the M logo came off, but I glued it back on :). On the second one, when you slide your finger across the keyboard, it makes a sound like the covering sheet of plastic is also not glued to the phone body well enough, but it's not an issue since it is a slider, and the keyboard is covered by the top part of the slider most of the time (BTW, you can configure the phone to continue what you are doing, including talking on, when you've closed the slider back, which I find very handy - I prefer to talk when it's closed), and the keyboard is also recessed, so I don't think it will come off or anything. Just be prepared that you are not going to get a perfect specimen, but for a 2007 model, and almost a collectible now ;), it's a non-issue.No headset or USB cable is included, but, again, for \"tasks\" like listening to music and tasks like being online, I use an iPhone and an Android phone intermittently (in this holywar, I'm on the iSide). The Z9, however, is the perfect talking machine. (If you need text messaging on it too, look at the Moto A1200 - it has a QWERTY onscreen keyboard on which you type with a stylus).Bottom line: I warmly recommend this phone to those who like to use their phones for what phones were actually invented - talking. If you need to be online while on-the-go, get a tablet or a second (smart)phone.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad back cover , watchout !", "Author": "Motorola Z9 Unlocked GSM", "ReviewID": "R19Y63IQ7L0A06", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was purchased 2 phones for this model but the back cover is really bad , like the toys made from china  and you can't put the cover back when you open it .
