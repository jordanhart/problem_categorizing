It had features I had never heard of and it was great....until.  The dreaded \"freezes\", which require a reboot at any- given moment.  Now that still wasn't enough to make me turn my back on this marvel of the electronic age.  As time went on the \"freeze\" turned to complete screen lock down!  I did buy this phone used so I took it all as a sign of prior use and possible abuse, so I recommended this phone to my wife.  We went for a brand new out of the box i910.  Well, here I am 3 months later writing this review!  From freeze to total screen lock!  Please learn from our mistakes and \"DO NOT\" buy this phone!
