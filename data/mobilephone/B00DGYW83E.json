{"Reviews": [{"Title": "best blackberry/smartphone", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Math One\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q6KPAS3JKRBB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the BB q10 from T-mobile. Let me begin by writing down some cons, because there are very few:1. If you use a lot of apps (current iPhone or Android user), this phone will disappoint you. Many apps are not available, or are made by 3rd party companies. But in my opinion, apps are generally overrated and over appreciated. The safest app is always your \"browser\". It guarantees SSL and other security. I should never trust a banking app, for instance. Always, access sensitive accounts through your phone's internet browser.2. Smaller screen than iPhone or the BlackBerry z10. If you are used to watching videos on larger screens, then this phone is not for you. Although, I feel the screen is only about an inch smaller than the iPhone. But the Q10 has greater pixel density (336 dpi vs 330 dpi) than the IPhone 4.That's it! I cannot think of any other drawbacks.The pros:1. The call/voice quality is SUPERB! It is amazing how clear the voice of the person I am speaking with sounds. Just compare it with any phone (iPhone, HTC, etc.).2. There touch screen gestures are very useful: swipe up and left to access your communication HUB is great. Also, the ability to multitask and shutdown unwanted apps are way better than iPhone or android.3. The keyboard is the BEST yet. I can type so fast that it astonishes me. I can type a whole paragraph and not make any typos. The autocorrect/learn is exceptional.4. Finally, ActiveSync is here. So your Microsoft exchange/OWA and IMAP e-mail are fully accessible. You can access contacts, folders and subfolders.5. BlackBerry messenger is absolutely amazing. You can call/video chat other BBM users via Wifi and 4G LTE and send them text, voice, and other attachments. NO SIZE LIMITS!6. The phone is very responsive. I have used the Q10 for a month now. I never had to wait for the phone to wakeup or reboot. It has never \"crashed\". My wife's HTC android phone does that occasionally.7. Front and back camera is finally here on the BB. You can Skype!8. Expandable memory up to 32 GB (please see some responses to this post. Some users claim 64 GB).9. More system memory than the iPhone 4 (2048 MB vs 512 MB).10. Finally a note about apps. I mentioned the lack of apps in the cons. But I have all the apps I need: Twitter, YouTube, Maps, GoogleMaps (very good 3rd party build), facebook (that I care less about), Navita Language translator, Pandora (3rd party build), DropBox (3rd party), Box (alternative to DropBox), Skype, Weather, DocsToGo (word, excel, power point), Calculator (incl. scientific), Clock (Alarm/World Time/Stop Watch/Timer), QR/Bar code scanner, scanner/convert photos to PDF app, GasBuddy, Slacker Radio, FourSquare, LinkedIn, and more.If you are a current BB user, please buy the Q10 . It won't disappoint you. If you are first-time smart-phone buyer (or looking to switch from iPhone or Android), please give this phone a try. Most carriers allow at least 14 days returns. I believe you will love it.I shall update my review in a few months time.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone!", "Author": "Judith \"Judith\"", "ReviewID": "RCLSQQ0F94JNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using a BB9000 for 4 years and loved it. But it was getting old, slow, and didn't have enough memory. I looked at androids (nice, but too big) and everyone in my family has iPhones. I can't type on an iPhone, and don't like that I can't file photos the way I like. I have an iPad, which I enjoy using, but mainly for fun.About 4 weeks ago I bought a BB Q10. The first few days I explored the phone, little by little discovering it's secrets. Now I feel completely comfortable with it. The predictive typing is amazing. There are times I can type a sentence only typing a few letters. Or I can just type the normal way on the qwerty keyboard. I rarely get those crazy typos I always get on the ipad. On the ipad it will predict a word, but if you don't de-select the word, as soon as you hit the space bar it inserts a nonsense word!  On the Q10 it gives you 3 words to chose from. If you don't select one it won't insert it. It also learns what words you use most often and will suggest them before you type anything!At first I used the phone naked, carrying it in a holster. It was very comfortable to hold. But as I got to like it more & more, I felt I had to protect it, so I got a soft shell case in addition to the holster.Pros (in no special,order):Easy typing.Comfortable size to carry around.Great filing system for pix, docs, music etcGood speakerGreat integration with OutlookGood cameraEasy multitasking. You don't have to close one app to open another, or check your emails etcBattery lasts 2 days!Battery is removableExpandable memory with up to 64 GB SD card!Reader mode makes reading web sites easierToo many more pros to listCons:Small screen, but bigger than the BB9000.  Good resolution so no problem seeing it.Missing apps :-{. I don't use many, but other people do. Little by little more are appearing. The one I miss the most is the Kindle app. It is available for the Z10, but not yet for the Q.

I will be honest in saying the gestures were hard to get down at first. Now I find myself trying to do them on everything. They are very natural to me now. I love being able to screen share in BBM and I can't wait to see apple steal this feature and claim it to be their own.

The Q10 has an all-new operating system (QNX, which is so solid that it's used to run nuclear power plants). The navigation takes some getting used to. Selecting and editing text is somewhat more difficult on a touchscreen. The keyboard is straight, not curved as in the past. The keys are larger than on the 9700. Still have the marvelous Blackberry typing experience. Accept no substitutes.Pros:Connected to my WPA2-Enterprise secure WiFi network without any problems. The new web browser is THE BEST (superior to both iOS and Android in HTML5 tests). The hardware specs are very nice. Build quality, durability, call quality, security and keyboard are all THE BEST. If you're looking for a true smartphone - a communication device without peer - instead of a toy, it doesn't get better than this.Cons:This thing is brand new. Why doesn't it support 802.11ac? Limited app support, but now supports Android runtime and I expect this to improve over time. A good program is in place to help app developers easily port to support BB10. The Link app to migrate data is broken but should be fixed very soon.4.5 stars.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Q10 = glimpse into the future of mobile computing", "Author": "CA_BBRY10", "ReviewID": "R21BRGMIC5DQP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using BlackBerry for past 10 years because it is simply the most productive device, period. I was hesitant to use the Z10 because of the all touch, but after using it for a couple weeks, I was more than impressed with the new OS BB10, especially flick texting. Even so, i preordered the Q10 and have been using it since june 20, and it is an amazing workhorse of a phone. Battery life is almost 2 full days using wifi constantly. The feel of the device is really nice, soft, comfortable. It makes a cover unnecessary, but i still ordered one to for protection. BB10 already has a solid rep, and the Q10 demonstrated how BlackBerry is pushing mobile computing to the next level. HDMI output, eventually all fortune 500 employees will be carrying their PC in their pockets-- now that is innovation. Do yourself a favor and get the Q10, you know you miss your BlackBerry.update: realized that my Q10 gets email before my Gmail (desktop). Blackberry has the best network on the planet, period. Soon, it will be the gateway to the internet of everything (did you happen to catch the Q10 flashed in the latest Cisco television commercial?)update (8/5/13): the OEM BB soft-shell cover is very nice and only $10 from crackberry.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone", "Author": "Troy Dillon \"Treerollins\"", "ReviewID": "R1SOGS88ZB4ZLK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Huge upgrade over my last Blackberry (which I loved also).  I was excited about this phone before buying it, and even with that it's been way beyond what I was expecting.  To me the keyboard the Q10 offers is a must (I write loads of work e-mails on my phone throughout the day), and it's a very comfortable, large keyboard to use without making the phone overly large.  Combined with an easy to use touchscreen, and a greatly-improved web-browsing experience, I've been really impressed.  Also has all the other things you would expect from a quality smartphone...good call quality (I have AT&T; service with it), lots of useful apps, etc.  No complaints at all.For business users or anyone who does a lot of e-mailing/texting, I'd highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great QWERTY Phone", "Author": "Jorge Ravelo", "ReviewID": "RZHCRHBX9LGIY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a BlackBerry fan since many years ago, so I might not be the most objective person reviewing this phone, but I'll try to do my bestFirst I have to say, the BlackBerry 10 is definitely a great operation system; after a little practice you'll master the gestures or movement to manage the system; is fluent, stable, and very practicalThe highlights are (at least for me):-The peek motion to see if you receive a message, mail, notification or update without leaving your current application (like video, calendar, web page, etc.)-The time shift on the camera; that lets you take a really fast set of continuous photos and with a simple slide of your finger, you can select the best/sharpest one, then go to the face of the person on the photo and select the one in which the person is with their eyes open and/or smiling and the phone will combine both photos into one automatically (no other smartphone has this feature, that I know)-The keyboard; well I don't know how to explain how easy is to use this keyboard, large keys, soft to the touch, and the phone predict the next possible words that you may write, so you only have to tap on the correct one, and it also have and auto correctors that is state of the art-The bowser has a unique feature, which converts most of the web pages you'll visit in to a readable document, like in a kindle with only the text (with font size adjustment) so you'll have a more comfortable reading experience-The phone is built to last; but any ways I'll recommend that you use a cover for more protection ; )The only con that I can list is that the apps available is not that big as the ones for Android and IPhone; however, this is expected to change since BlackBerry release a conversion package so developers can transform Android App to BlackBerry quick easily; so the most popular app from Android should arrive to BlackBerry sometime soonNote: you can install some android apps, just search in the web for more information of how to do it; but is a little complicated for a regular user, so I really don't recommendedSo basically, this is a great smartphone, and if you like physically keyboard this one has no competition!!!", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice product", "Author": "Sheldon Hughes", "ReviewID": "R46MUYMG0FHSJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hesitatingly purchased my Blackberry Q10 realizing that they have not been very popular lately for various reasons. I have been very satisfied.  Texting, emailing, and contact management are far superior to Android or IOS. Global search works very well and makes it easy to find contacts, old texts, emails, etc...  The battery life is astounding for a smartphone. I easy get two+ days off of one charge with normal use.  The screen is good, not great. It should be brighter and seems to be pentile, which leaves light hatch patterns on solid colors and slightly fuzzy text. The keyboard is great, responsive and clicky for fast typing.The OS is very smooth, fast, and fluid, far better than Android and on a par with IOS.  Lack of apps will be a concern for many, but it is fairly easy to sideload Android apps. Not all work, but most do, and those that do run very well.  Google Maps does work, which is the best mapping app yet. File transfers between computer and device are easy.Call quality is superb, almost crystal clear.  Reception is great, also.  I have been getting speeds of up to 50 mbps down with AT&T; LTE.  Average speeds are in the 30 range.To sum up, this phone is a great tool.  It is not designed for media consumption; those wanting that should look elsewhere, but for the person that wants to accomplish work with his/her phone, this is the one to get.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "thuan", "ReviewID": "RSK79R6PWHSN4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using BlackBerry for past 10 years because it is simply the most productive device, period.

I've been showing it off ever since. I absolutely love this phone. The learning curve was easy. I love the hub, it keeps me so organized. This is a business phone so not many free entertainment apps are available. But it is perfect for multi-taskers, power users who want to type FAST and ACCURATELY. I am so happy for the qwerty keyboard. I would buy this phone over and over again. Oh, and i've had it for 3 months and i've dropped it a lot. Still haven't gotten a case for it and it looks brand freakin' new.My only gripe is that when i listen to music on it and browse the web i tend to place my thumb under the phone to support it BUT that is where the speaker is so it gets muffled. :/", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Impressed - Great Overall Phone for Business/Personal Use", "Author": "EZmoney2make", "ReviewID": "R32YSABXQXPLLU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this in yesterday. I have always used Blackberry phones and was using a Torch. I was afraid I would HATE the lack of a tracking ball and button belt that all previous Blackberry phones I've used had, but to my surprise this phone is really easy to navigate once you figure out the swipe motions to get to the HUB and to the apps. Not difficult at all if you simply take a couple minutes to read the tutorial in the help section on the phone.Anyway, this phone is superb. Super fast browsing, gorgeous look, great physical keyboard and good speakers listening to music. Simply put, other than the battery life that I've yet to determine how good/bad it is, this phone is top notch in every other facet. The screen is smaller than the Z10 and my wife's IPhone 5s by a good inch and a half at least, but to me it is still plenty big enough when surfing the web or viewing pictures/videos. I don't use my phone to play games so I can't speak on if the smaller screen size is really too small for the gamer experience, but it is perfectly fine for the things I use my phone for(email, texting, surfing, picture, videos).All in all, this is a great phone. I'm really hoping Blackberry survives as a company and keeps making great phones like this one because I simply HATE all-touchscreen phones without a physical keyboard and I really, really don't like using Apple products(although my wife does lol).", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "F.

In other words, I need a strong phone to type on and to do the occasional web browsing for news, amazon surfing, etc.  That said, I wanted to upgrade to a Q10 from my 9930 Blackberry.  After having this Q10 for a few days and getting used to the new swipe motions, my company decides to go all iPhone and I'm forced to return this and shop for an iPhone 5.  I'm really devastated.  Realistically the iPhone is a fantastic phone and a great mini computer, but nothing can compare to the keyboard of the Q10.  Nothing.  And regardless of what people say, the screen is great, the camera is good enough, and the browser is very useful.  You know if you're shopping for this phone the app selection is poor, so no need to comment there.

I did struggle at first with the screen gestures (should have read the manual), but the browser is lightning-fast, the Hub a wonderful idea, the visual display utterly stunning -- but as The New York Times's David Pogue pronounced, it all comes down to the phone's perfect keyboard.  I don't play games on my phone so I don't care about 'toy' apps (the BlackBerrry app store, according to Pogue, offers 90,000+ apps with Android apps on the horizon).  Where was I?  The keyboard is probably the most astonishing integration of beauty and technology I've ever experienced in a phone or tablet or notebook or telly or motorcar.  If a tiny perfect physical qwerty keyboard (with the perfect amount of clickiness) causes you to grin uncontrollably, then you have no other choice but to buy a Q10 and grin and grin and grin as you text and email and text.

The phone would randomly stop receiving calls/text messages. Also, while the phone is in this state, the browser stays in the loading screen indefinitely. I want to say it's a radio issue, and perhaps a firmware update will solve it, but the phone shows full reception when these issues show up. The only way to get the phone working again is to turn it off completely and restart.  The worst thing is that there is no way to find out if the phone is working or not because it will still show reception bars. The only work around I found is to text myself every hour and see if the messages still go through. If not, then I had to restart the phone.In my opinion, this is the most beautiful phone in the market right now and I regret returning it.  However, if the most basic functions of a phone do not work, it is worthless.Lastly, RIM (Research in Motion) may not be around much longer.  If the issues I experienced with my Q10 are indeed firmware issues, RIM may or may not roll out with updates to fix them.Sidenote: Phone was updated to the most recent firmware // phone was used with AT&T;sidenote: Quick check online shows that this same issue is happening with other carriers", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "BlackBerryQ10", "Author": "Gloria Abrahams", "ReviewID": "R23DB1YTYAUO24", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've always favored the blackberry phones.
