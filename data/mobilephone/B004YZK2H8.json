Once the touch screen goes, it's over. I can only answer an incoming call - that is all. I can't go through messages or save photos to my computer via bluetooth because I have to confirm all actions by using the touch screen that doesn't work. The keypad is good for messaging, but it would be more effective if I could scroll through screens using the arrows, especially when the touch screen no longer works. I've lost lots of photos on this phone.

We received this product in the mail just fine.  When we put her sim card in the back of the phone the back piece would not snap in place this was frustrating.  We somehow got the back piece in place even though it was a super tight fit and taking it back off as now just as hard as trying to put it back on.  Then a week later I see the slider side of the phone was dangling from the keyboard piece of the phone, upon further inspection I saw that the slider hinges came off and were useless to the phone.  Now the phone is in two pieces and useless.

I got the phone andd was disappointed. The screen was small and the navigaqtion was too complicated when it should be simple. It was annoying how the messages would pop up. It's supposedly a texting phone but the message box would be full within 70 messages. I had to delete messages constantly which just led to me to not text as much anymore. I also couldn't set any song as a ringtone anhd was stuck with very generic tones. The screen wasn't very sensitive and within two months it stopped responding.

I have just about worn it out and I'm thinking of upgrading to the new LG Xpression, which is supposedly a newer version of the Xenon.  This phone has served me well.  I do not want to pay smartphone data plan prices and still want a good messaging phone and this one fits the bill.  I'm puzzled by the other reviews talking about screen freezes and such.  I have never had any such problem and we've actually owned two LG Xenons.  The other one got eaten by the gears in our recliner and ruined the screen.  Otherwise, it was just a great as the first.  Even with 2mp camera, I find that the photo quality tends to be pretty good.  However, it's best for taking pictures of things that don't move.  :)  Highly recommended.

It freezes up on me so often that I just give up!  Navigating the web is a waste of time.  Just typing in the web address is too much work because the screen moves around with any single touch then you have to find you spot again and it is not guaranteed to stay long enough for you to type it in.  Either that or you can't get a signal.  I have never had an issue with a signal where i live.  I would rather have an old flip phone than to keep this one.

She uses SMS a lot and this phone rec'd great reviews on CNET as a texting phone. It is good for that. It is problematic in other areas. The phone has to be unlocked to turn off an alarm that is waking you up at 5 AM. We can find no way of adding a custom ring tone (without downloading it) as we've done on other phones.

Looking to buy a second for a backup since I tend to be rough on phones. If any suggestions, I wish the QWERTY was more like the Neon II. I really like my wife's old one. The space bar position and spacing of the entire board made for reduced fat finger errors. But the Xeon QWERTY features more shortcuts and hot keys which eats up space.
