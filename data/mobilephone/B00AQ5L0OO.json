Let me start by saving Verizon is the BEST service provider and Windows 8 is a PHENOMENAL phone OS.But the three 8x phones I went through @ Verizon were all the same - each time I updated to the latest Over-The-Air update, my phone went nuts - it would shut itself down randomly and not allow me to text, saying \"cannot send text - try again,\" until rebooted. I wasted hours having Customer Service hard reset each phone, hoping to eradicate the issues by removing any apps that may have caused instability.  Each time, the OTA update took the phone back to an unusable state, regardless of anything else I did on the phone.Until Verizon fixes whatever is in their OTA update, I'd avoid this one (the same issues on 3 different phones can't be coincidence). Verizon customer service is the best, tho -- after shipping me a couple replacements, they threw me a mulligan and issued me another Windows 8 Phone (not the HTC 8x) and I'm happy with my replacement.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "T-Mobile Windows Phone 8X by HTC", "Name": "Htc Windows Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AG2nfXgFL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AQ5L0OO"}}
