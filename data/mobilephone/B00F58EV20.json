The phone is great for a new comer to smart phones.  Just be sure to check with your carrier, in my case they had to download their patch for the phone before I could use their data service.  The price was right and I am having a ball.  Thanks again to Ross Cellular.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone , great price", "Author": "GSuiter \"gsuiter\"", "ReviewID": "R1WYE3SEHNFHY0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this for our sons birthday.

Selph", "ReviewID": "R1FB1TBDBHW4V0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this phone as a replacement for my husband. He was using an HTC cell phone that was very difficult for other people to understand him on. Not sure what the problem was! He has used this one for a week or so and seems to be very happy with it. Set up was easy. The only issue was, we had to order a smaller SIM card from AT&T.; This phone uses a  much smaller card than the HTC. You can get one from your carrier if needed for free.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "WIL MAY", "ReviewID": "R2U5DIOIWDJ8OF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone is excellent entry into Smart Phone models for those of us not particularly adept in this field, works quite well.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not a bad choice", "Author": "Alicia Bacock", "ReviewID": "RLYUPK1O7JRQS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had this item 3 days but have used it the way I need a ph and have had no issues that other ph caused i.e. freezing, slow connections, slow typing, slow screen switching. I do not play music on  my phones so I cannot commentl, but I did download two apps and both completed nicely. This ph is light, thin and have only needed to charge it once a day. But it wasnt completely drained. I still had 30% battery. The tabs next to search window makes it convenient to switch screens. And it is great to hit a button only once and get a response. No more stabbing ph!! One more thing..someone posted link to show APN codes. I wrote them down. Im glad my ph carrier gave me codes without asking. The posted link was incorrect. Please ask your carrier.  Enjoy your ph..I am.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Satisfied", "Author": "JACQUELINE SIMPSON", "ReviewID": "R112AF3IX3TCJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone.
