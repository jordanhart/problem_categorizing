No idea what the prior reviewer is complaining about as far as font size goes... the font size on the display is huge, and I've got it on the 2nd smallest size available. The Setup Wizard is easy to access (Menu>Settings&Tools;>Set-up Wizard) and you can configure most of the display settings by walking through that process. Disregard the earlier reviewer's font size complaints.Pros:\"Flashlight\" option - uses camera LED flash as a flashlight.. it's crazy bright!!! Wow!Logical menusMost customization options I've ever seen in a feature phoneEasy call controlsVolume can go very loud... nice featureControl of key features from front screen of phoneVery logical operationStrong reception even in borderline areasVery good battery lifeDurable, well constructed... looks like it will stand up to any accidental abuseDoes exactly what a phone is supposed to do without any goofy \"smartphone\" crapBuilt-in camera is decent resolution and acceptable qualityMemory card slot for music files and picture storageCons:A little thick, but that's part of the deal with rugged-type phonesSomewhere I read that there's FM Radio functionality.

I'm \"old school\", and didn't want a \"smart\" phone, (or the extra $30 a month for a Data Plan). After watching it for weeks, it finally went on sale for $0 with a new contract, so I jumped on it. After putting up with total cheap-O phones and poor cell service from T-Mobile Prepaid, I needed a new phone and carrier, so the Verizon deal was perfect. On to the Samsung Convoy 3...I've only had the phone since December 2nd, so this is a preliminary review of what I've found so far. I'll update it after I've had it longer. Thought I'd get my first impression out for folks like me who are need a new flip phone, but are having trouble finding many reviews of the Convoy 3.I never owned the two previous Convoys, so I can't compare. But from complaints about \"pocket texting\" and other inadvertent pushes of the outside buttons when carried in a pants pocket, the new Convoy 3 front button Lock is a big improvement. I have carried it in my pocket and have not had a problem walking around, or when pulling it out. BTW, this thing is pretty BIG for a flip phone, but still seems OK to carry in a pants pocket all day.Coming from a bottom of the line LG and Samsung pre-paid phone, the Convoy 3 is a MUCH nicer phone. It's well constructed and feels solid. Is it Military Grade tough? I doubt it. I don't find it any more solid than my wife's LG Accolade, but always thought her phone was a good quality device, much better than the newer Revere2 or Samsung Gusto that's available now. Manufacturers are putting most of the R & D, and quality design dollars into \"smart phones\" now, so finding a good flip phone nowadays is tough. The only other phone I considered was the LG Exalt, but didn't like the form factor and keys seemed cheapo. Many reviews s far rate the voice quality as very good, but I never had the chance to try it for comparison.The main screen is nice, with good resolution and clarity. The one brief time I tried it in the sun, it washed out, but I didn't expect it to stay that legible...remember it's not a Galaxy where the screen is everything ;-). The outer screen is small and a little cramped when using the shortcuts, but because the resolution is good, everything is legible. I like the outer screen and buttons being able to navigate some of the phone's functions when it's closed.Other things I really like is the customization options that were sorely lacking on my two previous crummy phones. I can't compare it to anything but my wife's LG, but seems like it has a few more bells and whistles. I don't use her phone, so maybe not the most informed opinion ;-). There is a lot I have to learn about the Convoy's menus and all the options available, but so far it seems pretty complete.I don't text, use the wireless web, or Bluetooth, so I can't comment on those features. Also, I haven't used the camera/video cam, so no idea of the quality of either. I will update those over time. As others have mentioned, the flashlight is great! Very bright, nicely defused light. I can see loving it in a pinch now that it's getting dark so early.I can't comment yet on coverage. I live in San Francisco, and so far I haven't had any issues. I will update as time goes on. As far as Voice Quality, I am just a tad disappointed it wasn't better. When I've talked to my wife on her Verizon cell, it sounded very much like we were on cell phones...clear and understandable, but slightly distorted. I have since turned down the volume and will see if that helps.Besides initial voice quality impressions, I had a couple other disappointments...I carry the phone in my pants pocket, so wanted something with a strong vibrate and loud ring. The convoy has neither. With one of the default ring tones, turned up to max, I still have a little difficulty hearing it if the speakers are facing my leg, and the vibrate isn't strong enough to help out. I'll update this too if I find another ring tone that's louder.This is my First Impression review, and I will update it after I've lived with my Convoy 3 for a while as I'm sure I will have more informed opinions about it then.1-18-14 Update:Here are a few things I've noticed about the Convoy 3 since I've had it a while...1. Announces Caller I.D. via speaker before phone rings. A little difficult to understand who it is when it's in a pocket, but nice feature if it's not.2. Flashlight is really handy! When you activate it from the outside buttons, it only stays on a short time, but when activated with the phone open, it stays on. Just don't shine it in a  friend's eyes ;-).3. Photos taken in good light are really quite decent. Low light is more a challenge (not so great for sunsets when a flash won't help). Bluetooth transfer works fine.4. Speaker phone function works with phone closed...yeay! Answer an incoming call by holding down the right spine Speaker button, and a start talking. No need to open the phone. The speaker has  as much volume as I've needed so far.5. If you want to check time, battery level, or whatever the outer display info shows, simply hit one of the outer buttons and it wakes up. Old flip without outer buttons had to be opened to  view missed calls, battery level, etc. You have to unlock the buttons to use the menu, but for a quick glance at info, it's a nice touch.6. No pocket texting, or any volume level changes, etc., from accidental button pushes.7. Battery life is good...I may talk 15 minutes max a day, very few photos, flashlight or speaker use per week (give or take), and I've been getting around a week between charges.8. I don't text much, but font size could be a touch larger. I can still read it without glasses though.9. Missed call reminder ringtone is nice, and programmable.10. Vibrate mode is almost too weak to be useable in a pocket. WTF? A \"rugged\" phone with a wimpy vibrate mode? C'mon Samsung!11. Wakeup delay of a couple seconds when opening the phone to make a call makes me wonder if it's on or not.5-8-14 Update:A couple things I've noticed that are more negative :-(.1. Tone of speaker is too warm or muddy, at least for me. I wish there was a Tone control to add treble. I'm sure my years of listing to Rock music at too high of levels has killed my sensitivity to higher frequencies (my mom told me this would happen!), but I find my wife's older LG Accolade has clearer call quality.2. Coverage could be better. Again, compared to the wife's Accolade, the Samsung Convoy 3 loses signal easier - not a lot, but occasionally it drops a call in a spot the LG wouldn't.3. I've been texting more, and the fonts really need one size larger. Seems like Samsung could address this with a software update, but I'm not holding my breath :-(.4. A lot of difficulty getting the thing to connect to my computer via USB to download video or multiple photos - picking out a bunch of photos on the small screen is tedious to do via Bluetooth.A couple positives :-)1.Outdoors in good light, the camera is pretty good. You won't confuse the photos with a good digital camera, but now I don't miss my Canon Elph as much or always feel the need to drag my bigger camera around.2. Speakerphone is nice and loud, and to me, a little clearer than the regular handset speaker (as long as the volume isn't cranked up TOO high).", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone Choice for Talking: Seniors & Texting is Optional Also", "Author": "kath", "ReviewID": "R3R369DPTJMYNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the older person who wants to just talk, expects durability, and likes to hear better from a phone this is the one on the market today that accomplishes all these expectations.

Then went for the \"good life\" with Internet.Already had a 28\" desk top screen, then added the 9\" tablet, and a 17\" laptop.  That cell phone screen was so small usage was limited.  Always went for the tablet or desk top with their bigger screens and much faster navigation.  Even with a stylus the phone was a hassle.My two yrs went by plus two more.  Finally I asked myself why am I paying $2650 for each two yrs contract?  After looking at what was popular found the Convoy.  It was so successful it's 3rd version was now offered.  Still wondering about $10 or $20 a month for texting??  Maybe just pay .20ea text?  Often when I send a text to friends I still call them to work out details and misunderstandings.  Plus calling seems so much more personal even with clients. Been studying the Internet Convoy 3 manual couple days now.  Pretty straight forward and I like it's simplicity and saving about $50/mon on our two phones.  $600/yr matters to us and I still prefer the desk top 28\" or sometimes the 9\" tablet.Another plus for my wife and I is how clear the voice is on the Convoy.  Way better than the Samsung Galaxy ever was.  Convoy is built tough so no cases or pouches or screen savers.  Dropping it a few times seems to be ok according to users??Four years and $1200 wasted on Iphones.  Some do lots of business on them and good for them.

The camera's picture quality is much clearer than the Barrage. As other reviewers have noted, there is a slight delay when opening the phone before the screen comes on. As a society we have been trained to expect instantaneous results, but I don't believe that this delay is an issue at all. If you can't wait one second for the screen to appear, you'd better be needing to call 911. I have used this phone to make/receive calls and have had to call it from another phone. The call quality is very clear, in spite of background noise. This phone has a very, very bright LED flashlight, which could come in quite handy! The built-in music player doesn't get used, so I can not comment on it or how using it affects the battery. We also don't use the Push-to-Talk feature. Most of the generic ring tones are bit on the \"girly\" side, but all the phones we have seem to be this way. I paired this ruggedized phone with a \"Turtleback Case Leather for Samsung Convoy 3 U680 Flip Phone Case with Rotating Belt Clip, Sold by Leather Pro Store\".
