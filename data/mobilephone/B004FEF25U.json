{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Decent Basic Phone", "Author": "Andy", "ReviewID": "R3TNAMR74S3ZM0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this guy up after my beloved Samsung T-509 (it won't let me product link it) started to die after five years of trusty service. My last few phones had been Samsungs, but I didn't find one that was cheap enough for what I wanted.I just needed a simple phone I could use for my T-Mobile service. I don't web browse on my phone. I don't really use my phone that much to begin with actually, so while I had a normally billed plan, I was planning on switching to prepaid as I discovered it was $10/mo cheaper, and didn't lock me into a contract. My first ever cell phone(s) were Nokias, so I figured I'd go back to my roots and pick this one up.Long story short, it does exactly what I hoped it'd do. All I needed it for is calling and occasional texting. While I don't find the texting to be quite as intuitive as it was on my previous Samsung phones, in all fairness I have to concede that that might be due to the fact that I'd had Samsung phones for several years, and my first forays into texting were on them - they were all I ever knew.The only gripe I have with this phone, besides the aforementioned texting learning curve, is that there's just a tiny bit of lag time for it to execute a command. It's not terrible, but it is noticeable. Oh, and the camera isn't much. I daresay my old T-509 had a better camera, and it was five years old! But then again, I wanted a basic phone, that is what I paid for, and that his what I got.What I like about the phone:Battery life - I'm not sure if the claimed 10.6 hrs of talk time is accurate, but it is a solid batteryMicroSD - I can put pictures and music and whatnot on there, and use them as my background, or ring tones (free, simple, and unlimited possibilities), or play them through headphones (standard head phone jack!)Radio - A feature I'll probably never use, but is kinda cool. You HAVE to have the headphones plugged in for the radio to work as they are the antenna, but reception was surprisingly solid when I was testing it. However, you can't play songs from the radio on speakerphone for all to enjoy the way you can with songs off the MicroSD card.Small - Fits in my jacket pockets well, the keys autolock to avoid too many pocket dials.I had no trouble getting it to work with my T-Mobile service. I just popped in my SIM card and it worked. I did have to call T-Mobile tech support to have them help me with SMS messages, which weren't going through or coming in. They had to send me some text that wrote some settings to the phone's memory, but it was quick and painless. It also survived the conversion to prepay and is working just fine on that plan now. For $50 I'm fairly satisfied.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little Dumb Phone For Doing Something Old.......Talking", "Author": "Wiz \"Tom S\"", "ReviewID": "R3OD3RAK1L5KAB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great little basic Cellular Phone.

While it's great to have a camera, radio, mp3 player, qwerty keyboard nearby, to me the most important feature of phone is how is functions as a phone.  This one is perfect for making and taking phone calls on. As silly as that may sound, I cannot say enough how much I abhor trying to hold an I-phone up to my ear for any length of time.  It just doesn't feel right. This one has a great feel to it.  Very sleek and discreet. Big clean display relative to overall size. Nice audio quality and still slips into your shirt pocket without you even knowing it's there.

So it was a real plus when she told me that she really like the phone. I was just looking for a good basic reliable phone, and got many more features than expected. I knew that it had a music player, but the 5 mp camera was icing on the cake. If you're willing to spend more, I'm sure there are better phones.

From being left in the car all day in the sun, from time-to-time, the Phone has also survived countless drops, from desk to floor, bed to floor, pocket to road drops. Yes, it does look beat-up, but...all the buttons are still in place and they all work. The only issue I am now seeing is the response time, going from home screen to whatever your choice, be it application or checking your address book. Not a big problem.There are no dropped calls issue or problems with the signal.The upper part of the phone heats up during long conversations, but this is to be expected and conversations were either transferred to speaker or ended to avoid too much RF exposure.Multimedia was not used.The phone is very good and you will not be disappointed in using this phone as your first or as a backup.There were no problems with Amazon or with the shipping of this product.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone, great price", "Author": "M.

Sound quality is good, reception is typical and battery life good. One review that complained about the speaker being used for the ringer has not been a problem for me. You really can't hear the caller unless you have the phone to your ear, at least no more so than any other phone. The little slot cut on the outside for the ringer sound is easily covered with your finger while you are on the phone if it really concerns you, not a deal breaker for me.It has a few extra hidden gems that will surely please. One for me is the FM radio sounds great with a good pair of ear buds or headphones. You auto scan for stations and then select previous or next station to switch. Note that the USB connector is a micro type B port connection, not the mini type B that you find on most cameras and hard drives.

I searched several sites and spent at least two weeks reading product reviews.  Not all unlocked phones are compatible with my cell phone service, so it was important that I get this right.  I liked the appearance and options this phone offered and because I trust Amazon, I decided to buy it.My son loved the phone the minute he opened it and it worked perfectly.  Two days later, however, it became unregistered.  I contacted our service provider and the customer service representative thought it might be the phone.  That made no sense to me since it had worked for two days.  She brought a supervisor into it, and after a couple of downloads to the sim card, the phone turned on and has been working beautifully ever since.The phone has a one year manufacturer's warranty.

By comparison, this phone is vastly superior to the Samsung Gravity it replaced, especially in terms of user experience.My phone arrived quickly and was in fact unlocked; it worked immediately with my T-mobile sim card. It's easy to use, easy to program, and the call quality is fine. Battery life is more than acceptable: I leave the phone on 24/7 and charge it twice a week at most.

While the reception wasn't as far-reaching as my Blackberry Bold, for a cheap phone it held up really well on AT&T;'s network and had bars even in the depths of large supermarkets where I'd had problems getting reception.  Call quality was exceptionally clear and crisp with no echo or interference.- Small candy bar body, lightweight.  It's plastic but it doesn't feel cheap.  Screen is nice and bright, clear and easy to read.- Texting on this phone was surprisingly easy -- the predictive texting was quite good and I have not had to correct it very often.- Easy to set up for AT&T;'s network for both voice and SMS/MMS.  Did not set it up for data use, so YMMV on that.- Like all dumbphones, extremely good battery life -- standby lasts for several days and I made 4 30+ minute phone calls without making a significant dent in the battery bars in one day.- Does conditional and unconditional forwarding if needed.- Navigation square button is very easy to use, the rim of the square are four separate directional buttons you can use in navigation as well.Cons:- Unlocking the screen is annoying and I can't seem to set it to something else --- have to click on the navigation square, pause a tiny bit, then hit *. If you do it too quickly or too slowly you'll have to repeat it.Conclusion: Fantastic for a cheap, unlocked GSM phone.  Can use for texting in a pinch, but I'm used to virtual/physical qwerties so it would obviously not be my number one choice.  The battery life, reception, and call-quality makes this my go-to phone for traveling overseas in GSM areas for use with prepaid SIMs.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had a slide-out keyboard + different unlock method instead, but that's kind of a farfetched wish for something this basic and cheap.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great basic phone", "Author": "retired", "ReviewID": "RJB7HJBCQP6S6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Replaced an older Nokia with this one.

Not for Europe", "Author": "Giorgio di Buja", "ReviewID": "R3T2VL48Q2YH8R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this item for a one-month bicycle tour of French-Italian-Swiss Alps where power will often be unavailable. The Nokia website specified 10.5 hours of talk time, but sneaked in a quote of a better battery not supplied in this package. The better battery is 1080 milli-Amp-hours, the standard is 800 milli-Amp-hours. The better battery needs the more powerful AC10U charger.This charger has a miniUSB plug. But the C1-01 cell phone does not charge through the USB port. So long story made short is that this item is not as advertised, hopefully everyone will read this review, and it will function as a warning. Also the Amazon website for the phone does show in a sidebar that this phone is not for Europe, even though it has the 900/1800 frequencies used in Europe.Be warned, dual-band phones may not work in Europe. Make sure you have, at least, a tri-band or better a quad-band phone to avoid a horrible surprise when you get to Europe and your phone does not work there. Even before the C1-01 arrived, I ordered the Nokia C2-01.5 which does charge through the USB port, has a better camera, and is both GSM and CDMA compatible. Amazon refunded the full $78.95 that I paid. Part of this is shipping cost. Some international SIM card providers do not list the C1-01 as compatible with their SIM cards, because the C1-01 is not compatible with European GSM.

I made a video recording (3gp) the other day-off a fully charged battery- which recorded for 7 (seven) hours.  The battery will record audio (amr) for 10 to 15 hours without the ac adapter being plugged into the electric.The point is that there are no time limits on the recordings.  You end the recording manually or the battery runs out.And, if you record while the ac adapter is plugged in and have a large size micro sd card you could probably record for a couple of days.Ok, I'm a gadget person.The phone will hold up to a 32 gb micro sd card.  With the usb cable, transferring data to a pc is time consuming.  Better to use the adapter card that comes with micro sd card if your computer has a slot for it.The backlighting won't turn off when recording video.

I am pleased with my purchase, but would not be if I had spent full price.  First the positives: Cheap, lightweight, good battery life, sound quality seems good, fairly loud speakerphone, and camera.  I had to contact t-mobile and they give you a setting under your \"personal configuration\" that is required to get MMS working (pic messages).  This took 2 attempts, as the first time T-mobile said they didn't know how to fix this and I needed to contact Nokia, which was not true.  They are not used to dealing with unlocked phones.  The negatives? The screen is too small and low resolution for pic messages to show up well.  I don't think this is a problem with the camera as much as the cheap screen, as picture messages received from other people still show up fuzzy on the tiny screen.  The camera resolution is several times what the screen can display.  I purchased this phone to replace a bare bones Nokia that did not have pic messaging, and this barely does the job.  Next time I would buy something a little nicer.  Another problem is that my third party headset does not seem to work (the other party cannot hear me) but the included Nokia headset does.  So apparently they use a proprietary headset.  I would like a phone a little nicer than this.  The only problem is the C2 has the same low res screen, and the C5 costs $170, so there is not really a good option.
