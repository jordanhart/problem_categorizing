I had recently purchased a Samsung Gravity 3 like two months ago, and after dropping the thing my screen was messed up, it had squiggly lines all over the screen and the screen would freeze on me and rather then going through t-mobile customer support I decided to just shop around and I fell in love with the look and colour of this phone.I was really suprised at how fast i recieved this phone! Before the G3 I had, I had a nokia nuron which was a NIGHTMARE DUMBPHONE! All I wanted was a simple phone. Well, I am IN LOVE with this phone so far.. The look, the colour, the screen, it's not heavy nor bulky!The camera actually has a flash..and it's a 5.0mp camera..T-mobile has offered different data plans, and I got the 10 dollar plan for 200MB of data which is fine for me because i dont use data very much but I went on the web on the phone and its actually pretty decent.. It beats the nuron by a long shot.. Texting is very easy.. You can text using qwerty. Phone calls are clear as day.. You can also use it as a MP3 player.. This phone came with a USB cord to upload music, haven't tried doing that yet! But all in all, I am really liking it and I rate the phone a 10!*~*Update*~*Had this phone for awhile now, the camera SUCKS!!!!!!! The flash is bright.. It doesn't take clear and clean photo's. It kind of distorts the colour a bit... I tried going into my camera settings and switching some things around.. It helped a little bit, I have taken flash off it helped some what, but it still distorts the colour of the image and it takes forever for the pic to be taken.. Also you have to go into settings on camera everytime you wanna take a pic to change them, no option to save changes, that kinda sucks... But I am not gonna down grade my rating because of the camera, it's not something I use all the time... Other then that, I STILL LOVE the phone :-)Oh and I have used the MP3 player on the phone... I LOVE it.. you can use the music you upload on your phone as ringtones... Its awesome..Also, for those with the myfaves plan, this is a myfaves phone just incase anyone was wondering.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "ok", "Author": "Sky Diva", "ReviewID": "R3PCJEWOCPIWTD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone works perfect.

Every time I receive a phone call, my screen is black, does not show who is calling. It'll say your text has been sent, but the receiver will tell you they didn't receive anything. When the texts actually do send, the texts are combined with previous messages from months ago. This phone is messed up in every single way. I do not recommend it.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gives a blank screen at startup", "Author": "Jon Jeffries", "ReviewID": "RN94E2W4TVNMF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Gives a blank screen at startup and only had it for two weeks!

It said it has a full qwerty-keyboard but has the old keyboard with 3-4 letters per number button.The touchscreen is a bit slow too so you need to press pretty hard for it to react.I did not get a charger with the phone, which I guess wasn't false marketing since nothing was mentioned about it but I thought that was standard.If possible I will send this phone back, I did not like it at all.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Way below expectations based on descriptions", "Author": "Angela S", "ReviewID": "R16SNP3X6FAJH1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Both my daughter and I were under the impression it was a more recent model and a data phone that would take apps.

The telephone comes in generic packaging so I can only assume it is not quite new.  The battery that comes with the phone is definitly not new the battery life is so bad it is frustrating.  The battery that came with my phone did'nt even hold a charge for a full day, the phone kept power off.  I like the phone itself, it is a good first time touch screen users.  I was a little afraid of the new technology android phones, plus they are way more expensive.  The phone did delivery fast, my major complaint is the battery life.  I contacted the seller about the dead battery, but have not hear from them.  I am now ordering a new battery off of amazon, I hope this solves the problem.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Behold!", "Author": "Megz", "ReviewID": "R3SZ2SYI433K0K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone a couple days ago. I got it much quicker then expected. The phone was however not working prperly when I got it. The screen wouldn't turn on when anyone called or when I made phone calls. I emailed the company and told them and they gladly are going to exchange it for me. So as far as customer service goes their great! and besides the screen not lighting up which im sure is a defect it is an awesome phone.
