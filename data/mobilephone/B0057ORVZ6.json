I can talk on it for hours and still have more than 1/2 of the charge left on the phone. I can go for days without charging after a full charge. The pictures turn out great for such a simple phone.  And the only reason I have this phone is to talk and sometimes text :) While other fancy phone users I.e IPhone users are looking for a outlet to charge their phone for an important call so they can talk.... I  just smile and think I love my simple little phone. By the way I bought an extra phone since ATT doesn't sell them anymore.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gret phone", "Author": "R.

I did not want to upgrade my phone with ATT and sign a new extended contact, so was very happy to buy this ( I already knew that my  memory cards, extra cords, and headphones would work) and was happy not to spend any more money with a product I was familiar with.

It doesn't turn on, even if I connect the phone to the charger. The unit I've received seems to be REFURBISHED because it came in an unsealed generic looking box and the battery is definitely not original Sony Ericsson. I've sent the unit back and ordered from another seller. The second unit is working well and it came in an AT&T; box with manual, charger, battery, and back cover. Call quality on phone is just fine, I can hear other line clear. Speaker is adequate. Pictures from camera is so so specially without flash. Mp3 songs must be trimmed to be usable as ringtones.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not unlocked", "Author": "lucian303", "ReviewID": "R3JFHD9C2ZH0K1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone's not unlocked and can't send MMS.
