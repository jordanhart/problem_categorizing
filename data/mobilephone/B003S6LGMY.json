{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Does it's job well", "Author": "J. Thompson", "ReviewID": "R2WQ35VYBR3ZI9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got quite fed up of having two phones in my pocket at any given time. One was for personal calls and the other was for business. Anyway the time came where I required a new phone so was weighing my options on whether to get a older android model and stick with two, or get a dual sim. I scoured the net looking for good options and came across the LG GX500. With mostly good reviews and watching a dozen videos on it I decided to take this one.So far the phone performs stably. The touchscreen, even though resistive, really is not a problem to use. I'm getting faster typing using the full querty and was able to type an entire paragraph without any errors. There is usually a slight delay when switching screens but is very minor. Of course the phone is not intended to be capable of keeping up with the likes of the HTC android beasts. However, it has something that I find more valuable than the fastest or smartest. It has the Dual Sim Standby which works great! Making or receiving calls from either sim is a breeze with better than average reception on either.Cons:1. PC Suite is a waste of time. I cannot for the life of me get it working properly and I'm a IT Tech. Always gives problems, and if the phone rings during a large sync....forget about it. You gotta start over.2. Good Java apps/games are few and far between, but then again you must understand that this is not a smart phone so your options will be limited.3. Where I live  there aren't any area codes before the number. Instead the phone only recognizes the country code. So for the phone to recognize my contacts I would have to manually include the country code on 200 numbers. example instead of 555-5555 I have to go put in the xxx-555-5555. Not much fun.I only have the phone a couple weeks now so if there are any new developments I will update later.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice but some troubles...", "Author": "cabodi", "ReviewID": "RCPODZ4PHUIV2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sometimes it get blocked when you are using any application and you have to take out the battery because you can't turn it off.....using the LG PC SUITE is an irritable task", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Average cell phone", "Author": "Leo", "ReviewID": "R10P6H0SSV5LM3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This cell phone looks nice and modern, but it's slow. Also, the LG PC Suite is a lemon, doesn't work at all. It's impossible to query the available balance of the phone and the voicemail in one of my SIM, because of a \"wrong USSD code\" message. And, even though this phone was advertised as an international version cell phone, the charger received is listed to work from 150V to 240V. What about the 120v in my country?", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "shamson", "ReviewID": "R10UW3GP787IFM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice international phone.

Sometimes it's back but mostly it just wont take pictures.  And if it does you ca't view them because the phone is so slow it hangs while trying to execute its own picture browser/viewer.  Half the time it saves pics and vids in a corrupt way that you cant view them on the phone.  Sometimes something as simple as replying an sms is impossible because \"maximum number of applications\" are running which is bull cause absolutely nothing else is running.  It's by far the slowest phone I've ever used.  My old sonyericcson t68i is faster in all respects than this piece of garbage.  There's more bugs than code in its software.  The only positive thing i can say is that it's tough to break.  I know 'cause i've slammed it into walls a couple of times out of frustration.  After gathering the pieces and putting them back together, it still makes phone calls, and everything else still sucks.  The reason for the wall slamming is that I got tired of opening it and removing the battery to unfreeze it.  The only reason I got this phone was the dual sim.  Well, the second sim slot doesn't work either even though it's supposed to be an unlocked universal gsm phone.  I'd give this several stars below zero if we had negative scores on amazon.  Seriously those chinese rip-offs that resemble iphones and blackberries but have tv, 4 sims, and whatnot, work better than this seemingly legit LG product.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very impressed with this product!", "Author": "Jilly \"covert shopaholic\"", "ReviewID": "R217H2CSBNNVTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My hobby boasts about this phone daily since he got it late July.
