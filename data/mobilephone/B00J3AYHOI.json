{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Arguably the best ONE", "Author": "WiseShopper", "ReviewID": "R2CT7BOS28TGWQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You are probably interested in buying a new phone but having a hard time choosing the right phone because of all the choices that are out there. After researching the best phones that are available or soon to be available (HTC One M8 and the Samsung S5) for weeks, I pulled the trigger on the M8 and picked one up when it was released to Verizon. The LG G3 is too far away to be considered. I can't tell you how awesome this phone is without writing 10 pages but I will try to keep it short and straight to the point. I hope this review helps you decide if this is the phone for you and why this is the best overall phone available right now. Honestly do not get the S5, because you will regret it. If you want a plastic phone that is powerful and probably the best in the Spec department, just wait for the LG G3. It is coming near the summer of this year and it will have amazing performance and the best display. It will probably outperform all phones including M8, but I will be happy with my HTC M8 because there isn't or will be any better looking phone that also has competitive specs this year.Why and who should get this phone?People who want a phone that:-Is well crafted and probably the most beautiful phone ever made (yes better design and materials than iPhone)-is one of the fastest phone currently available-Can live without having the best camera-Simply works without buggy software crashing and want a smooth android experience-Is one of the best phones available this year-Is a solid phone that is 90% metal and feels elegant to hold in your hand-Has very good battery life (not the best) but most people will be satisfied-Makes other people wish they had a sexy phone like it, even iPhone users-Has many \"cool\" features like motion launch, dual camera, step counter, IR blaster to be used as a remote for TVs and more, double tap to wake up, few other tricks that make it fun and easy to useWho should buy something else?People who want a phone that:-Is an iPhone (Apple lovers)-Is a Windows Phone (Microsoft lovers)-Is slightly faster but mostly plastic-Has an amazing camera and loves taking highest quality pictures with a phone-Has the best battery life and does not have a car charger-Is ugly with amazing performance and unnecessary specs.Skip this paragraph if you don't care to know what type of person is giving you this information:It is very difficult to choose a phone today because of all the choices that are available. But I finally found the ONE without compromising much. I want to give a little background about myself before you think I am just an average smart phone user. Like many of you I always want the hottest gadgets and especially the best phone. I honestly love iPhone's design but I hate their software and that is why I have always used Android phones. A few of my previous phones include: HTC EVO 3D, Galaxy S3, Droid DNA, Galaxy S4. I also had the Nokia Lumia for a very short period of time and I was not impressed by the phone or the Windows software. The only reason I did not get the original One (M7) is because of the lack of microSD slot.HERE I WILL LIST THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF THE PHONE WITH RATING COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES THAT ARE AVAILABLE OR WILL BE SOON:Overall Rating 9.6/10Positives:Design 10/10 : Arguably the most well designed phone available right nowPerformance 10/10 : One of the, if not the fastest phone currentlyDisplay 9/10 : Easily the top 3 displayExtra Features 9/10 : Missing few extras (fingerprint, heart rate monitor) but it has other features that makes up for it.Storage 10/10: Finally a microSD slot that supports up to 128GB and it has a 32GB model.Software 9.5/10: HTC Sense UI is the closest OEM software that is as awsome as the stock Android UI, I personally like the HTC sense more, it is smooth and not buggy like the Samsung TouchWiz. It has useful apps such as: BlinkFeed, Sense TV, and FitBit can be downloaded serperately and the sensors provide very acurate step counts.Negatives:Battery 8.5/10 : The battery life is above average but could have been a little better. Overall it's better than 92% of other phones. Not bad at all. A new update called \"Extreme Power Saving\" is soon to be released and it will help save a lot of battery when you turn it on, almost 70% increase. It basically turns off useless services and will probably increase the rating to 9/10.Camera 8/10 : Kind of disappointed because so many other phones have better cameras (iPhone 5s, Galaxy S4, LG G2, etc). There was no upgrade to the camera from the previous model. But I give it a 8 because the camera is decent and it has other interesting features that make up for the slightly low resulution. The camera is not bad by any means, its just not excellent. It is the first phone with dual camera and it can do some breathtaking and useful trick to the pictures using the depth information captured by the second camera. Overall I am happy with the camera.As you can see the phone is just too good to have extreme negatives, the negatives are just slightly below what is expected of a smartphone in my opinionBelow are more specific details of the phone, read if you pleaseDesign 10/10: \"This is the best looking phone in the world right now\" and that's a fairly accurate statement. Some might disagree but not many. The pictures does not do enough justice, it is truly gorgeous to look at and to hold. It feels like holding a metal artwork. It feels very solid and premium in my hands. I am only 5'3 and I have fairly small hands and I honestly think it is the perfect size, maybe 5% longer than I hoped for. Overall it's hard to find a well-crafted and more beautiful phone than the HTC M8, yes it is more elegant than the iPhone. Don't worry it is not all about design, it packs some serious power.Performance 10/10 : Let's just say it is the fastest phone available right now according to the benchmark tests I have done. The phone is amazingly smooth, everything just opens up instantly. I have not experienced one bit of lag or any errors. The Sense UI is closest as you can get to the stock Android UI experience with any OEM UI. The Samsung Touchwiz and LG UI is a mess compared to the Sense. The Qualcomm 801 processor is a fast and efficient processor. I can almost guarantee you that performance will not disappoint you.Display 9/10: The phone gorgeous inside out. The picture quality is extremely sharp and vibrant. It is easily top 3 in the graphic department. It is very bright and crystal clear. But there are a few phones currently out that outperform the display. My brother's LG G2 has a slightly better display. I hoped for it to be number one in this department but overall its nothing to complain about.Battery 8.5/10: With all the advances in technology I am not sure why there has been such little innovation in the battery field. It is not just cell phone batteries but all batteries in general. Some manufacture like Motorola has done decent job with providing large batteries in recent years. HTC has always disappointed me in this department and this phone is no exception. But I have to admit it is above average and I am fairly satisfied so far. I am able to go through an entire day without a problem. My day starts at 6 and ends at 7. My normal usage include: Frequent texting, 1-2 hours of talking, 3-4 hours of surfing and email, 30-45 minutes of games and the rest standby. I am able to get through the entire day but honestly most of us have chargers at work and in our cars. So overall I am not too obsessed over battery but the M8 does provide fairly decent battery life. Most of the tests reported a full day of normal to somewhat heavy use and I can confirm that. It was supposed to come with a setting called \"Extreme Power Saver\" but apparently it will be provided soon with an update. It supposed to limit the phone to only email, phone, text and few other basic things to save a lot of battery. Supposably up to 70% more battery. I can't comment on it until I receive the update.Extras 9/10: What's a flagship phone without some tricks? The M8 has some cool tricks up its sleeve.Camera Affects: I will complain about the camera quality later but let me state the positives in this section. Basically the camera has some tricks that help me deal with the moderate quality of the images. My brother has a$1200 DSLR camera that he uses to take cool pictures and I can do the same now with my $600 new phone. My favorite feature is the U-Focus which blurs the background and focuses on the object, like your face. Obviously the DSLR camera does an exceptional job but most people can't tell the difference with the first glance. The second camera on the device captures depth information and you can add cool affects to the pictures after you take it using that information. There few other ones like Sketch and Cartoon and Zoom effect but I find the U-Focus to be the most interesting one. But most people will use all of them because they work very well and are very easy to customize a picture.Motion/Sensors Stuff: My favorite trick is double tapping the screen to wake it up and turn it off. It's amazing how this simple feature can be so useful. I hated pressing the power button to turn on the display and now all I have to do is tap the screen. I can also swipe from the bottom to top in order to unlock the device and go to the last app I had open. You don't have to go to the lock screen, you can directly go to the home screen if you don't have a passcode setup. Swiping from right to left take you to the awesome BlinkFeed screen. Swiping from top to bottom brings up google now (voice command). Swipping from right to left take you to the home screen. The final motion trick is answering the phone by simply lifting the phone to your ear. Thre is also a feature where you hold the phone in landscape orientation and press the volume up to activate the camera app.FitBit App: The phone has a built in barometer and bunch of other sensors that can track your steps very accurately. Most phones have some of the sensors but only the iPhone and Nexus 5 has all the sensors like the M8. As a result the M8 and the few other phones can track your steps very accurately without buying a pedometer like the FitBit Flex or Force. The FitBit app was supposed to come preinstalled but you can easily download it from the play store for free. I am currently using it to track my steps and its about 96% accurate.Remote for TV and more: The M8 has an IR Blaster built in, you can control all your electronics with your phone. HTC has this app called \"Sense TV\", it's very interesting and useful. You basically select your cable provider and select the channels you have and the app gives you show times and what's currently playing based on your favorite stations and shows. Basically it's a smart guide on your phone and you simply click on the show and your cable box will bring up the show. The setup is easy, you simply select your cable box model, TV model, home theater model and you can control all of them using your phone. But I highly recommend getting this app called \"IR Smart Remote\", it's about $6 and it is the best remote app for your phone. You can basically throw away all your remotes and use your phone to control everything; it does a very similar job as the Harmony remotes. Do some research on it, you may like this app.Camera 8/10: Compared to all the other phones available, I am very disappointed at with the picture and video quality of the main camera. It is the same exact camera as the previous model except it has an extra camera. The picture quality is not bad but it is not excellent like many other phones. The main problem is the lack of resolution and bright light pictures. If there is too much light, for example capturing the sky in a sunny day might be hard; the picture doesn't capture blue sky properly. Overall it's a decent camera but I was expecting more. It is an average and maybe slightly below average camera.Final Verdict: If you want a beautiful, fast, elegant and a phone that simply works, then just get this phone as soon as you can. I know many people are comparing the Galaxy S5 and honestly the S5 has several advantages but the HTC One M8 is the clear winner to me. If you don't mind the plastic and somewhat of a bland look, then get the S5. If you want the most elegant phone that is available, then get the M8.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "iOS to Android", "Author": "YimYorm", "ReviewID": "RVBKW20LNMFM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About Me: I have been the Apple fanboy for the past few years. From the 3GS to iPhone 5S and Macbook and iPad geek. Never owned a flagship Android base phone. I am an average technology geek look for high end technology at low budget costs for good features.Impressions: Since the M7 to the M8 Leaks, I had fallen in love with the phone. The elegant and classy look just compelled my eyes. I knew I had to have this phone. The front speakers and overall appearance of the phone stole me. I went in blind to the Android world.The \"M8\": I have been using the phone for the past 5 days, and I have to say I absolutely love the phone. Everyday I learn something new about the phone and it surprises me. The fast processor loads programs in a flash then multitasking is amazing.The so called bad crappy is not of an issue to me since im not a big camera fanatic and it shouldnt be a big judgement on the phone. Personally, I find myself having so much fun with the camera from the 3D dimensions to the unfocusing and stickers.  The front speakers are really amazing sounds like concert coming from the phone. The 5 inch 1080p display is amazing to watch videos and just gaze at your phone. The slim design makes comfortable in one hand. The catches other iOS users to analyze my phone consider actually buying it. Its great phone and I would recommend to everyone. Never worry about space with the extra MicroSD slot.Pros:-Sleek & Elegant.-Front Speakers-Camera Effects(find your self becoming a photographer)-Face Recognition unlocking-4.4.2 Kit Kat-Motion Launch-MicroSD(Up 128GB)-Ultra Fast load times.- Control your TVCons:-UltraPixel Camera(sometime you can notice it, not a big concern)-Not waterproofPersonally to me no real cons.Good phone to transfer over to if your a iOS user.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "The (New)ONE to Rule Them All!", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R17OMMN1GVOH4W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love HTC phones and I have both last year's One(m7) and this year's(m8). I am NOT affiliated with HTC or compensated by them in any way. I just feel that competition and the underdog companies are crucial and essential for a healthy free market economy, and ultimately, us consumers. I have had the iPhones 4 through 5s, Samsung Galaxy S3/S4 and Note 2/3, and several Nokia(n95-97, n84/85 and several lesser phones) and Sony/Sony-Ericsson(Xperia) phones over the years, and I have loved most of them. For a healthy and positive technological evolution, we NEED the small or struggling companies like HTC to succeed. If Apple and Samsung become duopolies, that will be a dark future indeed. Pick up an HTC One(M7 or M8) and any Samsung Galaxy phones and compare the quality and craftsmanship, and tell me why it's Samsung and not HTC that have more successful phones. It's all about the MONEY and marketing, the bigger guy trying to squeeze out the smaller guy, and that's NOT how a healthy free market economy should be.Now that that is out of the way, let us get down to the nitty gritty. This is my direct comparisons to the iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 and Note 3, but mainly to the last HTC One(M7)(and yes, I am mainly updating keypoints from the m7 review):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5s is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the 2013 HTC One's(M7) screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 5.0\" 1080p(440ppi) form. The main difference between the M8 and the M7 is the color reproduction on the M8 is better and more true-to-life. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Once again, the new One continues the HTC tradition of making really high-quality phones with high-class material and craftsmanship. This version has more of a matted-brushed aluminum finish than the glossier M7. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other issue). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5/5s. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication, unlike the plastic-y feel of the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5. The One is one real looker!3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution. Compared to the M7, the M8 loses the Beats audio engineering, but it actually sounds louder than the M7, which although has really high-quality speakers as well, was known for being too soft in certain scenarios. The new moniker is just BoomSound.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick! What's really cool about the new camera is the duo camera functionality - each photo you snap is recorded from both cameras, so afterwards, you can re-focus the image, ala Lytro camera style. This is really cool and quite revolutionary for a phone camera. So in the real world, this means no more out-of-focus photos! You can now always re-focus your photos after the fact, so you will not have to regret missing out on a great memory because your photo was out of focus - awesome!5) For a phone with a 5\" screen, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 3. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance. However, it is very TALL, even taller than the M7, so trying to reach the power button with one hand while your holding it in a normal position is almost impossible. HOWEVER...6) The One borrows the features of the LG G2 where you can double tap on the screen while it's off, to turn it on! While the screen is off, you can swipe left to turn it on to see Blinkfeed, which is HTC's version of Flipboard/news reader, and swipe right to turn it on to the home screen. The one thing HTC forgot though, is you can't double-tap the screen while it's on, to turn it off, which the LG G2 CAN do.7) The user interface(UI) and software design is now even more polished,minimal, and simplistic. Sense 6.0 is the on-going improvement from the previous versions. It's really quick and light, not bloated like Samsung's TouchWiz UI. It improves on the older, but still good, Sense 5.0 and 5.5. You can move from one screen to the next lightning quick, almost as good as the iPhone UI.8) And FINALLY, HTC has included a microSD slot so you can add your own memory card for more storage(the HTC DNA/Butterfly and M7 didn't have any). You can add up to 128gb more!The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2600mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. At least it is a lot better than the M7's 2300mAh battery, which drains super quick, yet charges SUPER SLOW.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4/S5, the One is not as good. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news. The coolest feature so far for the One has been the tap/swipe to turn the screen on.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4/S5, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4/S5's fancy functions. The S5's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light, and with a more true color reproduction. The S5 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S5 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S5 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the new HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones(at least for now!).", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "ONE smartphone to keep (I know it's a cheesy tittle)", "Author": "Diego Hern\u00e1ndez", "ReviewID": "R2E5SEAJLD19R7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I begin this review, I have to say I enjoy smartphones and change phones every 4-6 months. For the past 4 and a half months I've been a Nexus 5 user, before that I had the Xperia Z1 and before that one I had the Samsung Galaxy S4, which means I will be able to judge according to what I've used in the past.I realized it'd be better if I left a summary of PROS & CONS before the wall of text:+ Premium look and feel, not as big on hands and at least for me, not really slippery.+ Beautiful and clear screen, even at direct sunlight.+ Micro SD expansion slot.+ Incredible and loud dual front-facing speakers.+ Pretty good camera after you learn its tricks and amazing effects like U-Focus when using properly.+ Sense 6.0, the best Android skin IMO, not invasive and it actually improves the UI instead of making it a mess.+ Gestures. With the help of a launcher you can actually avoid using the power button at all.+ Amazing battery, holds up from 6am to 11pm having Mobile data on and listening to music for more than 6 hours a day.- Metal unibody will scratch easily.- Terrible button placement for one hand use, which again, is fixable through other apps (Double tapping to lock).- Unprecise responsiveness of earphones/headphones controls (Play/Pause, Next and Previous track).- Camera could have been much better. I mean, it's not bad but there's room for improvement.Now, onto the review:FIRST IMPRESSIONS: I already knew what I was getting, I had read all the technical stuff and watched a couple of videos of the phone itself. But when I opened the box I was still blown away. The One M8 is such a great piece of smartphone, it's definetely a gorgeous phone because, as you probably read, it's made of 90% metal so it has that premium look and feel you'd expect from a flagship device.DESIGN: I honestly thought the HTC One M8 would be huge in my average size hands, but it actually was great to hold and the unibody gives it a great feel too or maybe my hands aren't as average as I believed! I was also concerned because I read from several places that due to its metal body it was pretty slippery; but I've had the phone for a week and not a single drop or slip so far. Although, I do have to say it is slippery when I have it on my pocket while sitting, it usually tends to slide out and I have to move it back once every while (Of course, this depends on how still you are or if you move your legs often). As much as I love the metal design, look and feel I think it's more of a curse than a blessing, because it scratches way too easily; this means you'll probably will have to buy a case if you don't want your phone to have the back side completely scratched, luckily there's a couple of case choices to avoid covering the beautiful back of it (I bought myself a translucid Spigen case).The one thing I think HTC got all wrong is the button placement, it's not logical or comfortable at all, but I will talk about it a little more in a while, along with the gestures system. But one point where HTC did great is on the memory expansion capabilities via MicroSD card, I listen to music most of the time and have around 40Gb of music on my phone at the moment, this was a big plus for me.SPEAKERS/AUDIO: Two of the many reasons I wanted this phone were the dual front facing speakers and in a couple of words: they don't dissappoint at all! They are simply the best I've had on a phone. Amazing loud and crystal clear sound speakers, there's no fuzziness or distortion at max volume here AND I can finally place my phone wherever without covering them. The only thing that kinda bugs me is the fact that they are not symmetrical, but I'll learn to live with it. In addition, I actually didn't expect earphones to be included, so I was a little surprised to see them. They're not bad, but I don't like the fact that the earbuds are red, so I will keep using my ATH-M50s and my Hammerheads pro.There's one thing I noticed and had issues with, the responsiveness of the handsfree button (Play/Pause, Next track and Previous track) with the default earphones and with my Hammerheads. It takes about one second after pressing it to take effect and sometimes the double tap action to skip to the next track is recognized as a triple tap, which takes me back to the previous track. Coming from the Nexus 5, where the responsiveness was immediate and precise, it will take some time to get used to.SOFTWARE, CAMERA AND BATTERY: I've always been a fan of Stock Android, which is why I loved my Nexus 5 and didn't quite enjoy the S4 and touch wiz; but I think it's safe to say I love Sense 6.0 as much or even more than Stock Android. It's not intrusive, it doesn't have drastic changes on the UI and it's simple enough to make it look great. I really liked the fact you can edit the quick settings shortcuts as you like and that they change colors according to the theme you choose, the same goes to the notification bar changing colors depending on the application you're using; I also enjoyed being able to change the font style of the whole phone with just a couple of taps. It's all about the little things.Talking about tapping the screen brings me to the next item: Gestures. This whole idea of double tapping and swiping the screen to unlock the phone made me remember my beloved Nokia N9, great concept. It also makes it a lot easier for the user to unlock the device without having to reach the awkwardly located power button. And since I'm a loyal Nova Launcher user I ended up configuring the double tap action to lock my phone, so now I have no need at all to reach the power button. The one thing I would have liked is that gestures wouldn't require a slight movement of the device to work properly because I tend to check my phone without moving it from my desk and now that requires me tapping the screen 4 times exactly to work without motion.The duo camera, as they call it, is pretty decent for what it is: A phone camera. You wouldn't replace your actual camera with it if you're into the matter; but if you're like me, a casual photographer, it'll do just fine. What I really liked was the U-Focus effect, I find myself using it quite often and after a while of playing with it you'll figure out what you need to do to make it work quite good. I say this because if you don't define well the foreground subject from the background or vice versa you'll end up with an unshareable picture. Overall, I have to say I'm quite impressed with the camera, but it's pretty obvious there are phones with better cameras on the market, I'd be lying if I said this was the best camera on a phone I've tried.On the battery side, most of my week (6/7 days) I get up at 6am and go to work, I have WiFi on throughout the day and Mobile Data when I'm commuting, answer mails and the occasional Social Networking usage (Facebook, Twitter, Line, Whatsapp and Instagram), but most importantly I can't live without music and because of that in my regular day I usually listen about 7-9 hours of music on my phone, . At the end of everyday, which is around 11pm for me, I have 20-30% left of battery; this is a bit more battery life I had at the end of the day than on my Nexus 5. To sum up: I can't complain about battery life at ALL.CONCLUSION: I'm very happy with the choice I made and I don't think I'll be changing phones for a good while; sure there are a couple of things I would change, but nothing drastic and nothing that'd be a deal breaker for me. Overall, it's an amazing phone and I would recommend it to most people.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best phone I have ever owned/used", "Author": "J. Viera", "ReviewID": "R21089OQL577BT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't even know where to begin describing all the ways this phone blows all others away.This phone is everything the tech sites boast it is and more. The processor in this thing makes a world of difference. Apps and widgets open in the blink of an eye, web pages load at blazing speeds and the phone boots up almost instantaneously. The last time I experienced such a leap in speed is when I first used my Samsung Galxy S3 and iPhone 4 after using a Blackberry Curve for so many years. The difference between the speed of the One M8 and S3 is like apples and oranges. A Ferrari 458 vs. a Hyundai Veloster.The display on the M8 is stunning. The screen on the this thing makes the one on the S3 look like a CRT display from 1998. And speaking of the display, my biggest (and best) surprise came when I used the phone outside in direct sunlight. To my amazement, I could see the screen perfectly, unlike my S3 (and other phones) which was impossible.The form factor of this thing is it's strongest quality in my opinion, and one of the reasons I picked this over a Galaxy S5 and iPhone 5s. You will be hard pressed to find a phone that looks this good AND feels this comfortable in your hand. I did notice the volume buttons felt a little loose, but it's not a deal breaker. The phone feels sturdy and ready for war, it feels like it won't turn to powder (iPhone 4, 4s) or dent (iPhone 5, 5s) if dropped. Although I would recommend getting a case to put it in. I haven't had any yet (*knocks on wood*), but I can see the potential for the back and sides of the phone getting minor nicks and scratches. I ordered the Spigen\u00ae [Non Slip] [AIR CUSHION] HTC One M8 Case and amFilm HTC One M8 Screen Protector 2014 Premium HD Clear. The case hasn't arrived yet, but I can say the screen protector is EXCELLENT. They weren't lying when they boasted about the clarity and protection this thing offers.The OS is great too. If you're familiar with Android operating systems, it won't be hard to adjust to this phone. Although it did take getting used to having no physical home button and navigating the menus, but that's not necessarily a bad thing (I like newness). The camera, despite what some apple fanboys and tech reviews claim, is actually really good. The images are clear and the colors are rich, and with a little tweaking of the settings, it can compete with any other camera (on a phone) out there.The battery is also a strong suit of the HTC One M8. I was initially worried about purchasing a phone that didn't have a removable back cover, but now I know it was for nothing. When I first opened the box, it had a 47% charge, which would have lasted me, but I decided to charge it fully. The next day, the phone only lost around 30-40% charge after more than 18 hours of light to moderate use (facebook, instagram, email, whatsapp, music, youtube and internet browsing). With heavy use, I can see getting at least 10+ hours. In standby mode, I can see this thing lasting weeks. Needless to say, the battery is great.Now, onto my only gripe about the HTC One M8, the speakers. Don't get me wrong, these are the best speakers on a phone that I have experienced, and having them facing forward makes a world of difference. When the volume is up, the speakers are very crisp, clear and bass rich. However, after reading so much about Boomsound, and then actually hearing the phone, I was honestly expecting a little more. I know that I have to take the audio file quality into account (which I do), but I wasn't expecting to have to turn the volume up to the level I did (almost max) to experience what HTC so proudly boasted about.After all is said and done, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants the best piece of pocket tech available.Pros:-Super fast-Very lightweight/excellent form factor.-Battery life is amazing.-Great display.-Can actually use the phone in sunlight!Cons:-Dual front speakers not as loud as I had hoped.-Volume buttons don't feel very well constructed.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Elio Aldemar Gomez Lombana", "ReviewID": "R2NZ3408JOQZLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Layout very good performance easy to use very good signal reception, the drums very durable great sounding speakers, Super Recommended", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "The New One", "Author": "Moshin Khodabocus", "ReviewID": "R19UR5PJ4R098G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I replaced my old HTC Sensation XE with the new One M8, and i must say, i'm loving it!

If the camera is not a primary need for you, this is an excellent phone and I'd recommend it to anyone.Now if you're interested in a deeper review, here we go.-DesignThe HTC One M8 is, at least in my opinion, one of the best crafted android phones out there, the quality of the materials which is built can be noticed without even touch it, and once you have it in your hand the phone gives the feeling of a premium device, just what you're paying for, since it's not cheap at all.The sleek full aluminum body costs its price in the weight of the phone though, making it one of the heaviest smartphones out there, only comparable with the Sony Xperia Z2; I previously had a Galaxy S4, which is supposed to be way more lighter due to the materials difference, however in my personal experience it's really hard to have a S4 without a case and keep it intact, the plastic can be easily scratched and the material is a fingerprints magnet, so the weight it gains in favor of lighter materials, ends up being gained again for the case. After using the M8 for a month I can say the materials are good enough to not get scratches for normal use, and fingerprints are out of discussion.As a negative point I'd say as many others, the space in the front of the logo is completely unnecessary and only adds some dead height to the phone, however you can still navigate through all of the screen with a hand in most of situations with ease.In my personal opinion, the decision about putting the power button in the top at the phone is more than accurate, I lost count on how many times I turned screen on with my previous phone while I was putting in into the pocket cause I accidentally touched the button on the edge while holding it, this combined with the gestures to unlock the screen makes you forget about the lock button, which not makes it uncomfortable in the end.-ScreenThe M8 screen it's a beautiful screen, I was a bit worried about this cause I was used to the AMOLED displays from Samsung, but once used this one for a while I should say, in my personal opinion is way more better, because color saturation is more accurate to natural tones, except for some green tones, I don't know if it's because all of the time I've spent with AMOLED screens, but they seem way bright in the M8 screen, the first time was uncomfortable and still don't like how do they seem at all. An example of these green tones are present in the google play store in the apps and games buttons, I'll add some images later from the phone so you can appreciate it.In terms of brightness the M8 has a good brightness scale: the lowest brightness is enough to light the screen while you're reading in the dark without being annoying, and the highest one is too bright for my personal like in normal light situations (cause I don't like high brightness in my screens anyway) but it's enough to be able to watch the content of the screen against direct sunlight, which I appreciate a lot considering in the same conditions with my previous phone I was just able to see some purple brights most of the time.The automatic brightness could be improved later, looks so close to the highest brightness for my personal likes.-CameraThis was one of the things that kept me skeptical about the phone cause I heard a lot of complains about the first HTC One and the Ultra Pixel technology, so I was expecting ugly and blurry photos. I'm not a huge fan of photos and I don't take a lot of them with the phone, maybe I'm not the best person to make a review from it, but the ones I've taken seems fair enough for me, the colors are good, the camera is fast and results are decent. Off course, it has the limitations of what every 4 pixel camera (being ultra or mega pixel) could have, and it's the lack of detail and sharpness as soon as you start zooming the photo. However if you're gonna take pics just for selfies, casual food hipster photos and to send some images from whatsapp or facebook (which in whatsapp case are resized anyway) the quality of the photos are good enough, there is very detailed reviews about this at Internet if you need more info about it.Duo camera bring some interesting effects, some more polished than others, the most interesting for many people, ufocus, actually works, but it's not the most polished of them, I have to say in some situations the area is not well defined, but for general purpose will behave as you expect most of times.If it's true more mega pixels doesn't fully means a better camera, it's also true this one still lacks of the minimum required amount of pixels to be at pair with his competitors, I hope they find a way to add more pixels to the camera, this would make cover the weakest point of this phone.-AudioThis topic is with no doubt one of the shiniest for HTC, last year's One was way more ahead from the rest, and this year they've done it again. Frontal double speakers sacrifices some height from the phone, making it as tall as other with bigger screens, but the sound quality is out of discussion. This year Sony got close by bringing their speaker to the front as well which improved the audio, but I think HTC is still better, and I've seen some serious audio reviews which also thinks so, but in the end it's a personal preference, none of them are perfect.-Memory and BatterySince I was using the S4, I've never been able to fill up the memory, cause I tend to close what I'm not using, I'm not the most memory demanding user over there. If you feel like fitting in my profile, 2GB of RAM should be enough for you, and maybe most of people, since in the end few manufacturers gave the jump into the 3GB scale. I've been using around 10 apps in the background with no weird behaviors, everything works as expected.Before talking about battery duration let's define my usage patterns: daily usage includes web browsing, reading books and news, checking mail, social networks and sometimes playing some 3D games, which makes me a kind of heavy user.The battery was one of the things that impressed me more from this phone. My previous phone had a 2600 mAh, which used to last in average more than 3 and less than 4 hours of screen on before battery runs out, sometimes I was close to the 4 hours, in terms of hours without having to charge the phone that meant 8-10 hours on the heaviest use I gave it, 12 average and having power saving options on except for processor one, 14-16 on light use and around 20 hours using power saving additional options, being that the record I got with that phone.The HTC One M8 comes with a 2600 mAh battery too, in terms of screen on hours before the battery runs out, it lasts in average more than 5 hours and less than 6 and I've passed the 6 hours sometimes. In terms of hours without charging the phone, that's around 14 hours on heavy usage, 16-24 hours on lighter usage and up to 40 hours on weekends when I use the phone the less, without using any power saving option, and being my current record on this one. This 'no power savings' statement is a bit tricky though, cause the HTC One M8 turns power saving settings automatically when battery is lower than 15%, however if you consider my previous phone had them always on, it's a huge step forward for the same battery capacity, and this is where the optimization from title comes from.-SoftwareHTC sense is extremely non intrusive personalization layer,is fast, fluid and minimalist. The applications have these same patterns and tend to add some color to the equation (not so many for application though) this can be a good or bad thing, that depends on your likes, I'll add some screenshots of the apps later. I won't add benchmarks test to talk about performance cause they've been tricked some generations ago, but in normal use around this month I haven't experienced any heavy lag, or delay which makes the phone uncomfortable to use. The phone is fast, you can feel the difference between the sanpdragon 600 and the 800 series, it executes everything smoothly.Saying there's a phone with no lag at all anytime is a beautiful lie, I've seen random lags, freezes and delays even in iPhones; this is not the perfect phone, however they barely happen, at least with the time I've been using it and with the usage I've been making of it, you can't compare it to TouchWiz, that's miles ahead in terms of lag and delay competition, even if that's not a good thing.A real downside and a bad thing of this non intrusive UI I've found is, however, the lack of a default file explorer. Android doesn't has any, and HTC won't include anyone either. If you don't use a SD card in your phone that won't be any deal, you just need to pick the one you like more from the Play Store (there are a lot, with beautiful and polished UI and a lot of people make their default from there anyway), but if you have a SD card this will mean some problems and uncomfortable situations for you; since Android 4.4 Google restricted the SD card write access to only Google apps and the third party applications installed by the manufacturer, so not having a preset one or a google provided one, you won't be able to modify anything from the SD card without connecting the phone to a PC. This can be solved with root privileges, but if you understand what that means and the consequences it has, you'll understand that's a decision you need to make and prolly HTC won't like it if you need to claim your warranty.-MiscellaneousSomething I didn't like from this phone and I liked more from my previous one that it's not covered in everywhere else, is the notification LED. This one has only 3 colors: red when battery's low, green when it's fully charged, and an orange-like for everything else; maybe there's a setting to change this, or you could use an third party application for it, but so far I haven't found any setting.-ConclusionThe HTC One M8 is an excellent piece of engineering, nicely crafted with a good performance and optimization, which however has some flaws that can be improved, some by software, and some will need to be taken in consideration, hopefully, for the next generation's model, and if you're reading the conclusion after reading the review, we can conclude you're a very patient person :)Thanks for your time, hope this turns out to be helpful for you!", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Phone I have ever owned", "Author": "Kendall", "ReviewID": "R2ZNRU9FB21604", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently got an upgrade with Verizon, I hated my Iphone with a passion. So I switched over to an HTC, I have no regret! Everything about this phone is great! on top of that it looks professional.Battery Life:I recently had an iPhone, the battery life was absolutely horrid. I couldn't make it pasted one in the afternoon without needed a charge. But now I can make it through about a day, day and a half! HUGE improvement. It also has a Lithium battery which has a high charge density which means a longer life.Camera:Are you a phone-photographer? Well if you buy this phone you are sure to become one! the HTC One M8 has not one, but two rear cameras. HTC calls it a Duo camera. The main lens sports a 4 megapixel (1520\u2006\u00d7\u20062688) UltraPixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture and a pixel size of 2.0 micrometers. The secondary lens is there for just gathering information about depth. And instead on focusing on just the megapixel count and more on the size and quality of the pixels.BoomSound:I constantly listen to Sound Cloud, Pandora, and 8tracks. So when I heard that the HTC one M8 had built in amps I was ecstatic. Plus the M8 is 25 percent louder than before. The volume level easily beat the iPhone 5S, Galaxy S4 or Lumia 1020. The HTC One M8 has one massive .85cc top speaker chamber and .80cc bottom speaker chamber size. It's great for watching movies and YouTube.Size:Yes it is a Phablet (phone tablet) which means it has a bigger type of screen, Its about two times the size of my old iPhone 4s. I like it because its clear, handy, and the graphics are really nice. It is a 5inch screen along with a 441 ppi pixel density. The good thing about this phone is that its slightly big but not to big and its pixels are pretty amazing. Also includes a muilti touch sensitivity.Portability (size / weight):Has a good amount of weight to it that I really enjoy. It's kind of a larger phone but I really like it. Its not excessively heavy either. I haven't yet noticed a weight change since my trade in with my iPhone.  It's slim build and light weight make it easy to carry and use. Especially for the 5inch screen it has!Summary:All together I love the new HTC one M8, Its battery life is so much better, its camera fits my needs, and the BoomSound is amazing.

After being frustrated with the S3 I saw a commercial about the new HTC One M8 and figured I'd give it a go.The Pros:Man I can't tell you just the instant gratification upon feeling this device, it really does have a solid build quality to it, rather than holding an object that feels more like a toy (Glares at the S3). The system/OS is smooth as butter, if I could I would slap that on some toast and eat it I would, it's that damn good. The display is nice and bright, colors are more natural and feels more on point rather than the over saturated Samsung AMOLED displays. The sounds are bombastic, night and day compared to S3 due to Boomsound front facing speakers. The on screen capacitive buttons aren't a big deal for me, I actually like them.Cons-My only gripe is the camera quality, its not terrible, it's not great it's somewhere right in the middle and if you take a lot of night/low light shots it excels here-Not a major gripe here but it's noticeable, phone is a bit slippery and a bit heavier but the trade offs is totally okay in my book but for some users it may be an issue.I can't see myself going back to Samsung products after giving this a go, if you are on the fence you needn't fear, take the plunge cause I certainly don't regret it.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best phone I have owned in a long time!", "Author": "David Schendt", "ReviewID": "R1UR6D6JNBEHMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned quite a few phones (Note 3, Nexus4, Galaxy Nexus, and HTC Vivid, just to name a few).

I think it is terrible. Most of the photos are completely blown out and there is such a crazy difference between the HDR and regular auto mode that it is like two completely different cameras were used. Plus the image quality is just plain fuzzy and lacks detail of other comparable phones. It's a real head-scratcher that the HTC developers chose this route.  My Nexus 5 consistently delivers sharper, more true colors and better pictures across the board when I take the same picture using the same setting with both phones.  I guess if I wanted to tinker with all the settings on the M8 camera, I would rather plop the $649.00 down on a nice DSLR. In a market where the camera is  fast-becoming the deciding factor for consumers' choice of cell phones, this one is a really huge disappointment.And though the M8 is beautiful, the aluminum body has to be covered by a case to be used in everday life and that's a shame, because it ironically defeats the phone's stellar hardware design.  My Nexus 5 has not had a case since I bought it in February, and it has survived several drops with aplomb. Plus, I just love its sleek minialmist design, and slim, lightweight profile. After loving my M7 and switching to the N5 until the M8 came out, I personally think my phone does not have to be a big statement piece; rather it needs to be functional, simple, elegant, fast, sturdy, and have the ability to take a really nice photo quickly and without a lot of fuss.

When the time was nearing for the Sony Xperia Z2, Samsung S5, and HTC M8 spring release, I was in dilemma as far as which one would suit my needs. I decided to take a chance and buy this phone unlocked for both me and my girlfriend and we couldn't be any more happier with our decision because this phone is as every bit as good as any other leading mobile phone. I especially love how the audio speakers are placed in the front of the phone and the sound clarity is outstanding. Even now close to a month after owning this phone, the premium aluminum feel and look is pristine as when we first got it (but I highly recommend buying a case). Beyond any doubt, this phone has set the standard when the original 2013 version released only to raise the bar even further with this new model.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "One of the best phones of 2014", "Author": "mazen", "ReviewID": "R1PKY8S5KRQNS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best android phones of 2014, it is right up there with the iphone 5s, Samsung GS5 and the Sony Z2. The most noticeable thing about this phone is its superior build quality, gone are the days of plastic backs and flimsy design as this phone is all metal and exudes luxury. This phone is the iphone of the android ecosystem.The screen on this phone is one of the best that I have used to date, it has a 5' display with a crystal clear picture, true colors and not once have I come across an issue regarding screen brightness.The front facing HTC boom sound speakers are the best speakers put on a phone, EVER. The sound quality and loudness are astonishing, they easily beat the loudness of my ipad and at times drown out the sound of my TV set. In short, smartphone audio has never sounded better....or louder.The phones internals(CPU and Ram) are near identical to the other two industry leading smartphones on the market right now(GS5 and Z2). The phone is lightning quick and easily handles anything you throw its way, android OS has never been faster or more responsive.The Sense 6 user interface is one of the cleanest and most intuitive android skins to date and is only rivaled by stock android which is only available on nexus and google play edition devices. The Sense 6 UI easily puts to shame Samsung\u2019s TouchWiz UI and Sony\u2019s Xperia UI. This is how an android skin should be, true to its android roots with a few minor tweaks to capitalize on the hardware. The only minor complaint I have regarding the UI is the fact that you have to scroll up/down when you want to navigate the app tray as opposed to side to side.The phones battery stamina is what I expected it to be, it will get you through a whole day with light to moderate use and you will be charging this phone every night. The Sense UI does include two power saving modes(PSM), standard and extreme. The standard PSM throttles the phones processing power along with a few other of its internals in order to extend the phones battery life throughout the day and the phone works as usual. The extreme PSM is a little different, when activated its essentially turns your phone into a dumbphone getting rid of most of the phones capabilities and giving you access only to the phone and text messaging capabilities of the phone along with the ability to check your email inbox yourself(no auto updates); This mode will extend the battery life a significant amount(HTC promises 14 days of life on a single charge or 15 hrs from 5 % battery while on this mode). You can set extreme PSM to activate automatically when your phones battery hits a certain percentage and, just like that, gone are the days of \u201cHey, do you have a charger? My phones about to die.\u201d.Now, for the disappointing part of the phone, the camera. I am not saying that the camera on this phone is bad, but it\u2019s not great either. The phone is equipped with a 4 UltraPixel camera(Who are we kidding, it\u2019s a 4 megapixel camera with a fancy name, nice try marketing department) along with a second lens/depth sensor. I will focus on the main camera as I find the depth sensor lens to be quiet gimmicky and of no significant use. The camera takes decent photos that are more than good enough to take pictures that are meant for facebook and for day to day use. The images from a non-zoomed perspective look good, but when you zoom in, the photo suffers as the pixilation becomes evident. If you are looking for a camera to take photos which you will frame, look elsewhere. It really is a shame that the depth sensor  took precedence over upgrading the main lens(even an upgrade to 6 MP would have done the job) as that is the only thing keeping the phone from being called \u201cthe best phone of 2014, period\u201d. The front facing camera is a 5MP sensor (Yes, the front facing camera has more pixels than the main one) and works just as expected, good enough for  video chats and selfies.A few things worth mentioning, the phone does gets a little warm over prolonged use(this is standard will all the new snapdragon 801 processors), but it doesn't get uncomfortable, and that the phone is a little larger than other phones in its class as a result of the two boom sound speakers.In conclusion, This phone is a delight to use, a safe bet and is definitely \u201cone of the best phones of 2014\u201d.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best \"One\" I've ever had.", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R1ZHT6IEJTBKXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, so like most people, I've owned my fair share of smart phones. I've had flip phones and brick phones, an iPhone, and several Android devices, so I feel I have a fairly decent idea of what to expect when it comes to a good phone. The HTC One m8 completely blows my expectations out of the water.First Impressions:Right from the moment the T-mobile salesman hands me the box I can feel the weight of it, something I personally love. The first glimpse of the actual phone brought me back to being a little kid on Christmas morning. You can see it oozes quality craftsmanship with its clean lines, subtle curves, and brushed aluminum embodiment of pure awesomeness.  I pull it out of its box and remove the layers of plastic distraction to fully reveal the beauty within. As I said before, this phone is not a lightweight; at 160g you can feel the heft of its construction. I turn it on and the green \u201cHTC\u201d logo lights up the spacious 5\u201d display. I can immediately see how crisp and clean the picture is, courtesy of the 1920x1080 pixel piece of engineering. The stupid T-mobile jingle plays through the BoomSound speakers, and even that annoying bit of commercialism makes me smile because I\u2019ve never heard it clearer from a phone. All in all it\u2019s off to a great start.Hardware Specs/Build Quality:So as I\u2019ve now said twice, the phone is built solid. It has a brushed aluminum unibody made with \u201czero gap\u201d construction (as it sounds, there are no visible gaps on the outside of the phone between materials). I cannot express how much I love the feel of this phone, I really can\u2019t, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s humanly possible, but I\u2019ll try. T-mobile released the m8 the same day as the Galaxy S5, so I had an opportunity to handle both phones before making my purchase. The S5 might have a few more fancy features than the m8, but wow does it feel flimsy; just as flimsy as every other Galaxy product out there. I\u2019ve owned two Galaxy phones now, and while I liked them for their features and performance, both phones succumbed to their poor manufacturing quality (ie cracked button bezel that led to cracked screen, and then just a cracked screen). In contrast, my last HTC phone, the MyTouch 4G, is like three years old and still perfect. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s scratched to hell, but my Father-in-law, whom I sold it to, still uses it every day for a myriad of apps without complaint. Okay, enough about HTC\u2019s awesome build quality, you get it, they rock. The new internals of the m8 surely don't disappoint; it sports the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, a 2.3 GHz quad core processor accompanied by 2GB of ddr3 ram. It also has 32GB of internal memory, with yes, an expandable microSD slot for up to 128GB of storage space. I don't know the person who needs that much space on their phone, but whoever they are, I'm sure they're extra pleased about that. The speakers on this thing sound great. Personally I hated the gimmicky nature of \u201cBeats by Dre\u201d that were found on the m7 (though I admit they sounded great), so I wasn\u2019t unhappy to see the m8 lose them. The BoomSound speakers that now adorn the m8 sound awesome (for a phone, mind you); not to mention the awesomeness factor of them being placed on the front of the phone. The screen looks great; I really can\u2019t imagine a clearer picture, but then again, when your phone with a 5\u201d screen has the same resolution as your TV with a 60\u201d screen, it stands to reason the picture will be REALLY clear. The last thing I wanted to address was the ever so controversial \u201cbezel\u201d on the front of the phone. My honest opinion is that it does nothing to detract from the phone. Yes, the screen could be larger without it, or maybe the phone could be shorter, but come on, talk about nitpicking. The phone is awesome and I personally have no qualms with a half inch strip of glass proudly displaying \u201chtc\u201d on the front of my awesome HTC phone, but hey, what do I know?Cameras:I felt the cameras deserved their own section as they are a point of controversy of actual merit, unlike the bezel. The rear cameras (yes, I said cameras, as in plural) are a very interesting feature on this phone. The main camera is more or less the same as was featured on the m7, a 4-megapixel sensor. While 4-megapixels may seem small compared to most other high-end phones out there ( like the Sony Xperia Z1 and its 20.1 megapixel behemoth), there is a reason to the madness; the Ultrapixel. That\u2019s right; the sensor is almost twice the size of normal phone camera sensors, which allows it to take in over 300% more light. Why is that good? Well, considering many pictures people take these days are in low-light areas (ie restaurants, concerts, anywhere at night, etc), the Ultrapixel allows you to take much clearer pictures during those times you might not be in perfect light (ie most of the time). The second rear camera is a new feature, and a damn cool one at that. It captures distance information and then allows you to adjust the focus of the pictures. Oh, and did I mention you can adjust the focus AFTER you take the picture? Yeah, it\u2019s that cool. This also means you can take pictures much quicker than with other phones. It really is pretty nifty, and I must admit I have spent several hours just messing with the cameras and the different things you can do to the pictures (nerd alert). Finally, the front facing camera boasts a full 5 megapixels so you can take that perfect selfie. Not something I personally give a hoot about, but hey, it\u2019s there.Software/User Interface:Obviously the latest high-end phone is going to launch with the latest Android update. The Android 4.4.2 KitKat is very smooth and pretty, as expected. The extra features that HTC throws in are pretty cool too. One of my favorites is the \u201cPower Saver\u201d mode it has on the drag down menu. That combined with the 2600mA/h battery lets the phone last all day and then some with fairly heavy use. I must admit that I\u2019m not a fan of the \u201cBlinkFeed\u201d screen, and have yet to find a way to turn it off, but luckily it\u2019s only the left window of the home screen. All in all the UI is very snappy and responsive. Most phones these days can claim the same, but it\u2019s nice nevertheless. Another kind of nifty feature is that you can tap the screen twice to wake it up to the lock screen, or you can bypass the lock screen altogether by simply swiping up.Brass tacks:The phone is built to last, has the latest internals, has a truly awesome camera setup, and exudes \u201cpremium\u201d at every turn. I know I will be enjoying this phone for a good long while. As the self-proclaimed most indecisive person in the world, I have to say I\u2019m not feeling even an inkling of buyer\u2019s remorse.  It doesn\u2019t have every gadget and doodad in the Galaxy (pun intended), and it might not be the great conversationalist that SIRI is, but in my opinion, it\u2019s the best mainstream phone on the market, hands down.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is the perfect phone for the 2014.

After all, the M7 is still a fast phone, is beautiful, and is still a sexy phone.  Well, I got the chance to get a unit from HTC to review, test, demo, etc. and I can say whole-heartedly:  It IS worth the upgrade.Sound:  HTC switched from Beats Audio to their own Boomsound software to enhance sound.  It's hard to say if one is better than the other as they both have advantages in certain scenarios, but one thing is clear:  this phone is MUCH louder than the M7 and still sounds great!  I cannot impress upon you how much everyone is impressed when I share a video with friends around the table.  The headphone jack on this one gets a touch louder than the previous version as well.The display is beautiful.  I have to say that it's really hard to tell a difference from the already great M7 display except for two things:  1.  It's bigger.  2. the auto-brightness works better (the M7 wanted to go a touch brighter than I wanted it and was slower to adjust than the M8.  The M8 is faster to adjust, stays at a better level indoors and gets to the super-bright I need in direct sunlight.Design:  When the photos of this phone came out, I didn't think it looked as nice as the previous version.  Once I saw the new one in person, I have to say that pictures do not do it justice.  It looks better than the previous one.  The tolerances and seams are so much tighter than last year's (which was awesome to begin with and put competitors to shame).  The finish looks really expensive and, contrary to many comments, is not slippery at all (feels noticeably less slippery than a phone from a larger competitor that my employer issued to me).  The glass layer over the speakers grills is a really nice touch.Camera:  The camera is really great.  It gets better white balance than the previous version and is super fast.  I can get great pictures of food in a dim bar and it gets the colors right on top of that without noise or grain! Example in a dark restaurant:[...]I'm very fond of the UFocus feature which lends a really nice bokeh effect thanks to the second \"depth of field\" camera on the back.  Amazingly, the selfie-cam is 5MP which really takes awesome shots worth keeping!  Seriously...have you ever seen a front facing shot that was worthing keeping or in which you didn't kick yourself for using the front camera?!  People complain of lack of detail...look at this picture and notice the subtle veins on the flower! [...]I've used this phone side by side with a larger competitors phone and this one is noticeably faster.  Really...go into a store and try it.  You'll be amazed and won't be able to go back.Something I really, really love with this phone:  with either the Dot View case or the standard flip cover case (I've used both extensively), the phone sleeps or unlocks with an open or close of the case without having to swipe to unlock.  I really like this touch!Finally...Blinkfeed:  I really, really love this!  If you've ever used Flipboard, Google Currents, or other news aggregators, you'll wonder how they got it so wrong once you try Blinkfeed for a week.  It has everything I want in a pretty format (like Flipboard) but way, way faster.Do yourself a favor and get this phone.

The sound quality is similar to the HTC One M7, and so that means it is fantastic. I am a YouTube junkie, and usually am watching videos while outside. So being able to hear them without having to carry my headphones around is a big plus. I love the Duo camera features. UFocus has become one of my norms now when taking pics.

After upgrading from an HTC One (M7) to an HTC One M8 on 5 April 14, both myself and my girlfriend is still amazed with the improvement HTC brought to the M8, and I must share it with you:1. Duo Camera - While people are skeptical and some reviews are constantly claiming the low megapixel count will means low quality pictures. This is not true, the optic performance of the ultra-pixel camera along with the supporting lens is superb. The added depth information allow the pictures to have better color reproduction, the ability to refocus the shots after taking is just something that was only available in DSLR previously.2. Amazing Battery Life - The average battery life of my HTC One M7 was 18-20 hrs with about 3 hrs of screen on time, which is pretty amazing, my daily data usage is about 150-200MB on 4G network all time. With the same usage pattern I now get an average of 24hrs with 5-6hrs of screen on time. Some friends are getting two full days of usage isn't that amazing?3. The new BlinkFeed - Okay blinkfeed was available in the HTC One M7, but HTC have redesign it and it is now become better. A lot of people are thinking BlinkFeed is flipboard, my answer is that is totally wrong, blinkfeed work very differently, it is more intelligent and more seemless in usage. Basically once you have set up the information source that you are interested in, blinkfeed will create a profile and make the information available in a screen and it get updated as per the schedule.There are many more great features that I am still exploring after 2 month of using it.

What you may not realize is that the M8 has a high-quality headphone amplifier that should make it hard to ignore for any audiophile. With a nice pair of earphones I compared the audio output from this device to the Galaxy S5 and my own Galaxy S3. The difference was enormous. While the overall presentation emphasizes warmth over clarity too much for my taste, sounds from this device are amazingly clean and rich for a phone. The Samsung devices sound very bad by comparison. Look up the GSM Arena review of the M8 and you'll see that instrumented testing backs my opinion up. If you care about audio and you hear the difference, you won't be able to pass this up. It's in a class of its own in this regard.I must comment on the BoomSound speakers. Like you I knew all about them before my purchase. But what I didn't appreciate was how much they would enhance my lifestyle, which involves listening to podcasts and audiobooks throughout the day. I like to be constantly stimulated and learning. With the M8 I can have rich and full playback of anything I like wherever I go without carrying around a separate Bluetooth speaker that must be paired and charged. That is a huge convenience and pleasure. These speakers are so impressive.I realize the camera is subpar for this class of phone but it is more than adequate. I have always used a dedicated camera for any photos that are truly important anyway so this isn't a big problem even if it costs the phone some bragging rights.

Aluminum body frame is great. It is indeed strange that front camera has more pixels than back camera. This may be a sign that selfies are becoming popular. There are two cameras in the back one is taking the depth information and you can do post processing changing focus in  camera. Features are : Back-illuminated sensor (BSI), Autofocus, Manual focus, Digital image stabilization, Face detection, Smile detection, Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Burst mode, Geo tagging, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Macro mode. Battery life was excellent. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer.

I was upgrading from an iPhone 4s. I am a heavy business phone used, with a total of about 50 phone calls a day, plus emails and texts.  No games and limited videos. The 4s is superb phone for these purposes, and allows me to accomplish what matters quickly and easily: making money.Recently, I had decided I should get a larger screen, as the 3.5 inch on the 4s is somewhat small when I have to read pdf documents that are emailed to me.  After researching a new phone, the HTC seemed like a great one.  I use google apps heavily, and thought using an Android phone made sense for compatibility purposes.  The larger screen would allow me to better read, edit and process pdf docs for clients and colleagues.  However, it soon became apparent that manipulating the larger phone with one hand (while driving, typing or any other task) is much more difficult.  You press the wrong buttons often. Additionally, often you have to press the same spot on the phone several times to get action.  A task I use heavily, copying the number on a received call in order to paste it in an email to my staff to respond to, is not able to be accomplished with one click and hold.The ergonomics of the phone are poor.  It is not comfortable to have up to your ear for long periods of time.  Additionally, you can often put the phone to your ear and get poor volume, because you are not on the speaker properly.  I never had this problem with my iphone.  To be fair, I never put a case on the phone (it did not arrive before I returned the phone after 5 days of use.) A case may have made it more comfortable and easy to manipulate.  The absolute deal breaker for me was when I was listening to a voice mail, and I received a call.  After pressing the answer button several times, the call was picked up, but my voicemail continued playing! That's right.  I had a potential client talking while I was hearing my voice mail as well.  Simply an unacceptable bug.  In the end, I went back to my iphone 4s, and will wait for a different model to come out.

Great job, HTC at beating the \"Big-boys\" to the market place with an exceptional phone. \"Bravo\". However, the most intriguing aspect of the entire launch was the \"Dot View\" case, and HTC knew it going in, and they dropped the ball. The \"dot View\" cases were not available in any kind of numbers, nor does HTC know when they would become available. it's been nearly a month since launch and no cases. I mean, NONE. After-market suppliers have none and big phone carriers such-as, Verizon [who had exclusivity at launch] Best buy and AT&T;, all, have no cases. You may find one on eBay, if your willing to take your chances on \"might haves\" or \"may ship\". Without the \"Dot View\" case the HTC One M8 is just another phone [albeit] a very good one. Had I known the cases would be a problem, I would have waited. With hindsight and a clearer picture, now I see it was better to wait, just to see if HTC would come through with the cases to make the phone the sensation its been to this point.
