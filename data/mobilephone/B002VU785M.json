When it comes to mobile phones Nokia always strikes me as being one of the most durable at a reasonable price, hence the reason my attention went straight for the Nokia phone because any mobile phone owned by my husband really needs to stand the test of durability as he doesn't take much care in protecting it.  This phone actually looks nicer in real than online. It's unlocked, and I'm outside the US, and it was quite easy, I just slip in the sim and it worked perfectly with the local network. I haven't checked out thoroughly the quality of pics as yet, but my only disappointment so far is that I didn't get a USB cable with it.
