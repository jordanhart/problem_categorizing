This is an excellent phone 4 the price. It's main strengh, music. Speakers are as loud as hell and excellent quality, earphones even better. It may take a while to get used 2 the music buttons but not a problem. For a 2mp camera photos are pretty good, but no flash though, but I can live with that. Video is choppy though, but this is an XpressMusic, it's not its purpose. Battery life is incredible, both for music and talking, design is slim enough and color has that cool metallic look, only wished dealer had red or black as well. If you want a great non-Android/iPhone cell, this is the choice.Only drawback, it's imported from Africa, so you need an american charger, but u can get 1 in amazon for less than 3 bucks (Nokia AC-3U Travel Charger).", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "really great!!!", "Author": "aryana", "ReviewID": "R1J7ZG036YXF5F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product and accessories! It is unlocked as labeled and Im using this as my roaming phone.
