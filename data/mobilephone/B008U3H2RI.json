{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Impressive!", "Author": "Sasha", "ReviewID": "RXUSBPFM124VI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Android phone is smaller than any other smart phone I have seen, making it easy to fit in pockets and other small places.APPLICATIONSThe first and most prevalent was how it uses applications. THIS PHONE WILL NOT RUN most higher quality applications, i.e. Bejeweled, The Plague, etc. It simply doesn't have enough RAM or whatever to run those apps smoothly or run them at all. However, I have had no problem playing simple games, like Word Search, Mind Games, Sudoku, Unblock, etc.I have noticed that the more applications you have installed, the slower the phone will operate in general. This begins to happen fairly quick, and I have already limited myself to about 6 installed applications. For some people, this may be a problem.TEXTING/CALLINGThis phone comes with a stylus in case you have sausage fingers (like me) and can't hit only one letter at a time, making texting much easier. The butt of the stylus almost immediately started to come out, but this can be easily remedied with a little super glue or other appoxy. Diverse range of texting characters, symbols, smileys, and what-not are available. I haven't had any issues texting so far. Occasionally this phone will not end a call after pressing 'End Call' (maybe it's just my phone) and the touch screen is not nearly as sensitive as other smart phones I have used. You will need to press a little more, as opposed to just brushing your finger on the screen.PHOTO GALLERY/MUSIC PLAYERThe photo gallery (to view/edit photos you add to your phone) has always run slowly. The more pictures you have, the longer it will take to load, and this happens rather quickly as well. The music player is great and runs smoothly, however sound quality from this phone is very low and is audibly distinguishable even with head phones plugged in.SETTINGS/CUSTOMIZATIONDesktop configuration is excellent, and I can easily drag and drop any application or widget, and you can change your wallpaper to any picture you like on the phone. You can flip between five different \"screens\" allowing a more in depth organization of all your tools (I like being able to have one screen blank to see my wallpaper!) One setting I have had much difficulty with is setting the ringtone. It could be an issue specific to my phone, but this phone does not want to save my ringtone that I set for a very long time (the default is kind of.... horrible) However, the option to choose any music on the phone as a ringtone is available and usually preferred. It does come with an alarm clock for those of you with a schedule, and also a calendar to set dates and times (it could have been made easier to use, but you get used to it fairly quick) Privacy options are great, I love the pattern lock upon waking the phone from sleep.THIS UNNECTO PHONE DOES NOT have any physically protective cases made for it! Because it is much smaller than other smart phones, and bigger than most flip phones, you will most likely be unable to find a protective case for this phone. This is a big issue, especially if your hands like to drop phones. If you drop this phone, it could very likely break. Some corner stores/convenience stores may have a little protective pouch for a dollar that holds this phone nicely (be prepared for a longer journey around your local shops to find what fits right!)CONCLUSIONI have had this phone for a decent amount of time now, and it has been serving me great with very little technical issues or glitches. At the time I bought this phone, it costed me 140$. I was stretching out on a limb, buying a brand name phone I knew nothing about, but I am thoroughly impressed and pleased. Of course, it was not quite what I expected, but for that price, it definitely serves its purpose very well. I would highly suggest this phone as the best cheap alternative.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$139.99", "Features": "Android 2.2 Froyo\nUnlocked GSM Quad-band Mobile Phone\nDual SIM, Dual Standby, Single Talk\nGSM SIM1 850/900/1800/1900, GSM SIM2 850/900/1800/1900\nCamera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi", "Name": "Unnecto U-660-2NA Drone Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Mobile Phone - US Warranty - White", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MRXBvLe%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008U3H2RI"}}
