It's very simple to use once you get the hang of it. Its beautifully crafted in my opinion and just an easy use. My phone came in very good quality given the fact that it was used and I am enjoying greatly. Only downside is that phone memory is taken up by unnecessary dated apps which are not deletable unless you rout it and i needed to by a small SD chip to add my songs, videos, pics, etc. Overall it truly is a bank for your buck and if you want a phone that you don't have to be embarrassed about putting in public it would be this one right here.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone touchscreen with keyboard", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R1DHQ2NHJVMA6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HTC States is a very good phone has all the great features of a touch screen along with a button keyboard..... takes great pictures and nice videos as well as the Facebook key.... nice feature..... similar style to a Blackberry phone I was very happy with all the functionality although the screen was a little small it fit in My hand great and was easier to use than the full touchscreen....", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "rnakala", "ReviewID": "R2UOST4YE7SGPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had bought a motorola flip out phone for my 10 year old daughter but when we got this one we just loved it.
