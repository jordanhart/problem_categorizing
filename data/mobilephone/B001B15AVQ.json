Most of the time, I have no problems with coverage in my area, although I do get dropped calls every now and then.Customer Service----------------Net10 could definitely use some work on their customer service. I had to call customer service on at least a couple of occasions for (1) minutes failing to appear on my phone after I've purchased airtime and (2) problem transferring my phone number from an old phone to a new phone. It took about half an hour for them to credit me for my minutes and almost an hour to get my number transferred to my new phone. Part of the problem is _communication_ with the operators. It was a little frustrating getting them to *listen* and *understand* the issues I was trying to explain to them. But I will say that at the very least their operators are courteous.If you can get past their customer service - well - Net10 offers very competitive rates. Hopefully you won't have to deal with their tech support, ever. Many of the support you need is automated on the Web. Things like transferring your old number to a new phone can now be done yourself through their Website.Conclusion----------The Net 10 service offers the best prepaid rates bar none.

I am not a heavy phone user.  I had a monthly plan for a few years and never came close to using all of my minutes so why pay for them.  Net10 is the perfect solution.  I get by with $30 every other month.About the phone itself, it is OK.  I love the size, it is thin and easy to carry in hand or pocket.  Keypad is easy to use.  Features are basic and easy to use.  It is a phone to make calls, not a gps, computer, or camera.  My only complaint is the sound.  People on the other end do not seem to have trouble hearing me, but from my end they sound a little quiet and as if they are in a tunnel.  Feel like I am always saying \"what?\"  It does not seem to be the reception of the call, but the lack of clarity in the earpiece.But, since I only talk on the phone 30min/wk at the most, I'm willing to put up with it for now.  Also, I bought this phone on sale for $19.99 with 300 minutes, so basically I made $10 in the deal.

I've had to call them on a few occasions. Their tech support, which is outsourced, is slow and getting through can sometimes feel like pulling teeth. For example, on one occasion, it took me 50 minutes on the phone with them to transfer my number from this LG300G phone to a new one.The worse was yet to come. On another occasion, I was told matter-of-factly that it would take up to 72 hours to get my number transferred. \"72 hours?!\" I cried. The response I received was a nonchalant \"72 hours. It takes up to 72 hours to transfer you number. Don't call before 72 hours.\" I was incensed. After 48 hours, I called them again, and this time another operator (who sounded slightly more intelligent) managed to get my number transferred within a couple of minutes. The moral of the story: Net 10 is a descent service to go with provided you don't have to make too many tech support calls (I haven't had to call them for anything other than transferring my phone number to a new phone). You have been forewarned.Conclusion----------The Net 10 service offers the cheapest prepaid cell phone service.

I'm using it as an \"in between\" phone until I decide to sign another contract with someone else. For a pre-paid phone, I'm quite happy. The phone itself has all the basic functions I need and isn't complicated to use. It's compact and light-weight. I can easily fit it in the pocket of my jeans when I don't want to carry a bag--and it has a key lock feature to keep it from dialing while in my pocket.I've had two problems with this phone/service. When I originally activated it, I called my house phone to test it out. The caller ID showed a woman's name who I had never heard of. However, I contacted the customer service and the issue was cleared up within 24 hours. The other problem I've had is with volume control. It took me 15 minutes to find how to set my phone to vibrate instead of ring at the movie theater. Once I figured it out, though, it was no problem. It just isn't listed in the settings as you might expect. It's under ringer volume, instead of a separate setting for vibrate.All in all, no big issues. The phone feels almost like a children's toy in terms of weight, but it's durable. Battery life seems great. It lasts for two or three days, even with me using the phone. Net10's rates for minutes are great, IMHO. I haven't found another company that offers as many minutes for the price that they do. And you get 300 minutes with the phone. You're totally set for 60 days from the second you buy the phone. You have to spend a minimum of $20 every 60 to keep the service. This is nothing compared to your average contract deal. There's even an on-screen display that tells you exactly how many minutes you have left, and how many days of service are left until you need a new card. If you need all the fancy features of a smart phone, this isn't the one for you, but if you're looking for an \"in between\" phone like I was, or a simple phone for routine tasks, I would recommend this one.

It retails for $30, but since 300 minutes are part of the package (and Net10 calls cost 10 cents/minute), the phone is basically $0.  I'd say that makes it priced where it belongs.I'm actually the kind of guy who's drawn to feature-free stripper phones like this, but I still think it's mediocre, mostly because it can't even do the basics right.  The keys are too small, recessed, and squashed together for anyone over 13, making dialing-by-fingernail the only way that works.  The ringtones are weak, made even more inaudible thanks to the speaker's placement on the back of the phone (most people rest their phones on a surface face-up, yes?).  Worse, LG couldn't be bothered to put a volume rocker on the side, depriving you of making those quick on-the-fly adjustments you sometimes need.  I'm not a big fan of the menus either, and what's with the calculator not accepting more than two digits after the decimal?Regardless of your feeling about Net10 itself, there's really no point in putting up with this crap phone when you can so easily step up to a better model.

Henry \"atlantagreg\"", "ReviewID": "R2FZG0S3RRAD09", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Most reviews of this phone are grounded, but a few seem to have higher expectations than maybe they should have for this type of device.  You're not talking about a $250 Verizon model or an iPhone here, folks.  It's a $29.95 (retail), plastic, BASIC, no-thrills, cell phone.  Frankly, it's amazing that for that price you can get something with a color LCD screen that actually gets cell receptions at all.  So my 4-star rating is based on the features and quality of this phone FOR THE PRICE.I use Verizion as my main cell provider, but sometimes I like to sell things on Craig's List or Ebay and want to have a way for people to contact me if they have questions about something I'm selling.  I do not however, want to give them my main cell number.  So I got this Net10 phone for that specific purpose - as a more anonymous way of communicating with strangers who I don't know, who call to ask about products.  For that, it's great.While plastic, overall the phone is pretty sturdy except perhaps for the upper battery door area with is somewhat \"creeky\" when you hold the camera and press in (it gives, slightly).  The buttons are small and yes, you can accidentally press two at one if you have sausage fingers, but a small amount of paying attention will solve this - it's not designed to be a hard-core \"texting\" phone, and for that, you should buy a phone with a full keyboard.  They do glow a pleasant Blue color when in use, by the way - another minor but amazing feature at this price. The LCD screen though lower resolution, works fine enough for what it is.  The reception is excellent, actually being better than my LG Dare when indoors.  The ear speaker is just a bit fuzzy, making folks sound like they're talking through a cloth - but still not super bad.  People I talk to say the microphone is great, and they can hear me clearly.  No camera, no 3D video games, no multi-phase transporter... sorry.... not for $29.95!My only real complaint?  You use your minutes when you check voice mail.  Maybe I'm being cheap, but I figure if you're just calling in to check messages, they should charge a flat 5-cent or 10-cent rate for the entire call, and not a \"per minute\" charge for it.  So if you tend to ignore calls and let a lot of them to go voice mail, keep this in mind as just checking your messages frequently WILL use your minutes.Ok, now, I do have to say that I would NOT use this or any cheap prepaid phone as a full time cell phone.  I'm one of those people who feel that cheap plastic and cell signals do equal radioactivity in your brain.  So I prefer to get something built substantially better if I'm going to talk for hours a month on it.  Likewise, if I had teens, I probably wouldn't want to fry their brains ahead of time by letting them use a device such as this as much as they do.  But for occasional use, and for people who don't LIVE on their cell phones (yes, those people still exist), I think this represents a great value for the price.", "Date": "May 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good enough.", "Author": "Michael F.

With NET10 service and phones it is no different.The phone:This is the most basic phone I have ever bought. Not having an MP3 player or the internet really left me wanting a new phone after having upscale phones in the past. Now, as long as you don't need all the cool bells and whistles, this is a fine, basic phone. It's tough, it's small, and the reception on mine wasn't the best but it was better than other providers I have tried.Menu: It is a mild pain to navigate but as stated, it's a basic, no frills phone. No touchscreen and not many shortcut buttons.Although the button are recessed, I have had more than one occaision where buttons are pressed in my pocket.-Service:GOOD - When I needed to transfer my old NET10 number from a different phone to this phone, it was easy to do.BAD - When my minutes expired by 1 day, I contacted customer service and was NOT happy to find out that not only was my number no longer available, I had to be reasigned a new one and they deleted my entire account. I had to enter everything/register from scratch. Very poor service in that aspect. Do NOT let your minutes expire.-Minutes: They stack as you enter more minutes at the end of the period. I rarely ever use my phone so I have thousands of minutes I will never use but it is better to have them, than to NOT have them when you need them.I've been to different stores that had different options to add your minutes and I wasn't crazy about that. One has the cards that provide you a serial number while the store next door has a paper advertisement (that isn't the same deal) that the cashier has to provide you the serial number on the receipt. If you buy time in advance, you have to save that receipt somewhere until you need to renew you minutes. A card is easier to save. Receipts can get damaged, fade, smudge, etc. You can purchase new minutes right through the phone as well if you prefer.-There are good and bad points but for a basic, no frills phone, it's not bad for the price you pay.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "good price", "Author": "mzeina", "ReviewID": "RFK1VIUNQ7BM4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "for the price i payed it's a good purchase. phone itself is confusing and hard to navigate and net 10 coverage is not very good, i'm having trouble to hear my party all the time. good secondary phone or for the user who doesn't depend on it.", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "worth it", "Author": "M.

Net 10's reps (via email) keep saying \"it should take 24 to 48 hours\" (which I'm beyond) while almost everyone I've spoken to, including people who sell these phones, says it should take hours at most.  Earlier today I spoke by phone to a rep who apologized and promised it would be done within \"2 to 4 hours.\"  When that didn't happen I called back and a different rep rudely kept insisting that it takes \"7 to 10 days\" but then ended up telling me to it should be done \"tomorrow\"!It better be, or this phone is going back and I'm going with someone else.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Does NOT include 300 minutes!", "Author": "Ray B.", "ReviewID": "R275HHVL6FYW7A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace another NET10 phone; an old one that I was having problems with.

If the inventers of the English language had ever dealt with Net10 customer service, they would have invented a word much stronger than the word \"worst\". Net10 gives a new meaning to words such as \"worst\", \"hate\", \"incompetence\", \"crooks\", among others. Even the simple action of transferring your Net10 number from  a Net10 phone to another Net10 phone becomes so frustrating that at the end of days and countless but fruitless calls, and hours of waiting on hold, you feel like smashing your phone with a hammer and then driving your semi-truck over it back and forth several times and then throwing its pieces into a volcano and sending a nuclear missile with warhead to that volcano.

Well, there was no antenna to break off, but also rotten reception to go with it. Move your thumb over the wrong spot and the call gets dropped. Terrible!!! Then after only about three months, the screen went totally out with more than 400 minutes left and all of my contacts. The phone still works because I called it from my home phone. So after agonizing over what to do, I logged into Net 10's website as a registered user. This was no help at all. An e-mail address was provided, so I wrote a long e-mail to them to ask what my options were. In transferring my old number and minutes from the old phone, both new and old phones need to be left on while one enters numbers into their web page. For this to happen, one needs to read a code from the old phone. In the case of a broken screen, this is impossible. Well, the e-mail came back as \"undeliverable\". That was the last straw!!!
