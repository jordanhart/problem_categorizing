The price here seemed reasonable for a last-gen phone, and although I assumed I wouldn't be getting a retail-packaged device, I did kinda expect a brand new OEM-packaged US unit. What I actually got was a Canadian-branded (Koodoo) pay-as-you-go package that had quite clearly been returned (the blister pack had been re-taped where it was sliced and the inner plastic was crumpled and dirty). The phone itself was clean enough and everything works fine. I've hooked it up to StraightTalk and it's actually a great phone - much faster than my HD7 and some great new features in WP8.I just thought folks should be aware that you may not get a brand new device, even though I didn't see anything on the product page to indicate it was used.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone is NOT sold unlocked!", "Author": "FFC Cooke \"Mokowheke\"", "ReviewID": "RPCSYQ6K26RPU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only complaint I have regarding this product is that it is NOT unlocked when you receive it....OK, the seller DID send mean e-mail telling me how to unlock it when I received it, but that is NOT the point...It is clearly marketed as being \"unlocked\" and that is simply untrue...So why not be honest say that it is \"un-lockable\"?", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "euro version RM-914", "Author": "K", "ReviewID": "R3K1GGLSAU8N02", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like Windows Phone, but since this is the Euro version I can not use it to it's full 3G speeds (900/2100).

It would be nice to have a flash with the camera. Just remember to check with your provider as to make sure you get the right version.

Nothing special about the phone, but it works and the tiles make it very easy to get accustomed to using it.  I have bought it for international use which I will try starting next week.  The phone was unlocked, but for some reason MetroPCS could not activate it (MetroPCS was purchased by T-Mobile and now uses their GSM network).  Seller confirmed it was unlocked and suggested I tried t-mobile directly.  I went to T-Mobile store and it was activated on their network within 10 minutes.  Please note the phone I received was AT&T; branded (meaning it had AT&T; software and symbol during start-up).  By activating it on T-mobile I confirmed it was unlocked and ready to accept international SIM cards.  As far as the phone it is a basic smartphone, it shows some lag when  using keyboard to input text into the store textbox and apps take a moment to load.  At this price I wasn't expecting a top end smart phone and this did not disappoint.  It will do fine for my usage which is to use only when I travel internationally.

Here are the things I like:PROS:1. It's fast and fluid. It just works.2. It's cheap! Can't beat the price3. The screen is nice and the feel of the phone is great.4. It has an offline GPS mode (but there is a slight problem with this...see CONS section)CONS:1. The GPS is only free for local use. If you try using the offline free GPS in another country it will ask you to pay for a licensing fee. That's what happened to me when crossing back and forth from Canada and the USA.2. There is no led light or camera flash on this device. Makes it useless to shoot pictures with at night.3. The keyboard is CRAP! It is seriously terrible... I find that many users like myself end up hitting the comma button repeatedly instead of the space bar. I swear I'm pressing the space bar, but the comma always registers. Also the accuracy of the keyboard is terrible. It makes for an unpleasant experience at times..... I'm not the only one with this issue, as several of my friends have the same problem.Conclusion:Overall, although there are many shortcomings with this phone, it is still good considering the price. I don't think you'd be disappointed with it considering what you get for for the price.
