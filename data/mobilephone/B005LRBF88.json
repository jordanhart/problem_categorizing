The only reason they have ever failed me was my own fault due to loss or water damage.The main thing that impressed me about the V3xx is the fact that it seems to be able to pick up weak signals better than other phones. Before this type of phone came out I was restricted to the old \"Boat Anchor\" type phone because of it's ability to pick up a weak signal at long range. I miss my old boat anchor phone but i don't miss it's size.Once I got the V3xx I was able to even use it inside my home with ease. I've almost always had good clarity unless I was talking to someone with a bad phone who did not speak properly into it.Another thing I like about these phones is the water damage indicator which is a red dot in the battery compartment. When water comes into contact with the phone the dot changes color from red to white and once it turns it will not go back to red regardless of how well you dry the phone. I like this feature because some sellers will claim a phone has no water damage. I always pop the battery lid and check the dot. If you see no dot it means the seller removed it to conceal that it is water damaged.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Surprises", "Author": "Michelle L.
