I got this through barter. hoping to use it as a prepaid. but it is contract only. that is okay. so, the wi-fi connects fine. the downloads happens in seconds. the camera is switchable from front to back. There are more, useful apps. the internet moves fast. My only issues with droid are: you need an sd card to take pictures/record videos and you cannot move Google apps to sd card. There is only one gb of available space. but i am loving this phone.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "ehhhh", "Author": "Johnny", "ReviewID": "RSEDD0L4NLGWO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'd rather give it like a 2 and a half. Because you get what ya pay for, very nice, snappy out the box, but like everyone else says, battery is atrociously short on terms of life. I fully charge it and on standby, wifi off, GPS off, mobile data off, it'd last about 15-18 hours I'd say. But as soon as you turn on that beautiful screen and use it, say bye bye. I have a special speed charger and being on Skype drains the battery faster than it can sharge lol. But if ya just want a phone that'll work when you need it and don't care about YouTube and stuff. For the 50-60 bucks you can get these for I'd scoop one up. But, if you are a diehard android user (apps etc) stay as far away as you can!!!", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is ok!", "Author": "MTatum", "ReviewID": "R2LLCNTDAIISU4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because my other Droid phone would not work (that was my second phone).  The phone was working well until a couple of weeks ago.  Now when I make a call, the person on the other line has to hang up because my screen goes blank and won't turn on after a call.  It is alright when you reach a person, but if you reach voice mail you have to turn the phone completely off to hang up.  I will never buy a Droid phone again.  I have had three in the last 18 months.  The old phone will be great for target practice.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "chris conner", "ReviewID": "RVF4B8Y8167NG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was in great shape for a used phone.

When I called, he answered immediately and took the time to address my questions.  I ordered the phone shortly after our conversation and received it 2 days later. It was as described - no scratches on the screen.The phone was a 4G replacement for my girlfriend's 3G phone.  We had heard that Verizon was going to charge for data usage after June 28th when switching from a 3G phone to a 4G phone, so we wanted to keep our \"unlimited\" data plan intact and didn't want to pay Verizon full price for a 4G phone.We purchased a SIM card and then activated her phone.  The next day my girlfriend noticed that calls were being dropped when she used the speaker phone.  I called and emailed Jason regarding this.  He immediately overnited a replacement phone and also a prepaid return envelope for the first phone.  Great service.The replacement phone arrived the next day and works fine.I would do business with Jason again and would highly recommend him to anyone. He is definitely customer oriented, professional, accessible and stands by his product.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "i love my droid", "Author": "Robin Weathers", "ReviewID": "RTACO357HQ0Z0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i payed under $50 and can down my favorite games and get on the internet.  the camera is amazing and my pictures are great.  if i upgrade i will be ordering from amazon.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$124.99", "Features": "An Impressive 4.3\" Super AMOLED Plus Display Running On Verizon's Super-fast 4G LTE Network\nDual Cameras - 8MP Rear-facing Camera and a 1.3MP Front-facing Camera For Video Chat\nNetwork Compatibility-LTE 700, CDMA 800/1900\nMobile Hotspot-Yes, Mobile Hotspot-capable Supporting Up To 5 Device On 3G and Up To 10 Devices On 4G\nIntegrated GPS For Google Maps Navigation, Geo-tagging Photos, and More", "Name": "Samsung Droid Charge I510 Verizon CDMA 4G LTE Android Cell Phone - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417TKvChR%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005Q3ML3U"}}
