I recently upgraded my phone to this model and transferring my telephone number from my older phone was very easily (again I did it on the website).

Bluetooth, compact and affordable.I can hear everyone very clear on this phone, better than the old one. However, the outgoing signal got me so many complaints.  It's not static, but a wavy, reverberation sound that others hear.  I call customer service and they sent out a replacement... same model but reconditioned.  I still have the same problem. So, I wanted to switch it all back to 600g #1 and the web site told me I needed a new SIM card. THe girl I talked to understood and sent it out. I tried to do the transfer from the reconditioned to the 600g #2 online and something went wrong. Now my phones are rendered inactive and the person I got on to talk to had a language and understanding barrier with me. I have yet to resolve and return to cell phone sanity. I am disappointed after years of satisfaction.But in doing research, I found that my LG600g is a GSM and my old Motorola was a CDMA. The GSMs work on TMobile or AT&T; SIMs. (If your SIM card number starts 890141 and a bunch of other numbers, you have AT&T; sevice.  An interesting point is that the Tracfone models with c in the model code are CDMA and work on Verizon. These signals are better in rural areas, like mine. I heard a little rumor that Tracfone may come out with an LG 231c phone that is loaded with cool stuff.  I will endure the flaws of this 600g until that one comes out.

I have purchased this phone for both my wife and I and ported our old numbers and minutes over (no problems there, but make sure the tech you talk to knows how many minutes you currently have). This phone is pretty slick. The sound is great, the screen is nice and big, bluetooth integration is great (I've paired it with my car's integrated system, my laptop, and another LG600g), and the features are surprisingly robust.

(instead of having to navigate through a really long menu). if you're in a call, it will adjust the call volume. its very convenient.external display - if you just want to check the time without opening the phone, you can just press a button on the side, and you can see the date, time, signal strength and battery level on the outside screen.the things that annoy me:when you go to your inbox, the sender isn't in the title of text messages - it only shows the date and first few words of the message. really stupid, imo. also, when you get a new text, you can't tell who it's from until you open it.camera is really low qualityother things:the internet access is crippled, so don't expect to check your email from this phone or anything.bluetooth, however, isn't crippled, and was very easy to setup and use (at least with a mac). its especially useful if you plan to take pictures or use the voice recorder, because it doesn't cost any minutes to transfer them to your computer using bluetooth. you can also transfer ringtones this way.battery life seems pretty good, i haven't tested it but it goes down to 2/3 charge after about 2 days, so it could probably last a week on one charge.stuff about tracfone in general:activate your phone over the internet, its much easier than calling them. none of their representatives speak english very well, and the internet activation process is much easier anyway.USE BONUS CODES!! search on the internet for them. i added a 400 min, 365 service days card and got 350 bonus minutes. so with double minutes for life, that comes out to 2 * 400 + 350 = 1150 minutes for 99 dollars = 8.6 cents per minute. which = a good deal.if you're choosing between this and the motorola w376g -(this is all stuff i've read from other reviews on the internet. It is from reputable sources, but i don't actually own the motorola w376g. try googling \"pbushx2's weblog\" for lots of in-depth phone reviews)in terms of texting:t9 (this phone) > iTAP (motorola). i've heard on the motorola you have to press ok to auto-complete a word, whereas with the lg you just press 0 (space), which is much less awkward. also, i've read that the input is kind of slow/lags on the motorola.call quality:other reviews have said that the sound quality is poor on this phone (especially compared to the motorola), and you people sound like they are far away, or talking through a tunnel. I don't notice this at all, it sounds fine to me. its never dropped a call, and i've always gotten reception. (though i live in LA, so i'm not sure how the reception is out in rural areas)bluetooth and internet:bluetooth is crippled on the motorola, so if you want to transfer pictures, you have to send them to your email, which costs minutes.a lot of people complain about hitting the web browser button by accident with the motorola, and then getting minutes deducted.the button isn't as inconveniently placed on this phone. i've never once hit it by accident.other stuff:i'm pretty sure the motorola has a scroll wheel, which would make navigating the menus much easier, but i'm not certain.the external display on the motorola doesn't show the date and timeso yeah, overall i would say this a better choice than the motorola w376g, and the worth the extra ten dollars.", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Smooth, clean, easy!", "Author": "Mayidunk", "ReviewID": "R2A9TJ7UAV3FA9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LG600G is an excellent phone!Transferring my minutes and phone number from my old TracFone was painless using Tracfone's website, and I didn't have to wait days for the transfer to be complete.

Ironically, the only place I had problems was in my house, where I had problems getting a signal to place a call. I suspect this is related to something in my house (metal doors?), as I was fine if I stuck my arm outside the door and was fine in a number of other buildings. At home, once I placed the call and it started ringing, I could step back indoors and reception was fine. Note: see addition belowI have found tracfone customer service spotty. I lost this phone a few days ago and called and asked if someone could buy minutes without a password using the phone (I have never done this, so didn't know); the customer service rep really didn't know--never answered my question--and I finally had him deactivate the phone.  He claims I will not lose minutes when I get another one (we will see). I had a Motorola tracfone before this one and did have some problems trying to transfer minutes to the LG via the web, but the customer service was very helpful with this issue.  This LG phone seemed to get better reception (signal) than the Motorola, which was one of the cheapest flip tracfones, I think it was a W260. I am subscribed to their monthly service at $10 for 100 minutes (after double), and I did once have a problem that they did not double the minutes, but one phone call to customer service cleared this up and it did not reoccur.The bluetooth feature is nice for ringtone transfer from a computer and photo transfer to a computer. I am not \"into\" ringtones, but kept finding that my phone would ring and I'd be waiting for someone to answer and finally my friends would say \"answer it, it's yours\". This may be because I didn't buy a cell phone for a long time after they got one! But having a unique ringtone (mine is a coyote howl) means I no longer do this. This phone lets you send photos to a PC via the bluetooth, which, according to some reviews, is unusual for tracfone (other models require sending by using minutes). I have done this transfer type once and it was no problem.Added note:  Due to the loss of the other LG600, I ordered another one from the Tracfone site. It was a \"remanufactured\" one, but actually gets better signal inside my house than the other one did. Customer service took a long time on the phone to get my minutes switched to this phone, however, they constantly came back and checked with me--didn't leave me hanging on hold forever, wondering if they had forgotten me. When I deactivated the lost phone, the rep neglected to tell me that I'd lose my old phone number, however when I activated the new one, the rep arranged with another dept. to assign that number to the new phone as it had not been given out to anyone yet.Further added note.I have had the replacement phone about a year now.  It no longer gets much of any reception in the house. Don't know if this is the phone or some change in the towers. I sometimes have problems getting a signal in the yard, even. This is partly a geography problem, I think, as I can get good signal in town--but the deterioration is dismaying.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Started out good, ended up bad", "Author": "Ronald E.

I usually upgrade about once a year max two years. I have always chosen the Motorola phones as they seemed to offer the best bang for the buck in my areas. This time that was not the case. This phone seemed to offer more of the features that I wanted so I decided to try something new. What a humongous mistake.I got the phone fully charged it and then proceeded to activate it online as I have done for so many phones. It would not allow me to activate online. I was told the phone required purchase of an airtime card in order to be \"reactivated\". The it asked if I was still in Florida. Huh??? This phone is brand new direct from Amazon in all the original retail packaging and including all the new package documents and coupons. There's also the fact I have never been to Florida. How incredibly annoying. For those who don't know each new Tracfone comes with ten minutes of airtime and sixty days of service. When you activate online you get an additional ten free minutes for a total of twenty free minutes.I would have had to call customer service anyway in order to transfer my remaining minutes to the new phone. I have always done this when upgrading phones. I only wanted to activate it online because I had moved since buying my previous phone and wanted a new local number for my current area. Tracfone customer service is tedious and slow but much better today than years ago. The second representative told me I would have to give them a phone number so they could call me back in twenty-four hours. Since it was Tuesday evening that actually meant waiting until Thursday to maybe get the problem fixed. My old phones service expired in five days so that was not an option.Finally I asked for a supervisor. I could not figure out why he just didn't go through the process of activating, transferring minutes and adding service days to my new phone. I have gone through that process numerous times. The supervisor got on the line, listened to what my problem was and what I needed done. She apologized for the inconvenience then started the process of setting up my new phone. When we were done, a total time of seventy-five minutes, I was told I should receive my phone number within one hour and my service days and minutes within no longer than 72 hours but most likely with the hour. Truthfully, based on prior experience it is usually instantaneous or happens within one hour unless a weekend or holiday. Finally I got the new number but no minutes and no service.Hours later nothing had changed. I logged into my Tracfone web account. I was immediately informed that there was a problem with my new phone. I followed the on screen prompts for multiple code entries and finally everything on the phone was updated and correct. I had my original leftover minutes plus twenty free minutes and sixty-four days of service (60 days for new phone + 4 days left on old phone). The nightmare was over. At least that's what I thought.This morning I began the tedious task of inputting my contacts into my phone. I hit the save button and was left with a swirling screen. The swirling screen usually lasts seconds, but this time it did not go away. After several minutes I tried powering it off hoping it would reset. It powered off. I waited about thirty seconds and powered it back on. It stopped at the LG boot screen and refused to go any further. Over the next hours I tried everything in the book to reset this phone. I took the battery out for one half hour before putting it back in. I searched the web and tried removing the battery and sim card, pressing power button continuously to drain remaining power, reinstalled sim and battery and powered back up after waiting about twenty minutes. You guessed it, still frozen on the boot screen.I was forced to call Tracfone technical support. After attempting to get it to reset via same method I tried and calling the number, they concluded something was wrong with the phone and they offered to replace it. I declined. I'll be returning this hunk of junk to Amazon as soon as I get another, non-LG phone to transfer my minutes and service to.The phone is very attractive, paired easily with my bluetooth headset, is lightweight and has a nice color display. Other thing I don't like are that I keep hitting the side volume control buttons by accident, there appears now way to assign the soft keys, web key or camera key or organize the menu. My Motorola phones had the Personalize menu which allowed me to choose what applications were accessed by the navigation pad and soft keys. I was also able to set up my menu in any order I wanted. I really hate that this phone does not do that and makes the mobile web button, which sucks units quickly, a one touch button. My husband liked the way the keypad feels, but I have long nails which make navigating any mobile phone difficult. I can not recommend a phone that has so many problemsUPDATE! I took a risk and got the phone replaced. Amazon was great about getting me my replacement very quickly. The second phone worked flawlessly from the start and has continued to work without problems.

Tracfone requires that you designate the area code in which the phone will be used primarily [San Jose, CA]. Fair enough -- calls from other area codes are than charged as roaming. Also, I want to use the phone in San Diego and in most areas of San Diego and other areas of California the phone works. However, there is an half mile area, more or less, around my office where the phone does not work -- \"emergency calls only\" with five bars signal strength. How do I know this?  I walked in various directions from the office, checking the phone performance every 1-2 blocks until I could actually dial out.Thus, for my purposes, the phone is useless in San Diego.I have two other Tracfones [an older Nokia 1100 and a Motorola V170] -- both work just fine in all areas of San Diego.Now for the customer review part: When in San Diego, I called customer review and was told that I must call from the primary use area to resolve the problem. When I returned to San Jose, I was told that I must call when in San Diego to resolve the problem. I was told that the problem might be that I was trying to use the phone outside of the primary area -- Why would Tracfome sell a phone that worked only in a small area of the country? So far I have spent over three hours on the phone and on hold while I am shuttled from \"Supervisor\" to \"Supervisor\", none of whom were really helpful. Apt descriptions might be robotic/pleasant/lacking competency/able to read the English language script adequately.The \"last straw\": When the phone is activated, Tracfone includes 20 minutes and sixty days of air time. The air time on this phone will expire March 15 -- I am not going to be in San Diego until March 19. Since the last message was that I had to call from San Diego to help them \"research\" the problem, I asked for an additional 10 days of air time [not minutes]to March 25...didn't feel like buying more air time and throwing good money after bad. Another 30 minutes and more supervisors later, I was begrudgingly granted another five days of air time -- to March 20.

I just spent a long time on the phone going over all sorts of information because they need to send us phones that will work here and we need to send the phones we got through Amazon to Tracfone.  Plus, in order to keep my same number, I had to give up all my minutes for 72 hours!  I checked back on Amazon and saw no warning that the phone may not be compatible with the buyer's area.  Who knows?  Maybe Target is supposed to be aware of which phones go to which areas.

This cell phone is supposed to be an upgrade from the LG600G that just died on me.  So I bought the UPgrade. NO such luck. The LG420 is not any better in any regard as far as I can tell. I have been on and off the Tracfone help phone lines about 6 times, each time you wait for 5 - 10 minutes, then get someone who always needs to ask a supervisor who is always too busy to help the person helping you, so you sit and wait. Right this second I am 41 minutes and 33 seconds into my SIXTH call to TracFone. I have only had this damn phone two weeks. This is the last time I will ever use TracFone OR LG - and I have been using them for just over FIVE YEARS.  They lost a loyal customer.Back to the phone - there just is no real user manual...they will send you what they think is one, but it is just a quick guide that is 12 pages long and mostly useless.  The graphics are supposed to be better, but really not - AND - the font size is actually SMALLER. Not everyone has the eyes of a 20 yr old! How stupid of LG. They also killed the setting option to put phone on Vibrate THEN ring. Everyone I know uses this setting. I could with the old phone, but the so-called upgrade does not have the option. Also, the ringtones that come with it are just a dozen really crap ones you won't want to use.  I wish the old LG 600 did not die - this upgrade has just only served to up my blood pressure.LMFAO the help person just gave me my third ticket number ... I did not even bother to write it down. Total call time 47 minutes 2 seconds.Also research problem with using the Alarm feature. It works, but will kill your battery in under one day. You actually have to fully turn the phone on and off  after each alarm goes off. Otherwise the phone will be dead and you think you still have several days of battery left.DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "porting is impossible", "Author": "Spaypets", "ReviewID": "R2IS67NY803T00", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Good luck porting your number from an existing tracfone to a new one.
