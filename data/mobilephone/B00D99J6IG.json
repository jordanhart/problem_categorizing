{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great 4g LTE Phone For Boost Mobile", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R1M4R3AP84X5WW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Boost Mobile customers will be excited to see the new LG F7 with 4g LTE, which is about four times faster than Boost's older Wi-Max network and ten times faster than its painfully slow 3g network.NOTE: Sprint/Boost provide 4G LTE service to only about 50% of American homes. Use the coverage map on the Boost Mobile website to zoom in on your neighborhood and verify 4G LTE signal quality. DO NOT buy a Boost phone unless there is strong 4G LTE service on your block.Avoid Boost phones that use its Wi-Max network, such as the Samsung SII. Boost has begun shutting down its Wi-Max network to shift resources to its new and expanding 4g LTE network.With its large and sharp screen, the F7 matches the high quality of the Samsung Galaxy SIII while providing DOUBLE the battery life, about ten hours of average use, compared with just five hours on the Samsung SIII.The camera takes good photos and adequate videos. Music sounds okay through the rear speaker and sounds great with high quality ear buds. There is enough memory to add 4 gb of apps and an SD card slot to add all of your music and videos.The processor is fast enough to handle demanding apps and most games will play smoothly. Netflix movies look great on the large, very high quality screen. Look for a case on Amazon that has a rear kickstand to make it easier to watch videos. Amazon has a good case selection.If you want 4G LTE but in a very compact, light weight phone, look at the LG F3, available from Sprint, Virgin Mobile, MetroPCS, and T-Mobile.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lg Optimus F7", "Author": "Raymond Gomez", "ReviewID": "R3HB1JBA10NVSS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sold my Htc One Sv from Boost Mobile just to purchase this phone and wow, what a huge difference.Call Quality, people hear me crystal clear unless im in a poor area that doesnt get great reception.GPS-Navigation/ Well, i know im not the only one because many people on the boost mobile wbsite comment on it, The gps always seems to have a hard time finding my current location and i have used gps many times before and have gotten either lost or arrived late do to it, i downloaded another app, mapquest, which made it easier for me, still noy completely satisfied, and if gps is a majot attraction for you, you may want to rethink.Screen Display, OMG, What a huge difference, when im home and i have wifi on, videos on youtube will be displayed in HD and wow pixels and movie trailers are so crystal clear. I Love the 720p display.Processor/ 1.5 Dual core, i love the new feature of LG that allows me to watch a video (phone or sd storage only) and continue playing it while i browse the internet, text, or do anything else for that matter. Candy crush looks so vivid and so beautiful compared to my old htc one sv.Speaker/ Music- Music is loud enough for me to play.The phone feels good in my hands, i have huge hands and the phone fits perfect. The back casing of the phone gets covered up with finger prints alot due to the style of it but a case can just fix that.Overall, i really love the 720p display,processor,videos,games,facebook,internet and pictures look so vivid and beautiful.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG M7, 14 hour talk time?!

This is the only phone I've ever had where the battery truly does last ALL day!  The phone is fast and responsive. So far, it hasn't slowed a bit even though I've downloaded a bunch of apps and games. The quick memo and q slide features have come in handy. The phone is comfortable to hold, even with a dual protective case. I haven't had any issues with the volume or speakers at all. The camera is so so, but there is a flash. There is also a front facing camera for skyping and selfies.  4G is a huge improvement over my old phone's 3G capability. I use it mainly for Internet browsing, Facebook, email, texting, games, YouTube, shopping, etc. I have absolutely zero complaints!

I expected way more from LG.  Photos are grainy, outdoor photo was sun-streaked.  Every time I use the hands-free speaker phone, callers cannot hear me.  I agree with Abraham's review here.  Watched a Netflix documentary...FAST technology(am only able to get 3G with Boost), good video quality, poor audio quality.  In re:to the comment receiving 1star, it's true;  I had to call Boost three times(I have been with them 21 months) before I got the super helpful and friendly gentleman who had actually read the training manual for this phone.  First guy pretended to activate phone, second guy asked if I could move to another \"area\", meaning away from my listed zip code, to see if I could get service, and claimed the system was under repair in my \"area\" despite the fact that my Samsung was working fine five minutes prior.  I was up and running pretty painlessly after the third phone call.  Planning to return LG for the SIII.  But otherwise, my cell phone service with Boost has been better than all other carriers I've had in my area of the Mississippi River Valley outside of Rochester Minnesota so would give Boost service 5 stars for the price.

I love the big screen, I'm able to see Iphone emojis! && I'm able to use my Swype!

It will come brand new in a pretty orange Boost box. When you call Boost they will recognized the MEID number and seem to be helping you but you will be told phone call after phone call that they cannot activate the phone right now. First wait three hours and call back. Then be told 24 to 72 hours before they can get it going. If I every get it activated I will let you know if it is a good phone. But Boost is sabotaging any phone sold on Amazon.Further updateWell this is a good Phone now that I have it working. It took Boost 1 week from the date I had the phone in my hand to get it working on their network.

Bought this phone because it seemed to had a lot of features a a reasonable price, plus I though I couldn't go wrong buying LG .It's Ok, as long as you don't mind SOUND quality. The speaker crackles like an 1930's radio and even when you use without it you have to ask people to repeat because the sound quality is horrendous, when I try to use it on my car with the hands free feature I hear people complaining that my voice sound too far and I have to shout at the phone to be heard.
