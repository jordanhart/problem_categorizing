{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A non data users delight", "Author": "J. Davis", "ReviewID": "R22OQMU8X5SWI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a wonderfully designed phone for people who don't have a data plan and don't want one.  It gets great reception, makes clear calls and will do texting if you so desire.  The main menu is super user friendly and it has some useful built in apps.  The GPS Maps and navigation are free and you don't have to access the wireless internet to use them.  You can download them with your home computer over your home internet connection and transfer them to the phone with the Nokia Ovi software suite.  The FM radio and MP3 player work well.  This little unlocked phone is far better than anything AT&T; is currently offering for people who are not interested in accessing the internet with their cell phones.  The freedom from AT&T;'s locked phone software is a huge plus and greatly simplifies the phones menu navigation and ease of use.  I put in the AT&T; SIM, 4 GB of extra memory and the battery and the phone fired right up.  Only minimal configuration was required to meet my particular desire to have the GPS function never access the internet and to run the network in GSM only mode to save battery life since I never access the 3G network.  If you are not technically inclined you need not do anything and you will be no worse off than AT&T;'s locked phone default configuration.  The setup menus are very user friendly.  I had no problem removing the back cover as some other comments suggested.  The camera is nothing special and lacks auto focus but does have a flash.  It is about equivalent in picture quality to a throw away snap shot camera.  I highly recommend this phone to any non data cell phone user.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quality Practical PHONE - as originally intended", "Author": "Stephen Davis \"Caramel Cyclist\"", "ReviewID": "RY0UR0CUDZE8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Every year, phones become more like computers. People walk around glued to their touchscreen internet devices, oblivious to the world around them. Trying to have a conversation with a huge tablet plastered to the side of your face is cumbersome. The brain radiation (SAR rating) from tablet phones is dangerously high, with the antenna situated adjacent to the ear-speaker.These are a few considerations why I gladly abandoned the materialistic quest for the biggest baddest \"smart phone\", and chose to return to the most valuable form of communcation - the human voice.  This phone is ergonomically pleasant to use for voice calls.  The clarity for both parties is almost as good as a land line.  The antenna is actually situated at the bottom of the handset, farthest from the brain.Text messaging is brisk with T9, organizer shortcuts are intuitive and customizable, display is clear and bright.  This phone is the industry's best kept secret.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent replacement for your GSM carrier's non-smartphone phone.", "Author": "Randomness", "ReviewID": "RWNSXS63GOP8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to replace someone else's \"free\" flip phone given by AT&T; (which started to have random glitches after irreversible firmware update). That person does not want or need any smartphone functionality, and for this purpose, this phone is a perfect replacement. It is very compact, it works on all non-3G GSM bands (doesn't seem to be working with AT&T;'s 3G frequency, but that is not important for a phone like this), it has a good reception in all zones covered by AT&T; and a pretty good battery life.The body has a minimal set of buttons - no silly PTT (push-to-talk) or media player dedicated buttons on outside (which tend to be pressed randomly on other models and thus require the usage of key lock function, which is annoying), just a volume up/down button on the right side. The front display is minimalistic, but it does its function perfectly and displays all the needed info (current time or Caller ID info) using a perfectly legible and elegant-looking font. There are 2 charger \"ports\" on outside, one is USB (the \"micro USB\" kind) and the one is the round plug which requires the (included) proprietary charger. The phone can be charged through either of them and they are not covered by rubber \"flaps\", which is less \"annoying\" than other phones where you have to almost break your nails trying to extract the little rubber/plastic flap out of charging port.The software is also minimalistic but pretty functional, with all functions required by such phone working perfectly and easy to set up (you have to do a little bit of typing setting up MMS/WEB gateway settings for AT&T; network (visit AT&T;'s official forums, the Nokia section, to read about necessary settings), but if you don't need these functions everything else is pretty self-explanatory and don't require any \"user manual\" or Google searches to set up). The GPS function works with AT&T;'s \"Family Map\" tracking service, though you do need to enable data usage for GPS function to be able to locate this phone's user with more precision and with shorter time, but the data usage is very insignificant and you don't have to do that if you don't use the \"Family Map\" service.What else... The built-in camera works well for its intended function - obviously not as good as similar cameras on smartphones but better than majority of cameras on other non-smartphones. Oh, and some people complained about the back cover being somewhat difficult to remove - it's true, it is initially difficult to remove it, but you can learn (after a few tries) to remove it easily, it just requires finding a right \"spot\" to press while pulling the cover, and the cover itself is made out of pretty flexible plastic so it is highly unlikely that you might break it (unless you are a very, very impatient person) and you don't need to remove it at all if you don't need to change your SIM card. Overall it is one of the best non-smartphone models I have ever had pleasure dealing with and I highly recommend it if all you need is to make calls and maybe occasionally send/receive a SMS/MMS message.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good basic phone", "Author": "Dantrax", "ReviewID": "R2PS30CLD86F0F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has a larger display than my old nokia so it's easier to see when I'm texting, good battery life, good signal strenght, a decent camera, if you're used to nokia features-they're all there & some seem improved.

I saved $20.00 per month by eliminating the data portion and only getting the 1000 text message plan for $10.00 per month.  Camera has a flash and takes great pictures, music is really clear and sounds great.  Voice communication is really clear and one of the best phones I've had and I've had a few.  Smart phones are okay for the working people but I'm retired and only need the basics, which this phone gives you.  Price was low and phone is one of my  best.

This is never going to replace an actual GPS or Google Maps on an Iphone, but if you're not expecting it to do that then it's a nice little feature.I switched to this from the LG Renoir, which has an 8 megapixel camera, WIFI etc etc but absolutely terrible call quality and was not at all user-friendly and am very happy with the switch.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Make sure that you only want a simple basic flip phone", "Author": "Jason O.

I KIND OF WANT TO BUY ANOTHER K1 BUTCANNOT USE SONGS FOR RING TONE.  SO AFTER SEARCH FOR A FLIP PHONE I DECIDED TO PICK THE 3710. BOUGHT FOR $99 AT AMAZON WITH FREE 4GB MICROSD. BEST PRICE ON NET. I'M NOT A WEB OR TEXT TYPE PERSON. AND I HAVE T MOBILE PRE-PAIDED MINUTES. SO TO THE POINT . LOVE  THE PHONE . SMALL AND COMPACT . THE BUTTONS ARE BIG AND HAVE A VERY GOOD TOUCH WHEN U PRESS IT. THAT WAS MY BIGGEST WORRY AFTER CHECKING OTHER CHEAP FLIP PHONE IN STORES.  HAVE EVERYTHING I WANTED. A CAMERA, MUSIC PLAYER, EASY TO USE, ETC. ONLY ONE THING I HATE ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THE #$%@#ING BATTERY COVER IS A &^%* TO REMOVE AND INSTALL.  THE COVER SLIDE IN AND OUT . THE PROBLEM IS IT'S VERY TIGHT AND THE COVER IS SILICONE LIKE SURFACE.  TOOK ME 30 MINUTES TO REMOVE THE COVER AND REINSTALL IT. I HAVE TO USE A DAMPER CLOTH TO GRIP THE COVER AND PRESS VERY VERY HARD. NOKIA SHOULD JUST USE A BUTTON LATCH LIKE MY K1. LUCKILY THIS DAMN PHONE IS BUILD EXTREMELY TOUGH. THANK GOODNESS. I WAS SO PISSED OFF AND AFRAID I MIGHT BREAK THIS PHONE BY SQUEEZING SO HARD ON IT. I AM 5'10\" GUY. I WOULD HAVE GIVE IT A 5 STAR AND PLUS. BUT THE DAMN COVER. SO IF U ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A QUALITY FLIP PHONE, THIS IS THE BEST. SMALL THIN COMPACT. THIS IS IT. ONE MORE THING MAKE SURE U READ THE MANUAL TO INSTALL THE MICROSD CARD. U NEED TO SLIDE THE HOLDER INWARD AND IT WILL FLIP UP. DO NOT TRY TO FLIP IT UP WITHOUT SLIDING INWARD OR U WILL BREAK IT. HOPE THIS REVIEW HELP U .

Ross \"mick\"", "ReviewID": "R3VREV0P8R3F6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First - I am shocked at the $30 rise in price in just two weeks for this well-made phone from Nokia. The only thing I can figure is this phone is not manufactured by Nokia anymore, per their web site (it's in their 'archive').That aside, it is a great phone with excellent vocal clarity. The built-in voice recognition is also good. The Nokia's speed dial (unlike the LG LG230 Dimson) is able to assign different phone numbers belonging to the same person (e.g. a speed-dial number for your wife's work and a speed-dial number for you wife's cell). A note regarding 'voice dialing': No need to say \"call\" etc. - just say the person's name. E.g. \"John Smith, Mobile\"PROSExcepts up to 8GB microSD RAMSpeed dial number oriented (allows more than one speed-dial number per phone book entry)Works well with Bluetooth: Tested with Bluetooth Headsets Jawbone ICON and Plantronics Discovery 975FOIBLESBattery CoverAs with other evaluations, the back of this phone is (putting it mildly) DIFFICULT to remove once the battery is inserted. I suspect the battery forcing the cover up along with the unusual hinge angle over the earphone jack as the cause of the difficulty. I have been successful in carefully prising the cover off the phone: the but-end and then the two sides so they snap loose; then carefully raise the end to unhinge the back from around the earphone jack. Poor design for the sake of elegance. Hopefully, Nokia gets it right on the next flip-phone cover design - WAIT - there is no Nokia flip phone on the American market.15 October 2011 Correction to above comment regarding 'voice dialing': This phone cannot be instructed to pick one of many numbers assigned to a phone book entry - it uses the 'default' number only.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone is great, BUT", "Author": "W.

The main reason I purchased this phone is because of its quad-band versatility (I was traveling to Great Britain) and I wanted to be able to use it on my travels.  The #1 reason for my low-rating is because of the back cover.  The ONLY way I am able to even get it off is with rubber kitchen gloves and I did not have rubber kitchen gloves available to me when I was in the UK trying to put the SIM card in.  My fiance broke the prongs holding the back cover onto the phone just trying to get the thing off and now it looks ridiculous.  The camera is nice and delivers great photos, but when I am on a call and someone calls in via call-waiting, there isn't any tone or beep letting me know someone else is calling me.
