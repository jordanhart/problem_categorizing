{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An extremely nice surprise.", "Author": "Reinaldo Torrales", "ReviewID": "RA0UJWMVJENLO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for an unlocked Android 4.0 phone. After doing some research, reading some reviews I narrowed it down to this phone. On paper it seems to have all the features I wanted: Android 4.0.4, large screen, unlocked, dual SIM and an affordable price. I must say, I see people who order things from China and I was a bit skeptical. So, I took a leap of faith and I ordered this phone. It took about 5-6 days to get the order confirmation. Once the order was processed it took a few more days to get the package out and delivery took around 7 days. Not bad if when the estimated delivery date was somewhere in or after October 10th. I got my phone after Labor Day holiday (Sept 4). So, very pleased with the delivery and the packaging was good too. It came in an envelope but inside the envelope the original from factory box was wrapped on layers and layers of bubble wraps. It's worth to mention the factory box was also very sturdy and capable to resist bumps and heavier objects, in short, not your typical cardboard box many electronic ship these days. That was a plus considering the long trip from China. About the phone, the phone came with two batteries, wired earphone and microphone, charger with USB cable, plastic clip-on shell(it gets keep a better grip as the phone fairly thin). The cable for the charger also works as USB cable for the PC. The phone came loaded with Android 4.0.4 dated to August 2012 (no bad!). The screen is huge, it feels you are holding a mini-mini tablet. It feel sturdy and well built. This was one of my concerns when i ordered, but once I opened the box I was very satisfied with the built quality and materials. I like the big screen, it's crisp , bright, very responsive, no dead pixels or lag. Multi-touch works great. I installed my T-mobile SIM and it worked without any additional action. I also used Wifi to make internet calls and it works good. I installed Viber and Imo and they both work good for internet calls. Viber seems to have better sound, but more attenuation, Imo seems to have better connectivity but the sound is way lower (maybe smaller data packets?). Of course, I installed Angry Birds, the big screen makes it great to play. The phone has two cameras, both worked flawlessly. I was able to switch cameras and take pics without any problem. The quality is acceptable considering the price, I mean, i hear people bitch about bad quality pics from phone's cameras and they seem to forget, its a phone not a camera. Ok, back to the review. The phone comes with GPS, I haven't tried it. It comes with TV and even small antenna. So far it seems to have capability for analog, in USA that's pretty much useless as all TV signals are digital. Not sure if there is an app or if the phone will allow digital signal. Anyway, i didn't buy the phone for that reason. It would be a nice to have but not a must have. Calls are nice and clear. No dropping no problems. I only noticed it gets a bit warm after 15-20mins of use during a call. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and I would certainly recommend. One last thing, just for reference, the phone seems to have great similarity with Samsung Galaxy Note.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth every penny!", "Author": "M. Mickey", "ReviewID": "R35A7IHJJ9V0QG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The seller was great as well as the phone. Had mine working in 5 minutes after I charged the battery.The first thing you need to do is set ENGLISH as the language if thats what you speak. Otherwise everything is in Chinese. There are sever web sites on there from China and you can delete them. Google shows up in the China version but all you need to do is change the ending fron .CN to .COM same for Yahoo.Phone quality is clear and crisp. Camera works better than most others I have seen. I would recommend that you install a mini SD card and put your downloads on it rather than taking up phone memory.Phone is thin compared to an I phone. Battery is easy to get at and you will get 2 batteries , a cover and an installed screen protectoe if you get the expidited shipping. It is only $14 plus you will get the phone in about a week.All the features work very well but the TV is useless in the USA. Manual comes with it but it could be a little better but you can say that for most every phone.I would get another one like this if I needed it and would recommend it to anyone that wants a bigger screen and doesn't want to get sucked into another 2 year contract. Once you put in the SIM card you are good to go.I was asked  which supplier I purchased my phone from, it was the Super Saving Store. I hope that answers your question.I have had this phone for several months and still think it is great. I did want to add some additional information. The phone is a knockoff of a Samsung, has almost all the same features and looks like a Samsung Galaxy BUT , Samsung Galaxy batteries will not fit this phone. I keep my phones for a long time. I did get a second battery with the phone but figured I should get a couple more just in case one went bad. I found that the batteries for an N8000 , which this is, are available from DHgate.com for about $12.00 for 2 including shipping. Takes about 4 weeks to get them but now I feel better with extra batteries in hand.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Has its pros and cons", "Author": "DevonKate", "ReviewID": "RMUPZ4R3W6RK7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the phone for a little over a month nowPros:-Box comes packed with accessories. Two batteries. Car charger. Regular charger socket (I requested an Irish and American one and they were happy to oblige). USB cable that fits the socket. Earphones (mine were broken). Instruction manual. Plastic case. 8gb micro SD card.-Screen Protector already fitted.-Runs latest version Android (Ice Cream Sandwich)-Looks very good-Dual SIM function very easy to use. I have both an Irish and American SIM card in at all times and it flawlessly works both at the same time. I receive messages and calls etc. from both when they come in. When sending messages or making phone calls it asks which SIM you would like to use. I have it set to default for one of them (depending on which country I'm in) so it doesn't bother me by asking.-Battery lasts a decent amount of time. I am a hardcore phone user, generally flicking through images and videos online and texting non stop. Battery lasts me for about 6 hours of solid use so should last all day for normal use. The included spare battery is very handy.-Takes micro USB charger (International standard charger)-No problems with signal or dropping calls like some other users have reported.-Speakers are very loud, great for playing music.-Takes panoramic photos. Difficult to get used to but a great feature when used correctly.-Resilient. I've dropped it a few times now and it hasn't been damaged yet. I've been trying to find a case for it but haven't found any that I like on Amazon as of yet. Some other users recommend Samsung Galaxy Note cases for it (they fit when the plastic back is on it according to some reviews)Cons:-Doesn't charge while in use. When I have it plugged in and I have the screen awake the battery percentage doesn't increase (nor does it decrease). I charge it overnight for this reason so it's not a big deal.-Sometimes shuts off when I unplug the charger but turns back on then.-T.V. function is for analogue T.V. only which has been replaced by digital in most countries worldwide so I haven't been able to use this function.-When I received it the home key button was actually scratched pretty badly. The rest of the phone looked flawless though and this didn't bother me enough to request a replacement.-Occasionally the touch screen misbehaves or becomes unresponsive. I find this happens frequently with the charger that was included. I just use an old Samsung charger that I have. The included charger is a bit short also.-The charger port is a little loose. I find that my Samsung charger falls out when moved at all. USB cables fit it perfectly though (which doesn't really make sense as they're supposed to be the same size..?)-Camera and flash not very good. My previous phone also had a 5MP camera with flash and in comparison the Star takes really low quality photos. The flash is the worst flash I have every seen on anything. It is literally just a light. A very dim light at that.Biggest pro is obviously the price. That cannot be beaten!Biggest con is the camera/flash.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not what I was expecting!", "Author": "carmen1725", "ReviewID": "R1BFQWQX5A1ZVZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I felt like I had to review this phone because although this phone is great it has a few minor flaws but what handheld system doesn't?Shipping and ordering:I received my phone in about 6 business days with expedited shipping which I think was great considering my phone came out of Hong Kong.  I admit I was really skeptical of buying out of my country but I took a chance on this phone and it came perfect.  The packaging was great and looked like it could survive a couple of rough bumps which was great considering the long trip it had to the states.  If you are thinking of buying this phone do not buy from anyone but amazon.  They will keep your information safe and monitor the entire trip.  However it would have been nice to have tracking information available but I did not worry about it.Receiving the phone and T-Mobile coverage:In the box I received a phone, 2 batteries, a wall charger, 3 screen protectors (one already installed), a usb cable and a set of headphones.  Everything was in excellent condition and worked great!  Immediately when I got the phone I installed my t-mobile sim card and inserted a 8gb micro sd card which I recommend because the internal memory tends to get crowded pretty quickly.  It took me about 10 minutes to get my plan and service going and about 6 hours for the internet to start working.I thought it was great how t-mobile noticed that i could not use the internet so they sent me instructions on how to set it up.  It took me about 5 minutes and after I had full functioning service.  I noticed without the wi-fi on, the phone internet is kinda laggy but still faster than most phones I had in the past.  Be sure that whatever service you plan on using that it works in your area.About the phone:This phone is easy to maneuver and very responsive.  I like how it was not overstocked with pre-installed apps that I would find no use for.  The only one that I find unnecessary is the television feature.  Although it would have been nice to have, we do not have any use for it in the states.  It does have an antenna but its located inside the phone and actually looks like a stylus pin from afar.The battery life on this phone is great. It does take a while to fully charge, but even on 50% I tend to get about 6 hours of battery life before it dies on me.  I think its great that 2 batteries are included so your phone should last a while on one charge.The phone comes with the goggle play store already installed and was amazed at how many apps come included.  I got apps that even my old virgin mobile phone could not get!  A lot of the apps are free and I suggest you put them on your sd card so can enjoy all of your apps without having to delete them off the phone to make room.The phone runs on android 4.0.4 which allow for a great browsing experience when you are playing with this phone.  I get 3g service in most places in my area which I think was great considering I paid under $200 for this phone that looks like it could be worth $500.The camera on this phone is decent for the price.  Even in dim light I can take great pictures with the back camera, however the front camera is grainy sometimes even when there is light in the room.  I think it is great also that this phone takes screen shots (just hold down the top power button and the down key on the volume button)Accessories and the cons:When I first got this phone I immediately looked for a case for it and got nothing.  Instead I took a chance on a galaxy note case that was made of tough rubber and it fits great.  Not like a glove but I know my phone is not going anywhere.  Although the buttons are off,  there is enough room in the case where I can just simply press and it will work fine.  But if you wanted to use your headphones you would have to take the case off.There is only one con about this phone I noticed in the few days I had it is that when I am charging the phone and I try to use it, the buttons tend to have a mind of its and decides to do what it wants.  When I take the phone off the charger it works fine again so I try not to mess with it while its charging.  This is the only reason the phone does not get 5 stars but it is still a great phone either way.Overall I really like this phone.  I feel that I made a great purchase and had a great seller also (thankyou abettershop!) I would recommend this for anyone who is a beginner android user or if you just want a cheap android phone with great features.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "good phone for a good price", "Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "R1HQYMUHKWZY2P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered the Star N8000 from lolbuy on Nov.15 and recieved it in the mail on Nov.23. The phone says its 5\" but its really 5.3\". There is no case for this phone so i ordered 2 GALAXY NOTE N7000/19220 cases from amazon one hard case and one silicone case to see how they would fit. For the hard case just type in (White and Hot Pink Dual layer hybrid cover case and kickstand for samsung galaxy note N7000/19220 $3.62). For soft case I ordered(Pink cassette tape silicone case for galaxy note n7000/19220 $3.80). The hybrid case fits my phone pretty good but the case covers up the power on button and volume key which is fine cause I just press the middle button to turn my phone on and i never really use the volume button. I can charge my phone up fine and take pics using back camera with case on so thats all that matters to me. The silicone case fits good too you can easily press volume and power on button. I am with tmobile prepaid $30 100min unlimited text and web plan I downloaded skype and pay $3/month for unlimted talk thats my way of getting around the 100min tmbobile gives so I only pay $33/month and pretty much have unlimited everythang. Put sim card in and it works pretty good. I like this phone because it is compatible with tmobile,att,straight talk,and simple mobile. So if you get tired of one company you can just buy a sim card for a different company and pop sim in phone after activating. what I like most about this phone is that it has video wallpaper, so you can set any video on your sd card as your wallpaper. You can use this phone as hotspot. Volume is very loud when playing movies. You can easily sinc movies/music from computer to phone using usb cord, some phones wont do that. The camera and camcorder isnt that good but it'll do if you're around alot of light. All apps I downloaded so far seem to work like facebook, youtube,angry birds, temple run etc... The phone works pretty fast when on the web without wifi although youtube runs very slow but thats because I only get 2g speed with my tmobile plan but works very fast with wifi. Also if you want phone in white after you order the phone just go to contact this seller under myaccount and tel them you want phone in white in the email and they will send you a white one thats what I did. I would definately recommend this phone for the size and price you cant beat that. I love my phone thanks DANIEL CHEN", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "N8000 Good Buy!", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R3FDNH1UYSUDKW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "N8000 Clone Note 5 inch came in and looked like someone had ordered it and returned had phone numbers in itthe volume button was a little loose and the camera flash was loose being that I needed a cell phone asapI tightened the flash lens with hot glue problem solved. The phone that came was not the same pictured no TV really who cares about that and the camera was on the left top corner not as the description pic in the middle OK still no big deal. Outside the camera takes good pics for what it is inside up close good far away not so good, flash works good and there is an app in the phone for a flash light pretty cool. Screen fine works nice for the price and it is fast I would suggest putting in an app to increase volume that helped a lot. Speaker phone is oknot the greatest but, neither is my husbands $600.00 phone. Now lets get to the dual sims love love I haveSTRAIGHT TALK GMS ordered a sim and put it in put in APN settings it sounds hard but, it's not and I had service in 10 minutes so, all the ones that watched you tube trying to find out if it works on ST it does as long as it says in the phone description GMS 850m/1800m/1900m 3G UNLOCKED and because it is dual sim you can have two numbers just go to a pre pay WCDMA provider and there you go two line switch back and forth.Remember this does not have all the bells and whistles the $600.00 phone has it still is a nice cell it comes with two batteries which is nice ( Ok battery life when not using wifi, bluetooth turn off and install an app killer and adjust screen brightness will help)  and the wifi connected fine the phone found it put in my password and I was off and surfing.

REVISED:now quite happy", "Author": "DJ Bayer", "ReviewID": "RYA4IMF668BK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was accustomed to using Android 4 on my rooted Verizon Thunderbolt and wanted an unlocked phone that had those features. Naturally this one stood out in that regard so given the solid reviews I jumped. After a couple of weeks using it I don't regret the purchase but had some rough moments. As I look back those were caused by my lack of familiarity with getting a phone going with a sim card (Straight Talk) on a network I hadn't used before (AT&T;). The Straight Talk telephone support was not helpful (they weren't familiar with the phone) so I suffered through on my own, finally getting into the 3g network, where I have been since.The phone came as advertised. All software/firmware functions worked well. I was up and running with my google play account right away through wireless. All my apps downloaded and ran without a hitch. The phone size and weight are great. I typically carry it in a shirt pocket. Display is good (but don't expect amoled), battery life quite good for a smartphone (more than my Thunderbolt with an extended battery). Screen protector is a necessity--no gorilla glass here. I put in a 32gb micro SD and transferred most programs to it. The lights next to the front camera never worked, but I can easily live without them. I read in a review that the camera flash wasn't much anyway. Certainly the camera isn't up to today's smartphone standards. Grainy pictures that aren't near as clear as the ones taken by my Thunderbolt. But I typically use my tablet for taking pictures anyway. Video streaming (netflix, youtube) work well. I both read and listen to books and am pleased with the screen size and sound. I use Go apps for calling, texting, and contacts, and they work fine. All told, while I can relate to the frustration of the reviewers who gave the phone a 1 rating, your experience would very likely not be the same--but be ready for it just in case.REVISED:Now that the seller informed me that there are no led lights or camera flash on the phone (very odd for a smartphone) I'd like to change my rating to five stars. This phone is a very good deal--android 4, double sim, pretty good controls, nice weight and thickness. Worst feature is the camera and that's fine for quicky shots when quality isn't important.

I really liked the look of the large screen---it is like a combo phone/tablet.  I received this phone yesterday and am very disappointed.  Trying to do the simplest things are incredibly frustrating.  When I dial a number to make a call and the phone starts to connect, the screen goes completely black.  NOTHING will turn the screen back on until the call is disconnected.  But the real frustation is that I can't disconnect the call.  I've tried pushing all the buttons and even tried pressing the power button.  NOTHING will disconnect the call. This means that if I mistakenly dial a wrong number, I can't hang up.  The call goes thru and the person on the other end has to disconnect.  I am assuming this phone is defective, because otherwise this would be a seriously stupid design flaw.Also I tried logging into my Yahoo email account, but had the most frustrating time getting the phone to select the right letters/numbers to log in.  It repeatedly selected the wrong letters/numbers when I touched the screen.  I have pretty small fingers, so I would think it would be easier. I don't know how someone with larger hands could get it to select the right letters/numbers either.  The manual says you can use your thumbs to type, but it simply does not work correctly when I tried this. It types every other letter or number besides the one I want. Also, since I typed in the wrong login/password, Yahoo then wanted me to type a verification code.  When I tried to tap that small Verification Code box, it instead hightedlighted the \"login\" button.  So with no verifcation code, it tried to Login and of course, it does not work.  It then wipes out everything I had typed and I have to start all over.  I tried for a very long time last night and was never able to log in my email. FRUSTRATING!  The more expensive version of this phone comes with a stylus pen (I thought this one was supposed to as well), and believe me it is needed.I assumed that I needed to calibrate the screen to get it to work better.  The manual says to \"See Calibrator\".  However, there is no section in the manual about calibrating the screen.  I found a setting that appears to calibrate, however the only thing it said to do was lay the phone on a flat surface while the \"levels\" calibrate.  It did not tell me to tap the screen to calibrate the touch or the screen as other phones have done.Since this phone is so large, and does look a little stupid held up to your face, I assumed that it would have a speakerphone.  If it does, I can't find it.  Of course, my screen goes black when it dials calls.  Maybe if that didn't happen, I would see a selection for a speakerphone.The User's Manual is absolutely horrible.  It is obviously written by someone in which English is not their first language, so sometimes it just does not make sense.  In addition, the manual is very small.  One page has a list of Icons with a description of what they mean, but the icon in the book is so small, you can't even see what it is.There is no diagram with explanation of keys. For instance, under Making a Call, the manual says to end a call, press the \"Hang Up\" key.  However, there is no diagram to tell you which one is the Hang Up key.  I've tried the 3 keys across the bottom, the ones on the side and top and, as I said earlier, none of them will disconnect a call.Also, I had a REALLY hard time hearing the person on the other end of a call.  I pressed the toggle up button on the side but it did nothing for the sound.  Most phones show a volume slider so you can see if it is on the highest volume setting or not, but the screen stayed black, so I couldn't see if it thought it was increasing the volume or not. The manual says nothing about changing volume.I am currently trying to get a better manual.  Maybe there is a way to fix the above.  If I can't get a manual, this phone will be going back.Perhaps you get what you pay for and I will be forced to buy the more expensive version.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone at A Great Price", "Author": "Andre Sutherland \"suddy\"", "ReviewID": "R10894TGM7MSAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are few phones out there that offer the value that this phone does.

I am a software developer, I bought this phone because it has Android 4.0 and  I use it with prepaid T-mobile service. In this moment it is a pleasure to use it. It was way cheaper then Samsung, it is fast, it has a beautiful big screen, it is almost perfect.One potential problem I noticed is the low range Wi-Fi. The phone couldn't detect my router from 10 feet range, I had to enter ssid manually and it works now. Also the phone doesn't seem to detect many other routers around my house which I can see on my android tablet and also on windows laptop. The other problem is the battery time, I was surprised to notice that the battery was almost completely drained after 15 hours on standby mode. All services disabled (WiFi off, GPS off, screen off etc) and this phone can't even last 24 hours with a fully charged battery on standby mode (specification claims it should be 10 times that), a comparable Samsung phone can do this for 3-4 days.Overall, the pros (almost everything) well outweighs the cons (listed above).

I was never into buying phones from providers, getting ripped off in the process.  A lot of people don't realize usually people would be paying 1.5 to 2 times the actual amount of the phone just from signing up for a new contract, minimum data plans and what not.  A lot of people think they're getting a deal with those \"subsidized phones\", ha!  Lots of sheep out there I tell yah.  Never used Android phone before, but I'm very familiar with the platform since I do have it on my tablets.  So I knew what to expect.  The phone itself was, surprisingly, very well built.  Sure, it not made of polycarbonate or brushed aluminum like a lot of branded phone have.  But for the price, it was more than I expected it to be.  Plus I have dropped it a couple times already, my daughter even at one point threw it to the ground from about 4 feet high (mind you, I don't use any case or jacket), it only got a scratch and everything else still worked.  No cracked glass like some phones out there after dropping it just once.  OS is snappy and comes with a lot of usual bells and whistles.  I wasn't happy that the GPS does not work offline, something I might have misunderstood reading the description when I placed my order.  I used to like using my phone as my dedicated GPS unit as well, less clutter in the car.  And I'm not going to bother using data for my GPS.  But for how much I paid for it I was willing to forego that part.  Camera is so so, but I kinda expected that.  A couple cons though, the description stated it came with an analog tv feature, granted I can't use it around here, but the unit did not come with it.  You could see cleary in the picture the antennae at the bottom of the phone, mine didn't have that.  A little false advertising there.  And if I remember correctly, forgive me if I'm wrong, it also stated that it comes with a free case, again not on mine.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone, actually I did already.

And i am writing this review after placing an order for another one for my brother who wants it too.I was searching for a big screen android phone( not tablet anymore) when i saw this phone. i had my doubts about the quality when i saw the low price. To save time , this phone is a smaller samsung note 1 with a different name and a dual sim. My friends have the samsung note and i have used it too. I have no regret buying this phone and i have bought it again. Pictures on the screen are not as crisp as they are on the galaxy note, for the price difference i dont mind. it works so well in my country nigeria, only the tv won't work and i wouldnt bother.  The camera and flash works well but picture quality is not superb like the samsung.  Since you can access the android play store you have acces to the same applictions like any other android phone.  About the dual sim, this is your take home as it works so smart.you have the option of choosing a default sim to use for your voice calls, messaging, data connection or selecting which sim to use each time you want to call or send a message.  The data connection speed is very good.  I have a 32gb card on it and its running fine as i need a big memory for my movies.  You can use wi fi and wi fi hot spot and usb tethering.

I tend to hold on to gadgets for a long time as long as it serves a purpose.  But with the 2G phone it comes to a point where I am not getting signals in places where at one time I did get signals, talked to AT&T; people they are basically telling me my phone is getting too old to be supported by them since 4G/3G towers are replacing older towers.So here's what I was looking for to replace the old phone (love the older phone that has days of talk times and not have to charge everyday, but with smartphone nowadays being a mini-computer daily charge is almost expected):I want a GSM (so I can also use overseas), unlocked (prepaid seems to be the trend and I do believe it saves money), user replaceable battery ( I have a 4 year old IPOD that original battery finally lost charge and had to replace and APPLE wanted too much, I did find local battery store replaced for $45).  Also I want additional memory that can be added (16 to 32 gb SDHC card) so I can transfer most apps into it without worrying about running out of memory.As far as 4G, LTE, NFC all these latest and fastest stuff I really do not need.  I think today's BEST will always become next years second best.  In my opinion, I am not interested in chasing the latest and best in everything.  You get what you pay for and besides I DO NOT want contract phone (which is where you find the Fanciest BRAND NAME wares) but it will cost you $600-$700 if buying it outright or stretching over 18-24 months subsidized upfront by Carriers they will make you pay dearly on monthly payments.So about this phone and seller:Seller-- bought it from LOLBUY as mentioned by many others.  Absolute no brainer, the best service.  Took 10 calendar days to ship from Hong Kong.  No anxiety and no worry about buying overseas.  Came nicely packaged and contents as described by others.  Though I tried using the charger that came with it and found it does strange things to phone while charging, so I just used other standard mini USB chargers I have & worked like a charm.  And also because of less than $180, it really is not a risk to me, in fact, I am not even wasting money to insure this phone as compared to something that cost $6-700 bucks.Phone:  Basically a generic Samsung Note clone, per reviews here and Amazon.com.UK this model was rated quite high because of the value.  For $179 you get:Big 5\" screen which I do like but after using for a month, it is cumbersome to carry for a man.  I put it in a Reiko brand leather pouch and belt-looped it around waist.  But it is rather large to carry.  I suppose for women they can put in the purse and that might be better.  Though I love the 5 inch screen, everything is easy to read.  The trend with smartphone seems to be getting more toward \"Phablets\" territory.  Don't be surprised to see Samsung Note 3 going to be 6 inches.  Definitely getting harder to hold in one hand and swipe the screen at the same time.  Not to mention discharging phone quicker because big screen uses battery the most.Dual Sims:  It can be useful for those who carries 2 phones.  Or when I take this overseas, I can just put my US SIM into the second slot so I dont lose it and put the foreign Sim into the first slot to use while there.Carrier:  Being GSM means either AT&T; or TMobile or their various MVNO.  I chose Straight Talk pre-paid which in my area is AT&T.;  Funny thing is when I put the new SIM in together with my old SIM from my non smart phone using the N8000 in rural area I can get signal via the Straight Talk SIm but not my ATT SIM (as I mentioned before the 2G SIM is getting useless in many areas).  For $45/month I get unlimited voice, text and data (supposedly one gets toggled down after 2gb, but I do not even come close to that usage).3G \"H\" speed when available, sometimes can be \"Edge\" speed is acceptable for my use.  The \"H\" speed came closed to Wi-Fi download speed where the \"E\" speed can be slow.  But I use this phone primarily for voice calling, sometimes texts, occasional internet surf through the day.Battery:  came 2 in the box.  After the initial charge/discharge cycling, the battery life actually improves somewhat.  With Wi-Fi and data connection turned off, no Blue-tooth, just phone ON, it lasts good 8-10 hours with some to spare.  I only turned on WI-Fi and data connection when I needed them.  Initially I had left WI-Fi & data on and battery drains pretty fast.Voice call:  this is a little bit weak in volume.  If there are much background noise, I found using an earbud set plugged in is the best way to talk and listen.  If there aint much noise in background then phone is fine to hear through.Android: Ice cream version is pretty update and useable for the next couple years. I am sure Google will have newer version (K, L, M etc who knows?).  Considering there are still plenty Androids out there using ginger-bread,this one is quite update. Apps can be downloaded pretty quickly through Wi-Fi.Camera:  front and back but I always have a dedicated camera that shoots better picture/video when I travel, so this is just for everyday snapping away, not expecting super quality.  It does support Skype which is nice too.Overall quite please with this phone for its price, I think it is an excellent value.  Certainly cannot compete with IPhone 5, Nexus 4, Galaxy S3 etc on specs but it suits me well.  Some may think the plastic back is too flimsy but for a phone this size it is fairly lightweight.  I've popped the back open many times to put battery, SIM cards, SDHC card in and it snapped back solidly.  The smoke plastic back that snapped on the phone fits nicely and together with my Reiko leather case (Samsung Galaxy Note Pouch $2.30) it fits perfectly.  Screen protector that was already pre-installed temporary prevents phone from getting too scratched (it obviously does not have Gorilla glass) but I am looking for a more durable replacement screen protector.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "S.

I purchased unlocked in June, I highly recommend to avoid this device.  I am on my 3rd time sending it back due to a known device error in which you can not charge the device with the usb.  At this time I was fed up, my husband took over this device and headache from Sony and I purchased this phone due to customer reviews all over the internet, just not amazon.I purchased Saturday and received the phone last night, via prime.My husband and I decided to let our AT&T; contract go, due to the excessive fees just for having a smartphone, even if you barely use the data plan, which we don't because we rely on wi-fi the majority of the time.We decided Net10, which uses AT&T; lines.  I purchased the sim card (and Net10 comes with 3 different kinds which mirrors AT&T;, T-Mobile and one for the iPhone), then purchased the 50.00 prepay card.  I followed the directions, slipped the sim card in this phone, configured the APN settings and was up and going in 10 minutes on my home wi-fi.  Also, tested the connectivity of the phone and got 3G signal.I deleted the chinese apps, as it is not applicable to me.  Loaded my favorite apps, no issue.  Tested the phone for skype usage with my niece, comes through like a charm.  The rear camera is better than the front camera, but that is not an issue for me.  Configured all my email accounts, everything runs smooth.The size of the phone is large.  I have a kindle fire which is a bit larger but not really that much.The resolution on the screen is great.  This is a perfect knock off of the Galaxy Note in just about every aspect with the exception of the amole screen.  The OS is 4.1.1I am still reviewing much of the settings, etc., but you can not beat the price of this phone, period.  With many leaving contract plans due to over prices for the data, wanting a smartphone, going to a pay as you go plan, this phone will suit your needs in every way, especially your pocket.Lastly, the phone has duo sim slots.  This is GREAT because before my AT&T; is up tomorrow, I slipped the sim card in and used the android app copy2sim and downloaded my contacts from my AT&T; card to my phone, then took the AT&T; sim card out and copied the contacts to the Net10 sim, voila, up and running!!!1/31/13 - P.S. this phone is currently available from Sears, saw it online!!!

I purchased a t-mobile prepaid 30 buck 100 min / 5 GB data plan (from walmart) and a twenty dollar phone (also from walmart).  Activated the cheap phone and then swapped the sim card into this one.  Then transferred my previous verizon number to the new account.

It's already happened in major markets and is expected in my town this year.  Until then I am on 2G which is pretty slow for data. 2) this is a 3g phone so even when the upgrade is complete i will not be able to take advantage of 4g speeds.  It's worth it to me.

I'm not very smartphone literate, so it's taken some tinkering and googling.This seems like a substantial phone for the money and overall I'm happy with my purchase.  Only thing is I wasn't sure which sim card slot to use for TMobile service in the US.. instruction manual was no help...hence the Googling.  I've tried both sim card slots and unless I turn on TMobile data, the phone will give me message that I am out of 3G range.  I am in the city so I am definitely in 3G range.  What does turning on the data connection have to do with making a phone call?  And trying to download a 1.5MB app from the google app store didn't work.  Ended up having to use WIFI.Also, another reviewer said that their call volume was very loud.  Mine is very soft even with the call volume level set to Max.No analog TV channels in my area...I think all of U.S has upgraded to only digital. Haven't tried the camera yet. :)Update 2-1-2013:  TMobile somehow noticed that I was having trouble making phone calls and sent me an automatic app that set all of my phone settings for me.  Thought that was pretty amazing.  But unfortunately still can't get 3G data, only get Edge.  Went to TMobile store, one rep told me phone was GSM/GPRS (according to what was printed on front of User guide booklet) and that meant that phone was only 2G capable, but another TMobile rep told me that this (international) phone runs on 1900 mhz, and that TMobile has not finished upgrading LTE service here, and that by the end of March I should be able to get 3G on this phone.  They also told me that since this phone is a clone and also was not purchased or authorized by TMobile they really couldn't offer me any support for it.  So, it remains to be seen if I'll ever get 3G or not :(Update 5-10-2013: Still no 3G data.  I'd beware of this phone if you have TMobile.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than expected.", "Author": "Dex Rabe", "ReviewID": "RKWU1KN8K8AU0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone met all my expectations and more. Then again, I did not set a high one base on the reviews. The key reason I bought these phone is that I travel a lot country to country and the Dual SIM card will help hotswapping and potentially losing a SIM. And for that, this device is fantastic. No issues putting and recognizing a SIM Card from UAE and Afghanistan. As for the OS, this was my first official ICS cell. I have always used test ICS ROMs prior and with a dedicated, stable one I was able to truly experience the benefits. It is fast and full of features such as swipe capabilities to running apps. But what impressed me the most is the battery life. At first I was skeptical with this item because it came with two batteries; inferring that the battery life was disappointing. However, luckily, that is not the case. This phone had an amazing standby time. I had it sitting in my bag for 3 days without use or charge and it still had about 78% life left. I used it none-stop to play games and it lasted the entire day before needing a charge; which is amazing for having a 5inch screen. I have yet to depend or require the second battery pack. As for the analog tv receiver, I was not impressed. I was able to get a couple channels while in Afghanistan and none in Dubai but I did not get it for that. And when I did test the ability to watch, it was difficult to pickup a station indoors (as expected of course). It was too cold to be outside to test. But when I did pick up a channel or two, the station came in acceptably clear and the volume/sound was clear and loud. The antenna however feels flimsy and seems like it will break easily; I haven't used it enough to use it to the extent. The biggest disappointment, however, is the WiFi which I was hoping to rely on. At times it cannot pick up a signal that is full strength compared to the strength represented on my laptop. And when I am connected, it sometimes does not retain if I blackout my screen to save battery. I guess that may be a good thing so I am not running the WiFi constantly in the background, if we are talking about battery management. Another disappointment, which is not a big deal, is the camera. The software seems to make images darker than normal. It could be because I had it set to HDR mode but I haven't yet considered testing out other settings to see which is best. I am surprised and happy it has a panorama and HDR setting at all. Lastly, I was often spoken of as having a \"Big @$$ phone\" because many are not use to having a 5inch screen. This though is actually smaller, thinner, and sleeker than other 5inch devices such as the Dell Streak (AKA Dell Mini 5). It fits well in the hand and for the purpose I use it for it is perfect; taking notes in replacement of using paper and pen. It fits nicely in my pocket without giving an uncomfortable bulge or provide an obvious appearance. So it will depend all in all on one's expected use of this that will vary the ratings. For a phone with dual SIM capabilities and proper size for notetaking it is fine. For others, it is simply below standard.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "A well-priced knock-off of the Galaxy Note", "Author": "WAYNE WECHSLER", "ReviewID": "RYYDA2LOT9G7O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Looks and feels like a Note, but missing the punch of the amoled display.

At first things worked out okay.  Now I am having all kinds of problems with this phone.  I have never dropped or shattered the screen yet the digitizer on the phone is bad.  I have several dead spots on the touch screen.  Currently I can only text and take pictures when the phone is in Landscape mode.  NOT COOL!!! Also the phone will just randomly shut off and I have to reboot the system.  I will contact (LOL Buy) the seller to see what if anything can be done about this.  I will make a repost regarding the result of contacting the seller. I would say if you only plan on using this phone for one year then this might be the phone for you.  However if you would like it to last longer then that then I would look elsewhere.Dec 30, 2012I waited to write this review to see if the phone was good or not.  So far so good.  I only gave it 4 stars because the phone instruction manual is a joke.  Once you boot the phone up there are more icons that you will see than what is listed in the  manual.  I even tried to google to find out what some of the other icons meant-Nada!! No info about this phones icons.  I had to just keep messing around with the phone until I could figure it out on my own.  What's in the box: Two batteries, 1 phone case, one wall charger with a usb cord charger, on the phone itself is the clear screen protector and head phones. Durability: NO CRACKS.  I have a shell case on it that came in the box.  Service: I use T-mobile.  The Note 8000 is a 3g phone.  It says it on the box so I wasn't expecting 4g.  It works on T-Mobile's 4g network and uses 3g and edge.  The only problem that I had initially with dialing was that I needed to switch to the other sim slot.  Once I did that I've had no problem since.  I can't wait to use the TV when I travel out of country.  In US this feature is a no go but it's a big crowd pleaser when showing the phone to friends.  FYI: It is important to turn the phone off for at least 45 seconds everyday.  When I don't do this I notice the phone doesn't function as well.  Treat it like you would a mini computer because after all it basically is anyway.  Overall not a bad purchase. Accessories:I recommend trying online.  There are not that many for this phone.  Don't expect all Galaxy Note accessories to fit this phone-you will be disappointed.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Rather nice", "Author": "Dmitry Cheryasov", "ReviewID": "R4I42RK3HV6XO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone works well.

No problems with wi-fi, bluetooth, and USB interfaces, too.The screen is large, good for reading and browsing. It could have higher resolution, though. Viewing angles are good. The screen does not grease easily, and comes with a plastic protective layer pre-installed, which looks easy to replace in a case of scratches.The device is so large it's not easy to operate with just one thumb (e.g. in subway). OTOH typing on screen keyboard is simpler on a screen this large.The construction is not flimsy, but I don't think it would withstand falling on a concrete floor.

I got my phone in the mail today, November 3, which makes it just 5 days from Hong Kong to Massachusetts, USA! What can I say - this is some awesome seller who really cares about his business!Packaging: Packaged so well I had trouble opening the box! Taped all over, then bubble wrapped and taped again, and then you get to the real box with the phone inside.Inside the box: The phone, with screen protector already applied (you just have to peel off the top layer), 2 phone batteries, headphones (looks like there's a built-in microphone too, but I never use that stuff so I didn't check), a USB cable, an AC charger that uses that USB cable, a plastic case and even a mini stylus pen! I was surprised that there was no user's manual,  not that I need one, but just as a fact.Phone: solid 4 stars!Pros: Loved how thin and light it is. It is perfect even for my small hands! Android works flawlessly, and I just love its five virtual screens. The application store is great, as always. There are 2 slots for sim cards and one for a miniSD card. The phone max volume is very loud! I can hear it from 2 rooms away. WiFi gets an excellent signal, and browsing the web is really fast.

First off, the phone kept losing connection with the internet.  Calls kept getting dropped even when I was in a stationary position, as was the person I was talking to.  It was virtually impossible to maintain a connection when driving in my car.  It was difficult actually making a call with this phone while driving due to the multiple functions required.Daniel Chen was pleasant enough, but when I told him of my problems I got a response about the signal in my local area not being good vs the network provider.  Then when I mentioned wanting to return this phone, but going to try another provider first, I was informed to only try at&t; or net 10.  This was not specified under the description.  If it had been, I would never have purchased this phone.  Sadly, my phone & I have parted company, but the seller would not buy it back, so I caution those who consider buying this phone.  An area tech told me he had purchased a similar phone, and had similar problems with it.  His prognosis was that the phone did not completely pick up the frequencies in the U.S.  So again, sadly, I would not recommend this clone phone.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's not good", "Author": "mad as hell", "ReviewID": "R3HXP83QUC6XVI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The screen goes out and freezes up all the time and it was very slow with downloads,this phone is crap.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Only one sim card works but its ok i guess", "Author": "Dana N.", "ReviewID": "R3KLNAKUTV7HNB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Its actually okay all the features except only works with one sim card, my other sim card cannot make or receive any calls, so have to get one of the sim sides unlocked hope it will get done. i bought the phone for its dual sim capabilities, i hate logging around two phones , will update though.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Progressively disappointing..", "Author": "N.

Things hang all the time, transition from one app to the other takes forever.  Speed of the phone app during calls was just unbearable.  You didn't know if the call disconnected or was still on as it took a while for it to hang up.  Camera seemed to capture everything with a blue tint and low brightness.  Of course, the resolution is very poor.  Didn't connect via bluetooth to many of my peripheral devices.  The stylus was simply useless.. and that analog TV antenna which could have better served as a stylus is useless too especially if you are in areas that only service digital TV signals.

It was my escape from Sprint and their awful service in order for me to pay less money on my wireless plan.I am giving this product 2 stars. 1 star being terrible! A half star because you get an inexpensive Android device with Ice Cream Sandwich and another half star because of the 2 sim card slots giving me more flexibility.Pros:Shipping from Hong Kong took 3 days to get to me in Los Angeles. Came with 2 batteries and a screen protector already stuck on it.Runs Ice Cream Sandwich, so you get all the features that you would expect from that OS.2 SIM card slots. I can take advantage of T-Mobiles $30/ month plan for data and unlimited text. With those 100 minutes they throw in I shopped around and got a secondary SIM card for more, cheaper minutes. 2 SIM cards = 2 phone numbers.Huge screen.Totally unlocked! No bs software. Made for developers and hackers because you can really dig into the phones code if you wanted to.Cons:T-Mobile claims that this phone doesn't have 3G, so they dumbed it down to 2G \"EDGE\". Complete bs!The light sensor went wacky! Usually when you receive a call like I did on my previous HTV EVO 4G, the screen will go black once you put the phone up to your ear, then the screen will light back up when you take the phone away from your ear. Well, once I make or receive a phone call, the screen goes black and no amount of button pressing will get it back! The little sensor keeps flashing a red light at me, but it's barely noticeable. So that part is defective. It's annoying when I make a call because I can't use the screen to enter numbers if I have to call a company's automated system. AND if I call a friend and it goes to voicemail, I have to leave my message then tell them when it's over. Sit through the voice prompts telling me to press 1 or 2 for whatever and I cant hang up the phone!Stylus' aren't compatible. I trie using a Nintendo 3DS pen as well as other stylus' and none of them work.The antenna is useless in America. We use a digital tv signal here so the analog antenna receives nothing. AND if you wanna use the FM radio, you still have to plug in headphones.It has corrupted my mini sd card twice now. I think it's from dropping the phone. Even though this morning I dropped it on my carpet from about 2 feet high. I think that's what causes this problem.The phone is super slippery! You have to use 2 hands.The wifi is awful.The volume on the ear piece is super low.That's about it for now.This device makes for a great back up phone or a wanna be tablet.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not 3G", "Author": "R.

If you are worried about some compromises between this phone and the Samsung Note II, then here is a bit of a run down. First, the back of the phone is not as durable as it could be. Also the screen isn't Amolded or anything like that but it is still a fairly good quality. Second, I don't believe that it carries the same \"beam technology\" that you will find on the Samsung S3. The phone was under $200 bucks...big deal. Third, you will definitely want to buy a memory card because the memory on the hard drive is almost non-existent. The camera quality, especially the front facing camera is...well...its bad really bad compared to other phones I've had, but in the same breathe its not the absolute worst either. You will have to decided on that.All in all the phone was a wonderful buy, and if you use the right seller you will have an awesome experience and your wallet will thank you.

I bought it from LOLBUY and got it within 6 days! I've been experimenting with it all day today and I can honestly say that this phone is perfect (well for me anyway). I popped in the t-mobile prepaid $30 unlimited text and web sim card and it was working perfectly. Even though i do not actually receive 3g speed and i am always on edge its not really much of a problem for me because I'm constantly near WiFi all the time. Other than that there are only pros in regards to this phone, it runs really smoothly, the camera quality was actually perfect for me, and i made about 6 phone calls today and i had no problem whatsoever with the volume or the speakers. This phone is definitely one of the best purchases i have made. This phone was meant to be a Christmas present but now i don't want to give it up!*****Edit*****So the phone was working fine for a month or two. And now it has randomly refused to turn on after flashing me a white screen. It has been off for more than 26 hours!*****Edit*****againThe supplier I bought it from is supplying me with a new phone!

Couple things i noticed is when it's on the charger and you're  touching the screen doing anything, it goes a bit WAY TOO over sensitive so it clicks things or letters that you didn't and scrolls too quick... I tried to play with the sensitivity settings and it doesn't matter really it does the same thing when ON the charger. BUT off the charger it's just fine.- I went through ATT/Go Phone plan and it worked just fine, the only thing is even though my fiance had the SAME plan thru the SAME company and a different phone... his reception was MUCH better... which doesn't make too much sense but something to consider.- Another thing I noticed is the fact that this is a KNOCK OFF of the Samsung Galaxy NOTE I717/i9220. I know this because i do now have an authentic Samsung galaxy note ( NOT bought on amazon) and i compared them when i got it.- As far as cases, I could NOT find a case for this knock off phone because the dimensions on this knock off are smaller both height and width wise and the placement of the camera, mic, headphone jack etc are slightly moved around so trying to buy anything for it was impossible. I bought a hybrid case with kickstand that I thought would work but the knock off was too small. Now, that same phone case is FOR the Samsung Galaxy note, which fits snuggly and perfectly in every aspect for the Original phone. I would give the cases 0 out of 10.  (Also, If we're talking more comparisons, the Original phone has an \"S-pen\" for it.... the knock off has an Antenna which in my opinion is placed awkwardly and doesn't even work. They advertise that you can get basic channels but no matter where I went there was nothing around. So as far as \"free channels\"... I wouldnt count on it.)-The battery was alright for normal use but I found after about 2-3 months of regular normal use the battery life faded and I found myself always needing to charge it. They DO give you a second battery in the package BUT.... same result. So i'd give that a 5 out of 10.-The camera is surprisingly good-fair quality. Compared to the original, its about the same but not AS good. Still if you're looking for decent camera quality, it'd give it 7 out of 10.- Call quality is decent. (besides dropped calls mainly because the reception wasn't great) 7 out of 10-The screen quality and clarity is good as well. 8 of 10One thing I will touch on though and it's on both ends. The reason I had to get a new phone was because I dropped the phone flat ( accidentally) from a height of about a foot and a half maybe less and it COMPLETELY shot the phone. The Touch mechanism went out. I could turn it on, but no luck trying to get anything to work. Strangely enough, if i had it turned on or the battery just in the phone, the alarm would go off... but it's none that I set. Random times which was irritating so i just took the battery out. So I took the phone to a cell repair shop and they took it apart to see if maybe it's just a wiring problem and said the wiring is fine but twisted in a weird way. They couldn't find a physical reason why the touch went out but upon further inspection there is NO factory Reset button ANYWHERE and there is absolutely NO way to reset it if your touch goes out. It then becomes completely useless. The only thing i could recycle ( give to them to use again) on the phone was the battery. Otherwise they said there's nothing that can be done besides sending it back to the people I bought it from and although I considered it, I know it can be pricey and I am not willing to pay that or Wait because I needed a phone.- All in all, the phone is a good phone for functionality, calling, apps, downloading, internet and I know I didn't go through every single little detail about it, but please feel free to ask me questions because I remember better that way.  I personally would not buy this phone again purely because I found the original is sooo much better and you get what you pay for, basically. If it's something for a teen or starter smartphone and you don't want to pay BIG then I'd say it's okay but if you want the guarantee authenticity then it's not for you. Ultimately I recommend reading others reviews as well and make your own decisions.

The phone I received didn't have the TV antenna which is no big deal since I am in the US and we don't use analog TV here anymore. Also the phone ran Android 4.2 not 4.0 which is an upgrade so it was a plus.Now I researched this particular phone for weeks before I purchased it. I knew there was a risk but after reading many reviews I decided to click buy. What i received was not what i researched so I was a bit upset but the phone looked great so I tried it out for about a week.The phone itself looked very nice. It didn't feel or look cheap. The screen looks great and way better than expected. Andoid 4.2 ran flawlessly and never had any lag or freezing problems in the week I had it. I was really surprised on how great the phone ran since my expectations weren't very high. The resolution on the display was bright and sharp. Most apps worked fine.Now I will explain the bad and why I returned the phone. The camera. It's bad. I have always used my phones as my primary camera since it's always on me and I have 2 little ones so I am always snapping dozens of pictures per day. The back camera was OK in very good lighting but still one of the worst phone cameras Ive seen since having about 5 different smartphones in the past 5 years. The front facing camera was so bad it was totally not useable. I also couldn't get mms to work on the phone which could have been a service thing (straight talk.)  Some apps did not run well. Youtube streamed fine but netflix would not play videos. I couldn't video chat at all with any capable app. Now what was a main deal breaker for me was the earpiece was absolutely terrible.I could barely hear anybody at the highest volume setting and it sounded very staticy. It drove me crazy. Also the person on the other line couldn't hear me very clear.So all in all I think this is a decent chinese smartphone for what you pay for. Since I take lots of pictures and use my phone to actually make phone calls it did not work for.

His cell phone plan is talk and text only.  but when he is with me and my phone, I can hotspot him (giving him my data access).  I also like that Skype works on this phone too. Overall great phone.  I'm looking for a case, would be great if Amazon can get some cases for this phone.  The only down side I'm finding is that the speaker on the phone is not as loud as I would like, even when turned on to the max.  Speaker is fine for youtube videos, game and music sounds, but not for when I receive phone calls.  Which is fine, since I prefer using earphones when talking on the phone.  I've already recommended to my friends, and I will highly recommend to anyone who is looking for an affordable unlocked phone.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "What I hoped it would be!", "Author": "Chelsie", "ReviewID": "RUQW4NL8L9CCW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just recieved my phone by delivery today and let me tell you it was so unexpected!!

Schlecht", "ReviewID": "R37HPOKM0O2V5D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone has a big screen 5 inches also Android is not so far out of date like most US phones are.  I really don't get why the big companies lag so far behind.  Anyways, the phone has some good points and some bad points.  As all phones do this is no different.  I also have some unknown things if it is my phone or the services I use.  I use straight talk so it's one of the cheapest services.Pros:1. The phone comes unlocked so you can put it on any service.2. Those who like big phones like almost tablet size this is it.3. Comes with plugs for other countries besides United States mainly Asian plugs.I used these for places like Philippines.4. GSM phone so works on most anywhere except with the moron companies in United States like Sprint/Verizon.5. The clicking seems to work and the battery life even with this big of screen last one day.6. The phone is cheap and has a newer android.7. The phone is compatible with google marketplace and can load plenty of apps on it.8. Wifi works well9. Blu Tooth works as well.10. Typing is pretty good just as easy as other smartphones.11. 90% of the time no problems with anything but if you use phone as your lively hood this is not good enough.Cons:1. The phone doesn't pick up your voice unless your mouth is really close often causes hangup since android hangup is there.2. The phone's speaker is very low volume for the ear piece during a phone call, I always have it at max and still very difficult to hear.3. The phone has no way to update or root it unless you can read Chinese which is the native country. They say you can on internet nothing listed or sent to me works.4. The phone has a big problem which I don't know if this is Android fault or Phone.  When you receive a call the screen goes black.  Why?  I want to do something so I move my face away it doesn't get bright all the time it stays dark I don't have any screen, If I hit the screen it doesn't respond.  Yet other times it stays lit and I hangup on people cause mouth is next to hangup. Stupid design the hangup should be a slider to hangup your moron google.  Also it's front camera perhaps is the problem detecting light or dark since it is so poor.5. The phone is unlocked but not rooted so you can't get rid of 2 Chinese crap programs only disable them also you can't install programs I consider important like firewall/some full backup tools/anti-virus.Universal Grips:(Networks or Phones)The phone has TV ability yet this is pointless in the United States we don't use analogy anymore so radio would be better.The phone plug in for power often falls this is a common theme for mini-usb it's alot of phones.The phone sometimes must be restarted or network restarted sometimes to get internet reestablished especially if you have not done that in over 2 days.The phone also sounds like robot scrambles sometimes when answering.  I hangup and redial it works fine. That's been happening 1/10 phone calls.  Maybe NSA who knows.Cons for Android:1. The phone often hangs up since android is so dumb to put a hang up next to your cheek.  If you push your facenext to the phone to hear or speak into the mic it hangs up yet you must to hear.2. You need to design a slider for hangup also don't go dark when on phone call.3. When you put a lock on Android the phone starts up in the morning starts ticking why?  Why? WHY!!!I want to know why android makes a ticking sound after it boots and drains all my battery as it doesn't turn screenoff this is when you have your phone encrypted if you don't have it encrypted the phone just starts up in the morningand screen goes black yet it ticks like a stop watch on boot if encrypted.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "It dosent work and the Company wont send me a correct return mailing adress they keep sending me a China adress", "Author": "Philip Lovato", "ReviewID": "R24L6PSJY4RHDM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPS from two locations have told me that it will cost 150.to send back this phone that dose not work, this phone is not worth 150, my location is Denver CO.
