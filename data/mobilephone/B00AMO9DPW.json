Other than constantly freezing up, the charging port has stopped being able to work on any charger. We thought at first that the battery was the issue, but after spending $20+ dollars on a new battery, we found out that it was the port, itself, that was the problem. Whenever we try to connect it to a charger, its extremely loose. It wiggles around everywhere, and when you FINALLY get it to register as being connected, it'll say the battery is fully charged or for some reason says its at 14%. It'll stop charging itself in the middle of the night, and constantly go off and on saying \"connect to charger\" which in turn, wakes us up. I hate this phone and the lack of help we have recieved from Metro PCS, itself. We have had this phone for about 6 months. >:|", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Josee _268", "ReviewID": "R33VJKG4THMA6V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this phone from a best buy in April, and so far am very satisfied with it. Phone has a very elegant design and feels strongly built. Owned previous version admire and was very slow to respond and also while surfing the web, but 1 GHz and metro's new 4G LTE seems to fix that. Call quality is good and at a good price. Overall very satisfied with my Galaxy Admire.
