Melvin", "ReviewID": "R1Z65VU3LZCY2O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sadly, not even the phone seems to know.  Full disclosure: I was given this phone by my employer to use for official business.  I can only imagine it was purchased because it was affordable - and not because of any particular features/specs (sometimes my employer is a bit tech-slow).  This phone touts itself as a cell phone with walkman like sound built-in, so you can listen to music on the go.First - as far as sound is concerned - it actually isn't all that bad for a cell phone.  Whether you use the included headset, the internal speaker, or a nice pair of headsets (not that included is bad - but just not top-notch) - the music that comes from this device is pretty nice.  The only bad part is that if you use this thing like a MP3 player, you had better be prepared to have it hooked up to a charging device somewhere - as the battery is horrible.  Just sitting there, I get about 2 days out of this phone without a charge.  I attribute this to the background actions of Android more so than the battery itself.  This phone is power hungry and if you like to play music - kiss your phone calling ability goodbye.  On top of that - there isn't exactly a lot of room on this phone to store your music collection.  You can insert additional memory - but why bother when so many good MP3 players already have built-in memory and also have good battery life.  It does include the ability to digitally tune FM stations - which is actually a handy feature when you are out and about and the world is ending - best way to figure out which areas are hit hardest by zombies is to listen to the radio.  You're welcome!Now, back to the review.  This device is first and foremost a cell phone and in that regard it does an okay job.  Reception is fairly strong, even when other colleagues were having issues picking up a signal (same carrier).  Again, however, you are faced with the disappearing battery act - as in, it won't work when you actually need it.  If you charge nightly you may be okay - but who wants to charge their phone everyday?  I've had phones that lasted for 3-5 days without a charge, as long as I wasn't playing or surfing too much.  One other little tidbit that keeps this phone from achieving a higher rating - the mute button is right about where my cheek touches the phone.  Yep, not a fun phone call when you're saying something and the other person is screaming \"You there?!?!  Are you there?!??!  Did we get disconnected?\" all the while it is simply because your cheek hit the freaking mute button.  Bad layout, in my view.  Otherwise, sound quality is nice and according to people I talk to - my voice is nice also (this may or may not be them attempting to compliment me on having a sexy voice).  What is a cell phone if not able to transmit your voice from point to point.  Well, it is also a text machine - and this little guy makes it fairly easy (and I hate texting).  Held vertically, the phone has a smart keyboard that tries to figure out what you are typing (fairly accurate) - held horizontally, it gives you a full keyboard to avoid the random auto-text mistakes that can land you in the bosses office trying to explain why you want to do some rather foul things to him after the meeting (stupid auto-text...).  Anyway, I digress...Overall, Sony has tried to combine two very useful features into one package and while the attempt is appreciated, it fell a bit short.  The phone and the walkman feature are just - okay.  Camera and video - also okay.  Reception - really good.  Storage - lacking, but expandable.  Android - dated and no updates forthcoming from Sony it seems, but you still have the marketplace.  I finally gave this phone back to my employer, after convincing them to get me a phone that works longer than 2 days, as I am on call and would hate to have it die while I am out and about.  I will review the new phone they got me (why do they never ask me what I think may work) after playing with it for a while...stay tuned.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT CELLULAR SONY PHONE", "Author": "SOUPY", "ReviewID": "RF76NPLIF08BD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WORKS SUPER WITH MY ATT SERVICE.
