The Motorola set up for us with no problems. We inserted our sim cards and we were good to go.  We've had the phones for about 3 months now and have had no problems. A charged battery lasts sometimes up to 4 days. Texting is easy and the screen and keypad work well for people who need glasses. It goes online easily and quickly and games download with no problems.  Maybe we've been lucky, but so far this phone has out performed the Shadow hands down!", "Date": "November 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "unlocked cellphone", "Author": "Mikhail A.
