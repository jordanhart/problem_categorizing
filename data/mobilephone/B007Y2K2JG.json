Got it really fast and started using it immediately. Within a couple hours I realised there was something wrong with the camera (it just wouldn't come on gave error camera failed). Whenever it did come up the image looked weird (kinda pix elated for lack of a better word). Contacted the seller and had to return the item (communication with the seller was good through-they usually answer my messages quickly). After the return I was told I would get a brand new phone but to my surprise I got the same phone (shame on you seller). I sent the phone with a protective screen on it and that came back plus the IMEI number was the same (unless that's not a unique number as I thought). Was very disappointed with the seller as they told me they were sending a new phone and to my surprise the same problem occurred the first time I tried the camera. I think they did nothing to the phone (that's just my thought). I bought the phone in July so I have been without a phone (had to borrow my sister's phone) since I had to be re-sending the phone plus I didn't get my refund until September. I think it took that long though cause I had to be sending and re-sending the same phone twice to the seller.Don't think I'll buy from this seller again (very bad experience)", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$249.00", "Features": "Unlocked Samsung Galaxy S II LTE Skyrocket i727 Quad-band GSM\nSamsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket i727 smartphone\nUnlocked Samsung Galaxy S II LTE Skyrocket i727 Quad-band GSM Cell Phone -", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S II LTE Skyrocket i727 Quad-band GSM Cell Phone - Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Knmu-1JCL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007Y2K2JG"}}
