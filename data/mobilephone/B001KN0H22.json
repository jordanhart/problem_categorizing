So I had to use the screen to type out message which was fine but the keyboard was a selling point of the phone. The Operating System tends to have lots of lag and after owning it for about 6 months there we so many glitches on this phone It was nearly unusable. The features on it are neat which is the only reason why it got a 3 star rating but without them it would have taken an easy 1. I do not recommend this phone though because you can get better ones for less", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "DUD!", "Author": "Jeterra T Cooper", "ReviewID": "RXPRAW40LGCQJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you want to spend your money on something that doesn't work, is out dated and difficult to set up... this is the phone for you.
