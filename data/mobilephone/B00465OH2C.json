{"Reviews": [{"Title": "X-cellent!", "Author": "Axel", "ReviewID": "RH4175MQR1KG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I got so fed up of using my unimaginably horrid N97, I needed a cheap handset I knew would do the job, be easy to use, and have some cool little features that I could rely on, at least until I was able to buy my next new phone. This X2 fit the bill, with a great camera, radio with an internal antenna so I didn't need to connect a headset, bluetooth, extendable memory, and loads of games. It uses the aging but still classic and very reliable series 40 software, which I was glad to have as a sane and dependable replacement for the pyschotic series 60 software installed by Nokia in the N97. As a music phone, the handset also had a 3.mm jack for using proper headphones etc. The handset is brilliant, pretty light and small in the pocket, with just a touch of class added in with the stainless steal battery cover thrown in by Nokia. Battery life is just adequate, at about 2 days for a heavy user. Setting up my email was also quick and painless and the phone worked well out of the box. There are some neat little features to this handset that mean I might keep mine even after though I've now got an N8, which is a proper \"big boy\" phone. The handset has a \"torch light\" feature that works like a wonder, and the loudspeaker volume is pretty impressive, especially considering (1) Nokia continues the stupid, mental policy of sticking loudspeakers on the backs of phones..... (Arrrrrrrrrrrrghhhhh! I swear they're just mad over there) and (2) much more expensive handsets with speakers on the backs of the phone don't sound as clear (N8, for example. Sigh....)Some drawbacks to this little number though, are the fact that the phone doesn't have voice-activated dialing, which, given it's a non business phone, shouldn't be too much of a bother, although it's a very useful feature for all drivers. More troublesome though, was the tendancy of the phone to switch the camera on when I picked up a call even though it had been locked, and for button presses of the music keys on the side to activate music files spontaneously again depending on how the phone was held, and even when the keypad had been locked. The other problem with the phone was that, for some odd reason I shall perhaps never be able to fathom, I kept having to set up my email accounts ever so often as the information I had put into the phone would be erased. This proved to be a bit of a pain. As usual, Nokia's software proves to be their achilles heal, and their lack of attention to detail caused some problems here again.This phone comes in two colors. Initially I thought the blue, white and silver was the better version, but since having seen the black and red version, I've had to rethink that. The phone is light in the hand, but beware, if you're image conscious and in a corporate environment, this does look like a kid's phone, which it frankly is, at the price point and feature set. For all of that, this is great value for money, and provides a pretty attractive, pretty decent budget handset that will do the job nicely, thank you very much, without much fanfare. For something easy to use and dependable, you can't go wrong.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bonito telefono", "Author": "jesus trillo", "ReviewID": "R1EW298XBATCOC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "es Un telefono muy bonito y el material resistente solo que el sistema operativo es muy viejo, funciona bien aca en venezuela saludos", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Phone not new as advertised", "Author": "Jonathan Long", "ReviewID": "RM89G3U79Q6L6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone looks new, but shows calls in call history.
