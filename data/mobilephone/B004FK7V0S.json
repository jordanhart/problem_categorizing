I highly recommend getting a back up sim with all your contacts on it just in case.Besides those few issues, it's a great and beautiful phone and is quick to text. I love it andcan easily tolerate the issues.

Cool phone.  When you use it people notice because it is such an original design.  (main reason I like it)2. Awesome keypad.  It is perfect for a texter and the button size is great for someone that can't see all that well.3. Battery life. Lasts about two days of heavy(ish) use.  I have gotten 3 days out of it.Now let me go into the bad...1. Not exactly user friendly.  Slow to navigate and a little unwieldly.2.  Back cover doesn't want to stay on.  No matter how hard you try it won't stay on.  I can just pull it out of my pocket and the back will slide off.3.  Some weird HUGE glitch in there OS.  For some reason when the phone is on for more than 2 days without turning it off, it will basically become inoperable.  The camera won't work and you won't be able to call people.  You won't be able to push certain buttons or respond to texts.  If you try to shut it down to try to get it working again, it won't work.  You have to remove the back and pull out the battery.  THEN it takes about 5 minutes to start up to operable speeds. (has a weird glitch where it won't work smoothly for the first couple of minutes.)This is the SECOND phone to have this issue that I have owned.  I sent the first one back and the second came with the same issues.I wouldn't want someone like my daughter to be in a jam of some kind and then all of a sudden to wait five minutes to remove the battery and wait for it to restart.What if she needed to call 911?I would never recommend this product to anyone.

I have tmobile service already so I called them to see about getting the sidekick data plan. They told me that it was possible to have the service but I would have to break my blackberry contract and that would be a cost of $200 for an ETF. I decided not to go that route and will just use the phone as a text, mms, and phone call device. I see a few people said that they were not able to send and receive picture/video messages on the sidekicks because they have no data but I was able to do so with no issues even if I cannot go to a webpage on the phone. I think that the design and aesthetics of the phone is very appealing and I am glad I purchased. The phone looked brand new when I opened the package. I had the phone (no scratches), an operators manual, battery, data wire, earphones as well as a carrying pouch. I could not have asked for anything more and I will gladly do more business with this company if all of their interactions are this professional.**Edit 5/26/11I am reviewing the plan mainly because there is nothing wrong with the phone but a lot of mystique seems to be surrounding the infamous Sidekick service not being in effect any longer. So I finally got my phone 100% activated on a new prepaid phone number so I wouldn't have to keep changing my sim card back and forth with my blackberry when I want to use this phone. I called tech support and with the change of the APN in the system I have full 100% use of my device. I have my Facebook and twitter apps going and emails coming to the phone. I think the issues that come in to place with not having data on the phone is when you are using a sim card that is not Tmobile. As long as you are on the network and the service can be verified then you should have no issues with data being switched on at the 3G level. Otherwise, this phone works fantastic. The only gripe I have is that the battery power tends to drop a little more than I would like. It loses power now because I am always playing with the data on it, however before I hooked the phone up I charged it completely and never used it but when I tried to use it about three days later it was completely dead which means standby is incredibly low. Just something to consider. Otherwise there are no other issues with my device, I am completely satisfied.**Edit 6/2/11Okay, so it looks like the data is, indeed, gone from this device, never to return. With the data gone this phone is still a nice device to use, so the phone does not lose any stars but I am questioning Tmobile's motive in cutting off such a mass amount of their customers. If you are not into any data features then this is a nice device to use. If you are an internet creature, like myself, please look elsewhere.

Well I went on amazon and read some reviews about the different sidekicks and decided to buy one. I was very pleased with the phone and amazon. But unfortunatly the phone I bought is a 3g and t mobile is only running on a 4g network. So no internet available for this phone. So beware when you find a phone you want on amazon make sure you asked the dealer a few times if they can connect all the features the phone has available.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "SIDEKICK 2009 IN 2012", "Author": "rodriguezmartin", "ReviewID": "RYWCBSXR2FYYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i have a question does this get data like internet for tmobile service cause i have tmobile service and i know they shutdown the danger data network on it but im thinking if it will work still", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "WARNING WARRANTY IS NOT VALID", "Author": "Kate Head", "ReviewID": "R22KGU3NUX29YN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "One year warranty is worthless.

First, if the battery is taken out of the phone, it erases all of the contacts, messages, and pictures saved to the phone. Also, it is overly complicated considering what little it is capable of doing technologically. Its reception lacks terribly when compared to my iPhone 3GS, and it will not allow us to save new contact info to the SIM card; so then when the battery is removed, all the new contacts that were not saved to the SIM card are lost. Internal memory is 5 pictures worth, so you will need to purchase a micro sd memory card as well.
