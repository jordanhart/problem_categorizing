It's not an iPhone, of course, so don't expect too much, but as a basic text-and-talk smartphone (which I have not used for data yet), it's worth the $25-a-month plan.Be forewarned though: After the first phone arrived, I got it up and running with a phone call to AT+T (the SIM card is included in the purchase), but the battery discharged in less than 24 hours. Recharge, discharge, recharge, discharge ... it happened three more times in rapid succession and I realized the phone and/or battery were defective. Saw a review on another online retailer's site that indicated the identical problem with this model, so that confirmed it for me.Enter Amazon's customer service people, who are second to none and quickly resolved the issue by issuing a replacement/return. The replacement seems to work fine (so far). If you're looking to keep costs down with a pay-as-you-go cell that's used significantly more for texting than talking (the voice quality is just OK, not horrible, not great), consider this model.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "I'm on my third one - Buyer Beware.", "Author": "D. Davis", "ReviewID": "R1A3BY1E30IZLO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First I bought mine thru AT&T; because I was forced by AT&T; to replace my G2 Phone or I'd loose $220.00 of collected credits. They did give $20 off to anyone who was already an AT&T; Go Phone subscriber bringing the total cost to $129.99 + taxBut, here's the big BUT -- Don't buy your phone thru AT&T; because they have a $35.00 restocking charge irregardless of reason, even if you receive a defective phone. Buy thru Amazon, Costco, or anyone who has a fair replacement policy.Secondly:  This phone has a design flaw. Samsung technical admits it is very possible a batch could have problems. The problem with this Samsung Apppeal is the phone doesn't shut down even though it says \"Shutting Down\", so therefore the battery is being used while you sleep.  You can have your battery charged to 100% at 9:00 P.M. at night and by 9:00 A.M. in the morning the battery is almost dead with a 3% charge left on the phone.In the morning when you boot up the phone it gives a Warning Sign that the battery is critically exhausted.So this phone depletes the battery even while it is OFF and you are Asleep. Testing it further during day use, the battery also depletes faster than any other phone I ever owned.Other cons I found:  Finding a Flip Top case for this phone is next to impossible, and about 2 choices for a Pouch type. After a week of searching by size, we finally found one but had to stretch it to the hilt to make the phone fit.  Placing the case in the sun for a few hours helps in this process. Or if you have an old iRiver mp3 player it will stretch the case or pouch nicely to make the phone fit.The other aggravating thing are the lower buttons, (Home, Search, Return, etc) are not responsive to the 1sttouch. The same complaint I found on many sites which review phones.The phone is smaller (but fatter) than most so you will have smaller icons and print, but in all I don't use my phone for purposes other than making a phone call, so all the possibilities what this phone can do is a nice feature.  Well, I'm on my third phone because the battery situation is nuts. You'll have your phone longer on the charger than possible talk time which may be good to save on those minute usage charges.If I could do it over, I'd pick any of the other Go-Phones, I'd definitely stay away from this one, it's not worth the aggravation. This phone has only been out since July 15, 2012 while the other Go-Phones have been on the market for over a year with better reviews. What racket this phone could be, sell this phone and 3 returns at 35 bucks makes more money than selling just 1 Appeal.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice for the price!", "Author": "Sic'Em 2001", "ReviewID": "R287PBNL72SFV3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read so many reviews about this phone that reflect buyers who are probably never satisfied when they have to spend more than 1 cent.  For the money (I only had to pay $100), this phone delivers.  It's not flawless, and I agree with those who say the battery is not the greatest.  But unless you have to talk 24 hours a day, plug it in overnight and ignore those who are never satisfied with any purchase they make.  The i827 has many useful features very comparable (and often better) to more expensive phones.  However, don't buy a phone for $150, and then expect a 5 megapixel camera with flash, the latest version of android, and the highest resolution screen on the market--that's what the unsatisfied \"complainers\" always do.  If you want the best phone available, suck it up, and be ready to spend at least $500 dollars minimum.

On the most battery conserving settings and after doing 4 deep cycles of the battery, it will now hold a charge for 11 hrs before being below 20% battery.I contacted Samsung where I was told I had a defective battery and to contact the place of purchase. Samsung didn't have any replacement batteries for me to purchase, nor did they even offer to replace it had they had one. Amazon's customer service was GREAT! Although they didn't have any replacement batteries they found one for me at another online store and refunded me the cost of the replacement battery.

The appeal spawns processeslike rabbits and I have to shut them down in setup every time I turn the phone on to save my battery.  I think there is definitely a flaw in the OS or in the phone.  Not sure which, but I am tired of the extra battery.....just to be sure I have a charged cell phone.May have to go to another phone.  I do like what it has to offer...but not the battery issue.UPdate:  I bought a new battery for the Appeal.  It was not cheap around $20.  But it seems to have resolved all the problems with not charging etc.  You have to be careful if you buy a replacement battery.  They all say for the Appeal, but some of the samsung batteries are a little too large and do not fit in the case.  Especially the really cheap ones.  Anyway, I am back to loving my phone.  I also figured out how to save ringtones to the SD card using KIES the software on the Samsung phone.  If you create a ringtone folder on your sd card and then use KIES to put the files there, the phone will find them and you have the new tones.  Anyway, I am back to happy with my Appeal.I really like the features of this phone, but like some of the other reviewers, the battery didn't last. Here I am a month and 1/2 since I purchased it and the battery will not hold a charge.  Even when I charge it right before bed, when I wake up, it beeps that the batteryis dead..so I have to plug it in again.  I have ordered a new battery and we will see.  The screen is clear and sharp, the functions are really nice.  I just hope the new battery fixes the problem.One other thing.  Adding your own ringtones seems to be a problem.  I added them several times, and they stay until you shut your phone down and then they are gone.  There are plenty of ring tones that come with the phone.  But not how to keep the new tones.  I put it on the sd card.  I sent it via email I even used KIal, but no luck.

When you power it \"off\" at night, first thing in the AM the phone is dead. It apparently doesn't turn \"off,\" but instead depletes the battery. You can't turn it on before charging the battery at least 50%.

I've been using it ALOT and it still hasn't died, at this rate I have no doubt the ones who claim battery sucks they obviously play games, call people every 5 seconds, text non stop  no 10 second breaks.  So yes doing all that WILL KILL your phone in a heart beat.  This thing will last you  whole car trip and it will be fine.  If you call alot or play games every second in your life then yeah it might die sooner but over all just buy a charger for the car and your good.

I regret the purchase.  Pros:  it is a \"smart\" phone.  Has a querty keyboard.  It's a good size for carrying around in tactical pants, and using out of doors.  Great reception for western NY and most of the east coast, decent amount of data storage and apps, battery life ok, battery charges quickly (an hour).  Cons:  the querty keyboard is awful--small flat keys which make it almost impossible to use without a stylus.  I bought this phone because of the slide out querty keyboard and I don't use it.  Slider phone feature--awful.  The slider portion glides out too easily making the phone difficult to hold and operate with one hand.  While holding the phone in your left hand to use, the on/off button located on the right side, is difficult to use without the slider engaging.  The auto rotation does not always work.  Preset programs do not fit my need and cannot be removed.  A real bug for me is that answering a phone call is actually difficult--not intuitive and requires your full attention.  That goes for ending a call also.But my biggest gripe is AT&Ts; service.  The website for the AT&T; go phones is difficult to navigate, has limited payment options,  and for someone who is used to a no contract monthly Virgin Mobile Plan,  it's almost a burden to use.  Go phone payment plans require you to fund an account upfront for a set dollar amount.  My issue is you can't set up monthly automatic payments.  I've tried, for two months now.  Also, changing the data plan is awkward.I went with the AT&T; go phone plan because: 1.  AT&T; has a better service area in western NY than Virgin Mobile (number one reason). 2. My usage of voice minutes is generally under 100 minutes per month. 3. The go phone plan has unlimited text messaging and messages are delivered quickly.  4. I hate phone contracts.Conclusion:  I should have skipped the querty keyboard and bought a better smart phone.  Not sure AT&T; is offering a better go phone at this time.August 2013 update.  I'm ditching this phone and AT&T.;  The go-phone accounting system and usage billing system is not cost effective.  The phone is holding up to wear and tear--it's been dropped a few times, but as mentioned I don't use the query keyboard.  As an introduction to touch screen technology in a phone, there are better products out there and providers.

The screen kept freezing up, and when I touched the screen to open an app, a completely different app would open, so the first one went back. Received the 2nd Appeal in Early December, it worked good up until early June. Then call quality started to deteriorate. As time progressed into July, to a couple of days ago, there was more static, and calls would break up more regularly.Just out of curiosity, I put the AT&T; prepaid Sim card from my Galaxy Appeal into a T Mobile phone that I had, and the T Mobile phone was unlocked at the time I did this, and the call quality was fine, no issues, so the service from AT&T; was not the problem. I reset my Galaxy Appeal to see if that would help, that didn't improve the situation at all. I was up to date on software updates on the Appeal as well. As time progressed the call quality became so bad that I could no longer use this phone. Calls had constant hissing and were breaking up every few seconds. I couldn't deal with this phone anymore.Going back to earlier this year, before I started to have call quality issues with the phone before June of this year - the phone was good, and I would have given this phone a 3-3.5 star rating. I used the Appeal with a Plantronics Voyager Legend headset, and it connected easily to the headset, and was overall reliable with the Plantronics device. Sometimes the Appeal would disconnect randomly from the headset, but I was able to pair it again easily, so it was a slightly annoying at times.My cell phone usage is mostly talk - I easily go through 1500 minutes a month, a few text messages, and very little data usage, but I wanted to have at least some data to use such functions as the basic navigation and look up info a few times a month. As far as Battery Life, I agree with what people are saying here, it's one of the weakest points of this phone, I had to charge this phone daily.Now, talking about what the current and present situation is with this Galaxy Appeal, over the last few days, it has become impossible to use this phone anymore. 2 days ago I dropped At&T; prepaid GoPhone service, and went to AIO wireless (which runs on AT&T;'s network)and I bought a new phone through AIO at a great price, and call quality on this new AIO phone is like night and day - it's back to being clear and reliable. I know this review is supposed to focus on the Appeal, but I also wanted to include this latest information to show how I resolved the issue, and that the problem is not with AT&T;, or their network, customer service with AT&T; is really rock solid, they tried to help and I didn't want to leave them.My Appeal flaked out in less than a year, and I just didn't want to deal with it anymore. I could try to have it fixed, but it's over 6 months old now, so not sure how much Samsung would have stepped up to help me out. The big gripe I do have with AT&T; is their selection of prepaid phones is so limited, so buying a replacement phone with AT&T; was just something I didn't want to pursue.This phone is anything but appealing to me. For Samsung to name this phone a Galaxy is a joke (I could think of many other names I want to call this phone, Black Hole, Abyss, Meteor is a good name, because just like a meteor crashes into a surface, I bet others out there have wanted to throw this phone against a wall, or a hard cement floor).  Also, at the time I bought this phone late in 2012, to pay anything over $100 for this phone is too much money, especially since this phone is Gingerbread OS.And just to make sure I cover all bases in this review - so the readers of this review don't think I might have had something to do with neglecting this Appeal, and maybe that's why it stopped working - I never dropped this phone, it never fell off my desk or off a table, I never spilled anything on it, I never left the phone in the car to bake in the sun, I didn't leave it outside in extreme hot or cold weather, I didn't throw it against a wall (although the thought crossed my mind a few times), or drop it in the toilet, although this phone belongs there, because it's a complete POS. I put a screen protector on it, I bought a case for it, I did everything on my end to assure long term usage of this phone.If I didn't have a sense of ethics I'd try to sell this phone and at least get a few bucks back on it, but I don't want anyone else to go through the frustration I dealt with. It's really sad, buying a phone, that doesn't even last a year. The star rating shows 1 star, but if I could, I'd give this POS phone zero stars. Don't buy it, don't waste your time.

I've been going 2 days between charges with moderate use (several phone calls, some texts, facebook, e-mail, minor web browsing.)  All of my iphone friends need to charge every night.  That's just standard for a smartphone.This phone fits my needs perfectly.  The keys are small, but I'm an adult woman with average sized hands and I have no trouble with them.  The phone itself is small, which is a desirable feature in my book.  I also love that it had a VERY low SAR rating when compared to the iphone.The phone plan is unbeatable.  $50 for unlimited talk and text, and another $5 a month for 200MB data.  MUCH better than the $90 a month you'd pay for just 450 minutes a month on a standard smartphone data/text plan.  I'll never go over that, given there is wifi at work and home (and many other places, honestly.)  I'm not streaming movies on my phone, just using it for basic everyday needs/convenience.  I wish I had gone the smartphone route sooner now that I see how inexpensive and useful it really can be.There are only two things I'd tweak to make this phone perfect.  I'd give it a forward facing camera (for skype) and a slightly better camera for taking pictures.  But I love that it takes a microSD card, another huge plus over the iphone.I'll continue to update this review as time goes on, but so far, I have been extremely satisfied with this purchase and wish I had gotten a smartphone - specifically, on a GoPhone like this to get the great deal re: unlimited talk/text - a lot sooner.UPDATE:  After using the phone for about half a year, the OS slowed down considerably.  I took very very good care of the battery, and it still is working pretty well.... but the OS is so slow that even making a phone call is hard to do now.  Luckily a family member ended up with an iphone to pass down the line (and even luckier - I can keep the iphone on the go-phone plan, so it is cheap!)  - so I'm giving this phone to someone else (after re-initializing) to try to speed the OS up again.

It has been problematic so far and will probably be returned, especially now that I realize how much the negative reviews of this phone mirror my own experience after one week of use.I really wanted a phone with a sliding keyboard.  My last smartphone had a very solid keyboard with proper buttons.  This is more like a thin layer of plastic.  It's not much better than an on-screen keyboard in terms of being able to type accurately and quickly.All of the reviewers writing in about the bad battery life are nowhere near exaggerating.  I charged this phone this morning.  I used the phone to download an app and deposit a check.  Five hours later, the fully charged battery is under 30%.  I have all data syncing, email syncing etc turned off.  GPS is off.  The phone was in the same spot all day with the exception of a 20 minute drive to a store a few miles away, so it didn't need to search for satellites.The battery usage app tells me that 46% of the battery was used by the display (how? It was off all day?) and 26% was used by cell standby.I am also having problems receiving images in text messages.  Sometimes I can view the images, sometimes I can't.  I can download images, but when I try to open them, it plays a blank 5 second video clip instead.  If I browse to the saved location, it shows me the file name and a file size, but an error thumbnail instead of the image.This phone was made for people who have vision problems.  When I check my email in landscape mode, I can see TWO subject lines, in portrait mode, only five.  The font is huge and there's no way to change it.  It's kind of ridiculous.This phone also came with a ridiculous number of useless apps you can't uninstall.  I thought my last phone was bad, but it was nothing compared to the number of apps I can't get rid of on this phone (over a dozen, half of which auto run, which couldn't help the battery life).", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Ordered unlocked phone", "Author": "Robert J Kyle", "ReviewID": "R2U82133ZQRDYF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone came from Mango wireless LOCKED !!

I have owned mine for one year and have not had any problems with it. It is sturdy and has been dropped many times with no damage. I do have a hard plastic case for it. The limitations of this phone are as follows. It is android 2.3 and not officially upgradeable. 2.3 is a stable and functional version of android that runs most apps. It has only 512 mb of ram. If you run multiple apps you will be bumping up against the memory limit often. It has too many default apps that try to load in the background. This causes sluggishness and excessive battery drain. I solved it by installing an app called advanced task killer that I set to kill unwanted tasks and it also has a button to \"flush\" them. I noticed that the touch screen can be fussy sometimes. It is usually because the processor is still loading the page and won't allow input or it is because my fingers are too dry. Even though I have fat fingers I find that the keyboard is much better to use than the keypad. There are two voice programs Google voice and Vlingo which can be uses for handsfree dailing or internet search which is much faster than typing anyway. Google voice only allows about one sentence worth of input but I don't feel that is a limitation as it is otherwise pretty accurate when using it for texting. You need to use the voice icon on the keypad as the keyboard one will kick you out of the message program. The camera is pretty basic and has no flash. I tried to install several barcode scanners but could not get them to read the barcodes so this wouldn't work for that. The screen is small but since I am old and can't see anyway without glasses I opted to go for the smaller size to fit in my pocket. I can see it in brightly light rooms without glasses. In summary this is definitely not the best phone on the market. but for someone like me who loses or destroys electronic gadgets with impunity it is a sturdy cheap and functional entry to the smartphone world. I do not normally text nor do I have a facebook account but the phone has paid for itself just from the souplantation coupons that I have conjured up and is great for looking up restaurants and phone #. I also downloaded a gps program that works better than my $400 gps and lets you download topo maps directly from the map screen for when you go out of range.

I purchased expedited shipping and it said it would arrive within 2-8 days. I was hoping for sooner than later but I didn't get my new phone until the following MONDAY (day 8)! Yes, it was technically here within the parameters but come on, it came from Arizona (I am in Missouri), not Hong Kong. It could've easily been to me within 5 days. The phone itself is fine, in new condition. It's a pretty basic smartphone but being that it's a Samsung, I am hoping that it'll last me at least a year.
