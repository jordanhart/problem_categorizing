It came with a notice that any update of Android OS will reset the system to the original China setting as the phone come with custom ROM. Despite the custom ROM, there are still a few apps and settings which display chinese text. Can be annoying at first but after awhile, you get a hang of it especially when the browser defaults search engine to Baidu. Overall, the phone functions wells with the custom ROM. All the basic and important settings are available in English. A good option for anyone looking for a large screen dual SIM phone.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GVJHQX8"}}
