{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Maybe if you move to Europe??", "Author": "TIM ORROK", "ReviewID": "R1C7JLLLMQS07J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The LG  GT540  is pretty, light weight, and promises well.(1) My first concern ?  The plug-in charger  had two ROUND tines. It was for European use.I called J&R; who have promised to send me an adaptor.(2) I believe in reading manuals.  This one is titled \"Gula do Utilizador.\"  Pocket size, it has 100 pages in PORTUGUESE!  It also has 13 pages in English .  If you Google GT540,  you will get a very nice web-site (/uk/) with you-tube videos which show you how to take off the back, install your Sim card, your micro-SD card (not supplied, you need it for taking pictures), and the battery.  Press the \"On\" button.(3)Someplace (probably the video) it says the phone will wake up and present the \"Settings\" sub-screen for \"Languages\".  Mine just came up speaking  German.  It took me a while figure the German word for \"Settings.\"  I reset \"SPRACHE\" to English.  I began to feel pretty good. I like the look. I can read the icons,  activate the Wi-Fi.  But I wanted the phone to interface with my computer. Objectives: download the manual, and finish setting up. I plugged in the USB cable. Windows can't cope.(4) The LG web site advised me we needed USB drivers.  No big deal.  But telling the site I had a GT540 turned out to be a bear.  I had to \"select\" first my Provider. This is an \"Unlocked\" phone.  I try a few at random, including \"T-mobile\"  which is what I use. No \"provider\" includes a \"GT540\".  I then went to the LG/uk web site where I had watched the  video of the GT540.  I clicked \"support\" and to Downloads. What next?  \"GT540\"  does not exist.  The LG540  looks nice.  But I  can't make it work.
