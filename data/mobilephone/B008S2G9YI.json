{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Best of the Best for the price by far!", "Author": "Tony Jones \"mrkitchn\"", "ReviewID": "R1JN4BS55F97S1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading many reviews from various sources I was a little afraid of the Motorola Atrix HD. I will say it is the best phone I have had so far. I have always liked the Motorola quality and the picture and performance of this phone is outstanding. All my friends and family either have IPhones or Samsung's Galaxy. I bought this with ICS 4.0 on it for under $300 for another source and did the manual upgrade to Jelly Bean without a hitch. It was going to be several hundred dollars more to get either of the other phones and their screens don't even begin to compare. I am using it with the bring your own phone program from Straight Talk and couldn't be more pleased with the coverage and data speeds. All for $45 unlimited everything. The only negative is the rate it chews through the battery. Still playing with the power saving controls but enjoying the features so much I have decided to get a backup battery for those times I am away. I have decided on the Anker battery instead of the Motorola because of the capacity for the price. There are several videos and pages showing a battery swap from the Razor Maxx HD with approx. 3 times the storage but I am too afraid to open this sealed case up. Also got the Seidio active case from Amazon for this and love it. 5 STARS!!!!!", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Device...Once I Got One That Worked", "Author": "Lou", "ReviewID": "R3RMY16QQTYRR3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was pretty eager to get out of my increasingly expensive contract with Verizon. It took me awhile to make the leap because I have a strong preference for physical keyboards. Typos bug me and they're a lot harder to avoid when using a virtual keyboard (I think most people would agree). Unfortunately, Verizon seems to have the best selection of Androids with keyboards. I wanted a phone that stood a fighting chance of getting an official OS update at some point. Most of the sliders I saw on other carriers had processors that would not be able to support the newer operating systems (4.0 and up). I eventually resigned myself to the fact that I would have to get used to a virtual keyboard if I wanted to save some money.  A little background: I was with Verizon for 5 years. I loved their service, but I couldn't justify spending so much money every month for service that I could probably get elsewhere for much less. I love to tinker and I'm technically-proficient, which led me to seek out avenues that a lot of people won't bother with. A little over a year before I bought the Atrix, I bought an iPhone 4s and set it up so that it could be used on an AT&T; GoPhone plan. It worked out very well, with AT&T; service proving to be just as reliable as what I had with Verizon (I'm near Buffalo, NY, for what it's worth). I accepted that I would not be able to find a slider that fit my specifications and looked around for an AT&T; phone or something unlocked that I could use on AT&T.; I eventually narrowed it down to the HTC One X or the Atrix HD. It ended up being an easy decision: I didn't want a 16GB phone that I couldn't slip a memory card into, as I'd rather have my files backed up to something I have in my possession versus having them saved to the cloud. That was the clincher for me.  I appreciated the Atrix HD's relatively low price tag, considering its specs. It came with ICS, which is not yet necessarily a given with newer phones. It has a 1.5GHZ processor, which means it has the processing power for at least one more official OS update. Most of the sliders I researched had sub-1GHZ processors, which pretty much rules out the possibility of an official ICS update (the official OS requires about a 1GHZ processor to run). It has ample internal memory, but that's to be expected from most new phones that are made for post-paid use. It is a 4G phone, but I don't use the 4G (more on that later). It doesn't have NFC and, as a Motorola device, I get the feeling it will be awhile before it gets a Jellybean update, but it really isn't lacking anything that most people would expect from a newer Android phone. It does have its faults, but they're offset by its pros and price. The off-contract price for me was just over $400, including shipping and tax. My iPhone cost over $800 off-contract. I will note that I don't care for the camera, but I've yet to like any camera other than the one on my 4s. I've yet to use an 8MP camera on an Android device that doesn't disappoint. That said, the pictures are usually not hideous and using CamScanner to take tidier pictures is a workable solution for me. I'm also sort of down on the battery life, but the great-looking screen is the culprit and I know it. I rooted my phone and used RootDim to take it down a few extra notches, but the impact on battery life has not been apparent.  I've owned two of these phones, as the first unit was seemingly defective. I've used and fixed many phones, but I couldn't find a permanent fix for the first unit's misbehavior. It had a tendency to bootloop every few days, something I was always able to correct by connecting my phone to ADB on my computer and running logcats to pinpoint operational errors. Doing that is far from a 10-minute process and it became obvious to me that I was finding temporary fixes for a permanent problem. The phone would usually drop its wifi connection before beginning to bootloop so I had a feeling that nothing could fix that particular device. I emailed the seller (Wireless Experts, Inc.), explained my problem and that I was probably going to return the device for another one when I was done troubleshooting. They were great about it, even offering to extend the return period for me so I could finish trying to solve the problem. Ultimately, I exchanged the phone for another Atrix HD and that one is working just as it should. I definitely have to endorse Wireless Experts, Inc. for the way they handled my problem.  About 4G: I use this phone on a GoPhone plan and GoPhone does not support 4G as of right now (11/12). I have the 4G icon on my phone, but that's because AT&T; sort of renamed its 3G network-haha. I don't know how well it would perform or how the battery life would be impacted by 4G. What I can say for sure is that this phone is a bargain for my monthly fee of $45. I was paying about $120 for my Droid 3 on Verizon and this phone is a much better performer, with a much better (non-Pentile) display. It was a serious upgrade for me and it's a bargain as I'm using it, considering that I had enough disposable income at the time of purchase.  Great phone. Modern features (for November 2012). I'd recommend this phone and my seller to anyone who's on the market for a new phone.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "JersyMom", "ReviewID": "R14FHRBPTMFKFB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is excellent, love it, its tough , camera is great, Motorola service rocks no questions asked they exchange phones if your under warranty,", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Motorola ATRIX HD has Cyanogenmod 10.2 Pacman 4.3", "Author": "Wolf Tactical Blogs", "ReviewID": "R3ARPZFNWF8CCE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Thanks to my brother my new Motorola ATRIX HD has Cyanogenmod 10.2 Pacman 4.3 and Cyanogenmod 11 on it. The user interface is amazing smooth with all the options you want from your bloat Android distribution but with the ability to change simple options. Such as why would google maps need my call history ? No thanks disabled, why would Facebook need access to my sim contacts nope disabled. The endless options and freedom to change anything i want is refreshing.The updates boot animation is a lot of fun as well with the pacman game ,insert coin on boot. It really fun.Youtube works great and utilizes the small window. One thing that is broken is google voice working with the \"Pacman\" dialer to push phone calls. I am able receive Google voice calls but out going do not work.Edit: Using Cyanogenmod 11 Google Voice works for the push in the dialer to make calls via GV.I have not tested the HDMI output but should work well.Battery life with Cyanogenmod is great, Its another 25% more than the stock rom. I utilize the apps process minimizer which only allows  your selected amount of apps running. I only allow 4 apps at a time.Phone call quality is great over GSM and VOIP. Over GSM I only have issues in remote areas but once I return to civilization GSM is great. VOIP with Groove IP is ok, I will say that the voice quality may be from poor internet services and rationing from the service provider. Incoming calls with Groove IP are great and show up with the correct answer decline dialog.Photos are great!!! I love the ability to turn off or on the flash. As well the ability to use filters in the native app from PacMan.WIFI is outstanding I have yet to have an issue connecting to any network. As well with the drop down quick settings you can turn off wifi if you end up on a network you dont wish to be on.One thing that I really enjoy is the fact that all the inputs are on one side. The inputs allow you especially while driving to charge, connect to auxiliary, if you were a crazy nerd you could set up an hdmi monitor and watch movies through it.One thing I wish Motorola would have changed in the design is the non-removable battery. There is a mod but your risking loosing power at random. The issue could have been resolved with a removable panel to add a larger battery.Edit: Battery usage with TOR is a bit lacking. As it will drain the hell out of the battery and you will def need to plug your phone in.Onething I am loving about the plug locations is that everything plugs in from the top of the phone.HDMI Out: Using Cyanogenmod 11 HDMI out works great with Youtube with no lagging or issues. I am using a Insignia 32 Inch Tv from Best Buy that works great.Why I would suggest this phone, if you want something that will make calls, watch movies on a large flat screen,Use for a start up business with price lists or adds. This can solve your problems easily top not buy a stand alone system and just replicate your screen.Please ask me any questions via the comment bar or on my Wordpress Blog.Notes:[...]My Blog [...][...]", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Weak antenna and weak speaker compared to my old Motorola Defy.

I bought the phone for $49.99 with 2 yr contract through at&t; (actually through my local phone company that runs on at&t; network). It has great storage, I have a 32gb sd card that I don't think I've barely even touched. The camera takes great pictures I think, has a flash, pretty good battery compared with other android phones I've had in the past. I can go most of day with talking and texting and using the web without having to charge till evening. I love the HD cause it's good to watch videos on. I haven't had problems with it freezing up either which is a relief, bad experiences with other phones. Seems pretty durable, I've got a case on it, but I've dropped it so many times and haven't had any cracks and scratches. The first day I had it I was on the beach and had set it down in the sand and thought it was far enough that the water wouldn't reach it. I was wrong, it was submerged for probably only like 15-20 seconds, but it didn't seem to mess it up. I like that the screen is a little bigger. The only thing slightly negative I can say about it is if you use it when it's charging, the screen can go a little crazy.

I mainly used it for:Browsing the internetTaking photos/videosInstant messagingAs an alarmVery light calling and textingI was not a \"hardcore\" user of this phone, but I did use it a lot, and it always worked well for my purposes. It was fast and simple to use. One of my favorite features was the screen. It was bright and clear, and fingerprints wiped off extremely easily. Even after 14 months of use, the screen looked just as sleek and clean as when I first purchased the phone. The camera took very good pictures and videos as well.While this phone worked well for my needs, I did find 2 rather annoying things about it:1) The battery life is very poor. When I was on 3G or 4G, this phone would only last 4 hours when instant messaging (IMO messenger) was the only thing I would use it for. At home on Wi-Fi, it would last 5-6 hours doing the same thing. Anything heavier, such as watching videos or browsing web pages, would drain its battery depressingly quickly. I had to always remember to bring a charger with me wherever I went due to the phone's battery life.2) Email auto-checking does not work. When you set up an account through the Email app that is included with the phone, you have the option of selecting how frequently you want the app to check for new emails. However, it simply does not check for new emails. After some research, it appears that Gmail is the only provider for which the app auto-updates, but I do not use Gmail so I was out of luck. I am not a heavy email user so this did not affect me much, but this would be a nuisance for anyone who is.Regardless of the two downsides, I would still be using this phone today. Unfortunately, the phone experienced a hardware failure after 14 months (2 months after my warranty expired). The power button no longer registers. This means I cannot turn the phone on, so the phone is no longer usable. For anyone wondering, my phone has never been damaged or dropped. I experienced the hardware failure during the middle of using the phone.I contacted an AT&T; store near me to find out about having the phone repaired.

It broke down, so I filed a claim with asurion (phone insurance provider through at&t.; To my dismay, they sent me this phone.  The only thing that this phone has in common with my atrix 4g is the name. While it does have some advanced features that are an improvement, it is missing the #1 best feature of the atrix, which is the fingerprint lock. I had become accustomed to unlocking my phone without looking at it. Also the lapdock that I spent $400 on is now useless to me, as well as the cardock.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "Timothy Young", "ReviewID": "R31OEX00AJ328", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the phone was great but the charger doesn't work. what good is the phone with out the charger.

I'm sure he's dropped his old phone at least that far dozens of times with no damage whatsoever.  The screen is made of gorilla glass, which is supposed to make it very resistant to breakage.
