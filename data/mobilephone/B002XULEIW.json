{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Buyer beware: GPS offer is long expired, GPS is NOT included", "Author": "A mom and reader", "ReviewID": "RZL96JVYE5L9A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Please note that the 1-star review is for this particular listing (advertising that it includes \"1 year of GPS\"), NOT for the phone itself, nor for kajeet phone service, which we haven't yet had the chance to try.I bought this phone on Amazon instead of directly from kajeet despite a higher price tag because of the supposed \"1 year of GPS\" included with the phone.  Upon receiving the phone, I tried to activate it online and it did not appear to include GPS; I was merely offered the option to pay the usual charge for their monthly GPS service, but that was it. I then called to try to activate over the phone and was told that there was no such \"Safety Package\" and that kajeet doesn't even OFFER \"a year of GPS\"; rather, that GPS is (as described on the website) included in certain monthly plans or you can pay as you go (which is what their website indicates is ordinarily the case).  Even after checking with a supervisor, the rep didn't seem interested in sorting out why this was being sold on Amazon and just suggested that I contact the seller.Luckily, the customer service rep at Amazon was responsive and helpful.  She is following up on this for me & said she would have an answer for me in 3 to 5 days.  When I explained that I really needed to get this sorted out before that time because I'd promised my child a phone before the start of school, and that I'd really prefer to just go ahead & purchase a phone elsewhere, she immediately sent me a return authorization so that I could ship the phone back at no cost to myself.  She also said that to make up for the confusion, I'd be given a $25 promotional credit in case I chose to buy another phone through Amazon, or even to re-purchase this same one after the confusion is sorted out.UPDATE - two days later:  I ordered a replacement phone directly from kajeet instead. This morning, I got a call from a kajeet rep who explained that the GPS offer is a very old offer and that she doesn't know why anyone would be trying to sell it now, but that she's trying to straighten this out with Amazon and with Sanyo.  (After the initially helpful response from Amazon on Tuesday, I'm surprised that Amazon still has the phone listed this way two days later, but here it is.)  She apologized for the confusion & was calling to let me know that (per my request in an email I sent to kajeet Tues. complaining about the situation) they have upgraded the shipping on my replacement phone at no charge, and it should arrive today instead of in 3-5 business days.  This rep was much more helpful than the one I first spoke to and is making me feel a lot better about my decision to give kajeet a 2nd chance at our business.  Fingers crossed!  (TIP: Even if you order directly through kajeet, be sure to search the web for discount codes above & beyond what are offered on their site.  I was able to get this same phone in another color (my child's first choice) for 15% off the listed price (which is lower than the price now listed on amazon, no doubt partly because kajeet isn't claiming to bundle the phone with 12 mo. of GPS).", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$209.99", "Features": "Bar-shaped messaging phone with full QWERTY keyboard for use with Kajeet pay-as-you-go service\nSafety Pack Incudes 1 year of GPS Phone Locator service ($119.88 value)\nPay for just the minutes you use or choose monthly talk/text plans; convenient parental controls\n1.3 megapixel camera; Bluetooth for hands-free operation; Daily Access Charge applies only to pay as you go plans\nUp to 4.8 hours of talk time; includes handset, battery, charger, wired earbud headphones, operating instructions", "Name": "Sanyo 2700 Prepaid Phone for Kids with 1 Year of GPS, Blue (Kajeet)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XIwxflrFL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002XULEIW"}}
