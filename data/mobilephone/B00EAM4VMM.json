{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Mann A18 phone", "Author": "Dean A. Pullin", "ReviewID": "R35CW2I7C5ZF8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was skeptical about buying a phone with no reviews, but I did it anyway as it was the only phone that had what I wanted. It is rugged no doubt. I was looking for rugged, not just water resistant, but able to handle dropping with out worrying about breaking the glass. The call quality is good. I use it on my home wifi and it is faster than the 3g in my area. The cameras are ok, nothing to write home about, but they do take pretty good pictures. The camera just had to be ok not dsr good, but ok. I also bought this so that I didn't have to worry about all of the bloatware the telcos put on the locked phones you get from them. I have added aps and deleted them also with no problems. The one thing is finding a case to hold it. Alot of the ones that I saw barely fit it and then were either too tight to pull the phone out or too short to hold it in. I am still looking for that. The phone does meet all of the specs it listed so I have no complaints about it at this time. After I have had it for more than a month it may be a different story but for now it is working just like I wanted. When I was looking for a rugged phone there were others out there but they were $600 and up and usually running android 2.3. One thing I wanted was 4.0 which this phone has. It was one of the few to have it. I hope this helps. the web site does show a 1 year warranty on the phone but coming from China it took 3 weeks. So if you want it right away it won't happen.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Rugged Android Phone \"Mann A18\" - 4 Inch Screen, Snapdragon Dual Core Cpu, Ip68 Waterproof, Shockproof, Dustproof", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BQ2ywjAcL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EAM4VMM"}}
