{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrific Basic Phone", "Author": "Wendy G", "ReviewID": "R3NGAY9N06M14", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We were looking for an attractive, pre-paid cell phone and this fit the bill.  It's easy to use, has good battery life, and includes a serviceable camera.  The phone is comfortable to use (something that couldn't be said for the Motorola flip phones), snaps closed with a solid feel, and the menus are straightforward.  Call quality with AT&T; is very good.  There are two things that could be improved:  there should be a way to get photos off the phone without having to send a video text message, and it would be nice to be able to import phone numbers from a PC.  For the price though it's no big deal.  Other than those quibbles we're very happy with the phone.", "Date": "November 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Simple Phone", "Author": "S. Younger", "ReviewID": "R3HNRS04J3WAS3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for something simple that has great call quality this is the phone.  I researched low SAR (absorbed radiation) and this was the cheapest most simple phone available.  My other phone was ancient, so this feels like a huge step up.  Love the speakerphone, internal antenna.  The camera doesn't take super clear pictures, but my other phone didn't have a camera at all - so still a step up.  Overall pleased with how it functions and quality of calls.", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best for making and recieving calls but not for texting", "Author": "Christopher T.

But it works just fine, only been using it for a few days, long battery life. I just use it for the occasional call so I can't comment on the features.

Difficult to activate - had to call AT&T; when the online activation wouldn't work - took 20 minutes on the phone with a very friendly AT&T; associate to activate, mainly because I didn't save the plastic box it came in so didn't have the UPC number!  Texting is a nightmare with cheap keys and no Qwerty keyboard.  Menus are difficult to follow and aren't logical. I even found it difficult to answer when someone called.  Can't wait to get home to my iPhone...  BEst just to go to a store and buy one there already activated and ready to go.
