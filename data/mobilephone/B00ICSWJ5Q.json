I spent a lot of time looking at tech specs in reviews and what I've realized is for the average person, they are extraneous. So I'll avoid those and talk about the actual experience.SCREEN: If this isn't right, the internals don't matter. Fortunately, this is gorgeous. Like HDTVs, once you hit a certain pixel density, it all kind of looks the same. The pixel count here is high enough that you can't see any (i.e. \"retina\" quality) and the color reproduction is on point. Blacks look black, whites look white, etc... My wife has an iphone 5s and I can't tell a difference (honestly I feel the colors pop more on the Blu)UI: The Blu LPM is running Android 4.2 but you wouldn't know it. Nothing about the UI screams android- in fact the overlay has it operating more like iOS, which is very refreshing. It gives it some character and separates it from the sea of stock androids that are usually pretty lacking in soul. Transitions are smooth and operating the phone is incredibly intuitive. I had an xperia Z (returned b/c the 5 inch screen was just too unwieldy) briefly with 2 gigs of ram and I can't tell a speed difference at all. Google apps are nicely integrated and holding down on the home button takes you straight to Google NowCamera: This is an area most midranges skimp in and one I didn't expect much from. However, I am pleasantly surprised. The camera boots fast (you can go from locked to snapping a picture in approx 2 seconds by accessing it straight from the lock screen) and takes crisp pictures with accurate colors. The front camera is excellent as well, taking clear photos that manage to make great use of available light without looking grainy.Sample shots: [...]Battery: Absolutely beastly. I've been using the phone pretty well constantly since getting it so I'm unable to speak to daily usage but while using apps, surfing the web, or watching videos expect it to drain only 10% an hour AT MOST. Blu claims 36 hours of mixed use and I believe this phone could really go two days of normal use without needing a charge. An almost miraculous feat in the world of android (especially in the midrange!)**UPDATE**- After two weeks with this phone I'm consistently getting 2 full days of regular use (approx 1-2 hours of web a day coupled with light gaming and texting and occasionally some music) and the phone is typically still alive upwards of 40 hours after I've taken it off the chargerFeel: The phone is nicely curved and fits really well in hand. It is thin, reasonably light (although not a featherweight) and feels premium. It's always nice when something feels more expensive than it actually is (instead of the opposite) The buttons are placed well and I really like that it has capacitive buttons along the bottom. They are responsive and disappear nicely when not in use.Sound: Good grief this thing gets loud. It wouldn't matter if it didn't maintain clarity but it does. It is without a doubt the loudest/clearest smartphone speaker I've ever dealt with. You won't be disappointed here. The included headphones are also a nice surprise as they pack great mids and deep bass all with a flat cord that won't tangle.Gaming performance: This will run all of your basic games perfectly fine. I've even been able to try out some more intensive games (Riptide GP2) and it has run them without issue as well- even with the water drip effects and allfl. If you just play angry birds and flappy bird and whatever other avian gaming masterpieces come out- you'll absolutely be fine.Data Speed: I'm running this on T-Mobile and am consistently getting HSPA + speeds. That basically means its fast and pages load nearly instantly. The lack of LTE is really not a huge loss in my opinion. I can stream music and watch videos without any hitches, at some point the extra speed is just that- extra. The Blu LPM is fast, and that's all that really matters.Extras! Blu is going to do well as a company because they give you more than you expect. Included with the phone are a screen protector, clear shell, and a nice pair of headphones with a flat cord and volume control. It's a nice touch.Overall: I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better phone even upwards of $100 of the Blu LPM's $220-ish price tag. It's got a lot of character, looks great/feels great, has plenty of memory, an outstanding battery life, and two great cameras.**Also, in doing research before buying this phone I found out that Blu is based out of Florida-another plus! support this American company!**", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best of the mid range", "Author": "Alex Fagan", "ReviewID": "R3PFTV93W0WEAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most budget friendly phones have to sacrifice somewhere.

Nam \"FatherOf3\"", "ReviewID": "RXSDKNCTL09LS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is just like an iPhone 5 but with a 4.5\" screen.  It has quad core so it's really fast.  I bought a LG E960 with 4.7\" screen with quad core and it's as quick and screen looks as good.  It feels good in your hand and the battery life is crazy good.  I watched youtube and played games on it all day and after about 8 hrs, it's still 40%.  With my other phones, after 4-5 hrs of youtube, it's already chirping.  Only thing I'm hating about this phone so far is that they don't have any good cases for it....ones that I can put up with cost 2-3 times as much as similar ones for other popular phones.  Quality product and I was able to catch it on sale (under $150).  I love this phone!!03/06/14  I have had this phone for about a week now and it is a fantastic phone!  The battery life is beyond good.  Other reviewer said this phone does not work on T-Mobile...it does..make sure you buy the American version which is L220A if you wanna get 4g speed on T-Mobile....if you get the L220I (International), it is missing the 1900 mhz and you'll only get 2g (Edge) speed.  You do get 2100 mhz with international and it is needed if you want to get any cell service in South Korea or Japan.  The call quality is great.  This phone, like many Android phones except Motorola phones have hard time getting group chatting when mixed with iphone users.  I got around it by installing Go SMS Pro (free) and enabling group chatting under MMS.  Screen quality is better than iPhone 5.  Only few things I wish this phone had....slot for Micro SD card....and some good quality cases that does not cost $20+.  I forgot to remove the sticker in the rear and thought the speakers were horrible.  I removed the sticker that was blocking the speaker and IT IS loud...even on lowest setting...turn off the volume strengthen part under DTS effect on music player to be able to turn the volumn low enough.  I would love to try out the Blu Life Pure 5\" screen since that is this phone plus more!!  If I find anything more negtive about this phone, I'll update this reveiw.  I'm glad I got this phone instead of another Motorola Moto G.03/08/14  The phone is still great but I have installed an outside live wallpaper and it caused a little bit of a hichup.  I had several apps open and was running the live wallpaper in the background and it made the phone lag a bit and I had to hold down power button to make it restart.  I did have too many apps open and I guess it was little too much since this phone only has 1 gb of RAM.  I learned that you have to hold down power and volumn button down at the same time to take screen shots.  So far so good.  If I come up with anything else, I'll post.03/12/14  So far still no decent cases for these great phones.  I forgot to mention that the earphones that come with these phones are really high quality!  I used the navigation for the first time today and it took little longer than I'm used to before it locked on to satellites.  Before I arrived at my destination, it showed me going down the side road when I was actually on the freeway.  It caught up soon and made the corrections but I'm pretty sure the satellite connection was the problem.  Not sure if it was just a bad day or if it acts up all the time.  It did get me to my destination.  If you are constantly using your navigation, you might want to wait for a further review for this phones.  Other than that, so far so great!  I like this phone better than the Motorola Moto G and LG Optimus E970.  Camera quality is also very nice!!  Front camera isn't anything to brag about but the rear facing camera does awesome even under low light and it takes quick snap multi shots too.  It takes like 5 shots in 1 second if you press and hold the button down.  I'll keep you guys updated if I find something else.04/10/14  My GPS works pretty good now...must have been the cloud cover that caused issues earlier.  If you want to take a screen shot, press power and volume down button at the same time (or power button slightly sooner).  My phone froze couple of times when I tried to watch web embedded video and had to reboot by pressing down on the power button for about 20 seconds.  This phone still works great and I am impressed by build quality.  Battery life on this phone is so good that I couldn't go back to any other phone that can't last at least 6-7 hours of watching Youtube without charging.04/12/14  I'm beginning to find some decent cases for these phones.  I found some on aliexpress.com if that helps.  I have yet to charge my phone during the day.  I was worried that charging port might not hold up very well since I've had problems with them before with cheaper phones and tablets, where the charger seems to stop fitting tight after a while.  I don't have problems with the charging port yet...just remember to insert them backwards compared to Samsung products.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "GPS searching is very bad", "Author": "JIAYJKMBB", "ReviewID": "R14OTUKQENDWSL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everytime I opened google map\uff0c it takes me 20mins to located my position.Except GPS everything is great.

At first I was so happy to find a decent specced phone with a long, I mean long lasting battery! All was well until I tried to use the navigation.

I can only complain about small issues, everything else is fantastic.THE EXCEPTIONS:- Minimum volume on the speaker is TOO LOUD.  If you're used to watching videos at night, in a quiet space, say goodbye to that as the minimum volume for all media is extremely loud.  It's great that it can get as loud as it does, but the minimum volume is just insane.- The back is very matte/slippy, so the phone has the constant feeling that it could fall out of your hands.  No \"sticky\" type back texture like I was used to with Motorola phones.- Camera.  The Camera is raised above the rest of the phone, so every time you place the phone on it's back (without a case) it scratches the camera lens.  My camera is now fairly blurry and rough, after only a month of usage.

Yes the build quality is great. But the power button for my phone atleast is a bit stiff and will only turn on the screen if i click on the left side. Also loved the screen but the physical touch buttons were unresponsive at times. The ui is really laggy too. and for a long time android user i dont even think i could get used to it. A major complaint is that if i was sending text messages after a certain amount it would just say messaging is sending too many messages (paraphrasing). it was just bad. also with the themes. if you are going to have themes be consistent with the icons. i downloaded several apps and it was just their normal play store icon. not even a color background like it does for some.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Blu hits home run with the Life Pure Mini", "Author": "C.

Given the price, I'd say it's a contender for the perfect mid-level device for those looking for something reliable and functional.  The feature that really puts it over the top is the battery.  The battery charge capacity is huge and provides this phone with multi-day run time.The other nice thing about this phone, is out of the box it is configured in a very lightweight manner.  It's not loaded down with bloatware and a ton of apps that you'll never use.  It has all the essentials with the option to install more if needed/desired.  While it does ship with Android 4.2.1 (Jelly Bean), Blu has indicated that they plan to roll out an update to Android 4.4 (Kit Kat) later in the spring.The 4.5\" screen is really a pretty comfortable (dare I say, ideal?) size and fits into pockets with ease.It also works flawlessly with an H2O Micro-Sim card of your choice.The bottom line--I'd say it's tough to go wrong with this phone at its current price point.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "life pure mini", "Author": "kenneth howard", "ReviewID": "RMYUSVVQT5OOQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am really pleased at the highend features that the phone offers like gesture controls, medtek 1.5ghzs quad core processor it is not a snapdragon processor but it gets the job done.

I was sceptical of buying a phone I hadn't really heard of but the more I researched I got a little more comfortable with maybe buying it. I originally wanted an iPhone but being on NET10 for phone company I couldn't afford $600+ for a unlocked iphone. I decided to get this one and I'm very pleased. If your using regular social apps like Facebook, instagram and snapchat throughout the day with regular gaming activity this phone will do it with more than enough processing power to spare. The battery is AWESOME. This phone has a feature to turn on and off with a scheduled time to you preference. My phone turns on at 6:30 AM every morning and shuts off at 11:45 PM every night with about 20-25% batt life left. Its never frozen up on me and I've had this phone for 3 months now and I've purposely pushed it to see what it does and it hasn't let me down yet. I recommend this company and phone to anyone who wants a affordable smartphone with quality build, good processor and is unlocked for any phone company! However this phone is only 3G which to be honest is actually not bad as it sounds unless you compare it to LTE which makes this look slow. Even with 3G you get minimal lag and I haven't noticed it at all even when watching YouTube off my data. I give 4.8 stars due to no LTE or 4G and its hard to get accessories to this phone so i tend to baby it even though ive dropped it more than once from hip level and its held up just fine.", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Rosa Isela Ramos Galvis", "ReviewID": "R3CYVOG2S5KK4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the phone is great.
