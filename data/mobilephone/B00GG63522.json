OS is version 4.4.2 (so theoretically the previous camera bug is fixed), restarting the device and tried other camera apps but the problems persists. It can stay in this state for hours. My hope is to be a software problem.Previously I've owned a Nexus S and a Galaxy Nexus and never had any problem with these.Otherwise the device is good, screen is big and have nice colors, very fast. Battery life is par with my previous Galaxy.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "big bang for the buck.", "Author": "Anthony B.

At half the price of an iPhone it's a great alternative and a good way of getting into our android without the bloat. No replaceable battery or memory add on makes for a compact phone. Try it still has a decent screen size and your virtually guaranteed the latest updates when they arrive. I picked up the international version and I'm using AT&T; when in the US. I can only access 3G/HSPA but that's plenty quick for me and when I'm in Europe I get all the frequencies.

I loved it. It is very fast, the battery is \"ok\" and the screen is gorgeous. By the way, if you live in Brazil this is the right model for you, the D821 it is the \"international model\" that was approved by Anatel and supports our 4G connection. If you're reading it after April 2014 maybe it could be a great idea to read about the OnePlus One, this is another phone that seems amazing and it is cheaper than the Nexus. I bought the Nexus 5 on March but if I was looking for a phone today I think that I would go after the One.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone, best android ever.", "Author": "Rodrigo S.", "ReviewID": "R1ZPIWW7XXTHR8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very nice phone, battery life is a little bit under the expectation. all in all, is the best android phone ever.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Ferrari in a fragile package", "Author": "Mauricio Suguihura", "ReviewID": "R3PPOJKAG8K6YE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nexus 5 is a beast of a smartphone, perfect in almost every sense.Having the latest android helps a lot, specially when the camera hardware is not top notch.The exterior is a bit flimsy for a flagship phone, but that can be fixed with an add'l cover.I got the package on time and had no issues with the vendor (although the USPS tracking is far from precise).", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "very good device", "Author": "J.
