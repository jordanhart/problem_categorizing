Thank you.I've seen this phone for alot more money,  Great price.I've had the smartphones.....tired of the crazy phone bill, with this that and the next thing adding up!!This is a great phone and I won't have the crazy phone bill.  Easy to set up and AT&T; did the rest.You can get messenging and e-mail, but not for me.  All I do is make phone calls and use the bluetooth when I'm in the car.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, basic phone", "Author": "John from OC \"Mustanggamer\"", "ReviewID": "RZXKVUD25X705", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally bought a Samsung Galaxy 2 for my wife with all the bells and whistles and $25 data plan. For the last 6 months of owning the Galaxy, my wife used a total of zero data. She just wants a phone to call people, not use it to look up Facebook. So, we bought this phone and got rid of the data plan. It's only been a few weeks, but the phone has been working great and the call quality is superb. It was easy to set up as the only thing we did was take out the sim card from the Galaxy and put it into the A777. That was it and the phone recognized the sim card right away.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT basic phone - STURDY", "Author": "AnniebanannieSJC", "ReviewID": "RG4UAU11ST3ME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great \"basic\" phone - Other basic flip phones always broke at the hinge after about a year and were made of cheap plastic. This phone is made of substantial materials and the slide design is very sturdy, plus helps protect the keyboard. I also like how the slide feature elongates the phone, so the mouthpiece is down by my mouth - don't feel like I need to remove the phone from my ear in order to talk into the microphone.  And even though it's \"basic\" by today's standards, it has a GPS feature that serves as a 411 or map directions. Nice big screen, easy to view, has the basic camera... Sound is great and speaker feature very loud and clear. Great product, especially for the price. I took it for a swim with me, so I'm having to replace it and thankful I found it on Amazon, because the stores claim these basic phones aren't available anymore. I got the BLACK Samsung A777...the red amsung A777 is labeled as \"unlocked phone\" and was concerned this meant it was used.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "great basic phone", "Author": "Paul Mazzariello", "ReviewID": "R2BNP3P5WWZPZ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this model phone for 3.5 yrs,finally the screen went,all squiggly lines so i cant access any features,cant text,cant see contacts.Recently dropped the insurance but I like this phone so much i just bought a replacement here on Amazon.If u want a good basic phone,i'd def.recommend this one.", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung A777 Phone", "Author": "onecent6", "ReviewID": "R33TZRI2E1V7EU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I replaced a prior A777 phone that had Kool-Aid spilled on it.

After charging all night, I have to charge it at noon time and  as soon as I arrive at home in the evening. I have had three  of the very same models and my partner uses the same model. This is the first time I have had a problem with maintaining battery power and my partner does not have the power issue with the same model. I have returned the phone and the replacement had the same battery issue. It costs to much to keep returning the phone when all I wanted was a basic phone which I could use for  phone calls. I will just write this one off and look for a replacement.

But it is dominated by AT&T; stuff.  I don't use AT&T; because it's not available locally.  I thought the phone would be marked with AT&T; and have a few AT&T; things perhaps.  But all the major functions are limited to AT&T...; All of them.  Even the email works only for AT&T.;  I have to handle my email carefully.  The phone should not be sold to anyone not using AT&T.;  And the technology is weak.  The recharge plug is awkward to use, and confused with another, similar input.  And the phone frequently goes to a white screen until you remove the battery for a few seconds.  Again, awkward.
