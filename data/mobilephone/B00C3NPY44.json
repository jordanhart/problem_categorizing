{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Phone is very good looking, functional. Slightly misleading memory spec.", "Author": "Steven A. Hanifl \"stahs\"", "ReviewID": "R1XVIP2CPTJ9HC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am enjoying this phone very much. To pay under 200 dollars for a Re-branded One X is quite a nice treat. A word about the 16 GB memory on the phone... Only 2 GB is available for apps! While this is not a small amount compared to many mid or low range phones, I was quite surprised that this was the case here.... 9 GB was available on a separate partition of the same memory, so frankly HTC was just underestimating power users' demand.That said,  App2Sd simplifies the process of moving many apps to the other partition, and I have yet to run out of space. The screen is a beauty, and this phone is a runway model in terms of looks, it is beautiful yet refined. The kickstand should be a standard feature on all phones, it is very handy. The memory card slot can actually take certain makes of 64 GB sdhc cards so do a search.The battery is average, and cannot be removed. However, aggressive power management sorts this out... Provided you are careful about the apps you install, for instance Skype is notorious for halving battery time. If you actually let the battery trickle charge from 85 percent to 100 you will see an overall increase in battery capacity after a few charges.The 4.7 inch screen is great to type on and looks gorgeous, in public this phone doubles your wow factor. The wifi is dual band, 5ghz has good range, and the phone does a good job for a phone of holding signal, and negotiation for bit rate. Since phones are limited by their size I suspect wifi signal will always be more problematic than tablets or laptops... This phone does well for its form factor.I have been pleasantly surprised by this phone, This was going to be a stopgap phone as I tried out Ting, I will probably not upgrade as soon as I had planned, I have no need.Two updates in the comments section.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone", "Author": "Zakary Goodmanson", "ReviewID": "R1F5BH8XWSYX5S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone runs well and has had no issues so far.

I have had this phone for about 2.5 months.First, the summary- this phone is pretty great (for the price it is excellent). I switched from a Galaxy Aviator/Surge from US Cellular to this phone on Ting. I bought refurbished, so my price was closer to $125.The good: This phone is much larger than it feels- I hate the handfeel of the GS3/GS4- while this phone is not that large, the screen is very sizable but the phone still fits comfortably in the hand or pocket.Bloatware is at a minimum. HTC Sense reminds me of the ASUS Transformer UI for Android ICS- very clean and functional with nice polish.Processor is plenty snappy. Apps that hang or crash on my Transformer (Neverball, Vice City, FF6) all work great. I have also not yet needed to do any sort of task killing, even after leaving my phone on all week.The screen is gorgeous and ultra responsive, even with a screen protector.The phone has a rear speaker (Urgh), but the kickstand is very helpful for that. Sound is AMAZING on an external speaker or headphones (thank you Beats Audio).Battery life is decent. I am getting 2 days of regular use on one full charge. Though the battery is built in, it CAN be removed. It just takes more work.Camera is fast and takes good pictures. The video quality and sound are much more impressive. Comparing to my wife's Photon Q I really prefer my camera.The bad: The capacitive buttons are too sensitive and too close to the screen. I am constantly brushing the home button with the side of my thumb when using my phone on portrait mode.No HDMI port- every other smart device on my house has a micro hdmi jack so I refuse to purchase an HTC link. This would be a non issue except I have seen this phone advertised as having HDMI out support (referring, it turns out, to HTC link).No GPS on/off slider in settings. Annoying for the frequent geocacherbwho wants to conserve battery life. I am sure I could find a widget to do this, but that kind of defeats the battery saving purpose.Tinny speaker. Again, the kickstand helps, but the sound/volume is the same underwhelming experience you have come to accept with smart phones.The Micro USB jack is backwards. Cable goes in logo down. Don't break your phone trying to force the cable in.Some wifi hotspots take FOREVER to connect to, even when compared to other phones.The burst mode for the camera seems inconsistent with timing.So... All things considered, for the price and what it is (a non contract phone) I am impressed overall. If this phone was new from Sprint with a two year contract Iimagine the cons would have more weight.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wow - 4G LTE for this price?", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "RZ4ZMEDE1U6RQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone - can't tell it was used at all.

Really good interface and really nice display quality. Camera take nice pictures and texting is very smooth. Only complaints is that screen is just big enough (I have pretty big hands) to be a little awkward trying to reach everything with one hand. Also the home button is really close to the space bar when texting so it is easy to hit Home instead of space bar when texting. I bought the phone for its top of the line dual band wifi capabilities because I like to do a lot of wifi calling and it provides really good quality!
