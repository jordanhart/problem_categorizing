Always getting the latest phones based on specs and being the latest versions no matter what the battery life is or the bugs. I have always been running beta software and until now it has always been because there was no real argument to use the versions of the phones that came with the devices. However the Moto X has made me rethink this. I looked at this phone and even though by a spec list it is not top of the line I can't tell the difference in performance between this phone and the HTC one(top of the line). This phone has some unique features that  no other phone even comes close.

I've experienced devices from HTC, Samsung, and Motorola.  This is my first phone with a near stock experience.  It's a smooth experience with no lag, crashes...just how one would envision Android would be.  Motorola's tweaks through Motorola Assist, Active Notifications, Touchless Controls are a welcome addition and I'm not sure how I'll live without them on my next phone.Storage:I was concerned about only having 16 GB of storage.  I've decided to embrace the cloud and the 50 GB of Google Drive storage for two years will help with that.  I've set all my photos to auto sync to Google+ and will wipe them from my phone to free up space.Screen Size:If you're coming from a phone with a larger screen like the Galaxy S III of S4, the screen size will take some getting used to.  The Moto X has a 4.7\" screen and the GS3 has 4.8, but the GS3's screen feels significantly bigger due to the fact that the Moto X uses virtual buttons.Battery Life:As a heavy user, I get far from the advertised 24 hr life.  I can get a full business day (8 hrs) with moderate to heavy usage.Camera:The camera is poor.  It get's the job done for social media uploads, but I've used other phones that have print quality.I'd recommend this phone to power users and new users alike.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "My all-time favorite phone", "Author": "PB \"pratipb\"", "ReviewID": "R1QL9W4DOIC6FF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a technophile and have used numerous smartphones over the past few years, including multiple BlackBerries, iPhones, and Android devices. This is by far the best phone I've ever had. Motorola has really hit a home run with this phone, finding the optimal intersection between the pure Android experience, a layer of non-intrusive and useful software optimizations, and hardware that is optimized to work well with that software.Love lots of things about it, including:- Voice activated search gets it right all the time. I can ask it the temperature, do a Google search, tell it to start playing a song, send an SMS message, and many more. Plus, it's always listening, so it works without pressing a button (you just say \"OK Google Now\").- Love the look and feel of the device. The device fits perfectly in my hand, yet it still has a huge screen. The back has a great feel and a little dimple that helps you orient it in your hand.- Twist your hand twice and the camera starts up. No screen unlock, no looking for the app, no waiting - love it!- Battery life is much better than my previous Sprint phone (though the battery isn't removable, which means I have to be a little more careful about usage)- The phone is fast and smooth. No hiccups or hangs, it just works.- Active notifications really work. Whenever I take my phone out of my pocket it shows the time and any new notifications I have without me having to press a button. It does it in a way that only lights up a small part of the screen, so battery life is preserved.- Automatically switches into smart modes. It has modes for meetings and driving. I only use the driving mode, which means that whenever I get a text message while driving it tells me I have a text message, and if I say \"Listen\" it reads it to me. I can respond by either automatically sending a message saying that I'm driving or by dictating a message - all of this without touching the phone.I've always been a fan of Android, but have recognized that the simplicity of iOS has tremendous value. With this phone I think that balance has changed, and that the innovative services the Moto X provides really make it a worthy replacement for anyone who is looking for something better than their iPhone.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is for the MOTO X with Republic Wireless. ...", "Author": "David Ecale", "ReviewID": "R1S6KYSWFJYP3O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Republic Wireless (RW) version of the MOTO X is a bit of a different gadget. It has been specifically modified for that carrier & cannot be used elsewhere (with the exception of WIFI calling & data). The phone has been modified with a custom unflashable  ROM. It is also *not* a rooted phone, so many apps which require root access will not work. It also exclusively uses the SPRINT system for cell calls and cell data.OK, That's the limitations. Now for it's advantages & etc. ... Here's my review of the phone that I wrote in response to a column in the WSJ (Smartphone With Wi-Fi Smarts):---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've been watching Republic Wireless (RW) for some time. I found that I don't use the \"data\" feature on my Samsung Galaxy S2 (T-Mobile) very much at all. And, I can live with the occasional inconvenience of not having it. This is especially so considering the price. When the MOTO X came available, I jumped & ordered one. I've been testing it over the past week since it arrived.Some notes:1) The first phone they sold was a bit of a dog. The second was better, but still barked. The third looks like it hit the sweet spot.2) The WIFI bias does have some potential for problems. The only ones that I see so far is when the phone is near an almost out-of-range, or heavily used, WIFI signal. Note: the WIFI has to be an open (unlocked) signal. In an area with only locked WIFI networks, it'll stay on Cell.3) The phone has a clean swap from WIFI to Cell with no hiccup. My S2 drops the call *every* time! Performing the same exact drive down the same street as I move away from my home WIFI & the MOTO X does a clean switch.4) The phone is limited to some selection restrictions: black, or white. So, bling is out, except for the case. I guess I'll just have to suffer.5) Phone shape: Very nice, except that I personally prefer a flat candy-bar style. So, it was off to AMAZON for a tailored case (just arrived this afternoon by UPS).6) The phone is middle of the road in it's smart phone features: Smaller Screen; OK processor speed; only 16G (11G, or so, available to the user); so-so camera; and the only one big negative, no microSD slot for memory expansion. Also of note is that the phone is sealed & you can't easily replace the battery.7) Available unlocked for $650 from various sellers. Subsidized by RW at $300 ($330, as tested) with ***no*** contract required! Just a month-by-month charge on your Credit Card.8) Ability to swap plans up & down to get extra features when needed. See, you can have data when you want it! I'm on the Cell Talk & Text w/WIFI Data only Plan.9) I have a MagicJack+, so I can put the MJ App on the phone & have a dual line phone when I am in an open WIFI area! I'm in the process of doing this now. It worked great in my S2, so I expect no problems here.10) And, yes, I use WIFI calling at home because I get crappy reception from T-Mobile (& before that ATT & SPRINT) at home. So, this phone & the plans & pricing beat the pants off of the competition for me.11) WARNING: It is *not* a rooted phone! So, you cannot run some Apps on it (such as Root Call Blocker). So, be advised, it's got some technical limitations. These are tradeoffs for the price & etc.Finally, I have a 2 month overlap before my T-Mobile contract ends. I'll port my existing Cell # over at that time. And drop my monthly charges from approx. $85 to approx. average of $13. ($10 + the usual taxes that you can't escape). Average plan + phone cost (amortizing the phone over 2 years - approx. $40/ mo. & over 3 years - $24/ mo.) is $40/mo.All-in-all, I'm extremely pleased with the phone & the service so far. I should point out that I researched on & off label wireless carriers for 6 months. My best general find was Walmart with their VOIP (MJ competition) & their bring your old (T-Mobile Phone) Cell plans. Both are quite a bit more expensive over time.So, my S2 is now mounted on a Grace Digital Stereo adaptor/charger system in my bedroom & has been converted to a small stereo & clock radio system. And, my even older Samsung Instinct is now used as a standalone MP3 player. Such is the march of technology.Special note: Read the fine print on your phone contracts. Do not toss out your old phone. You can still use it as either a WIFI only phone (ex. with MJ if you have WIFI capability) and as an emergency 911 phone.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------13 Dec 2013: An update. After purchasing another product (a case) that didn't work out, I replaced it with a better one. It is a PDair case (available from both AMAZON & eBay). This case isn't quite as nice as the PDair case for my now retired Samsung Galaxy S2, but it's still a great case. It does have some limitations, but is the best case that i have found for this phone to date. You can see my review of the PDair case on AMAZON.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Focus on the phone not the specs!", "Author": "JFrey", "ReviewID": "RFDGPF80HVQAB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Google and Motorola did something different here by actually focusing on how to give a better phone experience and not just cram the latest processor and highest pixels per inch display.

Touchless control while the phone is still off may seem gimmicky at first but the next time you're barreling down the highway in heavy traffic and need to set GPS navigation or quick send a text to someone because you forgot something without having to fumble with the phone is pretty handy. Also the active display is hard to live without once you start using it to get a quick preview of notifications without having to turn on or mess with the display. The device is super responsive running nearly stock android OS with virtually no bloatware from Sprint or Motorola. The phone is coated inside and out with water resistant spray.

Edgin", "ReviewID": "RBF3RZR7CDW3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm still just crazy amazed at my Moto X! It went one and a half days without charging. And yes, I was playing with it almost non-stop during this period! After using Mr LG Viper for 2 years and having to charge it 3 times a day...This is heaven!!!The Motorola Moto X uses \"Touchless Control\" which does everything for you. While the phone is locked and asleep, sitting face down on the table, all I have to do is say the launch phrase... \"Okay Moto X\", ...then say \"send a text message to John Doe\"... and the Moto X takes over. It will ask if I want the text sent to  \"John Doe's\" mobile phone. Then it asks what the text should say. After I dictate the text message, my Moto X asks to send message. I say yes, and it's done! Same thing with emails. I can also tell it to set a calendar entry, alarm clock, or general reminder. With my \"Jabra Extreme 2\" Bluetooth headset, I can do all this without taking my phone out of my \"Otter box\" holster. Ask it to call someone and it asks, mobile, home, or work. You can also set it to call based on history, so if you usually call someone on their cell phone the Moto X will call that one first.The voice recognition is spot on. I'd say it misses about one word in fifty...maybe!If I'm driving the Moto X \"knows\" to automatically notify me verbally of text messages, emails, and other notifications. It then asks if I want it read to me out loud. Then I have the option of responding without ever touching my phone. All so very user friendly, even an old geezer like me became an expert user almost immediately. Also while driving, I can say \"Okay Moto X...driving directions to Walmart\" instead of just automatically routing me to the closest Walmart, it gives me options starting with the closest. I then choose the one I want, and My Moto X launches Google maps navigation and gives me turn by turn through my ear piece.This phone rocks!!! The Samsung Galaxy S4 calls itself \"Life Companion\"...really?...REALLY? If that's true, my Moto X is a \"Life Simplified\". Look out world...Here comes ME and MY MOTO X!!! Lol!

Every bit as sharp as my friend's S4.The best advantage I have found is Active Display.

For reference, I came from an iphone 4S, which I did like very much.The design of the unit is mostly excellent.  I like how it fits in your hand nicely for a 4.7\" screen.  It feels solid enough, but build quality is a bit lacking compared to the 4S.  Also, the buttons (volume, power) feel flimsly in their mounting locations.  They work fine, but don't feel very solid.The screen is great but doesn't light up enough in bright sunlight; a very minor issue.  Mostly, it's just fine.  The AMOLED notifications are really nice, and I like how you can pick up the phone and unlock it from the \"sleep\" screen without messing around much (I do not have mine protected access).The software is mostly very good, but I do miss the music player from the iphone a little.  That said, I do like the \"instant mix\" feature.The camera works better than I expected based on reveiws.  Doesn't always take perfect pictures, but it does take beautiful ones if the light and the operator are aligned :)Overall, this is a very good Android phone, from the perspective of a guy who came from the iphone contingent.  Would I get this phone if I had it to do over?  Yes.

Since I've had this phone for a while now, and I am now equipped to write my review. I wrote one for the Galaxy Nexus(GNex) after that was released since I bought it the day it came out and my review received nearly 200 votes (mostly helpful), so it seems like people found my review useful. I've posted this review for all the different carrier variants since the hardware and software are all the same except for radios.Hardware DesignThe design of this phone is truly one to appreciate. The fact that I was able to customize the look of mine is not the reason I say that. I can say that this phone does not feel like you're holding an iPhone or a Samsung or any other phone for that matter. It does not feel cheaply made (and being made in the US, it isn't!). It had just enough weight and the part on the outside, don't feel like plastic like most Samsung phones. Don't get me wrong, Samsung makes very good phones, but they all feel cheap, but that's my opinion and others feel the same way. I happen to think the Moto X has a premium feel compared to my old GNexThe screen is much more enjoyable than my Gnex was. This is not to say that I didn't like the screen on my GNex because I did, but the colors seem better on the Moto X. Every user will have a different opinion though. Many people like the IPS Retina display on the iPhone and the best comparison to that is the LG G2, which has a great screen. The AMOLED screen on the Moto X is very good for me though.Continuing with the design near the screen, the rounded edges all around the front of the phone actually feel great. What do I mean by that? Since this screen is truly edge to edge, if you find yourself swiping from the edges a lot, you won't feel the sharpness an edge usually feels like.The mic is on the front of the screen and very noticeable, so when using speaker phone and turn the phone face down to have the speaker facing up, it results in the other person hearing an echo. Didn't have that problem with my GNex, but that is probably because the mic was not very visible on the bottom.I do have a gripe about the design of two things though. Perhaps it's because I'm used to have my GNex, but have the volume rocker and the power button on the same side (the right side), feels awkward to me. But Samsung has it correct in my eyes with the volume rocker on the left side and the power button on the right side. The other thing for me is having the micro USB port on the bottom of the phone and the headphone jack on the top. I don't like this part AT ALL. For those that don't have cars that have Bluetooth Streaming, this creates cord clutter. However, there are times where having the headphone jack on the top can be nice. For example, as a runner I take my phone with me on runs and use headphones. Since the cord doesn't need to go to the bottom of the phone that can make that experience better.SoftwareThe first Android phone I had was the Galaxy Nexus. So why do I say that here in this review. Well, I've experienced the software of other android phone through demo units and phones of friends. I don't like skinned versions of Android like what Samsung does to Android on their Galaxy phones. I do truly enjoy the stock Android experience. The Android experience is nearly stock android. There are some small Moto tweaks, but otherwise, it's the experience I enjoy.Active Notifications are truly awesome! Yes, this falls under software. Now what is that? Well instead of a notification light, a portion of the screen turns on when you have a notification, telling you exactly what app the notification is from. You can pick and choose what apps you want to show notifications through this feature. Now you might be wondering is the screen continuously shows this notification until you dismiss it. Well, you can dismiss it if you want to, but you can preview the notification and see if it's an email or a text or whatever app.Now for Touchless control. Some people may find this to be a gimmick, but it's actually not bad. I use it when in the car to make phone calls. That's about it, though occasionally, saying \"OK Google Now, what's the forecast for today\" is easier than launching an app. (call me lazy for that, it's true haha).Battery LifeI have been putting my phone through test of my everyday usage. That includes, streaming music in my car, using Google Maps for traffic conditions to and from work, texting, calling, checking personal and work emails, checking Facebook, taking the occasional picture and then some sports-related stuff too. I would imagine the average user might use their phone as much as I do in a typical day. Now, the verdict...it's very good. I was shocked at how well the battery lasted. I got more than a full day's worth of usage out of it (wake up at 5am to sleep at 10pm). That's 17 hours for me. That means most people should be able to get a full day's worth out of this phone before plugging in before going to sleep. Moto really did a fantastic job of optimizing the software, processor and screen to maximize battery life.CameraTruthfully, I haven't taken enough pictures to give a great assessment of this, but coming from my GNex, this takes far better pictures. The pictures I've taken have been in great lighting conditions and the pictures have come out great. If you want to get a good idea on the performance, you can google reviews. Keep in mind when this phone first came out, the camera wasn't great, but that was due to the camera processing software. They have fixed that. Droid-Life has samples of the before and after. They show that Moto fixed this. It's a 10MP shooter and should be good enough for everyone's every day camera taking needs.OtherThrough moto maker the phone came with Android 4.2.2. I have not upgraded to 4.4 yet becaue from what I've seen in forums, in 4.4, Verizon is able to block tethering for those who still have unlimited data (like me). I'm holding off on installing the update for now.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "LL", "ReviewID": "R2QL5SLXATX1H4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this phone!

This is my first Android phone, I shied away from them because until recently I'd always heard they were glitchy, I also was not fond of the size android phones were becoming; i just couldn't make myself get and carry around the Galaxy S4. When I heard this was coming out I was happy to hear that it is way easier to use one handed and I also liked the look better than the samsung but when I heard you could use it without touching it I was sooooo intrigued. I kept thinking of what I would use it for and wondered would it really come in handy or be more of a fun at first gimmick. Well I can tell you, not only do i get such a kick out of the feature but it is so useful. I actually use it to find my phone a lot (when you call out to it \"find my phone\" it gives loud ring back to you) and use it to set alarms all the time. The other feature, active notifcations, no more picking up and waking up my phone when someone texts me, i just put my finger on it while it's on my desk, and the text is show. Perfect. Oh, and you don't have to wake the phone when you want to see the time, you can just move it with your finger if it's on a desk, or just take it out of your pocket. I love not having to push the wake button dozens of times a day like on other phones.  And even though some rumble about it not having a quad core, it's fast, and smooth, not glitchy. Might be a fraction of a second slower than the galaxys but I don't notice at all. Probably the best part about the phone for me is the form factor though so if you are tired of bigger phones check this phone out.Criticisms:One downside is the regular black or white version only comes in 16GB, so if you like music on your phone you have to get the 32GB off the motorola site and don't get the sometimes very good discounts from amazon.2ndly, screen is not as bright and gorgeous as the HTC One, but the reason is because they use an amoled screen so that they can have the active notifications features which, again, are so useful.and the camera. It's okay, really not great. If I had young kids I often wanted to take pictures of at a moments notice and you usually use your phone to do that, warning, it might not get you what you need. You can get good pics, but you need really good lighting to get it.What it really comes down to is, if you want a brighter bigger screen, go samsung or LG or Nexus, if you want a phone that fits much better in your pocket and has some really smart features, really consider this phone, even though it's not pushed by reps in stores it really is a diamond in the rough.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, great size, few minor issues which will probably be fixed with future updates", "Author": "Kevin P Lord", "ReviewID": "R130ID34K8S33K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone, seems to have some hiccups with the web browser and bluetooth.

Appears to have a number of 'whiz bang' features:  (a) Can register with Motorola and then remote find and wipe the phone if it's lost/stolen  (b) Can buy a device and turn any HD TV into a wireless screen for the phone (mixed reviews online though)  (c) Ok Google Now voice activation (mixed feelings, see below)8. Surprisingly light9. The organization of apps on screens includes the option to bucket a bunch of apps together into a group.  It's a nifty option.10. Voice recognition for searches is excellent.  I use the Ok Google Now regularly to send text messages or set an alarm.  I like it overall.11. You can see multiple notifications and the detail behind those notifications without unlocking the phone, although you do need to swipe the phone to see any details (this was not apparent at first, but figured it out over a few days)12. The email app is an improvement in responsiveness, although it had trouble logging into Yahoo mail sporadically after accessing it fine for a few days.  It's also significantly better than my old Evo app for reviewing and accepting Outlook meeting invites.13.  The Google Now 'cards' are pretty nifty when they work.  I like seeing my commute time before leaving the house or my work, but wish I could use Tasker to just give me the commute minutes and not make me check the card each time.Here are the negatives:1. If you use the Google card that gives you directions for commute including traffic, while very handy, it decimates battery life.  At least 50% worse battery life when enabled when out of my house.2. The phone gives zero text regarding emails or texts received until the phone has been swiped/touched.  It will tell me that a new text has arrived, but not the actual message until I swipe.  My old Evo would briefly show if I had a missed call, who called.  And if I had a text, some of the information of the text.3. Even though supposedly Sprint has rolled out LTE where I live in Dallas, I don't pick it up at work or in my house.  I would have picked up the '4G' signal on the Evo at either location, although it was sporadic.4. The 3G data connectivity appears to be more spotty than my Evo was.  It times out more often, and although not certain, appears to be a slower 3G data connection vs my old phone.5. The Moto X forces you to save all contacts as a Gmail account profile, even my work Exchange contacts.  On my Evo, I had a choice between Google, Phone Only, and Exchange Only.  I think this is a really slimy practice.  Sprint and I did pay north of $500 for the phone, and yet Google forces me to give it free reign to my personal address book.6. In order to enable wifi location services for 3rd party apps, you MUST agree to google collecting anonymous information about you.  I don't know if my Evo did this too, but I highly dislike this forced relinquish of privacy.7. There is no `menu' button at the bottom as my Evo had.  I do miss it.8. There is no 'search' button at the bottom of the screen as my Evo had.  I think this is a design flaw, and worse than my Evo.9. There is no physical light when the phone is charging.  I fly a lot, and sometimes the charging ports are flakey and don't have a good connection to the phone.  The charging light was useful on the Evo.  I'll miss it.10.  I can't see the phone's screen in direct sunlight with default settings (it's capable of being bright enough, but doesn't come out of the box using auto adjust.  I use the app Lux to take care of this though)11.  The camera is disappointing.  I've taken side by side photos using the Moto X and my wife's 2 year old iphone 4S, and her pictures are better, every time.  It's a huge let down.12.  I get about 12gb to use after the bloatware, and after installing my apps, I'm left with about 5gb for media.  It's not awesome.13.  The transferring of data/contacts/media from my old phone was helped by Motorola's 'Migrate' program.  It's actually an innovative program, but for some reason, it doesn't automatically transfer contacts.  So I had to 'export' contacts on my old phone, transfer them to a PC, transfer them to the Moto X, and 'import' them to the new phone.  I suspect that had I upgraded to HTC One instead of the Moto X, this would have been much easier using HTC's Sync program.14.  It took me a while to figure out how to de-link my notification volume from the ringer volume.  So my preference is to have notifications never make a sound, just vibrate.  And while I can de-link, I believe it is impossible (at least without a 3rd party app) to set different ringer volumes for notifications and calls.15. I know it uses Wifi to determine my location.  This may not be an actual con, but I believe that means that my wifi profile is stored on some server of Google's, and if I go into a store that uses phone WiFi profiles to track shoppers, they actually know it's me and where I am.  Like many things on this phone, it's very big brother like.16.  Email searches are conducted server side, whereas my Evo did the searches on the phone itself.  The advantages of a server side search is that I will get more results than just the 'downloaded' emails that are on the phone.  But Sprint connectivity is slow, the searches are slow, they often time out, and I often can't find the emails I need to find.  I wish it was an option on how I want to do searches.17. Not sure if it's because of Sprint's network or not, but the phone routinely gives me messages that it can't connect to the email server for both my Yahoo mail and my work's Exchange email.  In addition, it lets me know with a minor double-vibrate notification.  So not only am I not getting my email, I'm constantly reminded that the phone isn't picking it up, and I need to make a decision each time to determine if it's a dumb 'can't connect' vibrate of if I actually got a text or real notification.  3 years with the Evo and never had to put up with this.As the title of this review said, and as the laundry list of 'cons' implies, I find the phone more annoying than pleasing at times.  I will say that it's fast and responsive, has great battery life, and is easy to hold and use.  These are the exact three reasons why I bought this phone vs some competitors, so from that perspective, I'm happy with it.  I'll try to update this review after I've had some more time to play with the phone.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great slim phone. $20 credit with Republic Wireless", "Author": "Tom V", "ReviewID": "R181WDK9CILOKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to go with the Moto X on Republic Wireless. The Moto X blew my mind away. Technology wow! Yes I know I\u2019m a bit of a Luddite when it comes to phones, but this one seems to do everything that over phones seems to do and is comparable to the latest Galaxy, iPhone etc. It\u2019s bigger than my old Defy XT, but it\u2019s very slim. Fits nicely in my pocket, fits nicely in my hand, easy to type on, and it\u2019s not a clunky UI like the Defy XT. It of course still has all the benefits of Sprint/Verizon network + WIFI, and that WIFI to Network handover seems to work fine for me. I got the 3G plan for $25 and the speed is more than enough for my needs.Prior to going over to Republic Wireless, I had been with Sprint for many years. I was reluctant to switch since I was getting a 25% discount through my work and anything out there could just not beat their price, but I was tired of their poor customer service and barely use any of the data that\u2019s on my plan (got really annoying when I was forced to pay an additional 10 bucks) when I\u2019m still using my old Blackberry Curve 8300. I never had any complaints with the service though. Rarely dropped calls and I had reception wherever I would expect it. With that said, at work I have zero reception.However I do have wifi at work of course and with almost all my calls are being done at home or at work Republic Wireless works out great for me. When I\u2019m outside a WIFI hotspot, the old sprint network or verizon kicks in and I have even better coverage than before. When I got Republic I started with their Defy XT. Despite that many say the phone is \u201cold\u201d technology, I actually like the smaller size and it\u2019s very robust. That\u2019s all about perspective of course. I mentioned my old bberry, so I felt the Defy XT is a huge upgrade for me. When I truck ran over my phone 2 weeks ago (the Defy could not handle that after all).Bottom line is I have been really happy with Republic Wireless the past 12 months and I have not had any problems with a cheaper \u201cinferior\u201d service. I\u2019m just savings lots of money.You can too if you use my referral link. You will save an additional $20 when you sign up, and I\u2019m not going to hide that I will also get $20 when you do.

My daughter got the LG Nexus 5 and she loves it, but it's bordering on a small tablet (like almost every other phone out there today) and it's just too big for me.  The Moto X is the perfect size for me, small enough to slip into a shirt pocket or more frequently one of the back pockets of a pair of jeans when not in my hand.There are plenty of reviews out there and the feature set is fairly typical and well established, so I won't go into any of that except to say that I have not had a single glitch with this phone in the several months that I've owned it (knock on MDF, particle board or whatever passes for wood today).  I shut it down and re-start it every now and then only because I like to do that periodically, but it has never required me to reboot it to fix anything.It smoothly transitions between 3G, 4G, wifi and no-G, and has run any app I've tried more than fast enough.  Ok maybe side-by-side with a quad core phone it might trail in doing something by 0.13 seconds, but in practice I have to say if that is meaningful to anyone then they value their fractional seconds more than I do.  In addition to handling web browsing and texting in stride, it also makes phone calls!  It sends and receives pretty clean voice, and the best news is that it doesn't feel like you're holding a small tablet against your head (in those instances when blue tooth or it's speakerphone mode isn't appropriate).I picked up a \"SUPCASE\" black case to put around it, which is slim and comfortable compared to the Otter Box I had on my HTC previously (the HTC was a glitchy phone).  It keeps the package nice and small and I have already dropped the thing from waist height (cold weather, dry hands) with no damage.I can't think of too many products I've purchased where there weren't at least one or more things that bugged me or that I wish were implemented differently, but I'd say that this is very close to one of those rare occasions.  Close because there is one thing that I think I wish was different: I wish it had a replaceable battery.  About a year or so into previous phones I've owned, I've put in an after-market new battery to get a little more life back.  Time will tell how the Moto X battery holds up as it's too early to tell if they've stuck a quality battery into this phone.  I can say that on days when it doesn't get a lot of use it has gone for 3 days before recharging.  Of course, heavy use drags this number down, but since I have other things of value to do with my time aside from diddling with a phone all day, I typically get 2 days from a full charge.Highly recommended.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Robert Parkinson", "ReviewID": "R3RV6NB15RE4SN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone.

Since I've had this phone for a while now, and I am now equipped to write my review. I wrote one for the Galaxy Nexus(GNex) after that was released since I bought it the day it came out and my review received nearly 200 votes (mostly helpful), so it seems like people found my review useful. I've posted this review for all the different carrier variants since the hardware and software are all the same except for radios.Hardware DesignThe design of this phone is truly one to appreciate. The fact that I was able to customize the look of mine is not the reason I say that. I can say that this phone does not feel like you're holding an iPhone or a Samsung or any other phone for that matter. It does not feel cheaply made (and being made in the US, it isn't!). It had just enough weight and the part on the outside, don't feel like plastic like most Samsung phones. Don't get me wrong, Samsung makes very good phones, but they all feel cheap, but that's my opinion and others feel the same way. I happen to think the Moto X has a premium feel compared to my old GNexThe screen is much more enjoyable than my Gnex was. This is not to say that I didn't like the screen on my GNex because I did, but the colors seem better on the Moto X. Every user will have a different opinion though. Many people like the IPS Retina display on the iPhone and the best comparison to that is the LG G2, which has a great screen. The AMOLED screen on the Moto X is very good for me though.Continuing with the design near the screen, the rounded edges all around the front of the phone actually feel great. What do I mean by that? Since this screen is truly edge to edge, if you find yourself swiping from the edges a lot, you won't feel the sharpness an edge usually feels like.The mic is on the front of the screen and very noticeable, so when using speaker phone and turn the phone face down to have the speaker facing up, it results in the other person hearing an echo. Didn't have that problem with my GNex, but that is probably because the mic was not very visible on the bottom.I do have a gripe about the design of two things though. Perhaps it's because I'm used to have my GNex, but have the volume rocker and the power button on the same side (the right side), feels awkward to me. But Samsung has it correct in my eyes with the volume rocker on the left side and the power button on the right side. The other thing for me is having the micro USB port on the bottom of the phone and the headphone jack on the top. I don't like this part AT ALL. For those that don't have cars that have Bluetooth Streaming, this creates cord clutter. However, there are times where having the headphone jack on the top can be nice. For example, as a runner I take my phone with me on runs and use headphones. Since the cord doesn't need to go to the bottom of the phone that can make that experience better.SoftwareThe first Android phone I had was the Galaxy Nexus. So why do I say that here in this review. Well, I've experienced the software of other android phone through demo units and phones of friends. I don't like skinned versions of Android like what Samsung does to Android on their Galaxy phones. I do truly enjoy the stock Android experience. The Android experience is nearly stock android. There are some small Moto tweaks, but otherwise, it's the experience I enjoy.Active Notifications are truly awesome! Yes, this falls under software. Now what is that? Well instead of a notification light, a portion of the screen turns on when you have a notification, telling you exactly what app the notification is from. You can pick and choose what apps you want to show notifications through this feature. Now you might be wondering is the screen continuously shows this notification until you dismiss it. Well, you can dismiss it if you want to, but you can preview the notification and see if it's an email or a text or whatever app.Now for Touchless control. Some people may find this to be a gimmick, but it's actually not bad. I use it when in the car to make phone calls. That's about it, though occasionally, saying \"OK Google Now, what's the forecast for today\" is easier than launching an app. (call me lazy for that, it's true haha).Battery LifeI have been putting my phone through test of my everyday usage. That includes, streaming music in my car, using Google Maps for traffic conditions to and from work, texting, calling, checking personal and work emails, checking Facebook, taking the occasional picture and then some sports-related stuff too. I would imagine the average user might use their phone as much as I do in a typical day. Now, the verdict...it's very good. I was shocked at how well the battery lasted. I got more than a full day's worth of usage out of it (wake up at 5am to sleep at 10pm). That's 17 hours for me. That means most people should be able to get a full day's worth out of this phone before plugging in before going to sleep. Moto really did a fantastic job of optimizing the software, processor and screen to maximize battery life.CameraTruthfully, I haven't taken enough pictures to give a great assessment of this, but coming from my GNex, this takes far better pictures. The pictures I've taken have been in great lighting conditions and the pictures have come out great. If you want to get a good idea on the performance, you can google reviews. Keep in mind when this phone first came out, the camera wasn't great, but that was due to the camera processing software. They have fixed that. Droid-Life has samples of the before and after. They show that Moto fixed this. It's a 10MP shooter and should be good enough for everyone's every day camera taking needs.OtherThrough moto maker the phone came with Android 4.2.2.

I don't expect much when using my phone, as it is built as that, not as a camera (although the twist to launch motion is amazing.  Easily get quick shots!)Since buying the phone, Motorola has put the camera, active notification, assist, connect, and touchless controls on the PlayStore, so they can update them just like any app.  This means that any time there is an upgrade, I don't have to wait for the carrier to finally release it!

I recommend this phone to anyone who uses basic functions, light gaming, browsing, etc (although I have played a few intensive games and it runs no problem!)", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product, at a great price!", "Author": "Rafael G.

Great product.  I upgraded from an HTC Evo 4G and this is blazing fast in comparison.  I love the OLED display and the easy on with a flick for the camera.  Super light and very sexy.

It's ridiculously fast and effortless and with all of Google's products already baked into it, I find it incredibly easy to use, especially with the awesome \"Google Now\" feature.  Instead of typing in addresses and sentences or pressing icons for commands, you simply tell the phone what to do or verbally ask a question and without fail it's before your very eyes almost immediately.I also love the look of the phone, how thin it is and how responsive and precise the keypad is.Finally, I think I've found a phone that I won't for one reason or another want to trade in six months from now.  It's so superior to much of it's competition.

Did someone tie the little googlers hands behind them?Google is limiting what you get, just like Microsoft did when they became the de-facto monopoly in their field.MemoryFirst of all it costs no more to put 64 gig internal memory on these phones than 16 gig.But wait there's more ... you can upload all your contacts and data to THE Google Cloud and let the NSA look through it at no extra cost.No memory card to put your extra files on. I have a 64gig card half filled with files, movies, songs etc. I could not use the Motorola if I wanted to.And two years from now, I don't have to pay for it. That is if Google even exists in two years. Can you say Netscape.When you hack something it is supposed to become better. This is a hacked down phone. Like a gardener who cuts down all the trees in your yard. Motorola Google-Degrade version.CPUGive me a break. A fake Quad. Everyone else has a quad core. But The vaunted little Googlers have found a way to make your phone 2 years old when you get it. 2 year old Dual-Core processor so your phone and apps will be slow. And a Quad-core (graphics only) processor so IF you can get a game to run on the dual core, The graphics will look good. What a waste of effort.BatteryI cannot tell if you can take the battery out. Are you guys turning into Apple. Is the plan the battery dies and someone buys a new phone? Just like Apple. It is so funny apple copied Android for it's new operating system.PROsIf you could store all the data, you can actually take 1080p movies. The 16 gig internal memory will fill up in about 10 minutes. So you will have to use Google spyware and put it on the Google Spy Cloud with the on site NSA/Google servers so it can be downloaded at the NSAs convenience so the NSA can see what you have been up to, only a little easier. Maybe that's what Google is doing with their quantum computer.What is with the Googler wrist action picture taking? Is this some new wrist exercise?  I can see the Gestures now . . .  no lady I don't mean anything by that . . .  I'm just taking pictures ... : )Are there no smart people at Google? This phone is boring, bottom of the stack, and almost useless.You might as well get an old clam shell phone at Goodwill.Oh Google ... email me if you want to build a big boy phone. The NSA has my number. Really ... they do! Not joking.Man, if I owned Motorola You would have a man's phone. The girls could use it too.Google whoever is in charge there ... Bezos has my permission to give you my Amazon email address, you need to call me and make the phone my project.It was nice pretending Google was a game changer. Workin' for the little guy.  The dream is dead.
