{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent basic phone", "Author": "Sundays", "ReviewID": "RRPC8OFVH4VRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I only need a basic phone for my prepaid plan and it meets my requirement. It has a lasting long battery which is a plus. It has a good reception compared to my previous NOKIA 2760. The battery power is really impressive. I made a 40-minute phone calls three weeks ago and a few short calls since then. I still have two out of three bars in the power gauge now.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very adequate", "Author": "Charlotte Hochman \"seawife2\"", "ReviewID": "R28XMTPR06XPTZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this phone because it is unlocked and has GSM bands to use in U.S. as well as abroad. I have owned it over a month. Seems to be adequate for very simple use. Haven't tried it overseas yet.  Camera not much to speak of, and does not have many choices of ring tones. Has micro SD slot. Feels a bit like a child's toy, but small size good for pockets, and has a nice finish and feel to it. Battery lasts almost 3 weeks between charges...I keep phone on all the time, but use it very little. Lacks earphone jack, but has a hands-free speaker feature, and bluetooth.Recommend it for a second phone for travel, or for a youth.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sturdy & with Longest Battery Life Ever!", "Author": "Annette Moore", "ReviewID": "R3SVQF77D0KT7P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to be a basic, hardy, back-up phone that can accommodate the two sims I needed to use. I have not regretted the purchase. The phone itself is cute, yet sturdy. The buttons are easy to press, it has a slot for an SD card, it has a camera and can take video. Moreover, I almost forget that this phone needs to be charged. I believe I have gone a month on one charge already - it's that good. Not even the Nokia phones hold a charge for that long. It's just amazing. Also, it has a very decent speaker and it plays FM Radio. I am calling this the hurricane-ready phone. The phone even has a flashlight. It's the kind of phone you want to have if you happen to get lost, leave home for long periods without access to a charging station, or just for if you are carrying out a normal routine. I highly recommend this phone as a backup handset or a main handset, for those who do not have many multimedia needs.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works Great!", "Author": "David Dohi", "ReviewID": "R39AETYKRQ6Y5Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can I say.

So, why only two stars?Operating this phone is very difficult, both physically and logically. The physical problem is that punch buttons are not very responsive. The central button has several functions depending on were you push it, and getting exactly to the center of the button (to lock/unlock the phone, for example) is not easy. Response of other keys is also not very reliable but it's less critical, than multi-functional central one.However, this is nothing in comparison with the logic of operations and navigation. Instruction manual does not exist. I found the manual for a similar model T190! ([...] but it is pretty useless too, For example, after a month of using the phone we still cannot figure out, how to customize some of the features - we perform customization, save it, and then it's gone, Navigation is not always intuitive and simple.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "good battery life, poor overall life", "Author": "A.

I need manual.  This one a joke.  Could not connect to Bluetooth, main reason, even when I went to car dealer.  Not compatible. As another reviewer mention center key was crazy.  Could not lock it.

I am very disappointed with this phone's quality because two phones were defective out of box.  The first one I ordered had no sound out of the earpiece.  It did not play the open and close sounds.  I could be heard, but I could hear no one.  The exchange phone was fine except that the keypad backlight was not consistent.  Some of the buttons had bright letters, some would be dim so that they did not show up well in daylight and one button did not light at all.  I picked this phone specifically because it was the most suitable for my mother, not for the price.  I am concerned that if I exchanged the phone a second time and was lucky enough to get no defects out of box, that something might go wrong later.  The only reason that I am giving this phone two stars is because I really like the phone and some folks might get a non-defective phone and it might last a while.  It is very light in its construction so is definitely not rugged.  Other than that, it is a nice looking phone, great battery (more power than my $99 ruggedized flip phone), big buttons, not as loud as it could be during phone calls for older ears.  The earpiece volume is sufficient for most phone users and the hands-free is quite loud.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00AA6WTT4"}}
