While it doesn't have the bells and whistles of some of the newer, more expensive phones, it has Android Ice Cream 4.0.4. It's processor is fast enough to handle running Netflix and Hulu plus, making it nice for watching shows. I have had issues with running Kindle on it, and it takes up a lot of internal memory, even with the app moved to the sd card so I don't use it on the phone. It does have access to the play store, which is nice. For someone who doesn't need a top of the line, newest phone or for someone who is wanting a decent prepaid phone without dropping a lot of money, I definitely recommend this phone!", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Huawei Inspira", "Author": "Katelyn Weller", "ReviewID": "ROSL8EUVKP5FX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would recommend this phone to anybody who wants a smart phone but not a super expensive one.

Before I had Sprint service which didn't work in my house.  I made sure the SIM card and phone I picked were compatible with the nearest AT&T; towers and I have been very pleased.  The phone isn't the best smart phone.  But it meets all of my needs.  Stays charged all day long and only has to be restarted every few days.  I highly recommend Straight Talk and the Huawei Inspira to everyone who wants to get away from 2 year contracts and over a hundred dollar phone bills per phone.  I spent about $40 on this phone plus just under $50 per month.

It is a great value for what I plan to use it for. The screen resolution is high def. The google play app allows for me to download plenty of my favorite apps easily. The set up is a breeze even for me who is no techy person. Having some difficulty finding a holder (protector) to fit this size phone. Now for the drawbacks. The ringer is way to low for my taste. If the phone is not right near me or in front of me I might miss the phone ringing. I need the sound louder. I will have to investigate or purchase a louder or more distinct ring tone (bummer). Also, the virtual key board has to be pressed rather hard to connect with the letters. I am not under 30 so my texting skills may not be as adept as the younger generation, but having to press so hard causes me to have a lot of misspelled words and having to retype what I am trying to text. The picture camera is clear and bright. I am still learning the features. I have only had the phone about 3 weeks. I need to learn how to forward a picture that has been texted to me if that is possible. I have difficulty finding my voice mail function so I can listen to my voicemails. A few other small glitches but that is probably just a matter of my getting more familiar with the phone. Otherwise, again a great value, nifty and good little workhorse phone for someone like me...I just want to talk a lot, text some, stream some, surf the net in a pinch and not drop the phone!
