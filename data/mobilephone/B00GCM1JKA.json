It shoots very clear shots now, the camera app opens quicker and the camera takes a lot less time to focus. If the camera was something that turned you away from the Nexus 5, then come back because the issue has been fixed. Google says they will keep working on the camera to make it even better.(Stay tuned for any other updates)Original Review:I sold my S3 to get this phone on the Google Play Store and I recommend you do as well (It costs less on the Google Play Store)[...] The total ends up being less than $400 for a smart phone that is priced way to low for what it has to offer.Pricing:$350- 16 GB$400- 32 GBA Snapdragon 800 Quad-Core Processor clocked at 2.3 Ghz? A Adreno 330 GPU, all these sound to good to be true! Such great specifications at such a low price? But, nothing matters if there is no applicable real world performance, and I'm glad to say that you will be zipping through games and apps!Here are some Pros and Cons:Pros:-Phone feels great in the hand, not to big or not to small-Great Build Quality, better than phones that use plastic like the LG-G2 or S4 (It uses the grippy plastic found on the 2013 Nexus 5)-Buttery Smooth and Fast as Lightning, this phone is that fastest phone I have ever used, hands down-Pure Stock Android (Kit-Kat 4.4)-You get updates as soon as they roll out! No waiting for months to get the next version of androidCons:-Because it only packs a 2300 mh battery, it does ok for daily use, but don't expect to get any crazy battery life, (Standby time is amazing though, it sipped through only a 1% of battery through the whole night!)-Camera is decent, but video quality is great! The mic is the best I have seen on any smart phone, (A software update may improve camera)-Availability, I love this phone, but getting your hands on one can take a bit, but please believe me, it is worth the wait!-Speaker is just all right, it sounds OK but not greatTotal Scores:Build Quality: 9/10User Experience: 10/10Android Kit-Kat (Nexus 5 Experience): 10/10Camera (Photos): 7/10Camera (Video): 9/10Speaker: 7/10Summery:If you looking for a phone that delivers the best Android Experience, a cheap off contract phone, a phone with great specifications, or just a phone in general, This is the best phone currently on the market.

My Fiance was given the white one and she loves it, and I love my nexus too. We both got the 16G versions, and haven't ran into too many issues with space since Google offers a lot of different cloud storage for media, which usually takes up the bulk of any storage used. We have had them for about 8 months now and they are still going strong. As is common with the Nexus line of phones they are usually the first to get every major Android update and it feels like you always have a new phone. As far wear and tear goes, they have held up pretty good, although my Fiance keeps hers in a case. I have two cases but never really use them because I have a magnetic dock in my car which works very well. I have dropped it a few times but no scratches or cracks yet.Bottom-line: If you want a phone that has great graphics, performance,  and feels new a year after you got it, all at a great price, then this is for you", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone with compromises, would choose again.", "Author": "Patrick S.

You can use HDR+ for everything, even action, and it comes out without blur and much reduced noise. Its not HDR in the sense you are used to, it doesn't look HDR like.

It is just one of the area's they compromised for the price or for thickness maybe.The battery is bad. Bad. I could get through all day with my HTC evo LTE, which had HD screen and 4g also, and still some to spare by bedtime. This phone acts like it should burn gasoline.

I feel like the iPhone 5s' camera may be faster however the clarity and screen size of Nexus 5 is more ideal for my tastes. The price from an upgrade 2 year contract was at an unbelievable price. However, it charged me the tax at regular retail price and an extra $35 activation fee on next month's bill. Read all descriptions before purchasing. I had read it and didn't mind it at all.

I don't like the fact that Sprint and all the other carriers are charging 450$ for a phone that Google on Google Play is charging 350$.  This is another way for these cell phone companies to keep the consumer under their thumb.  But, with that being said, the key word for me \"price,\" and for the price I really do like the Nexus 5, although I do have a few complaints about it.  Let me begin by saying that the white version of this phone and the black version are surprisingly distinct from each other.  I had believed that the white and the black version were the same exact phone just like every other black/white variation of every phone.  But they aren't.  First, they come in different looking boxes.  Just something that I'd thought i'd share.  Secondly, the earpiece (where the ear is when taking a call) on the white version is white while the black one blends into the black borders of the phone. Moreover, the white Nexus 5 is glossy around the sides whereas the black Nexus 5 has dull black sides,  Something to think about if one really cares about fingerprints on their phone (personally, I like the white version).  Now with that out of the way, the things that I do like about this phone is that it is very snappy and quick when swiping and bringing up applications, more so than some of the better spec phones such as the Note 3.  Another thing I like about the phone is it is light but it doesn't feel cheap.  It has a build that feels good in your hands.  And, the resolution on the screen is pretty damn good.  I am pretty impressed by the definition and detail when looking at the screen, and colors look great.  Now that's good news, but here is the bad news.  One of the first things that I've noticed when using the Nexus 5 is that the speaker is pretty weak.  It is not loud at all, and at full blast I couldn't hear the person on the other line when I was out in public.  Another thing that this phone is not good at doing is staying alive.  What I mean by this is that on one full charge, the phone will last about 4 to 5 hours max with regular usage.  If I don't use the phone much I may get a few more hours of standby time.  This bothered me because I need my phone throughout the day and I'm not always near an outlet, plus there's no way to open the phone and throw in a replacement battery. So, that definitely is a large negative for me.  Finally, another weak point on this phone is the camera.  Although the phone has a decent 8 mega pixel camera, the pictures I take in good light are not of great quality.  The pictures seem to be not of the right colors and it seems to dull the light out a bit.  Furthermore,  I can't take rapid fire pictures as each successive picture taken requires a about 2-3 second delay between each other.  But, the camera is surprisingly good at taking low light pictures.  As a matter of fact, the Nexus 5 camera in low light is better than some of the more premium phones with better cameras.  This is something that I really enjoy about the Nexus 5's camera.  Overall, if I was to rate this phone as a regular priced phone, (650-750$) or 200$ with a 2 year contract, I would probably give it 3 stars due to all the flaws (camera, speaker , battery life) the phone has.  But, for a 450$ phone or 50$ on a 2 year contract, this phone is exceptional.  It is exceptional because it functions very well as a smart phone (the touch screen is very quick and responsive and on 4G the internet is quick) and it has great screen resolution.  Personally I bought this phone outright for 450$ and I am happy with it.  But, I think I wouldn't be as happy if I paid 700$ for it.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone with issues", "Author": "Dwayne Morris", "ReviewID": "R2OO15GXELH9KF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had the phone for 3 months now and honestly the phone overall is a good phone but i ran into some issues that made me get rid of this phone and get the Note 3. First issue is the battery life. It is terrible I mean I was dead half way threw of the day and only thing i was doing was email and music. Second the phone on Sprint network seems to always never have any signal and if you have a 4g signal then answer the phone it turns off internet connection unlike other 4g devices when allows you to keep access to the internet if you have 4g.

Its as beautiful as black iPhone 5S and Kitkat OS is on par (actually better) with iOS. You can say its bigger iPhone (I mean it) because Android OS is more flexible, customizable and powerful and it is bigger than in size like its big brother. The bigger size definitely helps in games and all kind of media consumption.This device performance is buttery smooth and the overall experience inspires utmost satisfaction. Given its size it feels so light and slim even compared to iPhone 5/5s.It is not even best nexus device so far but best out yet among all.And now I will explain it.--------------------------1. Design, look and build quality-> I differ here from most reviewers who says its plain or boring and nothing stands out of this. Its as good looking as black (space gray) iPhone 5S. Its all black like iPhone 5s. Though its made of plastic its feels sturdy, well built with precision only known to Apple. And for the people who tell iPhone made of aluminum, Nexus 5 sides appears no inferior to iPhone 5S black sides. The front glass is very well fused with the body with almost no gaps. Now what we are left with? Back? The back of Nexus 5 is though made of plastic it feels very good in the hand and due to its matte finish does not seem to slip off.Now one step further...iPhone 5S black (or space gray) seems to have identity crisis of being black or something else, Nexus 5 black is perfectly black and it has got radically different sides (not plain round rectangle which all other smartphones have). The sides are beautifully something else.iPhone 5S beauty is revealing and Nexus 5 beauty being black is mysterious and never gets boring.I love this black beauty and don't blame for my taste as they said \"beauty lies in the eyes of beholders\".\"Simplicity is Beauty and Beauty is simplicity, nothing more, nothing less.\" - Oscar Wilde. If any phone on the market lives up to the Oscar Wilde's quote its Nexus 5.In short its unapologetically simple\".2. Processor/speed-> Buttery/silky smooth. Neck to neck with iPhone 5s and second only to Note 3 for all practical purposes.3. Screen/display-> Awesome. Its better than retina any time as its full HD. The feeling of display being washed up goes away very soon and remember the so called best retina have the same problem as they share the same display technology.4. Ecosystem-> Android eco system is as good as Apple's. In fact I find it better because of Android OS power you have kind of powerful applications which Apple fan boys can never have. Apple fan boys just give a try to 'tasker' (Warning: Only if you can handle Android's raw power.)5. Powerful Soul-> \"Fools are those who don't want their souls to be powerful.\" Its as good as iOS but better why? because its powerful and customizable. You can do the things with it when you need. Its no way comparable to inferior iOS. Apple fan boys! People should not be proud of a system which does not even let them change default for anything.6. Call Quality -> Fantastic. I have never had so clear voice on call for very long.7. Network Signal Quality -> Fantastic.8. Volume/Speaker-> Inherently the speaker is very loud. Though in some application it might sound a little short of enough but its software related problem and should be fixed in future update. I have tested the volume in many application like play and in some apps are freaking load. While playing music through play I had to cut down on the volume in car its so powerful.With headphones its fantastic. The voice quality is very superior and has no noise in it. Its as pure as it gets.9. Camera-> I have seen all the comparisons of Nexus 5 with all leading phones (HTC one, Nokia Lumia, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4) and its competing neck to neck in every department except its little slow to focus. But once it focus it takes very good images. HDR+ beats all other phones (I swear it). But again Google admitted it was software related issue and would be fixed soon through update. Personally I am pretty satisfied with the camera.Its at least best nexus phone camera and comparable to others except in little slower to focus. The photos are very detailed with accurate colors.Note: I have uploaded some photos for reference.10. Battery-> No complaints. Nothing great or bad here. Its definitely better than many old phones (including galaxy nexus) and equal to many others.It just falls short of only two smart phones right now which are LG G2 and Note 3. But it's battery is comparable to the best smartphone i.e. iPhone 5s. So if iPhone 5S can be the best with that kind of battery I don't understand how we could complain of Nexus 5. For casual usage you will charging it once a day. The noticeable thing is that in idle mode it does not eat battery at all and that's where it will average out better end of the day.11. Reparability-> iFixit has given its 8 of 10 in this department and you should feel comfortable saving your money on costly repair by doing many things yourself and the whole assembly is modular.Summary-> Even keeping its lower price aside, Its the one of best smart phone and should equal or better any best smart phone on the planet right now. And you add advantage of lower price...", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "NULL", "Name": "LG Google Nexus 5, White 16GB (Sprint)", "ImgURL": "NULL", "ProductID": "B00GCM1JKA"}}
