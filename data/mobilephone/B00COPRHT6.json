{"Reviews": [{"Title": "FAST.PEFECT.PHONE", "Author": "bonzai", "ReviewID": "R1PN0R1XYB0CR1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to have a Samsung Galaxy S2.  Then the S3 and now the S4 came out. I didn't want the same thing anymore.  I wanted something different, something bigger so I don't have to squint my eyes or pinch to enlarge pictures or texts. It was a toss up between the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 or the LG Optimus G Pro. At the time when I was up for a new phone the LG Optimus G Pro wasn't available.  I waited. Then May 3rd came, the pre-order day. I pre-ordered the LG Optimus G Pro so that I can get the free Folio case with it.  Based on the specs of the LG Optimus G Pro, I knew I wanted the LG over the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 because it was slightly narrower, has full HD screen, and faster. I definitely made the right choice.  So far I have nothing but praise about the LG Optimus G Pro.  Too bad they don't advertise it or market it as much as Samsung. To those reading this review, I can tell you that you won't be disappointed with this phone. It zips through everything, anything.  No lag. And best of all it comes with 32GB internal disk space to start, not like the more expensive Note 2 with 16GB.  Android is Android, and if you can get a phone that can do what you want without any issues then you have a winner.  LG has a winner, the Optimus G Pro.  You can't go wrong with this phone if you want a phablet with bells and whistles and lasts you all day long with its long battery life that charges about 1.5 hours on a full charge. What I really like about this phone is the multi-color home button that flashes teal green when you have emails or notifications.  Cool. I'm getting used to its size. I think I might stick with this size for my next phone too.  Hope this helps.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great device with very minor cons", "Author": "Fani", "ReviewID": "RODL2QBY1RVWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "+ 5.5\" screen @ 1080p. Bought it because the huge screen helps avoid carrying multiple devices, is easy to read and amazing+ Android 4.1.2. Not 4.2.2 but still good. Won't notice much difference+ Display is gorgeous and useful+ dual record camera is actually useful e.g. concert recording+ $99 deal+ 4G LTE from ATT is actually blazing fast. (around NYC)+ 4G speeds are good.+ has IR sensor so you can use it as universal remote but not as feature rich as HTC One's or Samsung's which has TV Guide integrated.+ smooth phone, no lag, not choppy+ Qslide (multi-tasking) is limited but could be useful+ LED light around home button is extremely useful+ excellent battery life - I charged phone all night. Next morning, used it in the bus for my 55min ride and used it to browse and read Pulse news. After the ride, it still showed 100%. I was amazed. After moderate whole day use, it had dropped to only 74% in the evening. Left it like that overnight and next morning it was only 61% (only 13% drop overnight). Auto-sync was on along with Power save.Charges very fast - 1.5 hrs from 0 to full charge.+ default wallpapers are actually very beautiful for a change+ has removable battery and I added my old 32GB ext card to add to the 32GB internal storage!! (64GB total storage!), again, all for $99 base price!+ Input methods are amazing - you can type, talk or use your handwriting to have it recognize the words. Talking works well in a quiet env. Handwriting is a hit about 80% of time. I found Samsung Note 2 more accurate here in OCR. Still, it is very good.- didn't come with any SD card- didn't come with the MHL cable which my 2 year old Samsung Infuse 4G did. C'mon.- NFC tags have to be bought (possibly from LG) for some useful features- sound quality isn't as good as HTC One which blows every phone out of the water. Actually iPhone's quality is better than this.- Not sure if Activation fee of $36 is waived or not with ATT.- strangely speeds drop to E (edge) speeds. Never hit 3G when 4G is not available? I'd expect it to drop from 4G to 3G or HSPA+, not Edge.- Original LG charge cable sometimes says \"Slow charging because of cable USB/TA charging current wrong\" or something. Very odd.- connected to my car USB and this is the only phone which makes my stereo say \"USB Not supported\".- after transferring videos to my NAS, only this phone's videos play with audio but with black video image. i.e. there is no video but only audio plays. Not sure if it is recording in some proprietary format or has some DRM that blocks it unless you use their LG transfer program. Have to research.- ATT bloatware cannot be removed unless you rootOverall, a solid improvement from my Samsung Infuse 4G.Edit: The device doesn't support UMS (USB Mass Storage) option which means if you use a linux machine, you cannot see the storage of the phone and mount it as /media/SDCard as before. There are only options for MTP sync or PC Software mode which doesn't mount it properly in Linux. So the solution is to get mtp tools on the linux (mine is ubuntu) desktop to fix it.Helpful instructions - [...]", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, coming from Galaxy S3/HTC One", "Author": "M.

I gave the HTC one a try for about two weeks but wasn't impressed, I mostly didn't like sense 5 and wasn't willing to live with it. I happened upon the LG Optimus G Pro online and it looked like a note 2 knock off but once I saw it and used it I found I was wrong. The features are very cool and the multi windows are great. The screen is gorgeous!!!", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Christopher Tran", "ReviewID": "R348W884NGX8CG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I came from an Samsung (1st gen) Galaxy Note so a lot of what I write will be with that in mind. What I was really looking for was the maximum screen size I can get away with but solve one of my annoyances with the GNote: its width.  Ii was simply too wide to comfortably use without really stretching my thumb to reach the other side of the screen without some hand contorting. Other than that, I utterly loved the GNote, The size didn't bother me as far as fitting in my pockets (quite easily) or how it made me look talking on the phone.  That said, I use my phone heavily with Google Map/Navigator as I'm driving.  I have it mounted on my center console and the size is perfect for me to glance at and get a reading on the traffic conditions around town.  Yes I can do that with smaller phones but I'd have to focus really hard and squint.  Obviously dangerous the longer you need to take your eyes off the road to look at the screen.  The iPhone 5 was horrible in this sense (I use one for work).  It's plenty sharp but at a distance, that sharpness is for naught.  The Galaxy S4 was something I was seriously looking into (along with the HTC One).  It was a slight decrease in size and it definitely solved my width problem.  And at a distance, it was a bit tiny but acceptable.  But the lag in the UI on the S4 turned me off.  I'm sure it was because of all the gesture bells and whistles, but I'd rather have it simple and snappy.  The plastic construction didn't bother me at all and I really don't know where people get off calling it cheap looking.  Looking at the HTC, I was impressed by the design, but felt that it made far too many compromises that I wasn't too keen on.  The non-removable battery, the same size chassis but with a smaller screen as the S4 and the Ultra-Pixel camera was not my thing.  I'd rather have more resolution than low-light performance.  I take pictures of building facilities and network infrastructure so it's nice being able to take pictures from afar and zooming in for the details.  I can't do that with the Ultra-Pixel, of course this is a personal preference.  Younger people who like taking pictures in clubs and restaurants might prefer the HTC One's camera.As I was zeroing in on the S4 as my choice, I visit an AT&T; store to play with it and I see the LG Optimus G Pro a few phones down the line and it instantly intrigued me.  It was all the same hardware setup as the S4 (with lower clock speed) and the One but a larger screen.  It is plastic like the S4, doesn't look at flashy but the screen is beautiful  After a few more times of visiting the store and playing with it here's what I find:The Phone is fast.  Although it has a slower clock speed, it zips around all of the UI elements with buttery ease compared to the S4 which stutter all over the place.  Just for an apples-to-apples comparison, I started Google Maps on both and performed a battery of tests: scrolling, zooming, satellite and map modes, searches, etc.  Again the S4 stutter pretty bad.  The GPro was amazingly smooth.The size of the GPro was just about as close to ideal for me.  Again, mileage may vary. If your priorities are different then this phone might not be for you.  I do a lot web browsing, maps, email, note taking, picture taking; pretty much everything but talk on the phone.When I first got the phone, it seemed that the battery didn't last much longer than my 2yr old GNote.  I was a bit disappointed.  But this was while I was doing a lot of App installation and tweaking the phone to my needs.  This would definitely be considered heavy, heavy use.  I quickly rooted the phone and also uninstall/disable AT&T; bloatware.  Starting the 3rd day when I really began using the phone normally I realize the battery life was not only much better than I first thought, it was stellar.  With light to moderate use, the battery was at 8% after 49 hours.  I was blown away. It may be a combination of de-bloating as well as a conscious effort at power management that allowed it to last that long, but no matter how you spin it, that is some staying power.  I couldn't even make the GNote last half that long just on standby.The screen is amazing.  Crisp, great in outdoor and moderate sunlight.  The details are pretty ridiculous.  Coming from a AMOLED plus screen, this unit definitely displayed truer colors, even against the S4.  Not to say the S4 screen is inferior, but they sure have different strength.One thing I do miss about the AMOLED screen was how dark the blacks are.  This IPS LCD display never truly comes close to true black.  I use my phone as an alarm clock next to my bed.  With the phone in night mode, the GNote was so dark that literally all you see is the dim time displayed over a pitch dark screen, very pleasing.  With the GPro, the background is a blue-gray that's just bright enough to be slightly annoying.Sound quality on this, in both the speaker and the headphone output is mediocre at best.  The DAC unit in this phone is pretty basic.  It really is no match for the advanced DACs that are installed in the S4, the One or the iPhones.  The fidelity is pretty muted and there really isn't a global EQ adjustment that you can use to improve this very much.  The pre-installed Music Player does have some Dolby optimization, which does improve overall range, but it only exist in that App, not in others like Google's Play Music.  Thankfully, this isn't a big priority for me.  If you listen to a lot of music on your phone, you may want to take a listen before buying.With my GNote, I was constantly looking to improve the phone's software.  3rd party ROMs and Modifications was the way to get it.  The last thing to consider is the Development community's support of this device.  I was hesitant because of this because, quite frankly, LG doesn't get the kind of love that Samsung and perhaps even HTC gets.  So as of now, you're not going to find a lot of 3rd party development of Mods and ROMs.  Making things even harder is the fact that this phone as a locked bootloader.  Both issues will very likely be remedied soon, but it might take a while.  This would have been a bigger issue for me if it weren't for the fact that the Software on this phone is so well put together (aside from the bloatware).  I have no doubt that eventually, I'll be looking to experiment with other Roms, etc.  But right now, I'm in no hurry.One of the coolest bonuses is the built in wireless (Qi) charging feature.  It spurred a little project of mine to come up with the best charging car mount setup.  I custom made a little setup using an LG WPC-300 charging pad, adding some embedded neodymium magnets.  I'm loving it so far.I started my smartphone experience with a Treo 700W (Windows Mobile), then several iPhones, Galaxy S2 Skyrocket and then the Galaxy Note.  I'm as brand agnostic as you'll find and I believe I gave all the current phones a fair shake before settling on the LG Optimus G Pro.  I still use an iPhone 5 at work, but it feels like I'd rather pull this phone out of my pocket when I want to look something up.Overall, I'm very, very happy with this phone.  It just plain-jane enough to not bring a whole lot of attention to itself, but has the power and elegance to impress the only person that matters: me.  Getting it for $99 on sale was icing on the cake.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "THE BADDEST SMARTPHONE ON THE PLANET", "Author": "R.

I highly recommend buying!!", "Author": "Christopher Jurkowski \"Christophe\"", "ReviewID": "RP2AU8RJRPKJF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone recently due it's reviews and I also played around with it at an ATT store before purchasing. I will be as honest as I can be so that people can get an accurate review. My first impression was that the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing. I have compared many other smart phones screens, and this phone has one of the best. Big, bright and crisp. HD content is out of this world. Sometimes I feel like I'm not even holding a phone. Build quality is excellent. The bezel around the phone is super thin, making it smaller to hold.You can feel that it's a nice and sturdy phone. Battery life is excellent. I don't know what phone the other reviewers had when they said that this battery is not that good. It is excellent and lasts a very long time. I'm a somewhat heavy user and it lasts me all day. The speaker on this phone is bad, but not horrible. It's too pitchy with it's sound. But it is satisfactory. Placement of the speaker is on the rear, so if you are playing music, you can't lay it on its back. LG should have placed the speaker in a diff area on the phone. Camera is pretty decent. Takes good quality shots. When I compared to my other phones, it was not as detailed, but still very good. Auto focus was a little slower as well. Video is excellent. Video was nice and clear with great 1080p. LG's UI is very good. I could find everything I needed without any issues. I don't know why people were bashing it. It's simple and easy to use. Everything is layed out just fine. The phone has quick memo and lets you write on the screen with your finger just like the Note, but without a stylus. To be honest, I'b prob never pull that stylus out anyway. Much easier with your finger. Phone can multi task and you can move your applications around on the screen (resize, transparency) as you wish. This phone has so many options in its user interface that it's crazy. Call quality is excellent. The home button is a little too thin for my taste, but my fingers go used to it. All of the other buttons where just fine and I am able to find them quite easily. The phone has 32GB of onboard storage and an Micro SD slot to expand for 64GB more. More than enough space than you will ever need. There is no lag on this phone at all. Its processor is super fast. You can tell right away when you launch apps and use things on it. It also has an IR Blaster to control your TV and cable boxes. I have to say that the IR blaster was super easy to set up. Literally less than a minute. I thought the phone would be too big, but I got used to it. I had no issues using it with one hand. In conclusion, I must say that this phone is excellent. For the money, you will not find anything even close to it. I picked up my iPhone 5 after a few days of using this LG Pro, and I could not believe how superior it was to it. I'm a stubborn Apple guy and didn't want to switch from Apple. When I looked at my iPhone it really felt ike I was looking at an ancient outdated phone. One you get one, you will see what I mean. You will not go back to Apple. Again...The 1080P screen on this phone is AMAZING! Although the Note 3 has slightly better specs, this phone comes very close with its beautifull screen and IMO and it's screen is better since it's an IPS. Plus it's like 200-300 cheaper. If your on the fence on this phone, don't worry. Buy it! You will not regret it one bit. This phone has not been advertised as much as Samsung and Apple, but it should have been. I'm really suprised more people don't know about this phone. I only found this phone because of the CNET reviews. If it had a better speaker, I'd give it a 5 rating. It's a great great phone.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Android phone I have ever owned", "Author": "M.

I read many good reviews for this device and still it seems like this phone deserves more respect. I have had this phone for a week and cannot say one bad thing about it.

Compared to the Note 2, this is lighter, thinner, and even overall smaller, yet still packs the same screen size, with the higher resolution.

I was quite impressed with its specs and features on paper, but was reluctant to purchase it because I've only used iPhones and Samsung smartphones before and couldn't really relate to what a LG smartphone would be. However, after hours of reading and also a visit to the AT&T; store, I decided that I really enjoyed the feel of this phone and had a very good first impression after a few minutes of fondling it around. I actually preferred the G pro over Galaxy S4.(both phones have almost the same specs and features, except for differing android skins and a few different UI experience enhancers).When I held the G pro in my hands I decided that I didn't feel it was too big, and I actually thought that the G pro's screen actually looked a bit better than the S4's. Of course, earlier, I had confirmed through some extensive reading that the G pro beats the Note 2 all ends up. [But I didn't purchase the LG G pro at the store itself since Amazon had it for $40 less]I expected a good product, but after 2 weeks of use I think that I am pleasantly surprised at how amazing the G Pro is. This phone really has exceeded my expectations. I really like everything about the phone except the fact that it has a plastic shell. [If this had a metallic finish, I would actually consider calling it perfect]The G pro is amazingly fast irrespective of the workload you put on it. I hadn't had even an instance where the system had even the slightest of a lag. The 1080p, full HD 5.5'' display is really beautiful with vibrant yet natural colors. The screen is large enough and the ppi is good enough to read even lengthy documents/ e-books. The camera quality (images and videos alike) is also extremely good. [colors are really natural]. I also like the 'LG specific features' of the phone. I specially like 'Quick Memo' & 'Q-Slide' (I think that's what its called) as these 2 features have really come in very handy even during these 2 weeks.All in all I have never been this happy with a phone purchase before in my life.

I have had a Galaxy S3/Galaxy S4/Note 2 and I prefer this phone over both.  The LG Skin over Android is actually pretty good and some of the added LG features will make me consider LG over other phones in the future.Look and Feel:The Optimus G Pro feels like a sturdy, well-made device.  It is comfortable to hold, although some people may be turned off by the weight.  This phone has a little weight to it, but it comes to be expected with such a large display. Many people will see this phone and think it is a completely Note II ripoff.  I will say that LG did lend a good bit of their design from the Note 2, but LG improved in areas that Samsung was falling short.  The Optimus G Pro is just a slight bit more narrow than the Note 2...and it makes all the difference.  This phone is much easier to hold.The button placement is a little interesting.  The volume key is on the left side of the phone and in the middle.  The top left key is almost a shortcut key that can be assigned to a particular app.  While this key is helpful, I would prefer the volume to be in a familiar location.  The other oddity to the button placement is the back/menu capacitive keys.  They are flipped from what many people are used to in the Galaxy series.  It took a few hours to train myself of this change, but it was off-putting for a moment.Speed:This phone is crazy fast.  Menu navigation and app launching are extremely smooth.  The quad-core processor is a definite plus.  This phone also has 2GB of memory.  This, along with the processor makes apps run very nice.Storage:The phone comes with 32Gb of internal storage.  With a SD card, you can expand to an additional 64Gb.  I love the SD card feature on phones and I doubt I will buy another phone without one.Camera:With a 13 MegaPixel camera, pictures come out very clear and detailed.  While I did not do a ton of low-light testing, the results were adequate for my needs.Screen:5.5 is a very large screen.  For most, you will not be able to touch all points on the screen with one hand.  LG (similarly to Samsung) has added \"One-Handed\" features that shift the keyboard to the left/right to make one-handed operation much easier.  I do not have a problem with any of these things because I was in the market for a phone in this size range.Battery Life:I am a heavy user of a phone.  I have two emails accounts that sync, I play games, check facebook, etc.  My screentime is usually over 3 hrs.  By the time I go to bed, I usually have around 50-60 percent battery left.  LG has done a great job in this department.  No complaints here.Extras:One thing that I have NEVER seen mentioned in a review is WIRELESS CHARGING.  I love this feature.  This phone comes ready to do Qi charging.  You can buy the charging plates off of amazon/ebay for under $50.  This was a pleasant surprise when I got the phone.

This is my fourth smartphone. I've always hated the fast battery drain that is characteristic of most cell phones. That includes even the most popular phones such as the S3, S4, Nexus 5 and HTC One. Based on the reviews the LG G2 has the longest battery life of any phone out there right now. However the LG Optimus G Pro is in the same league.

The added flexibility of being able to replace the battery while you're on the go is incredible.4) Thin and light.

The LG Optimus G Pro is a better phone IMHO (In My Honest Opinion, for those who are new to the internet.  May I be the first to greet you.)  The screen is significantly bigger, the interface more intuitive for both advanced and new users, and the processor is very fast, allowing for games, videos, and music to stream and play with almost no interruptions.  It has a built-in temperature control element (something the Atrix 4G lacks) that will temporarily adjust settings to prevent the phone from crashing.  This has happened only once since I've had the phone, and I play a lot of graphically intense games.  The phone doesn't natively support Flash, but there is a third-party app to fix this problem (ie not available from the Play Store).  My wife, who is not used to using smartphones, found this phone much easier to use than the Atrix 4G.  The larger screen is much easier on the eyes when watching movies or TV shows, and for following GPS directions.  It has plenty of internal storage, plus a slot for microSD cards to further expand your storage capabilities.  The camera takes excellent quality pictures, and the camcorder takes great HD video.  It only has digital zoom, not optical zoom, meaning that zoomed-in pictures or video will be slightly to moderately pixelated.  The battery life will last you a very long time when not in constant use.  For heavy users like I am, it will last you for most of the day on one charge.

In an attempt to make emergency calls easier to make, they've made it possible to butt-dial 911.  At the lock screen, you press and hold the emergency button for only 2 seconds, then press the 911 speed dial.  Something that can easily happen in a pocket.  Or with a toddler, for that matter.  For this reason, I give it four stars instead of 5.  The solution?  Buy a phone case that can cover up the screen while not in use.  Yes, it is that simple.  Thankfully, it is not a crime to butt-dial 911, or I would be serving lots of jail time right about now.

Battery life is nice though can be increased by use of 3rd party app or purchasing the 9000 miliamp battery here on amazon. The display is top notch. IPS display is very true to nature colors. Not as much saturated colors as the AMOLED display of the Samsung. Though the 5.5 inch display can be daunting to people with less than large hands.

The earlier cell phones did not haveinternet streaming nor could you get apps or music. The cell phones were more like a home phonecompared in size and looks and they were not touch screen like they are today. However we sawmany small phones in the last couple of years and it seems that the sizes of the cell phones aregetting bigger and more high tech. The LG Optimus G pro is a very big phone with a 5.5 inchscreen.I have been using the LG optimus G pro for two months now and I love it, it has not givenme any problems at all. At first I was skeptical about the size but now I have grown used to thesize. A problem I did encounter however was that I could not find many accessories available forthe phone, so I had to buy my phone cases online. Other than that the phone is wonderful I use iton a day to day basis the battery life lasts all day but I do charge it every night. The phone itself isvery fast whether it is opening an app, watching a video or simply turning the phone on or off.The LG Optimus G pro is a new phone that just came out and it is compared a lot with theSamsung Galaxy note 2. They are about the same in size and shape and the optimus is cheaper, butI chose to get the LG Optimus G pro because of its features. When watching videos on the phoneyou see a very sharp and bright video without any pixels, they also load up really fast. The phoneis also very loud for having one speaker on the back. The phone also has a lot of internal storageand you can also expand that by inserting a SD card. I did this and now my phone has a lot ofcapacity for my photos, music and apps.I love to take pictures and this phone does the job for me. The phone has a 13 megapixelcamera on the back and a 2.1 megapixel on the front. So this phone is a good phone for takingpictures. When taking pictures you can enhance the sharpness of the picture before taking it.Something that I really like about the phone is the home button because it has lead lightssurrounding it. So when I get a message or a missed call the home button turns green and when Iget mail it turns purple.This phone is also very good for multitasking I can have three different things running onthe screen. I usually have the calculator, a video and texting on the screen at the same time and thisdoes not cause the phone to work slower, it continues to run fast. When downloading apps ormusic or anything else, they are downloaded very quickly on to the phone. The phone also has avoice command which has come in handy for me because sometimes I do not feel like typing andthe voice command picks up everything very good I have not had a problem with it.The phone also has a rotating screen so you can use it horizontal or vertical. The phone canalso be personalized to my likings so I can change everything to the way I would like them. Someapps that I use daily on the phone is pandora, instagram, twitter, and the phones music player andthey run great everything gets loaded fast which I like. I also read a lot on the phone and with thebig screen I can read clearly and the words are not small. Internet streaming on the phone is verynice and fast, so I can search for something very quickly and it is not difficult to use or I can usethe google search engine on my home screen.A downfall about the phone for me is that I usually like to have my phone in my pocket butseeing as this phone is larger compared to others it does not fit in my front pocket and it sticks out alot in my back pocket. So I am usually holding the phone in my hand which is a bad idea because Ican lose it easier that way. However I do love the size of the phone but I do not really like carryinga purse with me all the time.

Finally, the hardware technology and software maturity have come together in a device like this. It is really a pocket computer, tablet, and phone in one package. With Android Jelly Bean and Google Now plus all the great available apps, the G Pro is a secretary and personal assistant that fits in your pocket! The LG Optimus G Pro is breathtakingly fast, faster and less laggy than my friends GS4. The IPS LCD display is beautiful and viewable from very wide angles. It's also bright enough for viewing in direct sunlight. The viewing experience is closer to watching an HDTV at home; more so than Samsungs AMOLED displays. At 5.5 inches the display is just big enough to really enjoy web surfing and movies. I have a full 96GB of SSD equivalent \"hard drive\" space since I added a 64GB SDXC Class 10 micro-SD card: Komputerbay 64GB Class 10 UHS-1 Grade 1 70MB/s MicroSDXC Pro Memory Card using Samsung NAND with Komputerbay SD Adapter. Meanwhile, the wireless and 4G LTE data transfer rates are fantasic, and I'm getting a full day of heavy use with the 3,140 mAh battery. Add the camera, NFC, sensors, and IR blaster, and it's just icing on the cake. In fact, the LGs camera and video performance are so good that let's hope no one like \"Anthony Weiner\" gets a hold of the G Pro!The Optimus G Pro with it's 5.5 inch screen is really at the comfortable limit for a pocketable device. A fairly good assortment of cases and screen protectors are also becoming available for the G Pro.

I have also had devices from Samsung, HTC, LG, and Blackberry, but none had ever embodied my dream of a true computer I could always have with me. Finally, that dream has been realized in the Optimus G Pro. I resisted the urge to jump on the tablet bandwagon knowing that a tablet would never be something I could always have with me, and it wouldn't make calls. The first phablets from Samsung were also not quite good enough to do everything. With the Optimus G Pro, LG has created the ultimate mobile computer that just happens to make phone calls too. I don't miss a stylus either. I had one with the UTStarcom that stowed in the phone like the Notes do, yet I still managed to lose a half dozen of them. In addition, I actually found that a stylus slows things down in the time it takes to pull it out and then restow it. Now with the LG Optimus G Pro I just dictate notes, calendar entries, shopping lists, and reminders.Sure, the Note III will be out this fall along with phablets from others like HTC. They will also be packing the latest Snapdragon 800 quad cores and 3 gigs of RAM. However, they will come at prices 3 times that of the LG. I got my Optimus G Pro as my first upgrade in 3 years on ATT for $60. It's an incredible value now going for less than half of what the GS4 and HTC One are selling for.

So I came up on my AT&T; upgrade date and headed down to get the Note II, when perchance I came upon the LG Optimus G Pro on display.  I liked it immediately.  So much so that I left the store not getting the Note II so that I could do a little more research (who ever heard of a serious LG phone, not me anyways!).  Come to find out the phone speced out pretty good and was getting great reviews on-line.  To make a long story shorter, I checked Amazon's price, $60!  I went all in and ordered it and a couple of accessories on the spot. That was about 3 weeks ago and the phone has turned out to be fabulous!!  Gorgeous 5.5\" display, very fast operation - smooth everything!  I liked the fact that it was not loaded down with bloatware like the S4.  Jelly Bean Android is cool.  I could go on and on!  Is it perfect?  No.  But the cons are few and far between.  The speaker phone speaker is weak and rattles a bit at full volume, though music sounds fantastic via headphones.  And of course it is a \"phablet\" so one-handed operation is pretty much out of the question ~ so if that's important to you, you need to look elsewhere.  Overall though, this is a great phone.

Every time I pick up the device using my left hand, I always end up pressing the volume control and max/min out the levels. I have tried various ways to handle the device and invariably, always press the volume. This is one annoying design flaw and wish they would have moved it to the top or on the right side of phone.

Has a great display that is large, a notification light, very fast, and the camera quality is pretty good (but lower those expectations just a little bit if you were expecting a camera similar to the Lumia 1020 quality lol).  One of the more impressive attributes is the quality of the calls that you hear through their HD voice quality technology.So why the 1 star?  Well quality is very crucial ingredient when buying a phone.  This isn't a $25 shirt or a nice meal out, this is a $600 electronic, and for $600 of hard earned money, you would easily expect it to last without anything breaking as long as you take care of your product.  So the very first thing I did when I got the device was I put it into a case.  Then I made sure I gently placed it down on table tops, etc because I wanted my product to last.  One day I am sitting at the table for lunch and see a reflection striking my eye coming from the camera.  Turns out there are four large cracks in the glass.  How???  I have done nothing but cradle it.  It is poor quality.  Whether the composition of the glass is not made with the best quality formula, or for cost they try to make the glass as thin as possible so that breathing on it shatters the display, this is without a doubt clearly poor quality parts.  If this glass shattered on the camera on the back, just *imagine* what can happen to the front.  I am waiting any day now where I randomly cough and the front glass shatters leave my device unusable.Better yet here is their response: \"While we constantly strive for better ways of keeping maintenance to a minimum, occasional failures can occur. Unfortunately a cracked screen is not covered by our warranty.You are still able to send your device in, just paying for shipping cost, and we will determine if it will be covered or not by our terms and conditions.\"How convenient.  They go ahead place cheap parts into their devices, then say they don't cover it, and it's a win-win for them.  So now that 13MP camera just became a [13MP - (wear the cracks are)].  It's really pathetic if you ask me.  If anyone currently has this phone, I strongly urge you to be very careful with the phone and soft pad the back camera when not in use.  As for the front, we all have to cross our fingers nothing happens.  Remember, no breathing, blinking, coughing, or sneezing.Two things are clear: They are not made well and LG doesn't care.  Stay clear of this phone and go with a Nokia, or an Apple, or an HTC.  Something that is well known  and has the reputation of a better build where if the glass actually breaks, you most likely dropped it and it wasn't protected unlike LG (and even Samsung with their notorious poor build quality on the Note II and S III if you google search their problems).Ed", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "RIP off from ATT", "Author": "joel james", "ReviewID": "R3F1CVE5LCLJZE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had been observing this product for a few days, and decided i was going to purchase it.Saw the reviews,eventhough everyone was bashing it for a note 2 imitation,i was going to buy one.Then,2 days ago, ATT increased the price from $414 to $749.I am sure their profit was already huge at $414,why the increase?
