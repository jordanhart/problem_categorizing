I've had it for about 2 weeks. Really simple to use. I'm by no means a phone expert, so I'll just give my SIMPLE review.The bad:-I'm used to going two or three days without having to charge my phone, but I just charge it when I go to bed, and don't have a problem with it dying. If I don't charge it at night, I might as well leave it at home, because it's going to be dead before I know it.-Only having it for two weeks, it has already warned me that I was running out of space. I eventually moved my apps to my SD card (that is included), and that freed up space. But I'm sure I'll need to upgrade the SD card, but the phone itself doesn't hold much. (I think I have downloaded about 6 apps)-No flash for the camera.The good:-Fairly simple to text. I have always been a little nervous about a touch screen. I've got wide thumbs, so I was afraid it'd be almost impossible. Very impressed. Easy to text!-Obviously, you can't be the price for the service ($50 for unlimited talk, text, and data) and the phone.-Very easy to navigate.I did alot of research on this phone before I bought it, and the pros definitely outway the cons. I'm finally up to date, and for a lot less money than alot of others are paying!

But being BIG on Android devices I didn't want to give up. I took a chance on this cell phone after reading a positive youtube review on it and I gotta say.... I LOVE THIS PHONE!! It is easy to operate, it streams video VERY well with very minimal buffering. The sound quality is LOUD! It has several accessories available for it here on amazon as well. It works off of ATT towers so the signal is strong even when your not in the city. I am going on 3 months with this phone and it has worked flawlessly! I do highly recommend you purchase an SD card of at least 16 GBs of memory to go along with it. This is Straight Talk's most solid Android phone on the market right now if you ask me! At least for the price.PROS:good video streamingloud speakerscharges FASTdecent battery life with the right battery saving appsUPDATE***CONNS:Over time the metal around the charger outlet spreads out after a month or so of daily charging to the point where your wall/car charger no longer will work and your charger stem becomes loose inside of it.  It's frustrating but I did learn cell phone stores with on duty repair guys do have a tool to fix that.Like several Android phones, internal memory is pretty weak.

There is only 160MB... Google pre installs apps which take up like 45% of the memory. Then with out permission new apps are installed which are un installable. Which takes up like 15% of the memory. So you are left with very little memory. After about a week the cell phone started to have issues with programs. All the programs are malfunctioning and the WiFi stopped working. The GPS also stop working properly. Also the sound buttons have a extremely light electrocution. Almost unnoticeable. Also for some reason when I unplug my ZTE my tablet Kindle Fire starts to turn on and flicker. Also my laptop stops working when my cellphone is put onto my computer. Yuck don't get this cell phone.UPDATE------------------------------------------------------------------This is a Post LTS review.

At this point, however, It's a very good phone. I had sprint service before, specifically the HTC EVO, which only worked when it wanted to. I should say that I really loved HTC but the EVO I had was very unreliable. I have a review for that, if you look me up, but I was very angry at sprint and that phone at the time, so don't judge me by what I said there.At any rate, either sprint service or that specific phone (I am inclined to think it was the combination of the two) just plain sucked. I am very impressed with THIS phone so far, however, and do currently see fit to recommend it. I easily transferred my number over from sprint (I was expecting the transfer to be painful because sprint assured me transfers to/from tracfone/net10 NEVER go smoothly and I would most likely lose my number in the process).I have to admit I was just expecting this phone to get me through until I could purchase an HTC One, or some higher quality android phone and then install a net10 sim card in it. I really didn't expect much from this phone at all, just a temporary fix for me to get rid of sprint. I don't know if it was my low expectations or just simply the fact that this phone and service is super good, but I am impressed so far. It's definitely not a high-end android. HTC is superior quality to this phone, but it does everything I need it to do and I like it so far.I will still probably get an HTC One, or a Samsung Galaxy of some make or model, but I will not be in nearly the hurry I expected to be in.I had a test with phones ever since the EVO. I call it the youtube test. Let me explain. I bought 2 other phones out of pocket before I terminated my sprint contract early (because I couldn't stand the frustration of paying that much money a month for a phone that didn't work). One of the phones was a Blackberry and the other a Palm Pixi. With my EVO I was NEVER able to play a simple Youtube video. It just wouldn't do it at all. Later, I got a blackberry and it would try, but never really could play through a whole video without crashing. Then, I got a Palm Pixi, and (big shock) it wouldn't play youtube videos without stopping at least 3-5 times for at least 15 seconds or more. This is my test. If I can play a youtube video without constant interruption on my phone, I know it can't be all bad.Imagine my elation when, today, after the number transferred seamlessly within probably less than half an hour (regardless of what the sprint store tried to tell me) I was able to click on youtube and play a video without any interruption whatsoever! Yep...this phone's a keeper.Seriously, though, the only complaint I have so far is that it seems like some apps (only one so far that I've found) aren't compatible with this phone. I just really wanted Pocket Frogs back, and it's not compatible. I really could have cried... But if that's the only thing I can complain about, then it's definitely a good day!

Why, why, why do we ignore bad reviews?  I did and purchased this phone.  I had read many good reviews on this phone.  I also read many bad reviews.  I was a little cautious because I have never heard of ZTE.  There's a reason for that...because it's low quality.  Yeah, it has a lot of features for such a cheap phone but CHEAP is the operative word in this sentence.  From day 1, it would constantly shut off during web surfing, texting, calling, etc....which made me lose valuable information and time.  Don't even get me started on what I had to go through to return it to the prepaid wireless company......that's in another review.  Still sitting here without a phone, waiting for the replacement.  And when I get the replacement, the month's service that I had already paid for, will be expired and they will not reimburse me AND I have to change my number AGAIN because they will not save my number for me.

Tons of use. Texts, calls, occasional facebook, and various other sites. It's has it's pros and cons but hey it was 100$ so I won't complain much.:Great sound when talking, ultra loud speaker, for music and talking. Actually has some kick to it, bass.:Very touch sensitive, sometimes to much until it locks. Occasionally I've put it in my pocket and it will open something, but that can all be adjusted.:The back cover is basically like a built on/in case, it's more of a rubberized texture and doesn't show scratches at all. I've only dropped it a few times, but enough to think I scuffed it up, looked and it was fine. Big selling point for me.:2.3 is very easy to use, just disable updates and it will quit bugging you after a while, phone doesn't have much built in memory. So for those of you wanting tons of apps don't think your going to store them ON the phone. Most apps will go to the SD card.:Also the volume control works great, very loud ring, and nearly to much vibrate. That's all good though.:Good solid build quality, doesn't feel cheap like some of the slim phones, especially LG.A few bad things, pretty much the same with any phone, even far above the 100$ price range.:Android 2.3 quirksScreen will go black (sometimes) during a call which won't allow you to hang up, so your forced to wait for the person to hang up, or you have to shut down the phone. Then restart it. Although many times it eventually lets you hang up. Can be slightly annoying.Call waiting is a bit odd when switching calls, doesn't always run seamlessly.I haven't used many phones with wireless connectivity, being that I swore to never get a touch screen. This one is touch and go, sometimes it's very very slow, sometimes it's very fast. VERY quirky. Definitely not a Samsung Galaxy or Iphone in that aspect.I don't think the camera is really 5mp, more like 2mp. ZTE have a reputation for putting the wrong specs on the site and the box. For instance I thought about getting the new Illustra they are offering because it says it has/had a 1.0ghz Processor. Come to find out it's an 800mhz one, \"according to the site\". Box says 1.0ghz. So who knows.Battery life was good, now it's starting to wear down a bit, but I have used it a long time. And from what i've heard NO phone out there has the battery life it claims. Not even Iphones. But they sell the extra batteries on here for around 8 bucks.So it's not a stellar phone, but it is quick for texts (especially using the Speech to Text app), works great. Also fast for just your average tasks. But if your an average user  (like me), this really won't bother you.Just because this phone doesn't take your blood pressure, drop your kids off at school or launch rockets into space doesn't mean it's bad. It's all anybody should need, but not what everyone \"wants\". I like it, I have it, if I have to I'll purchase another. That being said ZTE may not be the biggest company in phones (prepaid) but they are just as good as any known brand out there, with the same drawbacks as one 399$ or more. You be the judge.

First of all, alllllllllll of my photos glitch! I looked online at other reviews and this has been mentioned, but I never knew it was to this extent. Another problem I had was low storage space, and theres nothing you can do because all those apps are pre installed on the phone and you cannot delete them.
