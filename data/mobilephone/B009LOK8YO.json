I got this phone because I was not happy with how small the iPhone 4 screen was and I always wanted a phone that has a nether android or Apple on it. I have had this phone for around a year now and I have drop this many of times and my screen has not cracked nor has my screen been scratched. Unlike an iPhone witch would have been broken instantly.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "cannot give this phone more than 2 stars", "Author": "llcoolv", "ReviewID": "R3JK1L6UHL7IKY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As the description of the star count indicates - I do not like it ...and that's about it.I bought this phone used, so I am not going to comment on the sub-par battery life, as that may be co-related to the habits of the previous owner. However, the windows 7 (and the upgrade of 7.8) are an absolute joke. I give the two stars only for the originality of the phone and the sturdiness. The biggest negative that I found with this phone is the fact that it does not support the running of apps in the background. As an user who heavily depends on people getting hold of me on Skype, with this phone every time I open an application forcing Skype to into the background, the phone automatically shuts Skype up, forcing me to go offline and making the app completely useless. Another negative is the lack of apps in the Windows market. Seems that developers do not care about the Windows phone platform as games such as words with friends do not even work properly and others such as Song Pop are not even available. What bugs me even more is that upload to Youtube is not even available from your video gallery...The above plus a few other bugs with this phone and windows 7.8 sure have me to the point of switching back to iPhone where I can enjoy the simple apps that I have used in the past and I would like to continue to use in the future without the problems that Windows phones offer.Oh, and I completely forgot to mention that the sound of this device is a complete mess. Once you plug your headphones the volume goes significantly down, even when it is pumped at 30 out of 30. The max volume of this phone with the headphones on, can compare to about 2-3 bars of the iPhone's volume.Be aware before purchasing this device. If the above issues would not be a big deal for you, this could be a great phone as it has a great built quality.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "Trivikram", "ReviewID": "R1VCUA7PHQX0F0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received the order in time and the product was exactly the same as described in the website.

The last Nokia I'm ever gonna buy. Won't waste time on the 920 it's good but it will be out of order faster than u know it and the customer support sucks in the US", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009LOK8YO"}}
