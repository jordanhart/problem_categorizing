Meeks \"Book Reviews @ Large\"", "ReviewID": "R362LM2SFT1XEY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well I have had an Alias 2 for over 2 years now and I love it, best phone I ever had.  just so you understand I use my phone mainly as a PHONE, I do a lot of txting and it is great for that.  The menus are all clear and it won't pocket dial people.  I would like to point out that some of the early models had a problem with Bluetooth which was resolved with a software fix.  I am looking around to buy an extra for when mine dies since Verizon does not carry them any longer on their website.  The key board is great and I have not found anything that I like better for carrying in my front jeans pocket and I can set it to vibrate AND play any mp3 I wish as a ringtone.  Whats not to like??UPDATE:  Well here I am in Jan 2013 and still have this same phone, still like it and fight the urge to move on to a \"smart\" phone.  Unless you really want a smart phone that will be lucky to get through a 24 hour period without being recharged this is still the best phone.  I have the extended battery and I can go for 3-5 days without a recharge and the coverage is excellent.  Anything I get to replace it in the future will be a step down as an actual phone (which is why we got these things wasn't it?).UPDATE:  It is Oct 2013 and my phone of 4 years was going strong but I dropped it just right to break the front screen (it was still working but looked bad) so I used a Alias 2 backup I had and took it to the Verizon store and got it cloned then bought a factory refurbished Alias 2 (to replace the backup) from one of the vendors on this page for $42, looks new but until they make a smart phone with a physical QWERTY keyboard and a battery that lasts for 3-6 days, I am keeping this phone.  Still better than anything out there IMHO since I have a PC, iPad, laptop I can use to access the Net, I really don't need it on my phone.NOTE:  IF you really want to love this phone, get this with it and you will hate to ever use anything else :)  OEM Samsung U750 Alias 2 Extended Battery & Grey Door SCH-U750 Alias 2", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't need a data plan - You just have to be firm", "Author": "TheFrey", "ReviewID": "R1E3142KNEKNVG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have two Alias2's on verizon (we like them a lot) and none of them have a data plan.

I chose it because (1) it's a Samsung, the brand with which I have consistently had the best luck and fewest problems, (2) it is a \"flip-phone\" design, which I prefer because the screen and keyboard are protected when not in use (usually in my purse or pocket) and I don't have to worry about \"pocket dialing\" someone unintentionally, and (3) I prefer an actual keyboard rather than a touch-screen keyboard.  The reasons I LOVE this phone are all of the above PLUS... I rarely lose a call unless I am in an area that seems to be a notorious \"dead zone\" for everyone, the camera takes fantastic pictures, the available GPS application is so cheap and easy to use, I can access my online email, I keep several \"must have\" games (including Scrabble and Sudoku) on shortcuts for quickest access, mp3 capabilities, and of course... great TEXTING!!!!  The list goes on.  I don't particularly want or need a smart phone and I think that's because I've been so incredibly happy with THIS phone.  I am on Amazon right now, looking for another one, because something seems to have gotten into the slot for the charger so I can't insert it to charge.  I am heartbroken! :o(  I am way past due for an upgrade with my carrier and could probably get a much more sophisticated phone with my upgrade, but I'm just not ready to part with my Alias 2!!  Besides, I have never had trouble finding accessories for my Alias 2 on Amazon (near impossible through my carrier, who only seems to stock parts and accessories for the newer, fancier phones they would rather you buy!).  Bottom line:  LOVE LOVE LOVE MY SAMSUNG ALIAS 2!Additional note, added 8/16/12:I almost forgot one of the VERY BEST things about the Samsung Alias 2... NO \"AUTO-CORRECT!!!!\"  When I get texts from some of my friends and relatives who have phones that are a little newer/fancier models, and the \"auto-correct\" has done anything BUT \"correct\" their text content, I just crack up.  I'll never forget the time my sister texted me that she was going to \"club\" my mother! Lol!  I don't even remember what she later told me she'd MEANT to type.  I \"locked\" that text in my inbox and look at it whenever I need a laugh.  Who decided to call those \"SMART phones\" anyway??", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy to use.

The flip phone slides into my purse, fits my hand and nails, and has the time on the outside. It fits to my face, like a phone should.

Upon ordering it, I then got an Email which stated that my order had been processed and that I should get my cell phone between Dec.20 and Dec.27, well guess what, I checked my mailbox on Dec.17, just 55 hours after I ordered the thing and there it was!!! In my 62 years on this planet, I have NEVER seen service like that! Recently I obtained a new phone upgrade from Verizon called the Cosmos, but I soon becamw very unhappy with it because it was extremely difficult for me to text on it. The QWERTY keyboard keys are way too small. So I logged onto Amazon and ordered a new phone from Wireless4Cheap, and I am  very happy. Wireless4cheap has now got me for life.

Every single key is actually an e-ink display so when the phone is flipped open clamshell-style they're ordered and labelled for use primarily as a phone but when you flip it open sideways they're oriented properly and filled primarily with letters and other keys for messaging. Other reviews are right when they say it'll take you a little bit of time to get used to the phone. Although the key labels change, the layout does not, so sometimes a key seems like it would be more convenient in a slightly different place. The truth is, it would be, but that's the only place to put it when the phone is opened in that orientation. You'll occasionally find minor frustration with the fact that if you read a text with the phone opened clamshell-style that it'll close the message and make you re-open it when you shut it and open the door sideways to respond more easily. These really are minor issues, however, that did not diminish my enjoyment of this phone. Clearly a lot of thought and effort was put into this redesign of the Alias, and though you might worry about the strength and durability of the hinge, I had no problems with our two despite heavy use and having purchased them used with visible wear.Other reviewers are dead-on about the fact that you very much want to buy the extended battery and door. While it makes the phones slightly more bulky, it also allows you to talk and text extensively and still only need a charge about every 5-6 days.http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Alias-Extended-Battery-SCH-U750/dp/B002SL1TSQ/ref=pd_sim_cps_1?ie=UTF8&refRID;=0BJ7255RF1F1A1118W65", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "outstanding phone", "Author": "CHARLES E HIGGINS", "ReviewID": "R20ITQ8479CU2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This my 3 phone, I break my phones at work.

Theres also a keyboard select button that allows you to switch manually.  Wi-Fi would have made this phone damn near perfect.  There are a few things I must complain about.  There doesn't seem to be a windows interface. It's not mentioned in the manual or on the website. Windows 7 recognizes the device when connected but then fails to find drivers or software for it.  Adding files to the phone requires removal of the memory card and attachment to the PC thru a card reader. The interface between the phone and the Memory card could also use a bit of work.  Ringtones seem to only work when downloaded through Verizon.  The device seems incapable of simply accessing them from the card directory.  I've also had problems getting bluetooth to function with other devices, for instance, with my garmin gps I can place calls but once connected I can't transmit voice or keypad entries.  It's a shame Samsung decided to scrap this model and pursue I-Phone replicas.

Personally, I have access to the internet, email, rss, etc all day long so I have no need of a full blown smart phone yet, I do communicate regularly via text msg.  The big issues with my needs are that I absolutely hate phones with keyboards on the outside; the lockouts are a pain and they inevitably find a way to unlock themselves and start dialing no matter what I do. I don't want a large display screen to gather all my finger and facial goo (oh, you have it too, dont fool yourself) and are too susceptible to breakage with my lifestyle--not to mention they take up too much pocket real-estate.  And I don't want to buy a data package which is optional for this phone (verizon).  This phone's dual flip feature is excellent and allows me to use it conventionally or to open it and have a nice, qwerty keyboard running lengthwise.  The e-ink keys switch and flip accordingly so they are always upright.  The one complaint I have is that there is no hot-key for the camera when opened lengthwise but I did assign a hot-key to access that menu--it just takes a few more button strokes to activate the camera function.  You do have to be careful of it when opening one handed, or letting young children play with it.  The dual hinge is the weak link and I can see how it will break with uncontrolled pressure being applied incorrectly.  I plan to keep my eye open for deals on these phones so I have a backup, if/when this one breaks or is lost.  A friend has had this same phone since they first came out and it is still going strong and in good shape.  Proof that it is not as volatile as some reviews might lead you to think.

I had found this out when I recommended it to someone I knew and they told me Verizon wanted to charge $80 a month for a pre-paid plan.I have had this phone for a couple of years and it has held up pretty well. The charger did not though, and broke after about a year of light use. It was very cheap, so I ended up getting Home Wall AC DC Travel House Battery Charger for Verizon Samsung Alias 2 U750 - Convoy SCH-U640 - FlipShot U900 Cell Phone - BestCellBuy Brand, which has worked just as well and shows no signs of falling apart.Pros:- Sturdy phone (I have not dropped it as much as the average person, but it barely has a scratch anyways)- Capabilities of most phones, such as video, music, games, and the internet- Ability to use the phone as a normal flip phone (flipping upwards) or as a texting phone (flipping on the side)- Keypad works well to make texting much faster- Camera works as expected (not too good, but not that bad)- Battery life is pretty decent; it lasts a few days if you use it a bit, and about a week if you do not use it muchCons:- Works sluggish when you have too much information stored (such as having a lot of text messages stored)- Keypad has three separate screens, requiring a button to be pressed to switch to a different keyset in a certain order (switching from letters to numbers, then numbers to symbols, then symbols to numbers, and then back to letters).- MP3 buttons on the front can be pressed when the phone in your pocket. This has resulted sometimes in my phone getting very hot because it is constantly on from these button presses. You have to use the \"lock\" button on the right side to prevent this from happening- Will constantly try to search for service if it is not in a service area, which wastes the battery very quickly (if you go to sleep with it on and it does this, it will drain almost all of a full battery)- Annoying low battery life sound that cannot be muted- Battery tends to get loose sometimes. The phone could be on but will turn off once you close it because the battery might be loose- The phone will sometimes get confused as to what side you flipped it on, so you could flip your phone to the side and it will think you flipped it upwards- Keypad gets hot pretty quickly if you are using it constantlyEven though there are a large amount of problems with the phone, it works pretty well once you know how it works.

I actually really liked it however it did have a slight issue with durability.  I have had 3 Alias 2 phones.  The first one was a random incident which I won't fault the design for.  The second phone seemed to develop a problem where it would shut down when being opened or closed, which isn't good for some one who's job requires being on call 24 hours a day.  The third phone is actually the reason I \"upgraded\" as I went to a Casio Commando so that my fiance could have my Alias 2 due to having broke her phone's external display.  With her, the Alias 2 lasted about 2 months.We both liked the phone because of the texting mode, where the phone opens sideways and offers a full QWERTY keyboard, and opens like a regular flip phone and feels like a regular phone for calls.  I'm not sure if it's a factory or service company choice or not, but it was nice that the ring tones for calls and texts were different to know which way the phone needed to be opened.As far as the durability issues, when exposed to tap water, the phone is useless.  When exposed to deionized water, like most electronic devices it is of course fine.  A past issue I have had with other phones was impact resistance.  The alias 2 seems to be less susceptible to impact or pressure damage, however if a llama steps on it, it's done (not kidding about that one either, that's what happened to my fiance's hand down phone).  One of the unique tests of a phones I suppose was radiation testing.  One of the other employees at the reactor I worked at also had an Alias 2 phone, and decided to upgrade to an I-Phone, and he decided to put the phone in a high gamma and neutron exposure area (we put the phone in the reactor), and although sound quality suffered a little bit, it still worked.  We ran the test for a student project, so we gathered some interesting data, but basically the phone can take 10,000 times the radiation that a human could and survive before the sound quality isn't good enough to interpret.  We tested a few other phones as well as part of the project (all Samsung) and the Alias 2 actually did best.Unfortunately, Samsung no-longer makes the Alias 2 phone.  I would be leery of buying a used one due to the wear issues with the double open design.

When using the phone for the first few days, I found out that it would freeze up. It was completely unusable, and the only way to be able to use the phone was to take the battery out and power it back up in a few minutes.

The internet works but it's not really functional (I cannot do any online banking - not even check my balance). It doesn't do emails. You can't use the USB cord to offload anything - not photos either. If you didn't have the forethought to get an SD card, the only way you can get photos/ videos off the phone is by texting, blu tooth or by sending to an online album through Verizon. The album costs money to maintain more than 75 photos and of course it costs money to get prints, copies or links of your own pictures. I could not get the phone to find our PS3 via blu tooth at all.  The phone will not do anything while it is trying to send or receive, so if you're sending a text and someone is sending one to you at the same time, you have to cancel the action on one to get the other. I have had people send me ringtones and the phone will let me save those ringtones but not send to anyone else. To be able to forward, I have to save the original text I was sent and forward that. And the lowest plan you can get with this phone through Verizon is $79/ month... that's the lowest.

Hellinger", "ReviewID": "R39PRILA5D2RCA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned several flip phones while on T-mobile network and love their usability, low cost, pocketability, voice quality, and battery life. Samsungs have served me well and I thought I might be stepping up from the Samsung T-339 flip phone I had previously used on T-Mobile when ordering this phone to replace my Motorola Droid \"smartphone\" on Verizon network.First and most damning observation is that the signal strength on this phone is inferior to my Droid. Dropped calls in the house (2-3 bars on Droid) and 1-2 bars outside whereas Droid delivers 3-4 bars. I cannot make a meaningful comparison against my other flip phones as they are on a different network, but if you are looking for good signal, this phone doesn't deliver.Second issue is that the interface tries to be \"cute\" with an office or apartment analogue... move your cursor to different parts of the room to access different features of the phone. The reason I was trying to replace the Droid smartphone was to get away from these distractions and back to a sensible menu / icon driven interface; no luck here.Third, i was hoping to pair this phone to either my iPod touch or Samsung Galaxy player (both BlueTooth devices) with no luck. That's all I have to say about that.Fourth, the phone is quite a bit bulkier than other flip phones I have used. Not quite as bad as some of the \"ruggedized\" flip phones still being manufactured, but almost large enough to seem imposing when open and pressed against your face. So a strike against it for pocketability.Fifth, the keys, while interesting in their ability to be re-purposed based upon orientation, don't match up well with the on-screen prompts and their size makes dialing out a bit more tedious. There are no obvious green \"answer\" and red \"hang-up\" buttons, which make it more frustrating when another call comes in while you're on the phone.Sixth, the audio feedback is not much more sophisticated than simple beeps and blips reminiscent of an old computer. Combined with the blocky keys, the phone gives the impression of being a draft or concept design, rather than a finished commercial product.A few other points worth mentioning... there is  a power button on the side of the phone, which seems very likely to be triggered when shoved into a pocket. Also, no wi-fi access on a phone with a feature set that begs for it.Sadly flip phones are being driven to the brink of extinction and the alternative choices are increasingly limited. However much I might despise my \"smartphone,\" I don't consider the Alias 2 a viable replacement for the above reasons.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected and seems to be poor quality", "Author": "Ed Nollet", "ReviewID": "R1QMQ0B3TZ8LSS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone has very small buttons and was shutting down on me when I first got it.

It's a bit of a hassle when you're trying to get a new phone because your old one broke- spending all this time and energy on buying and returning things. I don't want to go on a tirade about the purchase because, like I said, the CS was great and all. Just annoyed about the purchase. I don't generally buy things based on how good the people are when I need to return them, so, there's that.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Did Not Like this Phone", "Author": "S.

How do I even begin?Let me start off by saying that I eschew negativity. It is the bane of modern thinking. The second you get trapped in those bad vibes, you might as well be waist-deep in a vast hole of quicksand, entrapped in Medusa's gaze.Unfortunately, this phone has drawn my eternal ire. We live in a world of technological wonders, of comfort and ease. No one admires the loser who writes poorly of a cell phone--a luxury unheard of for millions and trillions of years. Yet, for Amazon, for cell phone purchasers, for YOU, I will be labeled a loser. It's the right thing to do. It's the American Dream.I had a glorious time owning the LG enV3 (LG enV3 VX9200 Verizon Cell Phone with 3MP Camera, Camcorder, Bluetooth, Stereo music, MicroSD expand to 16 GB, Email (Blue)). It was great. Calling someone? Great. Texting someone? Awesome. Dropping the phone to the ground with the enormous acceleration of 10 m/s/s? Survived every time.Unfortunately, we as humans are inherently mortal...And unfortunately, this basic reality applies to cell phones. I learned this the hard way: I dropped my precious LG enV3 into a cup of water, and after that, he was never the same. I had to let go of him forever....And that's how I ended up with this Samsung Alias 2. My brother had it for a while, but he eventually ditched it for a better model. That should have raised a proverbial red flag in my mind, but hey--I needed a phone, and I wasn't gonna dish out extra money for a new one. And so I kept alive my youthful enthusiasm, my endless optimism. Oh, silly, silly self.The Samsung Alias 2 does, admittedly, have some pretty awesome technology. It can open two ways: horizontally, to yield that ever-so-convenient texting configuration, or vertically, to yield that ever-so-comical taco configuration. Amazingly, the keyboard is lit up and therefore can SWITCH to reflect which configuration you're in. Basically, the keypad is MAGIC and can transform from letters to numbers to symbols. I've definitely gotten many compliments based on the witchcraft involved in the changing of the keypad.False facades are saddening. I discovered many flaws in my Samsung Alias 2; ordinarily, I can look past flaws, but this phone is brought down with several death wishes.1. Simply put, the phone is tough to even open. If I had long nails, they'd probably snap under the extreme dexterity and force needed to jam them underneath the top half for opening. It's a good thing I don't have long nails.2. Checking the time is a hassle. With wrist watches and--even moreso--pocket watches becoming more of a rarity in today's technological world, we have all turned to the humble cell phone to determine the moment's time. For the Samsung Alias 2, you must hold the--fittingly--\"HOLD\" button on the side for a second or two to make the time pop up. What if my life depended on it? Would I want to put that on two seconds' hold?!3. When you open the phone horizontally, it goes on speakerphone mode. Yes, yes, I know; you can change this. However, even if it were not to be on speakerphone, it would be bumbling and awkward to speak to your friends and family in the horizontal mode. When I'm on the bus and all the people have sleek iPhones and Droids, the last thing I want to do is speak to the pizza guy on my bumbling, awkward Samsung Alias 2.4. Sometimes when you switch from horizontal to vertical or vice versa in the middle of a call, you hang up. I don't know about you, but risking the inevitable explanation as to why you hung up on someone is something that I'd love to avoid.5. Texting is quite difficult. I can't text numbers and letters and symbols all at the same time; I have to press this little button in the corner to switch between the three. What if I wanted to use my favorite emoticons, like \":3\" and \":D\"?! Am I forced to use syntax and vocabulary to communicate my deepest, inner feelings? Pshaw.6. When the battery is low, it creates problems. First off, the lit-up and changing keyboard is, as aforementioned, pretty sweet. Unfortunately, once the battery is deemed low, the keyboard fails to light up anymore! It's happened on more than one occasion: it's the dark of night, and my battery goes low. The keyboard doesn't light up, and I'm stuck trying to go off of memory where the keys are! For everyone who I ever texted \"defisjfns dwiujjf\" to, I am sincerely sorry. It was the Samsung Alias 2's fault. SECONDLY, the phone insists on making the spookiest, most bone-chilling beep in the history of Mother Earth when it is low on battery. Think of it as a little baby, crying because he needs a bottle of milk. I can't tell you how many times I've been startled.7. Calls drop a lot. I'm sort of willing to give the phone a pass because it probably is more of the network's fault. Better be.8. It doesn't notify me of new voice mails. I don't know why. It makes me get back to people a month late. This is saddening.In short, this phone is not a bad choice for phone novices or for people who genuinely don't care about any of the issues I listed. Sometimes in this world, we don't like things, but other people do. That is okay. I don't hate the Samsung Alias 2. It's just not right for me.I-I-I'm deeply disturbed by how much I've written on a simple cell phone.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!", "Author": "Paul \"And this is between y'all\"", "ReviewID": "R2PZZYY0G50L6P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is a piece of crap:- For 3 months, it would turn off unexpectedly.
