It has extreme issues, it freezes for no reason, it turns off for no reason, it has issues recharging, it has problems with the battery life. Check the google reviews, seriously, don't purchase this. In two weeks my issues started, and that is when it becomes out of warranty. It is known to be defective. Save yourself the agony of dealing with a product that won't last for even a month.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$119.99", "Features": "Mobile Operating System: Android OS, v2.3.5\nCarrier: T-Mobile\nColor: Not Available\nTouch Screen: Yes\nBuilt-in Digital Camera: Yes", "Name": "HTC Concord Family Mobile Smartphone | T-Mobile", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q5802NnPL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00A3W8K1G"}}
