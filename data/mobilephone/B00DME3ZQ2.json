{"Reviews": [], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "World's First Android 4.2 Tablet Projector with a 7 Inch IPS Screen and an impressive DLP Projection is an awesome and unique design that combines the functionality of a tablet with a cool projector.\nAn ANDROID first is this unique and incredibly designed 7 inch tablet that can actually project what is on the screen. This stylish designed tablet with a powerful built-in DLP projector makes this device a new and inspiring piece of technology that is a world's first, it is known as the \"Vision\". This tablet greets you with a 7 inch IPS (In-Plane Switching technology) screen that is 5 point capacitive meaning it will detect the faintest touch of your finger in numerous areas. The feature that makes this tablet exclusive and standalone is the ability to project what you are currently watching, reading, playing or doing on the tablet against a surface such as a table or wall. By means of DLP (Digital Light Processing) this tablet creates an image by using microscopically small mirrors laid out in a matrix on a semiconductor chip, known as a DMD (Digital Micromirror Device). Each mirror represents one or more pixels in the projected image. The number of mirrors corresponds to the projector's 854x480 resolution and then the mirrors are repositioned rapidly to reflect light through the lens. The \"Vision\" has 40 Lumens but it will feel a lot more and be used more effectively and efficiently than standard LED projection due to using DLP technology as it doesn't require a high volume of lumens to project a great display.\nAs the world's first DLP tablet, the \"Vision\" is capable of projecting images at 40 lumens onto a 50 inch surface for up to three hours, which makes it perfect for business executives or trainers who frequently have to travel. This tablet enables people to forget about carrying their heavy laptops and also pico projectors as the \"Vision\" will allow you to carry all of your presentation tools in your jacket's pocket.\nAt a Glance... \u25feWorld's First Android Tablet with Built-in DLP Projector\nPackage Contents \u25feTablet Projector \u25fePower Adapter (Product Specific) \u25feUser Manual (Product Specific\u25feUSB Cable (Product Specific)  )\u25feOTG Cable (Product Specific)\u25feEU Adapter (Product Specific", "Name": "World's First Android 4.2 Tablet Projector | Cell phone | Mobile Phone | - 7 Inch IPS Screen | Triband Camera | Bluetooth Mp3 Mp4 Player Camera Cell Phone | Bluetooth | Camera | Video Player | Cell Phone Shop | Buy Cell Phone | Latest Cell Phone | Cell Phone Deal | Cell Phone Unlock | New Cell Phone |\u25feProximi \u25feAccelerometer Sensorty Sensor", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eb5EL9h7L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DME3ZQ2"}}
