Other phones with a touch screen are too slippery for me to handle and the buttons on other phones are too small.  This phone has large buttons and grips well when you are searching for it in your bag.  You can't \"butt dial\" or take pictures of your steering wheel which happens with other phones, either.  I like the voice call feature, too, as I don't text and drive.  I have dropped it a few times with no harm done!  The only thing that bugs me is the volume on the side which is too easy to accidentally turn up or down.

I've had mine for two years and it's been through a lot. My son and I both have dropped this phone from high places and he even dropped it in lemonade and most recently the toilet. After a day in a bag of rice, it was good as new.  It has very good reception; I've never had a dropped call. And some will tell you that it's the service and not the phone, but I've had other phones with the same service that dropped calls constantly. I thought it wouldn't recover from the last drop in water, so I got a new phone. Ended up getting a smartphone, but when my contract is up, or if my smart phone dies unexpectedly, I will get another convoy.

Donaldson \"Cal-diver\"", "ReviewID": "R3VFL3XQ0YXVF8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the original Convoy for a little over two years. Battery life was always very good until the past few months. I figured it just needed a new battery so I ordered a very cheap battery online. That one also did not hold a charge very long so I bought yet another battery and still the battery life was short. So I figured the phone was causing the short battery life (about two days) and I needed to get a new phone.I didn't buy the phone from Amazon but wanted to review it so came here to do so.I've always been pleased with the old Convoy with a few quirks that I didn't like. First I've used it in dirty conditions, also on my boat where my hands were wet, and it has worked flawlessly with the exception of the shorter battery life the past several months. When new I would not have to charge the phone more often than about once a week.The little quirks that I didn't like about the old Convoy were the outside buttons would be depressed in my pocket by something like my keys and it would begin to quietly beep every time I moved my leg. I would find it in some mode like playing music. I wish I could disable the external buttons on the face.The old Convoy was also pretty thick. It was okay in my pocket but thinner would be much appreciated. Also the old Convoy had many raised buttons or button like bumps around the edge. Some were functional buttons like the speakerphone, but others were decorative and added confusion.I didn't expect much because I was just looking to replace my old Convoy with a new one that worked like new. Then I found there was this new model. I read up on it a little bit then ordered it. I am pleased with several aspects of the new Convoy 2.Here is what I like about the new Convoy 2.Pros:- The Convoy 2 is slightly thinner and perhaps slightly lighter than the Convoy 1- I believe the volume is much louder on the Convoy 2 than the Convoy 1- The Convoy 2 has a flash for the camera, but it is easily also used as a flashlight.- The little false buttons on the Convoy 1 have been designed out of the Convoy 2- The Convoy 2 uses a standard USB connector for chargingCons:- Both the Convoy 1 and Convoy 2 are quite thick given the wide variety of phones on the market that have similar features and are much thinner.- Strangely the Convoy 2 does not have the two small slots next to the battery cover to help removing the cover.Don't cares:- The camera. I have used it occasionally but I always carry my iPod Touch 5th gen which I use when I want to take photos or videos.- Push To Talk. It might be useful for those on construction sites but even if I had a PTT partner I find those phones annoying when I hear people using them.- Music app. I use my iPod Touch for music.- Internet features. We have the data plan completely disabled on Verizon so we don't occur any extra data charges.I use the phone for a phone. That's all.I was able to copy contacts from the old phone to the new Convoy 2. They supposedly supply a method to do that but it won't work for use because we have disabled internet access. The Contacts list on the old phone could easily be copied to the microSD card from the Contacts menu. However, strangely, the Contacts menu does not allow one to copy contacts from the microSD card back to the phone! But deep in the menu system I was able to find Settings & Tools -> Memory -> Card Memory -> Move All To Phone. I have the crippled Verizon of the phone with Verizon alterations. I don't know what the phone options are if you are on another system besides Verizon.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT an improvement on the Convoy U640", "Author": "Nonie DJ", "ReviewID": "R2LG8XPQXAJTQM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When this phone was released I was hoping for an upgraded version of my beloved Convoy; but the so-called \"improvements\" are not worth the \"flash\" about it. I didn't realize a flash player and flashlight would tax the other features the Convoy1 had(such as the internal memory,music player and the sturdy flip hinge).The more I used the Convoy2, the more I hated it.1. The first thing I noticed was the weak flip hinge. If you pick up a Convoy2 carelessly the phone falls open.The Convoy stays closed no matter how you pick it up.2. The internal memory is pathetic. I kept getting memory alerts on accepting text or pic messages; \"insufficient memory cannot load music\"; \"delete files\"; etc. There was a 16GB micro card in it,too.The Convoy has great memory without a micro card.3. You would think that files and data on a micro sd card would transfer from phone A1 to phone A2, correct? NO THEY DON\"T! The Convoy2 couldn't detect any photos, pics or ringtones on the card at all.The Convoy read pics and music on a micro card from my LG Swift. Not even the same maker. How about that?Overall, the Convoy U660 is a lousy phone without comparing it to the first version due to the flip hinge and memory. Needless to say, I switched back to and still use my Convoy U640!", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Basic Phone", "Author": "Charles \"chaszz\"", "ReviewID": "R1JNSRHHO9U8G6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A good basic phone. I previously rated this phone poorly, but found that my usage of it needed education and improving. Now that I've learned to use it, I like it. Has a handy Micro SD card slot which holds a good deal of music and photos. The music can be downloaded from a PC, and the photos uploaded to it. The camera is not near-professional quality but is pretty good, expecially if the photos are touched up in a Photoshop type program. Shoots videos also. Drawback: the camera and video controls and responses are a little slow.

The buttons on the front and side stick out too far and it continually beeps at you as the buttons inadvertently get pressed and if you use a holster style holder like I do it will drive you crazy. I ended up making plastic pieces the same height as the buttons to go around them and gluing them on so they only get pressed when I deliberately press them. Ringer is loud which is a good option when you work in a noisy enviorment.Software wise it sucks! Especially the texting function, even just simple texting will test your patience. Occasionally the phone will alert me that I missed a call but it never rang, I don't know whether to blame the phone or Verizon for the calls that don't ring. Battery life is good if it doesn't have to keep searching for service, I can go up to 5 days on a charge but I don't use any Internet or music functions either.

We needed the PTT (push to talk) service which limited our options.  The original purchase was in April 2012.  I waited to place this review until I could truly see how these phones worked.  Every single employee that has one of these phones has complained about it.  The \"durablility\" of this phone is inaccurate.Many of the our phones have the \"thumb print\" discoloration on the outside screen as I see others have had as well.  This is just an annoyance and did not hinder the use of the phone unless using the PTT service, which of course is what our guys use 90% of the time. When using the PTT it is difficult to understand the person speaking at times.  The alert sound for PTT is also very low and cannot be set for volume AND vibrate.  This is a negative when someone is running machinery and cannot hear their phone.  Even if it is in their pocket or cliped on their belt, it doesn't vibrate for them to be aware of the call.I have had several phones with speaker problems.  People not being able to hear one person at all, yet that person can hear others fine.The joint is sturdy, so far only a couple have had issues with them.  Only one in which the phone came apart.There have been battery issues as well.  The manufactuer did not have replacements even while the phones were still under warranty.  I had to wait for over six months for a replacement battery for one phone.  Samsung did not supply any to Verizon nor did they have any in stock.  When one finally was available, I had to get it directly from Samsung who said that if there was damage on the one being returned we would have to pay for it.  This was poor customer service.  I will give the representatives at Verizon a good review though.  Every rep that I spoke with did a great job trying to solve the issues.  It is with the phone.We will be replacing these phones as needed with a better PTT phone.

The screen crack was caused by sharing a pocket with keys and it may just be luck that the first one didn't crack from the same reason.  The external buttons are too easily activated (including the \"lock-unlock external keys\" one)and this results in excessive use of battery and unintended annoying sounds/messages. The protective case I bought didn't help this much.I need just a basic phone with GOOD durability and resistance to various forms of minor abuse.  I can't do the physical work I do well if I have to pay frequent and careful attention to babying a phone.  It goes in a front pocket and is sometimes accompanied by other hard items -- usually keys.  All the fancy extras and features matter little if it can't do its primary function -- hassle-free phone calls -- well.

The phone is either in the house on the desk (charging) or in a special place in the car.  We don't walk around with the phone like many folks, doesn't even really get exposed to air much less water.  So when the second quit and we sent it in I got an e mail again that I am being charge $99  (I had insurance on this one with a $99 deductible they said) because there is water damage and corrosive.  After checking the internet I see many many folks in this same boat including some with Samsung Droids (i.e. Galaxy).  In any case we are at our wits end.  Don't know what to do. Have written to Samsung (no response yet) but I do believe any future phone will not be a Samsung.  Not sure if other makes are doing this but I know for a fact this phone is.Follow Up.

I selected the phone because it was advertised as \"built to strict military specs to resist almost anything you can throw at it - shock, extreme temperatures, dust, humidity and more.\" A little over a month after I bought it, I pulled it out of my pocket to discover that the outside screen was displaying a yellow-orange blob, making most of the display unreadable.  Samsung customer support told me to send the phone in for warranty repair, which I did.Two weeks later I received an email from Samsung customer support claiming the phone is \"Out of Warranty\" and I would need to pay Samsung three times what I paid for it to have the phone repaired.  The Samsung customer service rep told me that the advertisement on samsung.com was really a third party, and these claims they are making don't apply to the whole phone, as the advertisement says.  The warranty doesn't cover anything that happens to the phone (anything you can throw at it - shock, extreme temperatures, dust, humidity and more).  In other words, even under normal usage, Samsung is unwilling to honor its one year warranty.Besides the poor reliability, it has some annoying design flaws. The phone doesn't allow you to immediately lock the external keys automatically, so I've sent a few annoying pocket texts and have the phone continuously beeping in my pocket because they don't lock out right away. The texting is kind of jumpy - the response time for hitting some keys is slower than for others keys. Mildly annoying. The calendar erase functions are poorly designed such that you don't know if you are erasing all the events on a particular day or for all days. I accidentally blew away all my appointments because of this design flaw.There are better choices out there.

The alarm clock fails at least one in every every 5 times it comes around. The battery is fairly reliable.Anyone who liked the Convoy-1 should not expect the same from the Convoy-2. Samsung had a winner for the working person but turned it into a wimp. I hate saying this because I loved my Convoy-1... and am very disappointed in the Convoy-2.
