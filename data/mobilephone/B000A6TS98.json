This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.  I noted one user complained about battery life and also noted they seem to be using it a lot in weak signal area.  This is a trimode phone that may flip to analog mode in a weak area.  If that happens, any analog phone will suck the battery dry in no time.  they should configure the phone to prevent flipping to analog mode.I wanted analog because there is a large section of backwoods Texas that has the old GTE analog service still present.  The rest of the time, I am around big cities and strong digital network presence. I travel all of the US in my job and use the phone everywhere.  My previous phone was a VX4400 which had some bugs. This phone is everything the VX4400 should have been, plus it has a very loud ringer, vibrator, and one of the better speakers I've heard on a cell phone.I love the small size and light weight. This phone was acquired on a \"new every two\" plan.  I originally got the VX6100 and found that it was more cumbersome, had shorter battery life and a tinny sounding speaker.  I had no use for the camera, so traded back for the VX3300. My wife has had the VX3200 for over a year and she loves it.  This is the latest re-incarnation of the VX3200.I purchased the mobile office kit and it works well with this phone. I've used Verizon digital network service with my PC for two years and its been a real boost when I am in the airport and need to do some email without having to pay extra.One of these days I'll have a blackberry or treo when my company will let me hook it into our corporate email system.

I'm a phone abuser, and when it comes to cheap phones, they never last long. Until recently I was using a very cheap Motorola, and it could not stand up to my abuses. I finally switched to this phone, and I must say, I'm very happy.I've never felt the need for a camera phone, interchangable faceplates, downloading ringtones, or even playing games on my phone. Voice-activated dialing and text-messaging have been things I like to use, and this LG is great for them.The huge colour display is a plus. I've never liked squinting at a tiny, monochrome LCD display -- like I said, cheap phones. The display is easy to read, and very bright; you can even use it as a flashlight. The buttons are easy to read and easy to press. I have no trouble dialing or answering calls.The features on this phone are also excellent, albeit limited. I use the calandar function all the time, and it's simple and easy to write down appointments and dates to remember. The alarm is clear and loud, louder than my alarm clock next to my bed. The speakerphone is also great. It's loud, crisp, and no one has trouble hearing me on the other end.While I've never been a fan of interchangeable faceplates, the LG doesn't disappoint me. I use the one in the picture because I'm too lazy to actually buy a new one, but the ones LG offers are great.Overall, this is an excellent phone: easy to use, sturdy, and stylish.", "Date": "January 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "not as good as the 3200 it replaces!", "Author": "Michael Franz", "ReviewID": "R3VH6O6BCC1LPH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We had 4 of the 3200 on a family plan, but recently one of them got lost and I had to buy a replacement. Alas, the great 3200 wasn't available anymore, so I got this one instead. Still a good phone, but not nearly as good as the phone it replaces.First, for reasons I don't understand, LG removed the charger jack. You now have to charge the phone through the accessory connector, which means that you probably are going to keep the rubber cover for that connector permanently off the phone or it becomes tedious. This is a real step back.Second, the phone has lots of additional silly ringtones, but far fewer \"normal\" rings. I assume that they are trying to position the phone specifically as a \"kid and teenager\" phone and try to discourage adults from buying it. Guess what: I used to have a camera and web-capable phone, but I purposefully downgraded to the 3200 because I wanted a no-frills phone with a built-in speakerphone.If my phone gets lost or breaks, and Verizon doesn't have an adequate phone by then to replace it, I will proably rather change service providers than buy a \"kid spec\" phone or one of the humungous clunky camera/web/video gizmos that they currently target adults with.", "Date": "July 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "Simple and elegant...", "Author": "S.

It has most of the functionality that you expect from a basic phone: speakerphone, silent ringer.  Internal display can be seen in sunlight, speakerphone is excellent, ringer is loud.  The phone is sturdy.  It fell many times and still works.  The only problem which I think is serious is that the battery is horrible.  I bought 2 phones from verizon.  First phone needed to be recharged every 18 hours the other could live for 2 days if you do not use the phonr.  I brought the first phone to verizon but they said that 18 hour stand by time was good for the phone.  After some alot of whining on my part they switched my battery and they turned out to be right.  I experienced no change in battery life.  Now one year into my contract I had to get used phones from my friends because both of my phones could not be taken of the recharger.  Also it has poor signal reception (maybe because it does not have retractable antennae)  It does not have battery eating extras like camera, bluetooth, mp3 player.", "Date": "November 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "It's a one-year throwaway phone", "Author": "Douglas A. Greenberg", "ReviewID": "RIMNMSE83N8KV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If I had reviewed this phone within the first few months of getting it, I would have given it a very positive writeup. It's compact, ergonomically well-designed, and it performs well in terms of signal sensitivity and sound clarity. It was fun adding a few new ringtones (though there is not a whole lot of choice available for this model), and the removable, changeable face plates made customizing the phone possible.However, after about ten months the battery life began to deteriorate. If the phone is not used the fully charged battery will discharge in about a day (formerly it lasted several days).  Talking on the phone drains the battery so quickly that I cannot hold a conversation for more than about ten minutes without plugging in the phone (not terribly practical for a supposedly \"mobile\" phone).  I purchased an a new battery and the problem continued, so one can only conclude that the circuitry of the phone is at fault.I am not even close to my \"free replacement phone\" opportunity with my carrier (Verizon), so I either have to tough it out with a phone that can't hold a charge, or else I have shell out big bucks for a replacement phone.  This is not a happy situation.  I really think that the makers of these phones assume that you will destroy, lose, or tire of the phone quickly and move on to a new one, so they not made to last.

I had to decide between the VX 3300 and the VX 6100, so my review is mainly a comparison between these two LG tri-mode phones.Call quality (subjective): Good, though is a bit \"tinny\" - LG VX 6100 sounds the same.Speakerphone: Loud, works great, no distortion. Speakerphone will not work with phone closed (same for all LG phones), something that other cell phones do provide.Battery Life: Good. With moderate use loses 1 bar in a day, lasts 3 to 4 days without any charging in between. Conforms to specs.Battery definitely lasts longer than the VX 6100 mainly because the latter has a camera that can be activated through side buttons by mistake.Reception: Call quality is good, even within buildings (1 to 2 bars). LG VX 6100 has same reception as this phone, even within buildings.Features:-- This phone comes minus any bells and whistles. No camera.  Less \"normal\" ringtones (mentioned by other reviewers)than VX 6100.-- Charging Port cover: The small rubber cover for the charging port is something that can be easily misplaced. That said, most phones (Verizon or otherwise) do not cover the charging port so this is not a problem.-- Upgrade from VX 3200: The only difference between this model and the VX 3200 is the 8 MB flash memory upgrade and less normal ringtones. Sturdy construction exactly like other LG phones.-- Voice dial works, though takes some getting used to.-- Can leave voice memos, has calendar, usual scheduling features-- Color Screen: Almost impossible to see in daylight. Gets washed out just like the VX 3200. Color screen on VX 6100 is much better and is visible in daylight (docked 1 star for it).-- VX 6100 has external LCD to tell you who's calling. This would be a nice feature in the VX 3300, but not one that I personally miss. The VX 3300 can be set to answer on the first key pressed, you can see who's calling by opening the phone.

This in spite of having \"Can you hear me now?\" Verizon as my carrier. It really gets to you after a while that you cannot carry on a decent conversation when your phone shows you have a signal, albeit a weak one.Another annoyance is that if you get a missed call, you get a notification that you had a missed call, and then you have to choose whether to view or to ignore. Now, you can ONLY choose this using the OK button. You can't use what the most logical button for this is, which is the left navigation control. Besides, it only shows the missed call number, it does not give you any information about what time that call was missed. One would think that this is at least somewhat important, especially if you're a professional using this as a primary source of communication.And oh, I must clarify that you should not give the phone a benefit of doubt because I might have just received a damaged or poor quality handset that's leading to the dropped calls or poor battery life, since I had ordered two phones for a family plan and both behave exactly the same.", "Date": "September 2, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000A6TS98"}}
