{"Reviews": [{"Title": "E71 truly spoiled me", "Author": "E. polus \"e.p.\"", "ReviewID": "RECY04T1QSC4S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a Nokia E71 (which was an unbelievable upgrade from my previous experiences with Blackberry), and for some reason I was expecting that same leap from the E71 to E72. However, I soon realized, after using my E72 for the past couple days, that the E71 did in fact spoil me. The E72 is still no doubt an amazing phone -- along with the E71 and other top Nokias, it's still in its own little league above the Blackberries and other smartphones -- but I'll admit I was slightly let down.If you are looking to buy a Nokia (or any phone) I'd definitely recommend the E72. If you are a huge Nokia fan, then fine, upgrade. If you're happy with your E71....then I'd really think about it (or at least get your hands on one in person). The E72 is much faster, the camera's awesome, and it's still a beautiful phone. BUT you should know a couple things:-The construction is not quite as top-notch as the E71. It's a little lighter, with some metal replaced for a sort of heavy, hardened plastic. I've heard of the battery panel being loose, but I haven't run into the problem. Mine was made in China, while my E71 was made in Finland, although it seems there can always be problems no matter where it's made.-The optical pad is a nice touch (it takes some getting used to) and, occasionally, it can misinterpret your choice to click to the side for a sliding movement. But overall I'm getting used to it (and if you really don't like it you can always switch it off).-I do notice the slightest high pitched buzz when the volume is turned up and the sound coming from the other end of the call is on the loud side. The E71 never had this problem. I take it the speakers were either downgraded or because of the extra plastic there's some sort of vibration (could just be my model). UPDATE: Seems the speaker just needed some \"breaking in\" (strange, I know). This problem is no longer present. However, still not the best volume in speakerphone mode.***Overall, I'd say if you're looking at the E72 compared to any top smartphone, this is an excellent choice***IF you're looking at the E72 and E71 side by side, it is THEN that you start to notice the little details that I mentioned above. True, there are a few more plastic pieces than the E71, but when I think about the Blackberries and iPhones, you're never going to get the same quality you got with the E71, and the E72 is just a notch below that.E72 is a 4.5 star phone. E71 will always be the best phone I've ever owned.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "A review by a hardcore E71 user. Is it worth the upgrade?", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2P1K8BKJ05ERZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "With one word: NO.After owning and E71 for over a year, which for me was by far the best phone that I have ever used, I was really excited about getting the new E72 since it featured a 600Mhz CPU which seemed to be my main and only issue with the E71. However the CPU was the only upgrade in this unit and almost everything else seemed to be in fact a downgrade. As mentioned by another reviewer this phone has serious stability issues. The FP2 OS is extremely buggy and crashes, reboots and freezes several times a day. Nokia really needs to work on a new firmware to correct this. Below is every quality of the phone that I could think of as compared to the E71.HARDWARE-----------------------------BUILD QUALITY: Definitely not as solid of a feeling compared to the mostly metal E71. The D-pad feels like cheap plastic and it has some free play. The back cover tends to move occasionally when you are holding the phone to your ear.SPEAKERPHONE: Very poor quality compared to the E71. There is very noticeable buzzing near the maximum volume, even with high quality music files. Calls on speakerphone at max volume are plain annoying due to the buzzing. On top of that the speaker is not as loud as the one on the E71.CALL QUALITY: Excellent call quality except at the maximum volume where the call speaker also becomes distorted.KEYBOARD AND TOUCHPAD: The keyboard feels slightly better than the one on the E71. The buttons seem to give out somewhat of a better feedback. However the E72 is slightly wider than the E71 which makes it a little harder to type on with one hand. The new track pad navigation provides a very inconsistent performance and it is not even close to the one on the newer blackberries. Scrolling up and down is perfectly fine but scrolling sideways becomes an exercise. The good news is that the original directional pad like on the E71 is still there so you can just disable the touchpad if you hate it just as much as I did after a week of usage.CAMERA: It is still a cell phone camera so keep your expectations low. It takes decent pictures and the quality is about the same as the E71 but with 5 megapixel images and slightly wider lens. The camera application now has built-in panorama mode. Video at 640x480 is plain horrible. The flash on this phone is actually pretty decent. One thing that was very annoying to me is that it uses a very bright focus light(AKA The flash) which makes focusing at macro impossible if you are trying to take a picture of something with brighter colors that reflect more light. There is no way to disable the focus light either, not even in macro mode. Nokia should think about this as well.BATTERY LIFE: There is simply nothing like it. Except the E71. The battery life on the E72 is also exceptional. I am able to get 2 to 3 days of very heavy usage on it, including 2 to 3 hours of talking, 2 hours of browsing and some text messaging. I have not seen any other phone in this category which gets even close to these stats.GPS: Works great and it gets a position fix generally within 5 seconds. It seems a little faster than the E71. The E72 also has a compass.SOFTWARE-------------------------This is the bad part.FP2: Aside from unifying various internet connections I really did not see much if any of an improvement in this version of the Symbian OS. In fact it features some ugly menu transitions and it has a lot of stability issues. You would get out of memory error with a subsequent freezing at least a couple of times in a day and reboots and total freezes which require battery removal are not uncommon either.APPLICATION UNLOCK: Yes, the phone is hackable with HelloOX 2 and up.WEB BROWSER: The browser is definitely improved from the E71 afar as rendering and navigation goes. However I was never able to complete even ONE single browsing session without this thing crashing and just exiting in the middle of something. It would have been great if it did not crash.E-MAIL: About as bad as the client available on my first T-Mobile Pocket PC with Windows Mobile 2002. Although that one was a little better than what Nokia has provided. It is almost 2010 and Nokia still does not have an e-mail client which supports in-line HTML. The Nokia messaging software and service is plain horrible. After 3 days of usage I just cancelled my account and went to using webmail. It is really that bad and this is unacceptable for a supposed \"business\" device. As an alternative, I would recommend Emoze. Their software even partially supports in-line HTML. If you have Hotmail, you can download Windows Live for Symbian. It works really well.PODCASTING & INTERNET RADIO: Missing!!!???! Very disappointing.SIP CLIENT: Missing!!! The SIP settings are there, but there is no client. So forget about gizmo or any similar service unless you are using a third party client like Nimbuzz or Fring.OFFICE APPLICATIONS: This is one positive category. Quickoffice features a free upgrade to open and edit Office 2007 documents. Nokia has also added Wpresenter, Multiscanner and Font Magnifier as standard applications.--------------------Overall the E72 is a mixed bag for me. It delivers on speed and the browser is well improved but the stability issues, missing software and some other quirks make this device seem like a downgrade. If I was aware of these issues it is likely that I would have stayed with the E71. So if you are in doubt, my advice would be save your money or at least wait for a firmware update which fixes the stability issues.

Parrish \"payparrish\"", "ReviewID": "R35MJCNEFUWFKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The E72 is one of the best phones ever created.... I am a proud owner of tons of phones and tons more over the last 10 years. The Nokia E72 is a beast.... and I save that category for the rarest of gadgets. Let me explain why (briefly).Right now I have an Iphone 2g, Ipaq 910, Bold 9700, and the E72. All of my phones serve a purpose in my ever changing lifestyle.The Iphone is probably the best pda device ever made- emails, sms, mms (now), apps, shortcuts, games, and ease of use. But its still lacking, to me, in various areas- lagging, running multiple apps, camera quality, and battery. Most importantly, I hate going in and out of apps- when closed its closed.The Ipaq 910- is probably one of the worst devices ever purchased; yet when running, its the king of pocketpc's. It was tethering at speeds of 10.2 almost 3 years ago. Now everyone is trying to include 3.5g speeds. Sadly, the battery life sucks and it crashes more than a toddler on training wheels. I still have it and refuse to part ways.The BB 9700 is hands down bb's best effort to me; I would say its the best mobile device on the market. I even added the droid interface and the droid ringtone to spice it up. The track ball is gone and the track pad is even more addictive. It now has a 624 processor and all the bells and whistles, needless to say the best email system going. However, I just get bored with it. I cant figure it out.Now E72 is my second Nokia... I bought the N97 in June but the price wasnt worth keeping. Nonetheless, it was a quality device. I read about the E72 recently and fell in love with the specs.Pros-Battery life- is unbelievable! None of the aforementioned phones can last a day without dragging out a car charger or a wall charger. The E72 can last 2 days with running: emails, taking pics, creating videos, tons of sms,  apps, and tons of phone calls.Camera- is great. I love the quality of the 5mp pictures. The quality changes at night I might add. I almost forgot the front facing camera too.Phone quality- unbelievable calls...with headphones, bluetooth, or device calls.sms- sure its not threaded sms but there are programs that can change the UI if needed.Operating system- yes its outdated but its solid as a rock...I will take that all day long. Whats worst than having no phone? A phone that crashes... the symbian 60 is like a old BMW, period.Track pad/clicker- track pad is not as good as the bb but combined with the usual Nokia E series clicker pad make a great combination.Web Browser- excellent.. The best in its class.Video Calling- recently Fring added skype video calling... I was blown away.Audio messenging- every now and then when I am in a hurry I like to record audio messages oppose to sms...great addition.Contacts, calendar interface- its smooth...if you can marry with google sync...its even better.tethering- no need to purchase a program, it does it for you. You can even add a 3rd party program to make it a hotspot....3.5g- its the fastest phone its class... and if you can buy it unlock, you can take advantage of the various network speeds. No need to buy wifi while traveling.3.5mm headjack outlet- I ran my jbl desktop speakers and last.fm... unbelievable.Nokia Office is a great program with Office and Pdf capability...GPS with OVI maps is superb... now that its free, its a must have with any Nokia.OTA upgrades,no more using the usb port to upgrade....Cons-*Email interface is cumbersome... but now that there is Nokia Email, its a lot better. However, I added Seven push email and its comparable to having BB push service.*Email Links from Browser- I hate that I cant email a friend a good article from a website... maybe I am missing it some how.*Nothing is in alphabetical order...when changing apps... Most are all over the place.*LED flash is on the keypad not the top...I kinda miss the blackberry flashing light.*On screen function icons too small-like sending a text or email, alarm, and bluetooth... are too small and if you need to know if a email is sent, you have to pay close attention to the sent icon or check the outbox...*Must use signed aps if not, you can forget it unless you spend hours trying to get it signed...*Usb jack and phone charger jack different....Overall I still say this is the best gadget phone out...its a thinking mans phone because a lot of the capabilities are hidden and require work. However, once you have mastered it, you have a mp3 player, an entry level 5mp hotshot, great phone, pda, pocketpc, video camera, great gps, social networker (Nokia Facebook and Twitter Gravity, video caller, and a hotspot.I highly recommend the Unlocked version oppose to ATT bloatware crasher versions....", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best phone i have ever used.", "Author": "Manish Singh", "ReviewID": "R36P8NK0IGJCA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was waiting for this phone since last 6 month after it was announced in Singapore. I had E51 and wanted to upgrade to a QUERTY business phone. I liked E71 and when i was about to buy e71 I found the news of E72.I was one the first few to purchase this for  almost 450$, But i am very happy with it till now. The features i liked most are1. The digital compass. This is the most essential hardware/software you require if you really want to use GPS.2. The Optical nav pad, This makes the scrolling really easy and enjoyable.3. The latest 600 Mhz processor which makes it the best performing mobile.4. The camera, finally Nokia's cameras are going to be useful. (I never liked Nokia's camera quality).5.

The host of all the E series features.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent smartphone with a very professional look", "Author": "Sree K", "ReviewID": "R1TQUJ3XUI90GZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Coming from a Windows mobile phone (HTC tilt), I love this phone. I have been considering the Tilt2, but wanted to try something other than a WinMo (I didn't find myself using a lot of WinMo features/apps that called for another similar one). iPhone was out of question as I wanted tethering, better battery life and dedicated keyboard. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and liking it more day by day. Few things before moving to Pros and Cons of the phone - This phone is not for people that like simplicity of touch screen phones (like iPhone). There is a learning curve in using this phone's features and the shortcut keys. But, imo once familiar with the functions/shortcuts one can do things a lot faster than a touch screen phone.Pros****1. Looks sleek and professional. Call quality is excellent and plenty loud.2. Keyboard feels very good even though the keys are slightly smaller. They have a nice feedback when pressed.3. Shortcut keys! There are quite a few shortcut keys on QWERTY keyboard to control phone functions and inside applications. While this feature has a learning curve, I found it very useful once learned.4. Snappy performance. Very fast and responsive.5. OVI MAPS for Free! - this is simply awesome. Now you can have a GPS with maps for as many countries as you need, for free!. Below is a mini review for this feature to explain it better.  a. The GPS locks on the position very fast while using A-GPS. Most of the time within 10-15 sec I have a lock on the signal.  b. GPS interface is very good and user friendly (I have used the latest Garmin and Magellan).  c. Features include lane assistance, auto zoom in/out based on turns/directions, voice guidance, Speedometer, 2D/3D maps, route overview etc.  d. The map size while getting driving direction is a bit smaller on E72, due to smaller screen. Pretty much only 2x2 inch space is used to show the  map and rest is used for other information. It might look better on Nokias with larger touch screens. In spite of this, the auto zoom in/out makes it  easier to view the map details.  e. I compared it side by side with my Magellan and found it to be pretty accurate. E72 was faster in getting the signals (perhaps due to A-GPS)6. Wifi - Works wonderfully and connects to my home network with WPA2 security without any problems. Once connected, I can turn off scanning to save battery Life7. Screen is very bright and readable in direct sunlight.8. Battery life - I can wait for 3 days (may be 4 if I wait for the phone to die on me) before I have to connect it to charger. I use Push emails (18 hrs a day) and stay connected to my home wireless network most of the time and occasional use of phone for talking. Even with heavy use I expect it to last at least for 2 days.9. 3.5mm headphone jack10. Comes with a 4GB micro SD card.11. Decent 5MP camera and nice outdoor photo quality. Indoor photos are just OK (most cellphone cameras are the same).Cons****1. Screen resolution is not great when compared other similar type phones (E.g. Blackberry bold). Would have been nice to have higher resolution on such a bright screen2. Speaker phone volume is not loud enough3. Mail for Exchange - The version on phone is not bad, but it could be better. This is the only application that runs slow on this phone. It takes good few secs for it to open a mail. As it does not load the mail in HTML format automatically, the readability suffers. I had to scroll 2-3 pages to read a few liner mails. Got Roadsync (version 5) for discounted price from OVI store and loving it. It addresses all the problems with Mail for Exchange.4. Optical trackpad is not very useful (even after setting sensitivity to high). I found using the D-pad quicker.5. Micro USB connector and shortest cable - the USB cable that came in the box is approx 7inch long. For such highly priced phone it would have been nice if Nokia included a good quality longer cable. Also, I would have preferred a Mini USB instead of Micro. Micro USB feels a bit fragile and I feel like I might break it if I'm a bit careless when connecting. Perhaps, the thinner case was a limitation to include a mini USB.The phone crashed only once till date and that was when using the Mail for Exchange. I blame it on the application for the crash and not the S60 platform. Browsing experience is not as great a touch screen phone/phone with larger screen.

This review is from the perspective of a first time Nokia smartphone user who previously owned Blackberry and Windows Mobile devices. Compared to my previous phones, this one is definitely more responsive. I rarely ever wait for menus to pop up or applications to open. Also, I am big on multitasking, which Nokia does very well. I agree that Symbian requires some time to get used to, but the shortcuts really help. For example, switching applications by holding down the home button is great for multitasking.The phone itself is sleek and feels good in the hands. It has some weight to it so that it does not feel \"plasticky\". The thin form factor makes it easy to carry in the pocket. I'm not going to deny it, the light leak does bother me. It is something I am willing to live with, though, because this phone still looks better than the others in the market. The optical nav pad depends purely on personal preference. I find myself switching between the optical and physical button depending on the task. The optical pad is functional. I just find it a bit slow when scrolling down a web page. And Nokia really dropped the ball in making the surrounding D-pad button too high. It makes scrolling optically uncomfortable as you are constantly hitting the edge of the physical button. I really like how the notification light surrounds the D-pad. The white light looks good on the black phone. Much better than having a separate red LED in the corner of the phone. Now, if only that can switch colors...Call quality is good and I have no had any dropped calls. The one complaint is that the speakerphone is not loud enough. Email on the Nokia is also surprisingly good despite the bad reviews. I feel that it is as much as \"push\" email experience as the BB. Setup was pain free even for the casual user. I also like how you do not have to open the html version unless you choose to do so using the link on the top of the email. The one thing I miss from the BB is not being able to get all my email accounts and SMS in one folder. Nokia should really consider that. Also the copy and paste feature is not as good as the BB. I still cannot copy text while reading an email. I have to choose reply so that I can get to edit mode before copying. If somebody knows a trick, please let me know.The Symbian interface is still relatively old-fashioned and boxy. However, that also means it looks less like a toy. I like how the home screen shows the calendar items and to do list. When on the Blackberry, I had to sift through hundreds of themes to find one that accomplished this task. In terms of apps, I still find that the Symbian apps are a step behind the other platforms. At least in the US. I find A LOT of apps out there, but the quality falls short. For example, the Bloomberg app was much more functional on my Blackberry. The Symbian version is just awkward, with no easy way to refresh the data. Nokia does score with Ovi Maps, which is easy to use and very efficient. Hopefully, Symbian won't die out and people will continue developing apps for it.I cannot say much about the camera as I like using real cameras for my pictures. I took a few as test shots and they came out pretty good. The shutter is responsive, but the flash is slow. When taken in good light, the pictures were crisp with good color. Low light pictures were noisy as expected.I hope this review gives readers an idea of the usability of the Nokia E72. I admit some compromises were made to switch from my Blackberry, but overall, I am enjoying my experience with the new phone. I think productivity will increase as I gain experience on Symbian. The responsiveness and appearance of the phone really won me over. Plus I cannot stand carrying the same piece of plastic as everyone else.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good, but not ready for prime time.....", "Author": "James H. Schaeffer \"hexman\"", "ReviewID": "R26BOTAXU5QHBX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A little background first. I have used Nokia phones since 1998 and found them reliable and virtually indestructible. I decided to move to a smartphone, no Nokia models were available. My first smartphone ran winmo. It would constantly freeze up and battery life was horrible. I then got a Palm Centro and loved it! It had it's own problems (would reboot randomly and the build quality wasn't great) but overall it was a good little phone. After about 17 months it failed and I couldn't upgrade using my plan. I purchased a unlocked Nokia E63 and was back in the Nokia fold. Build quality was great. When the E72 was announced I decided to go for it. The first reviews from the blogs and tech sites were glowing so I felt good about ordering it. Then the user reviews started....Build quality problems and the \"made in China\" complaints made me doubt my decision. Along with other problems.... I received my E72 a little over a month ago and was disappointed in the build quality, especially the loose battery cover. In fact, I went to check out the Blackberry Bold 9700 which was on sale for $89 (after rebate)at Best Buy Mobile. I wasn't impressed with it's build quality either though. Also I was afraid of the AT&T; cripple ware that would probably be installed. So I decided to give the E72 a try. I installed my sim and booted up. Push email installed flawlessly and worked great. I suffered none of the problems other users were reporting. I figured I had lucked out and had gotten a \"good\" one. After a week the loose battery cover settled in and while still not a perfect fit,it was no longer loose. Then week 3 happened...The first problem occurred while attempting to place a call. The phone would let me dial a number but the call would not complete. Of course I figured it was the (AT&T;) network. I then realized I couldn't send text messages either. I did a \"soft\" reboot and that fixed the problem. A couple of days later, I got the dreaded \"space bar doesn't work\" problem. Again, a soft reboot fixed this problem. The next day while using the browser, the phone rebooted on its own. Today I got the \"buzzing/squeal\" problem while talking. Yet again, a restart solved the problem.In my opinion for what it's worth, I think Nokia released this phone in time for the holiday season without the proper quality control. All of these problems can be fixed by a firmware update. The N900 got one today so hopefully the E72 will receive one soon.I apologize for the long winded review.

Lower quality construction as its predecessor", "Author": "Moy Azabache \"Le Mou\"", "ReviewID": "R2X1H9LATI7NPG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a very happy with the upgrades for this phone, the OS interface is neater vs E71 and the Nokia Messanging service makes a breeze the email setup for most common services as hotmail, yahoo, gmail and so on. The 3.5 mm headphone makes the phone useful as an alternative source for your music and radio, since  you dont have to use the crappy set that comes with the phone, and use your favourite without worrying about carrying on the adapter. Chat services, as well as facebook and youtube apps work without any problems.For me, this phone never crashed as other users have stated, perhaps they just have to update the firmware with ovi suite, which is replacing all the stand by itself nokia services. This makes the syncing of your contacts, agenda, mapas, routes, very easy, since all of them are stored on one account as that one of your mail and its free.The maps work great, the positioning service that nokia uses as alternative to the GPS, make the position acquisition very fast, like google maps. Also the compass makes easier the map reading, if you are not an scout.The accelerometer has a few use with the phone, but a 3rd party app can take advange of it.I'm giving four stars because although the keyboard has upgrades like direct shortcuts for BT, light, most common special characters, etc, the general construction, except by the battery cover is not like the metallic body of the E71. I'm not saying this means a less resistant body, in fact is lighter due to this, and less prone to be dented on a fall, but the aesthetics are better on the E71 with its full elegant metal body. It's also fair to say that the brushed aluminium front is less prone to fingerprints, oppositte to that of the E71.I'm happy with the purchase and compared with another nokia phones as some other from different manufacturers is an excellent option to choose from.", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia E72-Does almost everything", "Author": "A.

The iPhone data/voice plan is to expensive with AT&T; and I could not find a good Android QWERTY phone (not interested in touch screen or keyboard slider phones).  I looked at the E71/E71x and the camera was sub par and disliked the non-standard headphone jack.  Enter the E72.  The phone is simply awesome.Major pros:Camera/Video-takes great pictures and videos.  More like an early 5mp digital camera, less like a cell phone.Stability-The phone flat out works well.  It only takes a few moments to power on and it is rock solid.  My old Blackjack II (Windows Mobile 6.1) crashed and burned at least once a day.GPS/Ovi Maps-The GPS takes about 10 seconds to get a lock, even inside my house.  Free lifetime Ovi maps!  Voice guided turn by turn directions (can even use different languages or accents).  It took 5 minutes for GPS to fire up on my Blackjack II.Reception-has a signal in places where my old phone had no service.WiFi-Very good wifi radio; grabs a signal when needed and after a few moments you are surfing the internet.Display-24 bit display can be seen during the day.Symbian OS-There is a learning curve to it, but once you figure it out it makes sense.Looks/Build-The phone feels substantial in your hand and is well built.  I like the added touch of the stainless steel battery cover.Battery Life-Yes! A smartphone that doesn't have to be charged everyday!  I can go at least a couple of days on a charge and during that time be listening to mp3's, surfing the internet and checking e-mails. power to spare (be warned if you are using wi-fi and/or using bluetooth for extended times the battery does drop much faster).Nokia Internet Radio-now included with the phone.  Listen to thousands of stations around the world for free.Flash Lite support-can watch You Tube videos using native browserMajor Cons (none of them deal breakers for me)No threaded text messaging.  I do miss thisNo native support for Windows Media Streaming for video or audio (problem solved by purchasing Kinoma Play, which is an awesome product)No native Divx supportNot a lot of native customizing options out of the boxThe supplied USB cable is only 8\" long-glad I have a laptop!Speakerphone and earpiece could be louderDifficult (but not impossible) to multitask while on a call, examples bringing up your contacts or reading a text messageCan slow down or get unstable with apps it doesn't seem to like; downloaded Fring and Auto We-Fi from the Ovi store and the phone started hanging and locking up; deleted them one at a time and the phone went back to normal (no loss with the programs, I did not like them much anyway).I recommend this phone to anyone looking for a QWERTY bar phone.  It is second to none.Added bonus if you have AT&T;:  This phone is not classified as a smartphone at AT&T; (they don't sell it).

There are no wobbly parts (not even the battery cover which people complain about). There is some light leakage on the the upper 'functionality' keys and it is distracting. All Nokia E72's have light leakage here. The Micro SD and USB covers are easily damaged, so you need to be careful when you pry them open. I have not broken these but I can tell that they can snap off easily. But in the end, the build quality on the E72 is very nice and sturdy. The screen also comes with a pre-installed screen protector that can be pealed off.2) Efficiency - This phone does not disappoint in making yourself more productive. The phone is very fast compared to Nokia N95, Nokia E90, and Xperia X1. The back-lighting on the QWERTY keyboard has the perfect brightness. It is much brighter than the Nokia E90's dim keyboard. Because the keyboard lacks a number row and needs larger keys, the Nokia E90 or Touch Pro2 is a better choice if you really need a really good keyboard. However, I was willing to sacrifice the awesome Nokia E90 keyboard to compromise for E72's better features and not-so-bad keyboard. From best to worst, here is how I rank between different keyboards: HTC Touch Pro2 > Nokia E90 > Nokia E72 > HTC HD2 > Apple iPhone > Xperia X1. You will never accidentally turn on your phone and dial numbers when you leave the E72 in your pocket. The phone will never unlock in your pocket (as long as you manually or automatically lock the screen).Most importantly, the Nokia E72 has a better keyboard and better buttons than the E71. There really only is one thing about the E71 keys that are better than the E72 keys. Since the E72 has a mushy optical sensor, using the D-pad isn't fun. The Nokia E71 has a better D-pad (it's more clicky and less mushy). However, the E71 'functionality' buttons are very cramped. I find it two times more efficient pressing the Menu/Calendar/Contacts/Messaging button on the E72 because the buttons are larger and raised. Even the surrounding buttons work well. On the E71 I would press multiple buttons at once. This problem rarely happens on the E72. In terms of the QWERTY keys, the E72 and E71 are very similar. However, the number and Ctrl key on the E72 is larger by comparison. So the E72 wins in terms of keyboard and buttons.3) Battery Efficiency - The brand new battery on the E72 lasts much longer than the all of the phones I've had and used. Furthermore, it is easy to remove and replace, unlike the Nokia E90 and Xperia X1.4) Camera - The camera isn't that good. I still haven't found a phone with a camera that's worth using. From what I can see, I don't think their is much difference between Nokia E72 and Xperia X1's camera. However, the LED flash on the E72 is the pretty good compared to other phone. Of course, I haven't used the camera that much and I am not a camera pro so you can't rely on me in this area.5) Multimedia - the mono speaker on the back of the phone isn't very loud, but it isn't very quiet. It's much louder than the iPhone at max level but much softer than the Nokia E90 (which has amazing stereo speakers). The music player is great, and thanks to the keyboard, I can search through my music library without scrolling. Furthermore, the audio processing on this phone is on par to my laptop. I hear no difference in sound quality between my laptop and my E72 when I use the same headphones. Watching videos on the low-resolution phone is pretty decent and even clear, but because all Nokia comes with a terrible video player, I am disappointed. But thanks to how well a 600 qualcomm CPU performs on Symbian phones, multimedia is very breezy.6) Phone and Organizer - this is an Eseries Nokia device running on symbian. Most Eseries organizer and phone software are same or similar. Well, in my opinion, the Eseries software is better than Windows Mobile and iPhone. Of course one of the main problem with contacts, calendars, and notes on non-touchscreen Nokia's is that you need a good keyboard to be well organized. Well the E72 has a decent keyboard.But in regards other than software, the loudspeaker/speakerphone is very low so conversations will be annoying because it's hard to hear when you are in a noisy environment. Do not get this phone if your priority is to have a good speaker for phone calls in public environments (for music is is decent, especially when you like to hear it in a quiet place).7) Internet - the Wi-Fi browsing on this phone is much faster than the Wi-Fi on my Xperia X1, and E90. I can't comment on other phones. Scrolling through pages on the E90 was a nightmare. This problem is fixed on the E72. It also supports some flash content like you-tube, and for that, it is a very good phone for internet uses. For a non-touch screen phone, it's a good internet device. I actually prefer it over the HTC HD2.8) Price - for 330 U.S. dollars. This phone has the most return to each dollar you spent.If you guys are wondering:A) The accelerometer works with 3rd party software but has pre-installed settings to silent phone calls or alarms.B) The annoying animated-transitions between screens can be disabled in the phone settings.C) Do not buy this phone just because it has a customizable optical D-pad. It's not very good, and the reason I like it is to lock in the 'focus' when I take pictures.D) The Calendar, Contacts, and Messaging keys are completely customizable.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Notes from a new Nokia user (Win experienced)", "Author": "Andres Jimenez Zamora \"Andres Jimenez\"", "ReviewID": "R9MR365Q7IFO0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using Windows Mobile with an HTC unit for a while and I decided to give this phone a try (I was also tired of the many issues that Win Mobile has, and the many OS re-installations I had to go through with my old phone to get a nice & stable version).My first impressions with this phone: out of the box it looks very nice, very attractive and elegant look, similar to a Blackberry. It comes pre-charged but I immediately plugged it in to the wall just in case. It looked to me that it doesn't take much time for the battery to get full charge now that I've been using it for like a month, it is really fast when connected to a wall charger. It comes with a nice Nokia pouch. The USB cable is pretty small (about the length of a pen) which is not very useful. Also, don't believe what Amazon says about what's in the box. It says it comes with a Nokia navigation kit, which I didn't get. Bad for Amazon.On to the review of key features:** Connectivy: no issues on an international 850MHz 3G network (I live in Costa Rica). I've tested GSM as well with no issues. Push email working fine with work email accounts and personal ones. However, one day my personal inboxes just dissapeared without a reason so I had to reconfigure them. Very strange. Yahoo email will never work.** GPS: I haven't used it much but I do have Garmin Mobile XT installed with no issues. It takes a while to find satellites but I guess this is normal in smartphones.** Keys: Some users are right. It's kinda hard to text using just one hand to hold the phone at the same time. Keys might be too small for people with big fingers.** OS: not very stable. Whenever I want to switch personal and business profiles it hangs and I have to restart the phone. Sometimes it reboots itself out of nowhere.** Camera: very nice, pictures are really decent, as expected for a 5M camera. However, there's no way to turn off the shutter sound or the flash. Front camera comes with much less resolution. For those who want a very clear and sharp image for video calls, you will not get it with this phone. Video works really well but again it is very noticeable by others if you're recording a video (there's a sound to start/stop the camera which can't be turned off and a red light in the back of the phone).** Bluetooth: I use Bluetooth with my laptop at work all the time in parallel with my bluetooth headset, so it works real nice.** Power: I don't have to charge this phone every night like my old HTC!! It takes 3 full days for my battery to need a recharge and I use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and calls regularly through the day. This is a very nice feature in this unit.** Wi-Fi: hard to drop a connection so far. Very stable and fast.** Applications: they do the necessary job. There are some very useful apps in the Ovi store. PC applications to use with the phone are easy to use.In general I'm not completely satisfied with my purchase, but I do like the phone, that's why I rate it 4 stars. I mean probably sometime in the future I'll switch to a better unit, unless Nokia releases a new Symbian version with many of its bugs fixed, but this is one of the best mobile phones I've owned.", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best battery life of any smartphone", "Author": "Rob H.", "ReviewID": "R1AF64HF7JDSV3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an e-71 and (after substantial firmware upgrading) it was fantastic.

I fell in love with this phone the first time I saw it in the market overseas when I was travelling .. It was love at first sight .. They keep working models there as compared to dummy ones in the US, so I was actually able to touch, feel and use the phone for some time .. When I returned, my usual research began, which lasted about a month or so .. With each line I read about the E72, and each video I watched, my love for it kept on growing .. The only reason why I waited a month, was to get an answer to whether AT&T; would slap me with a $30/mo data plan even though this phone isn't branded by AT&T; (but is a smartphone nevertheless) .. However I simply could not suppress my urge to get the E72 for myself anymore and ordered 2 of these phones - one from Amazon (for myself), and one from another online merchant (as a gift for someone) ..The phone is really sexy and boasts of a really fast processor and the User Interface is too good .. Having used this phone for about a week, I started believing, I won't ever be able to live without it .. It connects to the web (wifi or 3g) seamlessly and syncing stuff from my computer and my email was very snappy .. The camera did an awesome job .. Overall I was satisfied with my investment .. inspite of some knick-knack below ..1. The battery cover felt kinda loose (as others have pointed out too). it seemed to move a bit, but wasn't too bad. I guess just a loose cover, but was okay with me since it wasn't falling off ..2. The optical track pad needed some getting used to .. I turned it off and then again on ..

The keypad LED placements and the button placements was kinda not thought over by the device makers .. 2 LEDs used to wink straight in my eye though the gaps between the buttons and that was annoying6.

Some of the body parts are now plastic rather than metal. This did not reduce the weight of the phone compared to the all metal designs, however.The biggest problem is stability. The phone resets AT LEAST once every day. Power cycling the phone in the morning does not help. This would be bad enough, but when it resets, sometimes it fails to register the SIM. This is a new ATT SIM and using another SIM card does not stop the problem. I use this phone for critical business and cannot have it silently reset and not at least properly come back online.

And while this device was advertized as the smart phone that was supposed to take over the Blackberry (The Economist and other magazines), in many aspects there is still much to be improved.So let me first say that I am a Nokia fan and for almost 2 years I productively and satisfyingly used the E71, a well built and reliable smart phone.Would I recommend buying the Nokia E72?  NO.I would rather suggest to either purchase its predecessor, the reliable E71, or to wait for the new Snapdragon-based (CPU) Nokia Symbian phones.The Hardware: The E72 CPU is definitely faster than that of the E71.  Battery life is good.  However, the construction and casing of the E71 was much better than the new E72.For instance, Nokia, among other things, redesigned the battery cover, by reducing the latches to a single latch located in the lower section of the upper side of the battery cover .On four different occasions, while on a call, I found the battery in my hand, with the expected sudden termination of the call and the long rebooting sequence to get back on line.The optical trackpad implementation could have been much better (too sensitive).  The display feels a bit small, and the loudspeaker isn't loud enough.The GPS:  I also experienced very long delays (between 5-10 minutes!) before the internal phone GPS would recognize any satellite and start functioning (this happened on a regular basis both in the EU and in US).The software.  The firmware that originally came with the phone, as of today I haven't heard of any new releases, is buggy, to say the least.The phone hangs often (with re-booting required) and the Bluetooth disconnects frequently from my car hands free device (also Nokia) while on a call.Nokia, disappointingly, also removed important business software from the E72 such as the Podcasting software, Internet radio and SIP client (all very useful business applications that were installed in the previous E71).  However, as someone else already pointed out, Nokia at least upgraded its Office applications (Quickoffice) to edit Office 2007 documents.Nokia has also added Multiscanner, Font Magnifier and Wpresenter, as standard applications.  I guess Nokia had to remove software somewhere in order to add the upgraded Quickoffice apps...If you happen to start the Psiloc World Traveler application on your E72 (as I did), you will receive continuous requests to connect your phone to the Internet via an annoying menu that pops up  regularly (Select connection). There is also no way to uninstall any of the pre-installed applications, and I have been told that there is no way to eliminate these Internet access pop-ups, unless you hard-reset the phone.Moreover, when you set up your IMAP email account in the E72, all outgoing mail will sit in your phone with no way to set up the client with the sent mail folder linked to your IMAP mail server (like most mail client apps).I conclusion, If Nokia releases new Firmware, I may increase my review to 4 stars, however, I believe that the Nokia E72 and E71 product managers should have met to discuss the redesign before producing a phone that is definitely inferior to its predecessor.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Pradkat", "ReviewID": "R259LVUEBZ6AX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace my E71.

I know, I've been living in the stone age it would seem, and desperately needed an upgrade. I'd been eying this model since the day the news of it's release broke out. I'd been keen and doing my standard research, comparing it to the legendary nokia E71, as dedicated E71 users would like to describe it, and I've been studying rates, making random comparisons with other brands and phone software, interfaces & operating systems.Somehow, I loved the phone the moment I saw it. It's advanced, savvy, looks very tech, has a glossy finish, it's just impeccably designed. It looks like a business phone in whole. The interface is cool (All apps are easily accessible and quick), my phone hasn't crashed or anything (which most people have been complaining about). I particularly love the NOKIA qwerty keypad, despite so much variety already existing in the market. I love the vibrant screen display, which is a window into this phone's complicated, yet easily accessible world.I've been carrying it to the office for the past couple of days and it is very impressive. There's a lot of compliments I've received about the looks of the phone and the display from all angles looks fabulous.The E71 vs. The E72? I think the E72 is a worthy successor to the latter and a winner. This phone has a different interface and despite the less chrome and E71's little more trendy looks relatively, is much better to use. There's not much to say here. I like the individuality of the phone, and have already made my comparisons. You can go ahead and still purchase the E71 for the looks, but in terms of software, firmware, & new applications, there's a lot of activity on the E72. I would also like to add that people need to stop complaining about the build quality of the model. This is a very pretty phone.The bottom line is, This sleek looking phone was the one for me. Might be the right choice for you too. Just get the feel of the phone before your purchase, at a local electronics store, and I guarantee that if you're looking for great business utilities, overall style & quality, you'll admire this lovely, classy, awesome looking business phone for what it is.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just an amazing phone.", "Author": "M.

It was a replacement for an N80 (which was a fantastic phone in its day) and my first E Series. The QWERTY layout drew me in and i have never looked at any other form factor since this one. It is a shame it is vanishing from the market in the transition to all touch all the time.i still have this phone, and recently decided to pick it back up as my main device (the Nokia E6-00 had been my main phone previously - i got it as a replacement for my aging E72 when the screen died). My learning curve on this phone was practically non-existent - it is the easiest phone to get along with i have ever had. The auto-focus 5MP camera is nice, too, as i have missed that on the E6. The EDOF sensors in the E6 and E7 lack close-up capabilities, so QR codes are not readable and a feature on the E72 that allows you to copy a business card to your contacts was gone, too.The optical track pad i find easier to use than the E6's touch interface (mainly due to the size of the screen) and realistically, the only thing i miss moving back to this phone is the high-res display (VGA on the the E6 vs QVGA on the E72). Although Symbian^3/Nokia Belle have some nice shortcuts to many connectivity features that S60 does not, i find the settings in S60 are FAR more easily navigated and intuitive.Another feature i had missed in Belle (present in the E72 in S60) is a customizable graphic equalizer. There is really no reason that this feature should be missing at all. Even the N8 (which is a multimedia device) does not have this feature.Quick Office (editing support for Word, PowerPoint and Excel) and Joikuspot (WiFI hotspot) are loaded from the factory.

Needs some time to get used to it, but in 2 days I already feel like I'll never be able to get close to a non-QWERTY keyboard.

So why the hell Nokia put only 250Mb of internal memory in this model?I had to give up more than half my playlists (mp3, aac, avi etc) to migrate for the brand new E72.The e-mail application, now.

The new Nokia Ovi-Maps app is great, a huge evolution compared to the previous version.- KEYBOARD AND TOUCHPAD: The keyboard is great. The new track pad navigation works for me.

If you are undecided between a Nokia E72 and a Blackberry then you are on the right path. But if you are looking for a touchscreen phone (think iPhone) then you'd better look elsewhere. Of course the E72 can play videos and music beautifully (it's 600mhz processor is quite fast) but this phone is definitively business oriented.So I will not compare this phone to an iPhone or anything similar because that would be like comparing apples to oranges. Comparing it to a Blackberry makes more sense. Well, it's definitively faster, lighter and thinner than a Blackberry. I also like the keyboard better. Actually, I absolutely love the QWERTY keyboard, it's easy on the fingers but it feels firm and well built at the same time.Navigation improved quite a bit thanks to the tiny optical touchpad and you still have E71's directional keys if you prefer them.As I mentioned before, the processor is quite fast and the user interface is snappy and responsive, exactly what a business user needs.  I'm also surprised by the excellent battery life (several days in a row with 3.5G on).Did I mention how thin it is? Just 0.39 inches! Even the iPhone is thicker at 0.48 inches and the Blackberry phones range between 0.53 and 0.60 inches... my E72 makes them look like burritos :) So if you care about form factor as much as I do, you're not going to be disappointed.Finally, I don't get why some people are complaining about the build quality. I'm slightly abusive with my phones... my previous phone was an LG and it broke in no time. This phone, on the other hand, feels compact and sturdy.

I could not believe how great the phone was. It came with PC Suite & so I would never have to re-enter phone numbers of calendar entries on a cell phone again. The E72 is my seventh Nokia phone. I went from the 6200 to the Nokia E51 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, International 3G, Wi-Fi, MP3/Video Player, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with Warranty (Rose Steel), an absolutely great phone--my first Smartphone. I still have it. I use it as a spare/backup. However, needing more horsepower, I graduated to Nokia N95 Unlocked Cell Phone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver/Red). This was, by far, the best and my favorite phone. It was also eyecandy to others. Like the E51, it was also my everyday/everywhere Mp3 player. It's hard to believe the number of audiobooks, music albums, data files, pictures and other things that I am able to carry around with me--always! I used up to 32GB MicroSD cards with both of them, although the E51 struggled a bit! When the N95 croaked, after three years, I looked at many different manufactures' models, but I still wanted to go Nokia. After much research, I tried the N97 Mini. It bombed. Actually, I was sucker to a Chinese clone rip-off (not on Amazon). I tried a safer choice approach, on Amazon, Nokia C6-01 Unlocked GSM Phone with 8 MP Camera, 720p Video Recording, and Ovi Maps Navigation--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver). You can read my review there. I was not very complimentary about it, vowing never to purchase another Nokia. I returned it for a refund.Again, I looked at many highly rated phones, like the Samsung Samsung I9000 Galaxy S Unlocked GSM Smart Phone with 5 MP Camera, Android OS, Touchscreen, Wi-Fi, GPS and MicroSD Slot - Unlocked Phone - No Warranty - Black (the only brand for which Windows Phone accepts a MicroSD card-although you have to \"marry\" it to the phone-see specs!) and several HTC models like the HTC A9192 Inspire 4G Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 3G Support, 8 MP Camera, Wi-Fi and GPS - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black. These caught my eye. Still, after more research, I found myself wanting a Nokia. For someone who favored them for almost 14 years now, it just seemed like a no-brainer. Reviews all tell the story of Nokia loyalty. I have not been on a cell phone contract for over eight years, so I just buy the phones I want (all Nokia) & change the SIM card. I have liked them for their simplicity, their many features and their ease of use. Anyway, hands down the E71 probably will go down as Nokia's best or favorite phone. In spite of that, I was attracted to the E72 which had high reviews and had improvements over the E71, in spite of what was said by the extreme E71 loyalists. And for the price that \"BLINQ\" was offering for \"Open Box\" models on Amazon, I thought I would take one more chance.When I first opened the box for this Nokia E72, I was pleased. Although bigger, it had the same feel as the E51. After charging and some initial setup procedures, I did what I have always done. I updated the software/firmware. Then I \"synched\" it with my Microsoft Outlook. It's a real easy procedure. I have always used Nokia PC Suite--I have not been very fond of the Ovi Suite software. I have done this for over ten years now. It's pretty basic stuff.As happened on the C6-01, from the time the sync was complete, I began to get messages: \"Memory Full. Close some applications and try again.\" These were mostly when trying to use the Calendar, but it also happened for Contacts and for other things and at other times. I did a restore to factory settings, and repeated this process, before I went online looking for a solution. None of it worked.I thought, \"Oh no! I'll be sending this back too!\" I am usually able to get to the bottom of technical problems, but this was frustrating. I had visited so many forums for the C6-01 & got nowhere. So, I decided to once again to \"Google\" the above message and re-examine the forums, looking for a \"clue\" to a solution which might point me in another direction. This worked. I found a \"clue!\" One person wrote how \"Memory Full\" message was not related to memory at all, but was due to a corrupted Outlook file. It offered a three-step solution. 1) Reformat the phone using the *#7370# command. 2) Run the \"Scanpst.exe\" program on the Outlook file (supplied by Microsoft but must be searched for) and let it find and correct any problems (which it did). 3) Synch with Ovi rather than PC Suite (which seemed to go against my grain, but I did it). I am glad I did. This phone now works like a charm!I love it! I am sure already that this is the best phone that I've owned. I do however fault Nokia for the poor troubleshooting help that they are providing their customers now. Regardless, I still give this five-stars: I prefer Nokia over the others. This is true of so many other people too, including Blackberry users, who try a phone like this. They cannot believe the power & functionality at their fingertips without the exorbitant cost. It is an incredible business phone.When I look back at this solution, I realize that I probably did not need to return the Nokia C6-01 phone. I am sure that the above solution would work just fine for it (I should update my review of it accordingly). Still, I am not sorry I returned it, because it gave me the opportunity to purchase the E72 and I am very happy I did.With the above caveat surrounding a corrupted Outlook file, and the workable solution, I have no problem highly recommending this phone.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Big disappointment from loyal Nokia customer", "Author": "camisdad \"camisdad\"", "ReviewID": "R2XDFQZ1UBAB1M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have used Nokia cell phones exclusively for the past 15 years. 18 months ago, looking for my next cell phone, I selected the E72 based on the abundance of positive reviews. My experience with it has been so poor that I am no longer a Nokia man.The core issue, to me, is global software flakiness. I never know when/ how the sw is going to malfunction. I cannot count on something as fundamental as a ring or a profile. With my phone set on a given profile and ring, I am never sure that it will actually ring - it might decide to only vibrate or beep once rather than ring. It will randomly change profiles without being prompted to do so - and I never know when that might happen... To reiterate, this phone is so unreliable that you cannot count on getting a ring when waiting for a phone call!Beyond the global flakiness, there are myriads of small, but unpleasant, usability problems. You still get the \"Select Connection\" screen every time you unlock the keyboard - even if you disable broad band, compelling you to press exit twice. Without shortcuts it takes 4 clicks to get into Contacts. The default call list shows only dialed numbers rather than both in and out calls... I could go on multiple pages. Some of these issues you can correct through customization - others are impossible to avoid.I spent multiple hours over the past 18 months on the user's manual, forums, and support calls. I have now given up on ever getting this phone to work properly. I was looking for a solid international business phone with access to email and GPS, and that did not need too many bells and whistles. What I got was totally unusable for my basic purposes.

To call some one you can set the usual speed dials but for the rest you just start typing their name. No need to go to contacts first, just start to type the name - awesome! The free GPS is better than the GPS that came in my car. So far with email and Skype on the battery life has been good. The Camera Quality  is also excellent.

The software is another story.... Symbian seems like a full feature O/S it can pretty much do everything under the hood Android and iOS can do. So what's wrong with this phone you ask???The user interface... is absolute garbage, the phone feels like it's designed by engineers meaning it can do everything if you have time to dig through menu after menu after menu of configurations. 90% of the time the stuff you want to do day to day is pretty basic so you want to be able to do it QUICKLY which is NOT how the user interface designers designed this phone. The E series phone is supposed to be a BUSINESS oriented phone meaning messaging is a key feature. However this phone doesn't support sub folders in imap meaning you can only see your inbox you can't sync your drafts, sent items etc... you also can't sync any sub folders you have in your mail box this is absolutely critical.Aso this phone can get unstable after a little while of use, you'll randomly start running out of memory to the point where the phone cannot boot up because there's not enough free memory. The only thing you can do to fix this is \"hard reset\" erasing all your data and factory resetting your phone.

I ended up paying $100 more, BUT, it was worth it. The first thing I did was throw out the manual and just play with all the configurations. The battery lasted over two days, which is great, because it was steadily used. I use my cell phone as my only phone and now that I have figured all the kinks, I LOVE IT!! I found out that you have to keep the phone in power save mode, and the battery can last up to five days (tried, tested and true). There is also the feature that if your in a meeting, you just have to flip the phone upside down, and it silences all calls and alarms. It does this with the aid of a light sensor. The other great feature is that I can have a personal mode, with fun and weird(a.k.a unprofessional )things on my desktop, AND also have a business mode, so when I go to work, all my colleagues and my boss think I have a professional work ethic because my business mode is very neat, organized and professional.

I love it, even though I now have to charge the batteries outside the phone (on board charging regulator chip died and it is not worth replacing). It has been great for my purposes. I travel internationally a lot and it works everywhere, even Japan and Korea ( which do not support regular GSM bands, but only the 2100 MHz UMTS band, which the E71-1 has but the US E71-2 lacks). Excellent battery life.  I have not missed the US 3G much. The one downer on the E71 is the camera, which even after many firmware upgrade releases still tints photos green-blue, esp. in low light. `But it  does have  autofocus with close up mode, and works decently with good light.I recently got an E72-2 (US version), and am delighted with its improved features. It charges both on the Nokia small pin charger and via micro USB, and its battery life is even better than that of the E72. It supports all four GSM bands, the original 1900 MHz N American 3G band, the newer 850 MHz 3G band used in N America, Australia, and S. America, and the 2100 MHz 3G band used outside the US. The only coverage it lacks is the 1700/2100 duplex 3G band used by T-Mobile. (I am on AT&T;). Thus, the E72 is a universal phone that will work anywhere. The camera resolution has been increased to 5 MP, it still has autofocus, close up mode,  the tint problem has been resolved, and now it even does time lapse. The keyboard layout has been improved, though the smaller space bar and the touch feature on the D-pad take some getting used to (you can turn the touch pad feature off).The E72 has a tweaked version of the Symbian S60v3 operating system, which I am used to having started with Psions years ago. This works fine for me, but is considered obsolete by the techie blogs, and Nokia is (sadly) going to abandon Sybmian for Windows Phone in future products.  A full version of Quickoffice is embedded and works well, and additional useful software can be had for modest prices from Handango and other sites. A more powerful PDF reader than that already built in is also available for about $10 or less from Quikoffice.I speak several languages, and use excellent dictionaries from MobiSystems and Slovoed. There also lots of free and paid utilities in the Ovi store, on the Handango, Paragon, Mobisystems, and Psiloc web sites that are worth a look.For email, I mostly use the mobile Gmail app from Google. The E72 also has a built in email client, For web browsing, I use the excellent Symbian optimized version of Opera Mini 6. Note that using the unlocked E71 and E72 on AT&T; does not require you to purchase a more expensive Smartphone data package---I use the regular phone unlimited data package that (when combined with Family Messaging) costs $10/month. (note that you cannot get this lovely unlimited deal as a new user anymore, there are 100MB etc packages, but still cheaper than a Smartphone data plan).The E72 has VPN capability, but the configuration documentation is cryptic, and I have not used it. It can be done, there are several web guides.If you are very nearsighted like me, you can take your glasses off and watch movies in the  plane  on the E72 in MP4 (built in Realplayer) or AVI (using the paid Smartmovie or Coreplayer software). I am not sure that normal sighted people would find this workable without strong reading glasses.There are tradeoffs here to be sure. The 2.4\"screen is smaller than that on newer touch screen phones (iPhone, Nokia N97 mini, Android etc). But this allows room for a QWERTY keyboard without requiring a slider which makes a phone thicker and less robust.All in all, I find the E72 nearly ideal for my purposes. Thin and compact, QWERTY keyboard, good camera (though not the equal of that in the N82 and other camera-centric phones), abundant software.  I am using it as my main phone, and also take the E71 on travel as a spare and to use with overseas SIM cards (the E71 and E72 use the same battery, another convenience).After experimenting with several cases, I have now settled on an Invisible Shield for the screen, and a perforated plastic back cover from an ebay vendor ($4). I carry the phone in a pants pocket, or on a lanyard in my shirt breast pocket (untethered phones in shirt pockets often end their lives underwater).Prices for good used E72s on ebay are dropping to ~$150 (and sometimes even less)  as people jump to iPhones and Android phones. Add a Squaretrade warranty for $25 or so and you have an unlocked, all band, WiFi capable, budget priced Smartphone.Highly recommended.", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice hardware, horrible OS", "Author": "Salmon", "ReviewID": "R1OQOYTW6ZG28V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nicely built phone, but my God, does Nokia even test their software?

This phone seems nicer- the flashlight is still there, it's easier to turn bluetooth on and off, ovi maps is included, it's shiney, hefty, faster, has a front facing camera but....Hardware:There is an extra row of buttons from previous bar phones and that both impinges upon the QWERTY and makes it more difficult to use the extra row of buttons. The buttons add no new functionality- they've just made it more confusing and difficult to use function you want. In particular, separating the accept/reject and call/hangup/power buttons from two into five buttons is well, silly and frustrating. If you haven't used a Nokia before you may just find it annoying, if you've used a Nokia before you'll find yourself hitting the wrong thing and having to poke around with your thumb only to end up hitting the wrong thing over and over. Volume buttons on the side of the phone are nice though. Optical pad is a wash- really what's the point the mechanical one worked great, this one not so much esp if you have liquid on your fingertips. It doesn't work as well as the old mechanical button (often doesn't catch your finger) and it's optional vibrations is just annoying bling. The earphone plug now jaunts out a cocky new angle- great except you know what happens to cocky individuals- they get broken off. I'd don't get it.Software:Here's the REAL downside- Nokia have taken the reliable but not flashy Symbian in the E63i/E63 etc and turned it into a confusing, non-functional morass. The only upside I found was the \"hold the home and active applications pop up\" feature. Otherwise- bluetooth seems nonfunctional with all handsfree radio features I've tried with with- didn't work with my TomTom, my car radio or my wifes. Sometimes it connects, sometimes not, when it does connect sound is crackly and callers claim my voice is garbled. My daughter's E63 and my wife's G1 function perfectly with all these units so it's the E72 not the units. The messaging seems to longer support Conversations (the threaded SMS software) so it's back to 2003 and non-sortable, no threading SMS which is a real pain for active texters- you'll spend a lot of time deleting messages, scrolling up and down to find things and so on. Both fring and Skype periodically just stop working- you have to remove and reinstall to get call out functionality back. On the E63 both just worked flawlessly. The ordering of the installed applications and menus for configuration have been reorganized and not for the better- it's very difficult to configure a SIP account and by the way- out of the box the phone doesn't support SIP. Very lame.... You literally will spend hours and hours on forums begging the very patient and understanding Nokia employees who volunteer their time there to help you get even the most basic stuff working. Specifically....Nothing is where you think it isNokia has rearranged the menu structure to bring all things you don't use and don't care about up to the top and bury all the useful functionality deeply into a non-obvious and seemingly random location. Once you get there, what you're trying to do (see SIP and synching for instance) won't work unless you get something else from somewhere or set it up in a non-intuitive way not covered in the manual but only in the tenth description someone else on the net has spent hours of their life trying to figure out.Syncing with Google Calendar doesn't workFor instance, if you've used the very functional and easy MFe before to sync with Google calendar and contacts before- forget it. The E72 turns this single step process into 23 steps to sort of sometimes get it working with no feedback. MFE is now somehow integrated into the phone only in such a way that it doesn't work and won't provide any feedback. You literally have to set it up using fake info, cause it to fail and then reset it up to make it work. How Nokia think a phone that requires this sort of nonsense to work is viable is beyond me.SIP doesn't workAgain, you have to search pages of forums to find out the top of the line phone doesn't support SIP as delivered. It pretends it does, there's a SIP setting but it does absolutely nothing. You can't connect to SIP from from the WAN scan like you used to either. What? Instead you have to register in yet another forum (which you can't do from the phone) to download an unofficial piece of software to enable an \"advanced setting\" only to discover that's yet another can of worms to get going. I still don't have SIP working...Multitasking is just confusingInstead of having a straighforward- what you see is what you are doing, Nokia has turned Symbian into some sort of web page where things are filling up your memory but you don't know they are running and getting to them takes page after page of \"back\" or \"exit\" or something. You will wear your fingers out with this crap. Inconveniently, the menu options never use will be the top default and what you do all the time (exit) requires three or four finger presses.Despite the fast processor, actual use is MUCH slowerEvery press is accompanied by a flashing \"fade\" which just wastes your time without providing useful feedback- it just makes everything slower. By slower, I mean a LOT slower. Your WAN settings aren't remembered, you have to reconnect EVERY time,OVI is just more of the sameI don't get OVI- it's a dumb name, if it's meant to include all the Symbian software it doesn't seem to come close.Not one piece of the software needed to get the basic stuff (internet radio, SIP, sync) was there and seemingly everytime I foolishly try to see if something is there it needs to update itself before it works. They should either ditch this stupid \"service\" ASAP and put things back on web pages which DON'T require a different registration (Nokia forums, my nokia, nokia beta labs, Ovi) or put everything in Ovi. Seriously. For instance, try and download Nokia maps from Ovi for the E72- it doesn't work. Isn't this one of the only reasons someone would buy this phone?Threaded conversations are no moreIt used to be that Nokia Converations allowed you to thread your conversations by topic, sender, etc. Conversations still can be downloaded but it no longer works- your one and only option now is just a straight list. Great maybe for a teenager who just texts for fun but try and find a conversation when you're chatting with someone- it's no fun to have to look through 100 SMS to find the one you want when with conversations you could have found it in three thumb clicks. I've ended up abandoning SMS on the phone and just use google voice SMS because it's an order of magnitude better.Nokia has REALLY screwed the pooch on this one. The E72 is a terrible downgrade in functionality from any Nokia phone I've owned before. I was always excited and pleased by the new functionality of Nokia phones- no more. Nokia's were always functional, reliable, straightforward, MADE IN EUROPE NOT CHINA, and had all the features other phone/operating systems crowed about. No more.....

A disgrace, so let me fill you in on why.First a few things, just so you know where Im coming from :1) Ive been a Nokia user for over a decade. Owned probably close to ten different phones. Always eagerly awaited the next one. I know the symbian s60 system pretty well, so my points below aren't coming from someone who doesn't yet understand the phone.2) My last phone was the E71, which Ive had since it was released. If you are an E71 user, and love that phone like I do, and were just hoping for a few tweaks to make it even better, well, you are going to be immensely disappointed with the E72.3) If you know nothing of the E71, (or even the E51, or E63) you should still read this, because even if that phone did not exist, the E72 in and of itself is a disaster.With that, I say : welcome to disappointment centrale! Wow.This phone ,the E72, unlocked US version, is like a distant [...] cousin or something to the E71. It sort of looks like the E71, but crappier. Right out of the box, feels crappier. Cheaper. You almost know it's made in china before you look at the box and confirm the \"telefono hecho en China\" (like they thought they could disguise it by writing it in Spanish. Morons.Let's talk build quality :So I thought, maybe it feels light and cheaply made because of the plastic, or because the battery isnt in yet. Maybe, right. Well, go to put the battery in - ick, here starts the bad experience with the phone. A flimsy little plastic tab that doesnt really release the battery cover properly. Plus they changed the neat design on the back of the E71 to something boring. And of course, as many have noticed, the back cover does not seat tightly. Yes, it's easier to open than the E71, but with the E71, you NEVER thought that one day the back cover would fail. And it didnt jiggle around. (Yes, this review is going downhill fast.) And the battery life isn't nearly as long as the E71.Next up, when you look at the back of the phone, you notice this THING jutting out. Ohhh, the camera, which is still only marginally better than the E71 (wont replace your canon, sorry), but now annoyingly bulbous and in the way. Why?On the side of the phone, the E71 had nice rubbery covers for the usb and memory card - this one, hard plastic, with the motorola style attachment that you can already see coming off months before it finally does. For those like me who want to use this as a modem via usb, but also put it in your pocket...ahh, yes, wait til that breaks off, then gets gunked up with pocket lint. Joy! But even better, try to open these things. You either have to have long fingernails, or use some sort of device to pry it open. Great. This pretty much assures you that you'll drop the phone one day trying to open up the usb tab.Speaker - incredibly tinny versus the E71. I'm embarrassed by the audio on this thing now. Sad. And they removed many of the really good audio clips, tones, etc, that were on the E71, and replaced them with garbage.Plug for earphones (headset) - go ahead and try it, then look at what you've done. Yup the plug seats at an angle, which just looks bad. Yes the top of the phone is sloped, but that doesn't mean the jack should go off at an angle.Four way key - very unpleasant to use (more below on this) -  when you click it to the right, it sticks a bit, so if you next go to click to the left, it first clicks to get unstuck, then you can move left. Ridiculous. The center button, complete mush. No click sensation, just a mushy \"I think I pushed it in\" effect. Horrid. I can only hope that mine is defective, because this is completely unacceptable. But the sharp edge on the thing is by design. And it's awful to use. Did someone think that if they made the edge sharp, they'd force people to use the center optical scroll button?Main menu keys. This is probably more the fault of a stupid engineer, rather than an MBA. But who knows....on the E71, the four main keys are just that, four individual main keys. On the E71, they aren't. Perhaps it was for visual effect, but the key surfaces are all integrated, melding into a short stumpy capital \"I\" shape. And when you push one of them, like you often do with Nokia's operating system, you get a soft mushy response. No click. The bottom two have slightly more of a click feel, but the top two are mostly mush. FAIL.Now, granted the build quality is horrible compared to the E71, but the software, adios mios...the software.Business phone, right? Yup. E series. Enterprise. Well, this phone will put you out of business if you rely on it. In fact, you just cant rely on it.Email - with E71, you had two options, with your gmail and yahoo type accounts easily set up and very functional through Nokia Messaging. And your pop mail for work, like I have, could go through the other email system on the phone. Both worked fine, although the mail settings for the pop mail were not actually push, but rather every 5 minutes that it would check, so, no instantaneous email. With the e72, all the mail is routed through nokia messaging. That would actually be great, except one big thing. IT DOESNT WORK most of the time. Even when it does work, there is no option to view mail in HTML. Every single forking email you have to click once to open, then click again to view as HTML. And when you do so, what happens? Every email typically takes 10 to 30 seconds to load, if it loads at all. Disaster, unusable in its current form. Sometimes, when you open the program, and try to delete out your emails...they disappear with the (x) delete key on the side. Sometimes, they dont. Other times, a message that youve already viewed, try to open it again, nothing. NOT READY FOR PRIMETIME.Optical keypad - had to turn it off after a few days. Here is the problem...no matter how fast or slow or hard or soft you move your thumb across the area, it moves one item. This is NOT the functionality that makes a scrollball/trackball useful. Therefore, it serves almost no purpose. The only reason it is at all useful is that they redesigned the 4way pad around the optical key, with nice sharp edges, and made it really stiff too, so if you have to use it a lot, like I do, eventually it digs into your thumb and is quite annoying. FAIL.Web browsing - faster in terms of processing a page, and faster for scrolling around. But for some reason, many many times you click on the browser and it just sits, lifeless. You close it, start again, even when it says a decent signal with 3G. Nothing. Most of the time its unusable. Other times, you click on your bookmark...it starts going, then sure enough - invalid server name. Other times, you go to bookmark manager, and sometimes the bookmarks work, and other times, you click on them, and nothing. Plus, the menu items for additional browser menus are screwed up. You use the close button to close one of the window tabs, as you would on the E71, sometimes it closes that window, other times, it closes the whole web browser program and you have to start over. Added skyfire as a workaround, same problem with connectivity. Does not seem to want to pick up the ATT internet signal. FAIL.Now yes, many of these software issues will likely be resolved with a new firmware update. But when? If a person buys this phone, is already up and running with the E71, and thinks they are going to have a working phone, they are out of luck, so they are stuck with two phones. One, they just bought, but they cant use it because it's totally screwed up. And this is for the lucky people who have a phone with a build quality that, while cheap, isn't defective. I, on the other hand, am going to have to send mine back, because the fourway key is clearly screwy. But do you REALLY think I want to roll the dice with this phone again, given the potential for just receiving another phone with a different set of issues? No, I dont.This company can't be admonished enough for what they have done with this phone. Please please please, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. If you want to go down this road with Nokia, get the E71. The E72 should be discontinued, and we should all get refunds for this turd.3/3/10 update : finally a firmware update, 3 months after Ive owned the phone. Result - mail still broken, web browser still flawed, phone still an expensive piece of crap. And now it's [...] less than what I paid for it, and freebies thrown in. Can you say RIPOFF? Next update will be when I contact Nokia for a refund/exchange. And one more thing was pointed out on this phone in recent days, to my embarrassment : the earpiece, at the top of the phone, is crooked.

I've owned the E71 and E75 phones prior to this one and the E72 trumps them both.  I hate touchscreens, but qwerty phones are becoming more and more rare.  I needed a phone with a good camera, good mp3 player, reliable internet access (not necessarily fast), and strong texting capabilities.  I have owned this phone for 7 months and it is by far the best cell I've owned.With a good set of headphones, the MP3 player is amazing, volume is loud yet clear.  Speaker quality with music player is decent, but not as loud as I would like.  The build quality is sturdy and the design is quite handsome.  The size dimensions are comparable with the E71.  The Qwerty kepboard is superior to that of the E71, E5, and E75.  Since the keys are perfectly spaced apart, you can type fast without worrying too much about double or incorrect key presses.  The included video player is nothing nice.  You definitely want to upgrade to an app that plays flv, avi, etc (Rushplayer is a great media player for the E72).  Large movie files play very smooth if encoded correctly.  Unlike the E71, this phone features a 3mm headphone jack.  No need for adapters.  The increase in memory over the E71 is not as significant as I would have liked, but the phone can handle 32gb SD cards easily.The camera quality is awesome for a phone of it's time (5mp with autofocus and flash).  More than sufficient to capture good times.  Pictures come out clear.  Close range photos in total darkness are clear.  Flash works great.  I think if the phone had dual flash, night photos would be a little better.  Call quality rocks but seems a little temperamental when you alter the volume.  Never results in bad quality but it fluctuates from good to perfect, and perfect to good as you turn the volume up and down.I would have liked for the phone to feature dual Sim but you can't have it all. It's now 2012 but this phone is definitely ageless in design and arguably ageless in features. It has pretty much all that I need + more. I will no doubt buy another E72 when this one passes on.

The only good thing about the E72 is the 5MP camera that takes decent pictures.  But unfortunately the \"flash\" focus light (can't be disabled) tends to ruin close up pictures. I miss the manual focus on the E71.The new 3.5mm audio port is a double edge sword. Finally, you can use regular earphones to listen to music on your E72. But unfortunately Nokia likes to ruin the fun by using proprietary wiring for the 3.5mm port. So 99.9% of the 3.5mm earphone w/ mic on the market (apple, skull candy, maximo, jbuds, v-moda) won't work with the E72. Because of the proprietary wiring, the sound output from these regular 3.5mm earphones with mic sounds like rubbish.Another nuisance I encountered is the badly designed recessed buttons(OK, CANCEL & DIAL, HANGUP). I tend to use these buttons a lot more than the short cut buttons (HOME, CALENDAR, ADDRESS BOOK, MESSAGE) and can't help constantly pressing the wrong buttons when I want to send messages, ok or cancel out of something. The short space bar is also pretty annoying. But, I do like the regular symbols being available on the keyboard rather than having to select them from a menu on the E71. Overall, I would prefer the E71 buttons layout.I'm also disappointed with FP2. I keep running into out of memory errors even though I have no applications running. This is probably due to bad programming and memory leaks. But I do have to give credit to Nokia for making the contacts, calendar and message transfer between my E71 and E72 seamless.All I can say is, come on Nokia you have been in the business longer than anyone else, stop messing around and get your act together.

The font is too small, there is nothing but html text and each website takes over a minute to load. The speed is not dependent on your service or connection, the phone just has a terrible internet browser.- Ovi GPS is a joke. It never works, and when it does it looses the signal every twenty seconds. The whole free GPS for life time is all nonsense because it never works- Camera, this is one of the only nice things about the phone, but it is very annoying to take pictures with this phone because the LED flash is often too bright. It also doesn't come with an installed video recorder.- The interface and OS is one of the worst I have ever seen on a smart phone. It is not aesthetically pleasing at all and doesn't function nearly as well as an iphone or blackberry. Most of the other smartphone I have used have had better interfaces.- Mail for exchange biggest joke ever. It doesn't sync with gmail.- DO NOT GET THIS PHONE IF YOU HAVE A MAC.

Would not recommend.Stability -- Terrible.  Applications crash or lock up frequently.  My max uptime is less than one day.  It is trivial to crash this phone.  This is with the latest available firmware (as of 20099-12-13) and stock applications.  Sometimes the crash is limit to just one app, other times it's the whole phone.  Sometimes it locks up hard and the only way to recover is to remove the battery.  I've had to pull the battery three times in five days.Sound quality -- The sound quality during calls is excellent.  Plenty loud enough.Battery -- Battery life is excellent.  I can go two days on a full charge compared with one day on my iphone.  I'm impressed by the battery life.Web browser -- The built-in browser does not support tabs or multiple pages of any kind so you may spend a lot of time using the back button.  The only real alternative to the built-in browse is Opera Mobile 10, which is in beta and has some significant bugs on the E72 (e.g. the \"u\" key types an asterisk, \"*\").Mail -- I use the phone with both an IMAP sever and an Exchange server.  Both work well.  I've encountered two flaws.  One is with IMAP support.  You have no control over where copies of sent message are stored.  Unlike most IMAP clients you cannot choose the folder.  The other flaw is mass delete.  If you have many messages you wish to delete there are three options.  Mark all messages in the folder and delete (deletes *all* messages in the folder), delete and confirm each message individually (two clicks per message), or mark each message you wish to delete and delete (requires *five* clicks per message).Tethering -- I'm impressed how easy it was to tether via USB.  Works great with NetworkManager on Linux.  No extra drivers needed.  When phone asks, choose \"PC Suite\" mode.Overall -- It's a good phone when it works.  However, it is so unreliable that I cannot recommend it to anyone.  Is there hope in a newer firmware (when one is released)?  Maybe.  Unfortunately, the more I read and ask around, the more I heard that Nokia phones are not known for stability.  I'm doubtful.

I bought it unlocked at full price because I travel frequently to Africa and Latin America for work and want to be able to use local SIM cards and local service to avoid AT&T;'s OUTRAGEOUS international roaming rates. Since I am frequently on the road (literally - in a car), I use my smartphone to take notes that I can later transfer to my laptop.First what I DO like about it: it's light, fits well in the hand and the pocket - not too bulky, easy to carry. Looks nice, too. Short list, though.Now what I don't like: The operating system in general is awkwardly designed. Some very basic functions (like \"Save\" in QuickOffice - the stand-in for MS Office) are located at the bottom of a long string of options on a drop-down menu. You can't save frequently while typing without scrolling through a long list of much less frequently used functions - very annoying and inefficient. GPS works sometimes, but doesn't integrate well with the contacts list (e.g., search on GPS requires typing in the full address rather than choosing from a pick-list). This is true even in the US where directions are easy.Web browser is awkward - most web pages don't adapt to the phone's screen, so content is difficult or impossible to read and navigate. Pages loads slowly or not at all. Impossible to download attachments to emails - even if they're small (< 1M). Documentation, both printed and on-line, is limited and difficult to search. Took me forever to find simple things like how to turn off predictive text when using messaging. Tech support is also poor - the device kept popping up with messages saying it was searching for a WLAN connection, even after I turned it off - several layers of tech support personnel insisted there was nothing wrong or that nothing could be done to avoid the problem, but it was very difficult to get escalated to someone who knew what they were doing. The phone often crashes after software updates, then recovers hours later for no discernible reason. Meanwhile, soft resets, power-off, battery removal, etc., have no effect.On my last trip to Ghana, the phone worked fine with a local SIM card (Vodafone) for several days, then stopped working entirely - the same chip worked perfectly in phones belonging to my colleagues - SIM cards from other carriers (MTN, Zain) were the same: worked in their phones, not in mine. Finally had to buy a cheap local phone to get me through the rest of the trip.Synchronizes, sort of, with MS Outlook - I'm not a big Outlook fan, but it's what my office uses - can't get away from it - and even through Nokia PC Suite, the application that's supposed to make the two systems communicate with one another, the fields in contact records often don't match and information gets lost, particularly if its in the notes field.In developing countries, it's still possible to get a phone that's just a phone - no camera, no word processer, no GPS or internet browser - and Nokia seems to do pretty well with these devices. But this so-called \"Smart\" phone isn't very smart and when I can replace the E72 - which I hope will be soon! - I will stay away from Nokia.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "A smart/business phone that cannot send emails", "Author": "Khush", "ReviewID": "R2C6UZIGOIN0PW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT THIS PHONE!I have been using the NOKIA e71x for nearly 2 years now & wanted to get something new.

I purchased two of these phones both of which have dust & blemishes on the underside of the screen/faceplate which appear as dead pixels or black specks on the screen.  One of the units is so bad that I am returning it for a new exchange since I really like the phone.  Amazon.com has been very cooperative and is expediting the exchange.  Hopefully, the new phone will not have the dust and/or blemishes like the first phone.  I upgraded to the E72 from the E71 which I also purchased from Amazon.com.  The E71 was blemish free.Update:I received my replacement unit yesterday.  I am pleased to report that this unit although not perfect, is much better than the original unit.Update:The replacement unit performed flawlessly for the first four weeks after I received it.  It is now shutting off on its own and the screen displays a bright red spot when you unlock the keypad and the display starts to return from power saving mode.  I've had this phone seven (7) days beyond the eligible return window so I can't return it for a replacement.  I would not recommend purchasing this phone.  As a result I have changed my rating to one (1) star.  I should have kept my E71.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "jtm cr", "ReviewID": "R22PZY0XMLVKW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "after having motorola, palm, sony ericsson and other nokia i just have to say this phone is amazing , all its features are the result of years of R&D; from nokia.Highly recommened, you wont stop texting and using it all day long.Buy!", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "claim", "Author": "ernesto montoya", "ReviewID": "R2HB89QJ4K41WJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hi, I raise a claim in favor of the Nokia E72, I bought the 6 February and still no answer arriving in Venezuela I would like to inform me of the status of this product thank you very much", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "nice bright dizayn  but battery life low", "Author": "Ahmet Yusuf Hanlioglu \"yule\"", "ReviewID": "R11B097N7V44C1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "first i bouth to phone nokia e71 thats awesome phone but i gave as a gift to my close friend after iboutgh ths phone  but no worth like e 71 battary life so low smart navigation key not a usefullif u wanna buy this phone dont do it rather buy e 761 and save money and get to good phone only the difference each other cam thats it be for this reviev i returned to phone", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "A terrible waste of the E71 legacy", "Author": "Eggs", "ReviewID": "R419AEGK2IZ53", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got the E72 after using the E51 and then the E71 for almost 2 years.  I had read the negative reviews about the E72 but considered myself to be comfortable enough with the OS to be able to make the device work for me.For me, what set the E71 apart from the rest of the pack (the iPhone, Blackberry, etc) was the flexibility in managing the messaging.  Setting up email and ActiveSync was a breeze on the E71 and it worked flawlessly every time.  The keyboard was as good as I wanted it to be and with the right apps downloaded on the phone, my experience was fantastic.  It has been, by far and away, the best phone I have ever used.  Nokia totally and utterly messed up the messaging aspect with their Nokia Messaging utility in the phone.  After trying to set up things for several hours, I gave up.  For the life of me, I cannot figure out why you would have a folder called \"Email\" and a different folder called \"Messaging\".  When I go to the Inbox in Messaging, it tells me that I have no mailbox configured after I just spent an hour dancing around the bugs in Nokia Messaging to set up my work email and Gmail.  The email shortcut key defaults to the \"Messaging\" Inbox - I know I can set it up to do whatever I want, but why?I give it 2 stars simply because of the front facing camera functionality - it works like a charm with fring.  But I was truly disappointed with this phone and I had such high expectations.

I'm sure a lot of people will find this handset to be worth every cent. Compared with other full-qwerty phones, this E72 rates very highly.However, the Nokia E71 was a major selling phone globally, but got very little media coverage.Nokia, the dominant player in the global mobile market, gained mind share in the late 90s the old fashion way...delivering good phones to customers. There was relatively very little talk about Nokia in the press, but a lot of viral word of mouth.I'm very skeptical of the large media coverage of Apple iPhone, RIM Blackberry and Google Android. I can partly understand RIM's success in that they consistently targeted business users with push email. I've seen people use the iPhone in such a way to make sure that people around notice they're using something that's the current media talking point. I know of a few guys who buy iPhones only to give it to their wife, who use the iPhone for a while and then change to a more robust Nokia phone.I find that Nokia have a wide range of handset designs that are suited to a larger spectrum of users (teens, moms, young adults, professionals, seniors).However, some of the good phones seem to lack just \"one thing\" to attract full blown media blitz...not enough RAM, or lower res camera or keypad size or screen size.Nokia need to come up with a \"cool and complete\" phone every once in a while and commit more towards promoting that \"cool and complete\" model in the media.Nokia seem to be content to let the sales volumes speak up for some of their popular models (eg N95, E71), but supporting the sales volume with some marketing campaign may help to capture back some of the mindshare and the media space.Nokia's marketing certainly need to get their act together and put across a conherent message for each phone or range of phones.", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Compare this to iPhone 3gs", "Author": "Tech Gadget geek \"gadget testing geek\"", "ReviewID": "RBYDMKHMBS57O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "iPhone 3gs is far better than this phone. Although Apple has only been in the smart phone market for about 3 years but I think they are doing a far better job designing the user interface and etc for the iPhone. I wanted to try this phone out and see if Nokia is still as user friendly as it was. Sadly it is not at all, compared to the iPhone. I think there's too much junks and there's probably a huge learning curve for using the phone. As for the iPhone, I feel like most people even infants would know how to play and navigate around it, the interface is fairly simple. If you have a chance to get the iPhone 3gs at a discounted price, it is a much better phone than this. Even android OS beats the OS they have on the E72. If I am not mistaken Nokia discontinue the Symbian OS after this phone and focus on their Maemo or something like that.", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$469.00", "Features": "What's in the Box: handset, Nokia Navigation Accessory Kit ( mobile holder, holder easy mount), rechargeable battery, charger, connectivity cable, headset, lanyard, pouch, printed documentation\nUp to 12.5 hours of GSM talk time (5.9 on 3G networks), up to 576 hours (24 days) of standby time\nPush e-mail and calendars via Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes Traveler; full QWERTY keyboard with Optical Navi key for more intuitive navigation\nUnlocked quad-band GSM cell phone compatible with 850/900/1800/1900 frequencies and US/International 3G compatibility via 850/1900/2100 UMTS/HSDPA plus GPRS/EDGE capabilities\nGPS with free Ovi Maps navigation plus Navigation Accessory Kit; 5-megapixel camera/camcorder; stereo Bluetooth; Wi-Fi networking (802.11b/g)", "Name": "Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hmy8NeW3L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002QEBM96"}}
