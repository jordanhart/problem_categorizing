No problem connecting to my local Caribbean Network.  No issues with it so far.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone. Works fine in S. America on Movistar, Tigo & Claro 3G networks and in U.S on AT&T; 3G.", "Author": "KC", "ReviewID": "R3A8JWDEX2PXXK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 3 1/2\" screen (size of I Phone) was to small, the G3 was to large and the S3-MINI, well a perfect size to read, write and keep in a pants or shirt pocket. Speed is fast in 3G, just DO NOT load your phone up with every app you find or you can experience some major slowing. This is not a 3g Mini issue, this applies to any smart phone on the market.As the title states, this phone WILL work on 3G in South America using MOVISTAR, TIGO or CLARO. I travel there quite a bit and tested this phone on my last trip using each of the three companies Sim chips. The 3G data was transmitted on the 850 band width. Just make sure your phone is the \"L\" model. I have found the 3G speeds to be fine for GPS directions and turn by turn mapping while driving. No phone freezing or lag time.In the U.S, this phone will work in 3G on AT&T;, either a contract or \" Go Phone\". IT WILL NOT WORK WITH T-MOBILE in 3G data. It will work with T-Mobile on their 2G bands.Battery life is good and the screen is bright and clear. Speakers are loud and clear for calls and I have had no problems with the listener being able to understand me. A car charger is a must have if you drive.This phone has the SAMSUNG-DIVE anti theft software installed so you can easily track your phone, lock it or wipe you data in the event it is lost or stolen. This service is FREE since it is a Samsung device. Go to SAMSUNGDIVE.COM to get all the technical info about how this service works.Another thing I like about this phone is NO branded locked in software that you can't remove. No branding so you don't get any carrier start up screens.We purchased three of these phones. One for my wife, one for me and a spare.SWYPE & DRAGON. This is a must have program in my opinion. SWYPE is fast for typing and DRAGON is lightning fast (and accurate) converting speech to text. Great for emails and texting. These programs work great on this phone.Have not found any negatives with this phone yet and don't expect any. For under $300.00 this is a great value, nice feature set. Samsung put just the right amount of apps on this phone that 90% of people will find themselves using. No useless junk ware.I am not a gamer, so I can't speak to gaming on this phone with regards to game speeds or screen freeze.As far as repair work, it is important to know that the major carriers in S. America DO SELL the G3 Mini (i8190L) so in the event you needed a new screen or other service work, they should have the parts and technical data available to work on your phone.Only thing to add would be to get yourself a good screen protector and a case that protects the corners in the event you should drop it.So get it and start enjoying it.

The color \"Grey Titanium\" makes the phone look very elegant.The screen is bright and shiny, and the touch system responds great. However, I was able to see that it is a little slower than the iphone 4s, it takes a little longer to open and close applications, load web pages through 3g etc. It does it very good, but it is noticeable.The camera is EXTREMELY good. The day pictures with little light or flash , come out great. The videos are also excellent quality. The only thing I don't like about the camera is that it takes too long to focus; when there is minimal movement, it is extremely easy for the picture to come out blurry.Everything else is great. Since it is unlocked and due to the frequencies the phone works with, I can use a Mexican simcard or USA simcard without a problem.For the price, it's one of the best phones you can purchase.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone! but...", "Author": "Sandra Aguilar", "ReviewID": "R2LOLIAXZMLHO8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a phone that isnt as big as the s3 galaxy or s4 galaxy, this is it! takes great pictures, and has a lot of great features just as the other 2 phones.UPDATEdd REVIEWFor anyone wondering if this phone will work outside of USA make sure you do get the product you ordered. i have been living in USA and the phone worked fine with ATT, but now that i am back in HONDURAS this phone turns out does not have a 850 frecuency. also the name of the item has an L and the item i received did not have the same name. I caught these issues a little late so i doubt i can return the item, but pretty much its useless to me as it only works with EDGE with my network provider TIGO and it is tediously slow and sometimes i even have to connect it with WIFI at home or anywhere else i go because its horribly slow. I will have to end up buying a phone here at home which is a bit expensive and have to figue out how to get rid of this phone as i doubt anyone will buy it from me because it only works with edge...
