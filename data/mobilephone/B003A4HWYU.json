{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cool alternative to iPhone", "Author": "M. Jecha", "ReviewID": "R1YOQJ9VMJBY4B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the BackFlip since the day it was released and I'm having fun exploring all the functions.  I'm so glad that I went to see the phone for myself rather than relying on reviews from the various geek sites.  Several claimed that the phone is crippled and limited which made me quite apprehensive.  However, for my needs, it fits the bill so far.I had a short list of \"have to have\" features:Good signal - Check - I've experienced better signal than my Samsung windows mobile phoneTouch screen - Check - pretty large, given the small phone sizeKeypad - Check - Larger keys than my last phone, great for texting and browsing!Decent camera - Check - 5.0MP baby!  With flash!  Again, better than last phoneMulti-window Web browser - Check - Up to 4, plenty for me.  Changed home page to Google and I'm good to go!Apps - Check - Market has large assortment and I've downloaded several already. Enjoying bar code reader and Amazon apps.SD Expansion - Check - up to 32GBI'm new to the Android, but I like the intuitive interface, plus Motoblur and the weather, calendar and message widgets, but I'm sure I'm just scratching the surface.  I'm not one to indiscriminately download software all over the web, so open access outside the Market is not a deal breaker for me.  The one complaint I'd have is that I'd like to get rid of some of the preloaded AT&T; apps that I won't use...or at least find a way to hide them, but I can work around that till I figure something out.Bottom line, love the phone and I don't miss the things that others have complained about.  I'm a geek, but apparently not as geeky as some.  It cost me less than the windows mobile phone I had, plus has better features, it's lighter, faster AND IT'S NOT an iPhone, so it's all good!", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Start", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R36CORXUWAQ5M5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd like to correct something another reviewer said.  You can actually install applications from the web.  I tested one of these phones out in the store and successfully downloaded, installed, and ran the Pandora application.  The phone has a really nice interface.  The touch screen seemed responsive and intuitive, and the navigation not difficult to figure out.  Yes, like all other AT&T; phones, this comes with some applications pre-loaded, but you can also expand the memory on this to 32GB, so it would be an exaggeration to claim that these few items affect the usability of the phone.  I hope to receive the one I ordered this week and will leave a more in-depth review then, but don't let a few gut reactions dissuade you from trying this phone for yourself.Now that I've had it a few days, I have to say I'm very glad I got it.  The only real issue I've had so far was in transferring my contacts.  For some reason, when I tried to copy them all from my old SIM I only got one number per person and no other related data (birthdays, addresses, etc.).  So I am still working on fixing that little issue, but the rest of the phone is great.  I've installed a number of other applications with no problems, and for those of you concerned that you cannot install anything from outside of the Android market, do a little research and I'm sure you'll find a way around that issue.  Personally, I haven't yet found a need for that.As the the things I love, I'll start with five customizable home screens.  Having the ability to make this look however I want with the shortcuts, widgets, and background I choose is awesome, and puts this heads above the iPhone in my opinion.  I personally always hated having to scroll through the multiple screens on the iPhone just to find the one thing I wanted.  The ability to have everything about a contact show up in one place no matter how many different accounts that person has and different ways I communicate with them is amazing and another way I feel this beats the iPhone hands-down, and the \"happenings\" widget that displays it all real-time is designed to make it all very intuitive.  The ability to make this into a nice alarm clock by opening it at a 90 degree angle is very cool and came in quite handy when traveling this past weekend... especially the fact that not only did it show the time, but the current weather/temperature conditions as well.  The integration with all my various accounts (social, email, photos, etc.) is so useful and seemless that I already can barely imagine how I lived without it.  The 5 megapixel camera and integrated flash are nice and can take some amazing pictures outside (and inside if you can hold your hands steady), and the ability to directly upload those photos to picassa, facebook, emails, etc. makes this feature even better.  Having the camera integrated into the keyboard seems a little odd at first, but makes taking self-portraits so much easier, and having it record your location from the integrated GPS while taking the photos is very nice!  The flash is crazy bright though, and the response time is a bit slower that I'd like so it probably won't fully replace my digital camera, but as a phone, I never expected that it would.  Battery life so far has been pretty good.  I've been running numerous applications on it while testing it out this first week, but I would say the drain seems about right for that.  I'm sure once the novelty wears off a bit and I stop messing with it every few minutes it will last much longer, but I would say the specs seem about right.Overall, it's a strong product.  The interface can be a bit laggy at times, but so can all the other phones out there when you're running as many applications simultaneously as I have been.  The buttons and placement of things is taking some getting used to, but I have no real complaints over the design of the phone.  If it weren't for the extra work I've had to put in to get my contacts copied from my old phone I'd have given a full 5 stars.  Honestly though, if you're like me and have been waiting for a good alternative to the iPhone on AT&T; that had actual buttons, this is a good choice.  The Android OS is very user friendly and there are already lots of applications out there for you to try out.---------------Update 3/17/10------------------I have had to contact support to send back the phone after an overheating incident yesterday has rendered the product completely non-functional.  I am hoping this is an isolated incident, but it's very early in the release of the unit to tell for sure.", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Continues to be a great smartphone!", "Author": "HDS \"stewcanoe\"", "ReviewID": "R213YQK4H8WVFB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE NUMBER 2 :DEven happier with this phone now than I was before!  I have gotten used to using it and it is like second nature.  The little touchpad is a life saver.  (Discussed below...) A few other things I have noticed are:1. that the phone is narrow enough to easily reach all areas of the screen with your thumb while holding the phone normally.  On my old phone you had to either use two hands or wallow the phone around in your hand to get your thumb on everything.  Though the screen is physically smaller on the Backflip, it is much easier to use and navigate on.2. The phone and screen are very durable.  Mine survived a serious drop of about 10 feet while I was on a ladder.  (Yeah yeah.  I know.  I shouldn't have been using my phone while climbing on a ladder.)  Anyway, I dropped the phone onto concrete.  The plastic was scuffed up a bit but has had no detrimental effect on the phone.3. I can play YouTube videos.  Evidently iPhone (or the Safari browser) cannot.So after 6 months I can say I am still very very happy with the Backflip.  I will post another update once the Android software update rolls out.UPDATE :)I have now had the phone a few months and can still say that I am as pleased with this phone as I have been with anything I have ever bought.  It has turned out to be a great smartphone.  The apps store may have something to do with that.  You can download video players, office tools, games, etc...  Even some pretty decent E6B flight calculators!  There are a couple of apps I suggest you download right off the bat.  The first is Advanced Task Killer from Rechild, or another tool to manage apps.  The apps killer lets you shut down apps without having to go to each one and close it down individually.  While multi-tasking is great, you can end up with quite a few apps running in the background.  Advanced Task Killer lets you manage them more efficiently than you would using the default tools.  A good file manager also helps.  OI File is a good one.  Another good app is Save MMS, which lets you save photos attached to messages.  There are also a number of good games and music players.  Many of them very inexpensive or even free!  Anyway, I liked the phone before, and I like it even better now.  The only thing I can think of that needs improvement, is the voice dialing, (mentioned below).Original review:I have to admit that this phone took a bit of getting used to.  I have had it now about a month and couldn't be happier.  My previous smart phone worked great as a phone and to text, but sucked at everything else. Anyway, the AT&T; sales agent said this phone was targeted at the \"online generation\" with a lot of features for Facebook, twitter, email, etc.  And it has all that.  Motoblur is not just ad hype.  It syncs it all.  But not only is the Backflip great for all that stuff, it is a very capable business phone as well.  It has completely replaced my old phone and my iPaq.  And works better than both.Anyway, here is my rating system.  Great :D  Good :)  Average :|  Poor :/  Bad :(WEIGHT AND DURABILITY :)The phone is fairly lightweight.  Heavier than some other phones, but still easy enough to carry.  It feels very well built and solid.  Does not have that flimsy feel some other phones have.  Nice and narrow.  Fairly thin but a little thicker than some other texting phones.BATTERY LIFE :)Normally, I can go two days before charging.  If I turn on the WiFi while at work, then I have to charge every night.  I have never needed to charge the battery during the day.  Motorola does not include a car charger, but it accepts micro-USB chargers which can be found inexpensively just about anywhere.OS and SYNCING :)The Backflip runs on Android.  Completely different than Windows Mobile.  It doesn't have anything like Windows ActiveSync, but you can use Google sync. After a little work I installed Google sync which works very well.  Syncing occurs over the air so no cables to plug in.  I also like being able to attach the phone as a USB storage device.  When you plug your phone into a USB port you can choose to attach as USB or charge only.  It disconnects the SIM card when used as a USB but it has come in handy a couple of times.  The SIM automatically restarts when you unplug the USB cable.  You have to buy AT&T;'s data plan, but the phone is WiFi capable, which speeds up internet browsing experience.STORAGE:  The phone accepts microSD cards.  Mine came with a 2GB card included.POWER ON AND SCREEN LOCK :)The screen lock function is simple and works one handed.  Press the power button, then tap on the unlock area.  If you choose a security code, that also can be entered one handed as the numbers are large and easy to tap on.  Unfolding the phone also turns it on.PHONE :DLeave it folded and it works like most other touch screen phones.  Apps come up on the screen and you tap to activate.  Tapping the phone icon brings up a very simple and easy to use dialer.  One handed phone use is the norm.  This phone is made for thumb dialing.  The narrow size and large numbers make it very easy to use.  On this screen you can also select recent calls, speed dial, or frequently called numbers.  Sound quality is superb and as a speaker phone it ranks with the best.  The volume can be turned up very high.  (Sound gets a little gravely at full volume but still good.)  I have not had any dropped calls.  I have seen a lot of complaints about AT&T;'s network but I can't say I have ever had a problem. So I don't know if this is something specific to the phone or the network.  Anyway, I have not had a problem.TEXTING and KEYBOARD :DUnfold the keyboard and it makes a great texting phone.  With my previous phone I found having a real keyboard, (no matter how small) dramatically increases the usability of texting.  At least for me. You can develop a feel for where letters and numbers are that I just never got with the touchscreen keyboards.  The only complaint I have is that the numbers are tucked up against the top and you have to be very deliberate when pressing them.  Still this is a great keyboard.  I like the feel and it is spread out enough that even my fat fingers have no trouble.  The virtual screen keyboard is OK, but I find the real keyboard better.APPS :DThere are plenty of apps on the Android Market, and finding and installing them is a piece of cake.  I use spreadsheets a lot and I was able to download the same program for this phone that I used on my old phone.  Editing documents is also easy using the keyboard.  Plus there are all the usual pre-installed run of the mill apps: calendar, calculator, etc...  They all work just like you expect them to.TOUCHPAD?!? WTF?!?! :DSpeaking of spreadsheets, there is this strange little touch pad on the back of the touch screen that you use just like a touch pad on a laptop.  I thought it was weird at first, but I have come to love it.  It makes scrolling around a spreadsheet a joy.  Much easier than swiping or using the arrow keys.  I know some people who think it's a waste, but I like it.  Nice job Motorola.MP3 PLAYER :)It makes a pretty good music device.  Sound is good but I thought it got a little gravely at close to full volume.  Even with earbuds.  I do like the AT&T; radio.  Actually works very well.  Makes up for not having an FM radio built in.  Ringtones are MP3 as well.  Lots of apps for those.CAMERA and VIDEO :)There is a 5 MP camera and a video capture app.  The camera works well and has the best flash I have seen on a camera phone.  Prints from the phone pics are very sharp. The video seems to work well but I haven't really used it that much.  Still it's neat to have.MULTITASKING :)You can run multiple apps on the phone while making a call.  I did it just to see if it worked.  I don't know that this is a great advantage but you can do it.  It can get confusing pretty fast.VOICE DIALING :(Motorola claims that this phone has voice dialing capability.  I could not get it to work well enough to be useful.  They could not get it to work well at the AT&T; store either.  I will miss voice dialing, as my old phone had pretty good voice dialing capability.  Voice dialing on this phone just doesn't seem to work well.  Very poor recognition.  (Just browse on AT&T;'s support site and you can find a lot of other Backflip users with the same complaint.)  I would rate voice dialing on this phone as bad.  It is so bad that I think Motorola should not even pretend they offer it.SCREEN PROTECTION :)It has a glass screen.  Nice, but because the phone flips backwards (leaving both the keyboard and screen exposed) I suggest you use a screen and keyboard protector.  Being glass, the screen shouldn't scratch easily but I feel better with a cover on it anyway. Motorola offers a two piece cover that works well for less than $10.00.  I am using one that the AT&T; store threw in for free when I got the phone. Does not seem to affect the touch screen sensitivity and keeps the keys up off the surface when you lay it down.  I do not use a case.  I just drop the phone in my pocket.CLOCK :DAnother neat feature that is a bit different, is that when unfolded halfway and plugged into charge the phone becomes a bedside alarm clock.  Not just a phone with an alarm, but a classy looking bedside alarm clock.  Pretty nifty. It also has all the normal clock and alarm functions.OVERALL :)In summery, this is first and foremost, a really good phone.  It also makes for a nice tool to manage your online stuff.  A pretty good music player.  A very capable business tool.  A good game device.  Nice camera and video camera. A very nice alarm clock. And a great texting phone.  Once you get used to it, I think you will like it.  The only feature that is below par, (especially for Motorola) is the voice dialing.Anyway, this is a \"different\" type of phone.  But different isn't always bad.  In this case it's great.  Good job Motorola.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "george", "ReviewID": "R5LAPO9AXYVPC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "**Android 2.1 Update (Nov 12)**It's out! I've had it for about a week now. In addition to the things that just come with Android 2.1 (eg, updated browser and maps, navigation, etc), Motorola also improved a few things. First and foremost, Yahoo! is gone, for those that prefer Google. (If you prefer Yahoo!, well ... I guess that's a con.) The battery charge indicator LED now can also function as a notification LED (you need to enable it in settings first). The screenlock screen is a bit different now, and turns on every time you wake the phone, regardless of how long the screen has been off. This keeps the phone from pocket-dialing (see cons, below). The Motoblur widgets look different now, though I'm not sure if they function any different than they used to. I did notice that Happenings uses a lot less cpu than it used to. They also added a few widgets, like toggles for Airplane mode, Wifi, BT, etc. Many people report improved performance, but I haven't noticed any. Battery performance seems about the same as on 1.5.I should also point out that there are no Live Wallpapers or multitouch. The wallpapers were disabled for performance reasons, and touchscreen hardware never supported multitouch in the first place (unlike the Droid's touchscreen).**Old Review**I wasn't looking for much in a phone: a webkit-based browser, a gps, a full qwerty physical keyboard. If I wasn't so sick of BB's Browser I might have gotten a Bold 9700, but the only phone on AT&T;'s network at the time that fit the bill was the Backflip (there are more options now). Most mainstream reviews of the phone were bad, but there just wasn't much in the way of alternatives, so I went to the store, tried it out. Since it seemed ok, picked it up anyway.I have now had this phone for about 8 months. There are a lot of reviews of it around the internet, so I'll try not to rehash too much of what's already in those reviews.Pros:* Battery life is fine, though I find myself having to kill certain resource-hungry apps constantly (Market and Browser are the biggest offenders). It will last through a whole day (possibly two, depending on usage) on one charge, but not much longer than that.* It's pretty small* Keyboard is huge, especially for a phone this size, and is made from a single piece of plastic without seams (resists water and dust better than BBs). Still, some doming in the horizontal direction would have been appreciated.* Screen is pretty nice (160dpi); similar to the iPhone3G/Pre's but not as good as, say, the Droid's.* Gorilla Glass screen (no screen protector needed)* Dual microphones for background noise cancellation* Call quality/reception is fantastic, even in my apartment, where signal is usually poor* I don't use Motoblur widgets, but the Motoblur service itself is pretty snazzy (contact aggregation, linking, and backup); it is functionally identical to Palm's Synergy.* Remote wipe (via Motoblur)* It's an Android phone (obvious, I know)Cons:* Sideloading is possible, but cumbersome* Cannot reorder any lists (folder contents, bookmarks, etc)* Browser UI could use some improvement* Not as configurable as the Pearl (menus, email ... basically everything)* Only pushes from MS Exchange (typical for non-BBs, I think)* When you have the keyboard flipped out, if you turn off the display and close the keyboard quickly, the screen will turn back on. This used to make it pocket-dial all the time (see 2.1 update, above).* No track-ball/pad when phone is closed (obvious, right?)* Cons from other reviews (UI occasionally hangs, non-removable AT&T; cruft, etc)Conclusions:For the price, I think the phone is pretty good. It's not the cutting edge Android phone that nerds stuck on AT&T; have been clamoring for, but it also isn't priced like one. The novel design allows for a large keyboard, which is a big plus in my book (I can't stand software keyboards). I really love the fact that Motoblur pulled contact info (including profile pictures) from my Facebook and email accounts. More than that, all your contact info (including manually entered data like contact linking) is backed up on Motorola's servers, so if you ever wipe or reset the phone, fully restoring your contacts is just a Motoblur login away. The phone's flaws are not fatal, in my opinion, and in fact it performs better than I expected it to, based on mainstream news reviews.Notes:* If you don't know what sideloading is, then it isn't important to you.* SD card is hot-swappable (yay!), but it's in the battery compartment (boo!).* The keyboard is recessed and only lightly domed, so if you lay it on a flat surface, it won't scratch.* I kind of like backtrack, though it'd be a lot more useful if I could use it in portrait orientation. Unfortunately, that isn't physically possible. With that in mind, I think an optical trackpad like on HTC Desire or the BB Bolds would have been better.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good phone misunderstood, Lazy reviewers", "Author": "M.

Its free and it will switch your settings when your battery starts to drain.  Any phone will not last if you have the screen at its highest brightness, and GPS on all the time.Moto Blur - Its a social program on top of the Android system and it can be intrusive when you dont want it.

Anyway, if you see your screen doesn't look right, it properly it is not right. I am really disappointed that it won't allow untrust provider software to install, it is because of ATT not Google. Verizon Droids allows it. And I slammed with 50 bucks unlimited data and text plan. That was a little surprise because I didn't read the fine print.I used to have my O2 Atom Life for last 3 years. Love it and hate it.Love it because it does everything I want it to do. Really everything. Millions of apps out there: certify & non-certify. Hate it because it is windows and it crashes and need reboot freq. 3 times I had to do a clear boot and lost all the data which is not fun at all.Besides after 3 years of plug in and out, the USB and the headset plug starts loosing.

I often accidentally touch them. I wish they were hard buttons so I can use that space to hold the phone.Added 3/26/2010: I found that whenever I use the phone's camera, the phone reboots. Sometimes it happens after taking 2 photos, sometimes after 5 photos. Using the camcorder will reboot the phone also. Very repeatable.

So, and in order to be fair, I will give 3 starts but I'll explain all the pros and cons I have experience so far. Yes! I own one ... and had no previous smart phone myself but wife has a Blackberry and couple of coworkers iPhones and other Blackberry too.Pros:Good Operating system (relatively fast), bunch of free and nice applications because Android is open source, nice design, good reception (so far) and good quality of voice and sound, sturdy not not too heavy, touch screen is responsive and sensitive, free online backup of all contacts, free GPS localization in case of lostCons:Because the position of the keyboard, when closed will always be facing down which I assume over the years will deteriorate the keys (speculation here), blooded with non-free/open source AT&T; apps, restarted couple of times and clock crashed a few also, battery life could be betterMy experience so far after 5 days of heavy useUsage and common cellphone featuresThe menus and the way the Os works is really easy to understand; it will take 1 hour or less to get familiar with the location of things or how to close, open or find anything like a widget or application. We do have speakerphone, and fully integration of social networks or FB with the Address book so you will save tons of time adding numbers and contacts. Screen goes off when talking but if you move the cell away from your head, turns on I guess is because the integrated GPS accelerator; cool feature, saves some battery.Applications and WidgetsI checked the iPhone too when checking for this one and based on what I've seen so far on the AT&T; store and on friend's iPhones, I do not like the idea of specific store to get apps or having to pay all the time for simple stuff. I use Ubuntu Linux at home (the laptop I am using for this review) and after being in contact with how Open Source works I do not want to go back and continue paying for crappy software. Anyway, that is cool of Android: tons of nice apps that expand the cellphone capability. Some that I have downloaded so far, open source (free)-Chess-TexasHold'em (you can play online as well, lol )-Pandora (listen radio music free, your favorite artist)-Open Search (replace the Yahoo widget for search - personal preference but I do not like Yahoo)-Task Killer-Ring Toggle <-- really nice, let you switch from ring to vibrate to silent in just 1 actionInternetAssuming you have unlimited Internet access you can start enjoining the main benefits of a smart phone once activated. Here is when some people confuse Internet speed with Os speed. There is no reason to blame the cellphone itself but if your Internet experience is not the best, is because AT&T; network. On that topic, not disappointed but my UVERSE at home of course is way much faster. But, fast enough to use google map, retrieve emails, post on facebook or read news. You can also open or have 4 browser' windows which is kind of nice as well.Cellphone layout and feelingLike I said before, the keyboard will be exposed all the time when closed. I minimized that issue buying a keyboard and screen protector from AT&T; store. I am sure you can find similar on ebay. It will protect some way the keyboard and the touch screen too. Money well spent giving the case retail price (before rebates) is about $300.00 I do also like the cellphone's feeling. Does not feel cheap, like other people say. Keys are big enough in my opinion and texting is a blast.Minor flaws1st day, when I tried to play around with the clock feature when semi folded and plugged, clock crashed. That happened to me several times. It could be an operating system bug or the battery saving feature interfering with the app. itself, no idea. But, did not happen again and it is not a big deal for me either.The cellphone uses battery like crazy. If you are a Facebook or Internet addict :-) ...you will be in troubles. But for reasonable Internet usage, like 1 hr or so during the day, lunch time maybe, battery should last until end of business day. Just be sure you are not using lot of widgets or app behind scenes, that is one of the major reasons for running out of battery soon. The TaskKiller widget I mentioned above helps you on that and it is free/open source. You can also turn the screen off immediately pressing the power button once and quickly. That will NOT turns the cellphone off but the screen, saving priceless battery life.In a short, it is a nice smart phone and great alternative for iPhones or Blackberry. I personally do not like either those, because they are not open source Os and the Blackberry Os is slower compared to Android ... go to a store, and you will see ...", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love the phone, very upset with AT&T;", "Author": "Charles Trotter", "ReviewID": "R166TO405QMLC9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Very happy with the phone... very upset with AT&T.;  When I was looking for a phone, what I was really looking for was a replacement for my old Palm TX PDA, which was beginning a slow death.  The new smartphones could do everything my old Palm could, so I started looking at them.I needed three things in my phone:1)  It had to have a keyboard and I do a fair amount of typing while on the go.2)  It had to have WiFi.  I needed to be able to access the internet and I didn't want to eat up cell phone time to do it.3)  I needed a plan that was relatively inexpensive.I narrowed my options down to the Motorola Backflip (through AT&T;) and the HTC myTouch Slide (through T-mobile).  The the slide looked like it might be a better phone, it had a few dissadvantages.  It came without a microSD card.  The phone itself was more money than I wanted to pay up front ([...]).  T-mobiles plan was almost twice the cost of AT&T;'s.Most places, the Backflip costs [...] with a 2-year contract, and then a [...] activation fee, but here on Amazon the activation fee is waived and the phone costs 1-cent.  I went with the backflip.The Backflip has the features I want:  a keyboard, WiFi, Android OS, sharp looking.  Though it comes with Android 1.5, they will be providing upgrades to Android 2.1.  The web browser (which I use a lot) is much better than the browser I had on my Palm and seems quick and smooth.  The telephone itself works great, however the speakerphone is not of the best quality, but quite usable.One bad thing about the phone, the buttons around the outset edge take some getting use to.  When holding the phone, I would sometimes hit a button by accident, but once you get use to it, it becomes a non-issue.My BIGGEST problem was not with the phone at all, but with AT&T.;  AT&T; has decided to \"protect\" you, the user, from nasty, vicious applications by not allowing you to install non-market applications.  What does this mean?  I have been using [...] for years to buy books and read them on my Palm.  eReader has an Android version of their reader, which I downloaded on my Backflip, but then was unable to install it because it was a \"security\" risk and was from an unknown vender.  You can ONLY get programs that are on the Android Market.  I was livid.However, there is a way around this for those of you who are computer savy.  If you go to Motorola's forum or do a google search for \"install non market app backflip\" you'll find a way around this problem.  For those of you who are not computer savy, you'll have to make due with what's in the Android Market, or look at a phone from another carrier.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best smartphone for my needs", "Author": "Antonio Roldan Fernandez", "ReviewID": "R2APRM8RNTOAU0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As easy as this:Pros:- Smaller package than iPhone or Droid.

This phone, when crashes and reboots takes forever! shutdown is about 2 seconds. reboot, according to a person who timed it (and mine is near the same amount of time) 1 min 44sec. it's painstakingly slow boot. even my iphone booted faster then that!So I got this phone to replace my iPhone that didn't survive a high velocity fall to the concrete. So I got it March 7th, I wasn't planning on buying this phone originally but a Sony Ericsson. I just happened to be at the mall and I remembered one of the reps at AT&T; store talking about this phone a few weeks back when I was asking about renewing my contract.So I did renew my contract and paid 199 + case, screen protector and I don't regret it. This phone, is a bit sluggish at times, breezes through most tasks with out a hitch. Though Moto Blur is still, imo, in the works, it's pretty smooth with the occasional crash. Facebook, twitter, myspace, google stuff are all streamlined to this app that broadcasts news on the main screen. Anyway that's constantly on facebook or twitter would appreciate this phone (i do) tho I don't like twitter as much on the phone, it works.Now like most people said, you can't remove the preloaded junk software like AT&T; navigator, radio, etc that you pay an extra premium price for. There are plenty of apps, not as much as the iPhone but a pretty good collection, games is so so.Now the phone itself, for the price you're paying, is a bargain, even at retail price of sub 400 it is worth it. Android platform is faster than windows mobile 6.5, and somewhat comparable to the iphone. touchscreen is one of the best so far (besides iPhone, i wasn't a fan of my iPhone but I still attempt to zoom on other phones with the same way as the iPhone -_-\" ) the keyboard is, AMAZING. OMG that's probably the best thing about this phone (5mp camera and captures video too) (micro SD expansion up to 32gb comes with 2gb). I have big hands and this phone feels perfect. It's a little smaller then the iPhone and about twice as thick. GPS is great, even knows the direction ur facing. Did i mention that there is a standard headphone plugin? and built in speakers ^__^. A random feature that I find amusing is the alarm clock, when plugged in, displays as an alarm clock tho i'm not really sure if i want my screen on every night for long periods of time, it's a cool feature.Now the cons.Battery life is questionable, certain apps can kill the battery in 6 hrs (pandora on for 6 hrs) and sometimes it's hard to tell if an app is running in the background. the touch button layout on the main screen (not keyboard) where the back, home, and secondary is, sometimes unresponsive, and a bit annoying when you have a bit of lag and you double click the home button and the shortcut (default is voice command) pops up. This phone does lag at times and it's frustrating to even make a phone call where the delay is over a minute. Motorola will not tell you when they do server upgrades and there was one day where android market (app downloads) and any app based internet communication were halted by the server maintenance. It is unknown WHEN they (motorola) will upgrade the phone to android 2.1, but possibly soon as the droid is going through it's upgrade earlier.if you want a bang for the buck smartphone, consider this phone. It's not for everyone, but for young adults and teenagers who love social networking, this fits the bill.!!!!EDIT!!!!It's been 2 months since I had this phone... and it's crashing a lot. I txt a lot and I think that's overwhelmed the inbox (i try to keep it pretty empty) but it keeps crashing every so often and lags loading txt msgs. unlike the iphone where it saves then archives past txts. this thing just piles it up. Everyone txts ok or k or lol or yeah (stupid one word txt) and that just adds more lag. tip, keep your inbox clear. my main crashes happen in motoblur.txting or what ever.now i regret buying this phone, it has one of the fastest internet, but at&t; limited to the point where i'm holding something that isn't really open sourced. i haven't figured out how to tether and i'm not a smartphone programmer or genius so... i'm just going to switch phones. i love the keyboard and the concepts of this phone, but overall... they need to fix or upgrade the software soon.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Dare I say, worth the ball and chain ?", "Author": "willPS", "ReviewID": "R60GF2PJLF15W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, replaced the G1, which had a rough year.  On paper, they're a lot alike.  But in only one area does the backflip not trounce the G1: keyboard.  And this was expected by me.  And instantly offset by the headphone jack.  Instantly.  Everything else, it beats the G1 more than the specs would suggest.First thing I did was remove all the blur crap widget by superfluous widget.  The phone was pretty laggy out of the box with all of that.  But, surprise surprise, it's pretty smooth without it.Hardware/Function- Clock mode is cool (bonus!).  The screen responsiveness: quite respectable.  Heft and feel, very good.  In the hand, this is where I was surprised.  The feel of the store dummy models is more what I was expecting.  Something more.. Fisher-Pricey, if you will.  Why does this 3.5mm jack seem like the best ever?  I don't know but it goes along with an enjoyable feel of unexpected quality.  It's not something I want to drop, if that makes sense as a compliment.  Keyboard: functional.  I miss my row of number keys probably most of all.  Audio quality might not quite be as spatial as my iPod with my Senn HD555's, but hey, it's tolerable (read: good enough to justify not carrying both).  The camera is another area where I felt I just got a freebie.  I mean, it's pretty damn good.  I just realized I hadn't tested the flash, so I did.  And it's pretty impressive, far beyond my expectations(which didn't take it into account as much).  Call quality: obscenely good.  It seems like 1080p calling; pardon the shorthand mis-nomenclature.  The speaker phone is also something new to me, as the g1 was *horrendous in terms of volume.  It's a decent speaker, and if it was 3x as loud, it'd be a boombox.  Wow another feature I forget to mention but am impressed by: the touchpad on the back.  It's a suitable trackball replacement.  It gets a little loud when it clicks over link web URL's 100 times fast, and you can turn that off.  It works, is ingenious, double clicks, and saves some fingerprints.  It takes some practice NOT to use it sometimes, but hey, that's why it's YOUR phone.  And ahhhh PDA net! merciful heavans!  What an over-achiever of a human creation.  Try and you'll see.  PDA net has been a proud sponsor of this boradcast. :)Next, Gripes: and all are mostly software related.  Hardware wise, it can be tricky to hang up a call.  Blame it on the fall of the old button-based phones, but this one seems tough.  In fact, I'm probably better off typing a text message while driving than fussing trying to hang up too much.  It's not intuitive, and you'll be hard-pressed to enlighten me as to why the lock/power button doesn't hang up (a software issue).  Be careful with the sensor that senses you're holding it to your ear.  If your finger is over it, it will dim, and lock the phone.  So you repeat.  This happened like 4x consecutively before I finally caught it.  It's near the M logo top left of screen.Software gripes: far more plentiful. yahoo search bothers me not.  I always forgot the whole search button anyway.  It caused me to DL an effective replacement that actually causes me to think to use it.  Brightness of the buttons has been mentioned negatively in their lack of control (software), a gripe with a degree of merit.  But, the abomination is the AT&T; bundled software.  I can't wait until I purge it entirely.  It's days are numbered...  How rude to Steve-Jobsify this open source platform in this way.  AT&T; navigator??  Is this a joke sitting here next to my google maps?  Here's a good time to mention that apparently, according to the rep's solicitation, ATT somehow tries to charge a monthly fee for GPS.  This confounding notion is clearly aimed at the ignorant, and based on the knowledge that the chip is in (my) phone, I have yet to demystify this convoluted message.  I assume its related to 2 or three pieces of trash, the navigation-related apps with bad icons that I can't get rid of.  The ATT navigator is an obnoxious app which I opened once, saw some terms of service crap, and immediately killed, but it came back.. many times.  Yes, task killer, a must have.  ATT finds it fun to make their apps like a merry go round, because they always come back around, and lag the phone just enough for you to realize it's time for a bit of maintenance in the form of the task killer.  Really though, why is it \"ATT Music player\"?  It's not even coded by them.  Why yellow pages with a EULA?  YP (was) in the app store.  Where is gesture search?  Why five homescreens, is that supposed to lure my business?  No, it's a nuisance.  Until the phone runs the Adobe suite of software, good luck trying to convince me I need 5 homescreens.  Maybe if I was dumb enough to keep all the stock widgets loaded.  What I really need is an app to purge all of this garbage, and alert me when something is unused enough to add to my hitlist.  Another nuisance, the brushed-adonized-black aluminum pseudo-retro-limpwristed-grunge look, and red buttons that I have to assume came from the droid.  It's not compelling from a design standpoint, but considering I have better things to do with that extra couple KB of memory, unwanted.  Also overdone is text-messaging interface.  I like spoilers for downforce...  and yet they are going for the stock-neon-with-the-3-ft-spoiler personna.  Then the icons, who is responsible.  The fact I'm actually looking now is an issue, because when you look, they're just no good, and some (esp ATT's) are really elementary.  Worse actually.  Comparing them ATM to the HTC G1, there's not a single one I prefer on the backflip, and this isn't just habit.  They're not distractingly horrendous, well that wallpaper one is!! wow.  And, I have considered trying to port my G1 sounds for their.. unintrusive and functional tones.  Niggles for sure, but, uh, do they need a graphics designer?  Looking at that clock, those BAD att icons, I think I'm their man... and I have yet to learn the software.  It only aids in the unfortunate effect of reminding of ATT's influence.  Anyhow... if they want a lesson in what needs to be in \"mobile graphics\" for a phone somewhere within sight of its max, Arity calculator.  Finally, this thing is a pocket dialing fiend.  It's software.  I want to KILL the phone app every time I hang up, but instead it does something retarded like going to recent calls, and I actually JUST pocket dialed my friend after hanging up and placing the phone on a desk.  So desk dialed.  There was almost no contact with the screen AT ALL after I put it down.  Frankly I'm still mystified.  Also for those poor \"E\"s in my phone book, they get it once a week.  The hardware button that locks the phone should also KILL instantly the phone app.  You won't mis-hit it while talking, that's for sure.At&t; are kinda nazi-fied with their policies ie not offering one year plans, not selling data plans to any phone at all without two year contract, fairly large down payments, and the iPhone was no lure enough to commit to their BS.  But, at $99 for a decent android phone, I was in.  And for $.01!! Yeah, do it.  On paper the backflip isn't uber-impressive, and if you're into heavy uber-networking on a constant basis, THEN it might not work, but for everyone else..Overall, having a phone for two years is stretching it in this tech-heavy era, especially considering the new gen is pushing desktop performance of five years ago.  I feel like the people responsible for the hardware squeezed water from the stone which was likely their budget and delivered a thorough rendition of the above-average components.  Then, unfortunately, someone let the software people in the building.  What do you get? (GOOD) internet for it and anything around it, a GOOD camera with satisfactory video, MUSIC, good communication 4 ways, sudoku, GOOD speaker, good-to-greattrackpad, alarm clock, all in one place, what else do you need?  Well MAAAYYYBE activating that flash as a flashlight(software) and implementing a shake to hang up calls(software) or just connecting that damn button to kill the phone app (SIMPLE software).. but that's about it.  I originally bought this phone with plans of ditching it as soon as that Samsung Galaxy S Pro came out, but I can now say this inclination is far weaker that I ever could have anticipated.  And it will be further weakened when the 2.0 software hits.  Until I see some serious next-gen apps that punish this commendable hardware, I'm good.  The relative over-delivery has won my favor.I've discovered that in the browser the trackpad actually does become a mouse cursor while holding alt.  Awesome!!  And the shift does something too.

Its also my first Android phone. I bought it last November on ebay for $130.  I updated it to Android 2.1, then rooted it, then installed Titanium Backup.  Then I 'froze' 34 AT&T; pre-installed apps including Motoblur and the phone is so much faster.  I also downloaded APNoid to turn off 3G. I do not have a Data plan; I use WiFi instead.  Then I exported all of my Outlook and Facebook contacts to Gmail and the phone sync'd them all.  I also downloaded TaskKiller and CacheCleaner to clear the clutter after a lot of use to keep it speedy.  It is great as a phone and a PDA.  The battery lasts two days for me with occasional use.  The 2.1 Eclair update gave it Speech to Text, so I can send text messages without typing,(in a quiet environment).  It works very well.  But my favorite thing about it is the fact that when you flip the phone open, the camera switches sides.  Open it halfway, and you can hold it overhead and take pictures above the crowd and still see what you are getting.  Or hold it upside down and near the ground and take street level shots.  My friends would see images that I posted and ask if I laid down in the street just to take the picture. I also love the clock mode that stays on at night when its charging.  If you love sharing YouTube vids, open it in tabletop mode (like clock mode) and you can play YouTube videos to amuse everyone without holding the phone. This phone is great!  Its not for power users who want to play graphic-intense video games, but its great for the casual user.  I am going to buy another one to practice loading custom ROMs on.

The Backflip was the first Android phone offered for AT&T; customers and I jumped at it.  In hindsight, I should have waited until other options were available.  Here are my thoughts:- Battery:  Battery life is horrible.  For example, I left the house with 100% battery life and within an hour was at 77% without using the phone once.  I have the settings on power saver and have the phone shut down automatically to save battery life as well.  It's simply useless battery life.- Bluetooth:  This phone does not work well with my Bluetooth headset (which worked flawlessly with my Blackberry Bold).  It sometimes recognizes it and sometimes does not.  Which is frustrating when I make a call and discover I am not on the headset but have to use the handset.  This leads me to my third problem...- Handset:  This phone constantly cuts off phone calls.  There is a feature that is supposed to recognize with the phone is by your head (when on a call) and shuts the screen down so as not to hit \"end\" or \"mute\", etc.  However, this feature clearly does not work on my phone because it is constantly muting calls and ending them.- Slow:  The phone freezes often and I sometimes have to shut it down completely and \"reboot\".  The Internet is also extremely slow.- Bulky:  The phone is pretty large and heavy and bulky with the keyboard.  The keyboard isn't necessary and is actually difficult to use.On the positive side...- Features:  I love all the apps and features that the phone has.  It has a nice setup and is fun to use.Basically, the phone is decent but it has many bugs that need to be worked out.  The next generation Backflip will probably be far superior to this one.  As for me ... I will be getting a new Android phone a.s.a.p.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Does what I need of it", "Author": "J. Howell", "ReviewID": "RGX5P9SSAFCQL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I will say I am fairly new to the smart phone market, so my expectations were for some very basic features, such as: Touchscreen, a keyboard, decent internet, SD Card slot, SMS feeds, facebook, games, and apps. For the most part, it succeeds in those areas although the phone does have a few weaknesses here and there. I've had the phone for about a month now and have pretty much seen what works and what does not.THE GOOD- The Keyboard itself is fairly well designed and feels comfortable in the hand. I had no issues with input lag and such.- Phone is a decent compact size for a Android phone. Most are rather big at times, but this one fits in your pocket OK.- The internet is fairly decent and works fine with various sites that require you to log in.- Compatible with many of the Apps I have downloaded. All the major ones work just fine.- Has Wifi capabilities, so you can connect to a wireless network and not use up your data plan- The phone itself is fairly sturdy design wise and has survived several falls without any scuffs.- Can support up to 32GB for SD Cards. It itself comes with a 2GB SD Card which you may want to update when you get it.- It can charge when it is dead and has no problems with USB Charging on the PC when it is like that.- The battery itself is fairly decent. Depending on what setting you have it on, you can either use it up to 1-2 days on max settings with semi-heavy usage, and 5-7 days on standby on low power settings with a fair amount of usage. Recent updates have also helped cut down power consumption.- The youtube app works just fine and does a decent job of streaming the videos.THE BAD- You pretty much need to have Motoblur for updates. Also, if you do it wrong the first time, then you will need to do a factory reset and reconfigure your phone. Had to do this once so I could get updates.- The Phone is locked down and you can only put apps on via the Marketplace. This is more AT&T; then Motorola, and that might be lifted at some point with a update.- The search bar is currently for Yahoo only with no ability to change it over for Google. Once again this was a AT&T; decision and might change with the Android 2.1 update.- The actual phone part can be weird. Accessing a keypad during calls for computer operators can be annoying and trying to answer calls when the phone is off can be a bit hard due to you having to use the touch screen to pull over a tab to answer it. This can be a bit wonky and I am not sure if there is a way to turn it off.- Some of the Apps pre-installed from AT&T; or Motorla are semi-useless. Happenings fails to work most of the time and it is better to get a app for the social site you need (Like twitter or facebook). AT&T; Navigator is $9.99 a month and $2.99 for a day pass, so you will be forced to use that until Android 2.1 for GPS. Motoblur is very limited as far as options go and can be a bit glitchy to deal with.- While video recording is OK, The camera is very blurry and does not do well at all in a low light setting. Even with a flash, the images still come out blah. It is OK for stuff that you do not need a lot of quality on and out in the daylight, but it will not replace your digital camera.THE NEUTRAL- When you get the phone out of the box, the phone can be a bit slow at times. After I installed the Task Manager app and the two updates the phone had, the speed has increased quite a bit and isn't as clunky going to other screens and the internet is slightly faster.- Currently the phone is running Android 1.5 with Android 2.1 coming out in Q3 2010. What this means is you will be missing the free GPS capability, live wallpapers, Flash for websites, and such until then. However, even on 1.5 it still does fairly well and can download major apps off the store.- Because of the design of the keyboard when it is closed, it looks fairly ugly on the back. You also need to do this for pictures that are not self-portraits. The front looks fine though and kinda nice.- Game options are limited, but that is more the android market being very limited then the fault of the phone itself. Game speeds range from decent (2D games) to a little lag (3D games with not much happening) to very laggy (More recent 3D games meant for newer android phones). None of them are unplayable though, and the recent updates might help.- The Marketplace does not show what the game looks like and requires you to go online to see what it will be like.- The tracker on the back is fairly useless and does get in the way. For example, you might touch it while using a App or website and open something you might not want. For general navigation, it does OK if you do not feel like using the keyboard or touch screen, but you can not use it while it is closed (Which is stupid, since it is the only time where it may actually be useful)Ignoring the bad press it has gotten, the Backflip is the Black Sheep of the android market: it is one of the few AT&T; Android phones and the only one with a keyboard. Depending on what you want out of it, this might not be your phone. People who use their phones more for checking their email, going on facebook, seeing the weather or just need basic apps will get use out of it. More tech savvy people that may want to have a big screen for the internet/youtube and more speed will instantly scoff at it and say it sucks.It, however, does everything I need of it.

This phone seems to have enough processing power to keep it running without delay. I don't find the touchpad to be that useful, personally. I had some concerns about the keyboard, but it seems fine and rugged enough. it's not a traditional keyboard, it's all one piece, so it should hold up over time.

The alarm clock mode is very nice too.The negative? AT&T; loaded this phone up with crapware. Their maps application is useless due to Google Maps. Their radio application is spurious as well. The AT&T; IM and email applications are clunky.The universal inbox does not play that well with Gmail - some features are not available. Best to just use the Gmail app.Maybe the two biggest annoyances: AT&T; locked down the web search widget to Yahoo. You can't change it to Google. You also can't load applications that aren't from the android market.The MOTOBLUR front-end aggregates all your social networking site content into one place.

Meyer \"Redwulf\"", "ReviewID": "RQ2RW5BLVBG0W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was very proud when I received the first Android phone on the AT&T; network. It had everything I needed and quite a bit that I didn't. I actually looked forward to some of the bundled features though. Unfortunately, AT&T; took everything good about Android and effectively removed it from this phone.Although users do have access to the Android market, the phone is laden with AT&T; bloatware, which cannot be removed, uninstalled, or turned off. Even using a task-killer app provides only temporary relief. AT&T; turns its junk back on almost immediately.The expected customization for this phone could not happen. AT&T; locked it down and made it the most depressing Android device I have ever had the misfortune to use.PHONE CALL QUALITY: Average. Incoming calls are sometimes dropped before they can be answered. Answering calls is a bit of a pain, as there is no hardware button to do so. You have to swipe across the bottom of the phone to answer, and this usually takes two or three tries. Callers said my voice was sometimes hard to hear, especially with any background noise. I could usually hear callers fairly well.NETWORK: It's 3G, but AT&T; is notoriously unreliable, at least around here (MS Gulf Coast). I have never had max bars anywhere around here, and often lose my signal around town in various buildings. WiFi works fairly well, although it sometimes drops or cannot connect for no apparent reason, and the phone must be rebooted for it to work.CAMERA: It's ok. Nothing special, but fairly good quality for a phone. Decent flash LED.COMFORT: It's not terribly comfortable to use. It's a bit thick, and it's flip keyboard feels awkward in my hand. The rear touchpad is useless, and often causes me to accidentally move the cursor or screen focus. It would have been better as a slider, rather than a flip phone.QWERTY KEYBOARD: Is AWFUL! It is the worst slide-out keyboard I have ever encountered. The buttons are stiff and difficult to press. Typing is slow and painful as a result. A virtual keyboard would be much better, but the screen on the Backflip is too small for that.SOFTWARE: Bloated with far too much AT&T; crapware, which cannot be removed. Most of Android's attractive features have been neutered. Rooting the phone may make a difference, but it voids the warranty and should not be attempted by anyone other than experts. I downloaded apps to replace almost all of AT&T;'s worthless junk, from the text messaging software to the calendar.SERVICE: AT&T; is horrible. The plans are way overpriced, extremely complicated, and very easily manipulated. I frequently find odd services each month that I did not order or want. Anyone with AT&T; should pay careful attention to every phone bill to make certain you are not being charged for something you did not want.BOTTOM LINE: I learned a hard lesson. The phone is usable, but nothing special, and certainly not worth the price I paid. I intend to leave AT&T; as soon as my contract is up and switch to C-Spire (Cellular South) or Verizon. C-Spire's plans are wonderfully inexpensive, but Verizon has the best selection of phones to choose from.

With everyone talking about the Android operating system, I quickly settled on the Backflip as the only Android option on AT&T.; I quickly found a used one on eBay that I picked up for $65, and for that price, it was tough to beat.Once the phone was upgraded to Android 2.1 (early November, 2010) the number of apps that were available tripled. However, the phone still has a tiny amount of memory, and the 2.1 O/S and the useless Motoblur interface takes a larger share of it. Without much available memory, the phone slows to a crawl when switching applications, and some core applications (like Google Latitude!) will not work in the background at all.This is a great alternative to use for kids who are stuck on the AT&T; network who cannot afford the iPhone.

It is definitely packed with a lot of cool features and is therefore fun to use. I won't go into all of the details about the features since most of them are already listed so I will mainly focus on the problem areas.PROS: It is easier to update your status on Facebook then it is to do a search for a contact and call them or send them a message. If you would rather play around on FB and not call people then this is a major pro. Of course you can add speed dials but if you have a lot of contacts to search through then it can be annoying trying to find someone to call or text.- The camera is great. Even at 5MP the pictures look great. Plus you can edit pictures (such as contrast, add word balloon, bunny ears, etc.) and you can easily text them to people and of course upload them to FB.- The keypad is sealed and really comfortable to use. The backtrack is also cool when navigating the phone but I actually don't use it all that much. You can also disable it if you want.- The screen and graphics look really amazing. Everything on the internet looks great and it's fun to search the web. I downloaded the Wikipedia app so you don't have to open up the explorer to look up something on Wikipedia.- As mentioned, the homescreen is customizable. You can but icons where you want and change the clock, etc. I really like the layout and navigating it is fun.Now for the CONS:First of all, if you are really into emails and text messaging DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT buy this phone!!! Texting and emails are for the most part bad to good. If you send one or too texts here and there then you are fine. But I have had many times where I will reply to someone in a text and it gets sent to someone else. Also, if you and someone else are texting back and forth it sends the phone into memory overload. My wife and I have texted back and forth several times and basically, if you are typing while the other person is sending you a message then the phone freezes and your words don't even show up until the other message gets through. It's extremely frustrating.Emails are ok, but do not try to depend on it for work like with a Blackberry. Several times I have sent email from it that never got to the recipient. And it even showed that it had been sent. Also, most emails take at least 5 to 10 mins to even show up on the phone! For example, when facebook emailed me notifications, I wouldn't get the email until I actually went to FB on the browser and saw that there was a new notification. But of course I didn't get alerted to this until at least 5 mins. later.Also, the touchscreen can be very stubborn. At times it will move through everything no problem then I will touch something and it accidentally calls someone. Then I try to end the call and it just sits there calling away. Plus, there is the screen lock button I always press before I put it in my pocket. Many, many times I will lock it then pull it out of my pocket several minutes later and find that it had opened all kinds of apps or that it was typing a bunch of nonsense on my Facebook update.There are also calling issues. My wifes phone, and this lady I work with have had this issue several times where they will call someone but the other person can't hear them. They had to full power off the phone several times to get it to start working again. I also had an issue once where my wife was calling me and I kept sliding the bar to answer the phone but it never picked up the call!! My wife got mad at me for not answering the phone even though I tried several times. I finally had to do a full power off and it resolved the issue.I think several of these issues will be resolved if they ever release the 2.0 version of Android for this phone. As for the lagging performance, unfortunately I think that has a lot to do with the fact that the CPU is only 528Mhz. which is just pathetic.Overall, I still like the phone despite it's drawbacks. I would recommend it to friends unless they had an iPhone. I will keep this pig around until it starts to get to another layer of Hell then I will eventually get an iPhone.

The bluetooth connection works but does not have the same functionality as my previous phone (KRaZr). In other words, once I connect my Mac to the Backflip via bluetooth, I can't browse the phone or do anything else.There exists a third party patch for Apple's isync software for some newer phones (for an extra $15) but the Backflip is not supported at this time.

Read on... The hardware is great, the software is the WORST. Happily there's a way you can replace the slow, buggy, bloatWare that comes packaged from ATT/Moto.HARDWARE---------Motorola has always made good hardware. This is no exception. As compared to my primary iPhone 4 phone, this hardware works well.1. Good battery life. If you are running Blur and letting it update 1000 times a second your battery will suffer. That's true of any phone and any software that is constantly updating via the network.2. Good size / Weight3. Good screen. Maybe not as nice as the iPhone 4 Retina but it's nice and readable.4. GREAT speakers. This thing is like a mini Boom Box! Pandora is lounder on this than it is on my iPad!!!5. Keyboard. This is a plus in itself. It's small but it's there and it's probably as good or better than any touch-screen keyboard.SOFTWARE--------I am shocked that ATT/Moto ships this device with the software in this sorry state. It's slow, it crashes, Blur eats the battery. On top of that, there is a TON of BLOATware loaded on the phone. Crap from AT&T; that they try to trick you in to buying. Additionally it runs Android 1.5 which is an ANCIENT version. I had to hack (root and install custom ROM) the phone a bit to get Android 2.1 installed and I can tell you there is a WORLD of difference. The Marketplace on 1.5 is TERRIBLE... no screenshots for apps, it's hideous. It also \"feels\" very slow compared to 2.1. The Phone app crashed more than once on this brand new phone with the stock ATT/Moto Blur/Android 1.5 install.This is a new device shipping with very old software and loaded with bloatware to top it off. The user experience out of the box had me ready to take it back. the user experience on the Android 2.1 ROM (without ATT bloat or Blur enabled) has me thinking about putting my iPhone 4 on eBay! It's that good.--------I am an app developer coming from iPhone. I expect a lot. This little phone delivers on 2.1. For those who don't want to spend the time (medium difficulty) installing a new ROM, there is still hope. The rumor is that Moto/ATT will be updating to 2.1 so you can have it without hacking it on there. If ATT/Moto have any interest in customer satisfaction they will update it to 2.1 immediately. Why they haven't already (since it is a huge improvement) is a mystery to me.If you do want dig into the guts and put 2.1 on now, google around for \"backflip preclair\".

I almost wasn't going to get one based on some reviews here, but after reading one review that wasn't lasy--decided to take the plunge (backflip).  Mine arrived yesterday, and I must repeat that the negatives reviews on here are WRONG!  They were obviously written by teenagers or folks too lazy to take the time to setup the Backflip properly.  This phone has all of the features you'd need and more.  Battery life is superb!  Once I figurerd out how to apply just the settings and features I wanted, the phone was a joy to navigate.  I highly recommend this phone to anyone thinking of getting a smartphone.  Another plus over the IPhone, is the ability to change thae battery out if it dies.", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great hardware but needs android experience liberated", "Author": "Dragoslav Grbovic \"Drago\"", "ReviewID": "R10885A9OWC4ZR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wish I could give this device a 5 star rating as I love the hardware. I love the interface. However, I will most likely be returning this phone before 30 day trial period expires, unless there are clear guarantees of android 2.1 upgrade and allowing choice of search widgets, because I want a FULL android experience. I have been using at&t; for many years and I think that they do have the best network, but I don't want them crippling my phone. I speak as a former G1 user (used G1 on the at&t; network without full 3G). I was so anxious for at&t; to finally start offering an android phone and I am hoping they come to their senses. I am even co-sponsoring a facebook group for people to voice their cries for liberating the Backflip ([...])I agree with some other comments about the battery life, but I hope battery \"training\" will help some of that.Again, great hardware, good software but NOT AN ANDROID! I hope to be able to change this rating to 5 stars soon.I am just reporting that I have returned this phone last Sunday and will be happy to get it again if and when it upgrades to android 2.1 and allows the possibility to choose your search widget provider. I am not so worried about the non-market apps.The second update is that after the announcement that Motorola is upgrading to android 2.1 in Q3 2010 ([...]), I re-purchased the phone (this time through amazon). It came, this time with infinitely better battery life (the original one must have been faulty). I am enjoying the phone and hope to be able to bump my rating to 5 stars once I see the upgrade.The third update: After the 2.1 upgrade, this phone is even better (upgraded my review to 4 stars). Google search and navigation are one of the main improvements. Many more 2.x compatible apps are available. It does get laggy sometimes but I can live with that.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "awesome phone", "Author": "Michael Persky", "ReviewID": "R1IGZNSHK6X28V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is a phone for tech geeks like me who actually want to spend time and learn more about the phone and features, this isnt a phone for an average joe, its meant for like i said before, its a tech geeks phone, those who wrote negatives, battery life is ok, the only reason you have battery life probs is cause you keep checkin the phone all time, well stop lookin at it all the time and look at it less, i had an iphone and was do for an upgrade , was goin to upgrade to the bold 9700, then i saw the backflip and read reviews and info on it, then i upgraded to it, its a nice phone, my friend said android phones are goin to be the nxt step in phones, i agree its the future of phones, i love this phone, if you dont like it dont buy it", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Does not allow web installs and other restrictions ruin it!", "Author": "B.

Cannot install apps from the web because according to the \"level 4\" Motorola Support guy I talked to \"due to carrier restrictions.\" Do not buy this phone, as this severely limits what you can do with your phone. I tried to install Google's own scripting app and I can't due to this restriction.Also bad:Comes with several apps from AT&T; that you cannot uninstall including the useless AT&T; Navigator which requires an expensive monthly subscription, AT&T; Music and other junk apps from AT&T; taking up the limited space you have to install apps.Also uses Yahoo! search, something you can't change. They removed Google search from Google's own mobile operating system.Comes with the old Android 1.5 and says \"upgradable to 2.1\" but guess what: you have to wait for Motorola to upgrade you whenever they decide they'll upgrade all these phones. Until then you're stuck with this old version of Android.The brightness setting only changes the brightness for the screen and not the backlit buttons which are very bright - so if you are trying to limit brightness in a dark room, you can't, and it sucks up your battery.The screen is pretty small and most of the time this isn't so bad, but some apps you can hardly read the fonts because they are so small.Otherwise the keyboard is very nice. I like the hardware, the little touchpad on the back and how it flips but the software restrictions imposed by AT&T;  have ruined this phone and am returning it.Don't buy it. Get a Verizon Droid or a Nexus 1. Much better phones.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003A4HWYU"}}
