Vidaurri \"digitalmonkeys\"", "ReviewID": "R265BN30CSKU2A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had a flip phone for 5 years on Verizon. Wanted to pay less per month and get a better phone without spending a lot. Wanted the Nokia X2 but the salesperson talked me into the new Sparq.The call clarity is great. People on the other end though say that when I am not talking it sounds like I have hung up, there is complete silence.  From my end though there is no distortion, no humming or buzzing, it's very clear.  I have had only 1 dropped call in a week and that was in the basement.The front keypad is horrible.  The buttons are spongy rubber and you have to press down with your nail right in the middle of the button, thankfully though most of my calls are to my contacts.The phone is small and slippery, I have almost dropped it or dropped it on my lap numerous times.  The back of the phone is smooth plastic.The music sounds great from the phones speaker, much better than my girlfriends LG touchscreen. The music menus though are cumbersome and difficult to use.  There are fewer options than both our last LG's for sorting and listening to music.The camera takes poor quality pictures that blur easily and is useless in low lighting.The menu's are not intuitive or easy to use.  It's hard to find menu options you are looking for.There is no volume button anywhere to be found, you have to go into the \"profiles\" section to set your ringer volumes and then switch between these \"profiles.\"  You cannot manually turn the ringer up or down otherwise.Internet is about worthless.  Trying to look up anything takes FOREVER, I mean slower than dial-up, don't know what dial-up is, ask your folks.  Every page is a \"loader.\"  I even got a \"memory full\" error message when trying to load a google page.  I was able to find a business phone number on google but it took about 5 minutes, calling information would have been easier and worth the $2. If you are going to use this phone for web, even once a month get a different phone.  I do check email often on it though, it's easy to read emails, difficult to respond, delete, or sort.Texting is okay if you turn off the smart text. That's when it autofills in a word it thinks you are trying to type. It's awful and accidentally fills in words you didn't choose.  My girlfriend has this feature on her LG touchscreen and it works well. The slider is okay but feels cheap and flimsy. I have small hands and small fingers for a 6' tall guy and it's still harder to txt on the slider than my old flip phone.  I thought I'd love the qwerty keyboard, I don't. The function button that you have to use all the time is hard to hit, and doesn't always respond. The keys almost need to be pounded and not touched to work right.Battery life seems good, got about 100 texts, hours of talking, even some frustrating web usage and the battery needs only to be charged every other day.  I did turn down the brightness on the screen, all the way up it's like a lighthouse beacon at night.  I also changed the duration that the screen stays lit after you stop hitting keys. It's preset for 30 sec and I think I changed it to 10sec. That saves a lot of battery life when your phone is just sitting.Ringtones were surprisingly easy to change. My LG, still haven't figured out how to do it without paying verizon. This phone, I just loaded my music, went to profiles and selected a song from my library. You can do the same with each contact, they can all have different ring tones.There is definately a learning curve for this phone. My LG flip phone and my girlfriends LG touchscreen are both intuitive and easy to operate.  Finding and changing settings on both our LGs was a snap and its fast and easy to navigate the menus. This phone is anything but easy. I will be returning this phone and trying the Nokia x2 or the Lg Optimus.  I would not recommend this phone to anyone who plans to text a lot or use the web. It's a basic generic phone with extremely basic features.UPDATE: I decided to keep this phone as T-mobile was no longer carrying the phone I had wanted.  The phone speaker stopped working about 2 weeks after I bought it and had to be swapped out.  T-mobile rep at the store said they usual make you mail them in and you are without a phone for weeks, but since it had only been 2 weeks she swapped it in the store for me.  Bonus points for customer service!UPDATE: Had this phone for about 7 months now and the speaker no longer turns off when I insert headphones.  this makes it almost useless as an MP3 player.  If I hook it up to my home stereo the music continues to blare from the phones speaker and kill the battery, if I plug it into my car aux jack, same thing, very annoying.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good phone for the money", "Author": "Tony Apf", "ReviewID": "R2D9HKB5NS0VUV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking for a replacement phone for my Nokia for my Tmobile prepaid, since a decent Nokia phone that isnt a droid is difficult to find at Tmobile these days I chose the sparq by Alcatel. the phone is pretty close to my Nokia as far as accessories and ease of use. My only complaint is that when I end a phone call and press the end button for more than a second, the phone will power of. I have to adjust for that and give the button a quick push, and not hold it too long. Otherwise, the phone is simple to use, easy to follow instructions and does what it should.

Definitely recommend this particular seller. The phone came in the exact same condition as it was originally manufactured and packaged in. The best part was that, due to being an Amazon Student member (one-time only offer which entitles you to a 50% discount on the Amazon Prime membership - $39 for the year of free 2-day shipping instead of $78-9 default), I paid no sales tax OR S&H; (shipping and handling) fees. Could have gotten it from Wal-Mart a few miles down the road but why spend money on gasoline to pick it up (whether I bought it online and had it shipped to the store or not), pay sales tax if I bought it from the store's inventory AND/OR pay S&H; if I sent it to my home address - especially when I don't have immediate need for it? Waiting a couple of days was more than acceptable for the overall price discount.The phone is well designed for compact portability. In regards to its general specs: The phone keypad is spongy and durable, but small and tight-knit(typos will not be few and far between, regrettably for those with grown-up fingers); the speaker is fairly clear; the digital camera is well made but not professional level in definition; and the text message keypad - while having fairly small buttons - makes up for its lack in physical size with sufficient spacing between each key to avoid repeat typos due to an overcrowded/cluttered console. Odd how the two keypads simulate and oppose each other in design. Another point of note is that the menu items are pretty much individually ordered in a standard grid formation. Size-wise, anyone familiar with the Nokia 1661 (pre-paid colors were gray with red lining along the seams), which I am actually replacing with this one, would recognize this model as the technical big brother of sorts - in physical build, with added flexibility and size. An upside to the scale of it is the ease that one can manipulate its sliding mechanism one-handed - \"easy open, easy close\" with just your thumb doing the work. Protective skins for this model (frequently referred to by its battery brand name, Alcatel) can be found in abundance on Amazon, eBay and Google Shopping (for general listings of availability). More often than not, the S&H; will cost you more than the skin(s) itself/themselves.These points are worth considering, ESPECIALLY when compared to the level of personal need for the merchandise in question. This was just a replacement/DIY (do-it-yourself) upgrade of sorts. Just a specialized messaging type, slide design model cell phone to make texting more time and energy efficient in the long run. (Note: If anyone didn't realize yet, should you be on a standard 2-year agreement, you can buy a prepaid cell phone model to use with your phone plan sim card WITHOUT needing to re-negotiate your payment plan or phone contract with the service provider. Just switch the sim card out of 1 phone and put it in another while keeping the original as back-up. This extra advice is particularly for those who are still unfamiliar with technology's standard tips and tricks.)", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "This phone stinks!", "Author": "Roserin98", "ReviewID": "R2I0C6BB5G6S66", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "From the day I got this phone it has been having glitches. When I am in the messaging area it will go to a black screen and not let me do anything in that area for five minutes or more. Sometimes it will even turn itself off when that happens. The I have to turn it back on. We called the number and they said there was no new phones. I would eather get a refurbished or a used phone. They had no new phones because they were too \"new\". Thats a lie because I have seen this phone in store for a long time. Now even when I have singal it wont let me talk. I will move around and it still says I have signal I still cant text or call people. This phone maker dosnt know their own phone, and the phone would be better used as a weight lift.Update: July 5, 2013:So I thought maybe just maybe the phone would get better. No it got worst. At this point I can not go a day without it turning itself off, going to the black screen, going to an emergency mode where I can not access messaging, and not telling me who called. Now it would be better if only one of these happened. No all of them happen with the exception of the calling one everyday. Yestarday alone it turned itself off four times, went to black screen four, and did the emergency thing too many too count. I have now noticed though that half the time it goes to the black screen it goes to the emergency mode. Now even with all these issues it barely works for what I wa.Ted a phone for. Texting. Half the time I press buttons and they do not register. With the space button I ha e to press it about on average four times to get a single space. It also does not keep up well if you text at a steady pace whip ch I do. It gets to the point where if I am not looking I am sentences ahead and by the time it catches up half the letters are gone and jumbled up and I have to redoubt it all. I wish I could get a new phone but unfortunately I can not so this will ha e to do unroll then.

Most of my complaints are actually the way it is programmed.  In order of how often it drives me crazy:* Call me old fashioned, but I like to capitalize things that should be capitalized while texting.  This phone makes that an arduous task.  There isn't a \"shift\" key, but a key that changes between three modes, ABC, Abc and abc.  So if you want to use \"I\" in a sentence, you have to change mode to all caps and then back out.  The same thing goes for the first letter in someone's name.  And if you use a punctuation, it automatically goes back to abc mode on you.* If you get a text, it pops up with that notification.  But if you click on that notification, it clears it . . . and goes to your regular screen.  You want to see the text, you have to go over and click on texts, go down to the first one, open that up, etc, just like normal.*Also, if you are looking at the text and put it in your pocket, it will NEVER lock itself.  It locks automatically from the main screen, but if you have something open, all bets are off.  And if you put it in your pocket, it will most likely call the person who texted you.  This has happened more than once.*I like to have specific ringtones and pictures for the people who call me the most.  I bought a microSD card and loaded it up.  But if you remember something you want to add later and take the card out to add it, the phone erases everything you just set up.  So if you set up the ringtone and picture for six friends but want to add a seventh, you have to reassign the first six all over again when you pop out the card.*Speaking of which, when I assigned people in the first place, it took me days to figure out why one person wouldn't work right.  It turns out that if the name is longer than will fit on the small screen, it can't figure out who you are talking about.  Once I made a short nickname, it had no problem.*And finally, when I assigned my speed dial numbers (which took some hunting online for instructions), it assigned that key to a person, not the specific number I picked.  I wanted to call my mom's home line when I pressed the 2 button, but it calls the first number in her contact list . . .the cell phone.  The only way around that is to make a separate fake contact with only the home line listed.I'm a very low-maintenance person on my phone.  In fact, when I first got this phone I was thrilled because it was my first keyboard phone.  But at this point, it is driving me crazy.  I'm sticking with it because I am too cheap and lazy to switch phones again, but I'll probably cave at some point.  I think the reason it drives me crazy is because these all seem like such simple to fix, stupid problems.", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "My daughter LOVES this phone, she's 12, it's just right for her!

I love how I can go three, four days without charging it :) The keyboard? It's... slightly annoying. I've had this phone for about a month and a half now and I've realized that I've gotten used to the qwerty keyboard; I haven't had as many problems typing out words without messing up lately. The front keyboard is the one I really can't stand. The keys are really soft and I have to dig my nail in it which is really annoying.Also, I don't know if it's just me, but when I'm texting and I press the button that shows you more characters, sometimes I accidentally push the 'back' button which is right next to it. And this phone doesn't save texts automatically so I'd have to start all over.Now, the volume. It's really irritating that this phone doesn't have a simple volume control button on the side. I mean, that's a basic feature for every phone. Even my old green-screen Nokia bar phone had one. I've been all through this phone but I can't seem to find a way to increase the volume so I just gave up. If I'm in a loud place, I can't hear this phone unless it's on vibrate.Vibrate, by the way, is really strong; I want a good vibrate because with previous phones, it'll be in my pocket and I won't even feel it or it'll be on a table and I won't hear it if I'm in a loud area. So the fact that the vibrate is so strong that it actually startles me is a plus.As for call quality, it's pretty decent. I'm pretty satisfied with T-Mobile's service. I don't think I've experienced any dropped calls except for that time I was out in the middle of nowhere in the country, but that's expected. I can hear people crystal clear, and they can hear me just the same.Oh and the camera sucks. I had the Samsung Galaxy from AT&T; but I canceled it because the bill was ridiculous but that was one good camera. And this one? Poor quality and blurs easily. I'm not just saying this because I got used to the Galaxy's cam, even my other non-amazing camera phones had better quality than this. So I don't even bother with this phone's camera.All in all, the battery life and call quality is good, the keyboard is okay, the camera sucks, and navigating my way around this phone sucks. I'm surprised I managed to easily add a ringtone from my computer.The battery life and call quality are the only things keeping me from chucking this phone across the room and buying a new one.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Small and functional", "Author": "C.H.", "ReviewID": "R1YAQ7A6Q6EX69", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm not a smartphone person. Been there and done that a few times. They're more than I need and want, so back to the basics for me. I've only had this phone for about a month, but so far I am pleased with its capabilities. Calls are clear, checking Facebook/emails is fine using the Opera Mini browser that's pre-installed, and texting is easy for me (I have skinny fingers, but I can see how a person with thicker fingers might have some difficulty with the small keyboard). For a basic phone, it does its job well and fulfills my needs. However, if you're a smartphone user and prefer that kind of technology, then this phone will be a significant downgrade for you.What I would like for this phone to have is a time display on the screen after the screen times out; however, the screen goes completely dark when it times out, so you have to push a button and totally illuminate the screen to check the time (I know...get a watch, right?). I can forgive this shortcoming, though, since the phone is so affordable. If it breaks, I'll probably buy another one. It's so cheap...why not? Heck, I may even go ahead and buy another one in case something happens. It's smaller than some other slide-out QWERTY phones (like the Samsung Gravity), and I prefer small phones over large phones any day. So far, I've had a good experience with this phone--no technical issues as of yet.Edit: Well, today is July 18th, 2013, and I had to replace the phone yesterday because it just stopped texting and making calls altogether. I'm not sure what went wrong with it. I could still access the internet, but texting and calling became impossible. I tried everything I knew to do (restart, remove battery, remove sim card, etc.), but to no avail. It was a good phone up until that point.

I like the fact you can enter text messages in either horizontal (landscape) with the slider out, or verticle (portrait) with the slider in, and flip between while composing the same message... that's pretty cool.Another big plus is the ability to program commands to six keys on the front - the four navigation key positions and the two softkeys. I agree with others who've complained about the menu system, and lack thereof. It is cumbersome, but this programmability can ease some of that pain. I can get to the main menu, camera, messages, contacts, profiles (these are phone command setups, i.e., mute the phone) and settings with one button push. These are the menu's I use most often.OR... you can have a Widget bar that is also a quick way to get to certain points in the menu system. 5 keys, only three programmable tho.The keys are small as this is a small phone.

Comerford \"Ryk\"", "ReviewID": "R24WK9V3ZOT3LP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got the T-Mobile Sparq on Friday 05/10/13, and it has been a nightmare. The first problem was getting the Bluetooth to play music correctly,even though my headphones were paired, the music wasn't going to the headphones. A salesman changed a setting that got that to work, but if the phonewas turned off, the setting for the music changed back and music came out of the speaker.The music player has no option for creating playlists, so if you want to do that you're out of luck.The specs I was looking for was stereo Bluetooth and being able to use a 16 GB memory card,which it can do, but the music player sucks and the Bluetooth is difficult. All I had to do on my AT&T; Pantech Breeze 2 was connect the headphones to the phone, and that was it, no special settings to get the music to go to the headphones. After the music issue, tried web browsing, which was a total disaster. T-Mobile has \"unlimited\" Internet, and with a Qwerty slider keyboard you would think it would be good for using Twitter or being online. It was incredibly slow, and kept getting \"memory full\" error messages. I discovered the Sparq has so little RAM, a spec I didn't think to look up, it's almost useless for using online.When I checked my phone's RAM I had 1.9 MB to work with, which filled up fast.A description online said the phone has 8 MB of RAM, either way, my old flip Pantech Breeze 2 has 80 MB of RAM, which was good enough to surf the Web with. So the phone is worthless to me as a music player and for being online, all this phone is good for is phone calls and voicemail, that's it. So I found out you can \"unlock\" your old cell, and put your T-Mobile SIM card in your old phone, and use it instead. Which is what I did. Back to the Pantech Breeze 2, with a T-Mobile SIM card in it. But T-Mobile tech support doesn't really know how to change the settings on the phone so the Internet will work. So no Internet, but the Sparq was useless anyway. After 3 days of using T-Mobile, AT&T; is looking a lot better.

I'm not sure I understand what the person is talking about when they said in their review that this phone is slippery.  I haven't had any problems in that regard.  Maybe I will understand with time, and if so, I will come back and say more.

If you miss that one notification, and you don't look at your phone, you will not know that you have a message.

I am not a fan.On the upside, it has an FM radio in it, plus a halfway decent mp3 player that you can use if you plug a microSD card into it. So it's not altogether a bad little phone.

The radio is a nice substitute for pandora but only works when a headset is plugged in.  It has a lot of features comparable to a smart phone but just not as advanced.

The buttons are spongey and horrible and hard to use, the graphics are horrible. If you open the keyboard at times, it completely shuts down your phone. The texts do not come in order, instead are all mixed and jumbled up. The camera is barely better than the human memory of a 200 year old man with Alzheimers ....

We've had T-Mobile for over 10 years so this was a cheap way to add her on to our existing plan.
