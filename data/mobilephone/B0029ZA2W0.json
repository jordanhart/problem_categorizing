{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very impressive phone with many features", "Author": "D. Truong \"El Duke\"", "ReviewID": "R3C2US72MJQTUT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using my new Blackberry 8220 flip phone for about a week now. Here are my impressions about this phone... the pros and cons.  Keep in mind that this is my first Blackberry phone, so I do not review it in comparison to any other blackberry. Instead, I compare it to other flip phones I've had. My last flip phone was the Motorola KRZR K1. This phone eats it up, and spits it out.Pros:-Call quality: sound quality while making and receiving calls are good. There doesn't seem to be a difference in quality between making a wifi call or network phone call (see wifi)- Wifi: This phone has a built in wifi receiver. This means that if you have a wifi connection at home (or any unsecured wifi signal) you can browse the web with this phone (for free). The pre-installed t-mobile browser is lame (it doesn't let you browse any website you want unless you sign up for the data plan). Download the free browser \"Opera\" for this phone, and you can cruise any website you want.-Wifi calling: When you are connected to a strong wifi signal... you can make calls over the wifi connection, thereby not using up your minutes on your plan... very cool!-web browsing: Web browsing is as good as it gets on a 240 x 320 resolution screen. Again, I recommend downloading a free copy of the Opera browser. When used with a fast wifi connection, loading time for pages is surprisingly fast.-Built in mp3 player: The mp3 player works well and sounds good, but the layout/interface could be better. (tip: use button #4,#6 to skip songs instead of using trackball) For example, when the phone is closed... you can only access volume controls. The built in standard 3.5mm headphone jack is fantastic, though! All phones should have this... I absolutely love not having to carry around an annoying adapter just to listen to my music in the car or over headphones. It's also cool that it has the ability to display album artwork :) This phone comes with a handsfree headset/stereo headphone... very cool! The included headphones sound surprisingly good too... about as good as a typical $30 set of Sony headphones.-Screen: The screen is small but gorgeous... colors look saturated and images look very sharp.-Camera: For a 2 megapixel camera... it works well and does a good job of automatically adjusting shutter and exposure. Color saturation and contrast could be better, though. Even on the highest resolution... images lack high contrast and sharpness. Built in flash is a nice extra.-mp3 ringers - I really love the fact that you can use any mp3/sound file as a ring-tone, alarm tone, alert tone... etc.-Texting: At first, I really hated the button configuration for texting. It's totally different from most phones. But once you get used to it, texting on this phone works very well and the intelligent word suggestions are pretty good at guessing what word you're typing. The ability to add your own words to the custom library is great, too. I love that when a text messagecomes, you can preview the first few lines of the on the front screen... very useful! Also, there are special status lights on the front of the phone that blinks Red on the front of the phone when you have an unread text.-Picture texting: Photo texting seems to work relatively well, but the only limitation is that you can only add a few words of text along with the image. I'm not sure if this is a limitation of the 'mms message system' or phone.-expandable mini-SD/mini-SDHC. This is awesome for storing tons of images and music for the mp3 player... very cool! Right now, you can expand it up to a 16GB micro SDHC card and essentially have a 16gb Mp3 player in addition to a phone.Cons:-Battery Life: Sadly, the battery does not seem to last very long... even when the phone is only used for texting.  For example, I noticed that the battery drained down to about 40% capacity from just one day of texting (no phone calls). To be fair, I do text a lot in one day (perhaps 50 a day?) Sadly it's a phone you'll probably have to charge every day even if you don't use it very often throughout the course of your day. If you're listening Blackberry, please release a Hi-capacity battery for this phone!-Non-standard USB connector:  I don't like that it has a non-standard usb connection. If you loose the cable, you'll have to get one especially made for the blackberry. They could have easily made it the standard min-usb to USB connection (but they didn't... GRrr!) Oh well, at least they got the standard 3.5mm headphone jack right.- The whole phone is very prone to fingerprint smudging... so it ends up looking oily and kinda gross, if not cleaned like... everyday.Conclusion:  The positive features greatly outweigh the few negative things about this phone. This phone has an impressive array of features... considering how small the device is. It's really a tiny computer in addition to a phone, and it does most things pretty darn well. If you're into flip phones, and want one that does more than probably any other one out there...then this one may be the phone for you. I just wish that the battery on this baby lasted longer! Oh well, even tiny computers take lots of juice I guess :)Fun tip: You can get the game Pac-man for this phone for free online :)", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Blackberry - Different Look.", "Author": "Joseph Jespersen", "ReviewID": "R2LZZKNM7LSYLA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Blackberry Pearl Flip is an excellent Blackberry option for those of us who need our corporate or web email but don't want to lug something around attached to the belt.  The appearance and design is exceptional and the functionality is equally excellent as expected from all Blackberry devices.The Good:- Small, compact design, full Blackberry functionality in your pocket.- Excellent design (look).- Large keys.- Decent camera.- Blackberry's latest OS.- WiFi.The Bad:- Small screen.- Non-customizable outer LCD screen.The Ugly:- Nothing.For the sake of infomation, this is my second Blackberry owned.  Previously, I have used the Blackberry Curve 8300 series for over a year.  Prior to that, I was on the Motorola Q for several months as well.  While my Peal Flip is company issued, I don't look like a corporate soldier when I'm away from the office.  If you're going for the \"I'm an executive\" public image, then don't purchase/choose the Pearl Flip.  If you're looking for Blackberry's functionality in a discrete pocketable phone, the Blackberry Pearl Flip is an excellent choice.*** I also purchased the OEM Blackberry Leather Pocket case for the phone.  Excellent choice for the phone, keeps the profile thin and looks fantastic.

I'd never had a blackberry before, and've always been intrigued by them. I'd heard good things about this phone, and on \"paper\" it's a great phone for the price: wifi, gps, qwerty keyboard, flip phone, and quadband GSM.However, I've learned the hardway that my iPhone data plan is not really compatible with this T-Mobile phone:1) the data settings are already hardcoded to T-mobile, so changing them has been an unsurmountable challenge for me2) Wifi browser is also hardcoded to only work with T-Mobile Hotspots, although I heard you can download a separate browser that will work with all wifiThings I like- LED indicator for new text messages, missed calls. (I really wish more phones would have this feature)- Talk-time battery life, can easily go 4-6 hours of talk time+3 days of standby without any issue- a typing game on the phone, cheesy, but fun- standard 2.5mm headset connector (and it comes with the phone!)- USB chargingOther things I don't like- the camera. it's a tease. there is a flash and digital zoom, but the picture quality still sucks- the clamshell joint seems to be a little loose- the external LCD screen is made of a soft plastic, great for getting scratchedBottom line: If you are a T-Mobile BB subscriber, then this phone should be fantastic as a secondary or \"evening\" phone (you laugh, but if you're shopping for this on amazon then I'm probably not too far off target). For other GSM users, this is still a solid offering for a smartphone but maybe something like a Windows Mobile phone might work better for you.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Rim did a good job with the new calmshell", "Author": "Wires \"Jordan\"", "ReviewID": "R3GUQO8XYU5SQS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is sold from T-mobile here in the USA and comes in red and black, the phone is very light, the phone includes everything you know and love from blackberries including wifi, pin messaging, web, email and other pda-like functions.

It has so much less capacity than other models that it barely even functions as a telephone.The device is frequently frozen for up to 30 seconds as it runs background programs and \"thinks,\" to the point where I'm terrified of ever trying to use it in an emergency. It takes up to 10 seconds to recognize that I've started (and finished!) dialing a phone number before it registers the keytones. And often it doesn't acknowledge the first digit, but instead treats that digit as if it were just a button I pushed to wake up the phone, so I spend an enormous amount of time cancelling calls and trying to dial again correctly. Sometimes, mysteriously, the phone actually connects the call before the keytones kick in...Web browsing is no better. The browser constantly crashes, and the only way the crash can be cleared is by breaking out the battery. Restarting the device after replacing said battery takes forever. In one final annoying feature, there's no way to silence or turn down the volume on the \"dialing now\" keytones, so the phone sings like an old fax machine. I've spent hours on the phone with my provider to troubleshoot, and ultimately I've replaced it -- and the new 8220 has all the same problems.In short, it's a godawful piece of junk.

At first, I loved it. I would have given it 4 stars. I mean, it shut off every once and a while. Well, exactly 6 months later, it went into a constant reboot cycle. When I tried fixing it with software updates and memory wipes, it just up and died. Wouldn't turn on, wouldn't even give me a reboot cycle anymore. I took it to the T-mobile place. Replaced it right then and there. As I was leaving the college-town I got it from (Auburn, War Eagle!), it rebooted on me. Okay, well I figured it was a new phone and it was just updating or something. No, in fact, as time went on it became more frequent. And by the time it had become just a flat out inconvenience, RIM changed their replacement policy. I could no longer take it into the T-mobile store and replace it. What a bummer! He gave me a number to call and try and work something out. I decided to wait a few weeks and see what happened just in case the new battery I had bought on Amazon would fix it. Nope, it sure didn't. The phone still wasn't fixed. So I took it back to see what one last person could try and do to help me. He said to clear the cookies, the messages, and the, as he called it, \"crap log\", which I'm assuming is just a log of every process the phone performs. I did that and it stayed good for an hour. Then it rebooted yet again. And, to my luck, the store closed within that hour.... WTF... So I'm still stuck with my piece of doo doo phone. Please don't make the same mistake I did. Don't get this phone. It's a waste of money. And if you already have it, I recommend you get it replaced. Its not worth the time or effort to fix the thing. I just want a phone that works.

Gerber", "ReviewID": "R2XEV5DAB4MR5Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The 8220 was a poorly tested product.  Pretty little device designed to do much more than it was equipped to handle. Fundamental issues with WiFi performance, bluetooth, and simple instability with respect to its delicate nature.  The phone often needs to be restarted...battery issues?......SIM card easily dislodged?.....all these things.  This is one phone that you don't want to drop. Also, T-Mobile and BB rarely seem able to solve issues with this device, beyond the 2 most extreme measures of 1)  reinstall the OS or 2) replace the phone.  In my book, that's a lemon.  Please remember, this is a computer....not just a cell phone.  Could you imagine buying a desktop computer and discovering that the errors you've been having are typically fixed by having to wipe and reinstall the OS, or simply replacing the unit?  This would be considered HIGHLY unacceptable performance for a computer and should be similarly unacceptable for this smartphone.Don't buy this phone. Don't do it. The technology is not ready and T-Mobile provides horrible support for the phone's many weaknesses.Main problems:1) Too fragile. SIM card becomes dislodged or requires resetting quite often.2) WiFi - connectivity under the WiFi environment is sporadic. Do NOT rely on WiFi connectivity for phone calls. Your calls will be dropped. End of discussion. I have used this phone, with WiFi, at my 2 residences. Both are in moderate to major population areas and with \"excellent\" signal strength. The WiFi was the reason we bought these phones and have subsequently killed the service (T-Mobile charges you extra for this poorly delivered option).3) Dropped calls. Dropped calls. Within the cities of Chicago and Albuiquerque.4) Bluetooth malfunction. Check the forums. Bluetooth fails inexplicably and will not re-enable. T-Mobile offers only to replace phone with same model.5) T-Mobile's effective support on this phone is to either a) have you spend hours and hours wiping the phone and reinstalling the software, applications and entering your various user data. REMEMBER...this is a smart phone. Like a computer, you will spend a good bit of time setting the thing up, that is, if you use it for more just a phone. T-Mobile's other support effort is to b) have Blackberry replace the phone.....similarly requiring gobs of your time to troubleshoot, coordinate and then set-up the replacement device.6) Internet e-mail. My wife's phone inexplicably lost the ability to access her online e-mail. T-Mobile's suggested solution.....wipe the phone and start over. If that doesn't work (many of YOUR hours later) they'll get Blackberry to replace the phone.7) Battery life is VERY short.8) Browsing the phone's features is very slow. The phone reacts sluggishly to your inputs....including just dialing phone numbers. I am endlessly having to go BACK on command entry because the lag in response time caused me to sleect the wrong entry item.9) Browser speed is slow. I mean slow to unusable. I tend to run online searches for places and things using the Google Maps application. That may sound silly, however, it's much faster than using the basic browser function on this phone.10) In a nutshell, Blackberry is beta-testing this underpowered, previously untested smartphone and we are the guinea pigs. Nice idea packinking the PDA into this attractive little phone, however, they're not there yet. T-Mobile simply diverts all responsibility for the poor performance of the device to Blackberry.....and you.11) Don't buy it.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Useless piece of junk", "Author": "Rahul", "ReviewID": "R3D1KI0AL4Q1J9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have being using this phone for a year and half now.

When I received this item questions starting popping as what I saw and didn't see inside the box raised concerns. First off I didn't receive the 256mb memory card after searching in the box many times. The condition of the also made me wonder where the hell this seller official sourced this model phone from. The mobile phone had small dents and slight scratches to the back of the phone so it definately did not look like a brand new phone to me at all. Also the battery was not an original Blackberry battery but a generic OEM made in China type battery.I contacted the seller immediately in which they totally brushed me off and told me I will have to take my concerns directly with Blackberry. After contacting Blackberry and receiving a lot of automated messages from them my problems still had not been resolved. I decided to cut my looses as I am from Trinidad and to return this product would cost much more that the cost price of the mobile phone. After using this phone for sometime now the bluetooth offically no longer works and the battery life worst than ever. Before I was able to get at least a day and a half with a couple of texting and calls, has now boiled down to less than a day with only texting only.

I thought she'd like it for the one button calling and ease of use, but she found it wasn't easy in the ways that she needed.  I saw this and thought at the least it's attractive.  I was concerned about the scroll, but it really works well for her as she doesn't have to use any effort to push anything.  As she has paralysis in one arm, it's great that she can easily access the address book with one hand.  So far she likes it.  She only calls (quite frequently); no texting or email.  Calls are clear and so far no dropping.  The keypad has a really small font, but she rarely dials; primarily address book calling.  If I was only going by her use, I'd give it 4 stars.  However, I'm the one who set it up.  It's less than intuitive.  I had to go online a few times to do basic things like change the country code.  I still haven't been able to set up wifi (this may be because we have att and the phone is tmobile). She doesn't use the browser anyway, but I thought a nice to have as the phone has the capability.  So, if you want to pay a lot of money for a pretty flip phone in order to just make some calls, then I recommend it.

The phone is like any other standard Blackberry phone. HOWEVER, That is the ONLY thing that was missing....WIFI !!!! It shows in the connection management and you can activate it but i literally had to stand INFRONT of my router just so it'd connect, Just to cut to the point, Wifi doesn't really work on this phone.

Mines had no software/hardware issues (no rebooting, no Bluetooth issues, no slowdowns, etc).The advantages in general of the blackberry's are the great screen (geared for text readers) and the keyboard.The bad is the Blackberry \"WiFi situation\": they want you to buy the \"blackberry internet plan\" which is a hookup with your cell phone provider. Cell phone providers will have different names for this plan but note that it will cost you in the US around $15-$20. If you have a prepaid plan they will tell you the plan is not available (unless you have a monthly plan). I don't recommend this plan (if you can get it) because I consider it a ripoff. That will probably be the biggest issue with this phone (and all blackberry's).The workaround: If you want to use Wi-Fi they will use a combination of WiFi and GPRS/EDGE. For example when you try to use the BlackBerry GMail app from Google you will be able to install it halfway but when it tries to connect it will tell you, you need a connection. If you disable your data connection (GPRS/EDGE) you will get the same result and so on and so forth with different applications.To get around this BlackBerry Wi-Fi situation you have to get applications that are not exactly BlueBerry approved (and you will probably not see in their new store) that allow you to use Wi-Fi ONLY and not a combination Wi-Fi/GRPS/EDGE (again they use EDGE/GPRS to check if you have the BlackBerry Plan if you don't they don't give you access). For example for GMail I use LogicMail (uses Wi-Fi only), UberTwitter, Opera Mini, Yahoo Mail (you have to use their website) with the Opera Mini browser because you won't be able to use it with the BlackBerry browser (these are the only ones I found that I installed).Final review: Great phone, almost perfect form factor and screen (recommended 7 point font), almost perfect for SMS/MMS/emailing. Wi-Fi, Keyboard is better than a standard number keyboard but NOT better than a full keyboard (of course).

She really wanted a flip phone, because she likes the feeling of talking on flip phones better than talking into a brick.  She also doesn't want everyone to know she has a blackberry, and most people assume this is just a regular phone.  The hindge works great and hasn't been a problem.  The outside screen will get very scratched up from being thrown around in a purse or bag.  I highly recommend a stick on screen cover for the outside.Two problems - both known by Blackberry and experienced by many others.1) The track ball gets stuck.  not a big deal.  Just push down on it and roll it around.  It has always come back to life.  This is a known problem and the reason new Blackberries use a touch pad instead of a moving ball.2) The bluetooth dies.  This is a known hardware problem and has effected my wife's 8220 twice.  What happens is that - one day, out of the blue - you will be unable to \"enable\" the bluetooth radio.  It just stays greyed out.  Internet forums are filled with people who have this problem and the only solution is replacing the device. It is not software related and has nothing to do with the bluetooth device you are connecting to - it is the blackberry's bluetooth radio itself.  The bluetooth radio in the 8220 has a very limited lifecycle.If bluetooth is important to you, I would strongly suggest staying away from this.

Blackberry's are great anyway but for the simple fact this one is a flip version makes it even better.  It comes with different power adapters, so no matter where you are in the world, you can plug in.  I just happen to be deployed to Baghdad, Iraq and wow!  what a surprise to be able to plug the phone in directly to the wall.  It takes a little bit to get used to the way the keys are layed out for texting but once you get that down, it's just as easy as any other phone.  The one and only downfall I have is, never having owned a Blackberry, I was depending on the instruction guide to be a useful tool...Unfortunately, I do not read German and that is how the guide is printed.  So, a suggestion to the seller, make sure you put a manual in there that is written in english as well.  Other than that, great world phone!
