{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "David E Farris", "ReviewID": "R8XL4ZK5G37F0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my mom who is in a nursing home, she has never had a smartphone before. I wanted something that would be a great source of entertainment, and functional. It has lived up to my expectations! It was delivered very fast, and the price for what you get is amazing.  I purchased a samsung phablet for myself and payed twice as much. The touch screen is very responsive,no lag in apps. The sound that comes from the speaker is really really loud. Which is great for someone that is hard of hearing. I signed her Up for Walmart family mobile plan popped in the sim card and it was up and running. Phone calls are very clear no echo. It came with two battery's and a screen protector that was already installed. Also came with a case that doubles as a back for the phone. Not the most deluxe but serves it's purpose. Hoping to find a trident type case that with fit. The device it's self is attractive very thin and light.  I got the pink model and the nurses at the nursing home ooh and aah over the color.  If you are on the fence because its a generic model. I would highly recommend it.  I will bedefinitely be buying myself one when my samsung mega retires.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "PERFECT PINK PHONE", "Author": "CHARLENE A. MACKALL", "ReviewID": "R3PDLZ4ILCVLRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS PHONE IS FANTASTIC.  At first I was a little skeptical about ordering the phone; especially since I received a bad one from somebody else.  I also didn't know if this would work with consumer cellular.  Well it does, and I am loving the big screen. The pink color just puts this over the top. And yes, it comes with 2 batteries, a cover, a charger that can be attached to your computer, and a protective plastic cover already attached. This phone is better than any phone I've received from the major carriers.  It has a 4.2.2 operating system with play store.  I just can't say enough about this phone.  If you are looking for an unlocked pink phone, this is the one.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "T D.", "ReviewID": "R3H6RIUISJ1MXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my phone its pretty in pink with a pink smart case included it came within two weeks so far I'm loving my new phone!!!!!", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "The description is a lie", "Author": "Darell106", "ReviewID": "RADG8K31DCTXP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone I got was 6mp back and 5mp front.

The screen is very big, and I think it is a plus since there are so many people got themselves blind after staring at a small screen for a long time.You can use either the old SIM card or the new smaller one on this phone. The phone is really pretty and the case they gave you complements it. The trick of putting on the case is you need to take off the back shell first. The case is a flip case and one side of the case works as the back shell of the phone.The shipment was fast consider the phone was sent from China. I got my phone yesterday and on the very same day, I decided to buy another one (the white one) for my mom. I really appreciate the seller for providing us such great experience.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "LET ME DOWN", "Author": "Brian Williams", "ReviewID": "R12M7TXDMBL7KX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone very very good till 3 days later the phone just stopped charging in like wut wut happend all of a sudden my wife told me tht it sounded like something was frying then it stopped..
