It has crystal clear reception, and gets reception when no one else can pick one up. This particular phone has a basic front, but only all of the features can be accessed by using the qwerky keyboard. So you have to open it up to utilize all of it's features. And there are plenty of them! Right now I am using their GPS navigator to drive New York and D.C. without much hitches. I don't use the on-line features, but they would be easy to get to if I did. So a 3G cell phone that can be used as a smart phone or a regular phone. Can't get much better than that.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this phone!

So far I'm thrilled with it!  Love the look and feel of the phone.. it's very cute and stylish! I don't understand why Verizon discontinued this particular model for those who may want the basic talk and text features, which is a lot nicer looking than the present basic cell phones they are now offering. I decided to switch from my LG Smartphone, and I'm really glad I did. I wanted a phone that functions more like an actual phone. I don't need all the bells and whistles that comes with a Smartphone, as I have enough devices with a variety of features that satisfies all of that, without the added expense of all the required data and more.  I now have a good quality functioning phone, which costs considerably less per month and delivers the goods! It holds a charge better than the Smartphone. I had inquired here online about whether this had e-mail capability, and by the way, I wanted to thank all of those people who shared in their comments about that feature here at Amazon.  It does have email capability and web capability, but it's pretty limited. In retrospect, I don't really miss it. I have other ways to handle that function, and I find that the text messaging feature is quite adequate. All in all, I just like not having to climb a mountain to figure out how to answer the phone or worry about whether the phone has lost much or most of its charge at the end of the day. This was a chronic problem and my experience with dealing with the Smartphone. I don't really like the virtual keyboard either. I found I ended up using a Logitech Blue Tooth Keyboard for any type of text messaging.(By the way that Logic Tech Keyboard is the best little keyboard I've ever used!) Virtual keyboards are good in small doses, but not great for accurate and swift typing. The reception on the LGEnv is awesome!The Verizon staff simply made the switch and took care of everything, including keeping my pictures and my contact list, for a modest charge of $10.00.Overall I feel I made a \"Smart Choice\" to lose the \"Smart Phone\" and stay with something that works like a phone. I think this phone the LG Env3VX9200 should be called the \"New Smart Phone\".", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "Fashion Mom", "ReviewID": "R3KV8Q6GROILXY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son loves this phone.
