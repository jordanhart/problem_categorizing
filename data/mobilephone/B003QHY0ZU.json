Hermann \"Roger In Chicago\"", "ReviewID": "R16DJDSVNQHT2O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a phone that I could use when traveling to Europe. So GSM was the requirement. I had been using a Droid on Verizon's network. I do like the Android OS better. However this phone has a lot of features for a low price. The WIFI lets me get online or check my email when near a hotspot without having to have a data plan. I really like the lock button on the side of the phone because my droid kept calling people randomly when the screen did not lock. The phone arrived promptly and I have yet to travel to Europe to verify that it will work with a network there, but I am quite sure it will.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Software on the phone is no user friendly. Beware of  warranty", "Author": "Jiju Raj \"JR\"", "ReviewID": "R1OR87YFL0QXM6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone couple of months ago; honestly I hate this phone for couple of reasons.1. Once you dial a number,  phone's software auto locks the screen by not allowing to do anything, (for example if we need to dial an extension or activate speakerphone)it becomes harder because of the screen locking software. It is default software and it cannot be disabled sadly.2. Some time the reception signal is very bad it would not automatically come up whereas phone needs to be rebooted.3. US customer's please don't be fooled by international warrant, because Samsung USA will not support you even for small technical help.4. Web browser is poorly built (hard to read) and by default it is made for Vodophon network.My recommendation is please spend couple of hundred dollars extra and buy a better phone.5. Only good part of this phone is its design. No doubt this phone is sleek and eye pleasing.Hope this review would help.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "PyP", "ReviewID": "R1D5DCKDSQ5GTW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this cellphone unlocked because i need it to use it in the US with a sim card form Argentina, and then when i travel there it \"would work\", im complete happy with it, it works even better than what i thought, its easy to use, the touch screen is very fast, nice camera, i love the \"lock key\" in one of the side as my last cellphone was always calling people from my contact list....

It works well. It has a great battery life. So I am not totally disappointed, and I will keep the phone. But, I can already see that I will end up getting something else that has more social netowrking capabilities. The phone is equipped with apps like facebook and twitter, but I have to constantly log on to the site to be notified of any updates. I am use to my other phone that had notifications sent to my phone anytime I had a request or a message from any website. The phone doesn't link to facebook contacts or calender. My instant messaging applications are always logging themselves off and it doesn't alert me if someone sends me a message. I find the phone actually to be sort of basic. It is no where near up to par as social networking can be. It has a foward facing camera, but no applications like skype or google talk that actually work with it. I am going to China, and staying connected with people back home is important. This phone doesn't garantee that at all.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "1-of-Many", "ReviewID": "RYYD3LCTL1Y0H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Product And Fast Shipment...I Was Skeptical At First But Overall Iam Very Pleased...The Touch Screen is very responsive and handles like a dream.
