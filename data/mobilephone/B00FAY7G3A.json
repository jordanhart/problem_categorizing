I got the S4 but this phone did not fit in GF's hands.  We looked at other phones and this one by far met the bill and fit perfectly.The only bad thing is that OtterBox does not make a case for it.If you are looking for an updated phone, this one will not disappoint.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "First Android", "Author": "David P. Emrich", "ReviewID": "R11VSVCB2RDRS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For years went with cheap(free) flip phone from another carrier.  Coverage not as good as ATT, but cheaper.  Then saw 3GS iPhone when iPhone 4 came out, for $49 with a two year contract, and the contract was cheaper than what I was paying for a flip phone.  Whole new world.  Upgraded to iPhone 4 thinking it would be 4G, but need 4S for that, too much more money.  Two year contract.  One year in, phone would freeze, act real slow, bought this at $289, very happy with.  Think Apple's day is done.  Had two Apple computers, was a fan of, but now pc, and Android.  Times change.  May look at Galaxy S4 when contract is up, but this was a good way to test the Android waters.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this if you are looking for a phone and not a tablet", "Author": "G. Grosskopf \"George\"", "ReviewID": "R3GV681L3RZPC9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you want a tablet that happens to have a phone than this is good for you but ifyou want a phone that happens to have a tablet do not buy this phone.I'm driving and asked the phone to call someone and it said no network connection - my old dumb phone didn't need a network connection to register my voice and make the call.  Every time you open an APP you have to change pages to actually close the APP; otherwise, it continues to run in the background: they do not offer a button to close the app (changing pages is tough when driving).  If you want to connect this phone to your computer via USB, your computer (windows) will tell you it needs a CDC Serial and an RNDIS driver.  When I called SAMSUNG to get the driver their help desk said they don't have it, it's not on their web page.  I couldn't find the drivers on the net either (why did they design it to require an APP you cannot find).  Battery life with bluetooth and WIFI on is a little more than a day or two.If you want a tablet, this phone is similar to the Google tablet with connections to Google play (their app store).", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FAY7G3A"}}
