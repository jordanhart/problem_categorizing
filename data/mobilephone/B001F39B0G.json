I have to say that I was a little concerned about \"slickdeals4you\" since they really did not have much of a website that I could find and the only contact was via a hotmail address.But since it was being ordered through Amazon I figured I'd be covered if there was a problem. As it turned out, the phone arrived right on time. It's a great phone if you do a lot of texting since it has the full qwerty keyboard. Call quality was fine. It's a fairly large, bulky phone though.However, after a few weeks it developed a problem with the screen. It would regularly display an unreadable, garbled mess. I contacted the seller via email and received a prompt response. In fact, I ended up emailing him several times over several days and he always responded quickly and politely.He advised me that I was within the 30 day return period and that I could return it for replacement, which I did. I received the replacement phone exactly 7 days (including weekends) from the day I shipped the defective phone to him.

A message pops up on the phone constantly saying that the back is not in place and he has to remove the battery cover and replace it.

At first she didn't have any problems with it, but after a month the screen started to glitch. Then a couple months later her battery died and she lost all her important stuff she had saved to her phone. And recently the charger won't work right if she moves it a little bit it stops charging. She doesn't get half of her text messages or they won't send and she has to shut the phone off and turn it back on. She said that the activation screen shows up on hers once a day. Also the scroll ball stopped working, sometimes when it works she has to push on it 6 or 7 times to click on something or it decides to move and click on something else. She has babied that phone and it's having all those problems. She also got tired of when she'd turn it off and then turn it back on she had to set the date and time.
