{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The (New)ONE to Rule Them All!", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R2KB2VGLSOPPNO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love HTC phones and I have both last year's One(m7) and this year's(m8). I am NOT affiliated with HTC or compensated by them in any way. I just feel that competition and the underdog companies are crucial and essential for a healthy free market economy, and ultimately, us consumers. I have had the iPhones 4 through 5s, Samsung Galaxy S3/S4 and Note 2/3, and several Nokia(n95-97, n84/85 and several lesser phones) and Sony/Sony-Ericsson(Xperia) phones over the years, and I have loved most of them. For a healthy and positive technological evolution, we NEED the small or struggling companies like HTC to succeed. If Apple and Samsung become duopolies, that will be a dark future indeed. Pick up an HTC One(M7 or M8) and any Samsung Galaxy phones and compare the quality and craftsmanship, and tell me why it's Samsung and not HTC that have more successful phones. It's all about the MONEY and marketing, the bigger guy trying to squeeze out the smaller guy, and that's NOT how a healthy free market economy should be.Now that that is out of the way, let us get down to the nitty gritty. This is my direct comparisons to the iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 and Note 3, but mainly to the last HTC One(M7)(and yes, I am mainly updating keypoints from the m7 review):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5s is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the 2013 HTC One's(M7) screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 5.0\" 1080p(440ppi) form. The main difference between the M8 and the M7 is the color reproduction on the M8 is better and more true-to-life. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Once again, the new One continues the HTC tradition of making really high-quality phones with high-class material and craftsmanship. This version has more of a matted-brushed aluminum finish than the glossier M7. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other issue). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5/5s. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication, unlike the plastic-y feel of the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5. The One is one real looker!3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution. Compared to the M7, the M8 loses the Beats audio engineering, but it actually sounds louder than the M7, which although has really high-quality speakers as well, was known for being too soft in certain scenarios. The new moniker is just BoomSound.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick! What's really cool about the new camera is the duo camera functionality - each photo you snap is recorded from both cameras, so afterwards, you can re-focus the image, ala Lytro camera style. This is really cool and quite revolutionary for a phone camera. So in the real world, this means no more out-of-focus photos! You can now always re-focus your photos after the fact, so you will not have to regret missing out on a great memory because your photo was out of focus - awesome!5) For a phone with a 5\" screen, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 3. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance. However, it is very TALL, even taller than the M7, so trying to reach the power button with one hand while your holding it in a normal position is almost impossible. HOWEVER...6) The One borrows the features of the LG G2 where you can double tap on the screen while it's off, to turn it on! While the screen is off, you can swipe left to turn it on to see Blinkfeed, which is HTC's version of Flipboard/news reader, and swipe right to turn it on to the home screen. The one thing HTC forgot though, is you can't double-tap the screen while it's on, to turn it off, which the LG G2 CAN do.7) The user interface(UI) and software design is now even more polished,minimal, and simplistic. Sense 6.0 is the on-going improvement from the previous versions. It's really quick and light, not bloated like Samsung's TouchWiz UI. It improves on the older, but still good, Sense 5.0 and 5.5. You can move from one screen to the next lightning quick, almost as good as the iPhone UI.8) And FINALLY, HTC has included a microSD slot so you can add your own memory card for more storage(the HTC DNA/Butterfly and M7 didn't have any). You can add up to 128gb more!The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2600mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. At least it is a lot better than the M7's 2300mAh battery, which drains super quick, yet charges SUPER SLOW.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4/S5, the One is not as good. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news. The coolest feature so far for the One has been the tap/swipe to turn the screen on.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4/S5, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4/S5's fancy functions. The S5's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light, and with a more true color reproduction. The S5 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S5 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S5 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the new HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones(at least for now!).", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Arguably the best ONE", "Author": "WiseShopper", "ReviewID": "R32BCT0NYLE1ZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You are probably interested in buying a new phone but having a hard time choosing the right phone because of all the choices that are out there. After researching the best phones that are available or soon to be available (HTC One M8 and the Samsung S5) for weeks, I pulled the trigger on the M8 and picked one up when it was released to Verizon. The LG G3 is too far away to be considered. I can't tell you how awesome this phone is without writing 10 pages but I will try to keep it short and straight to the point. I hope this review helps you decide if this is the phone for you and why this is the best overall phone available right now. Honestly do not get the S5, because you will regret it. If you want a plastic phone that is powerful and probably the best in the Spec department, just wait for the LG G3. It is coming near the summer of this year and it will have amazing performance and the best display. It will probably outperform all phones including M8, but I will be happy with my HTC M8 because there isn't or will be any better looking phone that also has competitive specs this year.Why and who should get this phone?People who want a phone that:-Is well crafted and probably the most beautiful phone ever made (yes better design and materials than iPhone)-is one of the fastest phone currently available-Can live without having the best camera-Simply works without buggy software crashing and want a smooth android experience-Is one of the best phones available this year-Is a solid phone that is 90% metal and feels elegant to hold in your hand-Has very good battery life (not the best) but most people will be satisfied-Makes other people wish they had a sexy phone like it, even iPhone users-Has many \"cool\" features like motion launch, dual camera, step counter, IR blaster to be used as a remote for TVs and more, double tap to wake up, few other tricks that make it fun and easy to useWho should buy something else?People who want a phone that:-Is an iPhone (Apple lovers)-Is a Windows Phone (Microsoft lovers)-Is slightly faster but mostly plastic-Has an amazing camera and loves taking highest quality pictures with a phone-Has the best battery life and does not have a car charger-Is ugly with amazing performance and unnecessary specs.Skip this paragraph if you don't care to know what type of person is giving you this information:It is very difficult to choose a phone today because of all the choices that are available. But I finally found the ONE without compromising much. I want to give a little background about myself before you think I am just an average smart phone user. Like many of you I always want the hottest gadgets and especially the best phone. I honestly love iPhone's design but I hate their software and that is why I have always used Android phones. A few of my previous phones include: HTC EVO 3D, Galaxy S3, Droid DNA, Galaxy S4. I also had the Nokia Lumia for a very short period of time and I was not impressed by the phone or the Windows software. The only reason I did not get the original One (M7) is because of the lack of microSD slot.HERE I WILL LIST THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF THE PHONE WITH RATING COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES THAT ARE AVAILABLE OR WILL BE SOON:Overall Rating 9.6/10Positives:Design 10/10 : Arguably the most well designed phone available right nowPerformance 10/10 : One of the, if not the fastest phone currentlyDisplay 9/10 : Easily the top 3 displayExtra Features 9/10 : Missing few extras (fingerprint, heart rate monitor) but it has other features that makes up for it.Storage 10/10: Finally a microSD slot that supports up to 128GB and it has a 32GB model.Software 9.5/10: HTC Sense UI is the closest OEM software that is as awsome as the stock Android UI, I personally like the HTC sense more, it is smooth and not buggy like the Samsung TouchWiz. It has useful apps such as: BlinkFeed, Sense TV, and FitBit can be downloaded serperately and the sensors provide very acurate step counts.Negatives:Battery 8.5/10 : The battery life is above average but could have been a little better. Overall it's better than 92% of other phones. Not bad at all. A new update called \"Extreme Power Saving\" is soon to be released and it will help save a lot of battery when you turn it on, almost 70% increase. It basically turns off useless services and will probably increase the rating to 9/10.Camera 8/10 : Kind of disappointed because so many other phones have better cameras (iPhone 5s, Galaxy S4, LG G2, etc). There was no upgrade to the camera from the previous model. But I give it a 8 because the camera is decent and it has other interesting features that make up for the slightly low resulution. The camera is not bad by any means, its just not excellent. It is the first phone with dual camera and it can do some breathtaking and useful trick to the pictures using the depth information captured by the second camera. Overall I am happy with the camera.As you can see the phone is just too good to have extreme negatives, the negatives are just slightly below what is expected of a smartphone in my opinionBelow are more specific details of the phone, read if you pleaseDesign 10/10: \"This is the best looking phone in the world right now\" and that's a fairly accurate statement. Some might disagree but not many. The pictures does not do enough justice, it is truly gorgeous to look at and to hold. It feels like holding a metal artwork. It feels very solid and premium in my hands. I am only 5'3 and I have fairly small hands and I honestly think it is the perfect size, maybe 5% longer than I hoped for. Overall it's hard to find a well-crafted and more beautiful phone than the HTC M8, yes it is more elegant than the iPhone. Don't worry it is not all about design, it packs some serious power.Performance 10/10 : Let's just say it is the fastest phone available right now according to the benchmark tests I have done. The phone is amazingly smooth, everything just opens up instantly. I have not experienced one bit of lag or any errors. The Sense UI is closest as you can get to the stock Android UI experience with any OEM UI. The Samsung Touchwiz and LG UI is a mess compared to the Sense. The Qualcomm 801 processor is a fast and efficient processor. I can almost guarantee you that performance will not disappoint you.Display 9/10: The phone gorgeous inside out. The picture quality is extremely sharp and vibrant. It is easily top 3 in the graphic department. It is very bright and crystal clear. But there are a few phones currently out that outperform the display. My brother's LG G2 has a slightly better display. I hoped for it to be number one in this department but overall its nothing to complain about.Battery 8.5/10: With all the advances in technology I am not sure why there has been such little innovation in the battery field. It is not just cell phone batteries but all batteries in general. Some manufacture like Motorola has done decent job with providing large batteries in recent years. HTC has always disappointed me in this department and this phone is no exception. But I have to admit it is above average and I am fairly satisfied so far. I am able to go through an entire day without a problem. My day starts at 6 and ends at 7. My normal usage include: Frequent texting, 1-2 hours of talking, 3-4 hours of surfing and email, 30-45 minutes of games and the rest standby. I am able to get through the entire day but honestly most of us have chargers at work and in our cars. So overall I am not too obsessed over battery but the M8 does provide fairly decent battery life. Most of the tests reported a full day of normal to somewhat heavy use and I can confirm that. It was supposed to come with a setting called \"Extreme Power Saver\" but apparently it will be provided soon with an update. It supposed to limit the phone to only email, phone, text and few other basic things to save a lot of battery. Supposably up to 70% more battery. I can't comment on it until I receive the update.Extras 9/10: What's a flagship phone without some tricks? The M8 has some cool tricks up its sleeve.Camera Affects: I will complain about the camera quality later but let me state the positives in this section. Basically the camera has some tricks that help me deal with the moderate quality of the images. My brother has a$1200 DSLR camera that he uses to take cool pictures and I can do the same now with my $600 new phone. My favorite feature is the U-Focus which blurs the background and focuses on the object, like your face. Obviously the DSLR camera does an exceptional job but most people can't tell the difference with the first glance. The second camera on the device captures depth information and you can add cool affects to the pictures after you take it using that information. There few other ones like Sketch and Cartoon and Zoom effect but I find the U-Focus to be the most interesting one. But most people will use all of them because they work very well and are very easy to customize a picture.Motion/Sensors Stuff: My favorite trick is double tapping the screen to wake it up and turn it off. It's amazing how this simple feature can be so useful. I hated pressing the power button to turn on the display and now all I have to do is tap the screen. I can also swipe from the bottom to top in order to unlock the device and go to the last app I had open. You don't have to go to the lock screen, you can directly go to the home screen if you don't have a passcode setup. Swiping from right to left take you to the awesome BlinkFeed screen. Swiping from top to bottom brings up google now (voice command). Swipping from right to left take you to the home screen. The final motion trick is answering the phone by simply lifting the phone to your ear. Thre is also a feature where you hold the phone in landscape orientation and press the volume up to activate the camera app.FitBit App: The phone has a built in barometer and bunch of other sensors that can track your steps very accurately. Most phones have some of the sensors but only the iPhone and Nexus 5 has all the sensors like the M8. As a result the M8 and the few other phones can track your steps very accurately without buying a pedometer like the FitBit Flex or Force. The FitBit app was supposed to come preinstalled but you can easily download it from the play store for free. I am currently using it to track my steps and its about 96% accurate.Remote for TV and more: The M8 has an IR Blaster built in, you can control all your electronics with your phone. HTC has this app called \"Sense TV\", it's very interesting and useful. You basically select your cable provider and select the channels you have and the app gives you show times and what's currently playing based on your favorite stations and shows. Basically it's a smart guide on your phone and you simply click on the show and your cable box will bring up the show. The setup is easy, you simply select your cable box model, TV model, home theater model and you can control all of them using your phone. But I highly recommend getting this app called \"IR Smart Remote\", it's about $6 and it is the best remote app for your phone. You can basically throw away all your remotes and use your phone to control everything; it does a very similar job as the Harmony remotes. Do some research on it, you may like this app.Camera 8/10: Compared to all the other phones available, I am very disappointed at with the picture and video quality of the main camera. It is the same exact camera as the previous model except it has an extra camera. The picture quality is not bad but it is not excellent like many other phones. The main problem is the lack of resolution and bright light pictures. If there is too much light, for example capturing the sky in a sunny day might be hard; the picture doesn't capture blue sky properly. Overall it's a decent camera but I was expecting more. It is an average and maybe slightly below average camera.Final Verdict: If you want a beautiful, fast, elegant and a phone that simply works, then just get this phone as soon as you can. I know many people are comparing the Galaxy S5 and honestly the S5 has several advantages but the HTC One M8 is the clear winner to me. If you don't mind the plastic and somewhat of a bland look, then get the S5. If you want the most elegant phone that is available, then get the M8.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Although Something Feels Missing", "Author": "C. Hernandez", "ReviewID": "RCZP9AIGUI8SO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Unsure on how to start this review. Overall I am happy with the NEW HTC ONE. The design and aesthetics of the device is the best of all flagship phones. It is so well made and beautiful to hold, touch and look at. The iPhone has always held the crown on construction, but I think the HTC One deserves that title now.The screen of this device is gorgeous. Colors are accurate and everything just pops. Prefer it over AMOLED screens. The 1080p 5 inch screen is great for watching videos and playing games. Able to read e-books comfortably, although nothing can match a dedicated reading device like a Kindle and their e-ink technology.The Boomsound Speakers are just as great as the first HTC One, if not better. Music played via the loudspeaker is loud and crystal clear. For music lovers who enjoy listening to their music and videos without the aid of headphones; nothing compares.Network connectivity is stable and great. Able to get high speed connectivity on Verizon's LTE Network without issue. Average download speeds of 16Mbps and average Upload speeds of 12Mbps. Please note! that this is highly dependent on location and population size using the network at the time. Average speeds will be different for all. Overall I'm able to retain stronger signal than any of my previous devices.The inclusion of a micro-sd slot is a welcome add-on. I am now able to carry all my music, photos, and a few HD videos with me at all times. No longer do I have to pick and choose what I want to carry on my device. Carrying a Class 10, 64gb microsd card at the moment which is enough room for me given that the HTC One comes with an extra 32gb of storage.Other features that I enjoy are the IR-blaster which works like a charm. I'm Able to control my TV and Cable box directly from my device without issue. NFC technology is something i have not used much except for transferring pictures to buddies but I was recently introduced  to open an Isis account and I must just say \"WOW\". I am now a faithful user of such payment technology. I have used it a few times since receiving the device and it works. Can simply use my device for payment instead of my cards. Just place your phone on the NFC payment hub (same device used to swipe your credit cards) dial in your security pin, and presto. I only hope that more vendors start taking advantage of this technology because it really works.The front facing camera is superior to anything out in the market. Picture are of high quality and look great. Unfortunately the front facing camera is the only camera to get excited about.Now for the small caveats that makes me think twice about keeping the device.As I said before, the 5 inch screen of the device is gorgeous but HTC failed here by including the menu buttons on the screen itself vs dedicated buttons below. I have always hated this set up, given that it takes away from having the full screen real estate at your disposal. I don't understand why they went this route. The bezel below the screen is just as big as their first HTC One and could of easily accommodated these buttons with ease.The metal design is beautiful but my god is it slippery. I highly recommend you buy a minimalist case with this device, you will drop this phone without one. The metal finish is beautiful but it is hard to keep a proper grip on it.The Boomsound Speakers are within a class of its own. Loudspeaker performance is awesome but I wish that such performance transferred over when receiving calls. I don't think the earpiece gets loud enough when talking on the phone via the top earpiece, which is odd. HTC must of tuned down the earpiece speaker capabilities during calls. I mean the device is more than capable of outputting higher volumes during calls, but seems a bit low to me.Lastly the Camera. Once again we have a 4 Ultrapixel camera. Every other vendor is going bigger but HTC decided to stay small and improve on \"quality\", or so they say. I'm sorry but although it is true that megapixels aren't everything to a good photo, they do help. This is the deciding factor that might or will have me return the device and wait on the Galaxy S5. I have taken various shoots with the HTC One and they do come out great (when viewing them on the phone) but the same cant be said when viewing them on my Macbook Pro. I cant zoom into anything for editing because there is just not enough resolution to play with. The photos are great for viewing on the device and sharing them on Facebook but they are not good for post editing on a higher resolution screen such as my Mac. The \"secondary\" top camera being used to capture depth works, but only under the right conditions. Most of the time U-Focus (name of the top camera module) seems to be more of a software fix and not an actually camera capable of measuring depth. Some picture come out great, while others do not blur correctly. It makes me question the capability of the U-Focus camera.Overall the HTC One is a great device with few issues, which is a shame too. I love the look and feel of the device. It screams premium but upon closer look it just isn't for me. Others will have a great time with this device and speak highly of it but the camera just didn't do it for me.Update June 05, 2014Initially I wasn't very impressed with the HTC One M8 but I have to go ahead and give a deserving update. I have changed my review from a 3 star to a 4 and I will say why below.I gave up on the HTC One M8 early on and switched to the Galaxy S5. Over 30 days later I couldn't continue liking or recommending the S5 for various reasons and went back to the HTC One M8; only this time I went with the BestBuy Gold edition. Although the Galaxy S5 is an overall excellent powerhouse of a Smartphone, it does have its issues. First and foremost it lags considerable. I can't tell you how many times I have had the phone dragging at a slower pace than my rapid fingers. I constantly had to wait for the keyboard to pop up to commence typing and pages had an issue of freezing. Worst of all was the slow speeds I witnessed when launching the camera app and snapping the first picture. I continued to lose the perfect photo moment due to how long it would take to start up. The Galaxy S5 does still have the superior camera (no questions about that) but I disliked the constant waiting for the camera app to launch.Overtime the Galaxy S5 began to feel more to what it was.... cheap plastic, It took some time, but after a while I felt I was holding something less premium than what I originally believed on day one.The S5 also isn't the best performer when it comes to call quality. I found myself asking people to repeat themselves because I had a hard time understanding the words coming through the top earpiece. The HTC One M8 differs in this area since its call quality is loud and crystal clear and just better overall in this aspects. Sometimes we forget that our Smartphones should be a phone first and then some. Im not sure if it was a software update or my disappointment with the S5 but I am enjoying the HTC One much more than I initially did.", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best SmartPhone I've had.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1B9UYLP8M2W7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was an iPhone guy until the release of iPhone 5.  That's when I switched from my iPhone 3G to a Samsung S3.  At first I liked my S3, but in time I found it was failing in several key areas... although the specs were good on it's camera - the camera produced lifeless images.  The UI of the Samsung had a lot of issues for me and it was loaded with tons of carrier/samsung apps that were killing my performance.I just recently upgraded again to a HTC One M8.  I reviewed it against the S5.  There's a lot of Samsung people who seem to have a need to knock this phone - especially for the camera.  I have to say, I don't see the limitation. I realize it's only a 4Megapixel camera, but it's quality is pretty amazing. It's immediate usefulness is also nice.  Just click, shot taken.  Instant refocus using ufocus ... the Zoe video maker is pretty slick too.uFocus:It's basically a social camera.  It's not going to give you images you are going to turn into canvas wall art at 11x17\" or larger.  It can't do that with a  4 MP camera.  Nor will it produce Super HDR Video.  But what it will do is give you fun social tools - like the camera... it's ufocus is much better then the other alternatives I've tried.  Samsung has a selective focus, which you do post photo. I found it failed to be accurate 80% of the time I used it. Most images I see with it, have large parts of the background in focus, along with the foreground.  That isn't to suggest that uFocus is 100%... it fails too at times, but at a much lower scale - i find somewhere around 10% of my shots have issues with uFocus.  There's ways to work around the limitation, but you may still get some non defocused material showing up. However Samsung's selective focus is pretty bad, leaving large sections of background mixed with foreground - and a lot more often.  Google Camera has a defocus ability... but it requires a lot of work.  You have to take multiple shots. You start out with the first shot, then move your camera upwards while it takes more shots.  It gets a good result, ONLY if you do it right.  I found in the lighting in my living room it wouldn't even work.  This of course won't work for fast moving targets (like kids!)  If you have kids running around and you are trying to use Google Camera to get the defocus, it's most likely it won't work, the'y'll have moved out of the frame by the second or third shot it takes.  What I've read/seen in the new Xperia Z2 coming out, is that their defocus requires an actual mode you go into.  Then you take two shots.  It then lets you blend the images, and it merges the focus/defocused images per your liking.  In the HTC One uFocus: it's simple... you have to be in Auto mode and you take a picture.  That's it.  You click and it refocuses.  There are limitations... 1) you can't refocus if the image was taken in a special mode  2) you can't refocus if the image was altered and saved out (you loose the depth info if you adjust the image and save it)  3) if the light is too low it may not work.  4) if you use a flash it won't work.  I found it worked in my living room, using nominal lighting (at night).  But if you are in a dark resturaunt, the image you take may not be refocus able.  it just depends on those above factors.For all daytime shots, I never had a problem.  For all shots in doors I didn't have a problem (where Google Camera did have a problem.)Zoe:Zoe is pretty slick.  You go into your images, and it will select random ones and apply a music soundtrack and video effect to them.  You can also pick the images/video you want, and then the theme and music (even your own music) and it will apply a cool flowing video from your content. It's really impressive.Could a person do better with post processing software like iMovie?  Maybe... but then you'd also have to download the video/pictures, get some music together, put it together yourself and adjust all the effects, movements, zooms, etc.  Zoe is there to give you a quick and fun video of your content... not be an aftereffects replacement.UI:I love the UI.  I never liked the Samsung S3 UI.  The UI on Samsung S3 was confusing for many people who used my phone... they found it too confusing to do basic things like send a text message... why?  Because the carrier + samsung + android all have their own software to do each thing... so you had like 3 ways to do almost everything.  You are constantly asked \"do you want this to be your default software choice in the future?\" and no matter what you say you'll get prompted again for the same action tomorrow!Not so with the HTC One M8.  I have the T-Mobile version, and it has little carrier apps... and the apps and UI work together... It doesn't feel like 3 different parties are living on your phone and not working congruently together (like my old Samsung.)  It is so slick, that my wife who is an avid iPhone user... was thinking this looked more fun to use then her 5S.What about all the hype on the camera not being as good as a iPhone/S5 etc?Ignore what people are saying... reviews that deal with 100% crop sharpness are pointless. You want to see what the best this camera can do, not the worst.  My advice... go to flickr.com and do a search for \"htc one m8\" and see the images and video that come up.  Do that for any phone/camera you are considering.  Many times you'll see pictures straight out of the camera with no post processing.  Look at uFocus and decide if the results you see look pleasing.  Check out Zoe on youtube of Viemo and see if they have results that are pleasing.Slo-motion video:it also does slow motion video... I found it does a great job at this, but you are limited to 720p at slow motion. Other cameras probably shoot slow motion at higher resolution.  So if that's important, it may be a drawback.Dual Camera shots/video:Something I don't see reviewed/mentioned often is the dual camera capture... there is a mode where it will shoot video or take still images with both the front and back cameras... it's pretty cool. That way people can see the main footage, and your face cam at the same time.selfie camera is 5mp:I don't do much selfies, but again, to the social aspect of the camera... the selfies are 5MP (one of the highest around.)  It's also a wide angle lens... so it captures more then the back lens.Camera Settings:I don't know if the S5 does this, but the camera can be saved out as different cameras - each version having it's own settings... like you could have a low light camera setting saved, a camera with +2EF saved, etc.  Then you click the named camera with those settings and are instantly in that mode.Guesture controls:if you have the camera in landscape lift it up, and click the volume button, it goes straight into camera mode.  pretty fast access to the camera.Downsides:  - main camera is only 4MP, but... the main limitation here is no zoom or cropping later.  - HDR Video (I haven't tried, but from what I've seen) is flickery and awful.  - slow motion is only 720pUpsides:  - Awesome back camera (despite neg. reviews)  - selfie camera is 5mp  - Great social features (that's what this phone is all about.)  - Slick UI (even my wife who is an avid iPhone user is drawn to this phone.. the first time an android every was pleasing for her to use)  - metal construction feels great.  - uFocus works pretty well compared to it's rivals (Samsung's selective focus, Google Camera and the Z2.)", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone so far!", "Author": "RC Golfer", "ReviewID": "RMCBPM3PD1DDN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Switched from Apple 4s because I wanted a larger screen and wasn't prepared to wait for 6 months for the iPhone 6.

Coming from an Galaxy S3, this device looked to be a nice upgrade, and it surely didn't disappoint.  I was also waiting for the Galaxy S5, but I went ahead to pull the trigger and I'm glad I did.Hands-On Impressions:Exterior body / Design -Wow.  I thought the pictures for this beauty looked good, and then I came across this phone in-person.  I actually got the Glacial Silver version instead of the featured Gunmetal Grey, but I got a chance to see both.  The silver is the almost exact same as the silver from last year's model, so if you've seen the HTC One from last year, you will know what to expect.  It is a bright non-glossy silver with a hint of shiny accents around the rim of the body and the camera lens.  Metal wraps all the way around the sides, and the only plastic I can make out are the thin white strips on the back and the black piece on top of the phone, which I think is an IR blaster used for remote control.The Gunmetal Grey version is noticeably darker, with brushed aluminum accents wrapping around the back and parts of the front (the top and bottom strips where the Boomsound speakers are).  Under direct light, the metal almost looks dark brown, but it is still definitely more on the grey side.  It's a more aggressive look compared to the silver, but the brushed aluminum finish helps it retain elegance.  I can see this color going very well with a dark case (maybe smoky black?)  The two-tone color scheme on the front of the device is less noticeable compared to the silver version, and this is as close as you can get to the all black version that was discontinued from last year (at least for now, no one really knows what other colors they will come out in the future).  I also heard that this grey version is made of stainless-steel instead of aluminum, but I'm not certain.I didn't get a chance to see the gold color in version, but I've seen videos and it looks like bright gold.  It's not the really shiny gold that blinds you, but it's bright enough where it doesn't seem dull.  I would say it looks like the Champagne gold on the iPhone 5S, except it is a tad brighter and has a stronger gold hue.  Keep in mind that the device is still made of metal, and it is not actually gold.Overall you can really go wrong with any of the colors.  I personally picked the silver, because the color is the most pure and refined compared to the Gunmetal Grey and Amber Gold, but I can see other people who prefer the grey and gold to make a bolder statement.Now onto the physical body shape.  This phone is definitely on the big side, and it's more on the tall side than anything else.  I would say this is very quickly approaching the \"phablet\" category, but it's still small enough where you don't have to use two hands all the time.  The 90% metal construction gives it a noticeable heft, and this is definitely not the thinnest phone out there in the market.  However, HTC did a really excellent job of shaping the curves, as this phone doesn't dig into your palm and rests nicely on your hand.  I really liked how the volume buttons are now easier to press, as the older buttons on the first HTC One were next to impossible to feel.  The micro-USB port and the 3.5 mm headphone jack are both on the bottom, with the volume rocker on the right and the power button on the top-right hand side.  One thing I dislike about the button placement is that the power button is harder to reach, but thankfully HTC has a software feature that takes care of this issue (more on that later).  The camera lens (both of them) are completely exposed on the back side, and there is no bulge around the lens to shield them when the phone is resting on a flat surface so keep that in mind.  Overall this phone is nicely built and designed, where the design means all business and looks very mature.  I would suggest getting a case for this phone, as the last thing this device needs is one big crack running across the display.  And speaking of display.........Display/screen - 1080P S-LCD3This display is hands down one of the best screens out there in the market.  The 1080P resolution on a 5 in. display comes at about 440 pixels per inch, and this is incredibly sharp.  This also means that it is virtually impossible for the human eye to distinguish individual pixels, and you would pretty much have to have your eyes touching the screen to tell the pixels apart (which I still think is impossible).  It's almost unbelievable to imagine that this display has the same resolution as most HDTV's in the market, all packed on a 5-in. screen.  Pictures are sharp, and videos offer ample detail.  The colors are also good as well, especially for an LCD.  Compared to other LCD's, this screen has a relatively high contrast, yet the color production remains very realistic.  Compared to AMOLED screens, you'll notice that the colors might not have as much pop and the blacks are not as deep, but what you get instead is a brighter screen with surprisingly accurate color reproduction.  Sunlight legibility was also good, but I have seen some other AMOLED displays to offer less reflection.Overall this display is pretty darn good, and the colors looked as if they were painted right on the screen.  I would have preferred the display to offer a little more contrast and saturation, but for an LCD screen it is definitely impressive.Software - HTC Sense 6.0 on top of Android 4.4.2 Kit KatLast time I extensively used HTC Sense was Sense 3.6 on the HTC Rezound, and Sense has definitely came a long way.  Sense 6.0 (or the Sixth Sense as HTC likes to call it) takes Sense 5.0 from last year's HTC One and makes it even more refined, so it's less in-your-face type of deal.  This version is the closest that Sense has ever gotten to pure Stock Android, but it offers some features that aren't on stock.  The home-screen pages are still organized in a horizontal fashion, with Blinkfeed on the left-most home screen pane.  For those who don't know, Blinkfeed is HTC's aggregator of information, where it takes information from sources and shows you the headlines in a clean and colorful catalog that you can scroll through.  Facebook, Twitter, CNN, ........the sources are almost endless.  You just pick your content and it will show up instantly.  This is very, very similar to the popular Flipboard app, but it also includes information such as your personal calendar events and tasks, so in a way it offers an extra dimension on top of the Flipboard experience.  You can always remove it from the Home Screen should you find the need to do so.Apps and icons are arranged almostly exactly like Stock Android, but the custom widgets will differ.  The notification area and settings are very similar to Stock as well.  One thing that HTC added to improve usability is the addition of motion gestures (I would say this is derived from what LG and Samsung did with their phones).  Performing a specific gesture will make the phone react in a unique way.  For example, double-tapping the screen when the phone is locked will wake the screen up (double-tapping again will put it back to sleep, but keep in mind that this only works on the lock screen as you cannot put the phone to sleep on the home screen. Also this solves the power button placement issue that was mentioned earlier).  Swiping the screen to the right during sleep will open Blinkfeed.  There are also a few other motion gestures, and allows people to get to what they need right away. All in all, the software experience is very clean and smooth, and I have yet to encounter a hiccup in the process.HTC still likes to offer chances to really personalize your phone, where you can change the color schemes and other aspects.  It's a nice addition because some people will find Stock to be a little boring.  I would say HTC has achieve a balance where there are enough customization options to keep the device fresh, but not to the point of being overwhelmed with extra tidbits.Performance / Battery Life -Performance-wise, this thing flies.  The quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor is able to manager numerous apps without a hint of stuttering, and everything feels snappy.  I'm not going to go into the Quadrant or Antutu or any sort of benchmark, but it is definitely a noticeable improvement in speed compared to last year's flagships.One of the biggest surprises with this phone was the battery life.  HTC has had a long history of making phones with poor battery life, and last year's HTC One was merely acceptable.  With this new One, HTC claims to have a 40% improvement, and this claim is accurate.  I never have the feeling of having to carry my charger with me, and I have confidence in this phone making it through the whole day, even with heavy usage.  I charge this every other day, but with my older Galaxy S3 I had to charge it every night (sometimes multiple times a day).  HTC knows battery life is going to be a big concern, and they effectively addressed this problem through software optimization and the use of an efficient processing chipset.Call Quality / Antenna Reception -Calls were very clear, even though I wished they were louder.  I didn't experience any dropped calls or moments where the conversation fell through.  As for the level of reception, it was decent, but not excellent.  Some phones like the older Motorola phones are able to get at least 1 bar of signal even in the most tight remote locations, and this HTC One is not quite up to that level yet.  So far I have not had any issues with reception, and I would say the signal connection is better than most.Camera -This phone uses the 4 ultrapixel configuration (technically still 4 MP) to take photos, plus it has an extra lens for depth focus.  The image quality is passable, not great.  The camera really shines under low-light conditions, but in normal instances the image quality needs improvement.  The sharpness of the photos is lacking, and there is quite a bit of noise coming from the background.  This is one area where I wished HTC would focus more on, but this is far from the worst camera I've seen.The camera software interface makes up for the image quality, as the phone enables you to change up the photos in various scenes and settings.  Some aspects of particular note are the UFocus feature and the 3D effect (I don't know if there is an official name for it).  UFocus allows you to shift the focus on various objects by blurring out other objects in the background, and this is starting to become a really common feature among the high-end phones.  The 3D effect allows you to tilt the camera after you have taken the photo in order to get a 3D peripheral around the object, very much like the Photo Sphere on Stock Android.  There are so many ways to tweak your photos where you might end up forgetting which is the original.Video quality is less of a letdown, but the 1080p recording falls behind the competition just a tad.  Motions are smooth, but the phone could use a bit more anti-shake counters to deliver a better video recording experience.Miscellaneous -Boomsound: This is HTC's front-facing dual stereo speaker system, and it pumps out really strong sound.  I was surprised that in addition to the volume output, the clarity of voices and instruments was very sharp, and the whole sound experience was very-well rounded.  This phone could almost clarify as a wireless speaker, and I never had to worry about missing a phone call because I couldn't hear the ringtone going off.HTC Advantage - This is their \"service program\" where it guarantees that you get a free replacement phone if you crack your screen in the first 6 months, software updates for 2 years, 50GB cloud storage for 2 years, and some other goodies.Conclusion - This is just a really quick rundown on the initial impressions of this phone, and I can tell this thing can hold its own ground for the time to come.  The premium design/build, gorgeous display, and outstanding processing performance are the biggest advantages for this machine, complemented by the stellar UI experience.  Even though the camera may leave much to be desired and the size may be a turn-off for some, the new HTC One M8 is made for the work-hard, play-hard enthusiast who seeks a reliable, well-rounded smartphone.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "So Glad I Picked This Up", "Author": "Rousey417AP", "ReviewID": "R1VKYEVV4FJZM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone.

I had a few co-workers try it and they agreed that it's like this thing was dipped in oil.  I don't mean this to be critical- just an observation.  A case is a necessity for me to keep from dropping it.Screen- it's beautiful but it is also huge.  I can't touch the top third of the screen when I'm holding the phone one-handed.  I have medium-sized hands for a guy.Speakers- I highly recommend going to a cell phone store and watching a movie trailer on this phone.  I didn't think I would particularly care about front-facing stereo speakers but now I realize what I have been missing.  It might be embarrassing to listen to something loud in the store but just do it so you can hear for yourself.  It's pretty cool.Battery- everyone's level of use varies so I won't comment on how long it lasts on one charge.  I'll just say I am happy with the battery life.  If you want to know how much electrical energy your current phone holds do a search like \"HTC One M8  mAh\" (but use your phone's model/name instead of the M8).  Once you know your phone's battery capacity you can compare it to the M8's, which has a 2400mAh battery.The only other thing I want to comment on are the gesture controls.  If you haven't read it already this phone has a built-in ability to unlock the phone from a black screen just by swiping up.  It sounds simple but I freaking love this feature.

I play a lot of ROMs on my phone so I would fill 32gb right away.

I know you've probably heard this so many times but the build of this device is just outstanding. Ok moving on now because there are other reasons to buy this phone. I'm personally a big fan of Sense 6. BlinkFeed is awesome once you set up your highlights list the way you like it. You can check Facebook Twitter and instagram from it and u can also get the latest tech news, celebrity news and whatever you want. It's great. If you don't like it however than you can easily get rid of it and save some battery power. Which brings me to my next point, the batter. On normal use (texting, calling, occasional internet usage, and BlinkFeed) I get about 34 hours of use out of the phone. On heavy use, and I mean HEAVY USE, where I dont put my phone down from full charge to zero charge I get about 7 hours of use. This is really good because during heavy use for me I'm either watching videos on YouTube or Netflix, I'm checking social feeds, making videos and listening to music non stop until the phone dies. Just so you know though, you never want your phone to get down to zero battery. It's best to charge your phone when it gets down to 50% and you want to charge it to about 95%. This will extend your battery life greatly. The UI of the HTC is awesome as well. Look up videos on how to get the developer option in settings and turn off your animations to make it even FASTER. Honestly you don't have to do this as the HTC has the best screen latency out of any phone on the market. Next is the camera. I know some of you are worried about this because it is only 4.1 UltraPixel. Coming from the galaxy S3 I can say that for me, the pictures are very good and slow motion video is my favorite thing to use. I'm constantly getting compliments on the quality of my pictures on Facebook and things like that. The Ufocus setting is a blast to use. The one down side of the camera is the zoom feature because the camera is only 4 pixels, the pic gets grainy when you zoom. Other than that I love it. I don't print my pics or transfer them to my laptop typically so I'm getting the best experience with the camera. Definitely a step up from the Galaxy S3. Phone quality is ridiculously clear and the speakers on the phone are as good as you're going to get with a smart phone. They're full of bass and loud as hell. I used to be an iPhone fan but the screen size was killing me and so we're the limitations to customize the layout. The HTC is fully customizable, it has great build quality, awesome speakers, cool camera, the best screen latency in the market and An intuitive UI. I almost forgot too, the screen quility is magnificent as well. In my opinion, it renders the most realistic image quality out of any other flagship device.

I've used many phones even have the Galaxy Note 3 and this compares quite well I love the build. Personally I use both on the same line go back and forth I like switching it up. The m8 uses the Nano Sam know nano SIM. So I have to use an adapter to go back to my micro sim in the note 3. Personally I like a build on a gadget in this one is built as good as they get. I've used it for almost a week now my only drawback would be the permanent battery I like to be able to switch back and forth with new battery. But the screen is totally whack great. And the speakers blow me away. I love the 4G reception it's better than my note 3 and also it's just snapped earlier and faster the note 3. Snappier and faster. Sorry using my voice to text and it will not let me correct my errors for some reason on my note 3.honestly 1 can go wrong with any of these know if entries into they android fieldcan't go wrong. I don't think I'm not one to nitpick. But I do need my note three things like the video editor and to be able to go lol dongle which I can't seem to do on the m8.I have no complaints about the camera the little bit I have used it I really like the pictures its very simple to use and as far as quality I ate can't see much difference between the camera on my note 3 and this m8.so anyway I have owned just probably a dozen different Android smartphones and iPhones included. I would still probably rate overall the note 3 as the best phone I have ever owned and this would be a close second. Followed by the note 2 in the 3-position and the s4 in the fourth position. Hope I help somebody with all my gibberish. Thank you would recommend a buying this phone if you're up for an upgrade I bought mine out right. Or I would lose my verizon unlimited.

There are many things that the M8 delivered but there some that I am still yearning for in the next HTC phone.Camera quality is an improvement that I see in the M8. Although the HTC One M8 does not improve on megapixel count nor ultrapixel count, the software has improved immensely. There are more features that the M7 did not have that leaves little to be desired from a photographer standpoint. I admit that the lack of improvement on megapixel count is disappointing but it suffices for the purpose phone cameras are intended for: social media. The low light ability on the M8's camera is superb and is surprising for a phone camera. As a photographer, I am amazed about the capabilities that I have on the M8. The manual mode and Ufocus is very useful and although it has some quirks, HTC can fix it with a simple software update through the google play store. With the manual mode, you can set custom exposure times, apertures, and ISO settings which is something that photographers use on the daily. With Ufocus, you can create amazing composition sound pictures by isolating your subject from the background making it a stronger image overall. If you are wanting to take the next step in your photography skills, this is definitely something that will become useful. The only problem that I have with the camera on the M8 is the organization of the UI. I find it hard to navigate through the menus. There are a set of menus that let you switch from camera to video, selfie mode, etc. and then there are another set of menus that let you choose which mode you want like manual mode, HDR, and panorama. This can get confusing and latter menu is hidden in the settings button. In addition, sometimes I forget to change from video to camera or visa versa and when I open up the camera app again, it goes to your last saved mode so I end up taking a video when I want to take a picture.The overall UI is much improved. There is a way that you can change the font, theme (though there is only a limited amount of colors), and blinkfeed content which was not found on the M7. However, most software is the same as the M7 now that it has been updated to Sense 6.The hardware is solid and much improved from the M7 and still unique compared to other phone manufactures. Besides apple, HTC is the only one that has nearly metal phone. Having a metal phone makes you it feel very solid in the hands and premium. From a design standpoint, it shows that the carrier has put a lot of thought with the curved body and the brushed aluminum. The boom sound feature also is a perk because it delivers loud volume quality sound. As a musician, this is one of the features that I enjoy because I can listen to music the way that the artist intended me to listen to. It is also good for social times when you don't have speakers or a computer to play music. It is loud enough to fill a room. I also like how the speakers are placed on the phone because it really amplifies the sound when they are the front. I hate to put my phone where the glass is facing the ground just so that i can hear the music coming from the speakers on the back.Among the flagship devices that are out, the HTC One M8 is the top contender. It still brings quality features that many competitors have not included yet in their device. It looks great and it feels like a flagship device. I would recommend this to those who are very much into the latest and greatest. Also, it is very easy to use and can be enjoyed by everyone who doesn't find tech their forte.", "Date": "June 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "R1989SK3CF3Q99", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My only review on Amazon.  Did not buy here but Verizon, but had to voice displeasure.Headphone jack broke after 9 days of owning phone.  Partly due to fact it's on bottom of phone (terrible idea.)  But somehow my 2 1/2 year old Sony headphones survived just fine and are still working perfectly.  I had a Droid Razr Maxx for 2 years with no problems as well as Zune, Ipod's Razr 3, flip phones you name it never broke a headphone jack.Does not have hdmi port which Razr Maxx did have.  New android Kit Kat is also bad.  Removes back button and Menu button and gives you window button as replacement.  This is basically getting rid of two hardware buttons because you could use window function in previous android OS ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) by holding menu botton.  Hardware buttons actually are not standalone buttons but in screen.  This sometimes results in accidently hitting menu button while playing games.  Although it does go to full screen view in videos and pictures as well as certain games and apps which is nice.Processing speed is good as advertised and battery will last all day. But i am more experienced in monitoring apps opposed to average user.  I had to go change every app individually to not allow notifications (time consuming!.) This includes every single app on phone.  Apps like calculator, because that uses notifications right?Lock screen will factory restore your lock screen if guessed wrong 10 times.  That's right delete everything if someone grabs your phone and decides to mess with it and you have no option to turn this off.  There are no 3rd party apps that work either because home button will override 3rd party apps.  Had to install backup app and allow them to access my information and put on a \"secure\" cloud.Sound is ok, but would still much rather plug into speakers, oh yeah I can't now because my headphone jack doesn't work..Last of all customer service at HTC is terrible.

When the latter phone died, I chose to part ways with slider keyboards forever and bought the HTC One M8. I was skeptical about having to use an on-screen keyboard, but it turns out that the larger screen real estate and the coming-of-age of smart predictive keyboard apps like Swiftkey made all the difference.I'll give you the short rundown of why I like my HTC One so much, as well as try to correct some misinformation I've been reading on the popular tech review sites. To be honest, I've read the first 30 reviews on Amazon and can well recommend that you read them, too. Some of those reviewers did a great job, spending a lot of time to cover all the details. So for my part, I just want to emphasize the major points.------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 1: The High PointsThe best points I took away after using this phone for several weeks are tempered by the fact that I never used any of its competitors, like the Samsung Galaxy S4 or S5. My previous phone was an antiquated Droid 4. So you're going to see me frequently give the nod to the major press reviewers, just so you know I'm not the only one observing these things, such as [IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER]:1) Good 3G/4G reception and outstanding wifi performance. My HTC One easily matches or exceeds the reception coverage of my old Droid 4 (my wife also has a Droid 4 so my comparison is based on her phone's performance). I read some reviews stating the HTC was generally superior. But then I read a few reviews criticizing HTC for call reception. It's possible that some configurations of holding/positioning the phone and/or using bluetooth may be interfering with those persons' reception. But to further seal the deal, my wifi performance is absolutely sick. My iPad used to be the wifi king at our house, regularly clocking up to 20mbps download speed. In repeated speedtest trials, my HTC One now outperforms it by about 25%.2) Beautiful screen color rendition. I hate the false candy colors you get with the AMOLED displays. I like to see my photographs with at least some kind of realistic grayscale. While I wish the HTC One's display were a little brighter in sunlight, I am very pleased overall with how beautifully it renders my photos. The 5\" display is very easy on the eyes.3) Fast, responsive OS. Sense 6 + Kit Kat is better than Kit Kat. Don't pay any heed to the weenies who have fixated on the most trivial differences between Sense and stock Android, like how the app list scrolls vertically (the horror) instead of horizontally (oh, the horror). Sense is more than good enough to compare with pure Android--many of its unique features save time and make intuitive Sense (see what I did, there?). Like other reviewers, I love the swipe gestures to turn the phone on or go instantly into voice call mode. But mostly, I am blown away by how fast this phone responds to my gestures, how fast it scrolls, how quickly it opens an app, etc. The major reviewers concur that this phone has better response than either the Galaxy S5 or the iPhone 5s. Better than the iPhone. Huh.4) Superior sound quality. First it was the speakers. Awesome playback--louder than my iPad 2! Then I read somewhere that the internals from DAC to preamp were high quality. So I loaded-up a bunch of my CD quality .wav files--these are audiophile recordings, like LA 4's Just Friends, or Salamander Pie by Jay Leonhart. Then I plugged my Grado sr60 headphones in, and started listening. Then I went back to my Droid 4 and did the same. Wow. In comparison, my Droid 4 through headphones sounds like a mono radio! My HTC One sounds like separate, focused sources, spatially rendered, with deep, tightly controlled bass, easy on the ears, big dynamics... in other words, all the stuff that says you are approaching audiophile quality playback. Music is fun and exciting again!5) Metal. More precisely, aluminum. You need me to say more? Just go pick one up, already, and you'll understand what everyone's talking about.------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 2: The (theoretical) Low PointsFirst off, let me just say that if this phone had any seriously negative points, I could list them here with a clean conscience. But I don't perceive any deal-breakers. So instead, I'm going to respond to the gripes I've seen on the popular tech sites and from misc. reviewers [IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER]:1) 4 megapixel camera. It generally takes good photos, but you can't blow them up to a full monitor screen. In low light, this phone excels. In bright sunlight, you'll get blown highlights. When I go photo shooting, I prefer to use a real camera. No phone will do justice. Having said that, it's too bad HTC didn't follow the trend of other phones and put a better camera in. I personally am happy they chose to at least give you superior performance in dingy bars, where you're not likely to be carrying a separate camera.2) Big bezel. Specifically, the black bar that says \"HTC\". Some people actually thought HTC did that just to have their branding be prominent. It interferes with some aficionados' practiced one-handed swipesmanship. On account of the phone being too tall. For the little paws. To box with God. Look, weenies, HTC says they needed the room for circuitry, antennas, speakers, whatever. Get over it!3) Slippery metal body. There is truth to this. When I first held my brand spankin' new HTC One M8, I was seriously concerned that I might drop it. Then I quickly adapted my grip and it's no big deal. But here's what you need to know: be careful to protect your phone from inquiring guests. I let a friend examine my phone. And was shocked to see her blithely do the one-handed master swiper expert thang and watched the phone squirt out of her hand like a banana. Fortunately, it landed in her lap. You have been warned.------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 3: Correcting the False PointsWhich brings us to a few remaining misconceptions I would like to correct:1) Ufocus. Does NOT bring selected unfocused objects into focus after the picture has already been taken. Do not compare this to Lytro. It DOES blur the scene around selected objects, and not always pleasantly. Gimmick.2) Battery life is... wait for it... OK. Not bad, not great. Gosh. You'll generally get one full day.3) Screen is barely readable in sunlight. Who are all these people praising its brightness in sunlight? Get real! Still, most phones do poorly in this area. ***** ADDENDUM ***** I just read on an Android forum that HTC is not turning out identically spec'd displays. They may be using different manufacturers, because some phones have polarized glass, while others don't (mine doesn't). Also, within the same manufacturing run, people are noting significant differences in contrast and brightness. Too bad HTC didn't implement better quality control to assure consistency.4) Gorilla glass is not made of hyper-compressed banana skins.

Feels like a piece of fine jewelry in your hand -- flawless aluminum construction. Screen has a way better color palette than the GS4, and I actually really like the Sense 6 skin compared to TouchWiz. It feels closer to stock Android with less bloatware, and BlinkFeed seems cool so far.HTC seems to have taken the core great features from the first model and beefed up the performance, and it is a FAST phone.The camera's 360 panorama feature is awesome, and the speakers sound fantastic.Call reception is good, and have gotten about 5 hours of battery life from the initial 60 percent charge out of the box (plugged in at 25% remaining).Highly recommend this phone!", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best Android phone currently available!", "Author": "Mia Chong", "ReviewID": "R35ULQOQ685MVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hardware:The design of this gadget is striking and gorgeous. Boasting a metal, slightly reflective sheen, this phone dazzles beneath the light. The display is even more brilliant. Despite the annoying inclusion of a wide bezel bearing the HTC logo on the bottom, the 5-inch 1080p LCD display is rich and vibrant. Forgoing any hardware buttons, the back, home, and multi-tasking buttons are now on-screen software keys.The front-facing boom-sound speakers are ridiculously loud and full, producing sound that bests my 11-inch Macbook Air if you can believe that. HTC claims the speakers are 25% louder than last year's One, and I believe it. This model includes support for micro-SD card expansion, which is always appreciated. Be aware that you will need to use a paperclip or sim-removal tool to access the port.The only problem is the slightly slippery-feel of the back and the awkward positioning of the power-button on top; but otherwise the design and form of this phone is near-flawless. You'll never want to put a case on this phone, as this beauty deserves to be admired.Software:Sense 6 is surprisingly classy and functional-- it is most definitely not stock Android, but it's miles ahead of anything Samsung or LG is putting out with their software overlays. The speed of this phone is unbelievably smooth and zippy; it's quite difficult to induce stuttering or lag while using this beast. I've had some experience with the Galaxy Note 3, and the HTC One M8 is quite a bit faster. The ability to choose from a few choices for the color theme of the UI is very cool, albeit a bit limited in options. There's a lot of HTC and Verizon bloatware pre-loaded, but luckily you can disable most of these apps.My favorite software features are, surprisingly enough, the motion launch gestures. These gestures allow you to turn on the phone by double-tapping the screen, launch BlinkFeed by swiping right, go straight to the widget panel by swiping left, skip the lock-screen by swiping up, and launching voice-commands by swiping down. The only quirk is that those gestures can only be used when the phone is in portrait-mode, meaning you can't use any of those gestures while the phone is flat on it's back when on a table; you first need to pick the phone up. Regardless, these gestures are appreciated due to the awkward positioning of the power-button on top of this tall phone. My favorite gesture is being able to hold the phone in landscape position and pressing the volume button to launch the camera. Every phone should have this feature!Camera:Speaking of the camera, how is it? It's average. The front-facing camera is 5 megapixels while the main duo cameras on the back are stunningly only 4 megapixels. The twin cameras on the back allow for refocusing of an image AFTER it has already been taken. This effect can be strikingly brilliant at times, and weirdly artificial the next. Low-light photos are very effective, but everything else is middle-of-the-road. You'll find noise and muddled detail frequently; and no refocusing gimmick can assuage those shortcomings.Battery:The battery is 2,600mAh lithium-polymer battery that gives decent, but not astounding performance. My first few days with the phone required a charge by the time evening came along, due to extremely heavy use. As my usage leveled out to a more typical, moderate day of usage, I was able to get through a whole day no problem.Conclusion:Beautiful industrial design, fantastic media-playback, blazingly-fast performance. What does all that mean? The HTC One M8 is a brilliant example of how to do an Android phone right. Sadly, the camera is a true downer. It's acceptable for the occasional Facebook or Instagram post, but if you're a camera-enthusiast, this isn't the phone for you. But for everyone else, if you asked me to recommend an Android phone, my answer will always be the all new HTC One.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R2TE1GTCYM1Z9N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To start I have a few complaints, but they are mostly complaints about verizon. First. It took over 2 hours to activate my phone when it said five minutes. That is a gross underestimation and I'm not the only one who has had this problem. Second is the bloatware. I don't watch football so why would I want the NFL mobile app? At least give us the option to uninstall it. That storage space would be better spent empty. We know NFL is paying you to pre-install these sorts of apps. If you're going to do stuff like that, at least pass some savings on to the consumer. Rant overScreen: Smaller than my previous phone, the note 2, and I can definitely notice it, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. At least it's not as small as an iPhone. PPI is the highest I've seen on a device. I love the crisp images and text, but I miss the vibrant colors from my old amoled screen. Honestly, it makes the device feel more \"adult\" and less cartoony and i can get over it.Sound: By far the best feature. It just makes sense to have front facing speakers on a phone. The quality is the best I've heard from a mobile. call quality is good as well. nuff saidBattery: So far it's been going about a day and has about a third life left. It's what I would expect from a premium device. Though the lack of a removable battery is a bit of a turn-off.Build quality: I've wanted a metal device for a long time. I'm disappointed samsung hasn't done something like this yet. Non-removable covers do make for a better looking device. It's a tradeoff that some will welcome and some will hate. It makes the build quality more on par with an apple device and I'm okay with it. The one actually reminds of an iphone in a lot of ways. If you removed the htc logo and slapped an apple sticker on it, a lot of people would probably think it was a new iphone. Only smartphone geeks would think otherwise.Camera: Great in low light, haven't done any outdoor testing. But it won't be replacing my dslr anytime soon. Smartphone cameras have never been a big selling point to me. It's a convenience and that's about it. I took maybe 100 or less pictures in the 2 years I owned my last phone. I'm not a \"selfie\" person either, so the front facing camera will never be used. Personally I would rather see front facing cameras go away.Operating System. Kit kat is the newest version as of this posting. A welcome feature for me is the ability to double tap the screen to wake. Especially since the unlock button is on the top of the screen. Which I HATE. I prefer it to be on the side of the phone. I hope kit kat sticks around for a while, because it seems like every time they do an update they make the phone slower. There's no reason a phone with a quad core and 2 gigs of ram should EVER lag. The system specs are comparable to my note 2 and yet my note 2 after 2 years was god awfully slow even after a factory reset. The only other feature I appreciate is that if you get a call from an unrecognized number, the phone will search the number for a match in the background. If there is a match it will show the name or business on the caller id. I got a call from the dentist office this morning and it wasn't in my phone so it searched it and found a match. All the other features are gimmicks. Having an IR blaster is just silly. Unless you lose your tv remote this will largely go unused by 90 percent of consumers. Most won't even realize it has an IR blaster.Sense UI: Seem less bloated than samsung's UI, which is welcome. It's better than my first htc phone (the eris) from 4 or 5 years ago. I like simplicity. Software buttons are okay, but I still prefer physical buttons. I can get over this.Other thoughts: I like how much faster the wifi is. I have a 105 mbps connection at home. My note 2 could barely hit 20 on the wifi. The one gets to about 75-85. I was having some connectivity issues with it while chromecasting. I couldn't seem to get youtube videos to play while I was watching some google play tv shows on the tv. Hopefully this will be resolved. Another feature I would like is the ability to make tv show playlists in the same way you can have a youtube que for chrome cast. I like to sleep with the TV on as it helps me get to sleep. I often wake up in the first few hours if the tv sound turns off and have to set another show to play.Conclusion: I like it more than any of the other options out there. I don't want an iphone because the screen is too small and samsung hasn't really done anything impressive other than a higher megapixel camera. I almost wanted to get the note 3 but i felt like the only reason I wanted it was for the 1080p screen. And its been out since last fall and will probably get an update soon. By far the selling points of this phone for me was the aluminum body, the speakers, and the high PPI screen. It's probably the best android phone you can buy for the next few months and will still be relevant for the rest of the year.

Sanchez", "ReviewID": "R2CZY36TF7WIH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll keep this short. I was offered the opportunity to upgrade my device via the Edge program.  I had the galaxy s4 and still had a year remaining on my contract so I figured why not take the chance on the M8, camera be damned.  As soon as I got the phone I felt a pang of guilt for surrendering my S4,  I mean the S4 was a great, speedy and such a light- weight phone that snapped vivid photos,  and I felt a sense of loyalty to the brand.  However a week later with this device I can actually say that it was gamble that truly paid off.  Other than the obvious metal design, this phone makes a lot of sense: headset jacks at the bottom of the phone,  loud front-facing speakers,  32gb of internal storage, the ability to waken the phone by tapping on the screen (though trying to compensate for placing the power button on top of the phone), and lastly HTC refused to spam the phone with useless gimmicks. In terms of the camera,  the phones Achilles  heel, I've managed to capture great-looking photos.  I can't complain nor have any regrets.  People complaining about the camera on this phone and other insignificant details remind me of my coworker who complains that when he gets home from work all he looks forward to is cracking open a beer and play video games but all his wife ever wants to do is have sex.

It ignored criticism from many about its 4MP camera on its old model.  It kept 4MP camera and removed OIS. It went with complicated duo camera, which is mainly used for bokeh effect. I think higher megapixel with OIS is more important than bokeh effect. I understand higher megapixel does not mean high quality, but 4MP is just not enough. Minimum has to be 8MP. I would be happy if HTC just put whatever is used on Lumia 925/928(8MP + OIS).2. It went with soft buttons. That's OK, but what the hell is the HTC black bar under the soft button area. M8 display is increased to 5\" from 4.7\", but overall usable space on the screen  for the contents is same as its old model.
