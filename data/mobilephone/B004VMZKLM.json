{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This phone will last you forever :D", "Author": "rhaney", "ReviewID": "RS28B5WZL7AVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Rumor touch for two years now, and I haven't had one issue. I only changed phones once because I was due for an upgrade, but I changed back because I like this one way more than any smart phone. There's no apps, so that's the only downfall but you still have a facebook option on the menu that has a pretty good interface along with the rest of the phone. It has some other options too like twitter so that's cool. If you're tired of needing a new phone every six months like I was then I definitely recommend this phone. The keyboard is easy to get used to, and the touch screen is easy to text on and use to. There's nothing that I don't like about it.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This product has been carefully audited and is certified to be 100% functional.\nThis offer includes the following accessories 1.
