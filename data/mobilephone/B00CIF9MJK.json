{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome phone, incremental upgrade from SIII", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R282P6RDBBLS7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Galaxy S4 is  an incredible phone. I have been using this unlocked S4 for past 2 days helping a friend to migrate from iPhone 4S. My friend has been on iPhone and it also gave me a unique perspective. I used iPhone for couple of years and been using Android for past 3+ years.I have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4.

Here's what I like about the phone:Beautiful screen - for those of us who don't have perfect vision, this screen is very readable. The fonts are an appropriate size, with good contrast.Nice speed. The screen is responsive, and allows multiple windows to be open at once.Screen size:  For certain apps, I.e. the kindle app, this screen approximates an e-reader very well (as opposed to reading on a smaller phone screen.)The interface is very thoughtfully designed.  Great job, Samsung!  Unobtrusive, noninvasive methods of accessing critical apps are available from almost anyplace on the phone.Icons/graphics are adorable, and creatively designed.  No boring manila folders on this phone!  Your folders show contents from the outside of the folder... Cute.Ease of use:  There is a little bit of a learning curve on this phone (I had the Samsung Epic previously), but I've pretty much figured it out in a few hours.  It's going to be great. Once you get the hang of the graphics, it's really quick to move things around, personalize, etc.It really blurs the boundary between a tablet and a phone, without becoming too huge, like the Note (which I am now glad I did not buy).Voice quality: I'd read reviews in the last few days that state that it is not very good... I think it's fine. The sound is clear, and volume is fine.One of my favorite apps for Android:  Out of Milk.  Running out of groceries?  Scan the bar code into one of your shopping lists, (or input by voice or typing), and your shopping list is complete.  I keep a running shopping list for Trader Joes, and my other local market.  When I go to the store, I simply move the items I need to the top of the list, and go for it!  No more paper lists!One heads up: (carrier, not phone related):  check on Visual Voicemail.... I use it all the time, and really like it.  I was surprised to discover that I had to pay for it as an add on with Verizon.... It was part of my Sprint service previously.** UPDATE **I've had the phone for almost a week, and it's simply a PLEASURE to use!  Lots of nice touches:  pop up asking if you'd like to add someone to your contacts after a call from a non contact, for example.Camera:  is great.  I photographed an entire exhibit in a museum.... No flash, in dark rooms, and the photos are stunning.Battery life:  surprisingly good!  I used the phone all day yesterday, on and off trains where it would have been seeking service in tunnels (usually drains battery quicker), used my Kindle app, made calls, sent texts and emails, and I still had 60% at the end of a ten hour day.Battery recharging:  using the charging cord that comes with the phone, it charges in no time... A couple of hours at most.  I've been amazed at the recharge speed, compared to my previous phone.Kindle app is like a baby Kindle... there's just enough on the page to not feel like you are only reading a few sentences at a time like on some smaller devices.I'm so pleased with my choice,  I hope you enjoy it, also.(And in case this is helpful to anyone:  if you are debating about a case, I have the Seidio holster case... Please see my review.)*************Enjoy this great device!  Questions?

At first I was a bit hesitant with the phone: holding it felt a little awkward (I'm used to the Motorola Atrix 2 which is smaller and quite a bit more bulky) being bigger than I'm used and much much thinner and lightweight.  Honestly, I was afraid I would drop it!  After getting an Otterbox Defender Case for it (if you haven't had an Otterbox try it, you won't get another case) the size is now perfect and the case really makes it easier to hold and grip.  Like any other phone, your going to find a bunch of apps you don't want but can't get rid of unless you jailbreak the phone which is an annoyance but nothing to fret for along time about.  As far as performance goes, the phone runs very smoothly and very rarely \"lags\" which is a plus because I have very little patience when it comes to technology :D.  If you need more space for music, pictures, or movies, there is a MicroSD expansion slot.  Being an avid camera user, I was also impressed with both the video quality and the photo quality with this phone.  With the camera you have several different \"modes\" to set it on such as Night, Auto, Sports, Panorama, etc.  This phone does also have allot of cool features which I'm not particularly interested in like a setting that will pause a video when you look away and \"air gestures\" which will allow you do some things without actually touching your phone screen.  The one I saw that looked very useful was a setting that increases sensitivity so you can still use your phone with gloves on.  Overall it is the best Android phone I have ever had and I have absolutely no complaints (except for those annoying apps you can't get rid of)!

They only allow you a 30 day return policy and that is stated no where prior to the purchase from the seller. One day after my 30 day probationary period was up the phone began to behave erratic. The charging port had issues, the phone had to be charged twice or thrice for the day and I am not running a whole lot of apps and to top it up I got this message during charging: 'charging paused, battery temperature to high\". I have replaced the battery, the charger and have done a factory reset all to no avail. The seller refuses to allow me to return the product for another one or at least offer any form of compensation in part or in full after such a huge investment. This behave is definitely unacceptable and I am alerting everyone to stay away from this seller until full disclosure is made on the terms and conditions of purchase prior to the actual purchase.

It finally occurred to me to buy one great phone and just switch sim cards.  This phone was recommended to me by someone who traveled all over Italy using it's GPS, and was raving about it.  So I bought one in time for my forthcoming trip, also to Italy.Got to Pisa, bought a sim card for 19 Euros, and used the phone constantly for the rest of the trip.  Great coverage, even in the most remote parts of the country (the provider was \"3\").  The GPS was a total lifesaver, and the camera is pretty great on it too. The only reason I gave this phone  four stars instead of five is that I don't love the OS.  As much as I'd love to switch to this phone full time, I'm much more comfortable with the Apple OS.

The only way this could get better is if Google incorporates Android jellybean with Chrome OS vanilla versatility. That's why I like Android, and Google over Microsoft. Google runs like a race horse, whereas Microsoft runs like a snail. And don't believe those stupid \"scroogled\" adds from Microsoft. Speed wise, Google is actually better than Apple.
