Meanwhile their website says there's still 2 more units available at that time. I was told via email by Dave from HassleFreeCell to call Amazon to undo the refund.Nov 30 - Confusing emails offering solutions poured in \"IN  1 DAY\" from Amazon, not to add HassleFreeCell's.Dec 1 -  Per confusing responses from Amazon & Dave to \"re-order\" after the refund, I finally did under HassleFreeCell's website, BUT WAS REROUTED INSTEAD TO VALUEPACKS (Seller). After trying several times to get back on Hasslfreecell's website, I thought \"maybe\" Amazon was trying to \"help\" make my re-ordering problem free by re-routing my order to Valuepacks. Seems like Valuepacks has better reviews anyway & I'm under time pressure to have the same delivered. So I went ahead & finalize my order, regardless who the Seller is. I had full faith with the Amazon company anyway as \"I never had encountered any major problem, until later.\"Dec 3 - iPhone unit FINALLY delivered & received, courtesy of VALUEPACKS.Dec 10 - I received an email from HassleFreeCell offering compensation for $40 and requesting to have my negative feedback removed. Good comeback but with all the BS that I'm going thru with this issue, I'm not buying it.From Nov 30 to present, I've been emailing Amazon back & forth. I keep getting the answer that the refund has already been made. YES IT IS AND THAT WAS THE \"FIRST\" ORDER. THE SECOND RE-ORDER IS BEING ASSOCIATED TO THE FIRST REFUND. Simple as it is to me, too complicated I guess for Amazon?Not to mention the over limit fees made on my account on this issue. It doesn't help either that I'm addressing this growing frustration from another part of the world. Amazon has great customer service but everybody's on different page in offering solutions.Being in the customer service industry myself, Hasslefreecell should have prevented this problem have they shipped a replacement instead of refunding, and notifying the customer thru email after the fact. Then cramming after to offer compensation and re-delivery. It doesn't serve its purpose. \"PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE\". Amazon, great as they are with customer service, should REVIEW histories of customer inquiries before offering solutions as they add more frustration to the issues. Had I not write the investigative department of Amazon, the 2nd charges wouldn't have been taken off from my account. That doesn't even include the over limit fees & interest charges. Too much hassle made by Hasslefreecell.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent product and excellent service!", "Author": "Z. Abussaud", "ReviewID": "R8FFI6O0JIJOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my iPhone 4S 64GB from Amazon.com and had it ship-forwarded to my country. Unfortunately, the mobile operators in my country do not support FaceTime and sell a local iPhone 4S version without the application; some local retailers sell iPhone 4S with FaceTime and charge significantly high, but I managed to save money by purchasing it from Amazon.com plus the ship-forwarding. Even if the mobile operator does not support FaceTime, I can still use it with Apple ID and free of charge through Wi-Fi. I am also very pleased with WorldWide Distributors since they shipped the phone free within one day and delivered it to my US address in four days. The only one issue I had is that the box was previously opened and someone went through the initial setup, but it was probably the ship-forwarding agent. I had my old iPhone 3GS easily backed up to iTunes and restored to my new iPhone 4S, and I started using my new phone in no time.
