{"Reviews": [{"Title": "You get what you pay for...", "Author": "esanta \"esanta\"", "ReviewID": "R3FRNFERXBGEX9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "An unlocked GSM Android phone with dual cameras, GPS, WiFi, bluetooth, 3G, microSD card slot, capacitive touch screen... at this price? There must be a catch, right? Well, yeah, there is.First, the good. The BLU D230 looks and feels really nice, with rounded edges everywhere, like a soft pebble. It slips easily into a pocket, feels good in hand, the screen quality is fairly decent and the digitizer tracks well.The cameras are adequate, although they pale in comparison with what you find on current phones.BLU installs Google's Android with no modifications, so you don't have to deal with the usual crapware that is a nightmare to uninstall.Performance is perfectly adequate for a phone, we're not in Tegra 3 land here.Battery life is really excellent. I would expect being able to go through a day or two on a full charge, and possibly up to a week on stand-by.The dual-SIM is a feature we rarely see in the US, and it's useful for the traveler; unfortunately, 3G is only supported on SIM1.Now, the bad... To begin with, this phone does not even show up on BLU's web site. After contacting them by email, they did confirm that it was a current phone and that it had no upgrade path to Android 2.3.Unfortunately, that means limited Skype support. Skype's web site states that front facing cameras won't work on Android 2.2 for some technical reason. BLU's tech support said neither camera works with Skype and suggested using Tango for videoconferencing.Inserting a SIM or a microSD card requires removing the battery. The back cover comes off easily, although it does look fairly fragile. You may keep the phone running as long as you keep it plugged into a power outlet. The SIM and microSD insertion and removal procedure is not detailed in the manual, and it's very frustrating. You need to slide the metal holder for the microSD, but the SIM cards slide in (requires a little bending of the SIM card). The SIM connectors make using a microSIM difficult.The biggest problem I had with the D230 was that despite the 32GB microSD card I fed it, installing more than a handful of programs became an exercise in frustration, because the installer would complain that I had ran out of space, even though I had moved practically all my apps to the SD card. I seem to remember there may have been a problem with Android 2.2, probably compounded with the fact that some resource (onboard RAM or some flash partition) is underdimensioned. I don't really care about doing the troubleshooting for BLU, I just want a phone that works and that I can install apps on!Another major problem that will probably make most Android fans stay away from this phone: it's an unusual model and there is little to no support on the usual forums, which negates the biggest benefit of having an Android phone: the ability to tweak and install custom ROMs, and upgrade the OS even when the manufacturer does not support it. No Cyanogenmod for the D230!The GPS tracks poorly; it wasn't able to get a fix in some indoor locations where other phones (iPhone 4, Galaxy SII) had no trouble.Finally, this being such an uncommon phone, forget about finding the cases and accessories you can find for most widely distributed phones at any mall kiosk or on Amazon.In conclusion... unless you desperately need the dual SIM feature, the OS limitations and lack of upgrade path make it a phone that can't be recommended, even at its low price.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "Javier Antonio Pardo Ocampo", "ReviewID": "R3DZ49737UH5XY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This cell phone is great, easy to use and a big tool for my work 'cause i'm  always conected in anywhere.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "getting your money worth", "Author": "Raymond Jones", "ReviewID": "R2WD6L8931RLKF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this cell was every thing as it was said to do and work, it has been working so well that i will be getting another one soon", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "realy cool", "Author": "te", "ReviewID": "R2UIZBMKU0RZR1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it is realy good dual sim phone for this price. android works great, media player is great, and the voice in earphones is quiet good. i did not expect such good phone for this price. i advice everyone who did not need fancy phones. its screen is great, it is the same size you can see on the picture.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone", "Author": "rick parkinson", "ReviewID": "R2HCH22HCTFO3V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a nice phone, I enjoyed it while I used it.

The android app makes it work like a computer where i can download and install games and other software. It can facilitate more than 16g sd card. It has 4g technology and the price is not expensive.I have 2 problems with this phone though.1) The battery has to be charged everyday2) The system memory keeps filling up minimizing the amount of space you have to download stuff and even after uninstalling files the system memory does not reduce.If these problems, especially number two, can be fixed i would give this phone a 5 star rating.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good choice for a dual sim android phone", "Author": "P.
