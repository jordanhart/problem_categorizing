Great battery life and  tons of features like its 2.0Mgpx camera that is the closest thing to \"real\" that I have seen on a phone. Great user interface with a wide assortment of settings, mp3 music player, and overall design are just wonderful.I should mention that reception on K750 is much better then on older SonyEricsson handsets. It now works in places where my old T610 struggled for signal or had no reception at all. The only thing that was bothering me at the beggining was a bit low audio quality during calls, but it was fixed after update I downloaded from SonyEricsson's website.At this time, it is one of the best phones available on the market, and there is a lot of good phones out there...", "Date": "August 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "The perfect phone for those looking for an all-in-one package", "Author": "Mario G. Estacio", "ReviewID": "R2O4TFAKS0IBWD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic phone for users who are looking for an all-in-one package, as it can be used as a triband phone, a basic organizer, an mp3 player, a camera and a recorder all in one. It has a very attractive design and will draw plenty of comments.In more detail:1. Triband phoneYou can travel virtually anywhere in the world and still use this phone as it is triband. It has a good speaker which can be used while driving to minimize distractions. The keypad, while a bit small, is very tactile. Battery life is very long, I've waited up to four days before having to fully recharge it.2. Organizer/personal schedulerYou can sync it with Microsoft Outlook to get your Contact list and your Calendar appointments. It has the best phone organizer that I've yet seen on a mobile phone.3. mp3 playerThe mp3 player is excellent considering that it's not the primary function of the handpiece. The only criticisms of the mp3 player are that you can only use proprietary SE earphones with it and that it is inconvenient to scroll through songs once the phone's keylock activates. Obviously you can't use it on the plane!4. 2megapixel cameraThis has the best camera I've seen on a mobile phone. Pictures are clear and large. It's obviously not camera aficionado quality, but perfect for those casual snaps that you may want to make, and the pictures turn out fine either uploaded to an online album or printed in regular size. It also takes video in .3gp format. The photos/video/mp3s are stored in the Sony Memory Stick Pro Duo which comes in sizes from 64MB all the way to 1GB.5. Voice recorderIt has a great quality voice recorder which can be used to record meetings or lectures.All in all a fantastic phone. I really can't find anything wrong with it.", "Date": "December 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "For those who want it all...", "Author": "Carlo San Juan \"Caz MD\"", "ReviewID": "RWIRONKW8AF45", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony Ericsson put out all the stops for this one.  If you're looking for a sleek-looking candy bar-style GSM phone that's tri-band and has a built-in 2.0 Megapixel digital camera, mp3 player, video clip recorder, sound recorder, web browser, FM radio, handheld videogame console with 3D capabilities, fully enabled bluetooth and infrared port, AND a handy light, then this is the phone for you!The phone looks great if it matters to you.  Once again Sony Ericsson made a dual-faced machine, one side a phone and on the other a digital camera (with a sliding lens cover).  The display is brilliant with few problems under sunlight.  Images are crisp onscreen and animated wallpapers run smoothly.Speaking of graphics, to say that this phone has animated menus is an understatement.  Everything can be in motion here, even the highlight bar.  Best of all, it all runs seamlessly.Pictures taken with the camera are at par with lower-scale 2.0 Megapixel digital cameras.  If taken in the dark, pictures still have a decent quality.  Yes, there's a night-mode.  There's even a light to help.  There's even a digital zoom.Mp3 and wav files sound great with the included headphones/handsfree unit.  But you can play music using the built-in speaker which isn't much but it gets the job done.  The phone can play mp4 and g3p video formats from both the Memory Stick and internal memory (same with audio files).  The phone also supports the classic .mid format.There are a few gripes.  First of all, there is no search feature in the contacts area.  You can only search as far as the first letter of the name you're looking for then it's down to scrolling to the proper contact.  Second is the awkward \"2\" key which makes dialing and typing messages a bit difficult.  Furthermore, the plastic door that covers the Memory Stick port is a bit difficult to open.However, all in all this is a truly solid non-smartphone package.", "Date": "February 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Camera? Phone?", "Author": "David Glumac", "ReviewID": "R39JWNTJC70KP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Silver and Black versions both exist, and I must say that I am partial to the silver one - it simply looks more professional.I'd recommend this phone to most people - with deep enough pockets - but most especially to the frequent traveller / businessman. It will play your MP3's (not that we businessmen listen to that!), take astounding pictures (for a phone that is), do reasonably good video clips and you'll actually be able to call someone.Also worthy of not are:1) The 2 LEDs that are a \"flash\", but which double as a strong flashlight/SOS beacon2) Integrated radio - trafic information on the go!and, very importantly:3) An integrated application called \"remote control\" enables you to control a presentation, media player or the actuall mouse from your phone! The computer you're using it on will need Bluetooth tho, but this function is astoundingly usefull if you're doing a presentation.", "Date": "September 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "The joy of the joystick", "Author": "Amanda Richards", "ReviewID": "R2N0OFSSHZODZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's that time of the year when I get a new cell phone, just because I'm a year older, or Christmas is coming, or both, or whatever. Having had good experiences with Sony Ericsson, I kinda hinted strongly in that direction, and must say that I'm pleasantly surprised by this model.My last phone was a Sony Ericsson Z520a, which I was quite happy with, and I had to mentally take myself out of the flip phone groove and into the candybar style of the K750i. This phone is superior to the Z520a as far as sound, camera and features go, but I still think the flip phone is cooler looking.  I almost got the W300i, which is an upgrade to the Z520a, but fortunately I got a chance to see one in real life, and realized that pictures on-line aren't always all they appear to be.(Note: The W300i feels cheap and plasticky, and that orange button on the side is unsightly to say the least.  The keys are these overlapping circles that are also less than aesthetically pleasing)Anyway, the pros and cons of the K750i as observed so far are:Pros1. Big displays, nice weight, sleek appearance2. Dual front design with phone on one side and camera at the \"other\" front, so it's easy to choose which side is up when you need to take a picture.  It has a reflecting disc for self portraits.3. The digital camera is a 2 mega pixel gizmo that looks like the real thing, with a sliding window to protect the lens and everything. It can auto focus and zoom and can take pictures in a variety of settings, including night and panorama, and do lots of other things like macros and videos that I need to read up before attempting.4. The central joystick button needs just your thumb to operate it, and makes it easy to scroll through the multiple screens once you get the hang of it.5. It's a radio and MP3 media player with amazing clarity of sound, and comes with its own earphones. It's got equalizers and stuff too, and sounds great through the earphones.6. It comes with the cables to upload or download files from the computer, as well as Bluetooth technology which I've actually used once successfully.7. Battery life seems fine so far8. Internet services included where available9. Games included10. It even has a light function, plus all the usual stuff likes alarms and ringtones, silent modes and speed dialing, voice commands and all the other things that I haven't yet memorized from the manual.Cons:1. When you put on the keylock function, it locks itself after a few seconds, so you need to be really quick with your fingers to beat the clock. I can't seem to find any feature to lengthen this time.2. The \"2\" button can be difficult to press if your fingers are not slim and tapered.3. The power button is hard to press for larger fingers4. The joystick need some getting used to, and at first I kept pushing the button instead of moving it left and right and up and down5. Searching for contacts isn't easy, requiring a lot of scrolling with the joystick6. The pictures look grainy when enlarged, but this may be due to my not using the right resolution or setting rather than a design flaw. (I'll research this more later)7. I'm terrified of dropping it or getting it drizzled on8. With the key lock feature on, the numbers don't light up unless the phone is unlocked, and I have been having problems trying to locate the unlock buttons in the dark.Summary: A really nice phone, appearance and feature wise, even if you only use it to send and receive calls.

This is a big problem specially inside buildings where the 850 band works best.I bought this phone to use with my Cingular service and it's been disastrous because for Cingular 1900 is the \"back up\" frequency.  Most of the time my phone won't work.  Specially inside my house.  I can't dial out or get calls.  Sometimes callers can't even get to my voicemail.  I believe on T-mobile the service would be better since they have better 1900 coverage but I don't know that for a fact.Other than that I do echo most of the possitive reviews about the great features etc.  It's not quiet an iPod because the interface is not as good (can't FF or RW songs for example, you have to ceate playlists in order to hear more than one song at a time).  Also it's not as loud as an iPod which is a problem on an airplane.The camera is great and you can get a flash for it but the light that comes standard is actually good enough for close up pictures in dark places.", "Date": "August 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best Phone ever", "Author": "Rich Sanfilippo", "ReviewID": "R2550JP5GRPJOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, best phone I'VE ever had (and I had a lot, starting with the original Star-Tacs).

Additionally it has other useful features such as calculator, stopwatch, timer and calendar which are all handy to have.Only bad point I have managed to find is the 2 button doesn't always respond straight away, taking a couple of pushes to get it to work!

And yes, it has it all, great camera, mp3 player, games console, 3d capabilities, it is triband, etc etc etc. However, no one has mentioned it has an internal memory of 32mb. Copying from the camera memory to the memomry card only takes a few seconds. It also has music, photo and video editing software inside the phone. You can also send the photos, videos and voice recordings you take via SMS if you have that service available with your carrier. The joystick is also great for playing games while you are on the bus, subway waiting and doing nothing else. The camera is not that great in dark places even with night mode and the little light on, but you can buy a flash add-on.My only complain with the phone is that after one year of use, the joystick is a bit unresponsive, and dust has collected below the screen. It's probably a maintainance thing, but still, I wish I didn't have to bring it to SE for them to fix it.All in all, a really nice phone, I won't be changing it for at least another year.", "Date": "April 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Lack of 850 Band -- US Residents Should Avoid This Phone", "Author": "H.

In a country filled with phones that have mediocre VGA cameras, this phone has definately been a standout.Unfortunately, the joystick has degenerated into sheer torture to use, and I feel like I'm trying to row a canoe with my pinkie every time I attempt to make the joystick respond.  There is also a bit of a lag time, when attempting to scroll through various photos in the photo album--an issue that has clearly been addressed in the W810i which is nice.And finally, DO NOT get this phone if you're on Cingular in NYC.  Even in the city, with supposedly good 1900 Mhz there are ridiculous areas where one does not have reception, where one really should have it (ie in tall buildings close to a window, or  near a door in a building).  oddly enough, such reception dead zones magically come alive with a Tmobile sim card, since Tmo's network still runs primarily on the 1900 Mhz band.", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sweet and fun cell phone!!!", "Author": "A.

Phone, music player, camera, organizer, everything is in there and Sony Ericsson has got the formula down so it all works great. The digital camera is excellent, I used it as my main camera for the 10 or so months I owned it. The screen is gorgeous, it feels great in your hand and looks good too.As of now I believe this is the most popular camera phone that's actually used as a camera. It's a good one, 2.0 megapixels is not incredible but honestly I almost never take anything more than causal snapshots. For serious photos I have a digital SLR I use. The photo LED light is good, but night shots are difficult. You can enable night mode but good luck eliminating blur. Still, if you can keep it stable and the subject is close enough the photos looks good. Regular flash can wash out a picture and give it a cold look but the LED light almost always made the photo look true. Also, this thing is bright-you can use it a flashlight and it's actually very effective. Just don't shine it in someone's eye. The autofocus is very good, you will only get frustrated with a complex scene or very close macro, but that's understandable with a low end camera. Most of the time it's dead on and you get a good sharp focus. One thing I will say, this is a low end camera in every sense. Don't bring this to the ballgame and expect great shots. Like I said it's great for causal shots because it's always with you, but 2 MP can get a bit grainy if you blow it up much, and in low light you may be disappointed at times.The phone itself is great. Like most Sony Ericssons it has a bit of a problem with the earpiece volume. You have to line it up just right with your ear and press a little. In a crowd it's quite hard to hear. Still the voice quality is good, and reception is good as well. The menu layout is simple and intuitive-there's a lot to customize and many menu items even have an Info option to tell you about it. It has most of the goodies that make a phone user-friendly: bluetooth, web browser, email, music and video player (with Memory Stick Pro duo support), PDA-like organizer, file browser, and Java. Java is especially nice because there are a ton of mobile Java apps out there that really beef up your phone (Opera mini is the best example-think of it as internet explorer for your phone but better). As a result this phone is very customizable. You can load it with tools, music, pictures, etc. and soon it's like your 2nd computer. The hardware is excellent, it's sturdy and solid and works even after a couple of drops. There is an issue I have with this phone, and it's the joystick. It's way more convenient than 4 buttons and more intuitive, but after moderate to heavy use it will start to lose functionality. This is a major pain, I almost took a star off but the phone excels so well in everything else; it really is a 5-star phone. Sony will repair this problem, but only if you have a valid receipt. I bought mine on ebay and so I was SOL.Keep in mind that this is not an American phone. It is European tri-band (900/1800/1900), so if you're on the Cingular network, which operates on the 850 band, the phone won't work. T-Mobile customers will be fine since they use the 1800 band. Be aware, though, that if you roam into a Cingular zone you will not get service.I will say one more thing, and that is that if you are considering buying this phone at this point in time, you will definitely want to consider the K790a. The K790a is the successor to the K750i, and it is better in just about every way. The hardware and software is all upgraded (3.2 MP camera now and real xenon flash!). Plus, it's a true American tri-band so you can roam the states with it. I bought one to replace my K750i and love it. The only reason not to buy it is because it is a tad bigger and heavier, and of course it is quite a bit more expensive right now.

I have been missing too many opportunities of snapping great pictures while I was out and about.  I am in Washington, DC so there are plenty of chances to take a picture of a celebrity or of an event.  I have used the music features of this phone and it is great when you listen with the included headphones.  However, the mp3 player is not why I bought this phone.The camera is good, but I have one quibble.  When taking a pix: you have to press the picture button key, then it has to focus, then the picture is actually taken (with delays between each step).  When dealing with still scenes and static objects, this is ok.  However, when taking shots of kids or animals you get pictures of blurry kids or moving objects. I wish SE would improve the speed of its auto-focus feature.First, I am using this phone in the US on the T-mobile network.  While I would like to give this phone a great review, I can't because it is lacking in two key areas:  reception and call volume.  When I compare this phone to the Moto v3, the SE gets lower bars and more static than the Moto.  This is what is referred to as the RF rating.  This was done using both the phones at the same time/place.  I'm not a fan of Moto's but in terms of price this phone roughly compares to the SE.  Also, since everyone is always dumping on Moto's, I was surprised that they were better in this key area.Another problem with the SE is the call volume.  I found that even when using the phone at its highest call volume, it is very hard to hear the other party.  You can hear when you are in an office, but mobile phones are for use outside. In sometimes-noisy areas, as well.  Think about when a loud truck passes you on the street and you are on your phone.  I found myself having to press really hard on my ear with this phone when this would happen.Another negative is the camera side/camera cover of the phone protrudes too much.  I wish SE had given it a flatter design.  Also, this cover is made of plastic, which doesn't feel too strong.  If the camera cover had been flat, the plastic wouldn't have mattered.  To give you an idea:  if you lay the phone on the camera side, you can spin it like a bottle, that's how round the cover is.Finally, I give great marks to SE for their user interface navigation with their mini joystick button.  The scrolling through contacts, and their info, is also very well done and something I had not seen other phones do.While I would like to recommend this phone, I can't.  SE did not build this phone around the qualities of good RF and call volume.  These came as afterthoughts when they decided to make the camera and music player with high quality in mind and neglected other important areas.", "Date": "October 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "no contract needed", "Author": "Arturo Reyna", "ReviewID": "R22PNL3ELX9KDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a great phone, i used it with my cingular sim and had no problem with it.
