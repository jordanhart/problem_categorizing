This type of phone only works with T-Mobile & At&T; but be careful and check with At&t; before purchasing. I have T-mobile and the phone works great. The camera on this phone is pretty good and the phone is visually stunning. This phone besides its look is pretty basic though no bells & whistles, so if thats what your looking for this is not the phone for you but if your like me and just want something to talk,text on that looks cute this is it.", "Date": "April 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very good phone", "Author": "David Rolon Dantas", "ReviewID": "R246G2GQ75CZQV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it took a litle long to arrive becouse it came from over seas  but it was a good phone  good phone in good shape", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
