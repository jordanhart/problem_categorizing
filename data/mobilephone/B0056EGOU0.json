I've had mine for two years and it has been the worst phone I've ever owned.  I have had a much better experience with my \"freebie\" flip phones!  Normally Samsung offers quality products, but I don't know what happened with this one.  The screen is constantly freezing, it drops calls, mutes you while on a  call, flashes over to nonexistent calls and won't let you back to your main call.  It makes calls on its own, even when the phone is locked.  The camera is good, but it takes forever to send out pictures to other cells or email addresses.  In fact, it usually fails or shuts the phone down half the time.  The phone gets very hot when you use it for any length of time.  And the touch screen is awful when texting.  You'll spend half your time going back and correcting the words.  There's no T9 availiable, and the autocorrect is rigid and complete rubbish.  Go to the Sprint website and read the reviews - I'm not the only one having these problems.  There are many other aggraveted users out there as well.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0056EGOU0"}}
