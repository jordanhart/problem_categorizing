As all the Sony Walkman phones, it gets clear signals in my home on the hill which is the main reason I am sticking w/ Ericsson Walkman, even iPhone cannot beat it. The only issue w/ this phone is each time using the phone, you need to push the power button to unlock it. It's not alway an easy step, especially while receiving the calls. It caused dropping calls. I haven't found the way to cancel this procedure so give it 4 stars.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just use the slid bar", "Author": "Mosey", "ReviewID": "R3DY505KKE4DMD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read the other review before buying the phone. What concerned me was the info about the dropped calls.Got the phone anyway and couldn't be happier.  I need somthing that has a good radio feature for work andthis one is just great. The thing with the incomming calls.... Read the messages... There is a slide bar at thebottom and you just move it to the left to answer or right to send a busy signal.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony wt13i mix walkman....not worth the money", "Author": "czelea", "ReviewID": "R1T9T45R7RPA6S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The seller gets five stars for service. Everything on par with delivery and all, plus i returned the phone and seller got my money back the next day after they recieved the phone backNow the phone...my phone has to have music, radio, good battery life and good reception. If it is small, light and well built...that's a bonus. Had Nokias for the past 10 yrs, never a Sony Ericsson. Figured maybe the walkman system is better than Nokia's xpress music....wrong.The walkman doesn't let you do anything from your phone (make playlists, folders, move stuff around) unless you plug it in the pc....then what's the point..? The equilizer is non adjustable (manually). The volume thru headphones is weak (on max level). To make matters worse, the headphones (earbuds) that ie comes with are the old school ones instead of the now very popular noise canceling ones. For a \"music phone\", everything that has to do with the music was very disapointing to me.On top of it all, reception was worse than my previous nokia and the screen feedback lags constantly on the simplest commands.My 2c.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a good phone.", "Author": "MN guy", "ReviewID": "RMAYV1DWTU909", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not impressed with this phone. I owned a W810i before this and loved it but the camera and key lock stopped working so thought I would try a touch screen. Here is a list of things I hate.-Screen is to small- trying to hit the right letter while texting is a challenge-Key lock is worthless- Mine really likes to pocket call, pocket text, pocket delete/change phone numbers and turn on walkman.-Camera- VERY sensitive to shaking.  My 2.0mp on my W810i seem to take better quality pictures.-Glitchy- Locks up sometimes. One time it showed wrong name in outgoing calls after I called my wife??-Cheap- it just feels light and flimsy.-Headphones- uncomfortable and don't sound good.Overall I should have seen this coming. The phone was pretty inexpensive. I still love Sony Ericsson and will buy another, just spend alittle more money next time.", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "i", "Author": "Freddy Estrella", "ReviewID": "RYKXTR6KE316S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it great product A + + + + +  + + + + + + + ++ +", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Mr. Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R2FRO04MLFGO18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone was exactly what I was looking for, but here are a few things I would have like to of known befor I bought it. 1.You can use this phone with T-moble and ATT for sure. 2.Texting on the phone is something you will have to get used to, at first i had to put it on multi tap because it wouldnt spell the right word for me but it is getting better. 3.the ZAP feature/button is weird and it doesnt sound right when it switches songs, to me its just a useless button that kinda gets in my way.

I was looking for a phone that could be my MP3 player, too (less to cart around), and this looked like it would fit the bill. I opened it up & got to putting it together, and was aggravated first thing.  And it just kept getting worse.1--The instructions don't include how to get the back cover off without scratching it or, like me, breaking a nail. If I weren't an experienced cell user, I'd have never figured it out.2--Even in silent mode, it makes sounds!3--The menus, and lack thereof, suck horribly. There is no menu key or icon, and things you would normally expect to have a menu don't...like your text message inbox.4--Speaking of text messages, how's this for abso nuts:  YOU CAN'T DELETE THEM! No, I'm not kidding.  I even tried downloading the PDF version of the user manual, thinking there would be better, more complete instructions there. No frickin' luck. The only way I found to delete them was to format & re-install the cell OS. The lack of a way to delete them would be OK if you could move them onto the external SD card & delete them from there, but you can't. And the phone only has 116MB of user available space.  Once that is full, you have to format & redo everything!5--The user manual is a joke.6--The UI is not U friendly.7--If you want to remove the SIM card and keep the phone for an MP3 player, good luck. The only thing you can do without the SIM card inserted is make an emergency call.There were 2 things I liked about it:  1--The MP3 player sounds as good as my Walkman MP3 player; 2--The alarm is nice.I know some of y'all are thinking, \"Come on, girl! What'd you expect for under $100?!\" I tell you what I didn't expect...I didn't expect the $15 emergency \"someone lost mine\" phone I got for my brother from Wal-Mart to be a better deal. For about $20 more than the $73 I spent on this, I could have gotten a Palm Pixie Plus and been much happier.  I just would have been limited to 7G of user available space. Which is probably what I'll do when I return this one today.UPDATE: I found out how to delete a text! Not from the instructions, but from playing with it. You double tap the text message. It's still going back.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005DIPTPU"}}
