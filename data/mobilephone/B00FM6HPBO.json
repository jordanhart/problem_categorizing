After sales support much improved and the seller stands by his product. If it holds up it would have been more than worth the priceI wasn't expecting a great phone. But I did expect a reliable phone. This phone is slow. The camera is at best bad and the sound is \"tinny.\" The seller sent an email promising excellent after sales support. However after one email to him with a very generic comment, I can't get a response from him. The phone freezes and sometimes I get a white screen that forces me to do a hard reset. I guess I got what I paid for", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "peter", "ReviewID": "R3VZA5TC4VZPOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone is great size of screen is excelent for viewing pictures and videos easy to use key boards anddial keys", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "this phone did not work", "Author": "Keisha asay", "ReviewID": "R2OFJ3MU4ZHC09", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone didn't work.
