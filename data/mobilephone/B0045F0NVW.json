Completely reliable,ruggedized for those dropped phone moments,user friendly. I have been eligible for new phones over the years and bought this phone to replace the one I had for 6 years rather than accept a new phone from verizon. Once I left my phone on top of the car and it took a 30 mile ride before falling off in the middle of busy Montauk Hwy. It was run over at least once. A friendly stranger found it on the road and called one of my contact numbers,who went and got it for me. The phone continued operating perfectly for another year.  If they only made ALL electronic devices so well.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Bluetooth compatible with devices that support the headset and handsfree profiles\nIntegrated GPS navigation through Verizon Wireless' VZ Navigator\nLarge, high-resolution internal 1.9-inch 176 x 220 pixel TFT display\nIntegrated VGA camera for easy capturing of high-quality images\nMultimedia Messaging Service (MMS) to share favorite photos, ringtones and more with ease", "Name": "Motorola V325i Cell Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31SxsGMVpFL.jpg", "ProductID": "B0045F0NVW"}}
