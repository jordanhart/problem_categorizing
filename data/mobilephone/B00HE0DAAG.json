I have used so many phones/OS that I am fascinated by the diversity of ecosystem. I have used HTC Titan, some previous Lumia series  and past Windows Mobile series. After dabbling with iOS, webOS, WM, I have settled on a Android as a primary phone. Nokia Lumia series is elegantly designed. The 1520 is just gorgeous.I am interested in the specs of Lumia from following parameters. phone: size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR ratingNokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP,  Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU  Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)In my opinion, following are key specs to consider. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don\u2019t advertize or mention SAR prominently.The things that pop out is the screen size and the external storage capability. Obviously weight is a downside. The windows phone 8 operating system has matured to a large extent and most of common apps are available. It does still lag its distant cousins iOS and Android. But Nokia has given a splendid hardware. My experience of using camera (one of the best cameras in the smartphone and a key differentiator), navigation, reading articles, books, listening to music, watching videos were flawless. I highly recommend to anyone interested in windows platform. This phone is something to definitely checkout!As for a comparative analysis I have laid the specs of other top 2014 phones. I am sticker to useful specs and I find following spec will help you decide the best phone for your use case.Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version):  5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)HTC One: 5.41 x 2.69 x 0.37 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.7 in, 469 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 4 MP/2.1MP, Qualcomm APQ8064T Snapdragon 600, Quad-core 1.7 GHz Krait 300, 0.66 W/kg (head), 0.40 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phantastic Phone!!!!", "Author": "Ken W.", "ReviewID": "RQONTGLC7IUQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone surpassed my expectations.

My wife wanted a bigger phone display with a nice camera for school, and I wanted a phone that would take good pictures and have a native GPS receiver.  I bought 2 of these unlocked and online.  We have had these a little over a month now, and are very satisfied with our purchase.  It takes great pictures, has a big beautiful display, and an actual internal GPS that works as well or better than the one in your car.  Yes, international maps are free.  Just get a street address and you can search for it on the phone off line without using cellular data.  I also like the way it synchronizes the calendar and pictures with your computer seamlessly just by plugging it into the USB port.I did have 2 issues with it in one day.  I read about soft reset online.  In 10 minutes, it was back at the Nokia screen like nothing ever happened.  The problem has never returned.What I don't like is the availability of apps written for windows phones.  However, it comes with some great apps installed like a free MS Office as well as photo editing and a great calendar app.  It appears to me that the number of apps written for it is growing and as long as they continue to make great products like this, the number will continue to grow!", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Hector Ramon Escalona Mendez", "ReviewID": "R17MWM6XRGCTAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent very good", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "amazing phone", "Author": "Randy A.

And the battery life is amazing. I unplug it at 4:45 am and at 11 pm I still have almost half battery life left. With iPhone or note 3, I had to plug it in as soon as I got home. All the important apps are available. So you really won't miss much making the switch to windows 8. Love watching Netflix on my lunch break with this phone. Amazing screen quality, awesome camera.

But that\u2019s not the case. Its very fragile. Not like its predecessor.I dropped this phone from my pocket a few days back and the display broke. And this is just a 20 days old phone. I just dropped it that one time.This is the same lumia 1520 that nokia claims to be strong, a durable one.I have used Nokia N95 and Nokia Lumia 800. Both were durable. Dropped it so many times and never broke.Especially the lumia 800 which my wife is still using has been dropped a million times, still works like a charm. Not even a scratchSo looks like this Flagship model, Lumia 1520 is not made of the same quality as its predecessor and its pretty much fragile.When i contacted nokia about this, they said due to this physical damage, my mobile is now out of warranty. I have to cover the expenses now.It costs around 200$ to replace the display. Come on, i cant spend 200$ every time i drop this phone.i should have bought a case. but the problem with the caseis that, this mobile is already huge enough to handle with one hand. This case might increase the size a bit, and i thought atending the calls would become tedious. And considering the durability of Lumia 800 which i already own, i thought this phone would also be made of good quality.This phone tends to slip out easily out of my hands as its huge and weighs a lotNokia service centre ignored my case even though i am a loyal customer. I have always been a Nokia customer. Apart from the Nokia N95 and Lumia 800, i have bought several other phones including the E5 and many other Models, which ofcourse i dont remember now. They have been mailing me Mail templates instead of a proper reply.http://youtu.be/8EWuz4YEk9kEven though i explained my case several times, they are not ready to replace the phone. Instead they wanna consider my case as a feedback.All these Nokia Flagships phones have been very sentimental to me. And i was very heartbroken when this mobile broke. Never broke a phone before. And nokia is not ready to help me out.SO, if u are really considering to buy this Lumia 1520, be ready to spend 200$ every time you drop it.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonderful !", "Author": "Edwin Arulraj", "ReviewID": "R1VAHKP36N2ZS5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is awesome \u2026DisplayCameraSpeedVery nice phone to use and most of the common apps available now in Windows", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sadly I have to give it two stars", "Author": "L. Taylor", "ReviewID": "RBJHOVOLW2N1U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Though the OS is second to none IMO - and the design, shape and size being brilliant, I have to score this phone (not necessarily the AT&T; or TMO branded phones), but the Nokia factory phone,  as lame. When I first got it the OS was 8.0 and I had a few issues.1. The unlock screen would register taps that I did not do. This being rectified by hitting the power button to lock it and then bring it back to the unlock screen.2. Sometimes when the keyboard would come up it would be all fuzzy, though it would clear up after 5 - 10 seconds, it was hard to read and sucked to have to wait.3. Signal strength at certain locations (my house for one) would drop to no service. This in comparison to my 925,821 and HTC 8x, where the signal was fine. So I am not sure if this is a phone issue or a TMO service issue. But TMO sent out a signal booster and that did not do  much.Nokia says it is TMO's fault cuz the signal is fine downtown and therefore cannot be hardware so it must be TMO - Makes sense.  TMO says it is Nokia's fault because my other phones work at home and the 1520 does not, which also makes sense.4. Camera button seems to be hyper sensitive, so much so that if you touch the housing on the back of the phone and not the actual button the camera will come on.. though this is not an every time occurrence, it happens enough to be a major pain when trying to actual do work on the phone.So I installed windows 8.1 - now since it is not a supported OS, TMO no longer cares nor does Nokia.So I am stuck with a phone where at home I have no service and when I am out and about and want to do something on the phone I have the lock screen issue and the damned camera problem to contend with.. Though on the plus side, the blurry keyboard problem seemed to have gone away with 8.1.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "switched", "Author": "KENNETH ADAMS", "ReviewID": "R2QUT2BTCZBH7J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good phone.I am returning it, the add said 32 gig and I received a 16 gig.
