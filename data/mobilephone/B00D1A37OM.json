The battery life is really good, I use the phone to Skype my family in NY and its probably the best video chat experience on a phone I ever had. I use it to listen to music in my car with Pandora app there are no commercials which I love. I use the GPS & the Nokia maps are great. Overall a great phone the only negative thing I would say is the lack of apps, Windows is still catching up to Apple & Google but besides that great value.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Camman", "ReviewID": "R1VDW3IKDQ453B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Work frist time after sim card was put in, strong sig.

My work often sends me to foreign lands, and when I arrive at my destination, I purchase local SIM cards for my current Nokia.  Since I always bought INTERNATIONAL versions of my previous Nokia phones, I've never had a problem with compatibility with local networks.  With my Nokia phones, I also stuck with the flagship models.  Nokia's maps & GPS always seems to be better than what my co-workers might bring with them.  Nokia's models also seemed sturdier than what other brands offered.Last spring, my old Nokia N97 began to have a screen display problem.  I started looking for a replacement, and the first thing I found was that Nokia has abandoned their old Symbian operating system.  I never really liked that system, but I was used to it, and it had matured over the years to where it was working well with my Windows desktop, laptop and other devices.  I had equated the Symbian OS on my first couple of Nokia's with the one old desktop that I had run using the LINUX OS.  You had to be pretty geeky to use it, but it was pretty powerful if you were an \"IT\" guy.By staying with Nokia, my first compromise was giving up Symbian for the Windows Phone 8 OS.  I held off on that decision until I could 'hands on' try Android and WP8.Then, as I researched the Lumia 9xx 'flagship' models, I immediately discovered that the batteries were sealed in the case, and that there was no sdMicro card slot.  Those two missing things were an immediate deal breaker for me.  I am so used to carrying a 2nd battery, and a backup sdMicro card when I travel - I can't imagine traveling without them.I had to bump down my Nokia choices to the next best models, the Lumia 8xx models.  That meant the AT&T; 820, the Verizon 822, or the T-Mobile 810 as the only three to choose from.  I don't like AT&T; as a company, and Verizon doesn't service my area, so I'd be staying with T-Mobile.My next step was to go to the T-Mobile store, and try their Windows Phone 8 models.  There was an HTC, a Samsung, and the Nokia 810 all running on WP8.  I played with all three, and found them quite similar, except that the Nokia had the really cool Nokia map & GPS based apps already installed.  The new WP8 OS was instantly easy to navigate.  I really liked it.  I bought the Lumia 810 outright, right in the store.After two days at home, the Lumia died.  It just turned itself off, and nothing would wake it up.  The only way to get it going again was to remove the back, pull the battery loose, reinsert it, and it was back running again.  Over the next week, with the phone just sitting on my desk, it did the same thing several times, seemingly at random.  Some web searching found that a lot of people had the same problem... but some didn't.  I saw that T-Mobile had discontinued the phone the same week that I had bought mine.  I took mine back to T-Mobile, got my refund, and put my old Nokia N97 back into service.  T-Mobile still didn't have their Lumia 925 model available.  I'd have to wait.During the next few months, I kept checking on what was available, and also hoping that HTC or Samsung might have a comparable interchangeable battery model available.  But, wait!  Some other models with interchangeable batteries were reporting similar problems.  Not nearly a many as the Lumia 810, but there were some.When the T-Mobile Lumia 925 finally arrived, it was heralded as the best of the Lumia 9xx series.  I still hesitated, and then the AT&T; came out with their Lumia 1020 model - which I assume will be followed by the Verizon and T-Mobile versions.  Awesome phone, but obviously, the sealed case is here to stay.  I went back to researching, and decided to try for an International version of the Lumia 810 on Amazon.  If I got another one with the same problem as the first one, I could easily return it, and resign myself to a phone with a sealed case.When this one arrived, I put it to the test for three weeks before going to T-Mobile for a new SIM card.  After several faultless days, I tried it with a 2nd new Nokia battery, and three days later, it went belly up.  I put the original battery back in, and tested for another two weeks, without a glitch.  About two weeks ago, I went back to T-Mobile, and changed the SIM card.  (Actually, they just cut the old N97 SIM down to the micro size).  The Lumia 810 is still running without a hitch.  I'm glad I took the chance on getting one of the good ones.It's apparent to me that the current sellers of this phone bought up T-Mobile's remaining stock, certainly knowing that some would undoubtedly be returned.  Now that I have a good one, I would have given it five stars... I do love it.  The missing fifth star is due to the relatively poor interface with Windows 7 on the esktop.  Symbian (and OVI) eventually got their interface with Windows to be very robust.  I could manage so many things on the phone through my desktop, especially the CONTACTS list with OUTLOOK.  Now, I'm back to the infancy days of Windows desktop management of my phone data and files.Since MICROSOFT has recently purchased most of the NOKIA company, I'm assuming that the desktop - phone interface will be greatly improved in the near future.  That would make this phone worthy of five stars.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Ray Ramirez Sr.", "ReviewID": "R3GSLXRTWZZ5ZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great.

The Lumia 810 was specifically created for T-Mobile and was originally sold on a 2-year contract. The company no longer offers the phone but does support it and it can be used on any T-Mobile plan. I currently use my 810 on the company's $30 a month phone/data/text plan that gives me everything I need. I added a 32GB micro SD card for music, photos and videos because the phone only has 8GB HD but it hasn't been a problem whatsoever. The 810 is - in my opinion - one of the better looking - if not slightly thicker - Windows phones available but I have been very happy with it. The built-in HERE Drive app is worth the price of admission and the Nokia MixMusic app is a very solid ad-free streaming service that can be upgraded with unlimited skips for $3.99 a month.Update 4/6/2014: T-Mobile is not providing additional software updates to the Lumia 810 despite the fact that Nokia is making them available. The Nokia Black update that was pushed out to T-Mobile's 520 and 925 Lumia models was not made available the 810 and there's a strong belief it will not be able to receive the upcoming 8.1 OS update from Microsoft/Nokia which will likely affect the phone's ability to load newer apps. There's some discussion that Microsoft/Nokia have said that all Lumias currently running WP 8.0 will be upgraded regarded of carrier support - including the 810 - but that is by no means certain and I wouldn't invest $200+ in a phone that is at this moment EOL'd. That said, this phone is still very solid, works well and if you don't need the latest/greatest is an affordable choice for 95% of smartphone customers who prefer the WindowsPhone operating system and don't want to settle for the 500-series models the company is selling for $99.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice product", "Author": "Grobo", "ReviewID": "R3PQWG4STPOF50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had it a few days.

I've owned for nearly two months and it's great! as far as stability and consistency is concerned it's comparable to the Blackberry OS.

I love that feature as I have family in England and we chat at least once a week. I haven't tested it on 3 or 4G though, I've always done it on WiFi.The camera is great (front and back) and the flash is way, way better than most phone flashes (not camera's - they're still the best).oh and one last thing, this is the T-Mobile and you can get it working, as I did, on Straight-Talk, but you will need to download the following App, via WiFi: Access Point, the description says it's designed for phones with two SIMs, that's not the case for this phone but it still lets you add APN settings and then make it the primary, thus swerving around the built in T-Mobile settings, which I can't delete. I haven't had any dropped calls but I do experience MMS issues every once in a while, nothing major, I just have to re-send and that seems to do the trick, and that might not even be a phone issue if I'm to be honest.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "One of the best Windows Phone Nokia Lumia 810 8GB T-Mobile", "Author": "Tin Lo", "ReviewID": "RT4JGFSBU5CTT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good product, Excellent.

I had the Iphone 3G that I could not update and so I pretty much only used it to text and call.  After purchasing this phone I saw everything that I had been missing on by holding on to an old phone for so long. I saw what phones are capable of these days. I had my eye on Android but I find the OS a little cluttered. Plus my Nook tablet is running Android and it is nothing special, so I gave the Windows OS a try and it is the smoothest OS I have used.  This Windows phone really gives you a bang for your buck. The camera quality is excellent. I am the type of student who likes to make copies of other people's notes and I must say that when I take pictures of the document, I can see every detail written on the page. It is crisp, clear, and very readable. I no longer have to bring yet another device with me to do a simple task. Years ago, I would take my digital camera, a phone, a tape recorder, an ipod, and a watch with me, but now, in 2013, the only thing I need is this phone. The mp3/mp4 player is excellent. Your music is nicely organized, which can be  loaded through a MicroSD card.  The application selection available through the Microsoft store is satisfactory. I have found an app. for every task that I need them for. Of course, the selection isn't as broad as that of the Itunes store but really, who needs that many? This phone also has a great GPS that has directed me to places I would never had visited otherwise. Another function that I like is the capability of sharing your internet.
