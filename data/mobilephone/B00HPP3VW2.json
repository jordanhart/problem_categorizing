{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Value Smart Phone Ever Made. Period.", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "RK8NXEUQ5OF3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you do your homework you will see the specifications on this phone blow away any phone in it's price range.If you want to take a step up and have 4g lte, for $100 more, you could go with an LG Optimus f7. For $200, that is the best phone at that price range by far.But this phone rivals that phone in most regards except video camera definition (720 vs. 1080) and the LG offers an SD slot for added phone memory. I do think the MOTO G has a better picture display than the f7. But it is very close. Plus I like the MOTO G's quad core 1200 processor over the LG's 1500 dual core. But the difference, again, is negligible.Personally, after doing extensive research, comparing phones and using this phone, I could never justify $500+ for a galaxy 4 or Iphone 5s when I could have this phone for $100. Don't get me wrong, those phones are AMAZING phones, but the value isn't there like it is with the MOTO G.With that being said, I do not need 4g and I do not need added memory space with an sd slot as I use my IPOD for all of my music.But the 8 gigs of space on this phone is quite a bit anyway. So unless you need more space than that, this is the perfect phone.The picture is absolutely amazing. And the phone runs very very smooth.Plus the battery on this phone, which rates  2070 mah, is impressive, and since the phone is good at not sucking energy, it out performs that number and evens rates higher in talk time than the f7's 2540 mah battery.Finally, the screen is a perfect size at 4.5 inches and the reception is amazing.Quite frankly, I am a bit confused why a phone that performs this well is selling for only $100.Easily the most value in a phone you can purchase.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone at a great price!!!!!!!!", "Author": "kirsten edgar", "ReviewID": "R3M0YSORIGOADG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't have a ton of money to spend on my new phone and one of my co-workers recommended the Moto G.

Maney \"Marty913\"", "ReviewID": "RUL1IGN31I8OS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I believe you have to evaluate this phone from a value perspective, not a feature perspective. You also have to consider that this phone is not targeted toward the contract buyer (free phone with a $70 - $100 monthly bill). The target is the pay-as-you-go user that typically spends $30-$40 a month, and probably has to buy their own phone. This phone shouldn't be compared to an iPhone or Galaxy 4/5, but rather to a used 2 or 3  year old Droid/HTC etc. For me, this phone is an excellent value (although certainly not perfect).This phone uses the Boost/Sprint network technology (CDMA). It will also work on other CDMA-based networks but would require programming changes to be made. It will NOT work on ATT or T-Mobile networks (GSM). I'm a PagePlus user which uses the Verizon network (CDMA). Changes were required but were relatively easy for someone comfortable with computers.ProsCurrent technology, new phone for less than $100Quad-Core processor (very fast)1GB Internal System memorySupports Android 4.4.2 (KitKat)Front & Rear CamerasScreen, size, weight, battery life are all excellentConsNo SD card slot. If you have 1000's of songs or pictures, probably not your phone3G (this is not a 4G phone)Battery not removableCamera acceptable but not greatI summary, the older used phones I have been using could not support the newer Android versions (Jelly Bean, KitKat) so the new App pool was shrinking for me. I don't carry around 1000's of song/pictures so the lack of an SD card slot was not a big deal. The Moto G works on my carrier (PagePlus Verizon) and was roughly the price of an outdated used phone. So far, I'm very happy with the purchase. As always, Amazon did a great job getting it to me quickly.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Moto G is the best phone I ever had", "Author": "Eric Mas", "ReviewID": "RBFKL86M6SBJ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this phone to replace my 2 year old HTC 4 G Evo Design.  I bought it based on the reviews I read and despite that it is only 3 G.  For $99.00, I thought let's buy it and will see.  Got it this week and I am so happy with it.  THIS IS THE BEST PHONE I EVER HAD.  It blows always my previous SAMSUNG GALAXY 2 and HTC 4G EVO DESIGN.  The design, the interface, the speed are amazing.  I like also how intuitive is the menu and how Motorola had customize it.  It also had a FM radio that is working so well.  And the 3G on this phone is faster that my 4 G on my HTC.  Doesn't make sense to me, but I can listen Internet music while driving and it never get cut off. When my older phone was on either 3 G or 4G, I always had time with no reception.  The battery is very good.  Just try the camera and its quality is fine.  It is 5MP and it is not as good as an iPhone or new Samsung, but iPhone or Galaxy S5  is 5 time the price of this phone.

Pena", "ReviewID": "R2A3CD29MVCP9F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lost my job and the phone that came with it which was the galaxy s3. I needed a phone that was good and cheap since I didn't want to pork over $$$ for the latest and greatest and who wants to be stuck with a contract???After doing some research, I bought the moto g for $80 bucks. Now coming from the S3 which was feature laden was giving me some heartburn about stepping down. Well it turns out the Moto G is a pretty decent phone--especially for a 3G. Battery life is phenomenal. I use it all day and maybe get to 50%. The toggle of wifi when wifi is available is great as I don't have to worry about turning the wifi on or off manually and saves on battery. The display is awesome. I keep the brightness at about a 1/4 level and it is bright enough, even on a bright day outside.Did I also mention that the software is updated to KIT KAT 4.2!! One of the first to get an update!!.Go Motorola...Calls with boost are pretty good.Now some of the things I don't like. The stock SMS text and Hangouts app are not the best text apps. I prefer the Samsung text. Maybe some can put me to an app that can improve on that.Keyboard is ok. Prefer Swype but that is a personal preference.No SD card slot. While I am able to manage the memory-thanks to the kit kat upgrade it would be nice to not have to worry about the memory limits.Overall, I would recommend this phone. I am hoping that once I get employed, My new employer will provide a phone that I don't have to pay for.

Not only is the phone pleasant to look at, but it's also quick and easy to use. I'm normally an Apple user, so I noticed the similarities between the KitKat OS and iOS 7. It feels very streamlined. My only complaint is the quality of sound when using the phone. The receiver isn't as loud as I had hoped for. The speaker on the back has excellent sound however. Now the service can vary. I don't have any problems with dropped calls or missed messages since I live in the New York City area. So if you're having signal problems, it's highly likely that it's where you live that's the cause of the problem.

I am not going to repeat what has already been said. This is more of a warning notice instead. I have no complaints about the phone itself, except that i wish i had known that Boost Mobile disables the HotSpot feature. So please be careful, if you do plan on using the phone as a HotSpot for any reason, then you will need to go through a different company than Boost Mobile.When you go to WiFi options and enable the HotSpot, it will immediately disable it, followed by a message that says that Boost has disabled the use of this feature. I have even tried using other known proven apps that bypass this feature, and it still disables it.I find this to be just wrong and unfair for them to do this because they are essentially taking away a feature that many people use, just so that they don't have to worry about people taking advantage of its unlimited data feature, even tho it isn't truly unlimited anyway. It varies either way depending on which card you buy each month. So before purchasing it, check with the provider to ensure that you do not run into this problem .I give this 1 star due to this.

I watched several video reviews and tutorials on youtube (which I STRONGLY suggest doing). I've had this phone for about a month now and it's perfect for me. I am a user who is looking for value but also quality.I like to use social media on my phone, I like downloading a few apps/games. But I want a phone that will work and do what it is supposed to do without errors.To make it short and simple, even though this phone is 3g, with it's quad core processor, it's FAST! Downloads take no time. There is no lag on any apps, phone calls, or functions. It has the update for the new Android 4.4 KitKat, which is very nice. I love the Gorilla glass screen, it literally feels smooth and soft, smudges easily wipe off. The first thing I noticed right out of the box was the screen and how well it felt to touch,swipe, and hold. The phone itself is sleek, professional, and overall attractive looking.I've had no complaints with the cameras either. It does include a front and rear facing camera, the quality is good.Most importantly, and this is where the phone gets a lot of critique, is the memory. This phone does NOT take an SD card. It is an 8gb phone, out of the box you have 5.5gb of available space. BUT it does include the Google Drive app which allows you an additional 50gb of \"cloud space\" to save some things. I have download roughly 10 apps and have 4gb of space available. I try to be mindful that I only have 4gb of space, so I keep my apps and extras minimized. I also store my photos and music on Google Drive so I can maximize as much space as I can. I have had no issues with this whatsoever. Like I said, be mindful of what you need and don't need. If your the type to download dozens of apps and store hundreds of photos, this might be an issue for you.Overall, this phone is an excellent buy. The price can not be beat! What an amazing value.

I'm not a rich guy and don't have hundreds of dollars to spend on a phone, but I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. Also - all my friends and co-workers had them and I was jealous and did not want to be left-out.or considered to be \"uncool\" for not being able to play Angry Birds when I was supposed to be working. Also - I did not like the idea of being in a contract, as noticed that the pay-as-you-go-cell phone plans were nearly always cheaper than the contract plans, anyway. So, my choice was clear: I had to get a smartphone, and I had to get one cheap. The problem was, most of the really cheap smartphones work like, well... like really cheap phones. The call quality was terrible. Processor speeds were very slow, making it nearly impossible to actually USE the phone for anything it was supposed to be able to do (I STILL couldn't play Angry Birds!!!), screen size and quality was mediocre at best.And don't EVEN get me started on battery life! Better be sure to always have a charger nearby, that's all I'm saying.That was my experience with budget smartphones UNTIL I got this Moto G for Boost Mobile. This phone is simply AMAZING for the price! The screen is clear and bright. The Gorilla glass resists cracks and scratches (though it does smudge easily from fingertips, but wipes off clean). The processor is quick and runs nearly any app I need without a hitch (YAY! Angry Birds finally!), it's thin and light and fits easily in my jeans pocket.And the battery life? AMAZING! I get a FULL 24 HOURS on a single charge! Crazy! My last phone was lucky to go more than 6 hours between charges, even if I barely used it! This Moto G gives me a full day of moderate use (I use this phone for work a lot, as well as for personal use, too) and STILL lasts 24 hours!

I think it is legitimate to discuss both the phone and the carrier in this review as the phone is specifically for the boost network.First the phone.  I love it. It's quick has a great screen, feels good in the hand, and looks good. My only real complaint is the lack of external storage capacity.  I know this is an inexpensive phone and to get to this price point with this hardware they had to cut costs somewhere, but still.  How much more could that have cost?  $5?  I would have gladly paid that.  But I did know that going in and the cost/benefit ratio of this phone is very very goodNow for Boost.  I was on boost a number of years ago.  Internet was spotty.  I figured it was the best I would be able to get on prepaid in my area so I suffered with it for a year or two.  I switched to Virgin because of phone options and the service was much better on virgin.  They are both on the sprint network so I assumed this was a function of the phone rather than the network.  The phone was an old optimus V.  I switched back to Boost to get this phone as it was not available on Virgin.  My internet drops more now with the moto g than it did with the ancient optimus V.  I used to be able to steam Rhapsody from home all the way to work, about a 30 minute drive, without it dropping a single time.  Now it drops numerous times.  I know that both Boost and Virgin are on sprint so I don't know why there would be a difference, but I have a hard time believing the moto go is inherantly more prone to dropping coverage than was the optimus V.Anyway, I was hoping to get a Google Nexus 5 in about 6 months and put it on Verizon but the optimus finally gave out.

Probably. Strange, phone?  Definitely --especially, the Accessibilities. If you turn them on, be ready for this phone to behave as if it is possessed! And, if you do turn them on, you may not be able to get into Settings to undo, it! It took me nearly 2 hours to get into Settings and to the proper subheading. The apps NOT on the Desktop were only shown in a single page. any more apps, and you are out of luck unless they are already on the Desktop. It is possible to delete, apps, and use them, but the process is very nearly impossible, it is so dicey. This is important, enough, that I believe it belongs at the top.Now, for the rest:1. The screen is good, and the icons are clear.2. The usability is okay, but nothing special.3. Battery life --talk time isn't anywhere approaching the advertised number, but it is really, good! Screen-intensive apps don't burn the battery, all that fast.4. The phone, itself, is very nearly indestructible, given the excellent construction. I dropped it, several times, and held my breath, that it would still work. Not, a scratch.5. The speed dial still needs work, but is far exceeding the Prevail, Rush, Incognito, or any previous Boost phone I have had ...except for the BlackBerry model (of which I have had three --one, with a different carrier). Tap, & dial.6. The 'Back' button is on the wrong side, for me --all other phones had it on the right. This one, is on the left. Sheesh.7. All Contacts is a little difficult to use, via phone. Best, to use the People Icon. Much, faster.8. Voice to text is very nearly error-free, but when it does mess up, it gives one alternatives, if the word is tapped. Very many times, the choices have been correct.9. Backup of data seems to work better than the phone indicates. I have received errors on the backup --only to find that the items were, indeed, backed up. I'll take it, and run like a thief.10. Email is a bit troublesome. I have had trouble with receiving some of my contacts' emails in the Inbox. One, I had to relegate to Social, or it wouldn't appear at all. Previous phones, put that same contact in the Inbox without question.The Accessibility option, kept this phone from getting stars.

The only negatives I would give it would be I do not like that it has no SD memory card slot, although there is an internal SD memory which i think is emulated or whatever but in any event it acts like an internal SD memory card for data storage, backups, etc. Easy enough to hook up via USB cable to transfer data to and from the phone, or using fastboot tool on the PC one can root the phone for greater control over it. Another negative is this phone has no removable battery, so I guess if the phone ever jammed up you could not remove a battery to completely reset/unjam it. But for $99 you get a lot: quad core, hi resolution display, slim. I mean, $99, this is a quad core smartphone for the cost of about 8 pizzas so how much can a person expect? You want a phone with SD card slots and more, I guess go pay $299 or get an expensive 2 year contract phone with a non-Boost company. This phone feels like a $200+ phone so I am satisfied.

Very vivid, good detail, easy to see in daylight and very responsive.The phone itself is fast for 3g, much faster than the 3G LG I went from with Virgin Mobile, who uses the same sprint network.I bought two of these phones and neither came with Kit Kat.

They seem and appear almost identical except for the phone dialer (like jelly bean better) and some more controls in the settings but I am no expert on the differences between the two..Most of the upgrades for kit kat will not benefit me based on what I read..Warning, if you do upgrade to kit kat, you can not go back, not very easily at least if you can even do it at all..phone has nice logical buttons with a good tactile feel and feels solid.

I especially love that it updated automatically to the Kitkat 4.4.2 OS after purchase.  One disappointment is that although it sports a 4.5 screen, the actual visual display is really 4.1, since the home keys are incorporated into part of the viewing space.  Too bad Motorola didn't separate the home keys outside of the viewing space, so that we'd actually have the full 4.5 as advertised.  And although it does have the Gorilla glass, I installed a screen saver on mine, just to keep it nice.  Another let-down was not having an SD card slot to expand the memory space.  But not having an SD card slot isn't that much of a bother to me, since I don't install much apps onto my phones.For me, it does play YouTube videos quite well.  The camera takes nice pictures also, but am a little disappointed that I can't seem to adjust the pic resolution for MMS purposes (640x480) and Facebook.  I also installed a volume locker onto my Moto G, since I've noticed lately, that when opening some apps on my phone, the volume settings gets altered quite often.  So the volume locker app ensures that I maintain maximum volume output, since I do work in a noisy environment.The stock text message app is okay, as it is just a simple, easy to use text app without much bells and whistles.  For me, I use another keyboard app from Google Play (TouchPal X), since I didn't fancy the stock keyboard at all.  I love the keyboard app that I'm using now because to me, it seems to be more friendlier and easier to use for us \"Lefties!\"Yes... I could've spent a couple hundred dollars more for a phone with a much bigger display, the only problem of having a bigger phone is being a little annoyed of feeling such a large mass moving about in my pants pocket.  Another disappointment with such phones, is that most of them seem to still be running Android 4.1, although am not sure if the OS would update after purchase.The price of this phone coupled with such a great service provider, and with just enough firepower under its hood to keep things running up to specs... it's a worthy investment.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great phone", "Author": "Feeling22 \"erica\"", "ReviewID": "R32GHFASB5HP9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a great phone with a few flaws. 1.it doesn't have hdmi out. 2.no sd card slot. 3.unlike the kindle tablet, it doesn't have copy/paste buttons in the keyboard.
