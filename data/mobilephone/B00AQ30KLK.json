{"Reviews": [{"Title": "More than adequate.  The best you are going to get until the S3 or Nexus get to Virgin Mobile.", "Author": "S. Power", "ReviewID": "R1C4DI1BDPJDWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Virgin Mobile has always been a great value, delivering acceptable phones and service at a far lower total cost of ownership than the big contract carriers. Low cost coupled with much more flexible terms, from being contract-free, makes these carriers worthy of consideration for all cell phone consumers.The downside to Virgin Mobile, is that the phones that they offer are always about a year behind the current, cutting edge offerings. This remains true, however being a year behind is mattering less and less now that smart phone technology is reaching a plateau. I'm not saying that the iPhone 5 is not better than the iPhone 4S, that the Samsung Galaxy S3 is not better than the Samsung Galaxy S2, or that 2012 HTC Evo 4G is not better than the 2010 version of the same phone. What I'm saying is that the improvements are far more nuanced now, in 2012, than they were in 2010 or earlier. Getting a phone with last year's technology is not as big of a deal now as it once was, especially when you look at the cost difference.This phone, the Samsung Galaxy S2 4G is obviously not the newest version of this phone available. If you want the very newest and best, you won't get that on Virgin Mobile or any other budget priced contract free carrier. It is however very adequate, and by far the best phone ever offered for this low of a total cost of ownership.I have had six different Android phones on Virgin Mobile, including the HTC EVO 4G, Motorola Triumph, Optimus, etcetera. I bought this phone in November 2012 at Radio Shack, the day that it became available. I still have an HTC Evo 4G in our family, but personally have been using this phone for over a month now, quite heavily.This Samsung Galaxy S2 4G runs Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), which is currently (at the time of this review) one version behind the newest versions of Android (Jelly Bean 4.1 & 4.2). It has a fast dual core processor, good 8MP camera, is 4G capable, has great battery life, and has overall great performance. Although it has been out for over a year on Sprint, it is not nearly as far behind the mainstream as previous Virgin Mobile offerings have been.Size. This phone is more similar in size to the Motorola Triumph than it is to the bulkier HTC EVO V 4G. With a 4.52\" AMOLED touch screen and a thin body, it is the most compact phone for the screen size that Virgin has ever had available. I really like the form factor. After using it for about a week without a case, I put an Otterbox Defender on it. That case bulks the phone up quite a bit, but it is still comfortable. I like it with or without the case, but got the case because of my clumsiness and lifestyle.Cases. Since this phone is identical to the one that has been on Sprint for over a year, there are plenty of great cases available for it, including ones from top of the line companies like Otter Box. There are many times more accessories available for it than for previous Virgin Mobile phones, except for the HTC Evo V 4G which also had a lot of cases to choose from.Screen. I love the 4.52\" screen size, and this one is even sharper and more vivid than the one on the HTC Evo 4G, which was better than the Motorola Triumph. It is great.Touch Screen. The touch screen is very responsive, accurate, and precise. By far the best touch screen I've ever used. Even better (or equal to) the one on the Apple Ipod Touch. I use that comparison because I've always felt that the Touch was better than the Android phones I'd had in the past. The HTC Evo V 4G is the same in this regard. Both phones have excellent touch screens.Keyboard. The touch screen keyboard on this phone is awesome. The touchscreen keyboard on the HTC EVO V 4G was far better than any of the previous Virgin Mobile offerings, and this one on the Samsung Galaxy S2 is even better.Battery. The battery life on this phone is incredible because of its increased size and better power management and network management. It lasts 3 times longer than the battery on the Motorola Triumph, and about twice as long as the one on the HTC EVO V 4G. I like that this phone gives you an actual percentage reading for the battery instead of just the imprecise icon.Network management. This phone is great at making seamless transitions between 3G, 4G, and Wifi, always switching to the best available choice. The HTC Evo V 4G used to give me some problems in this area. The S2 is flawless at this.Camera. The 8MP camera on this phone is far better than any cell phone I've ever had. I think that it rivals the iPhone and in most conditions can fully replace your compact point and shoot camera. The video camera shoots 1080p video and is also very good.4G. Having 4G is great, especially since the Virgin Mobile 3G network is a little slow sometimes.Internet Sharing. The ability to share this phone's internet connection is awesome and works really well. It works great on both 3G and especially 4G. It is simple to use, and at $15 a month is a much better value than a Mifi card.Call Quality. The call quality is great on this phone, and is much better than the Motorola Triumph which sometimes sounded muffled, and slightly better than the HTC EVO V 4G which wasn't bad. It is clear for both you and the person you are talking to.Bluetooth. The Bluetooth on this phone works great both with a headset and with my car. I love how it seamlessly transitions from my Podcast Application (Doggcatcher), Navigation, and phone calls.Processor. This phone is snappy and doesn't seem to have any processor induced lag at all. No matter what I run or play, it works the way it is supposed to, even when I'm multi-tasking. The processor seems to be more than adequate.Durability. This phone is no more or less durable than any of the other plastic smart phones out there. I personally wish that more phones were available with unibody metal housings. I used to wish the same things about laptops and they are finally moving that way. Hopefully more phones will be more durable in the future. Anyway, this phone is adequate in this area.Reliability. So far, I have had no issues with applications or functions crashing on this phone. It works consistently and flawlessly. I will update this review if I find anything getting hung-up or crashing. I have had the phone since they first released it, and still haven't had any problems. My experience in this area was the same on the HTC EVO V 4G.If there are any topics that you wanted me to address that I failed to, please let me know in the comments and I will update this review for you.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great as of now", "Author": "kristen peed", "ReviewID": "R2XVA277SBICFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I changed to this phone from the Motorola Triumph and it was a good choice.

Also, the picture quality is much higher on my new phone ( takes pictures as well as my actual camera!). The battery life is also about three times longer, which comes in handy when I'm away from the house all day.

My dream phone has finally arrived.", "Author": "Matthew McConnell", "ReviewID": "RTJW8V3M89UM7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So a couple of weeks ago, I finally got fed-up with my old phone (the HTC EVO V 4G). It was laggy, the battery life was dreadful, and the camera on it--even though it was a 3D camera and claimed to be \"high quality\"--sucked. Heck, ONE scratch on the lens part of the camera made it so the flash function added a greenish hue to every picture I took; I could basically not use my flash. Just imagine my frustration, especially considering this happened just a couple of months after owning it.What sucks is...when I bought this phone, the white, standard version of it was sold out, so I was forced to purchase the titanium version of it. Aside from the color, they're the exact same phone. Not too big of an issue, I guess.After having the Galaxy S2 for a bit, I can honestly say that this is the best phone I've ever owned(inb4 \"iPhones are the bestest!!1!\") No, they are not. I own the latest generations of iPad and iPod Touch and I can honestly say that I hate the iOS platform with the burning, fiery passion of a thousand suns. But that's a conversation for another time.I've owned several phones while being a member of Virgin Mobile - The Samsung Intercept, Motorola Triumph, Kyocera Rise, HTC EVO V, and now the Samsung Galaxy S2.Since I've had it, not once have I had an issue with the battery draining rapidly, the screen ALWAYS moves as quickly as I swipe it with no input lag. This thing is basically--as numerous reviews I've seen say--a mini supercomputer. Plus since Jelly Bean is now out for the Virgin Mobile of the Galaxy S2, the phone is even better than it was before. What more could I ask for, aside from it turning into a Transformer and assisting me in taking over Earth?I would definitely HIGHLY recommend this phone to those who are looking to purchase, especially if you're as tired as I was of scouring all over the place for the perfect Virgin Mobile phone.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best at Virgin...so far", "Author": "L.

Had to call Virgin customer support. The rep was professional and quick. Five minutes about all it took to get the activation completed. All my contacts and other android stuff was soon available.The SII screen is wonderful, the extra real estate makes a huge difference. Have to reconsider getting a Kindle now, the kindle app renders content so clear, can hardly see needing another device to read ebooks on.Still only a few days into owning this thing and my only complaints, so far, is the spottiness of the 4G coverage.

I purshased this phone because I could not afford the samsung galaxy Note2, but it has almost the same features except the note app (of course!). But I could live without at the moment.I loved it the first days, large screen, nice picture quality (except the self-pictures where the resolution is weak). Later on I figured out that the sound quality was not as good as with my old HTC on the highway.Overall really easy to use. I hate texting on small keyboards but the swipe functionality has given me the love of writing (text, emails) on my smartphone more than on my laptop now (hope we will have soon that feature on laptop). Anyway I love the design, the smooth navigation.You will dislike the short battery life if you do nothing against it. In the beginning I had to charge my phone twice a day with minimal use of the phone, despite the power saving on. Then I figured out that once you disable the automatic update of apps, reduce the brightness of the screen to his minimal and few more features, you can save a lot of battery power. Just try what may work best for you. Today I spent about 2 hours on the phone and at the end of the day still have about 1/3 of the battery left.You may find your phone shutting down/rebooting of its own, even though you don't need to recharge battery. The power on button will not work. The only option may be to open it, remove the battery and then power on the phone. It can be very frustrating since you may not know that your phone is turned off. This happen to me few times and it seems like it goes together with the automatic update of apps, some apps requiring a reboot of the system. Now I have  cleared the cache and disable the automatic update of apps, and think that it works, but time will let me know if I was right...I would have given 5 stars, but for all the above frustrations  I went through, I give only 3 stars now..until my next review.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like the phone", "Author": "Moses", "ReviewID": "R14YMVNMKGEJT8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really enjoying the Samsung Galaxy S II 4G.

With a relatively light weight and slim profile, it fits nicely in my pocket.  The glass touch screen delivers a vibrant display, and optional live backgrounds add to a modern, attractive aesthetic.  The screen transitions/slides are sleek and enjoyable, and it took me very little time to learn the ins and outs of the OS (which is Android's Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0).The camera is excellent, taking finely detailed pictures and with some pretty smart focusing options.  I'd like more control over the white balance, but honestly, the quality of the pictures the phone takes make the biggest difference between it and a higher end, consumer-grade camera how much outside-the-box thinking you have to do to get a good shot- and there's not much needed.  If your pictures should need any extra lighting, there's a nice flash on the phone, but it gets more mileage from my flashlight app than it does from the camera.  In short, this phone takes excellent pictures.  If you're photographically inclined, and don't like carrying more than one electronic device with you, this phone is definitely for you.Its sound recording abilities are surprising, too.  I've recently started work on a self-produced voice acting demo, applying my college studies of audio recording and sound for picture to make it sound professional, and this phone has been instrumental in recording foley on the go.  Sure, it's not a thousand dollar condenser microphone, by any stretch, but it does its job in a pinch, and the sounds I've recorded (outdoor background noise, the kicking/throwing/dropping of auto body parts found in a body shop dump, etc.) are high-fidelity enough to lend to the professionalism of my demo without burning such a hole in my pocket that I'm no longer presentable.Oh yeah, phone features.  I was rather wary of buying a phone without buttons, as I text more than I talk, but this phone honestly has the best smart text entry system I've seen yet: you can actually enter words by tracing a line from letter to letter, and about 95% of the time, the text entry program guesses the words correctly.  No need to lift your finger from the screen- even when my line's direction is questionable, I still get less typos than I've had with any other smart text entry system.  Thanks to this system, coupled with the Inkpad Notepad app, my little Moleskine notebook (of comparable size to the phone, but thicker) gets much less use; this system is almost as quick as writing by hand, and easier since it can be done on the one multipurpose device I carry in my pocket.Browsing the web is about as easy as it gets on a phone (granted, my experience is limited with this; this is my first data plan, so take this with a grain of salt, if you must): quick, with easy panning, scrolling and zooming.  Image viewing is expectably great, given the high quality of the display.  My complaints largely have to do with Virgin Mobile and the reception I get.  It's certainly not intolerable; I can make/receive calls and text just about anywhere, although I've had some experience with dropped calls when they've gone on for twenty minutes or so- although such calls are rare for me, so it's not a huge deal.  Just check the 4G map before you go with 4G in mind, and be prepared for some dodgy reception on that score.  At home, I find it easier to connect via Wi-Fi with my FiOS internet than to use the 4G/3G capabilities of my phone, even though I'm still within a 4G zone (though near the edge of it, admittedly).  Still, at $35 per month (and no hidden fees, furthermore!), I can't complain too hard.I also wasn't very impressed with the music player; looks like my Zune will have a few more years of use, yet.  It organizes tracks alphabetically according to title, not even file name, much less by track number in the song's tag.  Sure, there are apps out there that'll turn your phone, with the 16 gigs you can add to its stock 16, into a bona-fide Mp3/FLAC/WMA (the latter being my format of choice, never mind the file size) player, but if my Zune already does that, I don't see any reason to bother looking for one.Before I conclude this lengthy review: battery life.  You will have to charge this daily.  Twice a day, if you use the connection optimizer (which I don't; waste of battery life, if you ask me).  That's about par for the course as far as smartphones go, but essential to include in any review.In conclusion, I'm very happy with my Galaxy S II.  It's my computer away from home, my notebook on the go, my portable microphone, my camera, and even holds some of my books, thanks to the Kindle App.  Oh yeah, and it's a fully functional telephone, too.  Honestly, I haven't even halfway plumbed the depths of this device's capabilities.  There are a few minor details that keep me from giving it a full five stars (I'd give it four and a half if I could), largely to do with Virgin Mobile's service (although $35 a month is quite reasonable, considering unlimited 3G and 2.5GB of 4G/month), but on the whole, if, like me, you're one of those people with top-shelf tastes and a happy hour budget, this phone is definitely for you.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy s2", "Author": "Tae", "ReviewID": "R2G6WUEA8LRYJD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the Samsung Gaxlaxy s2.

RAFE", "ReviewID": "R3O98A6CGWNKM4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd Android phone after an ancient LG Optimus V and a more recent LG Optimus L9 (also prepaid on T-Mobile).  I really liked the higher resolution L9, but T-Mobile's data network is hit-or-miss in Toledo (and gone complete outside of town).  So I'm back to Virgin Mobile (not the fastest data, but the coverage is good, consistent, and the $35 a month plan is a good value for me), with a new Samsung Galaxy S II 4G in Toledo, OH.  Here are some of my initial observations:According to all the the little blurbs at VM, we can \"browse the web at lightning fast 4G speeds\"; that would be true if Sprint had their WiMax everywhere.  Too bad it's not in Toledo (nor is likely ever to be deployed, as it is obsolete technology).  The other problem with all the 4G hype is that the Touchwiz notification toggle is set up for 4G, rather than just mobile data.  Toggle on 4G in a non-WiMax market and it looks for a bit, then gives up, without toggling data.  To start/stop 3G data, you have to toggle it manually in the Mobile Network Settings menu (or install an ugly widget that doesn't match anything else on the home screen).  The L9 let me customize this toggle, the Samsung doesn't.  Big Fail.The blurbs also mentions that we'll \"see every detail on the massive 4.52\" touchscreen\".  Sure, but the resolution is only 800x480 -- great if your eyesight isn't very good.  Otherwise, the screen looks like a child's toy.  qHD (900x560) would have been more appropriate for the screen size (e.g., on the L9).I'm finding I don't care for the hard-to-see capacitive only buttons on the front face -- I'm used to having a physical Home button on the front face for (1) orientation, and (2) turning the screen back on quickly, say, to check the time or an incoming message (here, we're left only with the side Power button to do this).  Fail.WiFi seems a little iffy on the device.  All of our other mobile devices (phones, tablets, etc.) connect with our SOHO AP just fine in every part of our frame house.  The Galaxy S2 has trouble even seeing the AP at times when other devices are already connected & reporting a Good signal.  Fail.The Samsung overlay to Andoid is ugly (in my opinion), and there's not much to do about it.  As I noted above, the Touchwiz notification toggle is nice, but the data toggle is useless if 4G is unavailable.  Upgrading the phone to Jelly Bean helps alittle in this regard, but not enough.  Fix that, and I would bump up the rating by a star.  Fail.Oh, and Samsung doesn't include Google's Genie widget for news & weather updates.  Another Fail.Battery life is also a potential problem area on the Galaxy S2.  The standard 1800 mAh Li-Ion battery is under powered for the device.  Prepare to spend some time looking for ways to make it through the day if you use lots of WiFi & data.So, why did I get this phone?  Mostly due to its size (fits in a shirt pocket, the L9 fit better, though) & feature set (CPU, RAM, OS, etc.) compared to VM's other Android device offerings.  When VM offers a decent 4G LTE device (Sprint's 4G technology going forward), I'll probably give that a try.  In the meantime, I'll make due with the Galaxy S2 4G (NOT!).", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "P.

I change phones all the time(I bore easily) anyway, The Samsung Galaxy line of phones is by far my favorite, though I do wish they made a beefed up version of the LG Optimus V, That's a great phone too. Anyway, The S3 this ain't, but a Very close call in my opinion. The 5mp camera is not bad and actually takes a fairly good picture.  With it's display and layout on the settings, it is a very well functioning Menu layout. . As always I suggest a case for this as the phone is thing and slippery. Also, the usual Memory card as well. I know some of these phones can take a hefty SD Mini card but I usually stick to around a 16gb and I'm happy. I have put a lot of apps on this phone and have not had a storage problem. I rock back and forth between my Virgin Mobile Supreme, Galaxy Ring, Galaxy Reverb and the Galaxy Victory. I also have an HTC Vone and my reliable Optimus V with an extended battery.

I have had constant issues with its ability to communicate properly with the towers.

I have communicated with Virgin about this without a great solution besides changing the settings to not get this info from the towers. I also found that the screen cracked easily and I realize I should have gotten the insurance. It has not been a real issue though.One important thing to understand is that the battery life is not great. It helps if you close out the programs by holding down the home button and then choosing which to close, but it still never gets me through a day.

I loved it, except that after one month, the phone died. So I was offered a \"refurbished\" phone as the replacement, which I did not find fair (this is apparently standard practice), except the manager (was the 5th person in contact) was apologetic and gave me a few more incentives.Aside from this experience, I will give more details about the second phone. It is 3G/4G, which means, if it is available in your area, wherever you are at the moment, you will get 4G service. You can tell by the icon at the top of the cell display. I was able to get my personal e-mail activated pretty quickly. I'm not an expert in electronics, like my husband (who has way more reviews BTW), but this was easy enough to do (I was walked through with my IT guy at work, with my previous cell phone, prevail). Google and all my contacts were pretty easy to transfer, too. The Apps are very easy to download and use; many are free, as well.  My favorite Apps are: facebook, ebay, & yelp. I love the camera, and it takes pretty good pics if your subjects are still. The video capability is pretty good too. The gallery is pretty easy to navigate too. I had to play with my phone to familiarize myself after reading the basic guide book (very basic BTW). Once you are familiar, it is pretty easy to navigate as a user. Also, I've dropped my cell many times, but it has held up pretty well. (I had a blackberry some years ago, and the ball kept breaking.) Few issues with dropped calls (service with carrier is pretty good).Here are the down sides: (1) Cell Battery is VERY low- I have to recharge my phone twice a day. I looked it up, and apparently, many other users have this same problem; maybe too many apps are in use, I don't know. This is at times frustrating.(2) The touch screen is a bit touchy; you can easily swipe the wrong thing. (3) Sometimes my cell phone flashes (ie. goes from something to another without me touching or swiping it) from time to time. Though the 1st cell did that more frequently, before it died.So, in summary, many Pros, rather than Cons. I really like this phone.

I've always been extremely happy with their service.A couple of years ago, I upgraded from a \"pay as you go\" plan to a basic smartphone and a data plan at $35/mo. The phone I got at the time was okay...it functioned, in other words, but it definitely wasn't a show stopper.I've been saving up and planned to purchase an iPhone for my plan once I had the capital to do so; however, my previous phone had other plans and decided to die on me. I needed to replace it, quickly! I decided I didn't want to just buy a \"bandaid\" phone; I wanted to get something I could afford now that would offer a significant performance increase over my current model (LG Optimus V).I did some research and decided to try and find the Samsung Galaxy S2. Luckily, I found that it was in stock at a retailer (out of stock from Virgin Mobile itself, though) and it was on sale.I picked up the phone, activated it, and immediately was impressed. Apps run smoothly, the phone is quick and responsive, 4G is incredibly fast compared to my previous phone's 3G, it's got a lot of memory. I've now had the phone for about a week and here is what I have found:PROS:1) Memory - over 1 GB of internal memory, plus a micro SD slot that can take up to a 32 GB card. Fantastic! This phone also allows me to move a lot more apps over to the SD card than my previous phone did, so I've already got a lot of content and apps, but I'm hardly using my internal memory at all.2) Camera - 8 MB camera with flash is really fantastic! It takes high quality photos. I'm really enjoying that a lot!3) Ease of navigation - easy, responsive touch screen; everything flows smoothly.4) Connectivity - 4G is super fast, 3G works well when 4G is unavailable, and WiFi works smoothly. Can also use as a WiFi hotspot!5) Easy to activate and set up. By far, this was the smoothest/easiest Virgin phone I've activated.CONS:It's kind of large. That's the only con I can find. And it's not even that big of a deal, but it is taking some getting used to. It feels more like a very small tablet than a phone. But I don't mind because it's such a fantastic piece of equipment overall.I'm very happy with this phone and would definitely recommend it.

I take a vitamin called Tripleflex. It has MSM, Glucosamine, and, Chondroitin. I never cared about vitamins, until I had to do something, just to type pain free. No, I don't work for any company. I wished I did, By pressing the little microphone on the front page of my Galaxy S ll, I can speak my searches into the Google Search text field. I search for EVERYTHING! How to... when is... on this day, bla bla bla. That is only the beginning. Really, I don't talk much on a phone. The final reason that helped me decide to get this phone, and, plan, is that together, it is perfect. Affordability is a main attraction, with like a special present forever as a bonus. It's hard to explain. I guess, I really knew for sure I was missing out, after I had this Galaxy S2 for just a couple minutes. If you need a handheld state of the art, fully functionable, that never drops calls, well, try this Samsung Galaxy S2 out, with the Virgin Mobile Prepay Deal!", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I would have given it a higher number if it wasn't an Android", "Author": "Chelsea", "ReviewID": "R1FUG5THE6TBZF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Lots of Google apps that I don't use and can't delete either which take a lot of the memory.That's it.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "virgin mobile is terrible", "Author": "William Cooke", "ReviewID": "R1EQ4CKEKBWI2P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is fine, but you don't want Virgin Mobile.
