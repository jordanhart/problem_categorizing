Smith \"J-Rod\"", "ReviewID": "R16P6ERC1IM4JC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a week or so of having the phone all features work.  Talk, text, web etc.  Sound doesn't seem to be an issue.  I watched a couple of youtube videos made a phone call and put the speaker phone on, it all sounds pretty good.  I bought this for my wife and I'm seriously looking at buying this phone for myself.  Light weight but seems to be well built.  Great phone for the price.  And I love that it comes with a rubber cover.  This is what I normally buy for my phones.Updated review.  I finally switched my wifes plan over to Straight Talk last night.  Seemless switch, changed APN settings and had no issues with txt, call or web.  I'll keep you updated.  Courious to see other people post about their experience with this phone.  Hopeful to see other reviews.
