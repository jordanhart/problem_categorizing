It's the perfect size- 4\" screen. I love the look of the 4.0 android OS. The phone quality though could be better. I previously had a Motorolla Milestone. The phone quality was better than the Iphone, all metal casing but it's Android 2.1 was ridiculous. Made the phone worthless. I endured it for a year and finally bought this one. Unfortunately the 4 buttons at the bottom are really flimsy. It feels like they won't work for long. The screen response when web browsing is annoying. When playing Angry Birds Star Wars, it keeps going back to pause while playing. Some pre-installed apps crash when opened. Fortunately the phone itself hasn't crashed yet. Is it better than the Motorolla Milestone I was previously using? Yes. Is this the Iphone killer? Absolutely not but it could easily have been if the hardware was of better quality and the screen had better response.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "2G Network\tGSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 3G Network\tHSDPA 900 / 2100\nDISPLAY\tType\tLED-backlit LCD, capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors Size\t480 x 854 pixels, 4.0 inches (~245 ppi pixel density) Multitouch\tYes, up to 4 fingers  \t- Timescape UI\nHSDPA, 7.2 Mbps; HSUPA, 5.76 Mbps WLAN\tWi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, DLNA, Wi-Fi hotspot Bluetooth\tYes, v2.1 with A2DP, EDR USB\tYes, microUSB v2.0\nCAMERA\tPrimary\t5 MP, 2592\u04451944 pixels, autofocus, LED flash Features\tVideo calling, touch focus, geo-tagging Video\tYes, 720p@30fps, video light Secondary\tYes, VGA\nOS\tAndroid OS, v4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) Chipset\tQualcomm MSM8255 Snapdragon CPU\t1 GHz Scorpion GPU\tAdreno 205", "Name": "Sony Xperia Neo L MT25i Black - Factory Unlocked, Android Smartphone - International Version", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41IawkboDqL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008HAEF5G"}}
