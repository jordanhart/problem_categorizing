I had to trade in my SIM card for another one at an AT&T; store because my original one didn't work, but then it went off without a hitch.Well, sort of.Now, the phone makes calls and sends/receives texts just fine. So it does what its supposed to do, no complaints there.Sadly, I found the operating system on this phone to be extremely, EXTREMELY slow right out the box. It takes maybe 3-4 seconds for the phone to respond to any keystroke. This means text messages are typed at a snail's pace. My old Nokias were easier to type on. I pretty much hate replying to text messages now.Also, I carry the phone in a pouch, but the front and the back case are already cracked. I'm usually careful with my electronics (Read: Extremely cautious), so I have no idea how it happened. Maybe the plastic is just cheap.The upsides, though? Its a totally adorable, nicely-sized Korean flip-phone. Takes decent pictures. The menus and fonts are really cute. The pre-loaded ringtones are nice. Takes MicroSD cards. You can hang cellphone charms on it. The animated LED pixel art on the front is neat. People compliment the phone. Having a pre-paid phone with no data has saved me a ton of money.Overall, its an okay phone, but I really wouldn't recommend it. I'd totally just break down and get some other device, but I'm pretty much waiting until this thing completely breaks, or maybe when the iPhone 5 is out.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "MinaSaki", "ReviewID": "R2B6WC8LZ7PXSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi!
