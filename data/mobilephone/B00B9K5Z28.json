Haven't been able to do either in the month that I've had it - no matter where I am. Internet connections are pretty spotty in my apartment building, but I can't get a connection on this phone anywhere, period. I also can't receive texts on it, which I'd read you could do.The sound quality is pretty bad. Sound quality is very important to me, so I would not recommend this phone on that score. As much as I hated the Event, it did sound good.I want another Android (my main problem with the Event was that it couldn't seem to understand that its primary job was to make PHONE CALLS, but I do like Androids overall), so the minute I get one, the Brio is toast. Overall, use it as a temporary phone. I haven't even bothered putting all my contacts in it.

I don't use my phone very much.But if your looking for a phone you can get and be using the same day. Virgin Mobile mightnot be the carrier for you.I'll check back when and if I am able to activate the phone.Update: 4/1/13Today they called and enabled my service. They didn't transfer the amount of money I had in the accountuntil I called them to tell them about it. I was on the minute2minute plan with my old phone and afterasking them to check several times they verbally assured me that I wasn't on the PayLo plan and that I wasstill on minute2minute, though the Virgin website still says I'm on Paylo.

In order to force existing customers to a new plan, they no longer let minute2minute users switch phones. I tried to swap phones online and was told to change to a new plan first. I called customer service and spoke with a live rep. She confirmed that there are no phones I can switch to and still keep my minute2minute plan.Prior to buying this phone, I checked VM's website and found that minute2minute users could use pay lo phones. This is no longer the case. I will be changing to Tracfone when I do need a new phone, because they have a plan that suits my needs.Update 9/3/13 A VM customer who purchased the phone after I did was able to keep the minute to minute plan. Maybe VM changed their policy back in order to keep these customers. It was too late for me, I've switched companies already.
