My only complaint (if it really is) is that being a serious amatuer photographer the camera isn't required or needed.  Other than that it's already recieved the first drop test and passed with flying colors. The bonus is the battery life, I can go beyond 10 days with no problem at all and at my age I'll probably die before it does.  They say you get what you pay for and in this case it's certainly very true.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Raymond Dorrell", "ReviewID": "R20L4BQVA6A5T3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Real nice cell phone...

Shere \"Bent on Benz\"", "ReviewID": "R26TKITJ1AWS6X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very unreliable construction, make sure your sold a phone by someone authorized so you can get warranty repair; My GPS doesn't work anymore, the screen scratches with Bic lighters easily, and randomly will require the entry of your 4-digit code several times a week or go for months without the problem (fun). What's good is that it last weeks without a charge, is loud and easy to hear ring, and bright too if you need that. The fourth and last perk of this phone is that you do not have to pay for incoming sms messages with your pre-paid service. Yes, it scrolls the message slowly or you can open it entirely but that's up to you. My Sonim has been well kept, I don't smoke, drink or speed around in a work truck; the phone rests calmly in a pocket or on my sailboat where needed the most. Any phone with an FM radio is likely made by Chang Jiang factory. Imagine enjoying a whole day of no phone calls to find out that your indestructible phone's operating system needed to be reset for unknown hours... I highly recommend another IP67 solution with the addition of a silicon (Otterbox/Pelican) case. You may not want to hear what I have to say, but my $20 Walmart Net10 phone was more reliable.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Sonim XP3 Quest Pro Ultra-Rugged Cell Phone (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41a4BC7LtbL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006BAE1OE"}}
