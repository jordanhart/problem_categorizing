{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Using in Brazil - Wonderful but bigger than I thought", "Author": "Daniela C. Matielo", "ReviewID": "R1WXXZ079N41OT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well, I have been dreaming to buy one of this for quite a while: researched, compared, did a lot of pros and cons and finally decided I would go for the Galaxy Tab. What made take the decision was: the outside design - I thought about buy Asus transformer but reviews said it was not so elegant. I was considering buying it also because of the extra battery keyboard, but friends conviced me that I would hardly need more than 9 hours of working on it. Also, I wanted a 3G gadget, which this one does wonderfully.There are a lot of interesting applications in the market and I am quite content with it, overall. But I must say that 1) It actually could be a bit smaller: it is bigger than a book, and that makes it difficult to hold while eating, for example (ok, you may say it is not healthy to read while having lunch, but then again, this is my review ;). 2) I do miss having more battery. Because sometimes I forget to charge it at night and find myself without battery during the day.I am happy I bought it 3G though - I was afraid it wouldn't work with a normal SIM card but it actually worked pretty well, just out of the box. And because there are several places here that you don't have wi-fi, it is useful to have a tablet that can connect to internet no matter where you are. I did not give it 5 stars because of my own frustation and not because of the tablet. Hope this is useful.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Comparing to iPad and using it in Brasil...", "Author": "Flavio Levi Moreira", "ReviewID": "R1S4GS8ETW4L00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't go over the details that everyone knows... tech Specs, design, etc...SYNC WITH THE GALAXY S and COMPUTER:I have a GalaxyS Smartphone. Once I took the SGT out of the the box, I just needed to login on my market account and the SGT donwloaded all the apps available for the TAB.When I connected it with my laptop, I just manage the files in it as if it was a Storage device. Added music, books, pics, and the SGT did the rest of the job organizing the files in its programs.TOUCH:The system and the touchscreen response are sometimes slower then the iPAD, but the fact that you can customize the screens and that you have lots of shortcuts gives you a more efficient handling of the device.WORKING WITH IT:I've oppened office documents on the POLARIS (come along and free software) and edited some excel files. Works great.I also visited lots of website, with full acces to all it content (java and flash).I Recommend the Tab for those who like to customize, use widgets and shortcuts... If you want a simple to use (but limited device), go for an iPAD.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beware Worldwide Distributing!!", "Author": "lgn135", "ReviewID": "R20QPAXN7B0JJI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tab was purchases as a Christmas gift through Amazon and arrived quickly with their usual great customer service.

We were able to switch to English but upon taking the tab to AT&T; for activation, they were unable to connect it.I called  Worldwide and they said to call Samsung, it was not their problem. Upon calling Samsung I learned that the 7500 is an INTERNATIONAL tablet sold in India and tha I would have to call India's customer service as the US only helps with the 7510. Upon calling Worldwide again and expressing my dissatisfaction (and, no, they won't accept returns because it has been opened - uhh, how else do you use it???) they said that I was correct that it was not expressly listed as an international tablet on the Amazon website but that I should have researched it further and made sure that I was buying a US model (7510) not the international model (7500).Thanks Worldwide - you've been a great help!

The hardware is polished but the operating system is very limited and buggy.Critically bad: I bought the Galaxy tab and used it for a year in the US. I moved to Brazil and the tablet started showing the well-known \"oil slick\"/\"newton ring\" problem. After 3 months, the motherboard became defective (similar to this problem: [...]) and it cannot be replaced by Samsung Brazil. In the US, service without warranty charges almost the price of a new tablet (not counting the replacement part costs). Additionally, Android Honeycomb was always buggy (especially the email/text-writing tools).

In all fairness the Ipad3 is a third generation product where as the Galaxy is a first generation tablet from Samsung. But the biggest quirk especially with the honey comb operating system is the responsiveness ... it lags at times even when switching screens on the home screen. It just does not feel as fluid as the ipad 3. I believe they corrected this with the new tab 2 (when I tried it out in the store)My personal recommendation is to buy the new tab 2 instead of this one. Even though the price maybe a bit lower, you will be pulling your hair out especially if you are used to the fluid touch screen responsiveness of an ipad. The new tab definitely improves on this one point (I believe the new operating system has to do with this, not just hardware alone)", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Value for Money", "Author": "Muruga Hari", "ReviewID": "R17VZUU5P0CY26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this Tablet for my Uncle who lives in India.

I purchased an unlocked GT-P7500 from Amazon.com and here are the lessons I learnt --1.If you call up any US GSM cellular provider to ask for sim for the unlocked tablet it would be very difficult to convince them about what you want. They do not know the world outside their locked/contract devices.2. You do not get to update to the latest version of Android for unlocked versions.3. The device may not be hard wired/ hard coded to make it appear as a US device. The location is hard wired in the device and they is no setting in an Android device to change the location.

I would never regret it. It is better than the I pad. I feel sorry for those technology idiots who don't get this. Even a 14 year old  would know to do their research.BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE TABLET GET THE GALAXY TAB. IT IS THE BEST TABLET EVER.
