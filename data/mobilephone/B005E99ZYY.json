I have used the phone for almost 2 weeks and the screen works perfect without a problem. The build quality of the phone is excellent, made out of a high quality plastic. Battery life is around 3-4 days with 2 hours of talking per day, that is also nice. For the price it's a deal breaker. it's not a smartphone but it's perfect for texting messages. I would recommend this phone for those who want a simple phone with all the basic functions that has a qwerty key pad, it's stylish and not expensive!", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Daughter's cellphone", "Author": "Kristi", "ReviewID": "RNJTCACAE7JOV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "She really likes her new phone.

It is a nice size, wifi capable and has a slide out keyboard. Great now on to the problems.- I have only had this phone 4 months, I don't have bluetooth or wifi on, and it will only stay charged ONE day.  I have to charge this phone at least once a day, more if I actually use it.- The keyguard will unlock if the keyboard is slid out even a little.  This is bad if you keep it in your pocket, it will butt dial A LOT.- You cannot use a stylus, and the tiny screen makes it hard to click on tiny links that are right above one another.- Camera switches to video to easily. You can miss great shots by not realizing it is set to video.- Sensitivity.  Hard to scan through contacts and menus.  It will open menus when you try to scan through.  Sometimes it's really sensitive, other times you are practically pounding on the screen to get something to open.I started to not like this phone just a couple weeks after I bought it, and can't find anything I do like.  I had hopes that it might finally make me happy, but no luck.", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony Ericsson TXT PRO", "Author": "kellyinca310", "ReviewID": "R20K0U99Q0PW5Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my daughter so I wouldn't have to renew another contract for two more years from AT&T.;  I was disappointed to learn after I purchased it that you can take and send pics from this phone, but cannot view pics sent to you via text.  If you have a teenager, you know how important this feature is!  After having the phone only a month, the phone started having issues and would not allow you to retrieve any text messages at all.  Even after turning power on and off several times, hoping to \"reset\" the phone, the problem persists.  At $125, I hoped for a phone that would work longer than a month!

Instead, it is designed for kids, especially for girls at age under 12. BTW, I bought the phone for my 10 yr. daughter.Now, let's get into the worst part. I bought the phone from newegg, not from Amazon. My daughter used the phone for about a week, and told me the touch screen didn't work in half of the time. You can ONLY use the touch screen to make a call, answer a call, or terminate a call. If the touch screen doesn't work, the phone is useless. You have to turn off power to terminate a call. I did try to calibrated the phone [...]I contacted Newegg customer service, and was told the phone was defected and could be returned for refund, but I needed to contact Sony Ericsson to create a case #, and then they could work on the refund. I called Sony Ericsson at 866-766-9374 on 09/30/2011 Friday afternoon around 4:00PM CST. A woman answered the phone. First she took all my personal info; phone #, cell #, address, and e-mail address, and then asked me the phone info and what was wrong. I told her what was wrong, and the seller asked me to contact Sony Ericsson to create a case # for refund. After I said that, the woman immediately said, sorry can't do that, the system is down. Then I said, Ok, since you got all my info, phone # and e-mail, when the system is up, can you call me back? The woman became mad, and very rudely said \"sir, I am telling you again, the system is down, I don't know when it will be back, it could be 5 or 10 minutes, or maybe next week (What hack is that, next week???.)\". Give me a break!  I have never had experiences like Sony Ericsson Customer services. The people who work there are trained to lie, not to solve problems. Their people just like their product!!!SONY ERICSSON WILL RIP YOU OFF. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "This phone should never have been created... unless you're under 16 years of age.", "Author": "Raoul Yeates \"MISH\"", "ReviewID": "R1UCGVU0L0L57T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Cellphones are like cars: There are MANY, many ones that come out every year; many have great features in different sizes and fits different purposes. Then there are some that you just have to ask: \"What were they thinking?\"The Txt Pro falls undisputedly in the latter. This phone is like those really cheap cars that you give your teenager to drive, so they could wreck it and you don't have to empty your pockets trying to make some semblance of the situation. Now I have been a fan of Sony Ericsson for many years... EVEN after they let me down. I had a w580, a w760i and a w705a... ALL which failed within a year and a half each if so long... Of course I attibuted this to to the flappy ribbon cable that they came with.Ironically, I received this txt Pro as a present after the w705a died two days befor Christmas and my w760i one month before...I instantly hated it. It is a slide phone as well. Mind you the keyboard point of this is not bad: -if you have hands the size of an Atom Ant...-The first thing you will go completely bonkers for is just being able to get the battery door off: I pried and bent and pleaded and nothing really worked until I realised the whole thing is secured harder than a female teen living with a father in the military...That sorted, the phone has an Android system in it; the sort of type you can slide things and open things with the press of the screen, only... it isn't android. It was Sony Ericsson's attempt at their own system which I may state failed with this phone. let me state some others:- Nooooo file manager to sort out your images and categorize sound etc.- Nooooo Animated Gif support although it is stated in the specs- Nooooo proper phone setting options- Nooooo proper way to lock the phone. This one has made me prepare a bonfire to tie it to a stake; Just imagine it will auto lock in as much time as it would take you to count to ten, which then locks the screen from unwanted touching or movement in your pocket or purse, but then the phone can actually just have a SLIGHT movement of the slider point, then PRESTO! your phone is now unlocked for any unwanted screen movement. I already have SMS messaged 5 people with a picture which I didn't send.- Nooooo categorised image album, which means all camera, store pics and whatever to view will ALL be jumbled in one area.- Nooooo specific sound options: you can have a ringtone in your favorite song... that's all. No custom message sound etc.- Nooooo categorized sections for messages: so sending and receiving all is in a conversation, yet if you have 100 messages you have to delete them one by one...This phone also does not like the Blue ant S4. it works yes, but if I were to raise the volume on the handsfree, the phone starts playing music!!!! I joke not.The screen is terrible and doesn't always respond to your taps... messaging doing this manner can be a task... but then you have the keyboard... yes those mini hands could come in handy now.The Camera has no settings nor has any zoom etc.I could go on and on about the things this phone will make you pull hair you never knew you had out... but there are more important things to do in life. Sony Ericsson claimed the phone is just a base level and would not have many features... but if I'm honest, if this phone was the difference between life and death, I'd make up my mind to die... it really IS that bad. There are cheaper phones that have twice the features and better sense; - whoch this just doesn't make any.I wouldn't buy this for my child even though it hasn't been even concieved yet: I would rather buy a Nokia... and if you know me, I am not a fan of Nokia. I have used SE products for many years, but it would seem as though it is time to find another brand.Please save your non- existant hair: Do NOT purchase this phone.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible", "Author": "Jenny", "ReviewID": "R3VWIIV4Z753S5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had phone for 6 months.
