But first I received 8GB iphone instead of a 16gb but the iphone back cover read 16gb. Parts from different iphones have been assembled and sent. Returned back. Again received an other iphone which is 16gb but was not detected. The mute button was just hanging, I had to press harder the home button. Overall I had a very bad experience with this product and finally returned it. After a group conversation with amazon and seller, Seller finally refunded the amount.I will not prefer anyone to purchase iphones from this seller.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0083AFQ8A"}}
