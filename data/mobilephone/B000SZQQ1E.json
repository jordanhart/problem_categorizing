Fonnesbeck \"ejfonnse\"", "ReviewID": "RJ8OFOUG5QZ1T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone off of Amazon this past December, and I am actually very happy with the phone. Voice quality is way better than my last phone, a Nokia 6010, and people have never complained about my voice on the other side. The mp3 player on it is amazing, and it is really easy to transfer songs onto the phone, if they're mp3. It won't play WMV files or anything else, but mp3s work well. I especially like its ability to transfer files over Bluetooth, which is very quick and easy. My only minor concern with it, which is why I gave it four stars, is that there is just a little tiny wobble on the rising part when it is in the up position. Everything else is fantastic!", "Date": "January 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Right Price for an Unlocked Version", "Author": "Nathan Haug \"quicksketch\"", "ReviewID": "R209Y6NE8FHOSN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Motorola RIZR Z3 is indeed NOT as the photos depict it. The keypad includes not only the English alphabet, but also Chinese characters. I uploaded a few customer images of the phone that I received. I also received a UK-style power cord along with a US adapter. This makes no difference to me as I charge the phone by plugging it into my computer via USB. As someone that travels a lot, I thought it was nice to get the free universal power adapter.The addition of Chinese character doesn't make a difference to me. If they weren't there the English letters couldn't be any bigger anyway. I think having the keys is more of a bonus than a detractor.Regarding other reviews claiming \"some menus are in Chinese and can't be changed\", this only applies the Games that come loaded on the phone. In fact the phone I received was all in English from the first power-on (other than said games). The games are not a permanent part of the phone, they're just preloaded. You can easily delete them entirely from the phone, and since you can plug this phone into your computer via USB or use Bluetooth, you can load games of any other language by downloading them and then sending them to your phone.This phone replaced a SLVR L9 (also unlocked) that I had only shortly before I lost it. I use an AT&T; GoPhone plan, whose SIM cards work perfectly in these phones. While traveling abroad I lost the SLVR, but fortunately had removed the SIM card. After receiving this phone I popped in my old SIM card and things worked just like my old phone.This phone is also handy to have while traveling. It supports both EDGE and G3 networks; using Bluetooth I can tether with my MacBook Pro and use as modem anywhere I get cell phone service (make sure your plan has unlimited data though). It can also sync address books and calendars through Bluetooth. Even though the RIZR isn't officially supported by Apple's iSync program, you can use the additional iSync plugins package provided by Nova Media ([...]) and iSync will work fine.All in all, this has been a great phone. If it hadn't been for my GoPhone plan and use unlocked phones, I really would've been devastated by the loss of my SLVR. But with the intercompatibility  of unlocked phones, switching over was a breeze.I also had a great experience with HassleFreeCell, they were quite responsive and helpful when I accidentally used my physical address instead of my PO Box (USPS does not have local service where I live). I contacted them via Amazon and they immediately sent out the phone again to the PO Box, no additional charge. Thanks guys!", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice phone but no warranty, INTERNATIONAL VERSION", "Author": "HaSNoLo", "ReviewID": "R3KT8ZEJ1X8G5U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Haven't had a chance to really use the phone yet however it is brand new and appears to work; I did also confirm that it's unlocked by using a friend's SIM card.  However note that what I received was not a US product with a US warranty.  This was actually the International version from Hong Kong which was shipped with a big bulky charger and a US adapter.  The keys are in English and also have Chinese letters and the games that are installed are in Chinese.  I went thru the menus to make sure that they were in English and they are.  The games are really no big deal for me, I wouldn't play them anyways and the keypad still has English lettering.  I would recommened that if not listed in the description, that you email the seller first on any unlocked phone to verify if you're a getting a US product with a warranty if that's what you want. As for the phone, I can't review it too much as I haven't had time to really use it but it's definitely a good looking phone and it has 3 features I was looking for: Quadband, Bluetooth, and USB.", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Martin Escalante", "ReviewID": "R3VCFZ5ALMF871", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone some days ago and I must say I am very pleased with it. First off, I would like to point to the fact that Amazon.com sells it at a measly $107 when its original price is almost $300. True, that price was set at its release but $107 is STILL the lowest price anywhere (compared to this same phone being sold at nearly $200). Now, with regard to the phone it is one of the best purchases I've ever made. Call quality is above average. I will not say it is awesome because it's not, but it is very reliable and clear. This phone is extremely good for media. It can take unpaused video and pictures, and hhas a very decent music player. The camera can be set up to 2.0 MP and it is perfect for pictures on the go and still have great resolution on them. It even has a LED light included for pictures while in the dark. I must say though, even though the camera is awesome (it is)it doesn't perform nearly as well in places with few light. The LED light will only help if there is extremely low light, but I always find myself in a limbo between not enough light for a picture without flash and not enough darkness for a picture with flash. Despite that, I still find myself constantly taking pictures XD. Another cool feature is the fact you can increase the memory storage by adding a 2 GB SD card. I bought mine with the phone and find it perfect for lots of music and pictures. Overall, a great purchase. If you are looking to buy a great phone which is very cheap, look no further. If that still doesn't convince you think about this: it is unlocked AND ready for amazon prime shipping. That was a deal maker for me :D. Enjoy!!", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Slider", "Author": "Joel & Tessi", "ReviewID": "RIFUR4CIDCOIP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS:  As I write this review, QuickTime Pro is in the background converting episodes of The Office to MPEG-4 to watch on my new RIZR (yes, it works beautifully).  I bought a 2Gb microSD card as well so I've got plenty of storage available.  I'm THRILLED that I didn't have to sign up for another 2 years with at&t.;  I own a Mac, and SallingClicker (Google it) works flawlessly as a remote control for the computer.CONS:  One thing that frustrated me at first is that you can't assign ringtones to people in your address book if you have them stored on your SIM card - but the phone allows you to select them all and move them to your phone (took about a minute to move 250+ contacts for me).  Reception isn't quite as good as I'd hoped, but I think it's better than my last phone (a free phone from at&t;).  Menus take some getting used to, but I hear all Motorola's are that way.All in all, thank you for a great new phone!", "Date": "February 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "CigarGuy79 \"\"Everyone should believe in s...", "ReviewID": "R24ZIZ7M90ZL2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to use on the AT&T; network, after talking with different representatives they told me that not all the features would work on their network, well I messed around with it for about 20 minutes & got EVERY feature to work like a charm, definitely recommend this phone, it's really cool, the camera & video are really nice, no complaints at all.

The pic messages hurts more than creating my own ring tones, but other than that, I think this phone is awesome.  Even though it came with the European wall charger, it came with an adapter so it wasn't even a big deal.  Plus, you could always use that old RAZR charger laying around; works just as good.

This is by far the most expensive phone I've ever purchased and it turned out to be the least sturdy. After no more than 2 months the glue on the buttons began to wear off and the circular navigation in the middle of the phone came off. The glue spread and stuck to other parts of the phone and will not come off.The speaker phone will work about 50% of the time, other times the vibration mode won't work or if I have the ringer set to \"Loud\" it will still function as if on \"Silent\".I contacted both the company I bought the product from (not Amazon by the way) and Motorola and neither would claim responsibility and offer any form of resolution. I had to reglue the pieces back on myself (twice now) and am dealing with the in and out efficiency of the ringer and speaker.EDIT: Since all of this the phone has continued to malfunction. The camera aspect ceases to work AT ALL. And occasionally the screen will become completely pixelated and unviewable until I turn the phone on and off.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE ... there are better looking and funcitioning phones similarly priced.", "Date": "September 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beware Chinese keyboard and some menus can't be changed to english", "Author": "Dave Law \"DL\"", "ReviewID": "R3AV5N3EFXG7Y3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is not as pictured.

When I received the phone it appeared that there is no warranty (it was produced by Motorola for Hong Kong). Amazon admitted they made a mistake, but they were only sorry - I had to ship it back to the seller myself - on my own cost.

It fell off.  Why? I do not know.  I pulled it out of my pocket, and it flew off into the wind.  I suppose because the glue job was mediocre.The dirt around the screen is almost impossible to clean.

The reason I love the Z3 is because I'm really simplistic, I don't want a phone that can get on the internet or do anything else super high tech. I just want to be able to call and text friends and family. And if the phone couldn't accept picture messages, that's something pretty simple that it should be able to do, so I ended up just buying a replacement keypad for my old phone as well as a new battery and am just revamping it.But the sellers were super helpful and made the return process as painless as possible!
