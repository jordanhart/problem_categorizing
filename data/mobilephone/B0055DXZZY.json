Since I have another USB power adapter, I decided to plug it in and charge the new HTC wildfire S instead of shipping it back.  After powering up the wildfire s, I was able to change the language setting to English and then it just works just like a U.S. version.  Everything work very nicely afterward.This is a very fast cellphone come with a very nice camera.  The phone is entirely unlocked and I am able to use my T-mobile sim card with it.Nevertheless, the vendor should really indicate that this is not a U.S. version phone.I gave 5 stars for the phone but 3 stars for the vendor.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good phone at affordable price", "Author": "webid4me", "ReviewID": "R2J9RDM3J14EAG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this Wildfire S from UnlockedCellPhoneKings (Fulfilled by Amazon). Parts of this review may be related to this seller & this particular phonePhone Pros:- Android OS- Compact design- HTC sense is useful and fancy (read more about is on HTC website)Phone Cons:- Low internal memory. It claims 512MB but most of it is already used by HTC sense. User gets around 120MB of memory.- Comes pre-installed with many applications which is not easy (or impossible) to remove without rooting.Others:It was shocking to see that the phone did not had the original HTC cartoon/box. The phone was in an ordinary box and was NOT well packed. It did not even had any protective polythene sheet on it. Refer to the product photos. The handset is European vodaphone handset. But it has been unlocked & I could use T-mobile sim-card with it without any problem. Though it shows vodaphone logo on startup. It also comes with pre-installed vodaphone apps which keep running in background (& at times consume some valuable resources). These apps are not removable. The charger is also not American but the seller provided correct adapter alongside.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cool phone", "Author": "Marko Sk", "ReviewID": "R2QF5LZ5TLK0X1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's ok phone, nothing spectacular but it does its job :)It was unlocked and ready to use!

Upon arrival to Bangkok for usage, I quickly learned the handset was not data unlocked, and only voice/SMS (SIM) unlocked.  I took the handset to MBK mall and some phone ninjas were able to unlock the data piece for THB 700 (about $23USD). Afterwards, the 3G components worked fine on AIS and DTAC SIMs/plans.Not sure if this was a Thai anomaly but be warned the handset I received was not fully unlocked as advertised.  Be prepared to have a plan/time/funds in place to fully unlock the handset.  Other than this - the phone is Vodaphone with a 220V charger, and I was able to upgrade to Gingerbread 2.3.5 (via WiFi) before the ninjas hax0red it for me.  However, I feel this handset is essentially locked in at the current OS level, as the 3G unlock could possibly be removed if I upgrade the OS (unknown, but am not going to risk it at this point...)Phone is small, lightweight, easy to use, and has a good battery life.  I recommend it for those who need something when traveling overseas. Just be ready to unlock the data piece if necessary.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "HSPA 900/2100 MHz, no 3G in the USA", "Author": "francis", "ReviewID": "RP0RK99TBOCK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great little phone but it will not work on 3G in the USA.
