{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best combination of power and portability in a smartphone", "Author": "Paul M.", "ReviewID": "R1ZYNV7NOYF1DG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, a little backstory:  As of two weeks ago, I didn't know I needed this phone...hadn't even considered it.  I was reasonably happy with my GSM Galaxy Nexus.  Sure, the screen on my GN had that grating pentile \"quality,\" but it ran stock Android with aplomb.  Then, on a whim, I purchased the Nexus 7.  I was quickly enamored with its screen - both the size and quality.  Android really shines once it is freed from the sub-5 inch form factor of most phones. I started using my N7 for almost all my mobile device needs - content consumption/creation, email, SMS (look up Tablet Talk in the Play Store) - the only function it couldn't perform was calling.  I joked to my friends that if the N7 were just a little smaller and I could insert a SIM, I'd use it as my primary mobile device.  Each time I had to use my formerly beloved Galaxy Nexus, I was disappointed with the experience - the OS just felt constrained by the smaller form factor.So, after one week of being spoiled with the screen size of the Nexus 7, I knew I wanted a phone to match, hence my purchase of the Galaxy Note II.Now, on to the obligatory pros and cons:PROS- Screen Size:  If you read my intro, you'd hopefully understood the primary reason for my purchase of this phone.  After experiencing Android on the larger screened N7, I couldn't take the constrained feeling of the OS on my Galaxy Nexus.  The Note II solved that problem.  The screen size is perfect - 5.5\" really is how a modern mobile, multi-tasking OS should be experienced.- Screen Quality:  Long story short, it ain't pentile, which is a good thing.  If you've researched, you'd know it has a slightly funky RGB set-up, but bottom line:  I can't tell the set-up is any different than a standard RGB screen.  You'll like it - no, you'll love it.  Colors pop, and I cannot see pixels.  It is clearly on par with the only screen that I could ever personally compare it to:  the gold standard iPhone 4/4s.- Multi-Window Multi-Tasking:  Awesome.  Basically, Samsung allows you to split the Note II's screen into two windows, so you can have two applications running simultaneously on the screen.  For example, you could have a window on top with YouTube open, with the one on the bottom for GMail.  I've found over the past few days that my use case tends to be: top window, Chrome; bottom window, messaging.  This allows me to browse the web while quickly responding to texts.  Unfortunately, not all apps support multi-window functionality (I'd love to find an RSS reader that does, and Drive support would be awesome).  Facebook and Twitter support multi-windows, as does the aforementioned Chrome and some other apps.  As an aside, I was slightly disappointed when I initially received my Note II and discovered it was running older firmware that didn't support the multi-window functionality seen in videos.  Two days later, though, I received an OTA update that enabled it.- Touchwiz:  I was concerned when I ordered the Note II that I'd quickly tire of Touchwiz, Samsung's skinned version of Android, particularly after running stock Jelly Bean on both the Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus.  Surprisingly, I've found it actually enjoyable, with numerous tweaks that facilitate better device interaction.  Smart Stay stands out - you can enable the device so that the screen stays on if it senses you looking at it (it utilizes the front-facing camera).  Toggles in the notification bar are quite helpful - I can quickly turn on/off Bluetooth, Wifi, etc., from the notification shade.  I''ve found I've started using Blocking Mode as well - by enabling this, I can shut off notifications at night, but allow a restricted group of contacts to override the block and still reach me.- Horsepower:  The Note II *screams*.  It handles multi-window mode like a champ, takes photos quickly, installs apps virtually instantaneously, cycles through homescreens like (Project) butter.- S-Pen:  the Note II includes a stylus.  While not even close to being the primary reason I purchased the device, I've found small uses for it.  I downloaded Sketchbook Mobile to doodle (albeit poorly, but that's because of my horrid artistic skills, not because of the efficacy of the stylus), I've scribbled a few notes, etc.  I've actually found it to be quite adept at handwriting entry (the Note II transcribes your handwriting into typewritten format).  It's also incredibly quick to trace out letters on Samsung's included \"Swype\"ish keyboard.- Battery Life:  After reading early accounts of good battery life on some of the online reviews, I was cautiously optimistic that it would be the case with the device, particularly with the 3100 mAh battery.  I can tell you it is; in fact, at times the battery life is stellar.  I know some folks will give you anecdotal stories about how their phones last three days under medium use, but I have always believed that \"Screen On\" time is the best indicator of battery performance.  Using that metric (which you can find in the settings menu), the Note II gives me anywhere between 7 and 10 hours of screen time.  That is absolutely fantastic for any size smartphone, particularly one that's essentially a mini-tablet.- Battery Charging:  Samsung's smartphones (at least the ones I've owned) have notoriously charged very slowly.  The Note II is, thankfully, not cursed with this. As I write this review, it's been on the charger for a little less than one hour.  It's charged 40% in that time.  My Galaxy Nexus charged at a rate of about 25-30% an hour, which is woeful.  The Note II has a significantly larger battery than the GN, so it's charging performance is surprisingly good.- Physical Home Button:  I like having a physical home key to wake the device.  I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, but it's much easier to locate the home button on the face of the device than it is to find the small power key on the side.  *Pro-tip*:  Uncheck \"Open via the home key\" in S Voice settings.  This will eliminate the lag between pressing the home button and the corresponding navigation action back to the homescreen.  If it remains checked, there will be a slight delay between pressing the home button and returning to the homescreen (the OS is waiting for a second press of the home button to activate S Voice).  Of course, if you like S Voice (I personally don't), you may want to leave this enabled.- Pocketability:  It fits in my pocket with no issues, but this is coming from a guy who can fit the Nexus 7 into his dress khakis and cargo shorts.  I'm a little on the tall side (6' 2\"), so I'm sure that helps.- Camera:  Tons of tweaks with the onboard camera software.  Takes great pictures.  I'm no professional photographer, but it's clearly iPhone 4S+ quality and SIGNIFICANTLY better than the shooter on the Galaxy Nexus.- Speaker:  MUCH louder than the Galaxy Nexus.  I can actually hear my phone when it rings - hurray!- Notification LED:  Once you have a phone with this, you can't live without it.(update 10/9/12) - Stock Samsung Keyboard:  It's quite good, and I'm currently using it as my default input method. I prefer it's dedicated number row above the alphabetical keys.  Also, it has \"Swype\"-like functionality. I don't know if Samsung white labeled Swype's keyboard or simply built their own, but it is accurate.(update 10/17/12) - Lack of Carrier Control:  I overlooked this in my original review, but I think it's important to note that the international Note II's updates are directly controlled by Samsung.  There is no carrier interference in the software update process.  I was reminded of this today when I read that international Galaxy S3 devices are now being updated to Jelly Bean, while carrier-branded U.S. versions won't see it for months.*********CONS (this will be short)- Size for One-Handed Operation:  At times, you'll have to use two hands to use it, much more so than you would for any other phone on the market today.  My hands are larger than average, and I still have to use two hands periodically.  If two-handed operation bothers you quite a bit, don't purchase it.- Additional Multi-Window App Support (see under PROS):  It would be great if ALL apps could run under multi-windows mode - it is that useful.- Small Inconsistencies with Touchwiz:  Nothing big, just little issues here and there.  For example, you can create notes (essentially, draw) on the monthly calendar with the S-Pen (great for visually calling out an important meeting), but if you add the calendar widget to the homescreen, your drawn notes won't show on the widget.- Lack of Dedicated Multi-tasking Button:  My Galaxy Nexus has a dedicated softkey for the task switcher.  For the Note II, you have to long press the home button to bring up the task switcher.(update 10/9/12) - Capacitive Navigation Buttons Do Not Remain Backlit:  The two capacitive buttons (Menu and Back) do not remain backlit when using the device, and once they're off, they cannot be viewed (there is no visible etching). This adds an unnecessary learning curve as your muscle memory adjusts to where each key is. Also, I prefer the Back button on the left of the device's face (it is located on the right) - it would be more intuitive/logical to position it to the left of the Home key.  (update 11/19/12) You CAN enable the navigation buttons to remain backlit.  As J.A. Smithers pointed out in the comments on 11/19/12, go to  Settings --> Display -->  Touch key light duration --> (choose \"Always on\" and they will only go off when you turn the whole screen off, i.e. in standby mode).*********TL; DR:  It's an awesome phone - if you like Android, it's likely the best phone available now.  As long as having to use two hands sometimes doesn't bother you, get it.*********As an fyi, I'm running this phone on Straight Talk and consistently get download speeds in the 7mb/sec range.  I'll try to update as I continue getting settled into the phone.  Feel free to ask questions.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Must buy for busy people", "Author": "Ramzi \"Ramzi\"", "ReviewID": "R1LRQIHPA085I4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one hell of a gadget. It is the best product I currently use. The screen is simply beautiful, speed is excellent, and it feels luxurious with the glowing screen and heavy feel. I use it for all sorts of things and it never fails you. Battery is awesome, for the first few days I practically spent all day using it, testing it, downloading apps ...etc. and there's always at least 20-30% battery left at night after 16+ hours of heavy use. I happily spent 600 Euros to buy it, and that was very good value, in fact the price of this phone should not compare to other smart phones out there, as this is a different product, it truly is a phone and a tablet in one (so the alternative is buying 2 items for double the price). I am not a so-called Apple hater, but the iPhone is a toy next to this one(I used the iPhone 5 for 3 days); even the Galaxy S3 is reduced to a toy next to it. Samsung could easily sell it for additional 30% in price (at least to those who appreciate it). One comment about the size: you buy this phone specifically for its size, I wonder how some reviews mention its size as a disadvantage or a con ... how can that be when you bought it BECAUSE of its size not in spite of it? Don't hesitate about it, buy it IF you need a bigger screen. If the size to you is an obstacle then stick to the smaller ones, as this is not intended to be just another phone, it's intended to be a personal assistant, tablet, and phone. I recommend it without hesitation, and would like to thank Samsung for making such a beautiful product.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "A mighty beast, a great looker and a versatile gadget", "Author": "Paniagua Rojas Yeison G \"yeip\"", "ReviewID": "R9JNRHF0XAO4C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With this product, Samsung nailed it. I won't say it's perfect, especially because it's somehow a niche product. However it comes pretty close to perfection. It's really hard to mention all I've been able to see this far, but I can tell this thing keeps impressing me time after time, it's highly versatile and customizable.For starters, it has the same glossy finish than the Galaxy S3. On this model (the grey one) fingerprints become easily noticeable and you can't help thinking it will scratch easily. But I need to say that hiperglazed glossy finish looks awesome on this oversized phone. And by the size itself, it will impress ebverybody around, whether that's what you look for or not.The screen is amazing. Even with less pixels and a bigger screen than the original Note, the sharpness is much higher. The deep blacks of the Super AMOLED are great for watching media, playing games and drawing. It can be tricky for taking photos (color accuracy is not the best around) or displaying great white areas, which demands more power. The screen is also a tad dimmer that the one on the original Note, but that's probably beacuse of the revamped built in digitalizer. Viewing angles and sunlight visibility are quite good, as with other AMOLEDs.Buttons are on the usual positions and are easy to press. You need to be careful to not press them by accident, but I can tell you one gets used to it pretty fast. The S Pen. This S Pen feels quite better. It's bigger and more comfortable to hold and much more precise/pressure sensitive. It will allow you to do a whole load of new things. Quick pen gestures are great. You draw a custom figure to trigger one action (toggle wifi or bluetooth, look up something in the web, call/text). Taking memos, partial screenshots, scribbling has all become more enjoyable and accurate.Update: The hovering function comes handy in your mail and SMS inbox, allowing you to see more content without even opening the items (you hover the pen and content info pops up). You can also hover over web elements as you should with a mouse (hovering equals a mouseover and taping equals a click) improving the desktop like experience while browsing the web. If you got shaky hands it can be tricky, since you can easily end up touching the screen while hovering.The camera is an average 8 mpx shooter with 1080p recording, but the camera interface is now much more enjoyable now though. Battery life has been great til now.  In the end those 3100 mA really help despite the gigantic screen. Jellybean and Touchwiz combo is full of new tricks. It has a slight learning curve, but once you get to see all the features (I keep discovering them) there are many exploitable advantages over the majority of mobile OSs/Skins out there. From the news ticker on the lock screen to the way you can look up stuff with Google now or S Voice, the automatic menus that pop out when conecting the earbuds or removing the S Pen from the slot, it's all quite impressive and potentially useful.Call audio quality is crisp enough. The address book has been simplified, the text autocorrection is much more accurate. Reception isn't the greatest, but that's more a smartphone issue and quite consistent in Samsung and other brands' handsets. Reception outages occur inside certain thick walled buildings and is slightly affected by the rain. It's also true my local carrier doesn't have the best service out there. The phone itself is easier to hold than the original Note and even with a phone this big, Samsung managed to keep it pretty lighweight. I'd definitely recomend to use a case on it even if it adds some bulk (I bought a generic in the meantime, eagerly waiting for an Otterbox Defender to come out).If one handed operation or pocketability are big concerns for you (one handed operation is kinda hard even with medium-big hands like mine, but it's highly pocketable unless you use small/tight pockets), don't ditch this phone without giving it a chance. Try it at a local store and you could be surprised of all you can get in exchange for those 2 compromises.I'll be updating this review as soon as I find out more.Update: LTE! There are many people commenting about this. Apparently there's a version of the international Note 2 (not the N7100) that sports LTE, the model number is N7105 and it comes with \"LTE 700 MHz Class 17 / 2100\" (Sources: GSM Arena, Engadget and XDA forums). If you have a N7100 the LTE radio is simply not there. However this is not guarantee that the N7105 will work with AT&T;'s or Tmo's LTE, it all depends if those frequencies are compilant with those carriers' respective LTE signals. As LTE network compatibility can be a deal breaker for many people within the US, I suggest you to research very well before buying it. If someone can squeeze any info out of AT&T; or Tmo, please comment. To shed more light on this issue, you can Google the xda thread 1917383. (Geez, all this makes me feel kinda happy I don't have to worry about LTE compatibility yet).Update Oct 14th: I got my first over-the-air update today, which brought the multi tasking bar. Some selected apps (Chat On, Mail [stock], Facebook, Gallery, Chrome, Gmail, Google Talk, Web browser [stock], Google Maps, Messages, S Note, Video Player and YouTube apps) can work on split-screen mode two at a time (you can also have a resizable pop up video on top of those 2 apps). So far I'm loving this!Update Feb  19th 2014: some sour grapes. I finally got the official JB 4.3 update from Samsung after a long wait. The update rendered my phone pretty much unusable, with random restarts and crashes going on. I had around 120 apps intalled, so I figured some of them might be conflicting with the OS update. I wasn't going to uninstall 50+ apps trying to find out the problematic one(s). So after a full back up of my messages, contacts, call logs and other stuff I proceeded to a factory reset. I left the core apps I use the most and performance has been great ever since.All in all the handset itself is still awesome, but I can't say the same thing for Samsung's software support. The Note line is their top, built to excel each year's \"S\" flagship. As their highest end consumer model, they should focus on providing timely and functional updates. I know both TouchWiz and the S Pen require really specific software developments, but what came with the 4.3 update was quite short of amazing or even short of enough for that matter. Besides some cosmetic changes and Knox, it's little to nothing what was changed from 4.1.2 to 4.3. Here's hoping Samsung does a more decent job with the quality and schedule of the KitKat update confirmed today.", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Oh boy Samsung does it again.....", "Author": "Crysis Complex", "ReviewID": "R2MS7B66MT1GBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited a while to write a review on this phone, I had bought the phone right before I went on vacation out of town for 2 weeks (got it the 2nd day of release) and I am blown away by this device. I was a former owner of the iPhone 4s and then I moved to a Galaxy Note (n7000) for 6 months. I was in love with the original Galaxy Note in every way possible and then I sold my old Gnote. I felt bad because I had no idea how good the Gnote 2 would be, if I would love it or hate it. I even regretted selling the Original note. I waited for the day to come and then I bought it patiently waiting day by day (bought on ebay with square trade warranty). I never thought another phone in the world could take me away from the Gnote and then it happen...The Samsung Galaxy Note 2 came along by UPS and shattered the barriers of my expectations of how fast a phone could be and could do. Once again I sit here writing you a review of my 2 weeks of the Samsung Galaxy note 2 (n7100) This Review will mostly compare it to the Original Galaxy Note (n7000).Screen and Multimedia:We already know the screen is a whopping 5\"5 inches so I won't get into that. The HD Super AMOLED is what I want to get at. Its just so eye popping to look at every time you look at the Raw HD screen of the Galaxy Note II. Its hard to look away for even a moment. And Guess what? Its NOT PEN-TILE! Really once you look at the screen you will notice it! The screen itself is just so fun to look at and it is some serious eye candy. I know some people are worried about losing some res of the original Galaxy note but trust me this screen is far superior. It was worth losing that resolution in favor of this screen. This is truly the best screen Samsung have ever made. Period. If you was desensitize by the first Note Screen then your in luck because this one is even bigger (mainly longer) then before. Its going to be hard to go back to smaller screens after owning this phone. There was no problems with my screen at all, no dead pixels & no funny colors/bluish tint like the first Gnote. Its a breathtaking screen simply put and it is something that have to be seen. It Decodes DVIX and Xvid movies so watching on this screen is a blast with HD, Netflix also has great quality, and Slingplayer is a wonder to watch TV on the Galaxy Note II! HD wallpapers and wonderful looking on a screen like this. Gaming on this device is pure fun enjoyment every time because you will have extra room to have your thumbs moving. (played NOVA 3, Dead Trigger, Sonic CD, and a few SNES games like TMNT Turtles in time. With those games the Colors just POP! don't believe me? Try it when you get one.) The screen was so comfortable to look at I didn't even pull out my iPad on my vacation.Design / Build Quality / feel:Yes its a big phone/tablet but really it feels nice in the hand. To me it feels so much better then the Original Galaxy Note. Its something about the design of the curves on the back of the device just feels so satisfying to hold. I know the device is plastic but it some how have a premium feel to it. It is very uncanny but its beautiful and looks better then the white version IMO. The gray mixed in with a nature like feel of the GSIII just makes the front of the device very sexy. People gave me compliments on the street saying it was \"beautiful\" This mixed in with the screen can make this a very attractive phone. It is a solid feeling phone. I can fit it in my pants with no problems because the Galaxy Note 2 is thin, light and easy to hold. If your worried about texting on this thing there is an app called \"Thumb Keyboard\" in the android market that really makes it comfortable typing. To be completely honest the Stock Keyboard even feels good to type on and very responsive...might be a little tough to reach the middle of the with the stock keyboard in landscape. Other then that its a very good stock Samsung keyboard its even better when you use the S-Pen for your handwriting. This one is also better for the front of it has a notification light, I know that's not a huge bonus to some people but after owning the iPhone 3G, iPhone 3Gs, Dell Streak, Galaxy S II, iPhone 4s and a Galaxy Note...It is refreshing to see that on there for the first time. You can change the color of the Notification light as well but it depends if an app allows you to do so such as Handcent SMS.Call Quality / data speeds / GPS / Wifi:Call quality is great and Samsung made it even better then the Original note. Speaker is WAYYYYY better then the Original Note adding a \"extra volume\" button during calls. The speaker on the Gnote was not that good to say the lease. I have HSPA+ on AT&T; with Unlimited Data and the Download/upload speeds are good with my area getting 7.25 Mbps in Chicago's speed test (Using a unlocked with T-mobile USA will only get you 2G speeds). The speeds are not bad but not that good compared to today's LTE speeds. Its good enough for me though but I suggests waiting for the LTE versions of this phone if your a data speed demon. Another thing I notice with Galaxy Note 2 is that all you have to do is put the microSIM card in and your good to go. It automatically sets up the APN settings for you something that was not on the Original Galaxy note. GPS locks on fast as normal and was great using it on a vacation and Wifi is working perfectly especially with range, it pulls up web pages faster then the first note I can tell you that.Battery:It Last...the 3100 mah battery just shatters the old Gnote battery. Normal usage has gotten me over 48 hours of battery life and heavy usage gotten me about 20 hours. That is just insane....it is just insane if your not use to it which I wasn't. You would think with a screen as huge as 5\"5 inches and the power this phone has it wouldn't but it just surprise me how far smartphones have came from 2006. You won't be disappointed with the battery life in the Galaxy Note II.UI / Speed / Processor:Fluid. Fast. Quick. Speedy. Blazing. This phone is the FASTEST phone I have ever used. Why shouldn't it be with a Quad-core and 2GB of Ram. It even had me saying \"Is this really Android?\" because my first Android phone was a Dell Streak and look how far we come. I was shocked how fast this phone is. I mean every app I throw at it, it takes it down like a beast. This is the first time I felt like I didn't need to change roms or flash it. In fact I see myself keeping this phone stock for a very long time. Yes my friends I am in love with Touchwiz/Nature UX for the very first time. If this is project butter and the future of it then please give me more. The responsiveness of this device is mind blowing. Another thing this phone has is something called \"Page Buddy\" for Ex: when you plug in your headphones it takes you to a home screen of apps and widgets that you most use the headphones with. It does the same with the S-pen, Docking, and Roaming. It is another function that can activate something called \"Multi-view\" where you can have two apps open at the same time but they work so seamless. you can have Google Maps open while you text your friends the directions or you can browse the web while viewing a video. Its so smooth, I think this is where the Quad-core really shines.Its a limited amount of apps on the left side of the screen that you can use multi-view with but here is the list:Chrome (Once installed)ChatOnEmailGalleryGmailInternetMapsSNoteMessagingYou-TubeVideo PlayerGoogle TalkAPPS:Comes with a bunch of Samsung APPS which I found myself enjoying. Here are some of the ones I enjoy. Allshare play Connects to all the media file on my PC over HSPA+ or WiFi, It has DLNA that can connect to my Samsung TV, FM Radio that carriers love to take out for you to use their data, Paper artist that let you take a picture and draw wacky stuff over it, S-Voice which I admit is awful but its a decent clone of Siri on the iPhone, Music app is nice and of course all the fun Google stuff especially Google Now. Samsung Email app is good and so is their S-planner (calender) but its nothing to write home about unless your using the S-pen with the calender. The rest of Samsung's apps aren't good. (Gamer, Reader and music hubs are junk and so is the Samsung App store.)S-Pen:It works as it is suppose to and quicker then the original Galaxy note. This would be the one main reasons to buy the phone. As an artist I am very impressed with something like this and could be used as a backup Wacom mini tablet for on the go. The Samsung Galaxy Note II has some really awesome features besides drawing that take advantage of this Wacom pen. You can use it to write down notes, hover it over your video timeline to see whats going on later in the movie, You can use it as a \"mouse\" to hover over content your fingers can't really activate on the web, Write notes on your Calendar, Write notes on the back of pictures/photos, and so much more that I know I'm forgetting but it all just works with ease.Camera:Takes great pictures up to 8 MP and the best I've ever seen on a mobile device, the pictures are just so colorful. The pictures snaps fast and I love it, if you hold the camera button down it snaps up to 20 photos in a second (?) and it has Panorama which I enjoy using. HD Video recording is great and frame rate and looks very good when being played back on DLNA / Allshare. With a processor this fast its no longer you have to wait a second or two like one original note. I haven't tired using all of the features of the camera but I'm working my way to it like Low-light, HDR, Best shot, etc.Final word:I love this phone and to be honest with you I don't see myself using another phone for a very long time. This Quad-core beast can handle it all. I don't even take out my iPad anymore....I don't even feel the desire to buy the Nexus 7 at this point in time because this phone is just fun to use. This is now my personal on the go PC. I put in a 64GB microSD card into it (MicroSD slot another plus btw) and now I take all my movies and music along with me. Samsung has once again showed me that they can deliver a great product. I can't speak for updates but as far as I know the old Galaxy Note (n7000) is getting Jellybean as well so I expect the Galaxy note 2 to get updated with future Android updates as well.Get this phone if your interested, No I'm not going to call this a phone....Get this media powerhouse if you enjoy media consumption and want a phone along with it. I don't carry around my tablet anymore and I make phone calls with this thing. Its everything I wanted in a portable data device. I know some are worried how big it is but its really not that big of a phone. When you get use to it and its \"smaller\" then the Original Note making it easy to hold. Its easy for me to carry around but it is a two handed device so keep that in mind. There are ways to use it with one hand like the keyboard and calculator though. I enjoyed using this phone on my vacation and I didn't even use the unlocked Tethering ;) because the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 alone makes for a enjoyable experience to have around. I'm sure there are so many other things I am missing in this review but so far I love it. Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (n7100) is worth every single penny!I haven't used NFC yet so I can't comment on it but I would love Google wallet on this thing if I knew how to get it on there.I recommend a few apps in the play store with the note II:iMediaShare: (Ultimate app for DLNA users.)Thumb Keyboard: (Great keyboard for phones like this.)HD Widgets: (Wonderful weather widget that fits the note screen perfectly.)Sketchbook Mobile: (works great with the S-pen)Sonic CD: (Sonic with Amoled goodness will give you eye orgasms.)Google Navigation: (Perfect device for GPS!)HulloMail: (Visual Voice-mail)Slingplayer: (If you have a slingbox you will LOVE! this app, if you do not I recommend getting one.)Netflix: (For obvious reasons.)Chrome: (Great web browser)Mightytext: (If you love Texting from your PC)Samsung's Kies air: (Wireless Transferring of Music, Videos, Photos, and Texting from PC)Lock Screen 7 & Launcher 7: (Because nothing is better then making this look like a Windows Phone 7 Device from time to time)", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you expect customer service, don't buy this phone", "Author": "Angels", "ReviewID": "R26DNH8P6LB0PP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this phone from amazon back in December 2012. Initially no problems, the phone was working great, about couple months ago, when I switch cellular carries, I had to switch my sim card, and then nightmare with Samsung got started....For some reason, the phone was not reading my sim card. Initially I though, it is because of my new cellular phone carrier that the Samsung Galaxy Note II does not support, so no big deal, I can switch to another carries, however when I switch to another carrier, the phone again does not read the sim card. I though maybe the problem is simple and can be fixed without bothering Samsung Customer Service so I took it to certified repair shop and the repair shop told me that the the phone does not read the sim card and there is no way knowing why it does not read it and fixing the slot for the sim card is almost impossible as the sim card slot is integrated with the motherboard of the phone. The repair shop returned the phone back to me saying it is unfixiable. I though that the repair shop is not really experienced, anything can be repaired nowadays, so I am not worried. I took the phone to another repair shop and they said that the same thing as the first repair shop. If the phone does not read the sim card, the problem is very likely relate with the communication between sim card and the motherboard of the phone.After wasting a month or so with cellular phone repair shops, I called Samsung Customer Service. My phone was under warranty after all. It has been less then a year. Only couple months from the date of the purchase. Samsung Customer Service was very polite however said that they can not help me... I asked them why, and their answer was very puzzling. They told me that my phone is international unlock and it belongs to South Africa and I need to contact them to get it repair. I politely asked them to provide South Africa Samsung customer service phone number so I can contact them to send my phone to South Africa to get it fixed. They said they don't have their phone number but they will transfer my call to another customer service to see if I can get help. The phone did not go through...I called again....This time they transferred...I explained what happened again and new customer service rep told me that, I can not send my Samsung phone to South Africa either as they have no way of verifying if I am the original buyer. I was the original buyer from amazon.com. The product came was brand new.I tried to explain them, that this is Samsung phone and I paid close to $600, the phone is still under warranty. I would be careless if the phone came from a different country or planet, it is your phone and I need your support. They repeatedly told me that there is nothing can be done as this is an international unlock phone and USA customer service of Samsung does not support and they are unable to tell me which Samsung worldwide branch can support. Apparently calling Korea would not help me either as they said they won't help me. I literally begged them to show me a way to get this phone fixed. I can even pay for the fixing cost, but again they sincerely apologized for not being helpful. Later on, I tried different customer service rep by calling their USA number but each time I got pretty much same result and now I am trying to sell this phone on Craigslist as for parts.If phone works, no issues, I know it is a great phone however if somehow you experience the same problem as I did, do not expect any support from Samsung. For USA phones, maybe no problem to get support but international unlock Samsung Phones seems problematic to get support.

However, after reading several reviews and watching hours of reviews on you tube, I realized that this is the perfect device with capabilities of a phone with almost the size of a tablet. As a college student, I think this phone + tablet helps me to keep up with current news, my schedule, taking notes (thanks to the S-Pen), and really good multimedia features. I bought the device about 20 days ago and it arrived on time. Below I have listed some pros and cons of the device, according to my personal knowledge and experience.Pros:Call Quality is very good5.55\" Super Amoled ScreenS-PenQuad-core Processor with 2GB RamBattery lasts easily a day at leastLED Notification lightPhysical Home key buttonGood quality speakerRemovable batteryExpandable storage optionsCons:The screen quality could be a bit better because the screen is one of the main features (selling points) of this device.I realize Samsung makes most of their phones with plastic, as was the case with the SII, however, it might be time to change the material to something more appealing to the consumers.Software:The device comes out of the box with Android 4.1, and then I had an update to 4.1.1 which added the multitasking feature.Overall, the Android experience has become much smoother. (coming from the SII's Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich)Google Now is much better than S-Voice.Samsung has created one of the smoothest & fastest phones on the market as of now by combining Android software with amazing hardware.Confusions regarding this device:LTE - The international version of this device does not have LTE capabilities. However, if you were to get it under contract from AT&T;, Verizon, or U.S Cellular, then you will get LTE capabilities.Home Button Lag - There seems to be a slight lag when you press the home button. This is because, by default, the phone is expecting the user to press it again to access the S-Voice feature. The S-Voice has come a long way, but personally, I prefer Google Now. So the way to fix this lag is by----Go to Apps---Select \"S-Voice\"----Click menu button---Select Settings---then De-select \"Open via the Home key\" option. And the lag should be gone now.Capacitive button light duration - The phone by default has the capacitive light duration at either 1.5 seconds or 6 seconds. However, if you are having a hard time locating these buttons without the light, you can always change the setting under Settings---Display---\"Touch key light duration\"--then select the option you prefer.Updates - The updates are directly handled by Google and Samsung. So there is no carrier interference here. Since the Google updates their Nexus devices right away when there is an update available, I expect the unlocked version to be updated shortly after them. May be a month or two at the most. However, the carrier versions of this phone may take several months to an year or more to get updates. (Speaking from personal experience with AT&T; SII update from Gingerbread to ICS)Personal Experience:Personally, I would recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't mind the huge screen size, and the inability to do some one handed tasks. However, the pros for this device far outweigh the minor cons. Most importantly, the device makes really good quality calls and there is no issues with that (AT&T; service). One of the highlights of the phone is its battery. After I unplugged it at 7 am at 100%, then I used the phone for several calls, hundreds of texts, some you tube videos, about an hour of web browsing, played several games, Wi-Fi was on, and the screen brightness at medium, when I came back home at about 7pm, the phone still had about 70% charge remaining.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "I did not think it would be such an upgrade...", "Author": "Deusdies", "ReviewID": "R38RAE8GC4P1Y4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My title comes from the fact that the phone I owned before this one is the Galaxy S III.

I realized that the Note II had the same two things, plus it had a bigger screen so that's a plus as well.I don't have the time to leave a long interview, but I'll say this: I would use my S III for about 1 hour per day, maximum. I use my Note II at least 3 hours per day. This phone is absolutely fantastic. It's like Samsung took everything there was wrong with the S III (not that there were many things, the S III is also truly a fantastic device), fixed it, and named it Note II. The software that it comes with is astounding, the S Note application is absolutely amazing and powerful. The features that Sammy packed are just too many to count, really.Keep it short: no words can describe this device. If you're in dilemma and you're wondering if you should get it, get it.

Great screen, nice interaction, nice features, etc - until it just randomly stopped working one day. I was using it, then when I went to turn on the screen the next time, it just would not turn on and no sign of life except for a slowly flashing red LED. After doing some online search, I then discovered that this was apparently a common problem on the note 2 and, it would appear, also on the s3. I've NEVER had a phone (or any other electronic device, for that matter) die and not turn on again out of the blue, no warning or indication of problems whatsoever. I've tried all sorts of fixes suggested by different online forums, but no luck (I am an electrical engineer by training and know a few things about electronics... and no, I had not rooted the phone or done anything unusual to it.) Now I have a $600 brick!This, by itself, negates any positives of the phone. To top it off - Samsung does NOT service non-US versions of the phone in the US. I must contact a UK service support tech (on my own dime, and being 8 hours ahead of my time, does not give me a lot of call window) to see if they can do something with it. That pretty much means most of the unlocked Galaxy Note 2s you get in the US cannot be serviced in the US.

The general shape is similar with a slightly thinner and heavier body (from 0.38\" to 0.37\"- from 6.28 oz to 6.35 oz).The narrower form factor probably aims at making the device (a bit) easier to operate with one hand, as many people are highly sensitive to this characteristic in a smartphone. Now, it is possible to type with the thumb holding the Note 2 in the palm, and I have mid-sized hands. With the previous model, it is also \"possible\" but very uncomfortable, and reaching the keys at the far left of the keyboard was a challenge.The U.S version, just like the European version, gets a physical home button at the bottom of the screen, unlike the previous Galaxy Note model available in the U.S which featured exclusively touch sensitive icons for the Menu, Home, Back and Search commands. The Menu icon is placed at the left of the Home button and on the right, you will find the back icon, like on other recent Galaxy smartphones.In my opinion, the back button should always be on the left of the device, since web conventions has long established the browser back button to be on the upper left of the window. LG and HTC for example place the back icon at the left of the home command on their smartphones. This is not so important since most users will learn very quickly the placement of all commands, but some consistency would be good.Overall, the build quality of the new Galaxy Note 2 is better than the older model.Similarly to the Note 1 and the Galaxy S3, the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 chassis is enclosed in a silver frame that covers all four sides of the device. You will find the power button on the right side and the volume button on the left side. The micro USB connector is located in the middle of the bottom side with the S-Pen on its right. The  audio jack is placed at the top,on the left.The camera lens is integrated in the upper/middle of the back side with the LED flash on its left, just like on the previous model. The silver frame around the camera lens is slightly curvy, which is different from the square shaped frame on the original Note. The Galaxy S3 gets its LED on the left side of the camera, while its speaker is placed on its right. The loudspeaker on the Galaxy Note 2 features the exact same grid than the previous model, and it is placed at the exact same spot, on the back, bottom left.All the shapes used for the design language of this product are very consistent with the latest Galaxy S3 smartphone, making it a highly recognizable as part of the Galaxy brand.By introducing the phablet category, Samsung knows that it is reaching the outer-limit of what people can tolerate in terms of mobility and portability. The fact is: the average human hand size won't change for the foreseeable future. However, the Samsung Galaxy Note is also the most comfortable touch handset out there when it comes to watching movies, typing on the keyboard, or simply ready text, which is much more agreeable than it is on a 3.5\" or a 4\" display.Your experience with the Galaxy Note 2 depends on how much you like using your handset with one hand. It is clear that with a large screen, it is not possible to have a tight grip on your handset, and easily tap/slide with one hand. If you are used to do a lot of things with one hand, this may be a deal breaker. Surprisingly, this didn't bug me 90% of the time, and I was always able to make things work. On the other hand, the benefits of having a large display are omnipresent.That is the reason why Samsung puts significant efforts to improve the one-handed experience: the device is thinner and narrower than its predecessor, and, on the software side, a few features specifically designed for one-handed operation have been added. You will find One-handed operation options in the settings, that can display a smaller phone dialer and a smaller Samsung keyboard that can both be positioned either on the left or right side. You can also get a modified Samsung calculator app and the unlock pattern can be resized (although I did not find how for that last one).What's new compared to the previous Galaxy Note? (Very Good)As described in the introduction and in the specifications list, the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 has been beefed up on all sides (processor, RAM, latest version of Android) to provide top-notch performance. Just playing with it right out of the box it was easy to notice that it is way faster than its predecessor. We will review in detail the performance compared to other competitive devices in the Performance paragraph.New S-Pen Stylus (Excellent): The most significant addition of the Galaxy Note 2  is the enhancement of the S-Pen, which is also featured in the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet that we reviewed recently. The S-pen now features 1024 level of pressure sensitivity, up from 256 levels in the original Galaxy Note. The difference with the old S-Pen is huge and it feels way better, now you can modulate your strokes very subtly when you draw with any painting tool. Samsung added a few new feature to use with the S-Pen:Sliding the S-Pen out turns the display on (very good): When the Note 2 is asleep, as soon as you slide the S-Pen out of its compartment, the displays turn on, which is neat.1024 pressure sensitivity levels (excellent): The S-Pen with 1024 pressure sensitivity levels was introduced first with the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. I spent a few hours playing with it using Photoshop and it is a blast! The high sensitivity makes it feels almost like a real pen with multiple tip styles available (pen, brush ...)Battery life (very good)Overnight battery depletion: Just like its predecessor the Galaxy Note LTE, the Galaxy Note 2 battery life is very good, well the capacity has been increased from 2500mAh to 3100 mAh, it's awesome. It's not uncommon for LTE devices to lose up to 25% of their battery life overnight. Even the RAZR Maxx loses 14% of its huge 3300mAh battery overnight. But the Galaxy Note 2 LTE only loses 6% of its 3100 mAh overnight (9 hours, 4G LTE on, GPS off). That is definitely a good surprise.Intensive usage: I played a HD video for one hour and the battery dropped from 80% to 67 % - which is 13% per hour with intensive use. Knowing that battery depletion is linear we can calculate that the battery will last roughly 7 hours and 40 minutes while watching videos non-stop.Enhanced cropping with the S-Pen (interesting)On the original Galaxy Note it was possible to crop a screenshot but you had to capture it first. With the new S-Pen you can now clip images directly from any application without capturing a screenshot simply by holding the button on the S-pen and trace a line around the area you would like to clip.Then, the clipped image is displayed large on screen and it will save automatically to the clipbaord if you do not perform any action. You can always copy the clipped image to one of the four application that are displayed at the bottom of the display. The clipboard is accessible from a number of applications directly from the keyboard by holding the keyboard options button.I wish it would be possible to turn on an option to draw straight edges to the cropped area, I was not able to get a perfectly rectangular clipped picture.Enhanced S-Pen features: You can personalize your email with a handwritten signature or a drawing done with the S-Pen. In the calendar, when in month mode you can annotate or draw on important dates. In the Polaris Office app you can annotate PowerPoint documents.Airview is the brand name that Samsung gave to the hovering capability of the S-Pen: the Galaxy Note 2 can detect the S Pen even when it is held a centimeter from the screen.This particular feature can be used in different contexts in various applications: it allows to preview a thumbnail of the video from its timeline in the video player app, preview a photo gallery or preview an email just by hovering the S Pen above the screen. Airview provides a critical feature found in all computers: mouse hovering. Airview works also in a number of websites that support hovering actions (especially with Flash sites), according to Samsung, you can try it at samsung.com, porsche.com and amazon.com.CONCLUSION:The Samsung Galaxy Note 2 is one of the best 4G LTE device that we had the opportunity to test (the LG Optimus G, the iPhone 5 or the Galaxy S3 would be contenders for that title), and the combination of a large 5.5\" screen, LTE speeds and a good battery life makes this a rather unique and efficient combo.With the enhancement of the S-pen, the Galaxy Note 2 becomes a real interesting tool for creative people, it can now really be used for drawing, additionally editing photos with the S-Pen in Photoshop is a joy.I personally enjoy to use the Galaxy Note 2 as a phone that acts like a tablet, surely because I carry it in my purse. Consuming content of any kind on that device is very comfortable, whether reading a book, browsing desktop version websites or watching movies.Of course, it is up to you to decide if the large format work for you or not, but from what we've seen people either love it, or won't consider it at all, so this should to be an easy decision.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone but problem with s-pen sensitivity", "Author": "alex", "ReviewID": "R2E411N12UBNGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is incredible. i ditched Verizon and my galaxy nexus so i can finally start using unlocked phones and this one is a beast. amazing specs, super fast, awesome camera and so much more. speaking of the camera i just found out tonight you can video record in 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 speed. the resolution goes down quite a bit but its amazing it has slow mo features and i never seen that written about in any reviews i read. within 2 days i feel like the screen isnt that big anymore and it seems easy to hold in hand and use. after 2 days my s-pen started acting very weird. it was triggering a click command whenever i got close enough to the screen that the cursor would appear from hover view. i asked on XDA and found a solution if anyone ever encounters it as well. remove the button cover on the pen (i used a razor blade) and there will b 2 potentiometers. use a tiny flat head screwdriver and turn the left potentiometer slightly clockwise. like maybe just 1/8 of a turn. the s-pen is functioning  fine again. there should be an easier way to adjust the s-pen sensitivity and a documented way to to do this from Samsung. i guess mine was slightly over turned at the factory and was causing the issue. instead people wont know this and will either send their phones back for new ones or spend $30 for a new s-pen which is not cool. even with the slight problem its still the best phone out their hands down today.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "GT-N7100 Factory unlocked Galaxy Note 2", "Author": "Joseph J.

In the end she was \"I feel bad about wanting to leave apple now.\"There are idevices, TomTom devices, and Nokia devices I wish I hadn't purchased now...If only I knew this was coming!Update: 11/19/2012  Phone is still great..but the case I had purchased for it used a magnet to hold clasp down.  Thought at first ok cool.  Then I found the spen acted funny.  Could not draw a straight line from one side to the next.  The line would go strange angles on one side.  Then I removed the phone from the case and hey straight lines across the whole screen!  Keep magnets away!  I hope no permanent damage to the phone has been done.  Seems stupid design of case!  Phone awesome, separate case sucks so just warning to be careful when buying a case made for note II.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "The first \"must-have\" smartphone... ever.", "Author": "mark \"Professional Appreciator\"", "ReviewID": "R3NZZZVN6ZMHQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, the Galaxy Note II is more than just another smartphone.  It is a \"must-have workhorse\" that is the first and only smartphone to deserve this title.  Comparing other smartphones to the Note II is ridiculous... they don't compare!  The Note II is not a phone and it's not a tablet.  The Note II is a sleek and solid powerhouse that does the work of a desktop, tablet and cell phone, all in one pocket-size device.  How do you compare an iphone to that?  You don't!Size:  When I brought my Note II home and showed it to my teenage kids, no kidding, they thought I was BS-ing them that this was my new phone.  It is big -- but not too big.  Trust me on this.  It still fits in pockets, pants, shirts or otherwise.  Once I used it as my daily driver for a week I went back to my Galaxy S II and that once-great phone seemed like a toy.  This phone hits the sweet-spot first and most importantly for get-work-done screen real estate.  The less scrolling, the bigger the text, the more you see, the faster you get things done.  THIS IS HUGE! Less important but great as well is the entertainment aspect of the Note II in video viewing, internet browsing and gaming.  Again, trust me on this.  Use the Note II for a week and worries of an iPad to your ear as a phone quickly fade.  All other phones will look tiny and toy-like by comparison.Speed:  I am a power user.  There isn't a phone currently that can hold a candle to the power user experience on a Note II.  The 1.6ghz quad-core processor and 2gb ram is the first smartphone I've used (previous best was a dual-core 1.5ghz, 1gb ram) that NEVER, EVER stutters, hangs, or goes into sleep mode when you ask it to do several processor-intensive tasks simultaneously.  Stream audio, shoot photos or video, run your navigation, use your internet browser and then open a Word document all at once on any other phone and see what happens -- deep sleep, sudden reboot, freezing and so on.  NOT SO WITH THE NOTE II!  I have yet to run into an application/processor use scenario that even so much as slows down the Note II.  Amazing!Magic:  Okay, the Note II isn't magic, but it does a few things no other smartphone I've used or even know if is capable of.  First, I use internet based applications for work in my real estate business.  The Note II is the first and only phone I know of that runs EVERY web-based program I use as if I was on my laptop.  It is the first smartphone that runs large web-based programs like my Multiple Listing program, or bank REO programs in a manner that is identical to my Sony VAIO laptop.  Again, THIS IS A BIG DEAL!  There have now been a number of times I have left my laptop in my office, my Nexus 7 tablet at home, and used only my Note II for everything at work -- email, word processing, photo editing, web-based computing.  Impossible with an iPhone.Magic II:  The S-Pen seems gimmicky at first, and let's face it, Steve Jobs calling your finger the best stylus ever, was right.  But the more you use the included S-Pen and the apps that interact with it the more you realize how awesome the stylus is.  Note taking in the S-Note app is easy and simple if you want simple.  But, if you're like me and you want to max-out what a device will do, the S-Note/S-Pen learning curve is a little steep but well worth the time.  Note taking with the S-Pen/S-Note combination is like pen and paper, Photoshop, digital camera, chalkboard with eraser, and MS Word all wrapped into one steroid-charged smartphone app.  It is amazing.  S-Note alone with all of its features has replaced 10-15 of my previously most used apps.  It's Evernote, Freenote, Tasker, aCalendar+ and more, all in one.  I've honestly never been so organized thanks to Samsung's S-Note/S-Pen combination and the S-Pen interactive apps.Magic III:  (Sorry -- I'm running out of ways to explain how great and unique the Note II is.)  The S-Pen, besides how fantastic it is using the S-Note app, allows you to annotate almost everything on your smartphone.  It can take notes on your built-in calendar app, just like you do on your refrigerator calendar!  Anything you see on your screen, from a webpage, pdf file, email, photo, etc., can easily be screen-captured and then written on with the virtual pen and saved.  I can't say enough about how functional and downright awesome the S-Pen stylus is.Everything else:  The CAMERA is excellent.  HD video, built-in burst mode, HDR settings and more make the Note II camera the best smartphone camera I've ever used.  The built-in Samsung VIRTUAL KEYBOARD is excellent.  It has a swype mode.  If you've used swype you know how great it is.  The keyboard is integrated with the S-Pen allowing you to literally scribble text as it transcribes your handwriting into text, instead of using the virtual keyboard.  Again, it is awesome.  (It is the first virtual keyboard capable of replacing my once-favorite FlexT9/Dragon dictation keyboard.) The SCREEN QUALITY is great both indoors and outdoors.  It is the first smartphone you may actually want to watch Netflix and Hulu Plus content on.  The WEB BROWSER is the closest thing in a truly mobile device (try putting an iPad or Galaxy Tab 10 in you pocket) that runs the internet like my Sony laptop.  The EXTERNAL SPEAKER matches or beats many of the aftermarket mini-box speakers out there.  The audio from music and video is loud, crisp and clear on the built-in external speaker.  More: I could go on with video chat, voice recorder, Samsung photo editor, frame rates and more, but it's just more of the same awesome.Negative:  The ONLY negatives for me with the Note II are... the battery, limitations of Android 4.1 Jelly Bean and the 16gb internal memory on U.S. carrier versions of the Note II.  Others have talked up the great battery life of the Note II, but probably more than anything else spec-wise, \"great\" is a relative term.  Yes, using the Note II like a normal smartphone/iPhone/Android phone you can get more than a day's use out of the battery.  In my use-everything-all-the-time user experience I get 5-7 hours of battery on a bad day, and 10-12 hours of battery on a good day.  5-7 hrs if you're streaming video, using the camera or watching continuous video is nothing to scoff at.  It's pretty darn good.  Since I use my phone heavily all day, every day, while by no means a deal breaker, it's the most notable albeit minor negative.  There are aftermarket battery/back cover solutions that will turn the 3100mah stock battery into a 6200+mah battery.  That might work for some, but I also love how relatively light and thin the Note II is, so I carry around another fully charged spare battery in my pocket at all times.  Then there's the minor issue of Android 4.1 not allowing for app-to-sd transfer of applications -- making the 16gb version of the Note II a little sparse in terms of on-board memory.  Yes, you can use a 64gb sd card, but honestly, limiting applications to the phone's built-in memory, if you play any of the memory-intensive games (Need for Speed, Broken Sword, Modern Combat, and countless others), really is barely enough on-board memory.  Again, both memory and the ability to move large applications to the sd card are relative to the user and may not be a negative for many users.  If Samsung and Google update the Android 4.1 OS making app-to-sd transfers possible, then the 16gb version would be just fine.  Let's hope that Android update is in the works! The good news is that the Note II, as a flagship device, is certain to get updates to the OS for maybe as long as two years or so.Conclusion:  If you're thinking about getting the Galaxy Note II, but think it's too big, STOP THINKING!  GET IT!  Odds are you will never go back to your 3.5\", 4\" or 4.5\" screen smartphone again.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible !", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "RTM639Q7P3DBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When one opens the box, there is a sense of awe. People ask \"Is this really a phone\" was one reaction I got. It is an amazing piece of hardware. I have used Android devices starting from Cupcake version, used iPhone, HP Veer with webOS, Windows 7.5 HTC Titan 2. This phone is the sleekest and one of the best so far. It is fabulous!  I find the big size to be very good and not a problem at all. Will the Galaxy Note 3 be 6\" ?!The manual pdf is definitely a must read, there are lot of tips in the manual that comes in handy. For example motion based sensors are extraordinary. Closing the phone with palm silences it. Sliding palm takes a screenshot. There are several such examples. Read the manual.Out of the box, connect to wireless and get the phone logged into Google account. The advantage of Android phones is that once you are logged into Google universe, everything gets synced up especially if you have been using Android.  The position of power button is at an excellent position for your hand on this Note 2. The additional LED for notification on top is very handy. Listen Apple? The camera serves some really futuristic ideas also. It can check if you are looking at the phone and disable screen lock (even if you set timeout to say 30 sec). Also it can serve as password unlock. Amazing! These can be set from Settings Menu.The Android version as of Oct 26 2012 is Jellybean 4.1.1. Kernel version is 3.0.31-259982. Model GT-N7100. I got the 64 GB microSD card. Get this mobileUltra, it is the latest as of Oct 2012. (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging. Settings show an available space of 59.45 GB. So along with 16 GB built (system shows only around 10.46 GB), my Note 2 has 80 GB memory. With music in the  Google Music cloud, I intent to use the memory for video/pictures as a camcorder/camera.I strongly suggest going through Settings and customizing many things as per your desire. I did Voice Input, Keyboard (this comes with English(UK), change to English(US) for example. Fiddle around the settings and you will be amazed how much you can customize. I also did Battery % to appear in notification bar.One thing I found the default keyboard did not show Mic button. I realized it was next to Sym button. Long press it and choose Mic. And then on, it will appear in default keyboard. Also customize the accent. It can do magic for typing. I type paragraphs at a time effortlessly. This is Google backend servers at work. The Mic on Samsung Galaxy Note 2 does a fantastic job!S-Pen, Ah.. I was truly impressed. You have to use these to believe it. The note taking was very fluid. Samsung seem to have nailed it. I wrote up an equation in Equation mode - x^5 = x^2 + 2x + .... Something completely random, another one d/dx(an equation) and it recognized perfectly and asked it to search, it went to Wolfram Alpha and solved it. It is at first unbelievable and then it starts to sink in this is a computer program made well. Like it should be in first place! Export to pdf is very good. The main thing is the pen is very fluid and feels like a fountain pen writing.Overall, the phone feels very smooth and snappy. The screen is crisp and clear. Apps can even be multi screened. Samsung approved apps can be placed two in a screen. Eg. Maps on top and email on bottom portion. I doubt I will use this, but handy.One gripe I have with this phone is speaker is on the back. Typically if you lie the phone down, the speaker is blocked on bottom. I wish the speakers were in the side. This is a design decision and not sure why phones have speaker on back. But the speaker volume is very high, so I am not complaining too much.One big pain point with Android is once you purchased/downloaded for free Apps, they cannot be permanently deleted. So even if you get a junk app, and delete immediately they are permanently there in your Google Play store. From the phone's play store I got 300+ Apps. One cannot choose 50 apps and say get all these. You have to do one by one. After getting one, the screen resets to beginning. So I went to a computer browser and pushed apps to pone. This is easier and faster.UPDATE:  In Jelly bean, you have a circle with a / and pressing it prompts a pop up to delete. After delete it reverts to top of the list again. Why dont they go to same spot. I have hundreds, so it is a pain, nevertheless good feature. I will delete few every day!Some of apps I have as of now :Amazon MobileAndroid Status : Android Status app shows ARMv7, Max Freq 1.6 GHz, BogoMips 1592.52 Memory 1.79 GB, Free 365 MB, Internal Storage 10.46 GB Free 7.18 GB.

How refreshing - a cell phone that is a great phone.  The irony here is I bought the phone for every reason besides that and it is freaking awesome.  Web browsing, texting (Samsung allows you to squish the keyboard over towards one side making one handed operation a reality), email, media - all of these are just the best I've experienced.  Thanks to quad core processing and plenty of RAM, it's a powerhouse device.  The new iPhone 5 is remarkable until you hold it next to my new GN2 at which point you realize that yes, size does matter.  And the SGN2 has that in spades.  Overall, I love it.  And haven't really even learned all the tricks the S pen is capable of yet. Although I was on the phone today and instead of having to try to memorize a number someone gave me or frantically search for scrap paper, I pulled out the stylus, WROTE the info down quickly in real time and was done.  Oh, and it's wonderful to have voice and data simultaneously on Tmob unlike my wife's VZW iPhone 5.  Forgotten how annoying that is.But the SGN2 is just a groundbreaking device.

However, I was so over the killer bills from my carrier every month, I was willing to buy unlocked and go to another carrier who would maximize my use and minimize my cost.In purchasing, I was pleased by Worldwide Distributors, which is backed by Amazon.  I felt the risk was worth it. The phone arrived on time, in perfect condition, and was clearly new and unused. Relief! Now, to the product...I live in a family of iPhone users- I'm a Mac computer lover, but have veered off the Mac path for mobile phones. Have had several Blackberry's, a Droid Global 2, and most recently a BB 9930 which I loved for its keyboard, security and ease of use, but the screen is quite small.Enter Samsung Note 2, simply the best phone I've ever had. I was worried that I would struggle to learn it, as I'm no tech geek... but I was amazed at how simple it was to learn. (I was so worried, that I kept my other phone and number, figuring it would take a good month to get the hang of the Note 2.  Because of the urgency of my being accessible by phone for emails and calls, I did not want to take any chances.) BUT- guess what?

I now can see traveling without my heavy Mac laptop- this puppy can do it all.  With available keyboard and multifunction dock, this is truly a break-through device. I never listened to much music on my previous phones, or watched video- why bother?  The screens on prior devices were teensy and the sound quality not-so-great.  I am AMAZED at the sound quality of this phone, just from the stock headphones that come with it! The screen is a perfect size for viewing anything- no more having to zoom in. The ability to hand-write notes, cut and paste, draw, etc. is incredible.  I have not gotten into all that the S pen can do, but there are so many possibilities...The quality of the screen is A+, very clear, and although someone had suggested in a review somewhere to use movie mode for good color saturation, I kept the standard mode.  The screen is perfect for viewing TV and movies.  It is absolutely (to me, anyway,) the best of all worlds.

Big for gaming, big for videos, big for web browsing. Simply put, if you want a phone with the most real estate on the screen size, then there is no alternative. Don't be so mesmerized on the 1080p screens that will come out soon. Unless you want to destroy your eyes and use the phone from an inch away, you will not notice the difference in everyday use.2- It's fast. Yes, the Qualcomm S4 Pro quad-core beats this Tegra 3/Exynos 4 CPU in most benchmarks, but again, unless you are a hard-core geek that is OCD on numbers, you will not notice any difference in everyday use. There is no discernible lag anywhere (it's probably just your slow Internet connection).3- It's beautiful. Not HTC or Sony beautiful, but this is one sleek and stylish phone. The white is classic, but this Titanium Gray is awesome. Just check out the back cover and you will see what I mean (yes, even with that cheap-feeling plastic material).4- Did I mention the screen? It's BIG, it's bright, and it's beee-ay-eeww-ti-ful! AMOLED screens have awesome color saturation and contrast (most times even overkill, actually). Some people say it's not good in daylight. Um, have you tried cranking up the brightness??5- The Samsung/Android touch. Not everyone may like Samsung's Touchwiz user interface compiled onto Android, but I dare you to find a phone with more features than this one (and similarly the Galaxy S3). Here are the main highlights:a. Samsung utilizes the front facing camera almost to perfection. You can use it to control your music player; it has facial recognition to sense you are directly in front of the screen so it won't dim and turn off the screen (for reading, web browing, video playback, etc.); it recognizes your facial orientation so that when you are lying down sideways looking at the screen, the accelerometer will not kick in to auto-rotate the screen in the wrong orientation. That is something that has always bothered me with other phones and FINALLY someone has added that feature! Granted, not all these features work flawlessly, but it's a great start.b. Integration with Google is finally starting to show off in good ways. It was always once that Apple had the superior ecosystem. But now we see the future is bright indeed. Not just evolution, but finally innovation!c. The S Pen and all the neat things you can do with it. Preview a point in the movie before skipping to that point, and other things like going old-school back to the PDA days!6- It accepts up to a 64GB microSD card. That turned out to be the dealbreaker for me. Explanation in \"cons\" section below.Cons:1- It's BIG. With my tiny hands(hey hey), I can hardly do anything one-handed with this phone. Pocketability rating: -2. Putting it up on your face to make a phone call is also a big fail if you're sensitive to public ridicule like me. Have your Bluetooth earpiece ready.2- It's quite heavy. I really wanted to switch to the Verizon Droid DNA - for a 5-inch screen, it was remarkably svelte and light.

I looked at the Galaxy Note and thought WOW this is awesome but heard that the Note 2 was being launched soon and to wait...BEST ADVICE I had gotten - I am glad I waited!The Note 2 is FREAKING AWESOME. The screen is much brighter and whiter than the S3 without that strong blue/green hue cast to it. The phone is super responsive and Jelly Bean is just as good if not better than iOS 6 (IMHO) even my wife whom is a diehard iphone user was extremely impressed with the GN2. She thought it is too big for her use but said it was perfect for me.

I am a heavy user and have not killed it in the course of a 10 hour work day, although it was down to about 30-40%.**It can run about any video format.**Flash can be loaded but have to do a \"work around\" to do it since Adobe isn't supporting it anymore.

Scott Pope \"Scott Pope\"", "ReviewID": "R3CFSTRU7DLT9L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This past weekend, I had my first trip without a laptop computer. Not only could I leave my computer at home, I had excellent all around functionality in a single device that was on my person at all times.  Whether in my hotel room or on foot in Manhattan, I was able to realize the true power of the Note II. During the day, I was able to extensively use the Google Maps function.  At night, the large screen provided an excellent way to read text on web sites.  My one complaint is that 4G was seldom if ever available. When it was, such as at Midway airport in Chicago, I was getting 30 MB/second.*************The most important issue that any prospective customer should understand about the Note II is its size limitations are far outweighed by the benefits. Specifically, 1)it fits in a jacket or pant pockets and 2) can be operated single-handedly by someone of average height.  At the same time, the 5.5 inch screen allows for reading mainstream websites in native form.  It may look odd at first but just remember how large early mobile phones were. The Motorola DynaTAC weighed 4.3x as much as the Galaxy Note II does today. At 179 grams, it weighs 41% less than an iPad Mini and 63% more than an iPhone 5.While I love my iTunes on my iPod Nano, my extensive music library and podcast list stays with me on my iPod Nano with lanyard headphones. No iPhone can supplant this setup, especially when exercising. If I want to watch full-length video, the screen size of the Note II is worth more to me than the convenience of iTunes.  Again, the cost benefit makes sense for my use case.With GPS and mapping, a larger screen offer inherent benefits.  Yet, Google is far ahead of Apple when it comes to built-in bicycling and walking directions along with indoor navigation of large buildings.  Recently, Google embarked on Street View Trekker, which employs sophisticated navigation-surveying backpacks that their employees use to map natural wonders, such as the Grand Canyon, on foot.  Apple is WAY behind on the non-automobile navigation, which is important for many urban dwellers.On a separate note, my shopping experience with Sprint is mixed. There was no clear evidence that I purchased a phone on my account.  No confirmation email was ever sent (checked spam folder). Sprint still appears to have best data plans pricing with perhaps the lowest quality LTE network for now.  I hope the new Japanese owners inject some capital to improve the network.  Fortunately, Sprint has not forced the offensive Nascar application on Galaxy Note II owners as it did with earlier smartphones.Lastly, I am glad to see Samsung employing NFC (near field communication).  Apple and other major phone makers should have installed NFC years ago.  All research suggests the delay is due to squabbles over credit card transaction revenue.  In the future, NFC-enabled phones such as the Note II will be your car keys, house keys, credit card and transit pass.Pros:90% more screen area than iPhone 5Weighs 41% less than iPad Mini, 72% less than iPadNFC includedMicroSD slotCons:Looks strange in front jean pocketNo wireless chargingNiche applications often delayed on Android as Apple IOS given priorityTips:Order accessories ahead of time from Internet at \u00bc the price of retail", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "IF YOU WANT TO USE AT&T;, DONT BUY THE N7000 OR 7105", "Author": "robert thomas", "ReviewID": "RU8N2OACFJULM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "IF YOU WANT TO USE AT&T; SERVICE OR PREPAID GOPHONE, DONT BUY THIS OR THE 7105 AT ALL, BELOW ARE THE REASONS I FOUND OUT FROM RESEARCH AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS FROM THE SELLER1.

I dare you to try it out.  Samsung has really done a superb job of maximizing color clarity in this phone, despite its larger size.  (The best way to recognize this for yourself is to test it out.

When the 5 came out I didn't initially question its superiority untill I was talking about buying one with my upgrade to a friend and he steered me away, pointing out the lack of innovation and processing power. I decided to take a risk and go for the galaxy note 2 and I am very thankful me and my friend were able to talk before I bought the 5. The note 2 is exactly what the iphone 5 is not. It is a rebellion agaisnt the lack of innovation and risk taking that apple has sadly fallen into. First things first,  the stylus: while many would think of this as a relic from the Palm pilot era it is re designed in a way that fits more modern day tasks and its functionalities are endless. You can write a paper with it or draw a picture, but the best part of it is that it works in nearly all apps eg. Angry birds, snapchat etc. Making it a valuable tool for apps which allow you to draw with your finger. The processor speaks for itself. Its so fast you'd swear you were using a computer. This is really what the device is, a miniature computer. The claim that it is like a tablet is kind of farfetched in my opinion. It feels more like a computer/phone hybrid with a beautiful screen since you don't have the full Page size of a tablet. Onto the size; yes the thing is huge, and my friends all thought it was obnoxious and unnecessary at the get go until they got a chance to play games on it and marveled at the gorgeous screen and graphics. After a week of using it, I don't want to go back and everything else seems comically small and slow. It fits in all of my pants pockets without hassle. My favorite features are the face recognition, the s-pen hover capability and the camera, which takes incredible Pictures. Coming from an iphone I was worried about user friendliness and operating system,  a concern that quickly went away, jelly bean is awesome. It is light years ahead of ios, especially when it comes to the keyboard and customizability. I recommend this to anyone who wants something incredibly fast, versatile and fun to use.Complaints: while few,  the fact that the s pen cannot touch the buttons off screen (aka the back and menu buttons surrounding the home screen one) is a minor annoyance. Also if you own an apple computer and are used to the ease of syncing with itunes, brace yourself for some serious frustration. Not only can it not read some itunes files, if you want it to automatically sync your music (not have to worry about keeping track of which songs to add) you are esentially out of luck. A program called kies is avaliable although within 5 minutes of using it my mother warned me to watch my language which she was able to hear from the other side of the house. Avoid at all costs. The best way to do it is to just get android file transfer of of their website and make a playlist that keeps up with which songs you would like to add. Its just drag and drop from there!While I do miss the ease of syncing with the iphone 4 I used to have and that silent/ringer switch on the side, I would be very angry if I broke my note 2 and had to go back.

Not only is the screen incredibly responsive to the S-Pen, but it also does a great job converting the handwriting to text. Gone are the days of having to use special one-stroke characters to write like on older PDA's - just write something as you normally would in the text field, and use a quick right dash to space, quick left dash to backspace, a paragraph mark (like a J but starting at the top with a 90 degree angle) for a new paragraph and lots of available S-Pen gestures using the pen's button.

Very easy for my small kids to use and keep them occupied.ProsSuper fast and responsiveBig clear screenCons - None of these are deal breaks. More tiny things that Samsung would be smart to fix.Phone back cover is slippery. I have had it slide of things to the floor and almost out of my hand multiple times.Wish camera lens was in the middle of the phone instead of at end. Close to edge. It is awkward to hold a phone taking pics without getting fingers in the way.The Samsung flip case is awkward when taking pics and video as it has to hang down instead of flipped in back (as it would cover the lens). It looks kind of dorky so I removed it.Maybe need to move the microphone. Sometimes people can't hear me on a call. The phone is so big my mouth is a long way from the bottom of the case where the microphone is.Seriously. Let us remove the shutter click and video start/stop noise. I know it is illegal to turn off in some countries. But in a quiet school auditorium taking pics of my kids the sound is SUPER loud and obnoxious to the people around me!Best Shot as a camera setting is not persistent. I have to select it every time. Annoying. As it leads into the next con.High resolution leads to a LOT of blurry video (on movement) and camera pics (have to keep it SUPER still)- Best Shot works the best. Usually one of them isn't blurry.A lot of App screen option are at the top. Like Delete in email. Goofy since your thumb is nearer the bottom. Almost forces you to use two hands. This should be adjustable to bottom if you want.I can't believe this next one was missed in every design QA session. Lay the phone flat on a tabletop. Push on the right hand side with your finger. The phone rocks! It doesn't lie flat. The phone is big so i often lay it down on my desk to work on it and it rocks every time I press on it near the right side with a finger or stylus. The reason you ask? Bottom left back is a hole for the phone speaker. The bar that covers the middle of the hole in the back cover is convex instead of flat.

I no longer have to carry a notebook to school, I have the notes for four subjects on my fabulous, phablet which I ALWAYS have with me. I can cut and paste from the screen and add it to an SMS or email message; or, whilst on a call, draw directions and send it to the person I'm speaking to with just a couple of clicks.  I may sound gushy, but I love this phone!  I really don't know what I did before I had it.Apps are unending: recipes, to-do-list, shopping lists, flashlight (using the camera flash), several versions of the Bible, an office app to do spreadsheets, word processing and even power-point, dictionaries, translator, currency converter, Kindle, Skype, you name it, it's on my phone.I bought a 64GB memory card at the same time and have loaded NCIS Series 8 (over 20 shows); Suits series 1 & 2; loads of music and pictures, and around 10 full-length movies so I am never bored.I also bought a Zenus Color Point Wallet Case with it: so . . you guessed it, it's also my wallet, I no longer carry a seperate wallet, i have all my cards in it and a few dollars for cash purchases.I have even sold my iPad 2 as I found I wasn't using it anymore, I can do everything on the Note 2 (ok, the screen's amaller than the iPad, but I can still comfortably watch movies on it), AND without the case full of cards and money, it fits into my shirt pocket.My Note 2 has also replaced my internet service provider as my phone company has 4g, I just tether and use it as a hotspot with my laptop anywhere I go (I have an unlimited plan), and it's FAST, faster than my previous internet service.  Did I tell you I LOVE this phablet?Oh yes, the phone works great too. :-)  Clear as a bell, great reception, I've been using the headphones that came with it for calls as well as entertainment media as the phablet IS a little large to put to my ear.  However, the microphone on them appears to be failing (they have lasted longer than any other headphones I've ever had, I'm pretty rough on them), lately people are saying I sound faint unless I hold the mike to my mouth.Battery life is awesome, especially with Power Saving on, I've gone 3 days without charging if I don't use it as a hotspot or watch a movie (hotspot drains it FAST, even with P.Saving enabled).After 3 months I am still finding new things it can do, or that I can do on it (there's an S-Voice controller, and gesture controls which I haven't got around to using yet).If you just want to make a call, this phone is not for you as the learning curve is kinda steep (I HATED it the first week I had it as I was replacing my BB Torch which had stopped working and it took me a while to fugure out how to use my new android), but if you don't mind a pretty steep learning curve, with total satisfaction at the end of it, this is the device for you.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEST PHONE EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "SWS", "ReviewID": "R1UV9BFIQHHD83", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best phone I have ever owned.FAST, LIGHT, BIG SCREEN.

For those who have thought it would be too big, here's a big emphatic NO, IT'S NOT TOO BIG.  In fact, after 2 days of using this phone, all other phones just seem like miniature toys.I have seen the new iphones (my family members have them), but this thing blows them out of the water.  The speed with this quad core processor is great. Call quality has been wonderful so far.  And for the iphone lovers who use Siri - all I have to do is double press the home button on the bottom and the thing comes alive as my personal assistant.  It has not failed to understand any of my requests from the very first try.I have not had time to try all the features of this phone yet (there as SO many), but I certainly have been having fun trying some of them.  The video player is amazing. All the thumbnails for all your videos appear, and when you hover the S-pen over one it enlarges a bit and gives you a preview of the video with sound without actually opening it.I downloaded a couple of my favorite apps for a smartphone for watching TV.  The xfinity app installed, and now my Note 2 is a great TV with HD video.  I also have a Sling Box attached to my TV at home, and when I downloaded the slingplayer app it just installed without a hitch, and I immediately am watching on my smartphone whatever my Comcast cable box is tuned to, and I can change channels on the Comcast cable box with my Note 2.  Again, this installed and worked flawlessly.  The HD picture quality is great, and now we won't have to miss an episode of Si, Willie or Jase on Duck Dynasty wherever we are!LOL!I had been using an HTC Inspire Android phone and loved it.  Of course, this new Samsung phone is running a new version of Android (Jelly Bean), but for anyone who has any experience with Android it is a pretty intuitive experience in figuring this phone out.  I have no problems at all typing messages with this phone. In fact, I love the fact that the numbers are in a line above the letters and I don't have to change the symbols/keyboard to type in numbers or times.  The itunes apps have nothing on Android.  There are Android versions of the kids' favorite games.  There are numerous Bible apps, and I love being able to whip out my Android phone to follow along in church or Bible Study. When you are on a call or in an app and you remove the S-pen a screen for taking notes appears. That is going to be useful.If you just absolutely have to have a tiny phone that will slip into your tiny, skinny jeans pocket, this phone might not be for you, but if you want to be able to have more of the benefits of a tablet that can still be put in a pocket or won't weigh a purse down, and if you want to be able to enjoy the internet, reading articles and books, watch videos, TV and movies, then take a look at this Note 2.In just 2 days, I haven't had the opportunity to use the camera/video features yet, but I look forward to this. The Note 2 is feature-rich with the camera/video, and I look forward to trying out this burst mode and perfect shot stuff that is on there.With this phone, right there in my pocket or purse I always have a game player, TV/movie/youtube player, ipod, ereader, Bible, GPS, navigator, messenger, social networking device and assistant.  Oh, did I mention - it's a great phone for making calls. It is comfortable in my hand with talking on the device, but the speaker phone is so great I'm spending most of the time in the car talking on the speaker phone (safer, as well).Thanks, Samsung, for giving us the option of a bigger smartphone device. No, I don't want to be holding my ipad up to my ear, but this thing is fine, and I can't see myself wanting to go back to a little phone anytime soon. Now, if you are going to an amusement park, beach, rafting, skydiving, etc., you might want to think about having a smaller, cheaper little flip phone for those occasions, but during a routine day - I love this phone for whatever I do!Yep, there's a new sheriff in town - Galaxy Note 2.  Iphone will be playing catchup with all this phone does for a long time, and I can add a memory card with whatever gigs I want without having to shell out hundreds more to Apple for more memory. If the battery ever needs changing, that can be done, and I can customize the features and files on this phone to suit me.  Apparently Apple thinks one size fits all in the way of phones, but I like to be able to customize mine. I will still be using my ipad when at home, but this Note 2 will be with me wherever I go.

We all know it's huge and it's got a lot of processing power, but here are some things, good and bad, that stand out to me.The good:-Snote is  nice, it's kind of like the post it notes you can use on your pc.-Split screen feature is pretty sweet, could use more support-Navigation is stellar (not really specific to this phone, but yeah I looove it)-All the different camera options like best face are great, why don't real cameras have that?-Nice, easy to use UI. I feel like it's pretty user friendly, I love the pulldown \"notices\" menu you can use at any time to see updates, texts, missed calls etc.-Spen surprisingly good, I've never used a stylus with anything, I find myself using this all the time, for swipe, for games, for shortcuts etc.-Streaming music is a breeze-Not sure if this is a plus for everyone but this phone integrates social media incredibly wellThe bad:-Gorilla glass...supposed to be pretty strong, and I've babied this phone, yet the gorilla glass is still getting scratched up. Get a screen protector.I also have a small crack in the corner of the screen, had it in my front pocket, too tight I guess? It's just above the bottom left corner, not sure if that location is significant in any way.-Battery, started off amazing for the first couple weeks, never let it drop to the \"unsafe\" levels of charge, but I did leave it charging all night. Now, even with gps/wifi off I can drain a battery within 6hours if I'm using it off and on most of the day. I'm not sure if that's normal, but I dislike the idea of having to actually charge during the day instead of just at night. With the screen off/phone idling, it barely consumes any power at all...I guess that screen really just eats up batteries...-Svoice is counterintuitive, you can't have it set up to activate from any screen or while the screen is off. Why have a voice program if you have to physically navigate to a certain screen just to use it? At that point you're just saving 1 more navigation step. Once you're actually in it, it's actually pretty laggy...this might be the only thing my phone has experienced performance issues with...kind of weird. That aside it's marginally reliable anyways, half the time you'll get what you want, the other half you'll be typing in what you wanted to do after mucking around with svoice for a couple of minutes.All in all I'm extremely happy with this phone, it has managed to fill the role of tablet, emergency camera, and phone for me, which is exactly what I wanted.

Yes, it is a very nice looking, but too fragile for a mobile phone. I have used many phones, and normally it drops off, slips off from time to time, and I never had any a major issue with any phone. My new Galaxy Note 2 was dropped on the floor, from no more than 50cm height, and the screen was totally smashed like a low quality watch face.After a little search for a solution ( phone calls, & online), I was really surprised, when i found that it was a common problem with Galaxy Note, and Galaxy S3, even with a protection case.The company should recognize that customers purchase hardware for the service they get, handheld devices are expected to drop often, so the designers should consider this fact. or at least provide a protection case or a rubber frame for free in the box ( which will cost them less than $1).I gave only two stars, because the value of all nice functions will be of less value if i need to use the device with special extra care,worrying not to break it all the time,  or if I need to pay extra for the expensive repair(s), then the price will be too high for these functions.This is like, having an excellent expensive meal, while you have to stand on one leg to eat it.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Low quality controls, blames customers for internal mistakes.", "Author": "The Rev", "ReviewID": "R1RZO18IKEQ2LC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So 2 months ago I buy this awesome phone, then my soft key LED's stop working and the touch screen has a dead spot, so I figure I'll just send it back and they'll fix it.

My only guess is that it was messed up when it left the factory or during shipping, or during some fool at Samsung prying at the board (they did in fact chip the paint!  So I think that's totally possible), then it failed on me, and Samsung blames me for their manufacturing mistakes.  I watched the guy at the store open this device new and unpackage it, so it was not them.  Wow, great customer service.  Just do a Google search \"Samsung bad service\" and you'll see that I'm not the only one.  Buyer beware, Samsung refuses to help their customers.

I've also owned several other 'large' similarly priced smartphones, which where all great. But this one is is by far the most useful and best perfoming for many reasons. Its 3200 mah battery lasts well over 16 hours with heavy use. it is very fast and I never experience issues with freezing or lag. It has lots of options in settings to make the device perform exactly how you want it to (more than I have ever seen) I didn't think I would use the stylus much when I first got it, but it turned out to be very useful, you can hover over most things with the stylus and a dialog box will pop up with useful information and tips about whatever it is. The quick commands with the stylus make navigation quick and easy and its much simpler than I imagined it could be. The sensors on the phone are very accurate,  it knows right where the stylus is above the screen and the dot projected from the stylus follows with no lag whatsoever. The multi window feature of this phone is wonderful and not restrictive at all, you can do anything you could do in full screen in both of your smaller screens, you can quickly adjust window sizes or change applications you're using, I use this feature a lot for writing emails while getting info from the internet or watching tv while being able to send texts uninterrupted. this phone is very durable, thin, and lightweight. It fits in my front pocket (with or without otter box) and would fit in anyones back pocket it can brodcast to your tv via bluetooth. The negatives of this phone are the camera being only 8mp and it only having 2gb of ram, it uses a little over half of that on just base operation,  but I have found the rest to be sufficient for almost anything including streaming video from 2 sources at once. I like that to save battery I can set the screen to timeout at 5 seconds but also set it so it won't timeout while I'm looking at it. For laying in bed it can be set to flip the screen based on which way your looking at it instead of the orientation of the phone. The speaker is extremely loud, so loud my neighbors have called the cops on me for the noise. The screen is extremely vibrant and at full brightness will be responsible for about 35% of battery being used when using the phone heavily. The software is smooth and very user friendly, the call quality is wonderful, voices are crisp and clean. I would recommend this phone to anyone it's a good choice for not only experienced smart phone users but first time smart phone buyers as well.

I am an AT&T; customer and since this is the international version, you just need to take it for unlocking. Being the international version, you get the better processor and performance than the carrier branded version.The phone is blazingly fast and the multi-window feature is pretty nifty, although not very useful realistically, just in some rare occasions. The stylus is the most convenient feature ever in a smartphone since the color screen. It is super useful for note taking, screen captures and precise clicking on tricky pages. The other \"Samsung\" features (gesture support, air view, etc.) are all ok and useful. The screen is huge and colorful and a joy to use to watch movies and videos. Basically, this phone is a mini computer. Just to get this straight, this phone is so cool and multipurpose that I even considered buying a Bluetooth keyboard to replace my computer. No joke. You can even download torrents and use PDFs, Office files and scan and everything (with the proper apps, and I only download free apps).Structurally, the build quality looks pretty good but the phone is mostly plastic and very fragile. My HUGE critique of this phone is that without a cover, it is as slippery as a bar of soap. You HAVE to get a cover for this phone, to prevent slipperiness and to protect it from falls. I have a super cheap, brand-less, made-in-china $10 dollar plastic/rubber cover and it works like a charm. The trick is to find a cover that doesn't add to its overall thickness (I had an Otterbox for the phone and it turned it into a literal brick). The phone size without the cover is big (duh!) but it fits into jeans fine. I mostly store it in my back pocket and it only protrudes just a bit. You can also put it in front pocket and it will look and feel ok. If I am wearing thin dress pants or going out somewhere really fancy, I take the rubber cover off and take it naked (no cover) in a jacket pocket or a pants pocket and it feels fine.The only other problem I encountered was receiving text messages. The phone apparently stopped receiving text messages at least once a week (apparently a common issue for this unit), but it has not given me that problem in a quite a while (maybe an update fixed it?).Overall, this is the best phone I have ever owned. I have owned it for around 8 months now and it is still going strong. I also own a brand new Galaxy S4 by T-Mobile (for work) and my Note is still my favorite by miles.Get this phone!

Others have written quite extensively about its many plus features, and I echo those sentiments.  It does everything I ever imagined doing on a smartphone, and quite a lot more.  Best of all, I am free of the dark side (Apple).  I can now enjoy my choice of apps from a wide variety of sources, not just from the Play Store (the Android market) but virtually any other provider as well (requires a minor setting change on the setup screen).The huge screen makes viewing YouTube videos and Internet surfing comfortable and realistic.  The tiny smartphones out there make using the web so painful many of us (myself included) never used that feature.  This screen is amazing, and the videos look razor sharp.  The benefit?  You can live with this phone, and you need not drag your tablet or laptop with you to the coffee shop or restaurant.  No- it's not enough if you are going to try to work on Excel spreadsheets- but for general web and email... it's great!  Text messaging, your choice of type, swipe, or voice.And because it's Android Jelly Bean (now), you get all the joys of Google, including FREE Google Play to store all your (even iTunes) music up in the cloud on the Google servers.The BATTERY is replaceable on this phone (unlike Apple iPhone) and there is a micro SD-card slot inside the back case (i bought 64gb MicroSD card from Amazon for $50 and have 76MB of storage on this phone!).  Since I use Google Play streaming all 7000 of my songs from the cloud, all that storage is available for applications, photos and 1080p VIDEOS.  The 8 MegaPixel camera is more than fantastic, I never use my real camera OR Camcorder any more at all!Bought a nice UAG 'weaponized' case for this (also from Amazon), which doesn't add a lot of bulk (this phone is huge), but protects me from dropping it, and adds a bit of rubberized contact with my clothes- so it won't pop out of my pocket when I climb in and out of my car.  Prior to getting the UAG case, the phone frequently jumped out by itself onto the car seat.  Not good, and worse if it did so and landed on the street or a hard surfaced floor.  Thus when I saw another person with the UAG case, I immediately jumped on Amazon and purchased it, though the clear-plastic screen \"protector\" was garbage - I didn't use it, nor was I impressed by the glossy color cardboard panels included with the UAG case- I think the Titanium finish on this phone blows the socks off any type of 'case decoration', possible exception being Game of Thrones Sigil-cases.  One can never have too many talismans, and Winter is Coming!Nothing can be all things to all people, but this device is a solid win for Samsung- and a capable partner to their very popular tablet, the Note 10.1 (which I also own and very highly recommend).  Much is made of the so-called Retina displays on Apple products, both the Samsung Note 10.1 Tablet and the Galaxy Note 2 Phone have great looking displays that are pleasing to look at with good color separation and nice blacks.The writing stylus I use extensively on the TABLET during flight simulation.  I write down instructions from the realtime air traffic controller on the Note 10.1 (I could do this on this phone as well) during flight, so I don't have my flight deck littered with scratch paper.This phone is astounding, and great volume on the speakerphone.  Music playback?  Not a strength... I connect it to my car audio system (Bluetooth) or you can plug in a stereo earplug cord and plug it into your car audio input jack (as an alternative to Bluetooth).I don't think most people buy a phone for its music playback sound quality - the speakers don't produce enough bass to be practical, although the sound quality is acceptable, it's not as good as using your car stereo speakers!Overall- love it, and glad I left Apple.  BTW, I got mine from AT&T; as an upgrade, with 2 year commitment, at a substantially lower price point.  I was fortunate, having been an iPhone customer continuously for the past several years at AT&T;, I was able to continue with unlimited data.  I do strongly suggest enabling Wi-Fi whenever and wherever possible, and pay attention to your settings if you are on a 'metered' data plan, else your phone may gobble your data time unbeknownst to you.  I make sure to use Wi-Fi at home and at my office, Wi-Fi is always faster than 4G FYI.Battery life is excellent, though I make it a point to plug this in to A/C power in lieu of USB power when at home, because when plugged into the AC adapter, the unit recharges much faster than on USB.Great phone!", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phablet on the market.", "Author": "PC", "ReviewID": "R32MCSF5YTNXPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is perfect.

Font sizes go beyond Large to Huge, soI can read most things on my phone without also holding up a magnifer. The default display for most screens is a black background with light text (perfect!) I loaded photos of my contacts and the large display during an incoming call makes it easy for me to tell who is calling.  The voice control options are amazing and so freeing in letting me use more functions of the phone with ease.  I can dictate text messages, emails, internet searches.  I have to double check accuracy but it is pretty darn good and mistakes are easier to fix than trying to type all of it while holding a magnifier in front of my face using a virtual keyboard.  With Driving Mode On, the phone will announce incoming calls and will announce and read text messages.  This can be annoying to others if you leave it on in public but is very helpful to me in the right setting.The S Voice still has some quirks but until those are fixed, I will still enjoy the many parts that work great.  (Check my schedule, place a call, send a text message, open an app, turn a setting on or off etc.  The Calander is the part with the quirks)The S Pen is very convenient for taking notes while I am on a call.  I can set the font of the S pen to a thick one so I can see it.The camera is amazing and you can use voice control to snap a shot.  I am looking forward to finding a good portable magnifier app to help read menus etc.  It has a front facing camera as well for Skype.The phone is large but light weight, fits easily in a purse.  I bought a phone case that can serve as a wallet as well.  If you want to watch videos on the phone but need to hold it close to your face, the large screen combined with light weight of phone makes it comfortable.  I use a Kindle to read books but believe I could probably do the same on this phone.The phone has many, many custom settings available for accessibility which I have only begun to explore. You can set a swipe of your finger to open up a screen of your choice, so no hunting.  Then there are the many adnroid apps I am planning on trying out.  I have read bout some which call out the next bus stop, some apps tell you what stores are near you so if shopping in a mall and you cannot see the signs nearby you can find out what is close to you.I know the scope of my review has been very narrow and this phone has powerful features for those with normal eyesight that I have not even touched on.

Before buying this phone my main concern was to prefer the right the seller (considering there are many strange and unreliable seller in the market).I bought this product from Ranascorp (fullfilment by Amazon). The phone was shipped immediately and delivered in two days. I don't know why but when I opened the package I saw that the box was open. However, everything other than the open box was OK. The phone was brand new with protector films in place.  The accessories were brand new as well (though I bought a titanium gray phone the accessories are white).

If you didn't do it I recommend you to have a look at youtube and search for \"Coldfustion's Android 3D UI Tutorial [Galaxy Note 2] \". When you see the things you can change and the new look of your Note II I'm sure you will not believe it. Of course, everybody using an android phone might have the same look but it would not be the same as in your Note due to the screen difference. I applied many of the things Coldfustion described in that video. I further customized different things thanks to the inspiration by Coldfustion.

The 720p resolution on this 5.3 inch screen is a welcome joy even as 2013 rolls in with 1080p resolution devices (trust me, checked out the new HTC and that screen while lovely didn't give me buyers remorse) and still stands competent enough to give lovely visuals when doing anything from gaming to Netflix viewing. The camera is solid along nice extras such as Dropbox (48 free gigs after going through their activation process) to make storage an afterthought.Speaking of which, SD storage is a go. This is quite noteworthy since the Nexus 4 was a tempting thought as well as HTC's latest 1080p phone on Verizon but both a no go due to lack of SD expansion. Thus despite this being something that's been around since the G1 some manufactures on some models choose to start omitting it on high end phones. Thus my existing 32GB from old phone card felt right at home as it slid right into this powerhouse with the peace of mind that I can later on upgrade to 64GB.  Meanwhile the built in 16GB seems sufficient enough to handle some heavy app data + some of the HD vids I captured nicely enough.Touchwiz offers good & bad. The good is the S-Pen functionality which is a dream to use along with S-Note for scribbling quick notes (IMO writing notes on phone while talking is more hands free encouraging then size itself lol). A couple apps I use that enables S-Pen writing on PDF's is also great with S-Pen but outside of Samsung's own apps nothing I found uses the pressure sensing functionality of it to adjust the thickness by pressing down on it, perhaps that'll change but for now a small quirk on my otherwise beautifully flawless S-Pen experience.As for the rest of Touchwiz? Eh, the launcher compared to 3rd party launchers is kinda on the yuck side. And S-Voice is utter useless trash that needs to be kicked & curb stomped off this phone. While Google Now can be used by holding menu button, it's not as accessible as just double tapping the home button which defaults into S-Voice unless you're willing to do some work around fiddling on that.Other not so pleasant defaults about this phone is T-Mobile's ugly crap that hogs up Notification Bar (thankfully easily removed), and Google Wallet being a NO GO. That's right, despite the hardware being perfectly fine, NFC + Google Wallet isn't happening without rooting. This is a major reason why I'll eventually root (and might update to let you know how that goes) but for now a bummer that this is a carrier restricted cawk block that one has to hack around. T-Mobile's variant also have the multi-window functionality since X-Mas updates so while it doesn't work with all apps as of yet, being able to Youtube while reading Gmail or text or Tweet is certainly a nice thing to be enjoyed.Overall even with the cons, they pale in comparison to the overpowering beastly positives of this phone which has been a joy (especially with battery carrying me all through the day after heavy screen usage).

Last week, not even ten months after the original purchase, the phone stopped working.When I try to power up my phone, it displays the banner screen ('Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7100'), but then it stops there. It never leaves the banner screen, it never dims, it's just stuck there.I've tried removing/replacing the battery, SIM card, and flash RAM card, I've tried (unsuccessfully) to get into Recovery Mode, all of these with and without the phone plugged into the charger. Nothing I try works.I contacted Samsung USA, only to be told that Samsung USA will not support the phone because it originated in the UK. When I contacted Samsung UK, they informed me that they will not support their devices when used outside their country, and advised that I contact Samsung USA or my retailer. Of course, the retailer won't help me - they didn't manufacture the product.For $645, I purchased a nice phone that served me well. Through no fault of my own, it has inexplicably died, and Samsung will not even discuss the problem with me.As you can imagine, I am extremely disappointed in Samsung. While their products are arguably the best in the Android world, their interest in their customers - and repeat business - seems to be very limited. I have never witnessed such blatant neglect of responsibility for a product this new, costing this much.Why would I ever want to buy another Samsung product - much less recommend Samsung products to those I know - if this is how they treat their customers?I own a Samsung monitor and a Samsung TV.

I purchased it new from Verizon on a 2 year upgrade last year, and since then it has been my power-house of productivity. It was a huge shift from the iPhone 4 I owned prior to this, that was so limited in what it could do that I was having to find a work-around every time I turned around. Eventually, it just became frustrating- so I got this. The Galaxy Note 2 is meant to do one thing: exactly everything you want it to do.The S-pen is a nice, intuitive touch. When I first got the phone, I was surprised by the fact that it was exactly like the old, hard tipped stylus' use to be, and yet, somehow, it works flawlessly with my capacitive touch screen. The features that come with the pen are incredible as well- give it just a couple of days, and the phone seems to learn you handwriting, making it so that everything you write is nearly flawless. Nearly. However cool, it is somewhat inconvenient to write your text messages instead of simply typing it in.My most favorite features of the phone are, by far, the ones Google has integrated straight into Samsung's TouchWiz OS. By long pressing on the menu button, you will pull up your Google, which includes Google now, and intuitive searching. In an instant, make a phone call, find an app, the weather, or even your way home if you happen to have gotten lost.Also integrated into the Samsung keyboard is Google's voice-to-text. Over time, as you speak to your phone more, Google will learn to recognize your voice, improving accuracy and making life just that much easier. This feature can be enabled or disabled through the options in the Google Now app (the app that pops up when you long press of the menu button from the home screen).The Smart gestures of the phone are another interesting, and stunning feature that Samsung has included. Reading something and don't want your screen to go to sleep? No problem, your phone can sense when you are looking at it so that the screen wont time out! In a meeting when suddenly you get a call from Joe? Quickly shut off the sound by turning your phone over, or placing your hand over the screen. Your new Galaxy Note 2 will also come with a variety of lock options, including the ability to unlock at the sound of your voice, unlocking when it sees your face, or a mix of any of the locking options available.Now, just a disclaimer: This voice is still an electronic device, and no electronic device is going to be 100% flawless. Sometimes the phone will bug out, and you'll have to restart it. This does not mean the phone is bad, or broken, just simply struggling. It was made by humans, after all, and so long as humans have flaws, so will the things we make.Be careful of the apps your download. If your phone starts acting bugging, restarting on its own, acting unusual, being slow, simply go back and get rid of the last couple of apps you got, and it may fix the problem.All in all, this phone is excellent! 5 out of 5 stars for an incredibly intuitive device- Samsung seems to have thought of everything, and packed it in to this single power-house of a phone!", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone is GREAT", "Author": "Mikie", "ReviewID": "RKWQJHXVGW5MM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now first thing I didn't buy this here.

[Note 2 > (S3 + iPhone 5)]", "Author": "CCCL350", "ReviewID": "R29UTYT6GQE29P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Note 2 does everything better than the S3 and has additional tablet like features. We all know that the build quality is great and that it has impressive technical specs. The phone is basically a quad core 1.6ghz mini computer that is like a node for my brain. This thing makes me feel like a cyborg, because I depend on it a lot due to its' high productivity and instant network connectivity. It basically makes life a whole lot easier. I love 4G LTE, and I vouch for GSM. I can swap devices or put in prepaid simcards internationally if I wanted to.  There is also something more inspiring about the Note 2 than the S3 and iPhone 5. That is because of its very accurate S-pen stylus. Evernote + Microsoft OneNote make this phone an excellent device for school. I can hand write my notes using the S-pen's handwriting software and upload my digital notebooks onto the web. The S-pen has also enabled me to continue drawing and practice design w/ Autodesk's Sketchbook pro. Before being an architectural draftsman, I was a Fine-Arts major and this phone has helped me to continue working on my sketching skills. I prefer drawing on this phone than using my Wacom intuos 4 tablet. Its a very efficient and convenient phone for academic and artistic purposes.Negative speculations:  There are some negative things about owning an Android phone. One of the reasons that this phone suffers is because of the sub standards android + Samsung maintains. Samsung manufactures cheaper phones and Android has to work w/ other cheap-ass devices as well, so the reliability and app market suffers. Apple is able to have the best app developers favor their devices because they have only one phone model's specs to program. This continues to make apple phones the best for apps and peripheral devices. I think that won't be an issue some time in the future, however. Also the music player on this phone sucks. It came w/ about 4 or 5 media players and I don't know which one is the default one. Almost all of those media players require a monthly payment. To me the best user friendly phone media player would be Windows phone 7's Zune player. It can easily play and search music + podcasts even while driving. Try changing a song on Android, and you could crash.Positives:  The positive thing about using this phone, is that its an instant HDD every time its connected to a PC via usb/blue tooth. Dragging files to and from the phone is easy unlike the hyper intrusive Zune and iTunes programs. There is no converting audio files or transferring seed folders to proprietary software.WP7 users know how inconvenient it is to add Zune + Xbox live accounts just to add some music and play mini games on their phones. Itunes is just as bad, there is none of that intrusive crap w/ the Note 2. I mentioned that the Media player was crappy, but it is able to play uncompressed .Flac, .aiff, and .wav files. The Note 2 is a high quality music player, it just needs a nicer looking music player interface.I've tried the same apps on other android devices, but on the Note 2 they run better and faster.Like I said, this phone is a better version of the SIII in everyway. It has a faster processor, better battery life, larger screen, and large storage potential.

SGN II has great characteristics. It has a remarkable display, camera, S-pen, and multi-tasking screen. This device has the largest screen out of all smartphones which is 5.5 inches, with super HD AMOLED display. The screen produces pictures in such clarity because AMOLED displays have faster pixel switching response times than do traditional OLED displays. Also, its 8MP camera is great in capturing and recording because it features with many options. For instance, SGN II has face detection modes, panorama modes, burst shots, scence mode, filters, and many more.Likewise with SGN II recorder, that contains the same features with three options for recording mode that are: normal, fast motion, and slow motion. Besides that, SGN II came armed with an S-Pen which makes SGN II very creative compared to an IPhone 5. This pen allows SGN II users to draw and write on its screen and it gets typed, no matter how bad your hand writing is, SGN II recognizes the word and types at the same time. In addition, SGN II is the only smartphone that features with a multi-tasking mode, which allows you to use two applications at once by splitting the screen into two halves for each application. For example, you can watch a movie on Netflix and check your e-mail at the same time.A lot of people avoid SGN II due to its gigantic size. However, SGN II's size is not a huge problem since it has a lot of great features. I have been using it for over a months and I have never had an issue with its size, because the phone is very light, and comfortable.

It didn't look practical to carry around let alone use it for just for web surfing or phone calls.  I even had the S3 for about a month before getting the Note 2 and I really liked the S3. Anyways, I decided I'd give it a try because I was in need of a new phone.All my concerns about size and practicality were proven wrong after just using it for a day.  I really really love this phone.  It is the BEST phone I ever had and I do not regret getting this one bit.  The screen size is perfect for web surfing which I do frequently.  I have an iPad 2 as well and I used to use it a lot more but I find myself more and more using the Note because the its just right in my pocket and the screen size is large e nough for me to not get annoyed of zooming in and out on other phones.The screen quality itself seems to be slightly more dull than the S3 but its hard to notice if you blast the screen to full brightness. The battery life is awesome too.  I used to have to download apps to do some battery saving but I can surf the web, play some games and watch an episode or 2 on netflix without having to charge my battery for most of the day.There is probably just one down side which is the pen that is included.  I find that the pen is just way too sensitive.  At times I will be 1/2 an inch away but it will still think I'm touching the screen.  It's a little annoying and probably my biggest pet peeve - so much so that I hardly ever want to use it.  It's hard to find reasons too though for me.Other than that, this is an amazing phone.

Prior to this phone my wife and I had Samsung Galaxy Proclaim, HTC EVO 4G, LG Optimus S, two different iPhones and some low end phones.I can't comfortably talk on the speakerphone when driving on the highway because of the road and wind noise.

That does not interest me since I mainly favor productivity and multi-tasking.  You can ditch your wallet and buy a case with a wallet. You can buy a water, dust proof one (I have Jump from T-mobile so I do not care if I drop it, I will probably trade it in after a year or two).

R. Ward", "ReviewID": "R331ZFIMLEV61V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Disclosure I did not buy from this seller, had to buy from Docomo (I'm stationed in Japan) but I went here to Amazon for my reviews and was appreciative of them.  Phones we have had over the years: Original Moto Driod, HTC incredible, Driod Bionic, Blackberry,  Driod X, iPhone 4s (iPad 2, Nexus 7, Xoom, ASUS Transformer all in the house).  I tried owning the iPhone 4s, because most people that have iPhones would give their life up for Apple so I had to try it out.  Had it for 4 months, and it wasn't for me.  I think the iPad is better than all if not most Andriod tablets but not the phone.  I have had andriod since before 2.1 and have seen the changes.  iOS is VERY fluid and operates well.  That being said Jelly Bean (4.1+) is just as fluid.  I am a large multi-tasker and crashed my iPhone 4s many times, meaning I have pushed the iPhone to the limit.  I asked some of my iHeads what tricks they had, there were none they were just happy I was using my phone well.  Some apps did look prettier on the iPhone because of the developer.  Things that made me break my contract and switch to this phone was the screen size, widgets, customizable OS (having multiple programs be able to open/share my pdfs or pictures, more efficient keyboard etc), free apps, NOTIFICATIONS, and Google's products: gmail, calendar (the widget and month view are why I finally switched I missed a meeting with Apple's calendar) maps, voice etc, that I love and are better experienced on the android.  But if you are wondering iPone vs Andriod look to other reviews. I think it is helpful to state where you come from to give a perspective, slightly more bias toward android but obviously not completely.  iPhone 5 is lighter than the 4s and slightly bigger but very narrow!  The 4s seemed like this glass square that was going to shatter on the next drop.My debate was going between the Galaxy S3 or the Note II.  95% of what I do on my phone is the internet, if you include texts then probably 99%.  I am in Japan and my calls are per min and if I'm going to call the US I'm using Ooma.  I wanted more screen size to read easier. Looking at the Note 2 it is big especially compared to the S3.  I'm 6'8\" (which all `big people' reviews loved this phone) and I can barely wrap my fingers completely around so they touch. If you can palm a basketball you must own this phone it's a no brainer.  Use your size for good.  Normal sized people can enjoy this masterpiece as well! It is slightly faster than the S3 (which I think is the perfect screen size for the masses. I would hit the wrong letter often on the small iPhone 4s and the 5's width isn't bigger). In your hand it doesn't feel as big as it looks.  Tactile illusion? Although everyone always asks is that an ipad mini? There are options to make things like the keyboard smaller for 1 handed operations.  I switch between 1 and 2 and don't mind the large keyboard but again, you can customize this phone to you.  It fits in my pockets easily, that wasn't a concern as I have a nexus 7 that can fit easily.  The iphone would spin in my pocket horizontal anyway and take up the same space, if not more because this phone would be difficult to spin in a pocket.  I'm someone though when I sit down I hate things in my pockets and take everything out.  Also you know where it is and don't accidently put other things in that pocket!The software seems just as fast if not smoother than my iPhone.  I've seen video comparisons but now it's getting really too close to call.  I didn't know if the S-pen would be something I would use and I still don't know if I would miss it.  I think my kids like it more than anything.  That all being said the MULTI-window-multi task is phenomenal! The pop up window browser is a great idea to quick get info. I encourage you to look at the videos showing this. All the android options save 2 or three touches per app it seems but that all adds up. If you have a BB or an android the LED is awesome. No more turning on the phone to see if anyone contacted you.  I also have a different sound for every notification email txt msg etc so you can let it lapse.  Google now is a great feature that you must see that is on all 4.1 Jell Bean phones and tablets.  Chrome is great how bookmarks and search history are synced so that you can open your tabs that are open on your desktop or phone or tab.  This is on the iPhone but it's over the top of safari's engine.I am very impressed with the Camera. It has a lot of options and takes pictures very quickly. I used to be jealous of the iPhone for that specific function now it seems to be similar. I think it is faster and quality is about the same.  If you care about quality bring your SLR. The S3 looks and seems to be the same phone and I went with this guy because it was slightly bigger and the S-Pen seemed like a cool feature that I could get used to.  In a meeting using the pen to jot down a note makes it look more professional than typing on the phone, because it looks like you are texting etc.  Well with the note 2 the top screen could be a chat and the bottom screen notes!Things I don't like: the main button, I'd prefer having the Google black bar at the bottom, although the absence of this helps with more screen size in landscape which is why I think they did it. But Jelly Bean and ICS have the multitask button right there where the note you have to press and hold the main button.

Large screen, bright display and is very fast. Great call quality, especially the speaker phone. I cannot stop using this phone. Unfortunately, the phone only gets three stars to two reasons:1. Warranty and support is not available in North America where this phone is used. If Samsung is selling unlocked world phone, they should honour the warranty anywhere, as long as the customer can produce proof of purchase. And why is Samsung bowing to the Telcos and not releasing unlocked phones in North America? Hopefully, I will not have to deal with warranty issues, but I don't see this going well if I do.2. All the bloatware Samsung include with the phone. There are tons and tons of apps I will never use. Why not give customers the option to remove apps that is of no interest to them. These take up precious memory that you cannot reclaim. Painstakingly disable each app is not sufficient. There should be a uninstall option with no reinstall with future OS upgrades. The only plus is this unlocked phone has slightly less bloatware than a phone purchased from a Telco.Upon receiving the phone, I thought it would definitely be a five star product. After turning it on, I was immediately disappointed with all the crap on the screen and no option to remove them.

Still, because of the S Pen and being able to point on items instead of hoping my fingers land just right, and because of the screen size for watching videos, I would get the Note 2 again over the iPhone.

I spent some time trying to fix it but didn't get to it within the 30 day period until my previous phone was stolen at the gym. I had to get the phone working at this point. I went to a phone technician and he told me that the phone was stolen because the IMEI was blacklisted. I replied this was impossible since I bought it shrink wrapped through Amazon. I went to a 2nd & 3rd phone technician who told me the same thing. At this point, I was livid and thought I had been scammed so I initiated a return request even though it was outside the 30 day window. Amazon and the seller immediately jumped on the issue.While the seller initially protested that it was impossible the phone was stolen, I was skeptical at this point. The seller was very attentive to my concerns. The 3rd technician got it all sorted out. While I don't know understand exactly what was wrong, I think that it may have just been that one in a million phone that had a problem with the IMEI or firmware. I told myself that I would never buy anything online again when I initially contacted Amazon but the way that Amazon and PVCS handled the issue secured my business if I do need to buy something online again. While I cannot give the transaction 5 stars because I had issues with it and had to spend an extra $120 to get it sorted on my own, I am content with the end result.

Since they wouldn't let me post my opinion over there, I decided to share it here. The transition switching from an iPhone (IOS) to the SGN2 (Android) was a little bumpy, but well worth the change. Despite all the great things already said, this phone does have one big caveat. You see, it slipped off a coffee table about 18\" from the floor onto a tiled floor after having it for about 2 weeks and ended up cracking a small part of the front glass even though I had a Nillkin case on it. The phone was still in perfect working condition and the damage is purely cosmetic.Since I'm located in the US, I called Samsung USA about repairing the screen and had to give them my IMEI #, but they couldn't locate it on their database because this was an unlocked phone so they directed me to their International Division. After calling the 800 number, I was informed that I had to call one of the two of their nearest authorized repair centers that were located in Canada. Whaaat?! At this point I gave up. It was too much of a hassle calling one person to the next so I decided to leave the phone in its current cracked state. I assume I could have gotten it repaired, but chose not to deal with the currency exchange and paying to ship the phone out of the US at my expense.So long story short, if you ever need service or repair to this phone, Samsung USA will not support it. There are cell phone repair vendors in the mall and the like, but I would have preferred a local Samsung service center since it was still covered under warranty. I would have had to pay for the labor costs, but at least it would have been done to their specs.The only way you would get SGN2 service/repair support is if the phone was sold and subsidized in the US which is ridiculous because this International GN2 has the same hardware as the US one does.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best large-size smartphone on the market.", "Author": "Ramiro Ferrer \"Ramiro\"", "ReviewID": "R27YM4ZNNBQKE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you can get used to a smartphone this size, there is no better choice.

The S3 was free after rebate - the Note 2 cost me $100. Screen size is amazing - 5.5\" screen vs. 4.8\" for the S3, or 4\" for the iPhone 5. It is definitely a 2-handed phone, which I am still not used to. It is very difficult to unlock my screen with one hand. Just holding it in my hand using it as a phone is quite uncomfortable.  The firm wide grip actually causes an ache in your hand.  I think this pretty much pushes the limit of how big a phone can be and still usable as a phone. It goes in my front pocket just fine.  It's a bit wide but I think I can get used to it.  Performance seems to be about the same. Download speed maxes out around 28 Mbps on T-Mobile 4G (HSPA+). The camera is real cool. You can hold down the \"shutter\" button and it will burst as many frames as you want. It has 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB internal flash memory storage - lots of space for pictures and video. I don't know if I'm going to get a lot of use out of the stylus, but it does have some cool apps. Battery life is amazing.

It is very fast, no stuttering with screen changes, the 4G lite network is very fast with minimal load times on internet.  Quad core is clearly fast.  No comparison. Jelly Bean is awesome.  The calendar is so much better than the one I had on Droid X.  I just love this phone.  It has face detection so screen is always faced at correct rotation.  The camera without flash is not great.  I took a bunch of pictures of my cat and only one was decent but it was dark.  it has google popup that alerts me to weather, traffic, game scores.  I used Mybackup pro to transfer pictures, Apps and contacts from old phone to SGN2.  I like the white cover and will have Otterbox defender in my possession soon.  Buy this phone if you are able.  The phone is not all that big meaning I got use to the size in just two days.  At first I thought holy crap this is big.  Now I think it is just about right size for phablet.  The only minor gripe is i cannot figure out how to keep screen on when plugged into charger.  I have it on with docking but the screen times out.

Product arrived in good condition but the box was open (samsung factory seals broken).  I assume this is because the seller had to unlock the phone before it was sent to me as they do not sell factory unlocked samsung devices.Phone condition was good no scratches it appeared to be new.  The phone worked fine with my AT&T; sim card.  3G speeds are not available only edge and H speeds.  This is an international phone and that is not mentioned by the salesman.  When I first turned on the phone it was in German.  I also ordered the 64gb san disk card and so far no issues with that I put it in the phone and pow I had 59 gb available plus the 9 gb that is available on the phone when you recieve it (16gb but really only 9 gb due to OS).  Fetures are awesome and the phone is great everything I expected.  The back cover is difficult to take off and put back on and very cheaply made but I dont plan on pulling it off again.  I got the Ionic case with it and it is an ok case.This would have been a 5 star review but the very cheap crappy samsung USB adaptor plug in (USB cable to a wall plug type adaptor) did not even last a day.  For $700 bucks you would think samsung could supply you with a normal wall plug type charger not a crappy adaptor for a USB cable.  Now I am having to charge my phone with the USB port on my note book and it takes forever due to the battery size in the phone.  Also I am not sure what everyone is talking about as the battery fully charged only lasted a day with heavy usage.  S Pen is really cool as well as voice command.  This morning when the alarm went off to get up I just said stop and it turned off the alarm.  My S Pen is a little sensitive but I am sure I will get used to it.  Bottom line dont get hung out to dry if you order this phone go to best buy or whatever and buy a real wall charger for the phone.Update:I can't use the samsung app because the phone says it has a samsung app account in saudi arabia.  Originally I thought the phone was from germany but now I understand because there is a direct flight from jeddah to frankfurt.  The germans are buying these a cut rate prices from some foreign source in saudi arabia and then mark up and sell.  Phone could be from a batch of defective phones.  Corruption is so bad in saudi arabia who knows.

I was hesitating to upgrade, but at the end I just couldn't resist, so I ordered it. It's a fabulous phone and it's speed is just outstanding. But I am bit disappointed with the screen. The old model has resolution 1280x800, this one is only 1280x720, which I knew ahead of time, but I didn't really bother about the 80 pixels. Well, but I should have. Because of this reason, it doesn't support 5 icons in line anymore, neither 5 icons wide widgets, which is a shame. I had to install 3rd party launcher, so I can have it done. Why would you make a new flag ship phone, if you have to make compromises? The flag ship is suppose to be the best in every single way, just the perfect one, which this one isn't.One more thing which I don't like is the construction. I am not a iPhone fan, but the way they made the iPhone 5 is just outstanding. The body is very well made with strong construction, it feels expensive when you hold it. The Galaxy Note 2 feels very fragile, I can't even put on a table, because I am afraid I'll scratch the back. And my biggest fear is that I'll break the back in half when taking it of to change mu SIM card or memory card.

Anyways, the phone is great and definitely draws some attention. The first thing you'll notice about this phone is how big the screen is. It really truly is a big screen and I was little scared at first. However, you get used to it and I have learned to love it. My wife's iPhone is hard to type on now.

In summary, it is a terrible phone. Secondly, I find that the operating system does buggy things -- like if I change a setting, it may change back and when I go in and try to update the setting, it shows that the setting is different than it actually is. Rebooting helps, but that's so old-school Windows to have to do that all the time. My suggestion is that if you're only going to use it for its non-phone features, you'll be OK.

I used it to make calls, read and reply to emails, browse the web, watch YouTube, and check stock charts. I am not a very heavy gamer, so I did not play many games with it except stuff like Temple Run, Family Feud etc. I did not use SPEN but I can see it being useful for some.I was an iPhone 4s user before Note 2 and went back to an iPhone 5 after I returned the Note 2 to the A&T; store.Here are the things I like about this phone-* The excellent and vibrant screen- It's full of life and the colors just come so naturally to it, it's beautiful.Be careful however, you will not be able to see the screen in very bright sunlight. Also, the screen brightness varies between dim and bright even when you are reading a web page or an application. Not a deal breaker, but annoyance nevertheless..* Responsive and fast UI, Operating system. Google has delivered a pretty stable OS (I had 4.2.2 with this device)* Despite the 5.5 inch screen, the battery life is impressive.. It will last me a full day of moderate use and then some. Do know that battery takes about 2.5 hours to charge from about 10% to 100%.Here are the things I dislike-- The navigation seems to be suffering from a worst case of ADD. It just does not \"feel right\". There are just too many things, it seems like they have just thrown together to see what sticks. Too many backs, too many unnecessary swipes left and right, hidden menus. If you prefer simplicity and openness, iPhone  is the best platform.- The build quality is sub-par. It's made of a very cheap, shiny plastic that gets very greasy when you touch it.  The screen gets extremely greasy and looks awful after short usage, its unlike iPhone 5's screen that gives you a matte finish looks which looks gorgeous. The battery cover creaks and moans.- Samsung bloatware is too much to bear.

Great phone, TERRIBLE Service. DO NOT BUY From.....", "Author": "da_bunny", "ReviewID": "RK9G067PEXPFZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First time around I bought this phone on random selection for the Seller. According to the title of this phone it's Factory Unlocked, it is not specified as an international model in the title or the description. Only way to know that it is international is by researching the model number or looking more closely at what each individual seller description is.The first phone I got was from FGS Trading, I didn't know it was international until after I received the phone and when it turned on, it was in Mandarin. I had to google and youtube a video in order to walk me through setting the phone into English, imagine the hassle. I contacted this Seller about the issue, also that the phone was not syncing with my computer because the ID Hardware was not identifiable. The Seller refused to take back the phone without charging me extra and finally after almost 2 months of debating the issue with the seller, through Amazon's A-to-Z Claim I ended up getting a full refund. Tom is the name of the customer service agent from FGS who I spoke to and demonstrated over the exchange of 30 + emails that he clearly is not fit for customer service. For him, his company is always right and I was the airhead who didn't do my research into this phone.THE SELLER does not follow their 100% money back guarantee unless they are forced to and their customer service is lacking, if they were competent it would not have taken nearly 2 months to resolve the issue. This seller also does not offer return labels for the assurance that an item can be shipped back to them, they only provide an address. You have to pay for your own shipping, insurance and signature on the package just to make sure the Seller gets back their phone. **Buyer beware, if you purchase an international model SAMSUNG USA will not cover this phone under their warranties. In order for me to get any service on this phone I would have had to send it all the way back to Hong Kong. The Seller does not provide you with this information. All they cared about and clearly demonstrated was that they got their money so they no longer need you or positive feedback. In one of the email exchanges from the Sellers' agent, he told me that MOST CONSUMERS KNOW this phone is international and that they are happy with the phone they received and since I am unhappy/unsatisfied/clueless its my own fault because I did not do my research. Does that mean that those who posted similar reviews are clueless as well??? :(Now here's the kicker, I re-purchased this phone because I have wanted it for a really long time, BUT since I did not want to run into the same problem, I did my purchase with Amazon customer service on the phone.  Now, the Amazon agent was not aware that this phone was international either. World Wide Distribuitors did not have it labeled or specified as an international phone. I re-bought the phone only because it was assumed to be US Coded. The Amazon agent advised me that it was, otherwise the Seller must disclose that it is international.BOY!! were we wrong... I did not find out this phone was international until it was already in transit to me. The seller finally responded to my inquires 3 days after I made my purchase to inform me it was international. I immediately contacted the Seller by phone and the customer service person- Juan, who I spoke to was very nice. He told me to simply refuse the package. Aslong as the item remained unopened/unused and still in its original factory shipped form I would get a full refund.I followed his instructions and anticipated a full refund minus the shipping fee I paid. That did not happen. Upon my second phone contact with the seller, the first agent was not helpful, he informed me that I was subject to a restocking and a return shipping fee. At this point I requested to speak to a supervisor to justify why I was receiving two sets of information and how it was even LEGAL for the Seller to charge those fees.The supervisors name was Melissa, she was definatley NOT helpful. In fact, this person was unprofessional, rude and very condescending. Melissa informed me 1) my product was subject to a restocking fee and since the item was returned I would have to pay for that cost as well, 2) I could not contest it because it was a company policy clearly listed on Amazon's website and 3) Even if I filed an A-to-Z claim it would be denied immediately because the policies they have are all Amazon pre-approved. This person was snarky, rude and beyond tolerable. Melissa even refused to give me any company information in order to file a BBB claim. When I told them I would take the matter back to Amazon, she told me she would be happy to transfer me to Amazon customer service so that I can hear Amazon tell me that my refund request would be denied since I obviously needed to hear it from two sources.Two weeks have gone by since my purchase from World Wide and Amazon granted me a full refund since I refused this package. Amazon also gave me a promotional gift in the amount of the original shipping fee for the trouble I have encountered with the Seller. I have also submitted a BBB claim against this Seller and my complaint can be viewed publicly. So I suppose, in the end, Melissa, if you see this post, you were wrong.It's a shame really. I have wanted this phone for a long time and finally saved up enough to get it. Times are hard, cash is not expendable for most consumers and this purchase was a luxury item purchase for me. I never expected to get so much trouble. When I did have the phone, it was a wonderful experience since I had never had something before that could do so much. It played movies, music, took wonderful pictures, writing instead of using the qwerty board to text was awesome. I really love this phone but I will not sign a contract to have it :(....

As someone who has owned everything from the Nokia 3360 (indestructible) to the Iphone 4, this is the most expensive and least durable phone I have ever seen, by far. The stylus and note-taking features were the initial draw for me, but the program for taking notes is setup very poorly, and you can't take notes on a phone that doesn't work.

Hmm, wonder when they snuck that in.  Works great now.  A big five star!!!Update: 12/27  My wifi keep going away and I have to log into it.  Not sure what is going on.  Oh, I brought a case for it and tore out the plastic case and put velcro on the inside of it and the hooks velcro on the back of my cellphone.  The plastic case will protect it, in case of falls and the velcro hooks make it easier to hold onto.  The when I go somewhere, I just velcro it together, inside the case and carry it that way.  An expensive cellphone like the Note II, deserves protection or ouch, buy another one.Update: 12-20  Because Samsung screwed me out of multitasking!  No sidebar for United States, a vital features, that other Countries are using.  It was built for multitasking and Samsung is denying it to Americans.  Until they upgrade my Note II so it can multitask, I will only give it a * one star.  I suggest other people do this, too.  Maybe if their bottom line $$$$ shrinks, they will give it to the world and not just a few!  Shame on Samsung.  Is this blackmail?  No,it's the only tool I have, to get them to play fair with ALL buyers of Note II.Update 12/14;  This is stupid.  In 'Nearby devices\" 'allow device list', you can select the device, BUT YOU CAN'T SAVE THE LIST!!?  You can either 'CANCEL' or \"DELETE', items in the list.  You can select, but no way of saving them.  Da!  Why have a 'Device' list if you can't save it?  Samsung??The best thing I love about it, it talks to my Samsung LED tv!

Also, Facebook is missing if you want to take a picture and send it to your Facebook account.Samsung?!!!  I email mine and then transfer it over to my Facebook account.I've had mine for a couple of days.  GOt it from aTT@$299+2yr contract<$100 per monthThe camera is better than many DSLR's or point and shoot camera.  Close ups, distance, low light, this does them all.  And with Android play store, you have countless photo apps to adjust your picture + share.  I use Allshare to view the pic's on my Samsung tv, works fine. Easy to send to Facebook or email.THis is a well thought out cellphone.  The only thing I don't like about it, is the location of the on/off button.  I keep hitting it with my finger.If you are going to get it, just as well go the ATT route and save a few hundred bucks. $299!  Ask them to give you free activation and they will do it.Great customer service, they will help with anything.  Ask about their 300 minute plan, if you force them to tell you and free data!Oh, the cellphone.  It has a cellphone, too!  More on that later....Merry X-mas!Don't try to cancel, if with ATT.  They keep leading you around in circles, from one person to the next, to wear you down and give up.

The delivery and packaging were he only good things about this phone.

I didn't know the phone could only be used internationally, at least that's what I was told when I took it up to Verizon hoping they could activate the phone for me. But there was no ESN number in the phone and SIM card would not register the phone. Do not buy unless you fully research this phone which was a mistake on my part.

After purchasing Apple TV, iphone 3gs, and ipad 3 on the launch day, this screen size of 5.5\" became too irresistible. This phone had the biggest size screen I can carry everywhere.My happiness lasted only one week. I accidentally dropped it from nearly 2 feet height, and glass screen got cracked from top level corner side. All good reviews about strength of CORNING\u00ae GORILLA\u00ae GLASS, and good drop tests became meaningless to me, as it couldn't survive my first drop, while iphone 3gs survived multiple such drops or worse (from up to 4 feet) without any issue. I may be unlucky that the impact point was corner, but others need to be beware of this fact that 2 feet drop is sufficient to crack the glass if the ground hits the corner of phone.  Biggest reason of my low ranking is its repair cost. Samsung support service were sympathetic, but did not budge on waiver or reduction of cost (~$191), even if only glass has cracked, while touch screen, display etc were working fine. Glass can be purchased separately for only around $30, but changing glass will make my warranty void. Samsung replaces glass with full lcd Screen + Touch Digitizer Assembly and that increases the cost, and you can forget about some positive surprises like iphone support, where sometimes they replace phone with screen cracks free of cost.Other negatives/issues I found, which you should consider before buying- Camera quality is not so good , especially the foucs/image stabilization. My 8 mp, 5 year old normal point and shoot canon camera(sd 870) can shoot much better and crisp photo than this both in low indoor light or full outside daylight. So for any trip, I will need to carry both camera, and phone. This phone can't replace that point and shoot camera.- I definitely miss the easy to use apple's airplay feature.  May be I will need to purchase google tv, but thats additional cost, and not sure how good that will work.- There is no way to disable 4g LTE /3gs feature. Iphone 3gs had that nice feature to disable 3g, which is very useful, in a road trip, where I just need to search for some store hours/address or location, and I don't want fast 3gs/4g lte to accidentally do some background tasks and go over my data limit of 200 MB within 4-5 minutes.- Touch screen seems not as responsive as iphone. Sometimes I need to press  refresh/done etc button of browser 4-5 times before that touch is registered.Positives of phone are already covered in many other reviews, so I won't repeat them to keep this review focused on the drawbacks of phone/support service, so that readers can take an informed decision about purchasing this phone.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its been only 2 months", "Author": "Kiyoshi Mukai \"Overchan2\"", "ReviewID": "RNFJE96JRF6QH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was happy with this phone, but it has 4 dead pixels.

I work with film (digital), and 3D modeling applications. The OS is amazing, the phone/phablet is NEARLY flawless, and I love it's cutting edge performance. I want this beauty so badly but a 16GB internal memory isn't going to cut it for me. This phone/phablet is meant to replace a laptop, camera, sketchbook and WAS going to be my mobile workstation. With all that capability you'd think they'd release this phone with a 32GB and 64GB option at the same time on all the carriers. I've scoured the internet and no one at the stores can give me a straight answer about the memory options and if/when they'll be available. It's so frustrating to finally find the phone/phablet that's practically perfect in nearly every way - except skimpy on memory for it's abilities. If I'm going to have it for two years the minimum I'd buy is a 32GB model. C'mon where are the bigger memory options for this thing? They are keeping people like me from committing! While I realize you can buy a memory card (I'll be getting one too) my issue is that if I'm going to use it for two years on contract I don't want to have to pick and choose what to load on the phone or worry about storing more on the card than phablet/phone itself especially since I intend to wear out all those useful features. I want to show people what I'm working on now and on projects I've done in the past - or show them my 3D models. That all takes up memory and instead of waiting on an iffy connection it makes sense to have what you need with you period. I say go big or go home and I want a to use this beauty to it's full potential and test the limits to see just how much it can really handle.That being said I have to ask why they won't release the other memory option models with such an amazing OS and phablet/phone. I think it's time we all pester Samsung about this. If they can release this overseas with all the memory options why won't they do that here in the US with such a massive market? The iPhone 5 has all three available, the S III launched the same as have many others so why the rub on this beast of a phablet/phone? Another thing to think about is what if they are holding out for the annoying Black Friday or Cyber Monday? I don't want to commit only to find out I could've gotten the model I REALLY wanted if I had waited two more weeks or a month. That's happened to me before so I'd like to not have to deal with it again. Has anyone else experienced that frustration? \"If only I'd waited another two weeks!\"That being said my ONLY complaint (I'm talking to you Samsung)is that for such a gorgeous beast of a tool you don't seem too concerned about not offering the 32GB and 64GB options for this market.
