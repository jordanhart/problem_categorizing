HTC One V, HTC EVO V, Galaxy SII, Galaxy Reverb, and now i have this one the Galaxy Victory. what can i say but what an Awesome phone. out of all these phones ive had this is the Winner!...ill start with my most important thing when it comes to a smart phone The Battery and this one has it 2100 mAh. its Awesome! plenty of juice and then some. Speed and Performance are great thanks to the DC and 1GB ram. the new Jelly Bean OS is a Nice Upgrade from ICS its buttery smooth has some great new features. this is basically a mini Galaxy SIII, just abit smaller size. Games play Amazing on this phone had no Issues, ive tested gta3 to angry birds, it was all nice n smooth. cameras on front and back are great about the same as the Galaxy Reverb, maybe slightly better, also has a dedicated camera button to witch is always nice...Overall this is the best VM offering to date imo. if your looking for a upgrade this would be a excellent option...One thing that i found as a negative was the storage space for apps was lacking and no app2sd support.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent upgrade on VM/Sprint's 4G LTE Network", "Author": "K. Burke", "ReviewID": "R2XVDFG2LHCABG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently got tired of listening to my wife complain about how slow the VM/Sprint network was, and about how she couldn't get service inside of her work (a metal building). We both have Evo V 4Gs and I've been mostly pleased with mine, and she liked hers except for the service, but for her the service was a killer. She was about to go out and get an on-contract phone from one of the big carriers, and she was prepared to spend alot of money on it. We have been on VM for a couple of years now and I've been fairly pleased (impossible to beat the value, IMHO) and I really didn't want her getting tied up in a contract with a phone that would end up being obsolete halfway through the contract. And then I saw the new Galaxy Victory using Sprint's 4G LTE network. I did a little research and found that they have 4G service in our area and are currently upgrading their network, so I went ahead and got her this one as a gift...She loves it. It solves all of the problems she was having with the 3G service. We have Wimax in our area too but there is simply no comparison between the 4G LTE and the 4G Wimax (with the Evos), much less 3G. The 4G LTE works in her work building, the Wimax doesn't, and the 3G is slow there. Using the Speedtest app I have been able to consistently clock in anywhere from 12-17 mbps download speed with the Galaxy Victory, and I haven't found a spot yet in our city that doesn't get 4G. In comparison, the Evo V 4G maxed out at 7.7 mbps, with typical speeds in the 2-3 mbps range. Page loading isn't instant on either device, but it is VERY fast on the Victory, usually anywhere from 2-5 seconds. The Wimax is much better than 3G obviously, but coverage is very spotty and unreliable, and it gets blown out by the 4G LTE. Typical 3G speeds in my area were usually about 300-500 kbps, so the 4G LTE is typically anywhere from 25 to 60 times as fast as 3G. There is no comparison, and it is immediately noticeable. The 4G LTE just takes it to a whole new level.The phone itself is snappy enough with 1GB of RAM and a 1.2GHz dual-core processor. Not top of the line but certainly fast enough for anything short of very high-end gaming. The onboard storage is a bit thin at 4GB with only about 1.7GB of user storage, but it does have a microSD slot and with a 32GB card in there (cheap nowadays) there is plenty of room. Note that Apps2SD doesn't work on it, so you really are limited to that 1.7GB for your apps. But it should be plenty of space for the large majority of users. Just get a storage card for your music, movies, pics etc and leave the phone storage for apps and you will be GTG.The GPS seems perfectly adequate. It was able to acquire a fix within about 5-7 seconds consistently, and with 4G the maps load very fast. It gets a fix indoors fairly quickly as well. GPS Status app showed me getting 17 satellites indoors in an upstairs room when I checked it.The camera is nothing to write home about, but it's not terrible either. Seems to be a bit picky about what sort of light it takes pics in. With adequate light the pictures come out clear and fairly crisp, in a dim room the flash, while illuminating enough to get a picture, seems to blur things a bit. The camera is perfectly functional and pics are usually decent, but if you're buying a phone for a great camera look elsewhere. (ETA - a little more playing around with the camera and I am more impressed; while still not a great camera it is definitely serviceable. It does have about a 2-3 second shutter delay though, my only real gripe). If you want a great camera then you probably ought to be reading reviews for cameras...Call quality sounded really bad the first phone call I made, but after that it sounds just fine. I had read about that same phenomenon in a review somewhere, but it seems a problem with activation or adjustment, and it resolved itself almost immediately. I can hear others fine and they can hear me fine. Also, the speakers sound perfectly fine (for phone speakers) and I have not experienced any problems with audio quality as reported in another review.The phone comes loaded with Jellybean, Android 4.1.2 OS. If you've used ICS then you will be right at home with Jellybean, and it seems to run a bit smoother. With Jellybean and 4G LTE this phone is pretty much future proof (as much as any phone can be, I guess), so no need to worry about it quickly becoming obsolete, it will be GTG for at least a year or so, probably longer. Having Google Now and S Voice (slightly redundant) are nice, too, and the S Beam / NFC is neat if you know someone with a compatible phone.My wife and I both prefer smaller phones. I am not at all interested in carrying around one of those little tablets that they call phones nowadays like the Victory's larger cousins, and I prefer something iPhone-sized without the Apple in it. The Victory is perfectly sized. The 4.0\" screen is just large enough I think for whatever you want to do, but not too big to use with one hand. The screen is not the most crisp out there but it's not bad either. A previous reviewer said he went back to the HTC One V (which I used for quite awhile) and I don't get it, this screen is no less crisp than the One V's and the phone's performance is light years better in every way. Some reviews call this phone too thick but I don't see it. It is only too thick if you're expecting Galaxy S4 thinness - which I don't feel is necessary anyway. The phone feels good in the hand to me.Couple of minor dings here. The stock keyboard is terrible. Not a big deal, download Swiftkey app (or Thumbs Keyboard, or whatever keyboard app you prefer) and problem solved. Also, there is some bloatware on the phone but it's not excessive and doesn't really get in the way. When I first bought the phone I had it on wifi for a few hours downloading apps before activating, and when I finally activated the phone it performed a factory reset after updating, which was sort of annoying. The phone also rebooted itself over and over at first, maybe a dozen times, and lots of apps were force closing, but all of that stopped with the update; until then it was pretty annoying and I thought I'd gotten a lemon. After the update the phone is butter smooth and running without a hiccup. I would just advise that if this happens when you first get it be patient and let it get fully activated and updated before you freak out and send it back, as the updates seem to have fixed everything.All in all, this was a great upgrade from the Evo V. When considering this and the Galaxy S2 it was no contest for us; the hardware was pretty much a wash, and the phone size of the Victory was much preferred. Most importantly, the S2 uses Wimax, which gets blown away by the 4G LTE. The 4G LTE is IMHO reason enough alone to get this phone - it is simply fantastic. The phone itself is maybe 3.5-4 stars; it gets 5 stars from me because the 4G LTE network is really a quantum leap forward for the VM line. It blows everything before it out of the water, and puts you on the same plane as most on-contract users. I will be getting a Victory for myself soon. The VM offerings certainly have come a long way.Word is that the Samsung Galaxy S3 is coming soon to VM, and many might want to wait for that. If you like big phones I'd recommend waiting for it, because spec-wise it blows everything else away and will use the 4G LTE network. If you don't like big phones, though, then it's really hard to beat this one; A good description of it would be that it's like a smaller, slightly lower-speced Galaxy S3. I've gone the big phone route before and have since come back; I don't like having them in my pocket or on belt, and I like to be able to use my phone one-handed. This one fits the bill. Other than that, even considering spec differences, they all do basically the same stuff at this point, and the more powerful hardware is starting to reach a point where it's not too noticeable anyway unless you are doing high-end gaming.Be sure and check 4G LTE coverage in your area. Just Google \"Sprint 4G LTE coverage map\" and it'll come up.ETA 05/30/13: I couldn't resist it, went and bought myself one today. Activation was smooth as butter - first time ever in about 3 years of using VM that I have not had to call tech support to get it activated, the hands-free activation finally worked. I had none of the rebooting or other problems I experienced with my wife's phone. It recognized my 64GB storage card no problem. In a bottom floor room I am getting 3 bars on 4G with a Speedtest score of about 8 mbps down, and I go out on the balcony and with 4 bars I get 28 mbps down. Fantastic speed... Also, the battery is great. After a full day at work (9 hours total) with light usage I got home with a whopping 82% battery left over, the next day with fairly heavy usage I got home with 51% battery left. That is fantastic for an Android. I conditioned my battery twice before that, and I had to work to kill the battery before bedtime. I am overall very pleased with its performance, and I heartily recommend this one for anyone who wants REAL 4G LTE for cheap.ETA: 08/10/13: Everything is still running strong. Neither phone has had any significant issues. The 4G Network is still improving. There's simply no more affordable way to have 4G access with a decent smartphone right now. I haven't run into a single person on any other network who has similar features for a similar price. You can't beat this value.I'd still recommend this phone, especially since it's now $50 less than it was when I bought it.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Great Value, Bad Software Choices", "Author": "Michael Young", "ReviewID": "RA0891DL0096W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have a love-hate relationship with this phone.  First, what I love: Great price point value, 4glte, Jelly Bean, form factor, removable battery.  What I hate:  1) Unremovable bloatware like the useless Virgin Mobile Essentials, the Samsung app suite including the awful Touchwiz. 2) You have only 1gb of usable storage on 2gb of internal memory for your own apps, videos, music, pictures 3) Samsung decided to make it IMPOSSIBLE to install and run apps on your SD card, meaning their bloatware and bad decisions interferes with my ability to actually use my phone.Conclusion:  Frankly, it is unreasonable to barely offer any storage space on your phone, make your crap apps unremovable, taking up valuable storage space, and at the same time arbitrarily limit my ability to use an external storage.  I bought this phone outright, I did not rely on a carrier subsedy, this phone is mine, and limiting my use of your good hardware gives you a 2 star review.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really Nice Phone", "Author": "D.

My LG Optimus V was giving up. It came down to this Samsung and another LG. I had just gotten a Samsung tablet and liked the idea that this phone and the tab went hand in hand. So, I decided to get the Victory. I has been great! The storage issue people have complained about is related to Jelly Bean and not the device. What will go onto the external SD card works just fine. I've only downloaded a few apps that I have a use for. The bottom line is, if you are looking for an SIII/S4 or 5, this isn't it but it is a fantastic little phone on it's own. I have no problems with the camera(s), even got a great camera app other than the one it has which is good. Battery life is exceptional! The size is perfect and I am satisfied. Unfortunately, my area has not gone to Sprint's 4G LTE yet. Even so, it's doing fine on 3G and I have the Wi-Fi active so I pick up my network as well as others I trust when I'm out.

I decided to upgrade for a few reasons: My old phone was outdated and I kept running out of memory for apps. The old andriod(2.1 I believe?) was running slow and many newer updated apps would crash, the battery life was awful, and it only was on 3G.This phone has basically fixed most of my complaints about my old phone. The new OS runs smooth. Hopefully this continues and doesn't slow down too much as time goes on. I can install all the apps I want and they actually run. I still have plenty of space left too for the future. The battery seems great. I was always scared before to sleep with my old phone off the charger incase a call came in and I used it as an alarm. I haven't had any phantom battery drops and the option to view how you've used the battery seems to be accurate as on my old phone it would say like 55% of battery was used by the camera when I took one picture.I am also a big fan of the upgrades in the swype technology and it works much better than on my old phone. I also am very happy with the screen size. It seems very close to the Iphone 5. I can still type of the phone using one hand. I think the screens are too big on the SII and other models. It still feels small in my pocket, just a little longer.My one complaint so far is the 4G LTE. I have yet to see 4G LTE speeds and I live in an area that shows complete coverage by the 4G LTE map. No where in town have I seen this. I work in the downtown loop of Chicago which also shows full coverage and I am not getting it. Most of the time I am still on the 3G network. I sometimes get the 4G but I haven't seen LTE yet. Hopefully this changes. It kind of bothers me that I knew my phone rate would go up to $35 from $25 but I justified this by having better data coverage and I have yet to see it. I have not had any issues with the cellular service in terms of making/receiving calls.The phone is great, my only issues have been the 4G LTE (or lack of) service.

Can't ask for much more than that from Amazon, shopcelldeals, or Virgin Mobile itself.  Kudos to all three.As to the phone itself, it is an upgrade for me from a Kyocera Rise, this is day one, and it's my first phone without a physical keyboard, so it's a learning curve.  By now you should have read the reviews of it on Virgin's web site (as I have), and already know what to expect.  The phone did a system update almost immediately after powering it on the first time, and I'm just getting up to speed with the apps I had installed on my old phone.  So far it seems quick and responsive, I like the slightly larger (4.0\") screen, and the 4 or 5 games I've installed so far run with no issues.

My biggest complaint is the lag time from when you touch an icon on the screen to when it actually opens.  It takes a few seconds, sometimes several seconds which might not seem like much, but when you press something and it doesn't open, it makes you think something is wrong with the phone. In fact, it's just incredibly slow to respond.  To me that's pretty annoying. And when you want to use the camera, it takes a long time for it to load and open.  The next thing I really don't like is how smooth & shiny it is. It might look neat, but it translates to being very slippery, which is especially a problem if when you use the Navigation, you set it on your lap as you drive like I do.  The phone slips and slides ALL OVER the place, and the slightest tap on the brakes will send this phone flying onto the floor where you'll have to retrieve it from somewhere near the pedals (which is quite dirty in my car).  My LG phone had a slightly rubberized surface which was ideal for a mobile phone, I guess I'm just so used to that.  Slippery plastic seems like the worst possible choice of materials to use.  The third thing that really annoys me is that the navigation feature was recently changed--the layout, the menu, how it functions, it's completely different.  Now they use Google Maps which is synced to your computer (did I SAY I wanted my phone & computer synched?  NO!).  There are a lot more steps involved when you want it to navigate somewhere, which is another annoyance when you're in your car and don't want to have to press a zillion things just to start the Navigation.  The way it used to be was much simpler & easier by comparison.  This isn't Samsung's fault I guess, but it does add to my overall frustration.  Lastly, when you first start service with this phone, it automatically shows your voice mail messages in text format. I think this is a free trial of this for the first month, but I don't like it and apparently there's nothing I can do to get rid of it until the free month expires, which I'm anxiously waiting for.  I can't even call my voicemail to retrieve my messages!  Ughhh!!!  And the vm text feature isn't always accurate, it misunderstands some words that people say in their message.  Oh and the battery life isn't great.  My LG Optimus had much better battery life. And the touch screen on this phone isn't always very sensitive when I touch something deliberately, which is pretty ironic because... ...This phone has a super-annoying habit of opening apps and windows all by itself, just by sitting in my back pocket when I walk somewhere.  This seems pretty hard to accomplish, because in order to open an app, you first have to a) press the button located on the top edge of the phone to turn the screen on, and then b) slide your finger across the screen to unlock it.  Only then can you start opening apps, email, etc.  But oh no, somehow this phone manages to do that all by itself just sitting in my back pocket, even after I have locked the screen.  Today I took it out of my pocket to discover that it had turned on the flashlight app all by itself.  Seriously?!?!?!Oh one more thing, it only has ONE alarm clock ringtone, which is another annoyance because I depend on my phone as an alarm clock in the morning, and the only ringtone selection they have is a very mellow melody.  Most of the time I don't even hear it, even when it's tight next to my head, so I use my old phone for the alarm clock.  Why don't they offer more than one measly ringtone for the alarm???  My LG had about a dozen.Judging by the reviews, a lot of people seem to like this phone.  I guess it's a matter of personal preference, but as for me, overall I'm pretty annoyed with it. I'd return it but the 30 day return window just passed.

I spent a long time looking at reviews and ultimately decided that for the $250 I was willing to spend on a no-contract phone, the Samsung Galaxy Victory was the best choice. I could have certainly spent more on it's bigger, faster brother, the Galaxy S III but I couldn't justify spending $500 on a smartphone.The Victory is a very good middle ground choice in smartphones. It offers a decent processor with long battery life, 4G LTE, Android, clear sound, bright screen with impressive clarity and color, and is overall an attractive less-bulky little brother to the Galaxy S.The Pros:- Battery life. This puppy holds a charge. I rarely hit less than 45% battery life by the end of the day and usually am somewhere about 58%. I even tend to do a lot of Facebook messaging which drains the battery.- Size/feel in the hand. This is always important to me as someone with smaller hands. When I tried out different phones at Best Buy, so many of the more expensive phones were HUGE in my hands. So much so that using them one-handed felt odd and difficult. The Victory fits easily in the hand and, while not super thin, does not feel bulky or cumbersome to use.- Screen quality/clarity. The screen displays everything brightly and crisply. It is easy to read (although slightly small for large amounts of text), responsive, and generallyCons:- Storage is scarce. Get a SD card (if you don't already have one) and make it as big as you can afford. It doesn't solve the problem of the annoying lack of built-in storage but it'll help.- Key response is slow. The home keys at the bottom edge of the phone are somewhat annoying in their lag time. I frequently find myself double-hitting the home key (which brings up the voice search) because it lags in returning me to my home key.- Bloatware. The Virgin Mobile version of this phone comes with the standard annoying Virgin mobile bloatware.

If you've got good coverage and moderate needs, (300 min or less of voice) Virgin is a great deal, and this phone does everything you'd expect a modern smartphone to do.

Btw, I have had less than 100mb of ram left available and this phone was still snappy for me. This thing has dual band WiFi. I am on 5ghz at home the browsing the net is very fast. I did try 2.4ghz and it is good too. The bad thing is that you cannot transfer apps to the sd card. It is not the phones fault it is google's. They decided that this new version of android be like this.I have 32gig class 10 micro sd card and plays very well with it. It has all the features of the galaxy s2 and more. Video chatting with Tango on this phone is awesome. Whatever you do, don't let the virgin mobile live ID install. The Samsung interface is much more elegant than that junk. HD video is good as well as the pics. for complainers, if you want high quality, use a real camera you goons. I have not seen any cell phone out do a good camera. The size (4inch screen) is smaller than s2 but that is awesome for me cause it fits in my pockets OK. Use \"big buttons\" app for the keyboard, the stock kboard is small.

My boyfriend got the exact same phone and has the exact same problems. In the middle of some apps, the phone will restart itself. I've even had it do so once when I wasn't doing anything on the phone. I'll be listening to my music and suddenly every single song cannot be played because my phone says the music player doesn't recognize the format even though I've listened to every single song on my phone before. Restarting the phone fixes that problem. Also, Samsung apparently no longer wants you to move any of your apps to your SD card. To do so you'd have to root the phone or something and then download an app that will do it and the phone only has 2GB of storage, so I keep having to delete things. My music also will not go straight to the SD card, I have to go into \"My Files\" to move my music over every single time I download a new song. Also recently, the phone will not come on when my alarm is going off. The sound is going off and the vibration is going off, but the phone is black and does not light up. I have to unlock the phone to get to the alarm to turn it off or on snooze which is a pain in the morning when you are half asleep. I have not been successful in finding out how to use my own music as a ringtone, even ringtones I created with a ringtone maker. You can only select from what is already on the phone.The pros are that the camera seems pretty darn good and I like being able to take panorama photos. Not long after I got the phone, I started getting 4G in many places. The screen quality is nice as well. It's an Android so there's that...I would not recommend this phone. Get something that lets you move apps to your SD card because it will save you TONS of space. I mean, I bought a 32GB memory card when I bought the phone not knowing that, so now I have all this space on my SD card but no way to put the important things onto it.

I love the settings because I can connect to several devices by wifi and send documents or pictures through kies or bluetooth them.

I find the camera to be okay like most cellphones, it is not perfect.  Overall I rate this a 4 star because of being a new phone to me and I just getting used to it.  I am sure that as time goes I will find more liking or problems.  I had several other phones here from amazon that I had to return because they were defective before, I finally purchased this Samsung Victory.  I find that this phone is heavier than the lg optimus elite, and lg optimus f7, and motorola triumph.  However,  the screen is about the same size as the triumph.  You can download about as much apps on the samsung as the optimus f7, elite, and triumph.  I found this found to be on sale for 99$ so I got it at a bargain price because it is regularly a $249 phone.  I think that phones that in the medium price as a good as the higher end ones.  I find that Virgin Mobile offers less phone options than most carriers, but will insure the phones for up to 1 year from the date of purchase.  However, if you purchase a new phone you will get a used replacement if you go through them.  I use the $45 price plan and get enough mins to last over a month.

I am a very tech oriented person but also do not like to spend hundreds of dollars on cell phones because I am prone to dropping or losing them.  I have previously had an LG Optimus V, a HTC one and during my brief stint with AT&T; a Samsung Galaxy SIII.  This phone is worlds better quality wise than any of those phones except the SIII in which for obvious reasons it is identical.  The display quality is sharp and although the processor is only slightly better than the Kyocera and less than the SIII it is very quick and responsive.  Loved that it had many of the Samsung features I missed about my SIII such as Svoice and wireless data sync.  My only complaint with the SIII was that it was too large and bulky but this phone is just the right size for me.  I would have preferred a more physical home button like the SIII but the touch button on this is surprisingly responsive.  The speaker/sound quality is also very good. The front facing camera is not great as is the case with most phones,  but the rear facing camera is very nice for being only 5 MP would have guessed that it was more because the quality focus and flash compensate for it.  Overall for the price it is a great phone.  *Note I do see that some people complained about storage and not being able to migrate app data to sd card and I as of yet have not really messed with this because I use this more for data and pictures than apps but I will update once I test this.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Star Rating is for Virgin Mobile cellular service.

App Memory Limited.", "Author": "Robert A. Gilliam", "ReviewID": "R6Y8QZG7TQEIU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm enjoying this phone very much as it's my first smartphone, but I have to call BS on the 720p video. Samsung is simply lying putting that in the specs. Sure, it can create a video file with a resolution of 1280x720, but it's blurry crap. The actual visible detail is significantly less than my Cannon camera's 640x480 video. Looking closely at a high contrast edge in a \"720p\" video, the image is obviously a doubling and softening of 640x360. Interpolating to a higher resolution is a useful feature -- it turns ugly pixellated video into just blurry video -- but it ain't 720p. The specs should say 640x360 video with interpolation to 720p. But even that would be stretching the truth because the focus is so bad that even at 320x240, sharp edges are a little soft. (I did use the highest compression quality, superfine, during my testing.) The front-facing camera may actually be sharper, but it only shoots at 15fps. At least the 5mp photos are sharp right down to the individual pixels.It has a 4\" diagonal (actual viewing area) 480x800 multi-touch screen and a 1.2GHz 32-bit dual core processor.I copied 1,613,885,440 bytes to it in 1m50s over \"high speed\" USB 2.0. That's 14.67 million bytes/sec or 14MB/s.Without activating the Virgin Mobile service, the phone can still do everything except phone calls and texts. (And you can even do that, sort of, with VoIP apps over WiFi.) You can copy media to it over the USB cable. You can access the Web and the app store over WiFi. It can even be used as a GPS device. The free app NavFree lets you download map data for any US state and several countries and navigate without cell service. It only tries to activate cell service once each time it is powered on from being completely shut down, and you can just hit the cancel button.The audio quality from the 3.5mm headphone jack is somewhere between a cassette tape and CD. It doesn't have crisp high end even with the equalizer cranked. But that's actually above average even among dedicated MP3 players last time I checked. The built-in speaker is good enough to listen to spoken word material. Interestingly, it has microphones on either end and, when it shoots video, it records in real stereo at 48kHz and 128kbps.The 2gb limit on app storage could be a problem for some. It can use a microSD card (externally accessible, up to 32gb) but only to store music, videos, photos, etc.... (Some apps can store some of their data on the card. For example, NavFree lets you put your map data on the card.) But remember, when you buy an app from the Google store you can download it again without paying again. So you can delete a big game after finishing it and download it again months later to play again. There seem to be different memory set-ups. Mine came with 2gb of ROM and 2gb of RAM. Much of the software that comes with it seems to be on the ROM. It looks like less than 100mb of RAM is used by pre-installed stuff. Mine reports 1.73gb (1,857,573,356 bytes) total memory.Video playing tests:It plays 720x400 video @ 24fps compressed with h.264 @ 800kbps.It plays 1264x704 video @ 30fps compressed with h.264 @ 938kbps.It plays 1920x1040 video @ 24fps compressed with h.264 @ 1878kbps.Even though the screen doesn't have HD resolution, being able to play HD video without re-compressing is very convenient.With no running apps and the screen turned off (but the phone still powered up) the battery will last for days. Demanding apps can drain the battery in a few hours though. There's no reason to turn it off at night. Just put it on charge. It takes 35 seconds to start up from a completely powered down state.It doesn't come with a separate charger and USB cable. The charger has a large USB port on it. The single cable connects the phone to your computer or to the charger. It can charge from your PC's USB port, but not as quickly as from the charger. The phone has a micro-USB port, the smallest of the 3 flat sizes.The LED flash is very bright and even. It includes a widget flashlight button that turns it into a nice flashlight.The battery can be replaced by the user, though I don't think the delicate cover would survive daily battery swaps for long.It is slippery, but you can get an Aimo padded shell for it for $6 here on Amazon.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great For Casual Users", "Author": "Deborah McKinney", "ReviewID": "R3U63S1DDHHIP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does everything I need.

I was shocked by the prices of the \"premium\" 4g phones offered by my current cellular provider.  For the price of replacing the screen I could have gotten this phone!  I got a phone number with google voice and then used talkatone over wifi to make phone calls and completely avoided multi year cell phone contracts or spedning nearly 4 digits for a phone.  Got a mobile wifi device that can power the wifi only phone when I'm not home and it is free for 500 mb / month. For wifi VOIP and GPS this is probably completely doable especially if your workplace provides wifi for your mobile device.There are real problems with this phone and the biggest is the tiny 4 GB storage.  After installing my favorite apps I found that I am left with a little over 1 GB of storage left.  There is also no way to transfer these apps to an optional microsd card.  My friend had the exact same android version (4.12) and for some reason he had the option to move some apps to microsd.  I showed him my phone using the exact same android version and he was stumped.  There is no option to do this on the Victory.The other problem is the RAM.  After a day at work using email, talkatone to make calls, and amazon price checker, 706 MB out of 806 MB of usable RAM is being used up.WIFI voip Phone quality using talkatone on the victory phone is noticebaly better than cellular phone calls.  Talkatone voip quality was horrid using the asus memo pad HD 7 directly or with several different bluetooth headsets.The Victory's battery life is *FANTASTIC*.  My Droid Razr would struggle to make it through the work day without completely draining it's battery while the Samsung Victory with its 2100 mah battery (equal to the galaxy s3 battery) has 83% battery life left at the end of the day (7 AM to 6:45 PM).  Display brightness is set to less than 50% and the battery saver mode is enabled.  Turned airplane mode on and then activated the Wifi only.In addition to the fantastic battery life these battery are user-replaceable.  Such a relief after coming from a phone that would not allow replacing the battery.The notification volue is not loud enough.  Even at max volume it's easy to miss them because they are not loud enough.The 4.12 GPS navigation is actually easier to use than 4.3 version and I prefer it.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price!", "Author": "momofboys", "ReviewID": "R26E4FK6MMAO4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really pleased with this phone.

I've been using the Virgin Galaxy S3 for a while now, but that one's a bit too big for her tastes. We've thus transitioned from Virgin's HTC lineup to their Samsung line (previously having used the EVO V and One V respectively). In a nutshell, the Victory is the closest thing to the S3 that isn't as big or expensive. It is a strong compromise of relevant features and budget pricing.Some nice hardware features are a dedicated camera button and external micro-SD slot. On the S3 and EVO V, you need to remove the battery to take out the card; the Victory's side mounted slot is a lot more convenient. The Victory uses the exact same 2100 mAh battery as the S3, which gives it even longer battery life and also means you can use batteries interchangeably. It shares a lot of other features with the S3, including S-beam and NFC/Google Wallet, Android 4.1, 4G LTE, and the Samsung UI. I'm not a fan of all of Samsung's apps, but they do generally work well, and it's easy to install alternatives if you desire. It has enough CPU power and RAM to smoothly navigate menus and run apps.Downsides versus the S3 are a weaker rear camera and limited USB on-the-go support. I tried hooking up a few things that work on my S3, but the Victory seems to either need external power or simply lacks driver support for things like USB thumb drives. It does recognize that a USB device has been connected, but it fails to mount anything. As for the camera, it's both lower quality and a lot slower than the S3- it's comparable in quality and speed to the EVO V's. That isn't to say it's bad, but it simply isn't exceptional like the S3's. The Galaxy Victory also has considerably less onboard storage- 4 GB vs 16 GB, and with installed OS/apps only about 1.7 GB available. This is probably not an issue unless you're a gamer- if you are you probably should get the S3 if at all possible instead, as it's also a lot more powerful and has a larger screen. That said, the Victory's screen is smaller and not as high res, though the difference isn't hugely obvious. The Victory also lacks the S3's motion controls and special features like eye detection, though I've found most of those are more for fun than any real utility.Form-factor wise, the Victory is good. It's closest in dimensions to the EVO V- the same width and thickness but slightly shorter. Compared to the S3 it's about a half inch less in width, slightly thicker but lighter and nearly an inch shorter. The bottom part of the phone has a slightly raised lip in the rear that affords some grip. You'll probably want a case on this one though, as it does tend to be a bit slippery.The phone's screen is bright enough to be easily visible in most conditions and call quality is good. In areas with LTE coverage the network is very fast- a sight better than 3G or even the spotty WiMax that some like the EVO V use. The softkeys are touch-sensitive portions on the lower edge of the phone that light up and have raised symbols. However, unlike the S3 the home button is not a physical key and can't be used to wake up the device- you have to use the power button, which is located on the top right edge. It has physical volume keys and the battery back panel is a flush snap-on plastic piece.Overall, this is a good alternative to the Galaxy S3 if you don't have the budget for one and don't particularly care about downloading huge apps like games. It's of course not as good as the S3 in terms of hardware and functionality, but it's really not bad either- especially considering how much cheaper it is (at this writing, less than half the cost). It's also a lot more compact and comfortable for smaller hands. Bang for buck, it's definitely the better deal of the two and probably a better choice unless you absolutely must have a device with top performance and feature set.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Tasha Small", "ReviewID": "R1ZZLZ4QMABHGI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best phone i had and this is an upgrade from the HTC Wildfire S....

I pretty much bought a $249 alarm clock...because that is the ONLY thing that worked correctly on this phone and I've had it replaced by the company TWICE.I have lived in two major cities in the last year of having this phone...you'd think this would guarantee good service and signal by VM. NOPE.  They have \"recalibrated\" my phone to my living area multiple times, and guess what?  No 4G service (EVER), no more than 3 bars (EVER), and the wireless NEVER works.  My calls always drop (if I can get signal to call at all), my texts never send (and I receive them 2-3 days late from other people), internet (wireless OR\"4G\") is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SLOW.  Literally...it takes about two minutes to load Google results and another two minutes to load the page you want.Now onto the memory in this phone.  The phone I purchased had 8GB, I have external memory of 16GB on it.  Guess what?  The manufacturers apps (the ones you CANNOT remove) take up 5GB on your phone. YAY.  Worse?  There is no option to \"Move Application to Memory Card\" like the other \"smart phones\".  You literally just suck it up and hope they install on there before you run out of memory in the first week of owning your phone.Now onto the VM service you will receive.  It sucks.  9 out of 10 times, you will end up talking to someone who barely speaks English and literally knows NOTHING about your phone.  When they replaced my phone, I called them to activate (you have to cal to activate) and I got this Indian woman who kept telling me that I cannot have my addresses from my old phone put on my new phone.  It's impossible. (Well, I'm pretty sure that's what she said, I couldn't really understand her).  I had done this on two phones prior, I know it can be done.  I kept asking her to transfer me to someone else...SHE WOULD NOT!  Are you serious?  She WOULD NOT give me to someone else!  Finally I hung up and called again hoping to get another person, and I did.  They were no help either.  CONTACTING VM is ridiculous.  You either have to call and go through a maze of non-English speaking people, or you have to email and sit and wait about 5 days for a response from them.  There is no \"talk now\" option online (like Verizon), you literally have to wait for days no matter what.Online pay per month never works.  Every month my payment was set to pay automatically, EVERY month they have a problem with the payment (which by the way, they stop your service TWO DAYS before your bill date, and EVEN IF YOU PAY YOUR BILL they WILL NOT activate your plan for the month til the day of.  So....two days a month you have NO cell service) and you have to log in online and click \"PAY NOW\" like 5 times till it works.So. Good luck with Virgin Mobile.  Honestly?
