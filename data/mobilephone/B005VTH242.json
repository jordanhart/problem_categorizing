{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Secretly An Android Phone!", "Author": "Geiger", "ReviewID": "R1KG8UMWIHUW6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is marvelous! On the cricket website this phone isn't listed as an android but it really is (Android Gingerbread 2.3)! It requires only the $45 plan as opposed to the $55 android and smartphone plan as a result of this! A quick google search reveals details on how to root this phone. While android market is not included on this phone, there are other simple means to \"side-load\" android apps on it. Also take a look at some cricket user forums for more details on unlocking the full potential of this great phone.Now with the $45 plan you get Muve Music which is an unlimited music download service. Virtually every major record label is there so whatever song you want will surely be there to download. I even tried stumping it and searched for some of the most obscure songs I could think of and lo and behold downloads were available!This Phone has a great screen nice and bright and crisp! It's a resistive touchscreen but is super responsive and using a stylus on it makes a big difference and much more responsive.Sound quality on this phone is the best I've heard on any mobile device! True stereo surround sound with dual speaker. It's super crisp, clear, and loud as heck, so you can rock out with your favorite songs!Best of all IT PLAYS ANGRY BIRDS! lol yes with little or no slow down!I highly recommend this phone for all those people who want an android phone but don't want to spend upwards of $100 for one and then pay $60 or more for service. Also think of the Muve Music as an extra added on bonus to sweeten the deal!PS I have researched this phone for quite some time..... BUY IT HERE ON AMAZON!! IT'S THE CHEAPEST PRICE FOR THIS PHONE ANYWHERE! EVEN CRICKET'S SITE HAS IT FOR MORE MONEY!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "No significant complaints, so far...", "Author": "Koori", "ReviewID": "R20R8UH15NU1FR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first smartphone... albeit a lower-end one.  I love it.I've seen some complaints about the touchscreen being a bit resistive.  I have long -- but blunt -- fingers, and no fingernails to speak of.  I found it /was/ resistive, calibrated for actual touch, alone. I have a narrow stylus, and decided to re-calibrate it for use with that -- and haven't had a single issue, since.Only other thing I've noticed -- and this could just be my particular phone, and not an issue with the model, itself -- is that it can be titchy about the temperature.  Living in the Pacific NorthWet, winters here can be a bit... bi-polar, to say the least, and we'd been having a very odd, very cold late fall/early winter. If I keep my phone in my pocket (particularly one close-ish to my body), I have no problems.  If I keep it in an outer coat pocket --  let alone use it outside for more than 10 mins without actually being on a call -- in 35 degrees or lower, the screen locks up, entirely.  Though, with the former, it's only after coming in from intense cold if the apartment is stiflingly hot that does it.It stands to reason... they're heat /and/ pressure sensitive. But, it's not really been an actual problem.  More like a minor annoyance.  All I need to do is put it briefly into sleep mode (just a few seconds), and it's fine, once it comes back out.Other than those two things, there's just the general poor service coming from using Sprint towers, and some browser instability... which are not directly related to the phone, itself.All in all, the Chorus has been a pretty good phone for one so inexpensive (I only paid $30, for mine ^_^ ).", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price", "Author": "Kate M", "ReviewID": "R36V1WD8OK10XX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to switch to a cheaper phone plan and after reading the reviews for this phone the only concern I had was in regards to the battery life comments others had made. Well, I can't speak for anyone else's experience, but in the instructions it says to let it charge and go dead three times, and that worked perfectly for me. The first two times I didn't even use the phone and it ran down really quickly just sitting on the counter, but after the 3rd time, now it holds the charge for over a day, even if I'm listening to music a couple hours/day.I found it necessary to use a stylus when texting. The size of the numbers and letters for texting is just way too small and even with small fingers, it's easy to press the wrong one. A stylus greatly allieviated that frustration. Other than for texting I haven't had a problem with the touch screen. The sound quality for calls and for music has been great. Overall this phone is a steal for the price.When I went online to set up service with Cricket it was fairly user friendly, but one thing I thought was funny was at the end of the whole process when you're supposed to see your new phone number, that line was blank.  I had to call another phone at home to find out what my new number is.  That just made me laugh.  \"Here's your new number....\"  Oh.  It's blank.  Easy to find it out though.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "lluera", "ReviewID": "RGR4C3AABKF3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I couldnt be happier. I love my phone.

I just did not know how to use the phone. You have to make it sleep with the power button instead of letting the screen just close on its own. when the screen closes after 30 seconds or so its still processing everything except the screen. Thats why it dies near lunch time. From now on close the screen right away with the power button and open it the same way. DONT FORGET. Now you will see a major improvement in battery life and you dont have to kill all your apps either. Im giving it 3 stars just because its just really a phone not a real android phone.

I activated phone with mycricket.com when I received it. Upon activation, I inquired about porting my number and was told it could be ported. Once activated, cricket told me to call back in a week to port my number to this phone. My number was finally ported on August 20th. Since then I have been attempting to use this ZTE Chorus phone. Turn phone off attach charger and charge phone -- says complete 100% -- remove charger. Try and make a call -- have strong signal until I hit call button and it completely disappears. Finally, get to talk (using phone for 23 minutes, I have to hang up because phone is hot to the touch and beginning to irritate my ear also scares me. When I ended the call my phone shows 35% battery remaining. This is an every call issue. I cannot talk on the phone for more that 45 minutes without it going dead and/or getting hot enough to burn. Amazon.com says I can return the phone but I will not get a full refund. Yet, I cannot get an amount of what would be refunded. Not my fault or Amazon's that Cricket could not port my number and I was not using the phone. I would just like to get my money credited back. Then I will be able to get a phone and use it before my return time expires and make sure it is a good, safe phone. This is only one of several items I have purchased from amazon.com and it is the only one I have had a serious problem with and the only one that amazon is giving me a hard time about returning.

The phone itself is ok- generally easy to use, not overly complicated, but more bells and whistles than some others.  My service with Cricket has also been ok.  No dropped calls, but longer texts often don't send.  There doesn't seem to be a way to cancel sending, so it just keeps trying and draining the battery!  I think deleting the entire conversation thread stops it, but I'm not even sure.  The biggest problem though, is the battery.  After only three weeks, I don't even get five hours of stand-by time! I have to have the phone off unless I'm going to use it, or keep it plugged in!  It's kind of ridiculous, and a huge pain!

I called all the cell phone repair shops in town, but none of them could fix it, because they aren't able to get parts for the ZTE phones. So, I had to ship my phone to the Cricket repair place in Michigan, and even though it was under warranty, I still had to pay $15 ($5 to ship it to MI, $5 for the repair, & $5 to return ship it). When I got my phone back, the charger port seemed to be working fine, but the plastic protective cover to the port had been damaged (the decorative silver cover is gone).Also, the phone claims to come with a 4GB sim card, but what it doesn't say is that 3GB are for music downloads, & 1GB is for other memory. So downloading apps or storing photos can use that up in a hurry.I'll keep using this phone until I find something more durable (& can be repaired locally) that doesn't cost an arm & a leg.
