{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Customer Service - for a new but average product", "Author": "Mark Grant", "ReviewID": "R2XYVWRVRBH7IK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Digital Family X8 Wifi Java Smart Watch Mobile Phone Quad Band Dual Sim Cards 1.5\" Touch Screen Qwerty KeyboardMy assessment is that cell phone watches are still fairly new and they will get better in the future.06 NOV 13 - 4 stars is mainly for the Digital Family customer service.  The product is average of about a 3 to maybe a 4 stars. DigitalFamily Customer Service will work with you should you have any issues, be persistent - but they will work with you. Keep in mind they retail sell the product - they don't manufacture it.  Team, I received this cell phone watch on 28 OCT 13.  So a little over a hundred dollars gets you a usable but not perfect cell watch combo.  There are many different models on the market.  I bought this one because it has two sim card capability.  YOU probably can't get one right now that has all the features you want in one package.  I wanted two sim card capability, at least good water resistance, and a camera on the face of the device.  I got one of the three things I wanted in the device.  Keep this device out of the wet or damp weather it's not sealed - keep that in mind.After using it at Camp John Pratt in Afghanistan for the past 9 days I can say this about it.  Instruction manual is not that detailed so you'll have to figure out a few things on your own, like installing the sim cards.  Put them in face down - metal to metal contact and slide the holder tab forward and lock  the sim card in.  BlueTooth:  I am able to call out and receive calls using the Bluetooth feature with no problem.  As for the phone itself, I like the I can see the screen in sunlight, not great but well enough to use the cell/watch.  I have two sim cards and can receive and make calls on both, I can talk and hear fine using the built in mic and speaker but you'll still want to get a blue tooth device and make it work.  Get a basic blue tooth device if you don't already have one - not the latest on as it might not work on this cell/watch.My charger unit was faulty but DigitalFamily Customer Service did refund the cost of my having to buy a replacement charger unit.  Hopefully yours will work just fine. The charger is for 110V AC with 60Hz ONLY.  Be careful to note that for those of you who are in 220 V AC 50 Hz regions.Once again, be advised that the back is not sealed so take care and don't get the cell/watch wet.  If you wear long sleeves in wet/damp weather chances are it will be fine, but it does not like humid weather or fog so be careful and keep it covered.  In warm dry weather it should be fine.Get or make yourself a fine point stylus or get very used to the qwerty keyboard on the side of the watch.  It's needs to have a fine point so I made a stylus from a coffee stirring stick.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Junk, Junk, Junk", "Author": "Literadio", "ReviewID": "R1TBN6BAD651KG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Where do I start, the watch was poorly designed, and the fit and finish was pathetic.
