I was planning to gift this to my cousin who lives overseas. I ordered this phone and got it on time, but just 2 days before the journey overseas and when I tried to use the phone with a GSM sim, it said ... \"Activate it through Verizon\". When I called Verizon, they said that the phone was unlocked, but the seller \"Master Reset\" this phone before sending to me, and thus, it locked the phone again to Verizon. However, Verizon did not have the key to unlock - they wanted me to register for Verizon and after 6 months, they can unlock it - and asked me to call BlackBerry to see if they can help. BlackBerry customer service is a PAIN! They flat out denied any help to me. So, I had to return it, as I do not have enough time to go through the steps with the seller. Please buy this phone with the knowledge that you need to have a working session with the seller to re-unlock the phone after you get this. If you are already with Verizon, then go for it ... great phone!", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "Ranjeeve Ramsamooj", "ReviewID": "R713RPXLF9SPF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing product. i don't regret purchasing this phone.

I got it for free under contract and wasn't really interested in getting insurance for it because I have never made the mistake of dropping my phones into bathtubs before (first time for everything, right?) and so I decided to buy this.The Blackberry Curve 9370 (from Direct Wireless) is perfect for me! Why? Because:1.) I'm under Verizon Wireless so even if the phone wasn't GSM unlocked, it wouldn't matter to me. (I still don't know if it is GSM unlocked or not, btw.)2.) I'm a homebody and have easy  access to a computer, tablet, and wifi so the lack of apps on the Blackberry and the lack of touch screen/screen size on this model in particular isn't a big deal for me either. If I want to do heavy surfing on the internet, I'd get on my computer; if I wanted to play games/apps, I'll say hello to my Nexus 7!And 3.) The QWERTY keyboard is my favorite thing about the Blackberry and was really the deciding factor. I have family and friends outside of the US and we use Whatsapp a lot! While replying to texts/messages wasn't difficult on an iPhone 4s or a Samsung Galaxy Infuse and definitely not at all difficult on a Samsung Galaxy Note 3, I absolutely hated replying on a Motorola Droid Razr M even with Swype (all previous cell phones I have owned and used), and I still missed having a \"real\" keyboard. Since getting the Blackberry Curve, my family, friends and my husband have noticed how quickly I come up with replies. It's just boom, boom, boom. Reply, reply, reply. I LOVE it!Now, would I have gone with a Blackberry Curve IF I had gotten insurance with my phone plan... I'd definitely say no. (I LOVED my Note 3!) But I didn't get insurance with my phone plan and had to settle for a cheap alternative. Which is what this is. For $83, why the hell not? But if you really care about your apps and staying connected via 4g, don't get this. Stay away!
