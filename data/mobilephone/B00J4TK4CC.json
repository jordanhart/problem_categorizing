Since I didn't want to go back home to get it, I expected to get charged for a new one. But they made stuff up about me flashing it to get out of exchanging the defective phone.If you get this phone, DO NOT BUY FROM SHOPEBEST. Get it somewhere else. I got scammed for more than $700 and have nothing to show for it.Watch out for this fraudulent seller.I've already made a claim with Amazon, but haven't heard back yet.Edit: Finally got a refund, but I got hit with a $300 restocking fee. Contacted Amazon again, and they fixed it. I now have the full refund.

I then called the seller to confirm they had it in stock and it would be going out. They told me shipping cut off for the day was 5pm (plenty of time) and they were just waiting on Amazon to send them my order details to their computer system.The phone did not arrive until Wednesday April 16th. I am disappointed it took 5 days when i paid for one day shipping.Second issue was when i opened the package they sent me the SM-G900F model. As you can see they clearly state more than once in the item description they are selling the SM-G900H version. After researching the difference it looks like the G900F is supposed to have LTE bands 800/850/900/1800/2100/2600 MHz which the G900H does not have. However when i put my T-Mobile SIM in, i can not get LTE, I only get HSPA+.Third issue is the manufactures seal on the box was broken, the box had been opened. All of the accessories appear to be accounted for. The clear plastic static shields where still attached to the screen and back of the phone. However when i turned the phone on someone had already went through the setup screens. You know when you first turn on a new phone it ask you your language, owners name, basic setup questions, etc, before getting to the home screen. So i went into the settings and did a factory reset.Other then that the phone seems to be working fine, minus not being able to get LTE with T-Mobile.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Evolutionary NOT revolutionary!", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R3V1DOYDKL3FEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Oh, Another year, another set of phones from manufacturers!  I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. I will not call Samsung Galaxy S5 as revolutionary, but it is certainly evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. I love Samsung Galaxy S5 from its competitors for few reasons - removable battery, microSD card support and the maturity of the product. I have been using a S5 for past couple of days and have ordered a unlocked one from my local store. There are so many variants already in the market. So do check local specs. For example, in china market dual SIM S5 is available.Galaxy S5's back plate has a perforated dot pattern and a excellent matte finish. As a result, the phone looks far more sophisticated than its past designs despite its plastic build. Its surface feels nice to the touch without being too rough or too slippery.  I really do _not_ care about the plastic, in fact the lightweight nature is what I care. Some people make a huge deal out of it. A high quality plastic is good for lightweight and I go with lightweight than a heavy phone in the pocket. A reputed tech site called recently Samsung as the \u201cundisputed king of the Android smartphone space\u201d. True indeed. With the plethora of devices in tablets/phones, they have iterated so much that they can produce truly stunning products.If you care for weight, the Galaxy S4 is lighter than S5.  (please see my stats below).  In fact pixel density is slightly higher in S4 due to a 0.1in size difference. So get an S4, it is cheaper and still same phone that came out last year. If you care for heart rate monitor, fingerprint scanner, and water proof, get the S5. Otherwise literally similar set and you can save a lot by getting S4 now. Last year when S4 came out it was a great phone. It still is, though S5 came out now. Obsoletion is in the mind of the us, not on the devices.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don\u2019t advertize or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801,  MSM8974-AC  Processor:  Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version):  5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP,  Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU  Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5\u201d is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, but after using Note for a while, I don\u2019t use it as a primary phone.  The display in S5 is absolutely stunning with a Super AMOLED display and you have to see to feel it!ANDROID UI:S5 has Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. User Interface hasa flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently to my friends shows the details of processes. battery usage like which process takes up more battery, Qi charging receivers for wireless charging on Galaxy phones and they were in awe.WATER PROOF:Obviously I have not tested this!,  but a very nice to have feature and gives a peace of mindCAMERA:This can just replace a point and shoot camera. Wait, what is a point and shoot camera?! Very impressive. S5 has a 16MP camera with super-fast autofocus, HDR mode with real-time preview, and support for 4K video recording. Definitely state of the art.  I took several indoor photos and they look great. It will be interesting to see how photos appear in a vanilla S5 which Google will release.S-HEALTH:I rely and use S-Health more than any other app in my Galaxy S5. It has driven my fitness regimen to a very good progress and the design of app is nothing short of buttery and beautiful. I am often too in good favor of Samsung loading the phones with S-Ware, but their design of S-Health is definitely breathtaking. Heart rate monitor is a great addition to the fitness tools. I used it for walking several steps and found it same as in S4.PROCESSING POWER:Don\u2019t bother about it.  For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.Qi WIRELESS CHARGING:I wonder why Samsung does not release wireless charging built in. You have to get a external Qi wireless charger and open the back, align it and use with a Qi charger. It should be integrated, but you can do it after the fact.NFC Tags:Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. Get bunch (  I mean  around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example in my S4, when  I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both. I am programming my S5 also to do host of things.128 GB Micro SD card!!This is just incredible. If you see my reviews, I have been saying having external capacity is very key. With a 4K camcorder you can fill your space in a blink of the eye. Movies take up space. Who would have thought a 128 GB tiny card can fit in  a phone. This is just incredible. I tested with a 128 GB  and it works wonderfully! A 16 GB phone memory will have around 10 GB spare initially.OTG - USB Hosts:This is also often ignored feature in many reviews.  On the GO USB cable + S5 means you can use with external hard disks, and virtually many of USB devices. If you have a thumb drive and have files, you can in fact read with a phone and don\u2019t necessarily have to open  a laptop. works out of the box.BATTERY:Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don\u2019t. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!MISC FEATURES:I tested fingerprint scanner, but I am not sure how reliable it will be over time with scratches/oily fingers etc. I have to test it further, but for now I will settle on traditional passwords till bugs are ironed out.  Apple\u2019s initial fingerprint software had bugs which was fixed subsequently. There are so many other features in S5. Some of them have become so standard that they are not review worthy!  e.g., Infrared for wireless remotes, GPS etc. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up).To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), TOM TOM, , Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Currents (nice way to read News), Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they hve for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google VoiceAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S5.

Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs. With that out of the way, let's get to the point and the nitty gritty, shall we?* THE SCREEN - that is the very first thing you will notice when you look at the S5. Samsung has found its niche with AMOLED screens, which are BRIGHT & SATURATED. Everything almost literally jumps out at you, and sometimes even too much so. I had to switch to the \"natural\" setting, as the \"vivid\" and even \"standard\" profiles are too saturated(and FAKE) for me. It's better as a demo unit to draw you in, but for everyday use, I recommend switching to the natural profile.FACTS: The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Full HD resolution - 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~432 ppi pixel density, plus Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the screen from scratches.* The Look - the S5 has a more squared-off edges look than the S4, which is more squared off than the S3, but all three are not as angular as the S2. In terms of roundness-to square-ness, it goes from the S3 - S4 - S5 - S2 (the original S just looks like an iPhone 3GS). Check out my images for an easier comparison. The S5 is the tallest and widest, but not the thickest of the Galaxy S's. The best thing I can say about this is it's an evolution. Beauty is subjective, so judge for yourself. The front side is almost the same as any other Galaxy phone: You have the physical Home button, flanked by the \"back\" and \"menu\" capacitive buttons. Probably the most improved aspect of the design is in its functionality - it is now dust-proof, and water-proof up to 3 feet!FACTS: The dimensions are 5.59\" x 2.85\" x 0.32\"(142cm x 72.5cm x 8.1cm), and weighs 5.11oz(145g).* The Feel - Samsung has taken a lot of flack for making the Galaxy S line so cheap looking and feeling with its plastic bodies, for being the top Android phone maker. HTC has been known to have the best craftsmanship with their all-metal One phones. Perhaps Samsung feel they are so dominant that they don't have to spend more to mass-produce metal phones, but since they don't want to come off as too arrogant, so their compromise is a dimpled, faux-rubber backside like the Nexus 7(2012) and its very own Galaxy Note 3. It definitely gives a better feel - it doesn't slip and slide in your hands or pockets anymore - but it cannot compare to the feel and craftsmanship of the HTC One(both the m7 and m8). It is on the right track though, so let's hope that rumored luxury \"F\" line or next year's S6 will continue to get better.* How it Runs - This phone is fast, fast, FAST! With a 2.5gHz Snapdragon 801, it has the fastest processor out there right now. It terms of real speed, I cannot say if it is faster than the HTC One m8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it is definitely up there. When you touch an app icon to launch it, it launches nearly instantly. To really see how this phone flies, just open the gallery app and scroll through all your photos and you'll see what I mean. Usually the gallery is where most phones stutter as it tries to load all your photos and albums - but NOT the S5!* The Camera - FINALLY! Samsung has decided to make a decent camera, and not just as an afterthought. This 16mp camera is really awesome, so much better than the S4. I would always get washed out images with my S3/S4/Note 2, but with the S5, it actually looks like it's from a decent point-and-shoot dedicated camera with crisp, bright, and saturated images. Low-light shooting is also vastly improved, although not as good as the new HTC One m8. 16mp means 5312 x 2988 -resolution images, so you can actually blow them up or crop them down without fearing the dreaded pixelation monster. There are a myriad of other cool and useful camera features that I will save for you to find out(like macro and \"Google Street View\" modes :]). And lastly, the focus is quick, quick, QUICK! Nearly instantaneous focus allows you to capture those hard-to-capture moments easier. A definitely thumbs up to Samsung for paying attention to the camera and its functions.* Software - I'm still trying to figure out everything, as there is A LOT of stuff under the hood. Samsung's TouchWiz user interface this time around is A LOT less intrusive though, as much as can be without being totally stock Android, I guess. The layout and iconography are flatter and simpler, and for the better in my view. There is also a new sensor on the back, just beneath the camera lens. It is a heart-rate monitor/pedometer, and it comes with its own health app called S Health. There is a new battery-saving mode which can save you precious minutes when you're caught in a bind. All in all, I think this version is a lot nicer-looking, more responsive, and better than the precious S phones.The ultimate question is whether this phone is a worthy upgrade over the S4. As my review title suggests, it is an evolution, an incremental upgrade over the S4. So with that said I cannot whole-heartedly recommend it if you already have a good phone, or even over the S4. But I do feel this upgrade is more vast and much better than from the S3 to the S4, so in that sense Samsung has done a much better job this year. If you are switching from an older phone that was made at least 2 years ago, then I would tell you jump right in and try the S5 - it will not disappoint you. But for those with already a good phone, and/or say you just finished year one of your 2-year contract, then I would say think hard before you make the leap. For my money, I think the Note 4 and S6 will be the bigger upgrades more worth waiting for.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super phone - Great camera!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Dan\"", "ReviewID": "R15SUZIJJLWF8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was switching from an S4 to an S5.I have to say I'm very impressed!!Phone meets all my expectations.The camera is incredible.Browsing is fast & it seems to have a better Wi-Fi connection than the S4.I get coverage where the S4 does not.There is a bit of a learning curve finding things that are different than the S4.Getting rid of the Samsung news page just took a simple Google search.Very annoying feature but easily eliminated if you don't like it.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Needs work but can be fixed", "Author": "Fit4Life", "ReviewID": "R14OY962Q60KI2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It appears that Samsung is trying to market to the fitness and outdoor crowd. The hardware is good with a screen that can be seen in sunlight and a body that is water and dust resistance; however as a new owner of the Galaxy S5 with a Gear Fit I am severely disappointed. The problems can be easily fixed with a software update but in its current state I would suggest buyers look elsewhere.S Health:1. Needs to allow indoor exercise like weight training, spin classes etc. during indoor mode GPS would not be used. Attempting to do a work around by just selecting an outdoor exercise while exercising indoors  will not work either. For example trying to use S Health with Running selected as the exercise on a treadmill causes the phone to continually search for GPS which kills the battery. Calories are also calculated from the GPS so calories burned is a useless number.  With an indoor mode calories can be calculated from Heart Rate or Accelerometer. Currently S Health only allows for 4 outdoor exercises. If used indoors or doing stationary exercise S Health will produce inaccurate results making the S Health app all but useless. I did a 2 hour Hard to Max effort exercise  on a Step mill. During the exercise I monitored Heart Rate on both a laptop running Firstbeat Athletic and on the Galaxy S5 with S Health.Firstbeat on Laptop: 2231 caloriesS Health on Galaxy S5: 15 calories2.  Firstbeat Athelete is a software that monitors Heart Rate and uses algorithms to calculate a number of fitness related data results. It is a great software to have built in to the Galaxy S5 but S Health has hobbled it. S Health needs to allow setting Training Effect  to 5.0 if user desires. Currently S Health only allows TE to be set to 3.5. S Health needs to allow time to user desired Training Effect to be used as an option in the viewable items area along with Heart Rate, Duration etc. The time to TE is a great motivator. The data is already there and simply needs to be allowed as an option to display.Gear Fit:Severely restricted and will not work with most 3rd party apps.IR Remote:Not user friendly and very hard to use. At least there are 3rd party apps that function well with the built in IR port but plan on spending another $6.99 if you don\u2019t already own one.So in summary Samsung has produced a good base for a phone that will fit the needs of people into the outdoors or wanting to stay fit, however until Samsung fixes these major issues I suggest buyers wait to see if the competition will come out with something that has both good hardware and usable software. Samsung can fix most of the issues but they will need to do some major updates to the software. Let\u2019s hope they do, however until then look elsewhere. It would probably be wise for Samsung to make these fixes before the new Iphone comes out if they are hoping to convert over a few isheep.I do not work for any of the companies mentioned in theis review. I do not normally take the time to write reviews but my goal on this one is twofold.1. Warn buyers that the $800 or so that they will spend on a new Galaxy S5 and accessories will not really buy them a good fitness monitering device. Decent phone yes, but not really better than any of the others on the market. In fact with S Health and the wearables so hobbled there are probably many better, however this phone can be one of the best with the right updates.2. Hopefully Samsung is reading these reviews to see what it needs to do to out sell its competitors and will do it. I intend to keep my Galaxy S5 for at least a year to see if they do fix the issues, however with what I now know I would not make the same purchase decision right now.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "John Boss", "ReviewID": "R3O5IGFU697OC3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved it is really good i really loved it BEST PHONE I EVER HAD!!

Product arrived on time, box was sealed properly, and I did receive the G-900H.My slight annoyance is the convoluted labeling scheme for all of these models. I tried looking around before purchase, and found several sites with model number specifications, but they contradicted one another. I even looked through Samsung documentation, and there were several regional variants for the G-900F, from Europe to Asia, none of which details I was finding listed on Amazon.The G-900H model I received said it was for the Americas, meaning North or South. I registered at an AT&T; store, they changed my number over, SIM card works fine, the phone has been great. Except there's no LTE or 4G features, which I don't mind too much. I'm currently in Mobile, AL, coverage for all carriers seems to be hit or miss depending on where people are, but I am in confirmed 4G/LTE/whatever marketing crap higher-than-3G-newest-thing coverage area. My phone doesn't go above H+ (which is HSPA+ for all you non-technical people out there. Coincidentally, knowing that also means nothing to you, like most of the planet.)So why would Samsung make a product in 2014 without the ability to have 4G capabilities? No idea. Probably the same reason they don't feel like having, or following, basic and simple standard labeling system for people to know what their phone is capable of.In general, the phone is working great. The real test will be in a year, after a couple of updates, to see if it bogs down to a painful pitiful joke like my Note II did.

Who the hell is testing your prototypes? We don't all wear suits like you! most of us are a blue collar working class that put our phone in our pants pocket.Please revise software to allow us to disable home button from waking phone up.And NO!

Very disappointing...", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Surprised it's not made in North Korea", "Author": "The Nihilest", "ReviewID": "R3MX84DVR5BQB9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I hadn't bought a new smartphone in 3 years, so I hadn't realized how far downhill they had gotten.  I truly regret this purchase and feel obligated to warn others away from it.  Some of my review is based on the version of Android that comes with this phone, but since it's an integral part of the phone and unavoidable(if you're not rooting) then it's equally valid.  I should also warn you, I'm one of those weirdos who wants to actually have some privacy, and not share every single detail of my life with Google, Facebook, Samsung, Twitter, the NSA, every app in the Play store, etc. etc.  I would rather manage my own data than give it away to these companies to sell.  I honestly can't fathom why the flashlight app \"needs\" to track my GPS coordinates for example(my GPS was turned off before any SIM card was inserted).First of all, let's be honest here - although you're buying this to be a phone, it was not designed and built to be a phone.  This is a datamining device, plain and simple.  Whereas in pervious smartphones that was an underlying issue, on this, it is front and center.  Its function as a phone is pathetic at best.  Speakers crackle at even moderate volume, very slow to connect even at 4 bars of reception on both ends(I guess it takes time for Google, Samsung, the NSA, and all your apps to connect and get the data they want from your calls), terrible sound quality.  It reminds every day of the old MASH episodes watching Radar cranking the old phone and yelling into it at Sparky(set in a mobile army camp in Korea in the 50s...terrible phone reception even on wired lines).Like I said, datamining.  I made it a point to go through all the options on this phone before ever putting in a SIM card.  And it's a good thing I did.  Every single setting that could harvest your personal data is set to do so by default.  You're literally \"sharing\" EVERYTHING you do with this phone. This goes far beyond what I can reasonably cover in a review here, but I'll give you an idea.  With this phone set to default settings, and being tricked into using it like the makers intend(see contact pics, below), you're sharing:your exact physical location at all times;the names, addresses, phone #s, email addresses and faces of every family member, coworker, friend, business you deal with, acquaintance, etc.;credit card info(why do you think it's worth it to your carrier to \"give\" you a $50 gift card to get you using the NFC \"Smartpay\" app?  Because they're getting more than $50 out of you if you use it.);every picture you take;every entry into your calendar/dayplanner, etc.;every memo you write;the contents of your emails and texts;your fingerprints;your heart rate;whether you are actually looking at the screen at any given time;every single sound you make(voice command features \"have to\" be able to listen to you at all times);Now these are just the obvious ways they datamine you.  But let me give you less obvious examples.  The handling of pictures is a perfect example of this.I, and probaly you, take pictures with my phone.  Being that it's a 16 MP camera, and always with me, I take a lot of good pictures I want to keep(and lots I don't).  However, I like to keep my pictures my own.  I don't upload them to the proverbial \"cloud\".  My pictures are my property, not Google's, Facebook's, Picasa's, etc.  Good luck with that.  Your phone is set by default to upload every picture you take to a web service(you get to pick which web service - what freedom, deciding which corporation gets first dibs on selling your info!).  I never picked one.  Later, after having my phone set up and SIM card in, I wondered why I hadn't been getting any emails(I normally get lots).  I tried manually syncing my email.  Nothing.  It turns out that it was automatically trying to sync my photos with my Picasa account(don't have one, never have, and nobody else uses my computer or phone).  Since I don't have a Picasa account selected, no email for me.  In this instance, unchecking a couple more boxes(well hidden ones) took care of it and now I'm allowed to sync my email.  But by default, and without serious searching, you can't get emails without giving all your photos away.But it doesn't end there.  Because I take pics, I want to be able to, oh I don't know, LOOK AT THEM.  No deal.  The built-in app, Gallery, is junk.  It'll just arrange any image file on the phone into a jumbled mess with no useful sorting options(I have to look through hundreds of album covers from my music collection to look at pictures I've taken - no way to separate them.  Really.)  No you can't organize them into folders.  So you're left downloading a different app to look at/sort/deal with your pictures.  Except in Android now, you're not allowed to use 3rd party apps to move/delete files on your SD card, which is probably where most of your files are.  So it's either the 100% useless Gallery, or nothing(in other words, nothing vs nothing).  I've had this phone about 3 weeks now and still don't have a way of organizing photos into folders and still be able to look at them, without it being 100x the work it needs to be.  Same goes for your music, other documents, etc.The lame excuse behind this is that it's more \"secure\" somehow, not letting apps have access to your memory card.  Bull.  It's still okay for every app to read you memory card, track your location, record every single thing you do, but if YOU want control over your memory card, that's not secure?  Obviously what it's really about is getting you to put more of your data on the \"cloud\", giving it to the corporations.This photo talk reminds me of another way in which the S5(Samsung/Google) are going out of their way to sneakily datamine you.  Obviously it's big money to get their hands on your data, and if they can get you and your friends'/family/coworkers' faces entered into their facial recognition software, even better(for them).  So when you're making or receiving a phone call, or text message, there is this HIDEOUS cartoon face taking up most of the screen.  It's truly terrible, one look at it and it's obvious you were never meant to like it. There is no option to get rid of this cartoon face, except to enter contact photos.  You're seriously going to immediately want to get rid of this cartoon(look it up online, everyone hates it), but the only option to do so is give away your contacts' faces to the corporate datamine.  Of course you can put in other photos unrelated to people's faces, but it's a lot of work just to not have to look at this deliberately bad cartoon face every single time you use your phone.They claim battery life is better than in previous phones.  What they mean is the battery is bigger, and can store more power.  The fact is, the phone runs more bloatware than previous versions, and burns far more power than previous versions, and as such, the battery lasts no longer than before.  Although the phone supposedly has 1.8 GB of RAM, it is always running over 1 GB, even at idle, with no apps whatsoever running(excluding the bloat you can't turn off of course).  Speed is terrible.  It's noticeably much, much slower than my S2 was.  Movement in graphics is often very choppy and frankly pathetic.Another thing is that apps/services/etc. don't shut off.  Literally everything you do on this phone stays running unless you close it in the Task Manager(which you'll have to look for - they kept it hidden and FAR less functional than previous versions).  It must be a lot harder to datamine a closed app than an open one, because what possible advantage could there be to having EVERYTHING RUNNING 100% OF THE TIME?!  On a related note, if you sign in to the Play Store app to get an app, you are signed in forever.  Literally.  There is no way to sign out if you've gone in through the app.  Again, since they always claim \"security\" when they take function away from the user, what security(or any other function) is there in not being able to sign out, ever?  And of course there is the usual nonsense, wherein if you sign into one Google service, you're signed into 100 other things without meaning to or wanting to.  Check you gmail?  Now there'll be a permanent record of everything you ever watched on Youtube.Additonally, the phone itself is cheap plastic junk.  I don't care what the numbers say as far as screen resolution and colour; the fact is everything looks washed out and ugly compared to my old S2.This phone is not just a terrible phone, it's a slap in the face of everyone who thinks freedom means more than the right to be ignorant.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "samsung s5", "Author": "miriam", "ReviewID": "R3BQBNRUPA2S3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a very good devise, that as all new phone in the market, gives new features to all of us.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.99", "Features": "5.1\" Full HD Super AMOLED?
