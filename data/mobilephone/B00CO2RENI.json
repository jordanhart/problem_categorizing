The best buy I've ever made in Amazon. Plus to its capability as a S3 smartphone, it has these beautiful flowers that make it so cute. Besides it's fancy and very feminine, also has a very quick processor and works perfectly in Venezuela. The only thing I'd change is that its OS doesn't has Spanish as a configurable language. I tried to install the Morelocale tool in order to set the phone in Spanish and it did work, but the language just wasn't well translated, so the best option was leaving it in English. Anyway, I still love it and recommend it for sure.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R3B9HN77NOQNS5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone!!

This does everything the other did but the battery lasts longer and it fits in my hand (pocket and purse) WAY better. I used to have to hold it in one hand to dial with the other. This one fits me. Everything is in Korean, change the settings as you do the initial set up. Not sure if there was a warranty since I can't read the paperwork.
