{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Android Phone Ever", "Author": "Kjack", "ReviewID": "R12S4P2JUBCBGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great but I am pretty upset ... Why? Because I will never be able to use a smaller screen again. Just kidding but I bought this from Amazon because I got bored with my iPhone 4s. I've been with iPhone since 2007 and me leaving for Android was something I was real hesitant to do, but that big screen was tempting, I decided to do it and don't regret it one bit. Even though the unlocked Note has a faster processor, this phone is still super fast and has blazing fast LTE. My only concern was the battery life and I am even happy with that. I can go a full day and some on a single charge. Of course I rooted the phone and added a custom rom so I expected this (custom roms are more battery friendly then stock Android). When I was on stock I could still make it most of the day with moderate-heavy usage (By heavy I mean internet, twitter, instagram, messaging, music, it was just non stop usage). The camera is great, photos look amazing even in low lighting, and the screen is like an HD television. You can even buy a bluetooth keyboard and and hook up a mouse to use this thing like a computer! The S pen is a great feature even though I don't use it much. The only real complaint I have is how long it takes to charge which is around 3 hours, I mean you have to expect it because the battery is HUGE (2500mAh) so yeah it takes awhile to charge. After the first few battery cycles however charging time will improve. Anyway the phone itself is just a beautiful sight to look at, I get compliments everywhere I go like \"Whoa look at the size of that thing!\" no but seriously everyone is shocked at the size and then they instantly love it. In all honesty I was a bit nervous when I first received it because it really is a big phone, but after a week I viewed it as a normal size phone and everyone elses as too small (seriously I can't go any smaller now), and I would even considered going bigger. I can't wait for the Galaxy Note 2 which is rumored to arrive in December. Honestly if you don't care about 4G LTE (because that's the AT&T; Note's specialty) then I would get the unlocked Galaxy Note N7000 it has a faster processor and better battery life. Both are great phones however, and I wouldn't trade this thing for any other phone not even the new Samsung Galaxy S III. It's the best Android phone ever!", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works on Tmobile T-Mobile T Mobile", "Author": "Fausto Fondeur", "ReviewID": "R2M2HXEVSCN159", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just want to add that this phone is unlocked and works on T-Mobile prepaid plan.I'm getting 4G LTE, on NJ.Also,To update to Jelly Bean 4.1.2, just install Samsung Kies, it's a free app from Samsung.Connect the phone, and after connecting to it, it will request to update.I personally recommend that after an update you do a factory reset to delete anything left from the previous 2.3 android system.Phone worked so much smother after doing a factory reset, as recommended by Samsung support (found it online on a forum).Finally, all the ATT apps can be disabled.Just go to Setting -> Application Manager -> ALL (you need to swipe right to get here) -> click on the APP, instead of having a uninstall option, you will be able to disable them.That's it!Hope it helps someone, as for me it was a trial, I couldn't really find simple answer on the internet.I didn't load any modem driver, rooted, etc.This is unrooted and stock.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for me!!", "Author": "Fadkar", "ReviewID": "R36X9E7DH56OR6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "let me begin by saying that this phone isn't for everyone. Don't be scared off due to its large size because if you use your phone as a multimedia device for watching videos, reading articles, reading books, playing games, sending emails, etc. then this is the phone for you! if you use a phone STRICTLY as a phone for calling and texting then perhaps a smaller phone is better.The fact is that there are tradeoffs with every decision. getting this big of a phone has a tradeoff of portability and a little convenience. it still does fit in my skinny jeans, however this is more of a two-handed phone. and thats perfectly fine for me because i believe that its worth using 2 hands if i get to enjoy a screen so beautiful and large!although large, its very slim, and smooth. i love it.pros:-the screen is very beautiful and large-resolution of 800x1280-Super Amoled HD screen means that colors are gorgeous, vibrant, and saturated!-slim! so it still fits in my pockets!-Very smooth performancecons:-uses a pentile matrix...this really isn't an issue unless you plan to view your phone from a 170 degree angle. there is no discoloration unless your looking at the screen completely from the side with you eyes level with the screen.-for some reason, there is a discolored patch when taking up close pictures of white objects. I'm not sure why but this isn't an issue when there is adequate lighting and if the object of the picture is further than 2 feet away.overall: an amazing phone! i would definitely recommend!", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a REAL SAMSUNG", "Author": "Rachael Ray", "ReviewID": "R1RB9KG93ZC7B6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone thinking it was an authentic Samsung Note I717 however when I received it I noticed quite a few quality flaws: the back didn't quite fit, the speaker at the top of the phone jutted out of the space slightly, the back lighting on the home and back buttons could be seen through the adjacent seams (not so with any of my other Samsungs),  sms lagged in sending and receiving, connectivity issues with my wifi...some of those things can be explained but when I noticed it was MISSING the \"Samsung\" logo that should have appeared above the back and home buttons, I began to suspect. I decided to try and track the MAC address (you can find this in wifi settings under advanced) and discovered it belonged to Matura ([...] and not Samsung. I'm no tech wizard but these phones are either totally fake or immeasurably refurbished beyond recognition. $279 price is TOOOOO much for a rip off.

Most of the reviews left for this phone let me down. I was very pleased to find a phone with great specifications and an unbeatable price, but reading the reviews made me think twice..

My carrier was tmobile and it worked fine when I inserted my sim. Everything was just as i hoped! Then the battery life was acting up. The battery just drains by itself....it may be due to the gigantic screen, so buy a 3000mah battery just in case.

Also, I have problems with several applications turning themselves off and defaulting to the home page and sometimes not working at all.

I used the stylus to jot notes.Then the problems...It was always sluggish in all aspects, opening apps, changing from different apps, the picture gallery in particular was always slow.  My wife's IPhone was much quicker.  The camera did not perform well in low light. The camera was slow to launch.The screen was hard to read outdoors, the battery life got worse and worse.  Despite swapping between two full sized batteries I could rarely get more than 10 hours of use.The \"sluggishness\" escalated despite resets. The S note app was so slow to open and close I stopped using it.Worse of all, the GPS started to fail intermittently then persistently.  I learned to repair the GPS myself by opening the case.  Not just removing the back panel but exposing the circuit board by prying the phone open.  I would lift the two \"C\" shaped GPS contacts so they made better contact with the antenna embedded in the back panel.  This would improve things markedly for about 4 weeks, but, I suspect, because the back panel is soft plastic, these contacts would be pushed down again and lose contact with the antenna.  The GPS would start to fail again, eventually completely .I had the orginal Samsung Android Captivate on AT&T; and it too had major GPS issues.

The first time I ordered it, it came from Tablet Distributors, & I received it right before going on vacation. I found out on vacation that the charge port on the phone was bad by going by an actual AT&T; store & them diagnosing the problem of why the phone would not charge. In order to have a phone on vacation Amazon told me I would have to buy another one & send the first one back. After finally getting the second one, from Cell Floor, I opened it & found that it was in fact NEW. The first one obviously was not NEW, as advertised but USED. The first one not only did not come with all the manuals but it came with a completely different charge cord & adapter. I did not realize until I got the second one of how it was suppose to be packaged & what was suppose to come with the phone. I should have known better. The back was just laying in the bottom of the box with no kind of wrapper around it or anything. I don't know how many times they have tried to sale that same phone but they need to retire it because it is BROKEN & USED! I will be sending the first one back soon, since I am finally back from vacation & Amazon said it must be sent in it's original packaging. I'm hoping I receive my money back asap because it's not a cheap phone especially for having to pay for it twice. I will say Amazon was quick to help when we were in a pinch.
