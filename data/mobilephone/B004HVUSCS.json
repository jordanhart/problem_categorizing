Because Walmart carries this, I figured it would be consumer-friendly because Walmart actually vetts their sources. If you happen to do all the procedures right for a new SIM card, you may be lucky and get some service and be oblivious to the bad system underneath.If you don't fully understand their procedures (which are not always worded clearly), and you make a mistake, then need to call \"Customer Service\" to get it corrected, then your misery will begin.I bought the $45.00 service as a \"test\" to see how it worked. After paying for the SIM card too, I am now out BOTH the $45.00 and the cost of the SIM and \"Customer Service\" will not give me my money back or give me the service which I never used.There is much detail to this story, and if asked, I will update it with the cronology, but safe to say that some SIM cards that are sent to you may already be \"activated\" and they expect you to use it immediately - even though they don't tell you this.Even though there was no usage of my SIM card, they took my money and will not give it back and will give no credit to the account. When I asked them who had activated the SIM card, they didn't know, they said they couldn't retrieve those records. When I asked them to look and see that there had been NO phone calls or usage on the SIM, they said they didn't know and couldn't retrieve the records. With so little access to records that would PROVE that the SIM was never used, their operation looks like a one-way set up - to their advantage.

And finally they sent  software to our phones to stop us from going online and we cannot upload anything at Google Play or elsewhere. And Straight Talk says they did all this because we used too much data. Too much? All our $45 plan cards we purchesed said the services were \"unlimited\". And considering we made no more than 2 phone calls a month, used no texts at all and only listened to a radio show 2 hours 3 times a week they say we used up our \"unlimited\" service and then some.

I have spent the last two days talking with customer service trying to get my phone to register the reserve plan I added on line. To make things worse, 200 of the minutes I spent talking with customer service were deducted from minutes I purchased. Everyone I spoke to insisted that I call back on another phone to resolve my problem. I did not realize that when I signed up for Straight Talk, I would be expected to have at least two phones in order for them to be willing to help me.Yesterday, I was talking on my Straight Talk phone when it beeped and displayed a message that I only had 7 minutes of talk time left. No problem, I thought. I went on line and activated my reserve plan. I got a message that my order was processed and printed the order summary. But then I noticed that my phone did not recognize the updated plan. I still had only 7 minutes of talk left. I spent those 7 minutes speaking to customer service about the problem and they kept insisting that I call them back on another phone. I kept repeating that I had no other phone. That used up the 7 minutes and the phone went dead in the middle of speaking to customer service. I then tried to resolve the problem using on line customer service but they just told me I had to call customer service. As I have stated before, I have no other phone. I decided to go to the nearest Straight Talk retailer which was the Walmart store at 18551 North 83rd Avenue, Glendale, AZ 85308. I asked if I could use their phone to talk to Straight Talk customer service. Even though I bought the phone directly through Straight Talk and not through Walmart, the employee at the walmart Wireless boutique was gracious enough to let me use their phone. I spent 10 minutes punching in perhaps 100+ digits in \u201ccodes\u201d on my phone dictated to me by the customer service representative, which did not solve the problem. Then I was put on hold waiting to speak to a supervisor. After waiting for 30 minutes, I realized that no supervisor was ever going to speak to me and I did not want to tie up Walmart's customer service desk phone any longer, so I finally hung up.. Then I got the lady working in the wireless boutique to call StraightTalk on my behalf. After about 15 minutes talking to Straight Talk, she was able to get 1000 minutes added to my phone but the end service date remained the same as on my old contract. I had only 3 service days left.Today, I called Straight Talk customer service again. I spoke to multiple representatives, including two supervisors at the Straight Talk customer service center in Cebu, Phillippines. The supervisors were Cherry Delmar and Raymond somebody. Both of them talked me in circles for about 175 Straight Talk minutes. They kept insisting I call back on another phone. I kept saying that I had no other phone, that I already had called them on Walmart's phone the day before without resolving the problem. I told them I refused to drive back to Walmart to use their phone again as that would be further abuse of me as a customer and to Walmart who had no obligation to let me use their phone since I had not purchased the phone through Walmart. I praised Walmart as being the only entity that had given me any help at all and they were under no obligation to help me. They were only doing it to be nice. Plus, why should I be asked to repeat what I had already gone to a lot of trouble to do yesterday. It didn't work yesterday so I saw no reason to have to repeat the same thing that already had been demonstrated not to work. They just kept repeating that I had to call back on another phone before they would help me. They must have repeated this some 50 to 60 times. It was unbelievable!!!!! I kept asking WHY they could not help me some other way. FINALLY, Raymond conceded to dictate to me the 4 codes that I had to type in to my phone, a total of 102 digits. I wrote down the codes, hung up on Raymond and entered the codes as instructed. Voila, my updated reserve plan finally was registered on my phone. Yay, I now had another month to plan my escape from Straight Talk and keep my same phone number.I am beyond disgusted by this whole experience. First of all, why didn't the on line update of my reserve plan work? Why is the customer expected to have an alternate phone in order to address Straight Talk's inability to process my on line transaction? Why do customers have to enter 102 digits of \u201ccodes\u201d to correct the problems? Why were the customer service representatives, their supervisors, and their supervisor's supervisors so resistant to helping me in any way that deviated from their prepared script. Why did I have to fight SO HARD just to get them to tell me the stupid codes so my phone would finally work? Why were they so insistent on only telling me the codes on another phone?So far no one has apologized to me or offered me any compensation for the abuse I have received at the hands of Straight Talk Customer Service. Perhaps something on the order of free phone service for some period,  say 6 months, is in order? I don't know. I just know that Straight Talk views their customers as idiots and their customer service reps are  amazingly steadfast in not accommodating customers in any way.Oh! I didn't even mention how I managed to even get a customer service representative without being hung up on. When asked by a computer-generated voice to state the number I was calling about, I found that if I stated my number it would reply that I should call back in 15 minutes and hang up on me. This happened three times in a row. The fourth time I decided not to reply with my number. Instead I used the nonsense phrase \u201cblah blah blah.\u201d Literally. And the voice would repeat the question 3 times so I would have to say \u201cblah blah blah\u201d three times. Only then was I put through to a human. I had to use the \u201cblah blah blah\u201d trick every time I called after that.  This meant I had to go through the menus and then repeat \u201cblah blah blah\u201d three times for every call.

I have gone back to AT@T.  this absolutely the worst thing I have ever done with my phones. We finally got a chip back and put it in the phone they told us to put it in.  3 weeks later my phone drops dead.  Why, oh the chip went in the wrong phone, straight talk dropped my number and my plan.  And there is nothing they can do to fix it but have me buy ANOTHER plan.  They did credit our account the 1 month for all the issues.  But 1 week later they charged it all over again.  When we called to talk about that we find out there is absolutely no one at straight talk who can refund your money.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "works", "Author": "Noah Crabtree", "ReviewID": "R384KSITCNYYVL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Another way to pay then having to go to wal mart or deal with the straight talk website or the phone :)", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am Happy", "Author": "tavery25", "ReviewID": "R1X1EEO8HOJ9QD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone card.
