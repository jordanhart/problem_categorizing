It is a great phone integrated with all the features that you would like to have. - GPS+WiFi+GSM+Blue tooth. I don't regret buying this phone. I does its job without any problem.  Even with all these features, I feel like this phone is not for me. This would be a great one for business. But I feel it is a bit of a over kill for personal use. I feel the response time is little slow because the processor is bogged down with all the application. You have to wait half a second by the time you press the button before the phone responds  Next is GPS - Even though the software behaves like a full fledged GPS, you cannot have maps worth more than 512 MB. This means that you can have only a few states worth of maps in the memory. If you travel to a different place then the next time you update the maps, the software wipes out all the previous data while generating the new map. Later I figured that we can use some other softwares(like TOM TOM ) to overcome this problem. I have yet to buy it but It seems like It would work.  About the WiFi, I couldn't think of any reason I would use a WiFi when I'm home.(may be at hot spots)I would rather use the computer.  Keyboards - As always (previous models is not big enough to type with comfort)  If you are a Road warrior, this is the one of the best you can get. But I will not recommend it for personal use.UPDATE: Good PDA but bad cell phone - minor but annoying quirkJanuary 26th, 2008Now, it is almost 6 months I have this cell phone. I'm finding that the longer I have it, the less I like it. In my opinion, this seems like a experimental model-an attempt to make a big jump for a truly integrated mobile phone. For the first time I'm disappointed with a HP product. I should say that user interface is very important. It need not be as flashy as Iphone but there should be some level of ease. the small keyboard is becoming increasingly annoying. Heavy windows is truly hurting it. I'm not a person who has a very good knowledge on software but from a user point of view, this is my opinion - You should not wait for the cell to respond. I have missed phone calls many times just because, the phone gets hung up when Im trying to receive the call. Some times I have to reboot it.  One more thing I noticed is when ever you closed the program, it still runs in the background and takes the memory. This makes the phone sluggish. I have to go and delete all of them every now and then. I'm still maintaining the 4 stars for the integration. Not the performance.As a PDA it might get a 4 star but as a cell phone it deserves only 1 star.  I believe that road warriors Deserve better performance and I do think they have it now.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "HP 6940 Phone better", "Author": "Luis J.
