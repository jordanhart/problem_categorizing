I was worried when i first put the order in that the pictures didn't match the description. But this is certainly a Lg optimus 3d max P725. very nice phone . large very responsive multitouch capacitive screen. Not too large tho, fits in my pocket just fine. The 3d is better than i anticipated much better than a nintendo 3ds. The camera is sweet too very crisp pics, its better than my old motorola milestone . 3d video is neat too. I live in the states and had no trouble getting it activated on at&t; network thru straight talk. Going from spotty 3g to pretty steady 4g is a huge plus. I would recommend this phone to anyone that can actually see 3d.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone", "Author": "Mr Unconscious", "ReviewID": "R3FM3EMXZ94TNY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing, i cant describe it well, but is a must buy for 3D fans.
