{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent Phone", "Author": "Elijah32", "ReviewID": "R1B30STCRX6X51", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is pretty good. One plus is that it comes with windows mobile 6.5 rather than the 6.1 mentioned in the descrition box. When I purchased this item I thought I was going to have to upgrage to the 6.5 mobile software myself but that got scratched off my list. Camera works pretty well, but it is only a 2 MegaPixel camera. Video camera is also decent, does not lagg when I move the phone around. Windows office mobile is the same as always you can edit files for Word, Powerpoint, and Excel. Trackball is a little EHH, but some people like the trackball. Keys on the keyboard pop out making it easier to text. Wifi is a little dificult to connect at first but you will get the hang of it. I wish I could change the layout of the start menu but that is not do-able. Windows media player works good. If you do not like the headphones it comes with the box also comes with an adapter only downside of that is its not micro so it is kind of awkward. Windows marketplace has many apps available to download. I have not tested to see if it is truly unlocked but I will update this review when that is tested. Also if you have too many apps open you need to go to your task manager and end the application. If not it will SLOW down your phone because it is just like a PC it has a processor and certain amount of ram. If you just backspace the app it will not exit out and will just minimize. So every now and then check you task manager to make sure you do not have too many apps open and running. Overall it is a pretty decent phone and looks great.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "where's the rest of it????", "Author": "ingrid j.", "ReviewID": "R1K65UXA1H38BL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have just received my order and I was so excited to start using my phone. But much to my dismay and disappointment, the back cover was missing. At first I thought, \"is it supposed to look like this???\" but then again \"surely NOT!!\" Will be returning this product today. I hope to hear from the seller (UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS INC.) soon and that they process my refund without delay. Will update this review depending on how well they respond to my problem...", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "My First HTC Phone", "Author": "Kevin Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2LD0KBCYILAKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to get a new phone after having my Motorola RAZR V8 for over three consecutive years, so I chose to get the HTC Dash 3G.Now keep in mind that this was my FIRST HTC phone, meaning I had no experience with this company's previous phones nor their customer service, but I decided to give them a shot.The phone looks very nice and the QWERTY keyboard was bigger than I expected. I immediately inserted my SIM Card and the battery, closed the back cover, and turned on the phone. Once turned on, I started to explore the phone a bit.The home screen was extremely well done, having separate categories for different things, i.e one category for missed or new calls, text messages, voice mails, and e-mails; another category for Windows Media Player and so on.You can also do all sorts of other neat things with this nice phone, such as set up to two alarms, check how many minutes or messages you have left via My Account, set or look for appointments, etc.The 2.0 megapixel was of no bother to me. This phone's camera was equivalent to my old phone's, except the Dash 3G had fixed focus, whereas my old one did not.I cannot comment on the Web browsing as my family's account only has Talk + Text.Overall, this phone was a satisfying purchase for $99.99 (at the time I bought it.) I would recommended it to anyone who loves to talk and text or is upgrading from a non-QWERTY keyboard phone to a QWERTY-keyboard one.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Too bad about the menu and track ball; they killed a nice phone", "Author": "ajtoophan", "ReviewID": "R2NN50LP20Q6BB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone looks and feels very nice . It has many nice features but they are obstructed by the menu which is non-intuitive and not user friendly(to me anyway)Sending messages with video/audio/text is very easy and convenientCall quality is good, but I had many dropped calls (not sure was it network or the Dash itself.), Using speaker during a phone call, many people told me I sounded \"choppy\" or my voice varied in level; but I heard clear enoughSpeaker sound is a little tinny but not bad.Camera is just a \"dash\" below average-many pics were grainy, depending on lighting; likewise for video capture. Downloaded pics were more crispy, but got grainy with zooming in.Dealing with Windows Media Player is very very frustrating- cannot control files add/delete songs/videos; I could only play/stop/ full screen/ adjust volume-I couldn't access media files from inserted memory card, nor could I transfer them to the library (I am not a high tech guy so may be others will find that easy to handle).I used Wi-Fi (I don't have data plan); connectivity is not bad, but using the track ball is frustrating- movement was not precise; it is difficult to aim and click on something without hunting around it many times.Browsing speed was fast enough to me, but many times  was hit and miss; the Dash will not allow me to type in (or get in) websites names directly; it only allowed search mode for them under Google-search, then I had to go through the search items , then hunt for the click spot, then click and click and wish it will connect!There is no refresh button( or at least I couldn't find it) once in a web page, and if a typo made in the website name there is no way to correct, but to go out and start again.The supplied head phones sounded OK, but  little bulky and wouldn't stay in place.The  head phone  jack is awkward with its \"huge\" supplied adapter-I bought a smaller adapter but it didn't work with non-HTC head phones.When connected to the charger, the phone gets noticeably hot to touch- it is annoying that  it will not tell you how much charge has accumulated, unless unpluggedI tried to get used to the Dash but couldn't and eventually decided to return it. In general I think it is a good phone for many people who can work with its features better than me.I hope this helps.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "good phone.", "Author": "Adrian Velez Salas", "ReviewID": "RCF5NUNSUD0P0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "if you like none touch phones this is a good phone. worth buying NEW. it was for my wife and she kinda liked it.. she had no option either ha.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Refurbished one, trackpoint response was bad", "Author": "Indiana Consumer", "ReviewID": "RO2P8AD9V93JW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought a refurbished one.
