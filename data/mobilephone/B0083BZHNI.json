{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic phone for the price IF you don't use a lot of space!", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R1M8O8CARN4QOI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before this phone I had the Xperia Ray which I loved, but I wanted to try this one so I bought it and I'm really happy with it. The design is great and it's really fast and responsive (It has a dual core processor). I'm a heavy user and so far the only thing that I wish it would be better on this phone is the quality on the videos. It's not bad but they look really pixelated I don't know why but I have a dedicated point and shoot camera which takes great videos and photos so It's not a big deal for me. If you use a lot of space for music and movies you should buy another phone with an SD card slot because this has only 8 gigs (Xperia Ray is in the same price range and has SD card). 4 gigs for the phone and apps and 4gigs for your music, photos, etc. I don't use a lot of space that's why I decided to buy it and so far it's great! Really fast and responsive and once it gets Ice Cream Sandwich it will be better. If you're looking for a budget phone this is THE BEST you will find.BUY IF:-You want to try a great android phone.-You want the best unlocked smartphone for under 300.-You don't need more than 4 gig of space for music and photos.-You want a fast and reliable phone-You want a great phone with front facing and rear camera.DO NOT BUY IF:-You want more than 4 gig of space for music and photos.-You care a lot about high quality videos.PROS:-Great design-Good size-Screen is crisp and bright-Dual core processor-really fast and responsive-Sony keyboard is one of the best I've used. It has swype function.-2 cameras: Front and back-LED flash-GPS-Battery life is great.CONS:-only 8 gigs of space-Low quality videos-Speaker doesn't work with google hangouts I don't know why.EDIT Jul.3.12 :1. I think I was a little harsh as far as video quality goes. It's not that \"low quality\". It's standard but some pixelation and artefacts make it look bad. Search in youtube for \"xperia u video sample\" and you'll see it in action. 2. I have had a problem with Google+ Hangouts where the loud speaker is really, really low. The loudspeaker works great for everything other than Google+ Hangouts so if you want this phone for hangouts I don't recommend it unless the 2 I got where  defective. I guess you could buy it and if it doesn't work you can return it.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice phone", "Author": "Elio Venezuela", "ReviewID": "R3O4P32YJ2W7RR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is awesome... very nice design(good size and lightweight), really fast and responsive (1 Ghz Dual core procesor, 512 Ram), the sound quality is fantastic (Xloud, equalizer), high quality display (Mobil Bravia Engine, 3.5\", capacitive, multi touch), good rear camera (5 Mpx), standard front camera, WiFi, 3G without problem in Venezuela, OS 2.3.7 (Gingerbread)works perfectly, and very good battery..... only 8GB memory (2GB not usable, 2GB for aplications and 4GB for music, videos, pictures, etc...), don't have micro sd slotVeredict: Excellent Android Phone, not expansive (under 260$), SONY quality... it's perfect if you don't need a lot space for storageIt's came witn a white bottom cap, charger, charger adaptor, stereo headset, display protector, manualsSony Xperia U St25i (Black+ 1 Additional Bottom Cap)(5MP): Brand New Unlocked GSM Phone", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "gabrielamfc", "ReviewID": "R18PWWCIIT9PF9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a great great cell phone with a very good price.

I love that power button is on side, I wish screen was a little bigger like the xperia p and speaker is in back, best position for speaker is on side like the xperia p.

I must say out of everything, I was shocked when watching the music videos, the resolution and clarity/brightness was amazing!, Im still in awe when watching, my friend has a phone that costs almost 3 times as much and looks no where near as good in video quality, it really freaked me out, its the best picture Ive ever seen seen! this is not a cheap feeling phone!, it has a good weight and good thickness and feel.

The phone I ordered came brand new, unopened, factory sealed, i'm very satisfied and happy with the product. The Sony phone works very good I had it for almost a week now and I use it for hours and hours every day I have no complaints at all with this Sony phone. I chose Sony because my family and I have a lot of Sony products for generations and we trust the Sony brand for their excellent product quality and design so thats why I got the Sony Xperia U phone. The phone has everything I wanted: has a built in GPS reciver, and on a good day it will lock to the satellites within one minute or so (make sure you enable it under settings for it to work. No internet needed), has a very good camera no complaints it takes very good pictures if you mess around with the exposure levels and set it to max 5MP pictures. At night will have some noise but its not that bad, The sound is very good also, it's loud and clear, the phone's microphone is also very clear i tried it with a sound recorder set on high quality and did a very good job, the small down side to the phone is it has no SD Card slot on it and only has built in Flash memory 8Gb and for the user partion it has only 4GB usable which is not bad for me since I have some songs, pictures and other useful media for me it does me good and have plenty of space, the battery life should last you up-to a day if your surfing the web listing to music and looking at some pictures and video with wifi on only but it may vary.

Thought all purchases of this phone would come with them regardless of the seller. I do prefer the bottom black cap (which I got) but my purchase promised two caps.Would have been 5 stars if the seller had not mention that I would also receive an additional bottom cap.But for what it's worth, great phone so far, classy yet simple, right size for me.

So contacted Sony customer service in good faith and of course got their standard reply to be 'a little patient' !! Another 3 months later, still no update. NEVER NEVER NEVER going to buy another Sony product ever. This is the way they treat their customers after they are done with the sales.
