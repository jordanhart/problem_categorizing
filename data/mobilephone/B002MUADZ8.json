It was a perfect smartphone for someone who never had one. I still think it could be a great smartphone for a first time smartphone user...however with all the upgrades on apps in the play store it makes this phone run slow. However after two years and lots of wear and tear this phone has barley started having issues like resetting,freezing and not responding. I feel though for the price here on Amazon this phone isnt worth it unless its all you can afford or you just want a super basic smartphone. I have to say save yourself the hassel and upgrade to the HTC mytouch ($209 on Amazon). Especally if you plan to have the phone for a few years and avoid this model if you plan to really work this phone with a bunch of apps.Note: This model runs froyo with no upgrade to gingerbread. So if you have this phone,recently purchased or considering it there is an application in the play store called GO Launcher ex (which gives you the option to hide all the unnessary preloaded apps installed on the phone)...it gives this phone an upgraded look and feel...I actually like it more then ice cream sandwhich. It has a bunch of add-ons that are spectacular. Anways I have noticed since I upgraded to this launcher my phone doesnt restart anymore and doesnt freeze as often....just something to think about I guess.", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not 3G over other than TMobile only Edge", "Author": "ComputerGeek", "ReviewID": "R3D1H74U9LVTKT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got this phone (now for a few months now). It came unlock as advertised. There is no Querty keyboard as it said in the instructions but has a 3.5mm audio jack in the top. It is unlock and I'm using on a different network than TMobile. It says TMobile at the top and myTouch 3G when starts. The frequencies supported by the phone makes it work ONLY on EDGE as for other carrier different than TMobile (I have never put in a TMobile sim). So if you plan to use this as a 3G phone for other than TMobile search elsewhere. With time I came to realize there are a few different versions of this phone. The one I got (TMobile myTouch 3G) is only EDGE on the carrier that I'm using (every carrier that is not TMobile or support its 3G frecuencies). The 3G is ONLY ON TMobile. Other than the phone being slow on Edge it has been good to me. Signal/Battery is acceptable not great but I can live with that (will depend on usage). Just recently I installed a custom firmware and it is running good (still on Froyo).As of performance, this is an old hardware phone so no angry birds for you. You may download it but there is no way to use it, it is just too slow. I use this phone as my everyday phone as well as for development.About the package/shipping:All Perfect! IN time, Perfectly clean and No physical problems whatsoever. Just plugged in the battery + my Sim card and work from day one. It came with android 1.6 or 2.1 but the same day I opened it and in minutes auto downloaded the update to Froyo flawless.So overall if you do not want a high end phone and are ok to use ALWAYS EDGE it is recommended. If you want to use 3G on other network than TMobile or want a high end phone look elsewhere.I gave 3 Stars for the EDGE and is may be my bad just to research on the web beforehand. Got confuse with the TMobile 3G thing.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "I am very disappointed with my phone", "Author": "Cordel O.", "ReviewID": "R3UXC90CQ43O60", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I don't like it because it cannot be up grade.

Tse \"mao\"", "ReviewID": "RDM359V3IFSS4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this HTC Magic for use while traveling outside the US, but I couldn't get it to work.  My first suspicion came when I opened the box and found that it was a T-Mobile branded phone.  Well, it was advertised as unlocked, so what could go wrong?When I turned on the phone it took me to an Android screen and asked me to click on the Green Monster to begin.  When I click it tried to connect to some \"server\", hangs for a few minutes, and fails.  I tried different SIM cards for different networks, same result.  I tried a SIM that has internet connectivity, failed again.To make matters worse this phone does not appear to have wi-fi, so there is no other way to connect to Google's server's except through the phone network, which I can only assume is still tied to T-Mobile.  There are many newer phones that offer both wifi and Bluetooth for less money.I returned the phone without ever getting past the welcome screen.

Had a very good design and features. One thing that bothers me very, very, very, very, very, very very much is the suckish speed of the phone. About a 550 hertz processor doesn't sound so bad and it isn't. But that speed is a lie!!! If I were to give an estimate about how fast the phone was, I would have to say 1 hertz processor. No kidding. For example, I go onto an app and when I just press an icon, it says:  Sorry  The acore. processor is not  working right now.That doesn't just happen once. it happens several times and it's very annoying.
