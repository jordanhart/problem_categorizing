If you need a \"smartphone\" with all the apps, toys, and do-dads, then you won't like this phone.  It's kinda heavy and thick, but it has a military-spec rating, and it is solidly weather-sealed.  You can hold a lot of pictures, music, etc., by adding in an inexpensive micro-memory card found nearly everywhere.  I added one that has 4GB extra storage and that has been plenty for me.My only real complaint is that the external display which is the OLED type (organic light-emitting diode) went down to about 1/5th the normal brightness after about a year and a half.  I can't figure out any reason why it would do this because I never did treat the phone harshly or expose it to any unnatural stresses, and unfortunately you cannot adjust the brightness.  Browsing the 'net, I find out that there are many complaints about OLED displays in many different devices.  OLED seems to be another technology that didn't work out so well.The inside display, which is NOT the OLED type (I think it is an LED type), has adjustable brightness and works and looks perfectly.

It does stand up well as far as I'm concerned. One major drawback is the bad sound quality. It is very hard to understand conversations sometimes and I don't think it is because of the reception area. The other huge frustration is that the external display is totally useless unless you're in a very dark area. So, if you're outside in the daytime - forget it - you won't be able to see it. What makes that even more frustrating is that they give you an option to change the display on the internal screen (which seems to be plenty bright) but don't give you any option to increase the brightness on the external screen. The larger internal screen has to take a lot more energy than the small external screen which needs to be brighter. What kind of person decided to design the phone like that ????!!!!

Immediately after getting it, I noticed it was pretty sturdy, having a heavy, durable feel to it. I liked the metal studs fastened to the upper and lower edges of the phone, ostensibly there to prevent wear from sliding in and out my my pocket...unfortunately 1 of these fell right off immediately, and other followed soon after. So I use the term \"fastened\" loosely, since they don't seem to be fastened to anything. A little superglue fixed this, but the thing is, I shouldn't have to superglue parts back on to a phone marketed as \"heavy duty\" right out of the package. I liked how Casio made an honest attempt to make this phone waterproof. The charging port is covered by a solid piece of plastic and sealed with a gasket, as is the the battery cover (which took some muscling to get on, but its that kind of phone so I didn't mind) and the headphone jack. Unfortunately, the cover for the charging port was only attached to 2 strips of flimsy plastic so it snapped off pretty fast. I kept the piece, but its annoying to keep track of a little piece of plastic every time you charge your phone. And you're going to be charging this phone a lot, since the battery life is pretty short for a \"no frills\" basic phone like this. The specific shape of the charger is another issue I had. I've owned Nokia, Samsung, Verizon, LG and most of them all used the same shape charger. That way if you lose or break one, you have a spare, can easily find a replacement at a gas station or borrow one, since its such a common charger. The charger that came with a bluetooth keyboard for a tablet I have even uses the same shape as a common Verizon charger. But no the Casio G'Shocks. Unless you happen to have a spare somewhere, good luck finding a replacement short of ordering one and shelling out more money than is necessary. Not a single store has a charger that fits these phones, except maybe Radio Shack, but come on! I shouldn't have to go to Radio Shack just to replace a phone charger, especially since they are now widely available at any gas station. There is no reason for this oddball design except to fleece you for more money for a new charger.Despite all of the issues I personally ran into, it's great if you are looking for basic workhorse phone. Other people's experiences will vary, but  I don't think there are any other basic phones with a keyboard out there that are as durable as the Brigade.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not as good as my last C741", "Author": "Monkey arm", "ReviewID": "R1IV8HCZH5JX8J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my second C741 and right out of the box it suffers from the same problems reported by other users. When my first c741 phone stopped ringing on incoming calls, my wife started getting annoyed by my not answering. Personally, it didn't bother me at all. lol.You see, it was dropped in the snow in the middle of the road and subsequently run over by several vehicles, then the snow plow came and plowed it into a snow bank where it sat for a week or two. When I went looking for it I found it lying face down in muddy water....and it was ringing! Now that's a tough phone. That was also the last time I ever heard it ring but the phone itself kept on working and still works today.My replacement, however, rings just fine but I have to almost yell to talk to anyone. It seems clear to me that the problems with speakers and the screen fading over time are possible reasons why this model was cancelled by Verizon/casio but I suspect that the unsurpassed durability/longevity of this unit and it's ability to used on basic verizon plans probably killed it. Verizon wants your money! Giving you a phone that lasts forever and works on there lowest package is not conducive to their goal of emptying your wallet. Just take a look at the phones Verizon now offers their lowest package subscribers. There are only 3 and my wife and 3 daughters have broken all of them in short order.

Woolf \"Woolfy\"", "ReviewID": "RSUS2Y9OKQU8P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am the kind of person that was hesitant to get a smart phone because I have a history of breaking phones. Im an outdoor woman so I need a phone that is military status, with a battery that will last more than a day like all smart phones. Im also a minimalist so I can't be paying 60 dollars a month to have a working phone. Im also more of a texter than a talker.After literally 24 hours of research on rugged phones I finally decided on the Casio Brigade.What I needed in a phone ordered in priority:Firstly, I had to find a version phone as much as I hate version. They unfortantely have the best coverage and I will be living primarily in the mountains. So my research was filtered to version rugged phones only.1) Rugged (military grade waterproof, shock proof and dust proof)Although I haven't purposely tried to beat up this phone it feels really solid. The back door is very secure. . I am looking forward to going into the woods, river crossings and rainy days backpacking and not have to worry about my phone getting wet or dust in it. It will be great for Burning Man and other festivals where a phone is likely to get broken as well which is a plus2) Long battery lifeThe battery lasted a whole week with non-stop texting and web use etc!!!!!! Amazing! with an extra battery I will be able to go 2 weeks without charging which is extremely helpful since I will be living in a tent with no electricity for the next year!3) Qwerty keyboardVery easy texting!!! I will admit I have been a text and drive in the past to I originally was trying to find a phone that had voice to text and the only RUGGED phone I found with that feature is the Casio Ravine but like most smart phone the battery was s*** compared to the Brigade and definitely dose not seem as rugged. What the Brigade dose have is voice text and video text, and is very responsive to voice commands. There is nothing more frustrating than telling your phone to \"call mom\" and it calls Brenda instead (you get the idea). I love the text to speech feature too so I can hear a text when I am driving (less looking down and much safer all around).4) size and lookCompared to some popular smart phones this is not really that bulky and is some cases smaller than your average smart phone. won't be able to fit it in your skinny genes but I'm usually in outdoor cloths anyway and throwing in your purse or back is perfectly fine because the thing won't get smashed and no screen to worry about breaking.SO WHY ONLY 4 STARS?1) its an older phone so there are some disadvantages. You have to get the specific battery chargers for it. and there are mild glitches that other reviewers have mentioned such as the phone truing off by itself sometimes and the screen will just go blank randomly occasionally. Its more on an annoyance and so far is not a problem at all.2) When I received the phone i the mail the back door of the phone was completely broken. the tiny pieces that connect the back door to the phone was clearly and horribly glued on so when I assembled the phone the pieces broke off completely and the back was not secure leaving the back completely exposed. However, I contacted the seller and they were very quick to get back to me. They even made it hassle free by sending a new back door for free and I wouldn't have to return anything.

The thing never shut off. I now have an iPhone 4S but I also have this phone in the closet and it still works! I'm not a huge fan of the iPhone and I am soon upgrading to the Casio Commando on 4G LTE. I am hoping it is as extremely well made as the brigade.

Wilson \"Derik\"", "ReviewID": "R1U8A0JDLY7TPX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the phone in about 2 days.  It looks new and in good shape.  It came with a charger (unfortunately it's a proprietary USB port, or so it appears), and a battery.  The battery was dead on arrival and I am charging it right now.  It's been charging for half an hour and still the battery is dead, so I will wait a few hours and see what happens.  Any other phone I have received had a fully charged batter, so this was disappointing.  The screen on the front is very small, and not real useful except to see who a message came from, to view the time, and to see contact list when you are calling out.  I can't test the push-to-talk because I don't have the service and no one to test it with.  The keyboard is very nice, and the reason that I bought this phone.  The inside screen is plenty big and looks good.  The phone comes with very useful apps like the VZ Navigator, which is free with a data plan (no the phone does not require a data plan, but after you activate it you have to call Verizon and ask them to block data and take the plan off your bill).The battery cover is very flimsy and I cracked it trying to pry it open to put in the battery.  It didn't crack at the sealed area, so no harm done to the watertight seal.  The directions on the web site says to unlock the back cover, then place your finger in the recessed area on the upper left edge of the cover.  There is no recessed area on the upper left or any other edge except some too small for a finger or finger nail.  I had to use a very small flat head screwdriver and it also damaged the cover because the material is a soft cheap plastic.  They claim that this phone can take a beating, but I don't see the back cover or the front screen glass surviving much of a beating at all.I tested the voice out by calling my skype number and leaving a voice message.  It sounded clear but very mono (as do most phones).  The ring tone has always been very choppy with verizon which always makes me nervous about the talk and listen quality of any phone, but the ear speaker was very clear on this one.I will update this review about the battery later once it is charged, but so far I like the phone a lot! [Battery Update]:  Battery gooood!  Took only about 2 hours or so to charge.  Full use so far for about 2 hours without a drop in battery bars.
