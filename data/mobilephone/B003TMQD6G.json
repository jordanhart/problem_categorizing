The touch screen is a little stiff if you compare it to an Ipod touch so if you like a sensitive touch screen this phone is probably not for you. However if you are like me and tend to stuff the phone in your pocket the stiffer screen is actually nice. I like the keyboard and the shortcut keys at the bottom of the screen. The Camera is great. i have an Ipod touch and I don't use the MP3 player so I can't comment on that. However the phone has good ring volume and sound quality. I have also dropped the phone several times and the phone wasn't damaged the back didn't even pop off. The battery can go about 3 days without being charged. I would recommend this phone for someone who wants a phone with a few extras.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "This phone is the cause 75% of my world's frustration", "Author": "Michael Welton", "ReviewID": "R3BF49NOKR7XTH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for about a year and a half.  I have cursed it at least once every day of that time.  First and foremost, the touch screen is awful.  Most of the time it does not recognize a simple touch or selection and if you try to scroll, it either does not feel the touch or it buzzes through the whole list.  Possibly the second most frustrating aspect, also related to the touch screen, is that when I talk I either hit hold, mute, or speaker phone with my cheek.  I have tried to avoid it and consciously hold the phone away from my ear, but I still seem to hit those buttons.  Another issues, is if you need to call someone who is not programed to a number, you need to hit about 7 buttons to retrieve their number to call.  I might as well just dial their number.  This frustration is exacerbated by the touchy touch screen.  Though there are a myriad of other frustrations, I will finish with just one more.  The alarm is a nightmare.  Some designer thought it would be useful to allow the user to program a limitless amount of wake up alarms, each with a seemingly limitless amount of options within that alarm.  For each alarm you chose time (of course), days, snooze on-off, snooze duration, snooze repetition.  The last few options are the concern, because if I accidently program alarm number 5 to wake up instead of alarm 2, if I don't confirm the snooze settings I may hit snooze in the morning and it not function, function for 1 min and only come on once more, or possibly wake me up 15 minutes later.In conclusion, I hate this phone.  I hate the makers of this phone.  I hate the designers of this phone.I only use the phone for call and text.  I can't imagine it is worth a darn with e-mail or internet.  Though sometimes I accidently hit the app button to load the internet and then it takes about a minute to return.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung T669", "Author": "Dean E", "ReviewID": "R1ILQX4KAH1JUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone, Its very user friendly and I dont feel overwhelmed by it.

TMobile & Samsung should be ashamed for sticking people with this crappy phone.If you want to find out for yourself - simply Google Samsung Gravity Smart internal memory errors & you'll see the sea of complaints about about this phone's ridiculously low internal memory.I bought this Samsung Gravity Smart phone in November 2011 primarily because of the Wi-Fi calling, large screen & QWERTY keyboard thinking I really only needed to be able to make calls when I'm at home & my crappy TMobile reception fades out. This phone has a shamefully non-existent 150 Megabytes of internal memory compared to most phones that have at least 4 gigabytes.So what does that mean for you?;it means that you'll never be able to install ANY APP what so ever. It also means that you won't be able to receive any text messages because the memory will always be too low to allow the phone to receive messages. You'll be able to send them, but you'll daily have to delete every text message.Trust me even if you're thinking that's okay, I'll only be using this phone for just this or that, I don't need a bunch of apps or games - it won't be okay... it won't :( You will be frustrated.Even though it has virtually non-existent internal memory, T-Mobile & Samsung still chose to ship it preinstalled with 100 Mb of junk software that further helps to make the problem worst.Please save yourself the inevitable headache that is sure to come & buy a different phone.Also when you call T-Mobile to complain about the phone not functioning properly, you'll literally get a rep that tells you to check to see if apps are installed on the SD card. Well most apps aren't written to be installed on SD so that suggestion sucks. Also, even though an app may be saved to SD, the data it generates while you're using it goes in the internal memory. So guess what, you're still suck!If you look on Samsung's site for internal memory problems, well here's how severe it is. They answer every other question about this phone online... YOU HAVE TO CALL THEM TO GET INTERNAL MEMORY ISSUES ADDRESSED!That's how bad this phone is, they don't even want to answer the questions in a public forum. They throw rocks & then hide their hands! They're ashamed of even making this phone with this ridiculously low functionality.If you only want a pretty phone that you can only make calls on, then this is the phone for you. It has pretty colors, nice screen, the keyboard isn't that good - it doesn't have arrow keys & a lot of the symbols take forever to get to like $.Again to sum it up 150Mb of internal memory is a horrible thing for anyone, even a teen of housewife to deal with. And I got the phone free & I still paid too much for it. With an extended 2 year T-Mobile contract (which they messed up the billing & charged me 3 times what I should've been paying - TMobile you all have to get it together - please) & it still isn't worth what I paid for it.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "gravity touch", "Author": "leany", "ReviewID": "R28Q1ZYYVNA95V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is awesome i purchased it for my daughter who simply just loves it!

Despite not being cheap ($100-160 online), the phone has various cheap-feeling features that really degrade the user experience. The main two noticeable ones are the laggy, consistently uncalibrated touchscreen and the very cheap feeling and too-short power cord (what would 3 more feet of cord cost, $1.50?). The screen is slow to advance regularly and will get stuck between menus, and if there is any amount of moisture at all (not talking rain here) it will not work. For example, the phone was in my pocket for a few minutes, where many people keep their phones. I took it out, and tried to click an on-screen menu. It scrolled instead.I had problems with it after only a few months. I previously had a Sidekick for 3 years(!) which was the best phone I ever owned. Not too many bells and whistles, but the interface was blazing fast, the battery life was superb, and the texting menu was a 10/10, perfect.

In order to set a speed dial (basic convenience of a cell phone), I have to find a manual. And there's no way to play music by folders. If your mp3 tracks don't have tag info, as those I converted from CDs several years ago, you'll have to scroll the screen and pick out the songs and put them in a playlist in order to play.3) Lousy touch screen.

I have been through 2 of them after returning the first for warranty replacement (surely this phone has to be defective, right?)  My husband had one (but quickly sold his for BB) and a close friend got stuck with one, but again quickly sold his and got a BB. All of us agree this phone was Samsung's greatest fail.Right out of the box it's a \"pretty\" phone, if that's all you care about.  It's clean nice lines, slider keyboard, and long battery life are about all the pros I can think of at this moment. The battery will last days and days.That being said, the touch screen is completely worthless.  It is EXTREMELY slow to respond to scrolling, sometimes not scrolling at all and other times jumping back to start point. Often when you open an app, or tap to check texts it will do it's own thing.  Sometimes it will start the (VERY SLOW) web browser without prompt or open an app you didn't select. Other times the app or icon wont respond at all to your tap.lTexting application is mediocre. The biggest downfall in this area is sometimes when you try to add your contact for sending to, the screen just jumps and won't let you scroll or select anyone.The most frustrating part to this phone is it often won't hang up a call.  It doesn't matter how many time you press the end call button, it will not hang up.  You can slide open, close, try again, tap multiple times... no response.  I have had a call on for almost a minute after ending the conversation and still can't get the call to hang up.  Might as well take the battery out at that point! Getting off the back of this phone to access the battery is ridiculous, but doesn't contribute to the functionality (or lack of it) so I won't address it.To Samsung's credit, I have dropped the phone a lot recently (because I no longer care, shopping for new one) and it still 'works'... if that's what you call it.

I will write it with bullet points so you don't feel as if you're reading a book, but secretly you will indeed get a short book.-Since a lot of the menus and buttons to use this phone are on the touch screen the whole touch screen goes bananas if I spill one tiny droplet of water on it. I mean, sink spray, rain, pocket sweat, you name it. You now can no longer unlock the phone from the screen, hitting any button has no response or it does a different function completely (ex: sliding the screen)-If the text message inbox fills up then this phone tells me this - as in it wants me to delete some a.s.a.p. - before I continue doing anything. So it pops up an alert letting me know. If I ignore it then it pops up again and again every minute. So when I'm trying to delete said messages it reminds me again in the middle of choosing which messages to keep or delete, interrupting me and not only making me check a box next to a message I wanted to keep, but also clearing my checked boxes up to that point.-The touch screen is the most unreliable part of this touch screen phone. It doesn't respond like an iPhone, or barely responds correctly at all. *Unlock *Unlock, \"Oh! That's right! I gotta get the right angle and hold it!\" *Unlock. \"Oops! I lost it!\" *Unlock *Unlock *Unlock *Open. Finally.-When I want to hit the button to check my text messages the \"web\" button gets in the way. Which is annoying not only to people without an internet plan, but people who WANT TO CHECK THEIR MESSAGES!-This phone doesn't have a very good camera, it's only 2 megapixels and it can't even zoom in if I'm on the \"best\" quality.-Deleting pictures is annoying as ever if I try to delete one by one. I hit the picture itself to get the options bar, and for some reason it goes away. Hit for the bar, goes away, bar, *stays* scroll to the delete option and again it goes away. I repeat this process over and over and finally I kill myself- I mean I get lucky enough that it is locked on screen because of the \"sure you want to delete?\" notification popping up.-The creators made the photos slide on their own for some reason - on their own. As in, \"Oh this is a nice photo!\" then it slides over five photos showing possibly private or bad pics. So it's like really? Who put that feature in and why? Why did they make it so I can't turn it off?  It's annoying, even trying to send or delete one and it slides away and goes and goes until I'm 100 pics away and have to back all the way out restarting at the menu.-In the pictures' menu option there is a button called \"Send to My Album\" which gets in the way all the time, since some designer put it at the top. This then sends a photo I didn't intend to be sent to some online album that I never signed up for or am ever going to use.-The rubber case I can buy to \"protect\" this phone comes in two pieces but I only use the back part instead of both sides. Mostly because with the top half on, the top row of keys are covered so I can't text. Grrrrreat design -phone and cover. Also said top part doesn't even have a screen cover (scratches) making the whole thing just for drop damage I guess.-Also another bad thing on the rubber case is that the little tabs that keep it snapped to your phone wear out letting in dirt, making it fall off all the time.-The menus aren't big enough to be able to control; the \"floating\" buttons/apps on screen don't stay where I want them and are hard to place and move them anyways.-After powering it up and finally showing the regular home screen I shouldn't have to then wait even longer to look at MY messages. They're already on my phone, I've seen them before. It shouldn't have to connect to the service to show me things that should be there right then.- Another annoyance, as usual, it forbids me to delete the pre-stored ringtones, wallpapers, and games/apps that have either are dumb that will never be used, or are just trials that want to pay for them. It would save a lot of space getting rid of this garbage.-Speaking of hitting things many times before getting a good response, I have to use the exact pressure, have the exact angle and hit the screen at the exact place 100 times before the alert \"picture delivered\" goes away. This by far is one of the most annoying problems.-In the calls menu when I choose to delete all phone calls but one (an important one or two) it always deletes just that one and leaves the rest. This is usually the point where I punt my phone off of a highway overpass.-When trying to send a message to ten people (the max amount) it forgets its own count, and stops check marking before I reach 10 recipients and telling me that it cannot add anymore. Then back and the ready to send menu it gets confused and has some of the names I chose twice and some not even there.Now in its old age, either 2 or 3 years old, it wasn't turning off after locking - wasting battery.  Then recently it locks and unlocks repeatedly, making me have to rip out the battery to reset it to even use it.

This happens the most when I am using the 3G network.  Why?  I have no idea, your phone does not use 3G or wireless internet to send a message but this phone will not work at least once every time I leave the wireless network and since that happens everyday in between work, commute, home, the store, life, etc... it is very frustrating and not worth the money I pay every month.I can't change my contract without being penalized, I can't upgrade the phone without being penalized, I can't cancel the contract without being penalized.This phone also freezes up and you have to do a hard turn off because it will simply stop working on a screen, it also turns itself on/off randomly.When my kids get home from school I have to call them myself because I can't rely on the texts getting through to me as evidenced by the many texts my husband sends me that I do not receive. So my children's safety could be in danger and if I get busy and can't call I would not know it.This is a terrible phone and TMobile has the worst plans and customer support.

It has many of the features of my old phone that I adored; sturdiness, good camera, user friendliness, etc... I also received some pretty sweet bonuses that my old phone didn't have like voice recognition that I could speak normally to while still being understood perfectly and way faster web browsing. Plus once I start typing someones name or number to call them the phone fills in the rest for me. Once I'm calling that person, the screen turns off once it's close to my face but lights back up if I take it away from my ear giving me access to some pretty cool buttons (speaker mute headset dialpad and add call) that can even make it so I can put someone on speaker and then text someone else or browse the web or send an email. I have also neglected to mention the coolest feature, the one that allows me to use my phone as a mobile hot spot without downloading anything or tampering with it, it came with it out of the box.
