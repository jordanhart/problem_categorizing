I have no complains except for the battery, the battery last half a day doing regular music playing and web surfing.and becareful amazon people! there are three models for the phone make sure you research first and most importantly contact the seller before making a purchase! the three models are LT28i, LT28AT, and LT28H, all of them are called Xperia Ion but they work on different bands meaning certain models work on particular networks. some models may work on AT&T; but not on T-mobile or other GSM networks.Also some sellers list the phones they are selling as LT28i, or LT28H where in fact they are selling LT28AT (AT&T; phone) and there are several customers that received an AT&T; phone instead of the factory unlocked international version.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "very satisfied", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R16Z9ESSJVZ3CW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome phone despite the no 4G LTE.Love everything about the phone.
