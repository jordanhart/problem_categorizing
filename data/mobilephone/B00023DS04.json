At first I thought I was seeing things, because a feature-equivalent Verizon Wireless phone would sell for easily one hundred more dollars. Well, after the initial shock, I did some research on this little phone, and after purchasing it, verified some things...Incredible battery life (advertised as 3.5 hours talk time, 12 DAYS standby); although I haven't tested these numbers, I've had this puppy on for a long time and have yet to go under two out of three bars of battery life!Compact and lightweight...It's a LITTLE smaller than most phones I've encountered, yet the buttons are not too close together at all for someone with big fingers, nor is the screen too small for people who cannot see well.Nice looking to boot! Definitely the nicest looking phone I've seen in a while (only one that maybe compares is the LG VX6000). It's sleek, and the blue looks really sharp both up close and far away.Now onto the best parts...The features!Ready link...Not that I use it, but it's great to have such a thing included if I ever decide to go ready link.Speakerphone! One of the nicest features about the phone, the speakerphone is VERY loud compared to other phones I have used, and as far as I've been told, I sound pretty decent from my end.Camera...Has a flash, zoom capabilities, the ability to send picture mail, link a photo to a caller ID (so you see the photo when a particular person calls), etc etc. It's got all the camera features you'll ever need!Quality of sound...I don't know what other reviewers are talking about, because whether I'm using my plantronics headset, using the speakerphone, or just talking normally, everyone sounds crystal clear! Very rarely will you get some distortion in the way the person sounds, but that may just be a result of the service and not the phone itself. In fact, I would say that is likely.Key layout...I couldn't rate this high enough! The speakerphone has a dedicated key, as does the camera. The buttons are all spaced out nicely and are big enough for those with big fingers. In terms of layout, this baby trumps all of the verizon phones I've ever used.Menu layout...Superb! Everything is easy to get to, and the most commonly used menu items (settings, downloads, messaging, and contacts) have one button shortcuts built into the phone! The menu itself is really nicely put together, with every setting put in the logical place (unlike many phones i've used, unfortunately).What complaints do I have about the phone?Sometimes the button on the side that's used to answer the phone is a little annoying. Why? Because if you just press it quickly, it'll mute the ring (which is a nice feature). But if you press it quickly, because you're not used to it yet, you'll be sitting there struggling to answer the phone. It's just something that needs some getting used to.I guess the only other thing I could possibly be disappointed about is that you can't have the date and your personalized 10ish-character greeting display on top of your custom background. You'll still see the time, battery life, service, etc, but not those two things. Why????? It should at least be an option to turn on/off.So..to summarize...It's the nicest/most reliable/most fun phone i've owned, scoring high in every category. Battery life A+, features A+, layout A+, aesthetics A+, sound quality A (would be a + if I could verify the distortion I SOMETIMES experience is a result of sprint, not the phone).Oh and one last thing: Unlike most phones you'll buy today, this one doesn't actually seem fragile; it has a very durable feel to it.To be cliched, go get this phone now!", "Date": "July 17, 2004"}, {"Title": "I really like my cell phone.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R381UH4UZIP2IP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't have the kind of money where I can buy a new phone whenever I get tired of my old one. I'm a college student and need a phone that is reliable and can be on all day. I actually paid less than expected for this phone after all of the rebates!The main reason that I got this phone was because everyone else had a Sanyo 8200. It was really the word of mouth and seeing the features demonstrated that made me get the phone.I'm very happy with my phone. I can have it on all day and use it when I need to. I'm home before the battery even tells me that it needs to be charged.The external color display is nice to have. I like having it over the LCD that my old cell had.I have more trouble with silencing this phone, though. When the display says that the sound for the ringer was off, the sound for the messages was still on. This can be annoying when you're in class. I found out that I needed to take the volume down one more notch to \"Silence All\" and the problem was solved.The signal for this phone is a lot stronger than previous cell phones that I've had. I still go into roaming on occasion, but I don't have the trouble with dropped called or the phone mysteriously shutting off.Another thing that I really liked about this phone, was that I am able to use the accessories that I had for my Samsung A500. I didn't have to go buy a new car charger or hands-free device. (Though this phone does have a speaker phone option, there are sometimes that the hands-free device is just better.)The camera is decent quality. I was able to take some pictures of a friend's wedding that I was able to share with her family and friends the next day. I also can take lots of pictures, upload them, then take more pictures. On high resolution, my phone holds about 20-25 pictures.Perhaps the best feature in terms of the construction of this cell phone is that the plastic is blue all the way through. If the outside of the phone gets scratched, you won't have a cream colors line. (This was a problem with a Samsung phone that I had. It had been scratched after 2 years of use, and the silver paint was coming off. I had flat gray plastic on the edges of my phone.)I went to an electronics store, and the wanted about thirty bucks more for the red or blue phones. However, if you get the phone from Amazon, there isn't a different in what you pay based on color!One improvement that I wish Sanyo would make is to have colorful hard plastic cases (kind of like the ones Nokie offered for the Nokia 5100 series phones).

The speaker on the outside is loud. I can actually hear this phone ringing as opposed to many other flip phones. The color LCD on the outside is just one of those extra things that you don't need, but is really awesome to see who is calling. The screen quality (for both screens) is amazing. Very sharp colors. The phone doesn't flip open and closed easily, it clicks... and that's good because it's not always falling open all the time and I'm not worried about it breaking the hinge.My only quarrels with the phone are that it is sort of confusing at first to navigate around and figure out all the settings (since there are so many) and you are not able to change the default soft keys for the main screen.", "Date": "November 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "Problem with the network and not the phone...", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "ROOP11VHATP2E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got a hold of this phone about a month ago and have to say that I am pleased overall.  It is my 4th Sprint phone, and is my second favorite- a big boost over the old Sanyo 4500, but not quite the great reception of the Samsung 8500 (1st generaion Sprint phone).  I have found that the reception is the problem of Sprint's network, and not the phone itself, so I cannot throw any fault at Sanyo.Beyond the reception, the phone is stacked with features.  The camera is a nice one, and I like to take pictures of places I am at and share them with people not with me before I erase them.  The quality is not of a digital camera, but for someone just using them for kicks like I do, its alright.  The zoom on the camera is a little tricky, but another nice touch, as is the flash and the frames you can put around the pics.Another great feature is the speaker phone- it is way clearer than landline speakerphones that I have used, and is a great alternative to a clumsy headset.Also, the screens are tight, with brilliant color and clear resolution.  Still, what happened to some free screen savers and games.  Even the games on here are trials - you get interrupted in the middle with a clever reminder that the game must be purchased using Sprint online.  I am surprised sometimes that you dont have to pay a fee to just open the phone sometimes.Another problem with the phone is the lack of accessories, partly due to its newness- I blew 30 beans on a Sprint leather case, but it can't hold a torch to the Bodyglove Ion or Cellsuit cases.  Still with time this I am sure will be fixed.I got the phone with a lot of rebates and think the cost/benefit is phenomenal.  Still, I dont know about the 280 price tag.

It was a cute little phone that was the second cell phone from any U.S. carrier that could take pictures.  (The first-ever model was the SCP-5300 also from Sanyo, released in July 2002.)  The PM-8200 addressed two shortcoming of the 8100: 1) camera quality, and 2) speakerphone.The 8200 sports a higher-resolution built-in camera.  Picture quality is also improved.  The old 8100's pictures often had streaks and distorted colors.  The 8200's pictures look much better.  The speakerphone is definitely a great addition for those of us who like to multi-task yet dislike headsets.  The volume and clarity could be a little better, but given the compact size of this phone, it's not bad.Reception on the 8200 is great, thanks to its external antenna.  Battery life is good, unless you save a lot of things in memory, which depletes battery faster the more stuff it holds.  The phone is attractive and can be customized in many ways, not to mention it comes in three colors.  To Sanyo, I suggest you use the iPod Mini color scheme, because not many people like big red!In summary, the 8200 delivers lots of improvements over the already-excellent 8100.

Can you believe the phone even comes in three different colors to match your own style?  The blue was a great choice for someone like me that drops his or her phone frequently.  The phone has an awesome picture quality due to the built in flash.  This allows the pictures to come out nice and clear.  The menu is really neat with the large letters that makes it easy to see and cool pictures to make it fun.  The text message has been a great improvement from the 8100 because now you do not have to log onto the net, you can just send.  When listening with the flip open or close, the sound is great.

Barker", "ReviewID": "R3UOUE1SUTJOOW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased a new Sanyo PM 8200 in 10/04.  I loved the phone at first.  Then about 3-4 months later (January or February) I noticed the part where my phone flipped open was cracking.  I immediately took it to the store to see if my warranty would cover this crack.  The CSR said it would and they'd tried to fix it.  I left my phone for 45 minutes.  Upon return I was told that since there was a TINY crack near the antenna on my phone, that my warranty was void.  It took me refocusing my eyes numerous times just to be able to see what they were referring to. So I left with no resolution. And very discouraged and upset.In May '05 my phone stopped charging.  Again, I went to Sprint hoping that maybe this time they would value my years as a customer and help me out.  Again, I was cast away with NO resolution.  The CSR said she wasn't familiar with my problem,(even though I researched the problem on many websites and there were many users who had experienced this) but she'd have a tech look at my phone.  After 45 minutes, they said nothing was wrong with my phone, even after I asked them to plug it into a charger and they themselves saw it wasn't charging. The CSR suggested a new battery. So I purchased a new battery, thinking that MAYBE my 7 month old battery had died.  I was LIVID!  I was even more upset when that didn't solve the problem. I went back to the store a few days later to return the $60 battery and to see if maybe someone ELSE would be a little more helpful and he was.  His name was Clinton and he replaced my old phone charger with the bar charger.  He said that would solve the problem and it did, but only temporarily.  As of  July, my phone won't charge AT ALL.  I have to prop it certain ways to trick it to charge, but even after an hour and a half, and it says its fully charged, it IS NOT and when I try to use it, it dies immediately.  Now I have no use of my phone because it won't hold a charge.  Will ANYONE at Sprint PCS help me?  I have always taken my phone in when the problems were in their infancy.

Unfortunately, after acquiring a few other units I have come to the conclusion that many critics have been correct.  While I still think this is a decent phone, it appears to have been plagued with inconsistent manufacturing standards, slightly cheaper components, and higher failure rates than other Sanyo models.The Sanyo 8200 is a solid phone that will be far superior to many alternatives. Not to mention, with the deals you get for signing a 2 year agreement, this phone can be a great value. Sanyo added a few extra nice features for this phone like an alarm (yippie!!!) and appointment calendar. But overall, the features are only slightly above average compared with the current generation of phones. Let's face it, some of these newer phones have really raised our expectations.The phone camera is not top-end but decent for daytime use. Of course the speakerphone quality is high quality as usual with Sanyo phones.The signal strength isn't as good as the 4900 or the 8300.  I suspect they cut corners on the antenna. If you are a person that demands 5 bars in every location, get the 8300 instead. In addition, the MM7500 and the 9000 will probably both offer stronger antennae with their superior next gen features.  While the reception sounds fine, this phone averages 2-3 bars.The screen resolution is also good but not fantastic. The memo recorder could have used much more memory.Sprint coverage is better than advertised as long as you use a good phone. Customer service is not as great as it used to be, but it's still better than Verizon.  I'm switching friends off of Verizon to Sprint. Believe me, if you have bad reception, you have a bad phone and it's time to use that warrantee. With this phone, I've had to go back to the Sprint store countless times to get them to swap it out.Several reviewers have stated they have problems with sounding garbled during conversations. Most likely, this is another case where you need to utilize that warranty or return policy. When the phone is good, it's good. If you're having problems, you probably have one of the 30% of these phones that comes off the manufacturing line with hardware issues. They might not give you another model, but they definitely have to replace the phone.Also, be mindful of the firmware version of this phone.  Even replacement versions are shipping at rev 25.  You should go to the store to update your phone to rev 29 or better.One thing that is a big disappointment is the lack of accessories that come standard with this phone. Not to mention, when are manufacturers going to make a data cable standard?Unfortunately these criticisms apply to all phones. Sanyo has added some nice features to this model. Even with its flaws, it's a decent deal for the price. If you can afford the next generation, however, I would recommend it.

It is odd that they merged with Nextel, because they are my second favorite.Sprint's native network reaches over 250 Million POP. That, with the roaming, their network reaches 290(Digital only phones) or 295(Digital and analog phones) people. that makes it the largest Wireless network in the USA.You get to roam on Verizon's, ALLTEL's, ect networks for free as well.Sprint only offers Unlimited data plans. They offer them for both their Visions and Power Visions access. Prices range from $10 to $25. $25 being the Unlimited Power Visions (EV-DO) access with all of the Sprint TV channels and some Sirius satellite radio, along with other streaming radio channels. Other content can be added, but you would need to check the list. They are always adding new things.Sprint is the only carrier that will let you use your Smart-Device like a Treo 650 with the unlimited Handset data plans. So with Sprint you can use the Unlimited Data on your Treo 650 for $10 a month. Both Verizon and Cingular charge $45 a month for this. T-Mobile $20.They also allow their customers to use their phones as modems, with moderate use. Other carriers either do not have this feature, or have it shut off.Sprint has also added Free Incoming plans to their Fair & Flexible plans. These are plans that keep adding new minutes to your plan, as you go over your bucket.this keeps you from paying 45 to 60 cents a minute in overages. Also keep in mind that other carriers charge roaming and long distance fee's on top of the overage fees. So you can be paying into the $2 dollar a minute range for going over your plan minutes. T-Mobile USA is notorious for this. You pay a fee for the overage minutes, a fee for the long distance, and a fee if roaming. T-Mobile USA's network is pretty small, so you could roaming easily.Another thought to throw around. Is Sprint uses 1900MHz signals for their CDMA/EV-DO coverage. They are also building out their 800MHz coverage with the licenses acquired from Nextel. Since 1900MHz needs more towers to cover a given area, this allows your phone to have more tower choices to choose from.This also increases Internet speeds, because speeds drop with distance.So I have found Sprint's data speeds to be faster then Verizon's. And Much faster then Cingular's and T-Mobile's Internet speeds.Sprint also uses Lockline for their replacement insurance provider. They cover Any phone on your account, purchased from Anywhere, no matter if it is New or Used. Other carriers insurance providers only cover new phones purchased from the carrier.I could go on and on, but just take this into consideration before choosing another carrier just based on a commercial. Or the bucket of minutes they \"Claim\" they are going to provide you. Minutes don't mean a thing if the network is not dependable and the calls sound like crap.Also keep in mind that Sprint uses CDMA, which is the same network technology Verizon uses. CDMA is the most efficient network technology.(...)", "Date": "December 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "charging problems with Sanyo 8200", "Author": "L.

Although store testing finds the product to be within the appropriate testing range, this does not mean that there is not a problem.2) Adjustability of the receiver volume. After repeated testing at all levels, either cannot hear everything being said or voice echoing occurs or voice distortion at higher levels.3) Receiver feature and camera feature share same space.  When switching from left ear to right ear, it is difficult to find a position to hear from.  Have to move the phone almost below the earlobe to get reception.I found this to be true with at least 6 other phone users.The Sprint Store does not take these problems seriously enough to replace the phone for a different model.", "Date": "July 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Well done Sanyo", "Author": "TM77 \"TM77\"", "ReviewID": "R27FKOC3FBMAIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a PM8200 back in October 2004.

The screen is big and bright, unlike the new i730's tiny screen. The camera is easy and fun to use, and with the color display on the outside of the phone you can even take pictures of yourself if you are that vain.

However, after having the phone for about 3 months I knew this one was a \"bad apple\". The voice distortion is so acute that I am often embarrassed by how often I have to ask people to repeat themselves.  If you use your phone for business calls, like I do, look elsewhere unless you want to constantly ask your customers to repeat themselves.  Just recently I have been facing the battery charging issue mentioned by several of the other reviewers.  I am disappointed that this product does not live up to the service I received from my previous Sanyo's.  I will say that the other features of the phone have been okay, but overall I would not recommend this phone.

Patel \"online buyer\"", "ReviewID": "RXH1YYFEW80IG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about a year ago and would recommend it with a few reservations.  Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros:1) It has a very good camera which gives good picture quality.  I have used it to take pictures of everything from outdoor pictures of the sea to indoor pieces of furniture I am thinking of buying and it always focuses and lights well.2) The speakerphone is very useful - I didn't really think I would use it and it wasn't a feature I looked for in a phone, but I have used it so often, I can't do without it now.3) Reception is very good.  I often get reception when other sprint users don't and it is clear and strong.Cons:1) My biggest complaint with this phone is that it is not terribly durable.  I have had to replace it 3 times in 1 year because the hinges always break (from just regular opening and closing) and it eventually looses it's connection to determine when the phone is opened and closed (which means the phone will drain itself of battery and will answer if you touch it when it rings without giving you a chance to screen the call.  If you do buy this phone, definitely sign up for the maintenance plan (which is about $3-$4 a month through Sprint).2) Although it is not big or bulky, it is not one of the most compact out there.  I have seen several smaller, thinner phones and must admit to feeling a bit of cell phone envy when this happens.Overall I think this is a good phone for the money with quite a few features, but the need to constantly replace it is making me look elsewhere.", "Date": "October 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2AXHA5KLWLSKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first this was my dads phone till he got the treo650How got this phone is my old one was stoling I had a vi2300 it was okeyBut den I got this phone and I dient even miss my old one and the call r perfect speaker and normalI have camara so I can see my friends picheres when they call and I have over 1200 ringtones and I use one 4 each friendGET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "Going on 5th bad phone in 5 months...", "Author": "R.

(the head set to plug in the jack and speak hands free, and i have a few plantronic headsets that work great, the big ones.)Store would not give me a blue one, only silver. 2 months later the head set wouldn't work anymore.Given the run around at the sprint stores and tech and made to drive over 500 miles going back and forth (in 35 mile increments).Given 3rd phone, got to my car and started to make a call, head set wouldn't work right out of the box. That's less than 90 seconds after leaving the store.Given 4th phone the same day (not working this same day, 2 bad phones in the same day) and would keep beeping, the icon for battery would blink from full charge to BEING recharged (not in need of, but being), while half muting the person on the other end of the phone call.After 4 hours in the store this day, even though they saw it was not working, refused to replace because their tech guy went home and he was required to say it's broken before they change it out.My previous phone was the sanyo 4900 which i had to replace in the first week, but has lasted for the last 2 years, very dim screen and big, but worked great.The 8200?, I got it free and it's cost me so much money in time and gas and trouble, feels like It's cost me $1000. By far the worst quality phone I have dealt with in the last ten years.emailed sprint and they have agree to allow me to take any of their phones and they will credit the 229 list price.Did not offer to compensate for all the BS their store reps have put me through. Worst people in the world at the sprint store in Asheville, NC... patton ave. Hendersonville road and mall is where you should buy if your in this town.I've liked sanyo alot, but now I'm almost scared off of them. My old samsung wasn't as strong in reception and battery life, but I'm using cnet to investigate phones that have the same problem with everybody.I do have a few friends that have not had AS MANY problems as I have had and they are hard on phones, my 4900 still looks new. I'm very easy on my phones.If I had not gotten 4 bad phones....just rating the phone on the features and the like, I'd probably rate it 3 stars at best.The phone is average, imo. The worst thing about the phone, from all the phones, is to listen to a conversation on the phone, you either have to turn the volume down to the lowest, if you turn it up so that you can easily hear the other person the sound becomes very distorted and choppy.Based on that one thing, I would not suggest buying this phone.

The PM 8200 also has a horrible speakerphone (it's loud, but very distorted and cuts out when there is cross-talking).  The PM 8200 also distorts the caller's voice slightly.  If you've never had a good cell phone like an LG, (my previous verizon phone was the LG 4400 and callers sounded crystal clear), you may not notice the relatively bad sound quality of most of the Sprint phones.  I returned the 8200 within the 14 day period and instead got the Samsung RL-A760.  The sound is much clearer on this phone with less hissing, but is slightly larger and does not have a camera.  the speakerphone on the Samsung is much better and does not cut out during cross-talking, at least on my end.  overall, the PM8200 is a good phone if you can stand the hissing and distortion.", "Date": "March 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Battery Won't Hold Charge", "Author": "heyyouguys", "ReviewID": "R1CK6HAC45IKH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My battery will not hold more than one bar(if lucky) unless I spend half my day plugging and fiddling with wire.
