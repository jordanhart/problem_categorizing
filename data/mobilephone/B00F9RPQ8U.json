Camera works very well - crisp, clear. More of a zoom would be nice, but very good nevertheless. Only real drawback - wish there were more apps like for iPhone and Android. This is more a windows issue than a Nokia issue. The apps issue is the only thing keeping me from rating it with 5 stars.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F9RPQ8U"}}
