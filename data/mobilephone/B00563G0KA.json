The bootloader is locked, so I cannot remove this software and install a custom ROM running proper Android.The audio player frequently skips and stutters (around 1 to 6 times per song).The battery life is a strong point. This phone's battery lasts an unbelievably long time, especially for a smartphone. That was the reason that I bought it and I am extremely satisfied with the battery life component.The physical design of the phone is also quite nice. I am satisfied with the metal buttons and the heavy gorilla glass of the screen.I guess this would be a good phone for someone, but I can't imagine whom. I will get a phone running vanilla Android next time. These ridiculous devices are sort of ruining the Android brand.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "TXKSSnapper", "ReviewID": "RIEGO9N3UQTCY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the phone because I knew that the bootloader was unlockable at the time.
