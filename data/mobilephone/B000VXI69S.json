I guess it is great for photos, especially since it has the photo editor. The screen is the best feature on this phone. It is big and performs well even in direct sunlight (a plus for the camera users). After 6 photos which I transferred from my Nokia I was told that the memory was full.  My Nokia 6320 has loads of photos and music on it.With regard to ringtones, you'd probably have to buy the memory card, or stick with what they have on the phone.  I was not too enthusiastic about the ringtones the phone came with.  I like naturelike sounds and classic ringtones.  I read a review which said that Sony was targetting the younger folk (I am 45), so that accounts for the type of ringtones and graphics which are embedded in the phone.The slide mechanism is sturdy, as is the keypad.  The slits which represent the select and menu buttons can be a tad difficult if you have long nails, or large fingers (again the target was young folk).The downsides are that the vibrating mechanism is weak and for some reason unknown to me, after 45 minutes of talking on it, the phone cuts off.", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "lovely little phone", "Author": "Aldeta Gumbs", "ReviewID": "RQ8XAGU49TB6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone I have had it two months now and have the say it is the best phone i have bought so far.

Let's look at its pros and cons.Pros:1.  Design is great: its stylish and sleek design allows for easy placement in pants pocket and very attractive looking while using it as a phone.2. All of is features are pretty basic, as another reviewer pointed out, but gets the job done. After all this is a phone known as an MP3/camera phone only.3.  Graphics are are awesome!  The 3 different Themes available are great in their own individual way and satisfy people's taste for expressing they own style.4.  Both the MP3 player and camera are great tools.  Music quality is outstanding, as it should be expected from sony.  The camera takes great pictures and has its own photo editing feature...great for picture messaging.5.  Battery life is very good as I use it for music playback all the time while commuting to/from work.Cons: (My main complaints)1.  Music file transfer is annoying and not that user friendly. Trying to organize my music is a pain as the program does the job for me instead of allowing me to do so.2.  The shuffling of songs is HORRIBLE!  With a 4GB card I get about 1,000 songs, which is good, but when in shuffle mode I get songs that had been already played and others go without ever being played for days!  Manual search for the one song I want takes place.  Sony def. has to work on this one!!!3.  While listening to music and a call or TXT Msg comes in, the music stops for a sec. or two and then resumes.  I think Sony has to make it so when using the MP3 player and a call/txt msg comes in the music should continue and the phone should vibrate or play a light beep to announce such event has happened or at least provide the user with the options.Hope you find this helpful.  Please note that no feedback on keypad was offered as this is phone's feature is not for txt msging, that's if you do a lot of texting and web browsing.Cheers!", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Phone.

The 2MP camera is OK since it does not have auto focus, but it is good for some spontaneous moments where you wish you have a camera on you.

Wonsowski \"wordworks\"", "ReviewID": "R103V0TXD3W4B6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Switched to prepaid minutes with T-Mobile and researched to find I could buy an unlocked phone with SIM card (didn't like any of the T-Mobile phones available). Must purchase a SIM card to use with this unlocked phone.This phone is quite cool, except for the fact that the screen could be larger.  The randomly changing screen saver is a beautiful, along with the mysterious side lighting.  Very fun.  The phone has an AWESOME mp3 player; with supplied earphones your music sounds like a symphony.  Without earphones the music is loud enough to hear but is tinny (as usual).  You will need to purchase a Sony memory stick card, which is different from the familiar micro cards we are used to in cell phones.  Without that you have little space for mp3 files.  The Sony memory is limited to 2gb but is enough for me. Purchase the Sony micro stick along with the phone from the same seller to save on shipping costs...The camera takes nice pictures and videos, and even has a feature to turn the photos landscape, which is good because the screen is rectangular.  Really a beautiful, sturdy phone.However - after purchase I discovered that prepaid T-Mobile offers no data plan to access the Internet unless you purchase their Sidekick phone - which is no longer sold on the T-Mobile website at all.  So, this Sony phone has many great apps and free games from their website that I am unable to access because I have no Internet capability with T-Mobile. Sony also does not let you download any apps or games through your home computer...must be directly through an Internet connection to your phone. This phone will take and send video and picture messages and text messages though.  Just think everyone should know of this limitation.  I thought I did all my homework but somehow missed this when researching prepaid cell phones.  You can sync up to your home computer to transfer picture, video, and mp3 files, which is quick and convenient.Sony customer support was nice and helpful.  T-Mobile support is off-shore but helpful, although time-consuming.Would probably love this phone better with a different service provider where Internet was available through a data plan, but I will keep the phone because of the other positive features.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lasted Less Than 1 Year!", "Author": "Tracy A.
