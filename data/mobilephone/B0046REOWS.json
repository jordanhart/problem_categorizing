Populist", "ReviewID": "R16BTPKBSKLP98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this refurbished cell phone directly from Net10 online as part of a package deal.It was basically free with the purchase of a 30 day/750 minute phone card. I also got the universal accessories kit free.I have used this phone for a month. Last week I dropped it on a hard floor. After putting the battery and cover back on it the phone has shown no damage or problems. It appears to be durable and still works very well.Three things make an impression on me.1) This phone is small. Not clunky.2) Signal reception is great. No dropped calls yet!3) The quality. I expected that a free phone in this price range would be loose or cheaply built. This phone is much better than that.The other surprise was the universal accessory kit which usually goes for around $15. It came free with a promotion code that I used during the purchase.The phone pouch is durable and the attachments are quality items. Everything works including the car charger. If you read the fine print on the Net10 website they normally send the phones with a battery and a home/wall charger.Net10 service is dependable and the phone cards can cost as little as 3 cents/minute up to the 10 cents/minute standard cards available in stores.I did call Net10 customer support to verify my order and out of curiosity about their service. What I found was that the initial response wasn't very good but I was passed off to another service tech who answered my questions quickly. This may be an instance where it depends on the particular tech that answers your call. But I did get an efficient human response to my call.Reloading minutes is easy and hassle-free also.Based on my experience so far I plan on staying with Net10.I would definitely buy this phone again.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love this phone!", "Author": "Ladybug", "ReviewID": "R3J9ST17E1UVAB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We now have three of these phones! Previously, I had bought an LG and the sound quality was not nearly as good and I kept getting dropped calls.This Samsung T201G is the best one we've ever used.Plus, you can go to Walmart,com or to the Target store and get 750 minutes for $25. A great deal, although the minutes don't carry over.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "I am a 6 year user of Net10", "Author": "TLM", "ReviewID": "R34U5PBC9V2ZV0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am shocked to read the one star reviews about Net10!  I have been using Net10 service just over 6 years now.  Yes, you've read it right, 6 years!  I came from AT&T.;  I got tired of being on a plan, so I went from a package with AT&T; to a pay-as-you-go with AT&T.;  When rates started inching up and my bill cost more, it was time for me to switch. I stumbled upon Net10.  They had flip phones, carry over minutes and cost effective pay-as-you-go.  I ordered the phone plus accessories.  It arrived quickly!  Set-up was prompt when I called in and I have that phone, Motorola V171, to this day.  I am currently looking to change, as my family puts it, \"catch up with 2008, at least\" so I am getting a phone that will accept photo texts, so that my sisters can send me photos of my nieces.Now to inform you why I scored them a 4 instead of a 5.  - The customer service is not what is was when I first signed up with them.  When I do call in for a question it takes FOREVER to get someone and then once I do, we have a language barrier, so BE PATIENT.  - I hate that they got rid of their 1 year pre-paid card 1500 minutes for $150 or $100 (I can't remember which one  Now there is a $100 card for 1000 minutes lasting 9 months, I believe.Other than that, if you are in to fancy phones and you're a HEAVY phone user, Net10 may not be for you.  They have 2 pay plans $15(150 minutes) and $25 per month(250 minutes)none are roll over.  Then there is the pay-as-you-go (with roll over minutes).  They don't carry iphones and their phones are approx. 2 years behind the lastest and greatest.I would recommend Net10 for all others who want a cell phone for practical purposes and could care less about the fanciness of a phone.  I hope this helps.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone keeps on Going", "Author": "Linda C", "ReviewID": "R21KMJMPBLLRDJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for Net 10 over a year ago for my 12 year old.  About 4 months ago, my son was playing around and his phone \"flew\" out the window of a moving bus.  We went back and recovered the phone from the side of the road. The battery was about 20 feet away and the cover was in the opposite direction.  To my amazement, we put the phone back together and the phone worked immediately, only had some minor cosmetic damage.  Last night we had a terrible storm and the phone was plugged in and charging. A transformer blew outside and a power surge rushed through my house. The phone started smoking and the back cover melted. The inside is scortched and smells like an electrical fire. To my amazement, after the phone cooled off and stopped smoking, we attempted to turn it on. The phone turned on and worked beautifully!!!  I think this phone is indestructible! I am ordering a new one for my son. Gave him the choice of this stripped down phone or a fancier one. He wants this one because it can't be broken. No complaints!!!!", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone and service for part time usage", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R27S945ABVOU12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this Samsung T201G for nearly two years now, with the Net10 service agreement.  This is an excellent simple phone for part time usage.  I have a landline phone at home so the T201G is used for emergency use, away from home use, etc.  I purchase only 200 mins per month with a plan that cost about 7.5 cents per minute.  With tax, about $16.70 per month for the 200 minutes and service.  Any leftover minutes roll over each month and are never lost as long as you keep the service.  This phone and the Net10 service have been excellent in my opinion.  Talk time is around 4 hours and standby time is almost 2 weeks before charging is needed.  I even purchased a spare battery for when we travel and alternate batteries every couple months.  I love it when my wife goes shopping in town and can keep in touch for such a low monthly cost.If you only need a phone part time for emergency, travel, etc., this is a great bargain.

It worked like a charm, and sound was clear, yet the new phone had an issue with reception.  NET10 has excellent customer service, cost-saving phone plans, and has always resolved any issue I had so I will contact the company.Follow up - When I contacted NET10, a representative called my number to hear the reception and my outgoing greeting, which to me sounded fuzzy.  He said the earpiece on my phone might be damaged since he heard me and the greeting very clearly, and ordered a new phone for me.  I'll return the one I have in a prepaid package.A reliable phone, easy to use and program.  I'd recommend it!", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not that good.", "Author": "E.

I had the first one about 3 years and it proved to be reliable.  I must've dropped if over 60 plus times.  It was all banged up but it still was useful.  I also ordered the T201G for sentimental reasons, convienence/size and the ability to hear it when it rings while I am sleeping. Additionally the carrier offers 750 minutes for only $25.00. Great offer.

I have had touch screen phone and cannot get used to interacting with the screen.  I find it awkward to pick up voice mail and bring up speaker and keypad.  I like this phone simply because it is essentially free, has reliable connections, small and I can dial number, pick up voice mail blind (without looking at the phone).

Good service, easily changed to my old number and easy activation.
