The phone arrived in a sealed package with an at&t; SIM card, and when I tried any other SIM card I got the message \"SIM card not provisioned\".I asked customer care the question - what does unlocked mean? Instead of answering they immediately processed the refund quoting  reason as \"different from website description\" and I returned the phone.However, the website description has not yet changed, so I thought I'd write this review to let potential buyers know that this is an at&t; go phone, and it will work only with an at&t; SIM (may be t-mobile too as advertised, I didn't try that one, but it is definitely not unlocked for use with any GSM SIM card)", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great keyboard... the touchscreen?

When I am trying to scroll through my contact list, it is very bad at figuring out where I'm scrolling or clicking.  And for some reason I can only ever scroll when holding the phone with my left hand.  When I have the phone in my right hand, it does not recognize any thumb swipes whatsoever.  I guess it must have to do with how the swiping algorithm is programmed.

I needed Bluetooth capability, which my previous phone lacked. I have a vacation home that has only a marginal signal in one corner of the second floor, and I wanted a call phone that would connect to an X-Link device that connects to the main phone, which no longer has an outside line. This phone works fine in that regard. My main complaint is that it's virtually impossible to use in the sunlight.

The phone seems prone to this problem. It may have to do with too frequent charging, or excessiveuse of the touch screen.

We downloaded the drivers and software, dutifully jumping through hoops only to find the phones 'can not be detected.'  Tried to pair it with the laptop via USB in our final effort to get photos off the phone - The only thing you can transfer is music.  Tried to get photos to store to the micro SD - not an option.

After a few weeks I called them and told them. talked to the same gentleman, and he said he would send another one out right away. Never got that one either.

She's had it for almost two months now.  She uses it mostly to text, and loves it for that.  It works for phone calls as well.  We haven't had any problems with it -- even though she's dropped it a few times.  The only complaint would be that, since it's not a standard Android phone, we haven't figured out how to download games and music. However, I don't deeply care whether she gets games or music on her phone, so it's fine.  Great phone for the price.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A bad choice!", "Author": "Tawakalitu A.", "ReviewID": "R3VTGWKQ69XHTI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It freezes like 5 times in 30 minutes just trying to set it up for use.

It's ridiculous and frustrating, not to mention the whimsy with which the touch screen zips upwards or downwards at will . Is there any remedy? Someone mentioned about recalibration that can possibly correct this situation and that there is a recalibrate function on the device. I could not locate this function and would appreciate any advise in this connection.
