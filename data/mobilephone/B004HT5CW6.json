{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good as kids emergency phone - purple color is nice", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1S8STGOQYA2SZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I feel more secure having my grade level child carry a phone that is solely used when he needs to, either when his pickup rides didn't show up or other emergencies after school or on family/school field trips. This phone is one of the few left that is simple, works on current Verizon network, and also allow me to turn on location tracking when I need to. My son likes the purple color. The chrome accent/trim gives a real handsome look overall...in my opinion.Since it is 99% on standby in vibrate mode (didn't want to ring in classroom), the phone can last a week on a full battery charge. The re-charging of the battery when low, took less than one hour!", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cute Phone, Different Vendors Available.", "Author": "angelica fox", "ReviewID": "R1JRSWP3RK5J9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone and adore it, it has a music player on the front and a space for a micro mini chip in the back to expand your memory. I'm actually surprised at how long this phone has been available and I still see other people using them.I wanted it for it's color but decided to buy it when I was talking to a girl who had one. She said she had asked the phone place to give her the most durable phone they had and this is what she bought.She also said she had dropped it and put together all the pieces that flew off a hundred times and her phone was still going strong.Even though I haven't dropped mine nearly as much I can imagine I will love it to pieces.Also, as a note to the review saying the seller never responded to them, there are different sellers to buy from.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Motorola Phone", "Author": "CORA HEACOX", "ReviewID": "R17HCJT4XNY100", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy customer!!

The piece missing is the one that covers the plug-in port. I don't know how this will effect its longevity or durability. Also the hinge seems rather flimsy & the phone had the last owner's family photos still in it!! Which could still mean it \"appears to be be new\", but actually wasn't! And if I was the previous owner, I would be horrified if my photos were still in my phone when it was sold to someone else!!! I don't expect it to last very long\u2014with the flimsy hinge, but I'm happy to have gotten a similar replacement to my old one.
