{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I love my GS3, but its not perfect!", "Author": "LoveMyToys", "ReviewID": "R62CQSC1AV4O2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The GS3's sexy specs and glossy good looks (particularly in pebble blue) won me over.  On launch day, I swapped my beloved Droid Razr Maxx, for the Samsung Galaxy S3.  Prior to the Maxx, I briefly owned the Verizon version of the GNexus (which I can't recommend at all).  Before I get into the nitty gritty details, with pro's, con's and comparisons, at the time of this review, this is the phone you have been waiting for--the phone that will make you use that upgrade or cause you to sign a ridiculous contract with Verizon.  After spending ten minutes with the phone, it's an obvious step up from the Razr Maxx and Galaxy Nexus--the former top tier Android phones on Big Red's network.PerformanceAs much as I loved my Razr Maxx (and its marathon 2-3 solid days of battery life), after spending a few minutes with the GS3, the performance leap is very noticeable.  The GS3 is silky smooth, with no lagginess at all.  Apps (particulary heavy duty games like GTA III) launch quickly and are game play is flawless.  I know many of you aren't going to play anything requiring more than the occasional fling of a few angry birds, but the GS3's ability to handle hardcore mobile games with ease is a sure fire indicator that it will be able to run 99.9% of the apps out there in two years.  In other words, this phone has the chops to allow you to make it through your contract without starting a countdown for your next upgrade.How about some real world examples of the GS3's muscle?  The Qualcomm S4 chipset with an industry leading 2gb of Ram can cut through 1080p video files like butter.  Surprisingly, it was able to play back a 23.5 mbps AVCHD file using hardware decoding decoding!!!  I was even able to take play back the file with the video in screen, while I did a couple of google searches. The average $400 laptop would have a tough time handling that!The GS3 doesn't disappoint on the audio side either.  While HTC touts its Beats Audio Technology, that's nothing more than a brand name equilizer setting with limited value-- unless you're spend $100 or more on a beats headphones (which I personally don't care for).  Sammy, on the other hand, dropped in two Wolfson digital to analog converters, which allows the GS3 to pump out lossless high bit rate music with ease.  Using a pair of Etyotic HF3 IEM earphones, sound quality was crisp and clean for music playback.  Even lossy tracks streaming from Amazon Cloud sounded surprisingly full.  Much more so than on some other phones that I own.  In terms of music playback, the GS3 is every bit the equal of the iPhone and possibly a little better.The ScreenThe's GS3's 4.8\", 720p HD screen is a stunner!  The Super AMOLED panel provides rich color saturation and outstanding contrast.  The panel used to make the screen is beautifully fabricated.  the slight curve in the design makes it a pleasure to touch.  Text is crisp and I see no issue with this most recent implementation of pentile technology.  The fuzziness from Galaxy S, GNexus and Fascinate is a thing of the past.  Watching videos on the GS3 is a treat.All is, however, not perfect with the GSIII's screen.  While the contrast and color saturation are strong points for the phone, if you like natural color tones, the pumped up saturation levels may bother you.  Personally, I would dial back the saturation level if I could.  The GS2 had a settings menu that allowed users to tweak brightness, contrast, tint and saturation.  For reasons I don't understand, that great feature was some how left behind on this next gen phone, which is a real pity.While saturation is a matter of taste, the real issue with the screen though is brightness.  Even cranked to 100%, the screen still seems to be a few nits behind the curve.  I would love to be able to dial up to 120%.  The maximum brightness is noticeably less bright than the screen on the Maxx (which Motorola sourced from Sammy).  So, what gives?  I am not sure, but my best guess is that in the interest of improving battery life and to compensate for the size of the screen (and the power that size screen will suck), Sammy choose to put a software restriction that limits the ability of users to pump of the brightness.  Hopefully, this can be cured by a future firmware update.While the brightness could use a boost, this deficiency is further amplified by awful auto-brightness implementation.  When auto-brightness is turned on, the phone makes sudden and drastic adjustments in brightness even in a consistently well lit setting.  It seems as if the software has only 3 settings for brightness when it is set to auto--low, medium and high (which isn't that high to begin with).  The phone will drop from high to low suddenly, leaving the screen unreadably dark.  Until Sammy sends out a software update to fix the problem, I have disabled the auto-brightness feature.Software ImplementationThe user interface for this latest version of touchwiz is really very nice.  This phone provides IOS levels of comfort and ease of use to a smartphone beginner, but allows the flexibility for the nerds among us to customize the phone to suit our needs and tastes.  CNET and Phonedog have done excellent video reviews on the GS3's user interface and software features and highly recommend that  you check them out (Amazon won't allow links to outside sites--so you'll have to google them).I do have a few software gripes, one of which could effect some peoples' buying decision.One of the purported advantages of the GS3 over its top competitors from the HTC One line of phones is the fact that the GS3's has a micro SD card slot and accepts up to 64gb cards.  Android allows must apps to be saved and launched from the micro SD cards.  This feature allows low and mid-range phones to be made with limited internal storage because users can add their own cards.Sammy, however, wants power users to buy the bigger capacity 32gig phones for an extra $50.  To force us to buy the step up model, Samsung disable the ability to move apps from internal storage to the micro SD card.  I am not sure of the size of the app partition in the phone, but I hope Sammy didn't put too big of a restriction on internal storage or that could be a problem for some people down the road.  I understand why Sammy made the decision to disable the feature, but it seems like a low rent Apple type move to me and, in fairness, the HTC One series doesn't accept SD cards at all (nor does the iPhone nor any of the current Windows 7 phones).Another small grip I have is with Sammy's decision not to incorporate ICS's native ability to generate folders for apps simply by stacking one app icon on top of another .  Motorola incorporated this feature on its ICS update to the Razr and its native to ICS, so why force us to have to press the menu screen, select create folder and than drag and drop files?  Sammy, that's very Gingerbread of you.  A good UI should use the strengths of the underlying Software and improve on the weakness--not just make changes for change sake.  This is one of the few areas that the Sammy's \"Nature\" UI seems to fall short.Battery LifeGripes are over for now. :)  The batter life on the GS3 seems pretty decent.  I have had it off the charge since 8:30 this morning (its 4:47 in the afternoon), and have been using the phone heavily.  Screen on time is about 2:53 minutes.  I have done some light web surfing--shopped on ebay and amazon for a new case for the sammy.  Send about 7 or 8 emails, 10-12 tests, and made about 80 minutes worth of phone calls.  Brightness is set to around 90% (auto-brightness is disabled).  I even played about 15 to 20 minutes of GTA III, and watch about 20 minutes of an episode of Lost on Netflix.  It's now 6:33 in the evening and the battery says it has 62% remaining.  I would still be in the mid-80's with the Razr Maxx and the GNexus would have been dead or on the charger a few hours ago.I would say the battery is good--but it's not close to being in the same league as the Maxx.  The fact that it is removable, however, does give it a major step up on phones like the HTC One (X-S), Razr (original), Sony ION, iPhone 4S and Atrix HD.  In short, if you are on Verizon and don't need the Maxx's 2 full days worth of battery life, I would take the GS3 over the Razr Maxx (which is exactly what I did).  [Edited 7/26/12: I ordered two 2300mah batteries with a wall charge from QCell for $24.00 from Amazon last week.  These batteries performed as good or better than OEM and had NFC capabilities.  This eliminated the need for a huge internal battery from my perspective, although there are plenty of 3500 and 4000mah extended batteries available for the GS3.  If you're coming from anything other than a flip phone or Razr Maxx, you will have no complaints about the battery life--This phone absolutely smokes my old iPhone 4 in terms of battery life).CameraThe camera on the GS3 gets top marks.  It uses an updated version of the same 8MP Sony sensor used in the iPhone 4S.  Unlike the iPhone 4S, there are options galore for tweaking your photos.  I am really impressed with the sharpness of the phones, even in low light.  Depending on the shot, the camera on the GS3 (and photo quality in general) is very comparable to photo quality on the Nokia 808  and iPhone 4S.Video quality is on par with the photo quality.  It shoots very smooth 1080p video.  Color is good and the video quality is genuine HD quality for most shots.  If you shooting a sporting events or other fast paced action, or are pan quickly, there is a lag in time while the camera gets in focus.  In fairness, I see the same issue with the iPhone 4S and I have yet to see a smart phone camera do better.  Audio quality on the camera is also quite good.Call Quality and ReceptionI have had no problems with reception at all.  Unlike its GNexus stable mate,  the qualcomm radio and baseband in the GS3 are top notch.  I have excellent signal strength on Verizon's network.  Call quality is excellent.  The people I called say that I sound like I am on a landline--and they sound just as clear to me.  Data on Verizon's 4G LTE Network is also strong.  I located in the metro NY area.  I am consistently pulling 18-24mbps download and 9-16mbps upload speeds on the 4G Network.  I get strong reception for Wifi and great broadcasting for Bluetooth as well.Comparison with CompetitorsI have no regrets about trading up from the GNexus to the Razr Maxx and even less regret about trading from the Maxx to the GS3.  Despite its plastic build, I think the phone does have a premium feel.  It's not as solid as the Maxx, but no one is going to look at the pebble blue version of the GS3 and thinks--that thing looks cheap.  It's comfortable to hold.  The HTC One X has a sharper, brighter screen and a camera that is on par with the GSC's.  The lack of a user removable battery is a big knock against the HTC One series however.  The iPhone is, well, an iPhone.  As nice as the iPhone 4S may be (and it's great phone), the lack of LTE capability and low data rates on Verizon's CDMA network make it a no go for me.  On ATT, however, it can take advantage of higher HSPA+ speeds, but ATT's network has been having some issues lately.  For that reason alone, if I am married to ATT or am on Sprint or Verizon for that matter, I am taking the GS3 over the iPhone 4S.ConclusionThis is a solid phone and a no brainer if you are on the market for a phone right now and have $200.00 in your pocket!", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "DONT read the one-star reviews, those people are just moping about a dumb issue...I'll explain.", "Author": "Brian Rokosz", "ReviewID": "R24LMYLPAMWHFB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Galaxy S3 is a 4.0.3 Android ICS 4.8\" AMOLEDHD 720P 2GB of RAM, fantastic device.The features that this phone has are top-tier and the gesture control (while gimmicky) is amazing to show off.  I still keep a few on cuz they come in handy.The device is also incredible fast and smooth, and the screen looks perfect.  People will complain that this has a PENTILE display, which has faced very harsh reviews on other phones.  However, due to the high-resolution display there are so many pixels that the PENTILE isn't noticable at all.  The saturation really adds to the screen and all of the colors pop.The quickness is partially due to Verizon, but mostly due to the S4 processor inside which easily matches the Tegra 3 quad-cores in tablets and the overseas version of this.In short, for $200 you won't find a better new phone.  The speaker on the back is loud, the sound is amazing, the earbuds this comes with are actually pretty good, the processing power is phenominal.The camera is also the best of any phone...its essentially the iPhone 4S's camera...that Samsung made for them...but tweaked to use more cool features.The front camera works wonders with Tango and Google+...both are Android/Google's \"Facetime\" and work with anyone who has a front camera, unlike Facetime, which requires iOS.The people that give this bad reviews are doing so because of Verizon, not the phone itself.  Verizon decided to opt out of a lot of things that people want this phone for:1) NFC...payments made from the phone using a wireless connection and Google Wallet were switched off by Verizon, all other carriers get it.2)Dropbox--a cloud based storage system.  This phone comes with 50GB of dropbox storage...25GB on some carriers...Verizon's gets 0GB3) The bootloader, or way to easily root the device and get inside to tweak everything about the device (what Android is best for since everything is open-source) is locked and encrypted...Verizon is the only one refusing to open it.4) Onboard apps--Verizon's tools like backup wifi detection always turn on and interupt what I'm doing.  In fact, when opening ANY app that uses data, Verizon has a big pop up that asks you to switch to an open wifi so you dont use their data...you have to physically hit the \"no\" every single time...even when checking facebook you have to.  It's sooooo anoying.So, in summary, this is the best phone in the world..no exaggeration, literally every website, including Mac World, rave about this thing...Verizon's version is severly limited due to them being greedy, arrogant, idiotic...well you get the idea.If you want easy access to rooting, hacking(which is encouraged with android devices...google even awards people who hack into their devices to improve them...the Nexus Q being the best example...during the reveal of the device at their conference they stopped to tell people how hackable it is)...get the Galaxy Nexus or wait until this Christmas when the next \"Nexus\" device is out.  I for one, was just tired of waiting and this device was the last one to allow me my unlimited data.If you have questions, ask.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone, 5* despite nitpicks", "Author": "davepy", "ReviewID": "R3TWURGN29BSIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for the 16GB, blue, Verizon S3.Owned for 5 days now, and played with extensively, but not rooted.  Fantastic upgrade from my Droid X.  ICS by itself is worth the price ($199 from the Verizon store, btw).  Hardware seems plenty fast despite not being the quad-core international version.  16 GB + a 32 GB sd card gives me plenty of storage.  4G LTE is blazing fast at my location (SE Michigan).ICS, how do I love thee?  I can finally disable all the annoying Verizon (& Samsung) apps w/o rooting (though you need to root to fully uninstall them).  Multitasking is greatly improved (hint: long-press home button).  Stock apps are almost good enough to stick with (almost, not quite, esp. the keyboard & browser).Hardware: good camera, fantastic AMOLED display.  Pentile, sure, but can you really tell?  HD movies look gorgeous and play smoothly.  Decent speaker for speakerphone or listening to podcasts.  The display is huge, and the phone is a bit big for one-handed operations, but it's also thin and fits in your pocket no problem.  Oh, and it looks great.  Almost a shame to put a case on it.Good battery life.  I've been going a full day on a single charge with medium-heavy usage with plenty to spare.  Not watching movies or anything that requires the LCD to be on for hours at a time, obviously, but for most usage, you should be fine just plugging in at night.Nitpicks:Major 1 - Power button placement on the right, usb port on the bottom.  I'm hitting the volume keys on the left far too often when turning on/off the phone.  Could just be personal preference as I'm used to the power button on top on the Droid.  USB port on the bottom makes no sense though.Major 2 - No MSC (Mass Storage Control) transfer, only MTP & PTP.  Less flexibility in dragging & dropping files, folders, etc from your computer.  Sure, there are ways around this, but is annoying nonetheless.Minor - so, yeah, big display, and if you have small-ish hands, 1-handed operations are risky, esp w/the somewhat slippery case.  I don't actually mind the plastic construction--doesn't feel \"cheap\" to me at all--but I'll likely get a TPU case for the grippiness.Shortcuts on your lockscreen is a great feature!  Except you have to unlock the phone to actually launch the apps.  Why can't I turn on my flashlight or calculator (zero security risks) on demand?  No ring/vibrate switch from the lockscreen either.Anyway, plenty of software nits that can be fixed by downloading replacement apps or rooting.  Really, it's the MSC & power button that might tempt me to leave the G3 a 4* review, but honestly, I just love the phone to death right now, which is kind of the bottom line.  Maybe it was just the degree of upgrade after 2 years, but whatever, it's a fantastic phone that I was happy to pay full price for at launch, instead of waiting a month or two for it to get discounted.Edit: 7/26.  Added thoughts after 2 weeks of ownership and experience of travel (air & driving) with the phone (because this review wasn't long enough!).Pro - GPS locks very quickly.  The DX took a long time to lock onto GPS signals, but the SG3 is almost instantaneous when outdoors (or inside of a car that is outdoors).  Gets rid of a huge peeve for my previous phone.Pro - Camera features work well, esp. the Best Shot mode.  Took some very nice pictures at a wedding.Con - Button placement redux (see Major 1 above).  I asked many people to take pictures for me, and they invariably hit the volume button by accident which operates the digital zoom.  Very natural to place your left thumb there in landscape mode.  A good case might alleviate this.Semi-con - This is 100% on me, but don't get too cocky about the Gorilla Glass 2.  I managed to scratch it a tiny bit in the 2 weeks thinking it was invincible, and it's not.  Keys & coins may be fine, but rough kitchen surfaces are not (granite, sandstone, etc).

Let me enumerate this a bit for you.1. The automatic WiFi pop-up was a little tough to swallow. In case you haven't heard, even with the WiFi turned completely off and having gone through the advanced options to make sure it doesn't come on, it actually is still on and scanning. If you've attached to a wireless network in the past, it remembers that connection and pops-up a dialog asking if you want to connect to it to save on your 4G data usage. Super annoying at first. But then I thought why wouldn't I want it to connect. Generally speaking, it's going to be just as fast (maybe faster if you've connected to an N router) so let it auto-connect. Saves on battery and it is fairly seamless. I just wouldn't connect it to a coffee shop network. Stick to the 4G for that.2. You can't download/install/move applications to your SD card. It all goes to the on-board system memory. To some, myself included, this is a problem. If I have an application on my phone and it goes bad, I want to be assured that the data is still retrievable on the SD card. Luckily, most of my applications have an auto backup feature. If my phone does die I don't have to worry a great deal. It's being backed up on-the-fly. Default your music and photos to be stored on the SD card and you're golden. Those are the big space-wasters anyway. Still, you should consider the pros and cons of the 16GB vs the 32GB GSIII.3. OK, it's a petty complaint, but this whole white cell phone thing that Apple started is dumb. The only other option is the \"Pebble Blue\", which is really an odd shade of purple. I dislike white and I don't want a blue phone. I figured a case would solve most of that. I know, I know... it's a dumb complaint, but I like my black and gun metal gray. *shrug*4. The camera is really nice! The bad part is that there are no built-in features for editing your photos save an option to crop. This is still a thorn in my side, but if I must download yet another app, I suppose I will.5. I was skeptical on the battery size and usage time. My Droid X (after customizations) would get about 12-14 hours on a single charge. That's going easy on texts, emails, browsing the web and Bluetooth usage. None-the-less, it was a decent amount of time for the 2nd-ish generation of Android smart phones. Especially when you compare it to the paperweight HTC Incredible. Happily the SGIII battery stands up to many hours of Bluetooth, texting, browsing and what-not with the same 12-14 hours. So I have really gained a considerable amount of usage time with the SGIII over the \"X.\"6. There is no skepticism on this one; the screen is a-mazing! It truly blows me away every time I look at a picture or video.I've had the SGIII for one week and had zero issues with it. I would fall in love with my Droid X twice a week. Leaving behind all I had come to know and love about the \"X\" was tough. I've come to the understanding that comparing the tech in the SGIII with your outdated phone is night and day. Yes, you may like some of the features of your old phones' capability, but all-in-all you're going to really like the SGIII. Keep an open mind about it.Parenthetically, to those that are comparing this to the iPhone - stop. You either like apples or robots. If the iPhone works better for you, go get one and stop the bias commentary.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best phone on the market!", "Author": "R. B. Ray \"Rus Ray\"", "ReviewID": "R184TEU3J3PKV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Galaxy S3 is without a doubt the best phone for ME. Before you purchase this phone I urge you to really think about your needs, and stack them against this review. This review is based on an unrooted phone on Verizon Wireless. If you don't feel like reading all of the specifics, skip down to the end and just check out the pros and cons.Feel/DesignThe body of the Verizon Galaxy S3 is very smooth and fits well in your hand; it is a plastic build which allows the phone to remain light. I personally am terrified of dropping it due to the case. I purchased a silicone case just to keep the back scratch free and provide a little cushion in case dropped. The power button is located on the right side of the phone near the top, and a volume rocker is located on the left side near the top. There is a home button on the front of the screen near the bottom on the center. Very simple. One small complaint is the battery cover: you have to somewhat pry it off starting with a little slip on top center of the phone. Directly left of that is the headphone input. Another disappointment to me is the way the speaker is placed; it's on the rear of the phone and if you have the phone on a flat table, it muffles the sound from the speaker.ScreenYou're going to be working with a 4.8-inch Super AMOLED HD display. It's an amazing display. Much more bright than my wife's iPhone 4S. It seems to have a more crisp look. If you aren't used to a large screen, the S3 will take a little getting used to. Coming from an original Motorola Droid, I was a little offput by the large size of this phone. In the month that I've had it I've gotten so used to it that now when I pick up my iPod touch, my immediate reaction is, \"why did they design this screen so small?\" It is also worth noting that the screen is made from Gorilla Glass 2Performance1.5 GHz S4 processor and 2GB of RAM? Yes please. I have never had so much as a hiccup with this phone, despite running as many memory intensive programs and games as I can. The home screens run smoothly even using Go Launcher as a home replacement. I haven't found a thing that my S3 can't run flawlessly.Connectivity (Signal Strength)I'm currently in San Diego, CA. The only time I do not get 4G is when I'm on the island of Coronado, and even then it just cuts in and out. Everywhere else I have been in San Diego, I get exceptional service. Doing a speed test, I routinely get around 12 Mbps; that is as fast as my home internet connection.Battery Life2100 mAh battery. Doing a looped video test, I can squeeze about 9 hours 15 minutes out of my phone. The only time my battery life isn't wonderful is when the phone is maxed out searching for signal on Coronado. Moderate use: playing games, making calls, using Tapatalk, checking my Google+, Twitter, Flipboard, and reading other news articles, I can usually get a good 16 hours of battery life.OSI could write several pages just on how much better ICS is than any other Android build I've used, but I'm going to leave it to you to research this. The ability to customize my phone is invaluable to me, which is why I always choose Android over Apple.Camera8-megapixel rear camera, 1.9-megapixel front camera. One of the biggest reasons I wanted a phone upgrade was the camera. The Motorola Droid camera was so slow that it made capturing unique moments nearly impossible. The speed on the S3 camera is stellar. The dual-core cpu does a great job at giving great speed and performance with virtually no lag. The quality of the pictures is also fantastic. My S3 outperforms my wife's iPhone 4S in picture quality by far.GimmicksS Voice - The microphone picks up too much ambient noise, especially when driving. When in quiet places, I generally have a pretty good success rate when using S Voice, but I'm really hoping when Jellybean gets pushed to the S3 that Google Now will really pick up the slack.Pop Up Play - I've never used it, as I see no practical use in it.Share Shot - would be a great feature if the only phone in the world was the S3ProsBeautiful screenGorilla Glass 2Smooth running OSSpeedy, high quality camera4GRobust customization optionsFast GPS lock (I didn't mention this in the review, but the GPS lock on this phone is incredibly fast)ConsLocked Bootloader (Verizon only)No Google Wallet (such a horrible move on Verizon's part)Battery cover hard to remove (minor complaint but still worth noting especially if you ever need to change your battery)Speaker placementConclusion: You would be a wise man indeed to purchase a Samsung Galaxy S3.

Has many nice features but there is always a 10% chance that something (mainly mobile data/GPS) wont work right away. Dont know how much of this is a Verizon model specific issue.Pros1. The display - generally great with some over-saturation of colors. If you have average sized hands (for a man), then the phone isnt too big to handle. It is actually quite sleek and light and would also fit easily into trouser pockets.  The large screen you get in return is totally worth it - makes reading, watching clips etc much more enjoyable. I have barely used my ipad since and would now be hard to go to a phone with a smaller screen.2. Respectable battery life.

Weaker Reception - When on 3G, data speed is slower than my 3G - HTC . Also often fails to receive 3G data signal when a Blackberry and the HTC also on Verizon seem to manage okay.2. Lousy 3G-4G transition - Often indicates to be on 4G but then fails miserably when a data request is made. Takes over a minute to switch to 3G. From time to time, gets stuck in 3G and wouldnt switch to 4G even if you go to a strong 4G area. Nothing short of a wholesale restart would make it go to 4G. Dont know how much of this is a Verizon issue. I have changed SIM cards once, but the problem recurred.3. Can get uncomfortably warm.4. Interface - This is mixed. Some elements (quick access pull-down bar, ability to hide bloatware, shortcuts) are handy, others poorly thought of. Given the large form-factor, a soft home button would have been much better than the physical one. Also the default setting is for a double tap home to launch S-Voice. This leads to a pretty slow response time if you just need to single tap to go to home screen.  It is a setting easy to change, but illustrates that usability wasnt always thought through in designing the interface. The stock dialer is also lacking.5. GPS is generally very slow to lock.

This phone with small tweaks which make a huge difference has really become a new phone)I really love this phone..i hope you find my review useful cause i spent time to write it for you people that are deciding ...best of success to you in choosing.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Android Phone To Date", "Author": "Nathan Stainbrook", "ReviewID": "R29RM64GGP9LHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is IMO the best android phone to date. It has a few minor bugs that could easily be ironed out with a update from the manufacturer. I will suggest one thing to do to make this phone run to its fullest potential, get rid of touchwiz by using either the Apex Launcher, or NovaLauncher. Those two launchers are specifically made for the current version of android (ICS). Do not use GO Launcher. Now for the list of things that make this phone the best android phone to date.The S4 processor with two gigs of ram.The Large 4.8 inch screen, which more than holds it own against all comers.The Camera is the best camera you can get on a phone right now bar none.The Battery life is the best on a smartphone outside of the Maxx, one suggestion would be to limit your background processes by going into developer options and change how many background processes your phone will allow.The Gesture controls are a very nice touch.The form factor is very sleek and sexy.Now for a list of things I don't like quite as much.The power button seems a bit flimsy to me, makes me wonder how it will hold up for two years.The signal is not quite as good as it should be for a phone made in 2012, but it is still very solid nonetheless. I get better signal than I did on my Nexus.Touchwiz is a bit clunky; but as I mentioned above that can be easily remedied by using Apex or Nova.Overall, I would recommend this phone to ANYONE.

I'm really loving this phone even though few little things that bug me. I got my phone from eBay brand new, I got the 32GB pebble blue on Verizon. Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here. I know you could always do things to get better battery than I've been having, I personally don't care to root this yet or do any of the tweaks. I can work this phone hard, I mean constant youtube videos, some games, taking pictures, making some phone calls and stuff, and doing some e-mails (4 email accounts).. even though I don't sync but 6 minutes on every hour. I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take. My other phones would be about dead just about, I'd be hurrying to charge a spare up after 8 or 9 hours.I really love the slick design of the phone.. some people say very cheap feeling or quality but I feel complete opposite and they are probably idiots anyways. I have several very nice cases and screen protector on this baby.. have a glass tempered one and loving it, feel I have that protection in case a drop (let's hope not).Only thing at this point I don't really like with phone so far is when I open one of my folders or close, I have the ladys voice-  Folder open/Folder closed.. This bugs the crap out of me. I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.

It's also incredible in low light situations. HD video is sweet also. And wow is it tough. I was on the treadmill and I dropped mine. It hit the belt and spun off across my cement floor.

So take this short review with a grain of salt.The phone itself is great. Makes wonderful calls, has beautiful screen and has a wonderfully smooth feel to the glass screen. The performance has been wonderful, and I haven't had any application incompatibilities so far.The camera is wonderful. My brother and I were competing against each other to take the best picture of our dad who was running in a race (aka. an action shot), and we both agreed that this phone did better than his really nice digital SLR camera.The biggest (and only) shortfall is that this phone has poor battery life from what I'm used to with past \"dumb phones.\" When I don't use it that much, the battery will last about a day and a half. However, if I'm doing GPS navigation or taking pictures, the phone's battery will drain very quickly. Of course, battery life is highly dependent on settings that the owner has configured for the phone. Also, I live in a rural area with poor cell-phone signal (no matter what carrier), so that has largely impacted my phone's battery life. I would expect that if I went to a less rural area, the battery life would increase substantially.The phone comes with the following:-The Samsung Galaxy SIII Smartphone-Ear bud headphones with microphone, call control button, and volume adjustment-Battery-Charger with USB to micro USB cable", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Thoughts 2 months in", "Author": "Dale E.

I'm going to tell you my specific reasons for giving this phone 2 stars after having it for 2 months.I can boil it down to one thing then list specifics - the one thing is certain things stop working and can only be fixed by a reboot of the device.  I didn't move from a 2 year old HTC product to the flagship Samsung product in order to have to reboot my device 3 to 5 times a day just to make basic functions work.1.  Voice input - the mic icon will sometimes not light up red or work, like the application cannot access the mic.  Only fix I have found is to reboot the phone, and it works immediately.2.  Bluetooth music to my car stereo stutters.  It didn't do this on my older phones which are half as powerful.  A reboot fixes it.3.  GPS cannot get a fix.  \"Searching for GPS\" will not go away.  It will not get a fix.  Toggling GPS on and off does not work.  A reboot fixes it.4.  Drops wi-fi alot.  Wifi disconnects, goes to 3g / 4g, then back to wifi ... all day long.  Don't tell me it's my router or my signal.  My old phone did not do this.  My girlfriend's phone doesn't do this.5.  Apps stop responding - freeze up - screen sticks for 15-20 seconds sometimes.  This shouldn't be happening on a phone this powerful.6.  Intermittently can't upload photos - to facebook, twitter, etc.  They fail immediately.  Reboot of phone fixes it every time.7.  And this one is probably Verizon ... switching between Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G on the fly is not exactly smooth.  Connection invariably drops and takes more time than it should to pick back up.I first went to Amazon with the issue.  They told me to go to Verizon as it was past 30 days.  Verizon would not let me e-mail customer service about it from their website.  They want me to bring it to a retail store, which I have not had time to do yet.  I e-mailed Samsung.  They offered some troubleshooting - which was basically instructions on how to do a soft reset, then how to do a complete wipe of the phone if that didn't fix my issues.  Soft reset did not fix it.  I'm not really wanting to do a complete wipe at this point on a 2 month old phone.  In any case I shouldn't have this many problems on a brand new flagship device from a major carrier.  I tried to get Amazon to send me a device in advance and return packaging for the old one.  No dice.  I tried with Samsung.  No dice.  Verizon is my last hope and I really don't relish the thought of setting my phone up all over again ... but I guess it's my only chance of getting any kind of decent smart phone that is even as good as my 2 year old phone I just got rid of.

I have very mixed feelings about the galaxy sIII but have found that most of the time this phone works great for me. Personally, I feel that the size of the phone and the slim feel are great attributes but others may find it a tad too large for their hands. Also, I found that with a large case the phone can be very bulky, thus i purchased a smaller slimmer case and was much happier. The screen is great, no cracks and I have dropped it multiple times (whoops...). My only problem with the screen is in comparison to an IPhone, the resolution and pixels just are not as clear. Most of the physical aspects of the phone are great and fit me perfectly. My faults with this phone come in the operating system and software. The software is iffy with Verizon. I feel that on jellybean, the next android operating system, this phone would work much smoother and have less of a lethargic feel to it when scrolling through and general everyday use would be easier. Also, although the market is catching up, there are still some apps available on the apple market that are not available on the Google play store. Don't get me wrong i'm an android lover and really support all the great opportunities with android phones but compared to the newest Iphone 5 this phone does lack a little. Even with mixed reviews on the iPhone 5 and the lack of any real improvements to the phone, it still outperforms and looks sleeker than the GSIII in my opinion. Overall conclusion about this phone is that it looks and feels great, the operating system is a little slow and different from apples IOS which some may prefer but with JellyBean hopefully being released for this phone soon, we could see a huge improvement in this phones stats. I would recommend this phone to any android lover or someone in search of a smartphone cheaper than an IPhone 5.

And what an upgrade it was. I admit, I thought about buying the iPhone 5 and even the 4S on Verizon, but after my wife got the 4S and I spent some quality time with the phone, I was less than impressed with all of the hype. And after being tied in to the Android/Google operating system for the past few years, I wanted some continuity. Let me tell you, I am not looking back.The SIII is an incredible phone (much more so than my prior phone, regardless of the name). On the hardware, the screen is crisp and the user interface is intuitive through ICS. I like having a dedicated menu button and the lack of such hardware-based menu button on the iPhone made it a frustrating experience for me. The SIII is also an unusually large phone, but it is intended to be a content consumption device, although its size may be a deterrent for some. The only downside is that the lock button is on the right side of the phone directly across from the volume toggle button that also controls the ringer volume/vibrate/silent status and not on the top of the phone. This placement has caused me to unintentionally change the ringer status while trying to lock the phone given how I hold the phone. But besides that tweak, the hardware is solid and the camera is great. Notwithstanding other reviews here, I found the actual design and form factor of the phone to be a positive.As for the software, I have no complaints. In fact, the more I use the phone, the more I like it. Tap into the Google Play store to load your favorite apps, and the SIII feels and functions as good as or better than any desktop or laptop I have ever had.  I recognize that in another few months, there will likely be a better phone in the market, but this phone feels like a jump in technology and innovation from just a short while ago. And the good news - I am glad I don't have the iPhone and don't feel left out at all.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better Phone Than I Expected; Bugs Seemed To Have Been Largely Eliminated", "Author": "J. Bellin \"analog_j\"", "ReviewID": "R19XZW35V2DEOI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the phone for about two weeks now and am really enjoying it.  If I could design one from scratch, this might not be it, but from what I have seen out there currently as of the first week of February of 2013, this is one terrific option.The main downside, for me, is its large size.  I came from a Droid X and that, to me, was a perfect-sized phone.  It had enough of a screen size to read text and see internet browsing well, but it also fit comfortably in my hand.  I find that the Galaxy S III is a bit too large for me to comfortably use one-handed, but I'm getting used to using it.That being said, I had had a few concerns to begin with about the phone.  While the phone had come out like gangbusters with great reviews when it was first released the middle of last year, users have had some issues with it, along with less than responsive Samsung customer service, giving me pause.Two of the issues were the GPS not locking in well, and phone call quality.  Both of those would be deal killers for me.  I'm not needing this for gaming.But the phone's upsides intrigued me as well as a great price through Staples of $99.  I can tell you that the GPS has locked in VERY quickly, more quickly than my Droid.  Secondly, call quality has been adequate.  Interestingly, the phone's built-in signal gauge has put the signal at 106, which is terrible.  Yet, I was getting very decent quality calls (clear, but a bit tinny sounding).  I downloaded a separate meter app and it detected my 3G/4G and interior WiFi reception were both at close to 80, which is fine.Meanwhile, the screen is sharp and colors are MUCH more accurate than the one on the Motorola Razr Maxx HD.  Yeah, perhaps the screen isn't as bright, but it actually works better in dark situations better, and watching video renders a much better, more film-like visual than the much brighter phones.  The speed of the processor seems to also help with watching streamed videos, which come out smoother than with the Droid X.  I also find that if I turn off the auto-brightness, I can get a much brighter screen.Touch response is incredibly quick.  I can definitely sense an improvement from my Droid X.  The built-in speaker is much louder than the Droid X, though somewhat tinny.  Still, I can hear my Stephanie Miller Show podcast straight out of the speaker better.Yes, the camera is also better and the shutter response is very quick.  Still, my standalone point and shoot, a Fuji E550 takes better pictures, but I didn't buy the phone for that.  On the other hand, the photos I have taken are FAR superior to the ones I got from my Droid X.  I'm really surprised as to how good they are.  Still, for depth of color and subtlety, my point and shoot is better, not to mention that it takes RAW files, which are completely uncompressed.A BIG upside is the removable battery, not only for long days I might be away from an A/C port or charger, but that I can force a hard reboot when I need it.  Do all phones with non-replaceable batteries have a hard reboot option, and do they always work?Two niggling things -- The placement of the on/off button and volume up/down buttons are about on opposite sides about 2/3rds way up the sides of the phone.  It makes holding the phone precarious in terms of touching one or both buttons inadvertently.  You may have turned off the volume of the phone unknowingly so that you may not hear a phone call coming in.The other thing is the built-in Samsung Swype-like keyboard.  I like tracing the text.  Swype worked very well, though not perfectly on my Droid X.  As others have noted, the Samsung version has an awful way with predictive text.  You could trace \"Samsung\" and up will come \"monkey\", leaving both you and the monkey scratching your heads.  The actual Swype software is also built into the phone.  Great, right?  Well, it, too, has some bugs in this version.  If it predicts a word that is inaccurate (It is generally more accurate than the Samsung version), you would think backspacing would bring you back to the word to its left.  Unfortunately, it deletes the word, but then tabs to the next line and/or also deletes to the right.  Even weirder, if I backspace twice, it will paste the whole sentence to the right of it into the space, resulting in repeated text.  Very odd.In any event, I'm still discovering nice things that have been improved in the Android OS (currently Jelly Bean) from the Android 2.x which was running the Droid X. There's a much better cut/copy/paste ability by simply holding down your finger over text.  Holding down the menu button renders much more information about what is open on the phone.Unfortunately, almost all of the US phones are going bigger, not smaller. The smaller smartphones didn't have as much capability such as processor size or RAM.  The Galaxy S III is more future-proof, at this point, than competitive phones.Samsung is rumored to come out with the Galaxy S IV in April.  There is also a Mini Galaxy S III, but it's not available in the US.  I might have gone for that with the smaller size, but I think I made a great choice.

The S3 is a great phone to own for beginners. It's a very easy to navigate phone. Straight out of the box it's easily accessible.You need a google account to set up your phone when you first turn it on. Google account will hold all in the information about all the apps you download, your number, and much more.If you set up Facebook to your phone it will give you the option to sync your friends list with your contact list. So all your friends information is straight at your fingertips.I like the phone's swype feature while texting when I can't use both hands for whatever reason or I don't want to turn down the volume but want to quietly text.The phone's ringer is loud. My only complaint is when I turn my phone on silent or vibrate it does NOT silent the alarms set. I've been at a funeral thinking my phone was on silent when my 3pm alarm went off and was louder than ever. How embarrassing.The call quality is very nice. I have very few times where I've dropped a call but that very well could be because of the area I was in and not the actual phone itself. You can hear your callers clearly and loudly. There is an option to have 'noise reduction' turned on/off and there is also an option for extra volume turned on/off while on a call.Another complaint I have is when I am on the phone and need to do something like text message I will hit the 'home' key located in the middle of phone on the bottom. It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do. Unfortunately when I go to slide down the notification window so I can get back to my call my phone locks up and turns off. Every time my finger gets to the top bar it turns off, when i lift my finger away from the phone it turns back on. It's VERY frustrating because normally I cannot go back and do anything with the call until they hang up and end the call. Sometimes I can get around this by continuously doing it and eventually getting the notification window to slide down but most of the time I cannot.The 8MP camera is fairly good quality. I have some instances where my pictures turn out blurry or grainy but that's more than likely due to the light source and or shaky hands and not necessarily the phones fault. There are a lot of different options you can do with the phone automatically out of the box. Changing the photo from a negative, sepia, black and white, cartoonified, washed out, show just yellow, just red, just blue, and just green, solarize, posterize, and warm and soft vintage. If you want to crop or edit your photos you will need to download a different app though because nothing comes with the phone to do this.The battery life is decent. I can usually spend a total of 8 hours total with non-stop internet use (Facebook, Twitter, browser, etc) and get down to about a 30% battery. It usually takes all day for my battery to go down. I don't know how battery life is with non-stop streaming videos on say Youtube or Netflix because I don't use those often but when my children have it took a bit to run the battery down.  It takes roughly 2-3 full hours to charge the battery from 5% to full charge. I have absolutely no complaints about the battery life of this phone. It has been excellent for me.Overall, this is a great phone. The complaints I have are minor and more than likely users fault not the phones.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone, some weaknesses, some strengths", "Author": "J. Donaldson \"Cal-diver\"", "ReviewID": "R4PL7MPXWZWIH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I didn't buy this here on Amazon but wanted to comment.The #1 biggest attraction for me with this phone is the user replaceable battery. When the battery begins to fade and won't hold a charge as long as it once did I'll be able to purchase a new battery for a few dollars and pop it in. I suppose I could carry a spare battery but my concern is more for the end-of-life situation. I wouldn't appreciate sending my phone away for a few days and paying $75 to $125 to have a new battery installed.I've been using another phone with a 4\" screen which was fine. The larger screen of the S3 is fine but the extra bulk makes it just a bit large for my hands. This isn't a big enough problem to reject the phone though. It as a lot going for it in many areas. Surprisingly even with the larger screen this isn't a heavy phone and feels quite comfortable in my shirt pocket.The screen is bright and clear. It's easy to read even in bright sunlight.Voice quality is great. Much better than most of the phones I've had over the past 13 or so years.I really like Android 4.3. Buying this phone was a switch away from Apple and iOS. I was frustrated by the lack of user customization on iOS and when Apple came out with iOS 7 I was quite displeased with the new display style. So it was time to switch. I very much like the ability to customize this phone. There were things I did like about iOS and I've been able to duplicate them on the S3. But I find the notification features to be far superior to iOS 7, and I have much more control over the phone.The camera is decent but as my main camera is a DSLR I do notice the weaknesses of all smartphone cameras. The camera is certainly good enough to replace my point-and-shoot camera though, and certainly good enough for general snapshots and Facebook uploads.Pros:- User replaceable battery. As long as there are phones with user replaceable batteries I won't buy a phone without this feature.- Light weight- Great screen- Nice large bright display- Good camera for stills- Great camera for video- Bright LED flash for the camera and flashlight use- Good speaker sound and volume- No lack of features including NFC, Bluetooth, WiFi 2.4 and 5GHZ, GPS, and more.- microSD card slot + 16GB of internal storage. I have 48GB of storage.- Standard microUSB cable for charging and data transfer- Huge library of apps available from the store, most that I have downloaded are free- Verizon, while being expensive, has the best coverage.Cons- I wish the earphone jack was on the bottom. With a USB cord plugged into the bottom and the earphones on the top it is a bit unwieldy.- I wish the power button wasn't directly across from the volume rocker. I've turned the phone off or on many times when all I wanted to do was adjust the volume.- I wish the speaker was on the front- Charge time is at least twice as long as my older Apple product- Battery life is about 1/2 that of my older Apple product, but it gets me through the day.- I would like to fit more icons on the home screen, this is one area where iOS is better.- Slippery smooth back demands a case so I can have a secure grip on the phone. This makes it thicker and heavier. (same problem with Apple products. I found the little LG Optimus F3 to have a good grip capability without a case being required)- At night when I go to bed I like to watch the video news podcast. With my wife already asleep I want to turn the brightness down as far as possible but the iPod Touch will go much dimmer than this S3 so I take the iPod rather than the S3 to bed.

After several firmware updates, my town getting verizon 4G, and my own personal use, I can say it is a great phone even though it is now \"obsolete\". (GS4 is already available)  Lets get to the biggest question everyone has about a smartphone: Battery Life.I consider myself a medium level user, I check my email, surf some web content, take pictures, text, and make a couple phone calls each day.  Every now and then a video or listening to music occurs but not daily.  With that being said I am also very particular about background apps and services running so I usually don't allow GPS, Bluetooth, etc to run in the background all day.  Once a day I also go through the app manager and kill certain things that don't need to be run.  With all this I average about 25%-30% of battery life a day.You might think, 'oh that's stupid, I don't want to be so obsessive-compulsive about my phones processes every day' and I agree, I recommend people like that to get a motorola razr maxx hd or an iphone if that is their opinion.  But that is what android was made for, people who want complete control over every process and nuance of their phone so that's why I like it.Now onto the operating system.Touchwiz does add its own flavor to android, and this was my first samsung so I was concerned that I might not like it.  Overall this is what makes me give it 4 stars instead of 5.  It can be annoying sometimes with the cartoon like styling of app icons or senseless animations. But I like other parts of it like the motion contols, to have a reminder when I pick the phone up if I didn't hear it initially.Finally the hardware.I think the phone looks great, a 720p screen is more than enough for me, to think that someone wants a 1080p display on a 4-5\" screen makes me laugh.  Sorry Hawkeye but you're full of it.  Everything looks crisp and vibrant, the processor keeps up (most of the time). What a lot of people don't realize is you need to shut your phone off every few days.  It's not like a computer, it IS a computer, and just like any other computer, the RAM will build up to the point where you have very little RAM left and the computer runs like a snail.  Same thing with this phone, look at it after 3 days on for how much RAM is being used, shut it down and look after its back on, I bet the RAM has gone from 850mb-1000mb down to 500mb.Overall the phone works great, I have great service on 4G, and have (knock on wood) not dropped the phone from more than 2 feet high.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do you really need the Galaxy S4? Maybe not", "Author": "MT", "ReviewID": "R2P9IVALRP2G0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thinking of getting the latest and greatest Galaxy? While the S4 is for sure a fantastic phone, the S3 is still a great one too, and especially now considering the prices have dropped.  From what can be gathered on the internet, the S3 will still be supported with software updates at least through the next Android version 4.2.2 (and maybe further).  However, there is huge third party development community for the S3, so if you root your phone (like I do) then we will probably see further support for this phone with development community updates!  the XDA forums is a great place to start!As far as any new apps that come with the S4, those are already available for rooted(and some non rooted) owners of the S3.The few reasons I can see to choose the S4 over the S3 are:Form factor: The S4 is slightly better form factor (it's thinner with a larger screen), but the S3 feels really good in the hand and my pocket already for such a large phone!Battery life: The S4 has better battery life than a stock S3 battery.  But I have already moved on to aftemarket batteries (see Zero Lemon batteries) for my S3 and have seen improved battery life...Plus I have spare batteries to boot!Speed: The S4 has the latest and greatest quad core processor and 2G of memory, the S3 has a dual core processor and 2GB of memory, so if you are all about speed, then the S4 may be your best bet.  However, I have no issues with the speed of my S3.  It runs all of todays apps with no problems.Cameras:  If this is a huge deal breaker, then the S4 does have a better camera (13MP vs 8MP), but I still don't use my phone as my primary camera anyway.  I have an DSLR for the important stuff!Screen: The S4 is bigger (5\" vs 4.8\") and full HD (1080P vs 720 P).  The S3 is simply not as nice of a screen as the S4...but it's perfectly usable and still looks great to my eye.IR sensor:  Simply put, the S4 has them the S3 does not.  So if using your phone as a TV remote control, or being able to perform tasks without touching the screen are big factors for you, then get the S4.  To me, these sound like cool features I would use once or twice, then probably never again.Additional sensors: The S4 also comes with an array of humidity sensor, thermometer, and a barometric pressure sensor.  Currently, there are not many apps that can use these sensors, but as with anything, there will probably be a lot that spring up in the near future.  It will be interesting to see how these get used beyond basic weather measurements.The IT factor:  If you need to have the latest and greatest, then absolutely, get the S4.  But if you want a great phone, that is fully capable of running all of todays apps and at a great price, you still can't go wrong with the S3!There are tons of these comparisons online, here is one I like.  http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s4-vs-galaxy-s3-202924/", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Still a great phone", "Author": "Agent86", "ReviewID": "R12KBIL2VQLGT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose the GS3 over the GS4 because the price has dropped so much and I am trying to save money.

Ok, yes, it has some idiosyncrasies.  For some reason I can't seem to figure out how to customize the phone screen so that when I choose the phone button it just goes to RECENT CALLS first.  And on my Palm Pre Plus, to delete things, you dragged them to the side of the screen.  On this phone, if you do that in the call list, you call the person (or text them if you drag left).  Awkward!Also, I'd love to be able to pull some of the sounds from the phone for my laptop (When email comes in on the phone, I have this cool Temple Bell sound which I had to go scour the Internet to find for my laptop).  You'll notice that these are really nit-picky things.I LOVE THIS PHONE.Since I was (finally) switching from WebOS (I loved you, Palm.  I HATE you HP.) I tested everything.  I was tempted by the big A, but they've been such bullies lately, I was turned off.  Also, this phone is actually quite a bit better than the iPhone (No wonder Apple is worried).  The other Android phones seemed fairly similar to each other with the exception of the... Motorola, I think, with the slide-out keyboard.  It was tempting (similar, again, to my Palm), but I decided to bite the bullet and go with a virtual keyboard.And this phone... Ahhh.FIRST: This screen is phenomenal.  Some have commented that it's not the brightest when compared to other phones, but who the hell does that every day?  Maybe when you're buying a phone, but after that?  Please.  I keep the brightness at less than half-bright, and it's more than sufficient.  And it's tough as a mother.  I did eventually get a screen protector after about 6 weeks.  I'm still not sure if I needed to.SECOND: Hello!  This girl is FAST.  She jumps between apps like it's Saturday night, and sometimes I think she has more power than my laptop.  I like how the movie/video gallery actually animates the video thumbnails.  It's a little shocking at first, but you get used to it.  It's VERY cool.THREE: This girl is gorgeous.  Just lying on a restaurant table, I see other people hiding their inadequate phones when they see my little piece of hand-candy.  She's sleek and shiny and, though not usually a compliment, this girl is flat as a pancake.  Actually, she's flatter than most pancakes I've had.  She easily slips into my pocket, even with a back case on.FOUR: Surprisingly good battery life.  I'm a Words with Friends addict (forgive me, but it's the only game I play), and it uses an Internet connection almost all day.  If I do some hard-core surfing, I will have to charge in the evening, but usually, one charge overnight sets me up for the whole day.  My Palm had THE. WORST. BATTERY. EVER. This phone is a dream.FIVE: Sometimes the OS (Android ICS) freezes.  Irritating.  I find, though, if I just remember to reset the phone once a week (hold the power button and choose the option in the pop-up), it never freezes up.Did I mention that I LOVE THIS PHONE?I have really played around with this puppy, so if you think you've found something I might like, drop a comment.

With the phone synced to the car via bluetooth, when the phone rings, I hear the ring through the car speaker assigned by the car bluetooth for the phone.  When I press the answer button the call connects but the phone sound does not come through the car phone speaker.  If I disconnect the audio connection, the phone call comes through the car phone speaker.  A call to Samsung tech support revealed that the bluetooth phone audio will not work when the audio plug is accessed for the aux stereo.  I explained that my prior phone an HTC Incredible (version 1) worked perfectly.  I do not believe that samsung has implemented the bluetooth standard correctly.  The standard bluetooth is able to determine if the connection is for phone only or phone and audio.  I know that this phone does have version 4.0 bluetooth.", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can't be more pleased", "Author": "Str8ball", "ReviewID": "R1766K07M54Q0C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned a Droid 2 and Razr Maxx.

Thornton", "ReviewID": "RARS58LH9CO2Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone the week it came out because my Motorola Droid X kept crashing and the sales staff at Verizon said there was nothing they could do with it.  They recommended the Samsung Galaxy S3 as a replacement that would be a huge boost to what I had been using.  I thought I'd try it.  Unfortunately, I took it back after 12 days for a refund.  Here's why:My needs for a phone (these may not be yours, and that's ok)along with how the Samsung stacks up:1. I'm a business traveler and need a phone that can be operated with one hand.  This phone misses.  It's just too big.  I bought a tablet to handle my larger screen needs.  I find that I couldn't reach the top left 25% of the screen when using with one hand.  This phone needs 2 hands.  I think it would appeal to women who just normally use 2 hands with a phone and have a purse to carry the phone in.  My belief is that a phone shouldn't be bigger than 4.2 inches diagonally.  If the iPhone was Android, I love that size.2. I need a good battery life (and a replaceable battery)  The battery life (even with Samsung 'profiles' turned on to help control battery life) did not get me through an entire day.  My Droid X could get me through 1.5 days.  The Samsung has the ability to replace the battery (like the Droid X) but they didn't have any wall chargers that I could take when I travel.  There is no point in having to put the backup battery into the phone to charge it. I'm sure someone will start making a wall charger.  I also found out that Motorola had included a Low Power Sleep mode on their phones but Samsung does not.  this was a great feature when in a situation to conserve battery and keep the phone from searching for a signal (traveling, hotels, etc...) Maybe someone will create a high capacity battery for it.3. I need good GPS  The GPS on this phone would suck the battery down at an unbelievable rate.  I would burn through 40% of the battery using GPS for a 20-30 minute drive.  The Motorola would be about 20%.  I even went for a 20 minute jog and used an app to track my run.  The GPS shouldn't work that much because I'm lucky to run at 7 miles per hour.  I still lost 25% of my battery.  Don't know if it's a combination of 4g and GPS that runs the battery down, but this was my biggest frustration.4. I need to answer email  The Samsung S3 does this well.  The keyboard was really responsive (far better than the motorola droix x).  Was still hard to type / text with one hand vs. 2.  I do like the 'trace' typing but most droid phones have that now.5. I do like social networking and social apps  Samsung's screen is amazing and really does make the apps 'pop'.  If the battery life was better this would be an app users go to phone.*Side note - I do love a phone that takes good pictures and Samsung S3 does this really well and fast.  Video was great too!  I was floored how good the pics/video was.  But like everything else on the phone, it requires a battery that lasts.My family went to the zoo for 4 hours with the little kids and the phone's battery ran out (even with the screen set to the dimmest setting).The salespersons suggestion when I brought the phone back was to buy an external battery pack and just plug that in.

The 2 gig of system memory combined with 16 gig of storage plus the 32 gig I added as expansion provides tons of room for apps and data. The fast processor makes all operations smooth with virtually no lag even while running multiple apps. The large display is bright and shows vibrant colors; watching movies or reading ebooks is a real pleasure.

It may not be the latest iteration from Samsung, but the price and performance makes this phone a real bargain.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Could have been so much better...", "Author": "Ferdinand", "ReviewID": "RWHLNUFTB2G9U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The S3 has incredible specs, multitasking is (mostly) a breeze, and it runs pretty much any game I throw at it. Physically, my only complaint is the awkward button placement. Admittedly, a year ago a hardware menu button was still usable, but the back button is on the wrong side, making it awkward to go back and forth between this and my Nexus 7. Putting an actual home button instead of a capacitive one is a move that screams Apple copycat, and also is annoying. Lots of times, just mashing the back button is easier than pushing the home button.On a positive side, the screen is gorgeous. I have small hands, and yeah, it does get a bit difficult to use the big screen sometimes, but I'm certainly not going back to a screen any smaller than this. Reading web pages is a dream on this. The screen is also AMOLED, which means almost-unrealistic but beautiful color saturation and power-saving with black pixels. The phone's back is slick glossy plastic, so using it without a case would be slippery suicide. Speaking of cases, the Galaxy line is the only phone line that can remotely compete with iPhones in terms of case ecosystem. The power and volume buttons are cheap feeling, yes, but solid and easy to find. The removable back is handy- while I don't carry an extra battery, I like the idea of being able to. With the 4.3 update, you can move some apps to SD cards- without, you can only put pictures and media.The software is what kills this phone. Anyone who appreciates the mundane, slick sci-fi interface of ICS won't like Touchwiz. It substitutes the cool blues and blacks with tacky, bright greens and cyans. Yes, with some work, some of the ugliness can be hidden (Alternate launchers and other apps), but some stuff, like the archaic notifications shade, can't be ignored. Even if you genuinely do like Touchwiz's look, it still slows down the phone. Apps like Google Music and Twitter that normally work smoother on my S3 than N7 will trip up and force close far more often on the S3.Software updates. They exist, lagging behind the Nexus line because of Touchwiz, and lagging behind the other S3s because of Verizon (but that's not Samsung's fault). I'm running 4.3 on mine, and it will likely get KitKat sometime. Touchwiz strikes again, ruining lock screen widgets and still being a chore to deal with. You can customize the notification toggles now, but can't put them entirely in two separate shades like on stock android. Lock Screen Widgets, the standout feature of 4.2, are effectively useless since you can't use them with a security lock. Honestly Samsung, without a security lock it's just easier to, you know, open the app?I've blasted Touchwiz too much. It has one- one!- good feature that's making my N7 jealous. That is multi-windowing. You can check Twitter while watching a YouTube video, or have Chrome and Officesuite open while writing an essay. These are all stretches to do on a 4.7 inch screen, and would feel more at home on a tablet (which, by the way, Samsung makes), but I'd be lying if I said I hadn't done it. It isn't practical, it doesn't work with every app, but it's darn cool.In short, who is this phone for? Not someone looking for the latest and greatest, since I'm writing this review more than a year after this phone was made. On the budget spectrum, this undeniably beats out the Mini-phones spawned by HTC and Samsung, but unless you're fond of Touchwiz (yikes) or of physical buttons, the Nexus 5 or even 4 are better choices, unless you really need extra batteries, or an SD card, or all the cute cases the Nexuses don't have. The Nexus 5 and 4 aren't on Verizon, though, so this makes a good bargain purchase for that carrier.The elephant in the room- is this better than an iPhone? Me, the Android nerd, says of course, but if you're already tied to iTunes, get a 4s or 5c. To a budget Android fan stuck on Verizon, unless you *really* need the SD card, go with the Moto X.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I needed!", "Author": "B. T.

That said, it is also a bit slippery to hold because of the smooth plastic on the back of the phone, so I generally keep mine in a case.  Even with a case, this is still a slim phone, easy to hold and easy to type on, even with my relatively small hands.  Software wise, I like what Samsung has done with their Touch Wiz user interface.  It is easy to use and customize, and there are more features built-in then most people are likely to ever use.  The camera takes great pictures and video, and streaming video on the phone's screen looks excellent.  Call quality on Verizon in Southern California has been very good (the only reason I have stuck with them as a carrier is because of the reliability of their network).  Data speeds are fast both with WiFi and 4G.  The only real complaint I have about this phone is the battery life.  I know it has a very large screen and that the 4G service is real drain on the battery, but I was hoping I wouldn't have to charge this up every night.  It definitely makes in through a day without any problems, even with reasonably heavy use, but I've never been able to take it for two whole days without having to charge it up on day 2.  Still, with a user replaceable battery, you could always keep a spare on hand and switch between the two if need be.  Overall, I really like this phone.

I think the stylus was a waste of money, though. I will probably buy the docking station. Couldn't beat the price on amazon.com. I wish the icons were nicer, but I'm finding out \"there's an app for that\" so at least I know I can change them if I'd like.

Why?1. I couldn't make it more than 8 hours without charging it. This was in spite of turning off the wifi, GPS, and Bluetooth when possible. My wife's Iphone 5 and my new RAZR M have far, far superior battery lives, as in days.2. Call reception and quality were not equal to the Iphone 5 or the RAZR M from the same locations. (My house has 2-bar 3G and 1-bar 4G.)3. Wifi reception, connectivity, and throughput were inferior to the Iphone 5 RAZR M from the same locations. Using the Speedtest.net app, I get 16Mbps down at my house on the RAZR M and Iphone 5, less than 10 on the Galaxy.4. You can't operate these large phones very easily with one hand, as in while driving. The smaller Iphone5 and RAZR M don't suffer this problem. In addition, the larger phones are not comfortable in a shirt pocket due to their size.Other considerations on why I chose the RAZR M instead:The RAZRs have the same 1.5 GHz processor as the Sammy, but only 1GB of RAM instead of the Sammy's 2GB. I run a lot of apps and didn't notice any difference in performance. Tests show the Iphone 5 to be the fastest on the market right now, but I honestly don't see any difference in performance between my wife's Iphone 5 and either the Sammy or the RAZR M.At 960x540, the screen resolution on the RAZR M isn't as good as the Sammy's 1280 x 720 or the Iphone's 1136 x 640, but I don't watch videos on my phone and didn't really notice the difference. If you really need a big screen, go for the new Motorola Droid RAZR HD and HD MAXX. These have the Sammy's big screen, but with the rest of the features of the RAZR and RAZR M, including the outstanding battery life.For you world travelers, the new RAZRs are global-ready, like the Iphone5...buy a SIM card when you get to the new country and replace the Verizon one. Not true for the Sammy.You might think the 8GB max. internal storage of the RAZR M might be a problem...especially since, as with the Sammy, you can't offload apps to the microSD card. Surprise! I have a LOT of apps. I loaded them all and they only took less than 1GB of internal storage, so it wasn't really a limitation after all. In addition, you can still put all your photos, videos, etc. on the SD card on the RAZRs.Best of all the RAZR M is $150 cheaper than the Galaxy S3 or the Iphone 5.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Now that I've used this phone for a couple of months", "Author": "Jean Blanchfield \"jeanib99\"", "ReviewID": "RMRSGIETG22P6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about a month or so ago and have a very different perspective.

Google wallet lets you pay for things with your cell phone (Just swipe your phone across the pad like a credit card) a major feature one of the reasons I bought the phone. Nowhere on the description for this phone did they mention that. Having an annoying WIFI popup blocking out the screen every time I want to go on the web. I also have issues with poor 3g and 4g signals much worse than my old Samsung Charge. I received an update and it made 3g even worse, this is yet another software problem. I have a friend with a Sprint Galaxy S3 and he has none of these issues, the other day I look over at him and he is online, meanwhile I fight with a wifi popup and then find out I don't even have a signal? it's the same phone for goodness sake. I have phone envy and its the same phone. LOLThis the same phone as Sprint AT&T; and T Mobile but Verizon changed the software crippling it's potential and ruining an otherwise good phone. Just about every single app I download for it that is listed to work on the Galaxy S3 doesn't. I have contacted three of the developers (people who wrote the apps) and they all told me the Verizon version of this phone is nothing but a head ache for developers its software is a nightmare. I have had to Factory reset my phone four times because of these incompatibility reasons. I contacted Verizon and they told me the software is different because of security reasons???? and that using software like the other companies use (Sprint AT&T; and T Mobile) will diminish the Android experience! Being able to use half the apps that the other phones have and having your phone lock up on half of the ones you are told you can down load....what an experience nice work Verizon. If you really want this phone don't get the Verizon version you will regret it I certainly do.  Verizon was just told by the FCC that its practice of charging people for Tethering is now illegal.  Shadey business practices, I wish I could have all that money I had to pay for tethering back since what they were doing was wrong enough to now be illegal.I'd like to add this comment to my review because I think it clears up why I rated it the way I did.  It was in reference to a review that chastised other reviewers for giving bad reviews to the phone because of Verizons modifications.\"In all fairness this is a review specific to the Verizon model not the entire Galaxy S3 line. You cannot judge a phone on hardware or software alone but how the two work together and the experience this Synergy provides. I have had the opportunity to use both a Sprint and a T-Mobile version and the difference is immediately noticeable, the phones startup much faster, the opening verizon screen is the most tacky sickenly bright annoying loud stratup screen to date for one. The other phones mentioned are both tasteful and lightning fast in getting to the home screen from the phone being off Verizon models are slow to get to the home screen and then blind you with a bright white screen with tacky red purple lime green circles and an annoying bell sound. I'm embarrassed and do my best not to start my phone up in a quiet public place .....Lol My friend with a T-Mobile S3 ribs me everytime I start my phone up and calls it the \"Neuralyzer\" after the mind eraser that Will Smith uses in Men in Black. Every time I start it up in a dim area it lights up my face like a flashlight sets off a string of alloying bell sounds takes forever to get to the home screen..... and my friends just start chuckling.......... The lack of Google wallet ...I still have yet to have anyone able to explain why this Verizon doesn't allow you to use it? When they comment on my review they never seem to touch on this glaring short coming. Who are they to say what app I can or can't use? It is my phone right? Wifi popup drives me nuts, the other phones do not have this, why would Verizon add an extra unnecessary step that has to be repeated every time you want to use an operation that uses 3 or 4g? There are countless apps that have all varients of the Galaxy S3 listed but not the Verizon model (now that hackers have found a way around Verizons modifications of the phones software it has changed a bit but you have to hack your phone to get to the point all other Galaxy S3's are straight from the box?) I'm just scratching the surface here, bottom line the Galaxy S3 is an awesome phone and if you can hack the software you are golden but this is a reveiw for the Verizon model and it is different from all the other models and not in a good way hence the poor reviews.\"Did you know about these problems?

Still in order to differentiate its products from other Android device makers; Samsung is skinning it's products with Touchwiz UI. This is a bloat, and though in some cases makes usage easier, in most cases it causes stutters and lags. With the beefed up hardware power, it gets smoother than older devices. But still not as smooth as say an iPhone or Nexus. I had come to expect this from almost all Android devices, until I installed pure vanilla android with a custom ROM. It's so buttery smooth and gives so much better and enjoyable experience to the user. I highly recommend using CyanogenMod 10.1 or Supernexus ROMs. Any high end Android device would be so much better with pure vanilla Android.But all in all, it's a great phone.

I am seeing complaints on the Verizon network and issues about where the buttons are placed on the phone.....seriously? When I was ready to make a purchase for a new phone the available options were the Galaxy, One X, and Iphone, but the battery life, screen size, and 2GB of ram is what led me to this phone.I am coming from the Samsung Epic 4G which I disliked after 30 days so my first goal to achieve when receiving this phone was to find a reason to return the phone before the 30 day trial period. So I tried to get the phone to freeze, I simultaneously started updating and downloading my apps from my old phone, started opening apps, played YouTube video's, sending and receiving text messages, played with the camera, streamed movies from Netflix. I left all the apps open during this testing time and the phone did not freeze it just got really hot and lagged a little bit when sending the text messages but that was all.

There is never any lag to be found, whether you're swiping through home screens or playing the latest games. The camera quality is excellent and takes pictures much faster than previous phones I've owned. I've always been rather impressed with the battery for the most part, as it lasts a full day easily. Things aren't all perfect, however. Within a few days of owning my first S3 I began experiencing a \"No Sim\" error. This would cause the current text I was attempting to send, or the phone call I was trying to make, to fail. The issue only happened once or twice a day at first, so I ignored it, thinking it was simply a fluke or a tower issue. A few days later I continued having it, and decided to exchange my phone for another S3. Within several hours of firing up my second S3 I began having the same problem. I had my SIM card swapped out, thinking it could possibly be a bad SIM card, but still, no cigar. It has been roughly two weeks since I swapped phones, and I am now having the problem several times a day. The issue only happens when you attempt to send a text or call, making it especially frustrating, as it interrupts whatever you are doing.

In many areas where my previous phone had a good signal, this phone had none. I spoke with my cell phone service carrier and was told that they were aware of this problem with Galaxy S3 phones and that Samsung was working on a software update that would fix it. I strongly suspect that this is, in fact, a hardware problem that is not going to be cured by a software update.If indeed it is a hardware problem, it is seems highly unlikely that Samsung will admit it and fix it given how many phones of this model have already been sold. Instead, all they have to do is delay for a couple of years because most buyers will have acquired another phone by then under their carrier's update programs.In short, this seems to be yet another case of an electronics manufacturer using the consumer to do its beta testing or themselves doing abbreviated beta testing so that they could rush this phone to market. If you are thinking of buying this phone, I suggest that you test it immediately at locations you commonly frequent to be sure that it performs to your satisfaction.

If I charge the phone over night and don't use it at all I will be at 78% by 11am.  I have been in to Verizon multiple times and all they want to do is have me buy an $80 emergency charger.  Sorry Verizon, I just paid $200 plus insurance and extended my contract for another two years with you giving you over $3600 of my hard earned money and you want to charge me $80 for a charger.  No Thanks!  AND....  This phone doesn't even let me make calls.  It continually drops calls before the other party answers.  No rhyme or reason to this.  It happens at home and away from home and I do not live out in the boonies either.  Words can not express my disappointment in this phone.  I had my first one replaced in less than a week because it wasn't updating and locking up 3-4 times a day and I had to remove the battery to get it to restart.  After hours on the tech support line with Verizon they told me just to go back to the store and get a replacement.  Thankfully my replacement doesn't lock up but the battery life and inability to make outgoing calls make this phone completely useless.

After many discussions with the carrier and Nissan Bluetooth Engineering group it was confirmed that the version 4.1.1 is not compatible with the Altima Hybrid Navigation hands free system.  Nissan has tested the version 4.0.3 successfully which is the earlier version of the software. Weather anyone can still purchase the 4.0.3 version is questionable.  We have moved on to the Galaxy Note II (oddly using the 4.1.1) which does pare with the Nissan Altima navigation system.

Also it's hard to enjoy the 4g speed because it eats data like CRAZY and verizon just took away the unlimited data plans unlike Sprint. Think twice before you go with verizon because like I said, it's hard to enjoy the phone. Sprint's Stock price has been flying ever since verizon cut the unlimited data plan (check it out) because I believe people are switching to Sprint instead. You will really start to feel the verizon pinch. The phone itself is awesome, great camera, screen. quick ui.
