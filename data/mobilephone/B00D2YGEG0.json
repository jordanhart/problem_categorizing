It is surprisingly good and is Windows 8, not 7.5/7.8  Similar in specs to the Lumia 625Reliable and just works; it does everything I need it to do.  Good quality phone calls and good quality pics.  Tho if you are looking for a hardware powerhouse this is not the phone for you (could use more RAM and Storage)", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't buy until they fix the storage issue", "Author": "lkh51981", "ReviewID": "R1933F2E4FDYY6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have only one complaint with this phone, but its a big one. It has been giving me a message almost since day one that the internal storage is full. At first it was just an annoyance, but it has reached the point where I can do nothing on the phone without deleting something. I can rarely ever take videos or pictures, I even had to delete 3 apps just to send a text this morning. Adding an SD card will do nothing. Even with everything stored on the SD card that can be (basically only pictures and music) and only a couple of basic apps installed it has only one Kb of free space. After extensive Googling it seems this is because of how the phone allocates any \"free\" space to its built in apps, which can't be uninstalled. From the number of complaints I have found the manufacturer must be aware of this, but as yet there is no fix. Until there is this phone is a waste of money.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "No service", "Author": "christopher", "ReviewID": "R399T4OU1BJZFS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Couldn't get service anywere other than that decent phone.
