For some reason, I can't view images saved to the memory card (although I can play music from it).  I called Samsung, and was told that they don't support phones that aren't \"manufactured in the US.\"  Come on, nobody manufactures cell phones in the US!  They refused to offer my any support or hints on where I could get support, other than \"search the internet.\"  I had searched the net, and found many issues regarding Samsung phones and SD memory cards.The documentation is missing information on several of the phone's features.  If you're in the market for an unlocked phone, then you're probably technical enough to figure the features out on your own, but if not, sorry, no help from Samsung.", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "3 and a half but.....okay very well 4 stars", "Author": "roz79", "ReviewID": "RJI56F8UOBD0W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really might give it three and a half stars.The thing is my preference is not slider phones,I like clamshells.But I got such a great deal on this phone from my provider that I thought that it was worth a go. (Plus the clamshell version of this phone -the u300 had no Fm radio which is kind of a deal breaker for me).Anyway it is a super sleek, super sexy phone and I never thought of calling a phone sexy before this one). It reall has a nice design. Also I never used Samsung phone. I am a die hard ericsson fan, and was actually gonna get one till like I said I had a great offer.I found that it was very easy to navigate, I was able to find things easily, I LOVE the -ugo- wallpaper. (It does this cool thing of changing depending on the country or city- I think- you are in.) That is totally cool and cute. Camera is pretty good, just battery life is advertised as like 3 30 H of talk time. But I work all-nighters sometimes and I had this baby running for like a 30 hour stint (with intermittent calls) and the battery only complained after that. So I guess it depends.Nice slider action.Now the problem with it the MAJOR problem, 'touch sensitive keys'. Wow! A potentially cool idea but recipe for disaster. I had been warned online about it dialing numbers accidentally so I was wary. It does it mostly when the phone is opened (and therfore unlocked) and if you re fiddling around with other stuff it may just dial out and if you don't realise majorly embarrasing.And there is no haptic feedback which lets you know that you pressed the button so you gotta be careful. That is why I did not keep mine, re-sold it exactly a week after purchase cause I realised that the samsung d900i is like exactly the same phone with out the touch sensitive keys....(it is slightly wider by less than 2mmand slightly fatter by 2mm) but there is less chance of accidental dialing and it still looks slim, trim, ultra sexy and cool.So yes it is a pretty great phone BUT if you think those keys are gonna nag you or make ya regret them go for the d900i OR if you want a better upgrade the g600 which is also the same style but with a 5MP camera (slightly wider phone too).So good luck", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung U600, the slimmest slider phone ever.", "Author": "Nashat Mostafa \"Consumer Electronics Consulta...", "ReviewID": "RBNP0YSRDHTJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung U600 is an impressive slim slider cell phone which is a member of the Samsung Ultra Edition II range.
