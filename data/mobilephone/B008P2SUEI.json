{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung Entro is perfect if you just need a phone.", "Author": "Jared72886", "ReviewID": "R1TI665GR7PHMP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Samsung Entro today and I love it. The phone is extremely basic but I knew this when I ordered it. $15 for a brand new phone is incredible and I am also using the $20 a month plan currently. I wanted just a basic phone for now where I could just be able to use it as a watch, an alarm clock, and just simply for calls and emergencies. I work in a warehouse where I have computer access, and I have a laptop as well that I can use for anything else. Again, if you just need a phone this is an amazing deal and Virgin Mobile service has always been great for me. I would highly recommend this phone to someone who just wants a phone for a phone. The screen is bright and clear, the speakerphone is extremely loud, and the battery life is very good. There is still some people out there who aren't glued to their phone all day and don't have an obsession and I am one of them. And I am 26 by the way. The $20 a month plan will cost me roughly $240 a year in cell phone service which is a no brainer. Sure the Verzion iphone 5 users who pay $80+ a month will be laughing at my flip phone but hey I will be laughing at the $720+ a year I am saving in bills.

I don't do texting, and when I surf, it's on my PC. (My eyes can't appreciate the small screens on cell phones...it's a strain.) This is easy to program and comes with all the basics.

It is extremely basic, and I was a little disappointed at the lack of certain features. This phone actually wound up being a downgrade from the one she already had. Biggest points of disappointment:1: There's no bluetooth, so I had to manually go in and re-enter each and every one of the contacts.2: There is no way to change the font size, which is pretty small. (Inconvenient for my grandma.)That being said, it does what it's supposed to: makes calls, stores contacts. But if you want to do more than that, you'll be highly disappointed.

I had an iPhone before, so this phone took a bit of getting used to. This phone is a great phone for people who want a basic phone- there is no camera or any other fancy extras you might find on a more expensive phone-  and a tough phone- I accidentally dropped it several times and it still works. I loved the speaker phone on it. It's almost as good as my old iPhone's. The battery is great too. I'd charge it every 2-3 days. The only problem I had with this phone was texting. The keys on it are not made for people to send a lot of texts on.

You can't buy more ringtones or graphics from Virgin Mobile for this phone. The phone numbers on the inside screen are displayed in tiny digits impossible to read in dim light. Its calculator is basic like something designed twenty years ago.Yet, I am delighted with this phone. Why?First of all, the cost of the phone is extremely low and even two dollars lower when I bought it from Virgin Mobile. Call quality is more than adequate while the speaker feature is loud and robust. Using the speaker, I can lay the phone on my lap while driving and have a hands free phone conversation.This phone even has a voice activation feature. I can press one button, say call home, and the phone dials home for me and any other number than's programmed into my contacts. For anyone who's not glued to his or her phone and likes to carry a just-in-case cell phone. This is the one. Right now I have the $20 dollar a month plan with 400 minutes.

It's simple, affordable, and just does what a phone should do. Basic communication. Being an ex-smartphone user for almost four years, it's very nice not having the internet tethered to me, 24/7. The plans are at a great, affordable price ($30 for 1500 minutes and 1500 texts) and this phone is covered by Sprint's nationwide cellular network making voice communication excellent in my area. The battery almost triples from what I've gotten with my smartphones, making me charge this phone three times total within the last month. The speakerphone is surprisingly loud and clear and the overall build quality rivals those of a $45 dollar basic phone.

Mostly, it's perfect for her needs, which is to say it's a phone with good clear audio quality, decent battery life, a ringer that can be turned up pretty loud, and keypad buttons that, while not huge, are big enough for her to see. It'd be less than a 5-star purchase for someone who wanted to text a lot (or ever), since a no-contract slider isn't too much more expensive -- but if you're looking to minimize complications (i.e. technical S.O.S. calls from an older relative/friend), and you want something you feel confident won't die unexpectedly because of insufficient battery life, this is a great choice.

The upfront costs is less than what you would pay for a typical smartphone data plan in one month.Changing my phone number from VZ to Virgin Mobile was very easy.  When you get the phone, the instructions tell you to log on to Virgin Mobile and register your phone.  Then you get the option to use the phone number attach to the phone or transport a phone number you already have to the Virgin Mobile phone (make sure you are completely out of your contract with your old provider before doing so or you will get hit with an early termination fee).  Once you follow the instructions exactly and choose a plan (lowest is $20/mo for 400 anytime minutes and $0.15 per text received and next lowest is $30 for 1500 anytime minutes, 1500 txt messages and 30MB for web surfing), then you just pay as you go.Do the math:  Using my old phone plan, $75/mo for one year comes to $900/yr.

I believe that they are the only carrier using it. I got it to replace an iPhone because AT&T;'s least expensive plan was nearly $70 per month. Virgin Mobile's least expensive plan is $20/Month (plus $2.05 in tax and service charges). That does not include TXT messages or Web browsing, neither of which I would use this device for. I also wanted a cell phone that did NOT include a camera (something that is hard to find).Documentation:The book that comes with the phone weighs almost as much or more than the phone. One would think that would indicate a good manual. It does not. Half the manual is foreign language (Spanish I think). It has 20 Pages on the operation of the phone and another 30 pages to satisfy Samsung's lawyers. While it does include a short description of most of the phone functions. Embedded in the instructions there are \"graphic\" images of some of the buttons. These are extremely small and difficult to read (break out the magnifying glass). The manual does NOT include a clear glossary of the ICONs used on the phone. To be fair there is an tiny abbreviated icon glossary hidden under the \"Phone Information\" on the phone.Voice:Incoming calls are excellent and those speaking to me respond that their side of the conversation is clear. There is a problem with the speaker phone. The incoming conversation breaks up so badly it is next to useless. I have used the phone with a wired headset and in this mode the phone is excellent. The biggest short coming is the lack of bluetooth. This is a major oversight as the primary purpose is voice calls.Voice-Activated Commands:The voice system is easy to get into and it appears to work, however I do not use it.Camera:It does not have one. For me this is a great advantage as there are a number of places where someone can not carry a device that includes a camera. If I want a camera I have several real cameras to choose from. I do not need a bad camera in my phone.Texting:Well it does it but with the small screen and the lack of an full keyboard it does not do it well.WEB:I use a 24 inch monitor at home. I am not even going to try browsing the internet on this tiny screen or without a real keyboard.Computer Connection:You can connect device this to your computer with a third party cable. It will charge but it will also generate an error: \"MTP USB Device not properly installed, Device driver software was not successfully installed\". Samsung's responce was to contact my computer manufacturer. I guess that Samsung expect HP/DELL to provide device drivers for their phones.Date/Time:I stopped wearing a watch years ago after I got my first cell phone. The external display will show the current time in large characters any time you press the vol rocker. Below this is smaller characters is the day and date (moth, day). The phone also has an alarm built in but I have not used it.Battery Life:It is supposed to have about twenty days of up time. I do not know because I have not yet seen it come off of full charge. Of course I plug it in at least once or twice a week. It will \"beep\" when it is fully charged.Keyboard:It has large keys clear keys with back lighting so it can be used in the dark.

I bought this phone as a \"home phone\" and could not be happier for the price, it literally sits in the main entryway of the house and is barely used, it allows me to put in all of my contacts and assign ring tones and pictures if I want. There's no camera, there's almost no ringtones or backgrounds available to purchase for this phone, and I wouldn't count on it to do anything other than make phone calls. It gets great reception, it seems sturdy, and if you're not using it a whole lot (like me) then the battery seems to last forever. If you just need a home phone or a secondary phone where you can be reached, this is a great phone for that. At 20$ a month for very basic service, it's much cheaper than most of the landlines, and you don't get the telemarketer calls on it that you get from landline phones. This would be a great phone to give to your child if you need to be able to reach them, or if you need them to be able to reach you, since you don't have to worry about what they'll see on the internet, youtube, or anything else they can get into with new smartphones.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Duke says", "Author": "Richard W.

After I got this phone, its flaw became an annoyance where I changed the phone.What I wanted:  Alarm will ring monday through friday and will turn off when I push the side button.  Alarm will not repeat.Flaw:  This phone comes with a snooze.  When snooze function is disabled (I don't need repeated rings), and stop the alarm with the side button, the alarm setting changes from \"mon-fri repeat\" to \"once\".  In effect, the alarm turns off, permanently.  I have to reprogram the alarm setting.If I able the snooze, the \"mon-fri\" setting is remembered, but I have to take the phone out of the holster, open the phone and dismiss the alarm.  Often, while I'm handling the phone, side button will be pushed, then the \"dismiss\" function is gone.  The snooze can be turned off only if side button is not used and dismissed from an open phone.

This was due to the fact that this phone is cheaper than a new battery, which was probably the first warning sign that it was a bad idea. Not to be confused with the other Samsung handset of the same name, this is the new ultra-low end handset in the Virgin Mobile PayLo lineup. The PayLo plans and phones are meant for those who really just make calls, and this thing only does that. It's an okay emergency phone and is super cheap. It has good battery life and is obviously quite tough. However, there's a reason it can be sold for such a low price: this is essentially a 8 year old Samsung basic handset on a new production run.Feature-wise, this handset has nothing. I really mean nothing. You can make calls, have an alarm clock, and store a (limited) number of contacts. It's so weak that the web browser now shows 'Insufficient memory to run browser' whenever it tries to launch- even just to check balance or top up! And no, there's nothing installed on the handset... not like you could put anything worthwhile on it to begin with. This is also one of the few phones available anywhere that doesn't even have a VGA camera and has a 128x160 screen. Lastly, you would think it'd at least be small but it isn't! It is quite light and not that tall or wide, but it's fat. Really fat- fatter than the old Samsung Mantra and LG Flare that VM used to sell (the latter of which was a better device, and it's hilarious I'm saying that about a rock-bottom 5 year old handset in comparison to a 'new' one). This thing will make your pocket bulge for sure.Unfortunately, the Entro is the only clamshell available now under PayLo. However, if you can at all stand a bar I strongly recommend any of the other devices in the lineup. Seriously, they're not THAT much more expensive and you get what you pay for... the Entro costs close to nothing and you really get nothing.Pros:CheapCons:FatNo features at allCan't even check balance or top up", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "No bluetooth", "Author": "Bernie", "ReviewID": "R1YNCSHNGE3U2E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone does not have Bluetooth and that fact is not stated in the product description.
