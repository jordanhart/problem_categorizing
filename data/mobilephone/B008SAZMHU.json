{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Really a 4.5. 5 for waterproof phone, 4 for a nomral phone.", "Author": "Adrian", "ReviewID": "RUM6HJ1H0Q1TD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been looking for a waterproof mobile phone for a long time. I even bought one made for use in the Japanese market, but had to give it up because it's features were so dumbed down for outside Japan, that it wouldn't receive signal outside the country I bought it in I'm in Asia). So when Sony came out with the Acro, a waterproof phone which wasn't tiny (I can't type on screens smaller than 4 inches) and wasn't slow as a dog (not mentioning Motorola's attempts at waterproof mobiles), I decided to give it a try. I chose white because it looks better than black, and I have this fear that if I drop it in the pool or ocean, it'll be eaier to see when trying to catch it before it disappears from sight.So far, it's not perfect, but overall it's useable. Let's work out the pros and cons:The Good:---------- looks good.- well spec'd- good processor and latest Android OS.- Generally good phone- clarity of both listening and speaking and it's external speaker are more than acceptable.- 12mp camera with good easy to get at features, such as white balance- Comes with charging dock included. It's attractive, but I suspect more importantly, it reduces how often yo have to open the USB/charger socket at the top of the phone- thus it will not lose it's seal as quickly.- Has a LCD light on the front of the phone to notify you if you've received messages, etc- decent battery life. I know some reviewers on the black acro have been bitching about bad battery life. Well let me tell you, I think it's just fine. I used a Sony Ericsson Acr S before the Acro, and it's battery would be down to 15% after just 6 hours using msg apps only, like whatsapp. In contrast, I took the Acro kayaking and took 100 photos and 4 x 20 sec videos, and the usual whatsapp messages, and the battery was still 50% after 7 hours of this. What are you comparing it to? a DSLR with attached optional battery grip??? If you truly want a phone with long long long lasting battery, get a Philips- they have mobile phones which can last several weeks on a single charge- no joke.- and speaking of kayaking- did I mention it's waterproof? Forget testing it in the shower or dunking it in a glass of water- I full on used it while kayaking 8km along the coast, and dunking it at the beach to show off to my fellow kayakers who were amazed!The Not so Good:----------------- It's too sensitive. I'd have my camera on and somehow sometimes I'd find several extra photos taken as I just held the phone. Sometimes I'd find the camera mode changed from still to video too. Need to be careful- The top of the screen shows icons of apps being used or messages received eg by whatsapp, sms, gmail, etc. However, they are all only in grey. In the Arc S, they were all different colours, so it was easy to see what app had received a message. Now you have to squint more to see the tiny icon shape.- The bottom of the phone has three touchbuttons. The middle one is for going back to main screen. Unfortunately, it's too close to the space bar on the keyboard. So far, I've accidentally hit that over a dozen times while typing and gone back to the main screen. Bit annoying.- Perhaps I dont know how to use it, but the dim screen feature doesn't seem to work- it actually makes the screen go brighter! To me, the make the screen dimmer button (swipe to see on left from middle screen) should make it dimmer, right? But no.- taking screenshots is awkward- you have to hold down the on/off switch and the lower part of the volume switch simultaneously.- This is a minor thing, but it's a bit too symmetrical for me. I often take it out of my bag upside down because there are no obviously physically distinguishing sides, unlike the Arc S.Overall, should you buy this phone?If you want a waterproof phone, then definitely yes!If you are looking for a normal touchscreen phone, then it's defintely worth a look! It has decent features, is well made and has good holdability, good speakers, battery life and is attractive.If you've made it to the end, then thanks for reading!Update 2013 May 19th-------------------- - internet upload and download speed is good. Was fast when it came out, still comparable with current releases - still waterproof, but when I take it in the shower to type, sometimes it's not as precise as when I first bought the phone - The phone has frozen several times now. (seems to know exactly when I need to use it the most to choose when freeze) Thanks to googling the problem, I've found I can unfreeze it by pressing on/off button and the \"up\" part of the volume button at the same time. I'm happy to have discovered this because you can't get access to the battery and remove and reinsert, which was my previous fixit technique for such problems. - Despite the gradually increasingly unreliable software, I still like the phone and use it with no intentioon of replacing it. I've wanted a physically rugged phone for quite a while and I'm sticking with it. Sony has brought out 2 new waterproof phones now, so maybe the Acro can be had at a better price :)", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "loving it with a huge (.) PERIOD!!!!", "Author": "Joey", "ReviewID": "R23TH6AB9995XD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I lost my Arc S, good thing I was able to save enough money when this product came out. I even tricked a few people when they see me sinking this on an aquarium, which they gave an \"is this person insane?\" look. The product really is water proof!!! & I just clean the screen with any cloth, and it leaves no scratch marks whatsoever (thus far). The camera does a good job even when it's being captured at night time even when it is pitch dark. I just adore this phone and the countless things which i can do with it (with the help of the google play apps), the processor's fast... way fast, and even faster than my Sony Tablet S when playing heavy-duty videos with a huge chunk of filesize. I will be keeping this phone for years, and I couldn't ask for anything else.

I like how it came with a pre installed screen protecter(shine it up to the light and you'll spot it on the screens edge. i put an additional screen protector on just for safety). runs very smooth while handeling multiple apps, awesome 3d animated wallpapers and smart looking minimul theme. the android app store is great. The phone is also very beautiful and recieves damn good phone signal.HOWEVER I really wanted to put up a review because a lot of people were complaining about not getting 3g on this for att. Heres how you do it(as i am streaming hq music using the Music Unlimeted app by sony with my acro s using 3g)GO TO menu/settings/more.../mobile network settings/access point names/ now hit the bottom right tab/new apn....NOW fill in these blanksName: can be anythingAPN: wap.cingularProxy: leave blankPort: leave blankUsername:WAP@CINGULARGPRS.COMPassword:CINGULAR1Server: leave blankMMSC: [...]MMS Proxy: wireless.cingular.comMMS Port: 80MCC:310MNC:410APN Type: leave blankyou should get an H by your signal within a minute. the H means you have 3 g. enjoy your acro s <3UPDATE June 6, 2013Just to update this, for everyone who doesnt know how to configure the phone since it is unlocked, go to google and type \"apn settings (your phone carriers name here)\" and it will tell you all the stuff to put into it. You can use my steps i showed here to get to the cofiguration if the website you searched for didn't tell you how to do so. I'm saying this because in my previous comment, under MMSC, amazon.com automaticly made it say [...], I didn't put that there they did, i actually typed data there for you guys to read but the websites not letting it happen.So yeah, again, google \"apn settings (your phone carriers name here)\" and you will find out how to make it work. THIS PHONE DOES GET 3G AND 4G FOR ATT AND TMOBILE from what I have personally experienced with my acro s using the tips ive given you just now, which do work.

Whether you prefer android, or don't care for which smartphone Operating system you use; this is a very user friendly experience.Sony doesn't do much at all to alter the Google intended interface or features of the Android operating system. They do add a few nice features with the Xperia models to simplify or 'pretty up\" some preexisting features.- I tested the water proofing thoroughly. The IP55 and IP57 standards that this claims to meet are definitely on spec.- The screen is beyond what I imagined in terms of clarity and vibrancy. Samsung can claim all they want with their AMOLED screens, but the fact is they remain cartoon-y, over-contrasted, and apart from reality. Sony has done an amazing job with this device; the glass over the screen does a great job at deflecting stray light, so that even when the screen is dim, it is 100% visible in bright sunlight. The iphone 5's screen is amazing but does not hold a candle to the Acro S.- The Acro S feels very comfortable in hand, quite light but not too much, and has a great use of screen to front real-estate; as to not waste space.- The matte finish on the body(I purchased white) is great for avoiding scratches and other such marks.- The camera is actually very responsive for its level of features. In low light situations with no flash, the camera will obviously have to crank up the ISO to grab more light faster, but the rear(primary) camera does a great job at handling the noise. The front camera will show a good amount of noise in these situations, but really, why are you using the front camera for pictures you want done right?-The charging dock is a great concept and execution. I will be ordering more from amazon. To those that try to use a micro USB charging cable they already own, with the dock and are unable to charge, the solution is simple. The dock requires 5 volts(standard USB voltage) and 1.5 amps. Most common micro USB chargers provide much less amperage and can charge the phone directly, but will not with with the dock.- The battery life is comparable to most phones in its class, at work for a day with signal issues pulling on my battery life and the average use of camera, messaging, and searches, and having wifi on. I can make it a 10hour work day leaving with above 50% battery._ _I bought this to use on T-Mobile USA, and at the time of writing this(January 7th, 2013) I am only able to use 2G with this network, until the roll-out of the re-farmed network reaches my area for 3G. I have no complaints as I use wifi most places. The 2G is more than enough for checking traffic on Google maps, quick Google/Wikipedia/IMDB searches, and I am fully able to send/receive picture messages without delay. Android will automatically set up all the ports and settings for you when you put your SIM card in for whatever network you choose and go to \"Mobile Networks\" in  the settings., and if not the internet or local store for your network should help you(T-Mobile does).", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressive Hardware; Phone OS Not So Much", "Author": "Jamil Taylor", "ReviewID": "R3VEBP1MSBO26V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The is my second world unlocked phone.  My first was a Nokia N900 that was a no-brainer for setup over T-Mobile in the USA (just plug in the SIM card and you're good to go).  The Sony Arco S, on the other hand, requires the user to enter network settings for data access.  While the spoken conversations will work by simply plugging in a SIM card, you must enter network specific APN settings for the phone to have any Internet access. So, I deduct points for phone setup.I switched from T-Mobile to AT&T; when I purchased this phone.  Note that although this phone lists 3G as a feature, it is not 3G compatible with AT&T;'s wireless network.  I had this same issue with my Nokia N900.  3G works over the t-Mobile network, but it does not on AT&T.;  Also, be warned that you will not get setup help from AT&T; for this phone.  I walked into two of their core stores where the sales person contacted second level support for help.  After hours on the phone with them, the setup of my phone was a failure.  I was able to resolve the setup issue within ten minutes of Google searching when I got home (try searching for \"AT&T; APN settings Xperia\").  The fastest speed over the AT&T; wireless network shown for my phone is:  EDGE:2As I write this review, the T-Mobile wireless network is extremely poor in my area.  Even though my Arco S only gets a 2G connection with AT&T;, everything (and I mean everything) is so much faster due to the much improved network when compared to T-Mobile.  Please note this this paragraph and the previous one is not specific to the Arco S (my rating of the phone is not due to network provider compatibility or issues).  I have added this information to aid those who use this phone in the USA.For reasons unknown to me, simple things that I wish to set on this phone are done in a not so user friendly way.  As an example, I wanted to set an MP3 file as my ring tone.  I copied a few MP3s under the Music folder on the internal storage but could not figure out how to set one as a ring tone.  I tried Google searching where I found results stating to simply play the file followed by selecting a menu option to set as ring tone.  No such menu option exists on the Arco S though.  It turned out that I have to copy all audio files to the ringtone folder for them to show as a ring tone option.  I am not sure why I have to copy the same music file in two different places.  Hence, a usability rating decrease due to this.I do like the hardware of the phone.

Talk about believing in your own product!!! Wow. False advertising much?Why do most people buy waterproof phones? Because they're afraid of being pushed into a pool or being sloshed in a hottub and doing something weird.

Why?*It's one-second sleep-to-photo/video function takes more like 10 seconds.* The phone is extremely glitchy - will randomly shut down when it feels like it.* The touch screen messes up when you plug it into a power source* it's very slow overall - apps, showing photos/videos to your friends.
