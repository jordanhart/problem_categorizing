Well, there are plenty of functionality issues.  It took me a few hours to read around and get the phone to function as it should have out the box.  To break it down, I will list the problem and tell you what I had to do to fix it. 1. Android 2.2 was horrible - Upgraded to 2.3 through LG Mobile Support Tool on LG website 2.  Wifi would not connect at all - Downloaded FXR WiFi fix and rescue App, 3. GPS did not find any satellites - Downloaded GpsFix(paid version)App, free version has invasive adds.  4. Since I use Simple Mobile the APN would jump back to T-Mobile settings - Downloaded APN Manager to delete T-Mobile APN.The first and last ones are on me.  Yet, Wifi & GPS is a must for any phone that is supposed to be smart. 5 stars if I didn't have to do anything. 4 would make people think it was a preference issue versus hardware issues.  3 is what I got out of the box, plus had to pay for an app to make it function properly.  After all the issues being fixed it is a 4.5 phone.**BATTERY LIFE IS GARBAGE!** - Downloaded Green Power PREMIUM (Free app is too limited to see results), took me two days to adjust it perfectly.

In its original incarnation, the phone had a lot of software and hardware issues.  The software update that came out in early August was a spectacular improvement.  It transformed the phone from an annoyance into something that is really a pleasure to use. T-Mobile took this phone off the market for a while over the summer, and I think the time was spent on tightening up quality issues.

I'm on my second one already (ended up going through 4) because of all the problems it has. I've done everything the manufacturer and T-Mobile has asked me to (upgrade to Gingerbread and full reset) and I'm still experiencing all the same problems.What problems am I referring to? The phone has a MAJOR known issue that most G2X owners experience and that is the fact that the phone completely shuts itself down (yes even with a full battery) sometimes it will reboot itself, but most of the time it does not. You may be on an important phone call such as a doctor or a business client and the thing will just shut off. Boot up is slow so to return a phone call that has dropped from a shutoff takes awhile.The dual core processor and the 4G network drains the battery super fast, so if you own one it's best to turn on the function that runs the phone on 2G.Another problem I've experienced is the LCD freezes up if I'm on an extensive phone call which makes multitasking impossible (especially conference calls) and the only way to end the phone call is for the other caller to hang up and then take the battery out and reboot the phone again.The operating system has its own issues. Many of the preinstalled apps will \"Force Close\" and cannot be accessed at all until you again turn the phone off, take the battery out, and then reboot the phone again.LG continues to insist they are working on these known issues, but the phone was released in MAY! Almost 6 months later and still not fixed? Shame on LG for releasing such garbage before these major bugs were fixed. T-Mobile refuses to give me a handset from a different manufacturer (except the Sidekick which I do not want) since it is a manufacturer issue. They all keep giving me the same response (the manufacturer is currently working on the known issues)", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cool, cool phone.. BUT...", "Author": "Jonas Lear \"Jackal\"", "ReviewID": "RZAZQ28I0VS80", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided to write this review from a 14 year history technical standpoint.This is an awesome phone, it has and does just about everything you would want a smartphone to do. However, there are some things about it that can really get on a person's nerves. I at first however thought it was a flaw with the actual phone, so I sent it in for a new one of the same kind and have the exact same issues. So, the cons are with the phones actual design and I believe I have come up with ways to help make working this phone easier.Pros:- LONG battery life, you can multitask the **** out of this phone and the battery lasts forever.- Does just about anything: videos, audio, advanced apps, access to the Market, etc.- Apps work GREAT on this.. the visuals are amazing along with the sound. However, don't download the \"Advanced Task Killer\" that will do bad things to this phone.- Wireless is great.. love the wireless (sometimes.. see the con about it below).Cons:- Shuts off periodically for several reasons: updating, overheating, freezing, etc.FIX - shut the phone off periodically a couple times a day and reboot it. It will also greatly help if you make holes in the back of the casing, it will help the phone breath because it does run hot. I just took a box cutter to the back casing and cut out small long rectangular holes.- Flip screen does not always workFIX - again, shut the phone down and reboot it periodically.. using this fix will almost always solve the problems.- Wireless does not always work correctly.. meaning you'll be attached to a network signal, you'll get in your car and drive 10 miles and you'll still be attached to it and it messes with your signal.FIX - disable the wireless and turn it back on or reboot it.- Touch screen does not always work with \"official numbers\". Meaning if your phone has been on for quite a while and you call a number where you have to enter in your social security number and things like that, you will press the correct button but for some reason it doesn't send the correct numbers.FIX - for this you have to reboot it.Please don't get me wrong, there are many more pros than cons to this phone, but.. some of these cons can really piss you off at the wrong times. This is an awesome phone, I recommend it to all my friends that have T-Mobile. I do honestly believe though if you make it to where the phone can breathe more easily, it will eliminate about half your issues with it, because that's what I did with the new one I got and it shuts off has as much now.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "FINALLY a great phone", "Author": "Mister B", "ReviewID": "R2LJ45V0RXE6MA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The T-Mobile G2x (or in other countries, the LG Optimus 2x) has kind of a troubled history.  It launched with FroYo (in spring 2011, no less, which is pretty crummy) and it wasn't exactly a solid phone.  Lots of trouble reported around the web with lock-ups and freezes and random rebooting and so on and so on.  I don't doubt any of that stuff.I got this phone right after 2.3.3 released last summer.  It wasn't exactly stellar, but it was good enough. I experienced a very rare random reboot and very occasional lock-up.  Super rare, and not necessarily an indicator of the software.  Still, reports of that behavior abound on the internet with the 2.3.3 Gingerbread update.And then in April, LG/T-Mobile released a 2.3.4 update.  And wowza.  Totally solid phone.  In the 2 months since the update, I have never experienced a crash.  I don't believe I had any random reboots, though I guess it might have done it in the middle of the night.  Never once during the day when I was using it or needed it.  I'm finally really impressed.  So let's quit talking about software and get to hardware.The screen is the first thing you'll notice, and it's gorgeous.  4\", 800x480 resolution, IPS display.  IPS is one of the higher-quality LCD technologies out there, with very wide viewing angles, accurate color reproduction, and bright backlights.  It has all of that.  The screen, in fact, is what sold me on this phone in the first place. The body is sturdy and solid-feeling, as well.  The screen is covered in glass, there's a metalic trim on the sides, and a soft-touch rubberized plastic battery door.  The volume/power buttons are solid and tactile, and pressing them is easy without being out of control.  It has 2 cameras, one front-facing (which is good enough for skype) and a really nice 8MP camera on the back with LED flash.  Pictures are great, you know, for a phone.  It replaced my Nikon point-and-shoot 8MP camera since the photos are basically the same to my eyes, but if you want dSLR quality, get a dSLR.  Duh, it's a phone.After that is the engine running this ship, an nVidia Tegra 2 SoC and 512MB of RAM.  The Tegra 2 is as fast as any other 1GHz dual-core CPU, and the ultra-low-voltage GeForce GPU is quite sufficient for all your gaming wants and needs.  Where it falls a little short is the 512MB of RAM.  Occasionally if an app runs wild, the phone will sputter.  Zynga's games are the worst offenders I've found; Words and Scramble both use around 40MB when they're idle.  Totally unacceptable, honestly, and because they dont' get along with the phone I removed them.  If the phone had 768MB of RAM (like the MyTouch 4G and MyTouch 4G Slide) it'd be a different story, or if it had 1GB like the Motorola Atrix (the other Tegra 2 phone that came out in early 2011) it'd be a total non-issue.  512MB of RAM is plenty most of the time, though.The phone has 8GB of storage total, with 1.45GB partitioned off for app storage (which is plenty), 3.7GB set aside as the \"SD Card\" (internal storage), and the rest eaten up by Android's system, cache, and boot partitions.  So 5.25GB of space available to the user, and a micro SD slot that supports micro SDHC cards, so you can have another 32GB of space if you so choose.  My phone came with an 8GB SD card for a total of 16GB of storage, but if you buy used I would not count on getting that bonus.Call clarity is great.  The speaker gets relatively loud before it distorts.  I can hear people well, they can hear me well, and that's either using the handset or the speaker phone.  It has Bluetooth but i have not used it.  It also has micro-HDMI output for playing videos or games on your TV, and the phone came with a cable, but I have not made use of it yet.The phone has been discontinued but it's well worth getting. Finally.  The only way you're going to get nicer off-contract is to spend twice as much money on a MyTouch 4G Slide, or even more on a Galaxy S II or HTC One series phone.  I can't say enough.  I'm using it with the $30/month Monthly 4G pre-paid plan (I don't need more than 100 cell phone minutes, but I want the data coverage and Android OS).  Cell network speeds in my area are fast enough - this gets the same bandwidth in the same places as my wife's LG Optimus T, which varies anywhere from 6.8mbit to next-to-nothing out in the middle of nowhere.  Dropped calls are a non-issue with the phone. Reception si as good as my old phone (a cheapy java phone) or my wife's phone.I think that covers it.  It gets an unqualified thumbs-up from me as of mid-April 2012.  Previously it might have been a little hesitant, but I'm glad I've stuck with it.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "This phone is a beast but may not be appropriate for basic users", "Author": "Teccho", "ReviewID": "R1I0HJYO97BS7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for less than 3 months. Many reviews underrate this phone. If you know how to follow basic instructions and root it, this phone is simply unbeatable especially if you can get it at around $300 w/o contract. When you factor in the price, I give it a five star for the value.I installed CM7, reception is greatly enhanced. Reliable and fast. I have not experienced any of the problems of most users. I did get a few freezes when I had over 90 applications and multiple widgets. After a factory reset, I scaled back number of apps and widgets and the phone works great.

I only had 2 weeks to swap it if I needed to, so as soon as I got home, I began HEAVY usage of the phone. I did experience a few of the known issues (random reboots & frozen screen), so I took it in to exchange for another one. On the second phone I got on 10/21, I have not experienced any problems what so ever! The phone is absolutely amazing! It sounds to me that with this phone, its kind of the luck of the draw? Or quite possibly, operator error? I am a bit of a tech geek and I love to push my devices to the limits. In the 3 weeks that I have been using this phone, I have rooted it and tried several different custom ROMS & Kernels. Like the previous review said, rooting phones is not for everyone. However, I am willing to bet that my G2x is faster than 98% of smart phones on the market today. I have put this phone through EXTREMELY HEAVY use and overloaded it many times and it continues to live up to every challenge I throw at it. My fiance also got the G2x on our upgrade. She has not experienced any of the problems and did not have to exchange it for a new one. Her first phone is running stock and operates beautifully. I also have a friend with this phone, he was experiencing all of the same issues. He rooted the phone and put a custom ROM on it, and ALL of the issues disappeared. So my suggestion to any consumer looking into buying this phone is this. I highly recommend the phone to anyone. You will enjoy it MUCH MUCH more if you are tech savvy and will be rooting the device. Use it as much as possible within the 1st 2 weeks so you can find any issues and exchange or return it before the 2 weeks is up. I absolutely love this phone and I think most anyone with a hint of technical common sense would too!", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal Phone!!!!!!", "Author": "RP", "ReviewID": "R35Y30JD27X774", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone was delivered on time, Brand new with new packaging, good Seller (The Wireless Circle). Will buy the same phone from the same seller again.The phone is a DUAL CORE phone (two chips), so EVERYTHING is processed faster. I have had a Quad Core computer for almost four years, and it still beats everything out there, so having more chips speeds up anything. 2012 will be the year of Dual Core phones, so this was slightly ahead of its time/future competitors. I chose this over a Nexus S and a Galaxy S II (all three unlocked) because this phone will do 98% of what those two phones will do at about 60% of the price!!! Great value for your budget.Tip: Get an unlimited data plan for this phone (from your phone carrier). It will soak up anything (data-wise) you can throw at it...already downloaded 400 megs in a day and a half of initial usage! And not one lockup or slowdown! Came with Android 2.3.3, so very happy with the software side of things...Battery: Get a bigger battery folks..this phone uses up battery power like you won't believe (on the standard battery). When you open the box, CHARGE it first for a few hours (overnight?), only then use it..then let the battery discharge all the way down to ZERO before you recharge it again...apparently these batteries need to be fully charged and fully discharged (the first 5-10 times) before they will accomplish their full range. The bigger battery (had to buy it seperately) charged up fine in the car from the cig lighter (3 hours). Turn the GPS off to save battery power. Already has a battery app on board, so you don't need another battery app.Phone: VERY easy to use, big large buttons. Hangup button is red (center button on screen) or you can configure the Power button to be the hangup button. MAKE SURE you turn OFF the mobile hotspot button otherwise you will be burning through your data plan. It defaults to ON when the phone turns on the first time (at least in mine).Texting: Easy to use buttons (on screen)..although the one complaint i have (andriod software) is that it constantly corrects names or words it doesn't recognise..you have to press the word that is all the way on the left side to let the word stay in the sentence/text (the one you just typed). On the other hand, it DOES suggest words as you are typing, so you don't always have to type the whole word.Internet/Data: You will be addicted to the speed of this phone! Enjoy!!!User Manual (in box). Good pictures etc, but i found the online manual MUCH more informative.Overall: GREAT PHONE for the price. Equals or beats most of the high dollar whiz bang phones out on the market now (Jan 2012) at about 60% of the price. Will be buying the 2nd one shortly (same seller).", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone with some big problems", "Author": "Exquisite Intelligence", "ReviewID": "R3BIXYKIAS9247", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I first got this phone, it would constantly shut down on me and I would be forced to take out the battery.  I thought that the Gingerbread update would fix everything for me, but the phone still has some issues.  Sometimes when you press power to wake up the phone (when it isn't shut down) it will be unwilling to show you the screen.  The fixed icons at the bottom will light up, but it won't work.  Only be holding down the power button and shutting the phone off and then restarting fixes this.  It also seems to happen at the most inconvenient times.  Another issue is that after the Gingerbread update, the phone has issues with the proximity sensor during phone calls.  Normally the proximity sensor shuts the screen off when you hold the phone to your face so you don't accidentally press keys with your face.  When you move the phone away it should show the screen again.  Quite regularly it just won't show the screen again after you move the phone away from your face. Normally you can press the power button to show the screen (while your call is in progress) but sometimes even that doesn't work and you need to manually restart the phone.  Another HUGE issue I have noticed after the Gingerbread update is that the GPS basically doesn't work anymore.  I pretty much can't use Navigation period.  Also the camera app after Gingerbread has gone WAY downhill. I seriously wish I had never upgraded to Gingerbread.  Do yourself a favor and get a phone that isn't made by LG and also stay away from any Tegra based phones since they won't release their drivers for their A2DP stack.

When I first set it up, it worked fine but then after some time it just couldn't reach any servers, despite Wifi being connected. After playing around with it a bit, I found a solution by disabling the mobile data connection (not sure if this is truly necessary) and configuring the Wifi settings using a static IP and manually setting the default gateway, subnet mask and DNS. It seems that when using DHCP over Wifi, the G2x doesn't use the router assigned DNS and therefore cannot connect to any servers unless you type in the actual IP address. I don't know if this is because of a software bug or if it's my, admittedly cheap, router's fault. Something to keep in mind if you have this particular issue.As far as the other problems I've read about, I haven't experienced any of them. No light bleed from the screen and no random reboots. I read somewhere that Cyanogenmod actually fixes the reboot problem on affected phones so that might be something to try if you are having that issue.Overall I am very happy with the G2x.

Also if you can't shut it off all night, shut it down for 5 - 10 minutes int the mornning.  Other than that the phone is awesome!!!  lightning fast!

I bought this phone for my wife when it was brand new from T-Mobile. It has been nothing but a headache since about 3 weeks after we got the phone. I bought my wife another phone and took the G2X once the issues began.I won't overwhelm this review with technical issues, but I will highlight the main ones. Also you most know that I had full coverage on the phone and both T-Mobile and LG are slugs when it comes to customer service.1. LG had issues with the battery running hot which caused phone issues. I had to send the phone  back to LG twice and it still over heats occasionally.2. Phone powers off at random times and freezes every few days. This requires a full battery pull to  restart the device.3. The phone also has horrible reception. I live one town over from T-Mobile's US headquarters and  you would think I'd have the best service, but no =(.4. Sent the phone back to T-Mobile and they finally admitted the phone was a flop.  In return I got a new LG G2x with the same issues but a few more days between freezes.5. Upgrades to the operating system come slow if at all. LG knows they screwed up the programing  on what should be an awesome Google phone. So in return they concentrate on their other newer  devices.I have had nothing but problems with this phone and will never by a LG product again! I'm not normally like that this but LG's customer service is horrible. As for my relationship with T-Mobile, I'll be leaving them in September when my contract is up.

This phone is out-classed by it's other dual core, HD competitors.This high-end device is stuck on Android 2.2 (Froyo) in spite of never ending claims that it will get 2.3 (Gingerbread).I purchased this phone 2 weeks ago and I'm already on my 3rd device because of the screen bleeding light and device rebooting. If it weren't for these two issues, this would be a wonderful smartphone. ...but then, if I had wings I could fly.To T-Mobile's credit, instead of giving customer's a hard time, the company acknowledge the issue and willingly & swiftly replaces the faulty units whilst taking up the quality issues with LG. T-Mobile is handling this issue in a timely, fair & professional manner.If you seek a dual core HD device from T-Mobile, I suggest you go for HTC's Sensation 4G. Do a side-by-side comparison on gsmarena. It has a bigger screen with more pixels (qHd). It shoots 1080p at 30fps, instead of G2X's 24fps. It comes with Android 2.3. It has 250 more mb of RAM.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Shame on you Amazon", "Author": "Chika Udechukwu", "ReviewID": "R1H3K4J2V8XO6R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I chose to buy this phone from Amazon because I thought i would get the best if I spend my money on something I like, that was why one can not rate a purchased product immediately after you purchase it, no wait for some weeks, i purchased this phone from Amazon but it was not a new phone but when i found out, it was late, and i was so desperate to have or replace my phone back, there was no manual book, the little book i found gave direction on how to download the manual online, the battery was a replaced one and you could tell the edges can not cover really good because it was over the size of the phone, the charger was a replacement charger it is not working till today, i became so angry when the nuts at the back cover started falling out, the most painful thing was that, i went to switch to another phone company, they told me my phone is not unlocked phone.

It's a very cool phone, with a nice display, and a nice screen. I've dropped it a few times, and the screen is still perfect, even though there's a dent on one of the sides.I upgraded this to Cyanogenmod 7.0, which is Android 2.3.7, and it solved most of the issues. I think this is one of the original phones with a lot of issues, since I bought it used, and I've had it for months. Even though most of the issues are fixed, there are two issues still. #1: My phone will shut off if I leave it charging for a long time. This is really bad for me, since I use my phone as my alarm clock. So, I just always charge it before I go to bed in case it freezes. #2: The wireless and the GPS will stop working sometimes (usually only every 2-3 days, and they'll both stop working at the same time.) A reboot fixes this, but it is a little annoying.Note that the description says 3-D. It's not a 3D screen. It's just capable of rendering 3D graphics, which I think all smartphones are. This one just does it really well.My verdict: If you can get a great price on this used, then snatch it up. If you're buying a new phone, then get something else.Pros:+Lots of memory+Very fast, it runs every application that I threw at it+Good camera+Nice screen+Near indestructibleCons:-A bunch of random stuff that doesn't work the way it should. I think I'm one of the lucky ones that only had two things go wrong with it, so buy at your own risk!-If you get it from T-Mobile, it has a bunch of software that slows your phone that you'll want to uninstall. But that can be tricky, because it's locked from uninstall.-Even though it's high end, you get better performance if you uninstall most of the applications", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT!!!

Btw screw the contract bulsh*t. The phone is great honestly had never had any issues with it however there are a few drawbacks with it being that it is definitely aging. Such as there arent anymore updates for it I think, and stuck with 2.3.4 Gingerbread. Unless of course you root it and all that jazz which I did do to my phone but decided not to install any roms to get Ice Cream Sandwich or even Jelly Bean, which Im not even sure if this phone is able to get those upgrades. Before I rooted my G2x I did have a few problems with the phone freezing up and needing to take out the battery to reboot. MAYBE it could have fixed itself if I had given it time? I dont know but something like that is definitely irritating but not anything worth spitting on the phone over.Coming from a Droid I really miss having the LED notification light blinking and telling me I have a text or missed call. Sadly this phone (among so many others) dont have that function. Ohwell...Everything else Id say is very good as far as battery life: dont abuse apps and screen brightness and I get over 15 hours with normal usage.Screen brightness is very good. Call quality no complaints. People have said that speakers arent working properly or that only one is working... basically on the bottom of the phone, there is only one speaker and the other is the microphone. I can say that id like to see the loudness be a little better with the speaker such as with playing music, but that can be just my phone im not sure.Honestly I can sit here and type everything about this phone since ive had it forever but im not going to. Ive had no regrets with it and dont see myself having another phone for quite sometime. The poor souls who talk crap about it must have gotten a lemon in the first place.Rooting it is going to come in handy with this phone as well and can do many other things. The rooting process for this phone is very simple you should have no issues with doing it yourself.Also after rooting it, so far I have not had any issues with the phone freezing or needing to reboot it. And am sure other minor bugs can be fixed with doing this as well. Of course with this phone, there is so many apps that are garbage that you can do without. So once rooting, get rid of them and save up space on the device and save battery life and performance overall. Overall, Love my phone!

I had the LG google G2X for almost 5 months, and I do not recommend it for several reasons:1- The camera is not good enough as I expect from 8 MP camera (the 5 MP on the Galaxy is much better), although the video camera is not bad if the light was enough.2- After you dial the number and get connected, it is very hard to dial an extention number because the touch sreen kind of freezes even though I tried to change the settings not do so. The technology behind that is for you not to dial more number by accident by touching the screen. If you are dialing international number using a phone card that will be very frustrating sometimes. I contacted the seller from the biggining but he wanted to charge me a lot of return fees and shipping fees, so I kept the phone and I thought may be I will learn how to deal with it. I would like to mention that I am very comfortable dealing with the new gadgets and technologies.3- Does not support a lot of languages at least to read web pages on the net ( for example I can't read an email was written in Arabic or an arabic web page on facebook).4- A little bit heavy comparing to others. But maybe feels sturdy.5- If you buy from amazon.com the best thing to do is to buy items are sold by Amazon only. Their return polocy is excellent especially if you are Prime member. A lot of other sellers have shipping time much longer, and the return polocies will push you to change your mind to return it because it will cost you a lot, just like what happened to me with the seller Wissamelectric which I will never buy from him again. He tried to discourage me not to send the phone back by putting all these fees.Of course the phone has a lot of good features as smart phone but all listed in the description.

Don't know where to start.  It lags too much.  Slow as hell.  Slow when synching your car.  Slow when skipping tracks via the steering wheel controls.  You have to power cycle it on average once a day to get reasonable speed.  Apps will force close a lot especially the ones with regular use.  Sometimes when U call someone the screen fades to black after it dials the number.  You can't hang up cuz the screens black.  Calls drop regularly.  You have to take the battery out and put it back in bc it freezes too often. It shuts off on its own.  Those positive reviews are probably real salesmen or people who've had them for a week.
