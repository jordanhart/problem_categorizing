Even putting a 32gb sd card didn't help. It only has 128mb on the phone. Also the old phone had such a small screen that some things got cut off. Enough about my old phone. This new phone, this Sony phone, is great. Although does have some minor things that might get on my nerves. The main issue is that when you send texts and I automatically get a reply about message being relayed. Which was not an issue on the old phone but when doing a google on it. I found some black berries also having that issue with the same phone service that I have. it sounds like that is not something you can change at least nothing I can find says how to change that. I don't mind it being relayed I just don't want to be notified. Another issue is email notifications do not always work. I mean email works it just does not always seem to notify you. The gmail notifications do work. I did a google on that one as well and actually found some one talking about sony xperia but not this one, an older one. I am not sure which one he was talking about but he had this same issue and could not find a fix for it. He also suggested getting the Samsung Galaxy S3. I would get one of those but they are a lot more money then this phone.Any way I do like this phone even with the minor issues listed above. Oh wait I just remembered another issue that is not a major one either. This new phone does not work with my FM transmitter. I have no idea why either as it uses a standard head phone jack to connect to the phone. Any way again I do like the phone and I like that things are not cut off and I am not longer running out of room on the phone.Update to this review. I now give it 3 stars instead of 4. Main reason. Some times it will lock up and you have to remove the battery as none of the buttons work to get it to come back on correctly. It is a pain to remove the battery as well. Another issue is when the phone restarts either after pulling the battery or just restarting it. The phone comes back on and starts making random sounds. This is not my rington nor does it stop after a while. The first time it did this the thing made random sounds for almost an hour. I was on the other phone so could not pull my attention to trying to get it to stop instead I just covered it until I was off the other phone. I can stop it by swiping from the top to the bottom and hitting clear even if there is nothing to clear. This stops it. I have yet to figure out what causes this or why.", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "buggy", "Author": "G.

Responds well to your finger tips.1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM7227A processor. This is the latest processor from Qualcomm and designed to deliver the highest-quality mobile video, imaging and graphics experiences at Ultra HD resolution and at the same time conserve your battery. I thought the processing speed of opening the apps was pretty good.-Timescape UI-Scratch Resistant-512MB RAM ( Decent power to run all your applications)-4GB internal storage, up to 32GB expandable memory with microSD and this is amazing storage.-3.2-megapixel rear camera. Its not an amazing resolution camera, but the images were decent.-1530 mAh battery. Which is quite a decent battery-Free Headset (for limited period of time)Cons::-Resolution of the screen is not that great. On a scale of 1-10 its at 6 and Apple iphone being at 9 and HTC one phone at 10-No front camera and the existing camera of 3.2 MP will not get you amazing clarity pictures, if you are a big selfie.-No flashFor Gaming::It can play casual games like angry birds, temple run, temple run 2, subway surfer etc. without any lag. It can also play high end games like dead trigger, gta 3, etc. but it will skip few frames(means its ill be a bit laggy).Conclusion::Decent phone for a great price.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bought two: one worked, other failed, Sony refused to repair it", "Author": "RS232 port", "ReviewID": "RGOE0VBGBRCOK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off: it's cheap, unlocked, and runs something newer than Android 2.3. (4.1 to be exact) However, it's slow, text doesn't look sharp at all, and you don't want to use it for much. The camera is nearly worthless. It's OK if you have some patience and need something basic and unlocked, but I suggest spending the extra for a Moto G instead. I've occasionally had to pull the battery upon it freezing or going berserk, though that's not very often. (Note: on at least one of them, I need a flathead screwdriver to pull the battery if I want to avoid ruining my finger nails. This isn't the case with other phones I've dealt with.)Now for the problem. My family bought two of these, one a few weeks after the other. One of them has been working fine, used for checking email, making calls, and texting. The other developed a bad spot on the touchscreen ~6 months in - like a big long spot near the right side of the onscreen keyboard. You can't type certain letters because of it, and it happens that you need to swipe through that spot to accept a call. (If I do it just right, it'll skip through that part and unlock.) So, I contacted Sony about the warranty. First, they told me to run their software to fix it and wipe the software. (Yeah, like that'll work.) That didn't fix it, no surprises there. (Plus, the software doesn't run on OS X 10.9 and consistently threw an error on Windows 8.1 after I'd installed it and gotten through half the process - I had to use Win7.) So, I had to call them back, get an RMA, and pay to ship it to them. They sent it back a few weeks later claiming that the microUSB port had damage that was customer abuse, and that they hadn't tried to fix anything. (There was a small bit of missing plastic in it, and I don't know how it happened - it belongs to another family member - but all the pins were there and it still worked fine.) The USB port has absolutely nothing doing with the screen issue. The screen wasn't cracked or anything, no visible damage/abuse whatsoever.Congrats Sony, you just lost a customer and earned a negative review.

I tested data speed while tethering this phone to a PC and it clocks at 3.6mbs. That is almost the same as my Samsung 4G that cost 4 times more.  The Bluetooth works much better than other phones I have had with great sound through my car stereo.

I've had the Xperia E for several months now, and in retrospect I should have paid-up for more memory and processing power. This is a classic example of \"you get what you pay for.\" The phone can be infuriatingly slow to respond, even to actions as seemingly simple as unlocking the screen with a PIN. The screen resolution is too low for some apps, making them difficult to use. The camera is only good for capturing still subjects in daylight.By far the most annoying feature of this phone is its small internal flash memory. 2GB seemed like it would be enough when I was shopping, since I had no intention of loading a bunch of media on it. Little did I know that only about 750MB is allocated to so-called \"phone memory,\" which is where most apps are stored. This severely limits my ability to install much beyond than the preloaded apps on the phone. Some apps can be moved to \"internal storage,\" and I have managed to uninstall / un-update some of the preloaded apps. Nevertheless, updating large apps such as Chrome is often a tedious process of clearing caches and temporarily uninstalling other apps in order to free enough storage perform the update.

I opted to turn off data and simply use wifi for all of my internet needs. The only problem I had upon unboxing it was figuring out how to get the battery cover off, as the instructions are mostly just pictures and not very descriptive - I figured out that what you do is simply put your thumbs above the little speaker on the back and push up.If you don't ask a lot of your phone then I definitely recommend this. People who are used to more powerful, more expensive phones might be a little disappointed. But for me this phone does everything I need to and more. I previously had a phone that ran Android 2.2 and really wanted a phone that would support my credit union's app which allows me to take pictures of checks to deposit them (otherwise I have to drive 2+ hours) and this phone does that perfectly, even with the low-grade camera.I love the \"swiping\" option with the keyboard, I find it to be much easier to text that way, especially if I need to text with one hand. (No, not while driving). The one issue I have with the phone is that texting the regular way is a little bit annoying, it doesn't seem to be able to keep up with my typing speed and sometimes will give me more letters than I asked for. (\"Sunday\" would turn out to be \"Suunndaay\" or something like that), I wish it had the same Android keyboard that was on my last phone. I did download a secondary keyboard app and that seemed to make a difference.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice phone", "Author": "Sergio", "ReviewID": "REDDYC07R14VN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the sony Xperia is a practical and modern phone. i like it because have a perfect size and wide. i recomended it", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "xperia", "Author": "vidya sagar barija", "ReviewID": "R38B8VUV6MZFKG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Phone not working properly very disappointed and dejected Also have many problems with the phone not behaving as a standard sony product", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "good price for the product", "Author": "Jos\u00e9 Ure\u00f1a Guevara", "ReviewID": "R1V5T992WX1CVN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No complain so far. the mobile is pretty good with a good resolution.
