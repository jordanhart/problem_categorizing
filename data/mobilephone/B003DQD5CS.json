He contacted me last night after seeing my negative feedback. He at firstoffered me a replacement phone of a lesser model if I would retract statement. I responded that I wanted a comparable phone. He then agreed to so so and I was satisfied. Then he wanted me to retract statement immediately. I responded that once my daughter received phone in working order I would be happy to edit review. He then responded that now he  will give me a $25.00 refund (paid $100.00 for phone) I said that I wanted  a phone. He then went on and wrote his review.  Not only did Cass waste my time he obviously was only interested in me retracting my negative review and never planned on sending me another phone or partial refund.This has to be a fly by night company STAY AWAY!  As my previous review stated my daughter ordered a phone after 2 weeks phone was not holding charge She never told me until after 30 days of  receiving phone. After much ado Cass  credited account $3.00 for new battery Phone is not holding charge, dialing people randomly, now not working at all. My daughter is away at school and needs a phone that works.

However, at the release of this device the Android platform was still growing and functioned in a much less advanced capacity than it currently does.  Through several updates of core firmware, as well as various software updates to apps, the phone has become sluggish and often unresponsive.Long story short, the hardware hasn't kept up with the every-growing demands on the software front.  The Android Marketplace offers a great breadth of content that is simply impractical to run on this outdated hardware.  If you're looking to have a phone that keeps up with current technological trends, think twice before investing in this sucker.Also, battery life tends to become absolutely abysmal after the first 6-8 months or so, so definitely think about investing in some backup batteries.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Other than Keypad Issues, this is an Outstanding Phone", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R1AAH5AFW4PPXJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, and most importantly, this phone works well as a phone.  It gets better service than does anyone else's phone I've compared it too, even the newer DroidX.  The speakers are both loud and clear and people rarely claim to have a hard time hearing me (sometimes going down the highway in my '96 diesel pickup, but that's to be expected.)  It's easy to answer calls.  It's a little frustrating to make calls sometimes, because when you tap on the \"phone\" icon, you don't always get the keypad (sometimes you get recent calls, favorites, or contacts).It's incredibly durable.  It's taken a three foot fall onto asphalt, an almost five foot fall onto tile, and numerous falls from a shirt pocket when I bent over (the dangers of switching from a Velcro flapped pocket to an open pocket).The hard keyboard is too flat to easily feel the individual keys.  The top row is too close to the screen making it difficult to depress the keys on the top row.  The keys lack a truly positive tactile response.  It's fatiguing to reach the middle of the keyboard with my right thumbs due to the four-way rocker button placement on the right side of the keyboard.  In my opinion, they would have done better to place the four-way in the middle of the keypad, separating the keys at the middle.  The virtual keyboard is too cramped for me to easily use, although I can use it with word correction (I have no trouble using the virtual keyboard on the DroidX).  I have small to medium hands for a man.I've had the phone almost two years and the display does not seem to be as bright as it once was.  When I first got the phone it was a bit of a challenge to see the display in full sunlight, now it's pretty much impossible to see.  The battery life is still excellent.

The salesman at Verizon told me he sees a lot of this with this phone. The problem I have now is that there is no warranty and I am not up for my 2 year upgrade- so Now I will have to buy another phone full price. I plan on buying an unlocked phone with a warranty and taking my business elsewhere in 6 months. No $400 should fall apart like this this quickly. And Verizon should be doing something about this.

Again, it was two a.m. and one of those calls was to my grandfather, another to my next door neighbor, my aunt, family on the east coast (5am there) and a few other random people I should have deleted from my contact list years ago.

Droids tend to be heavy users of batteries but the battery in this phone was made in August 2009, so it is almost two and a half years old on delivery.

The Motorola DROID (A855) is the newest and most advanced phone on the market right now, and this bad boy does an awful lot. A lot of people are going to compare this phone to the iPhone, but the DROID trumps the iPhone in features, and freedom. I will discuss, first, the tech specs and compare them to the iPhone head-to-head so you can see how powerful the DROID truly is.Techno BabbleThe DROID has a 550 MHz processor, and to be specific the Arm Cortex A8 processor that is also present in the iPhone 3GS by Samsung. The 3GS is clocked only 50 MHz higher and can be overclocked to 800 MHz. To compare that the original Xbox has a 733 MHz processor. So can the DROID be overclocked to this as well? Most likely. With a monster processor the DROID can multitask and has one of the first actual mobile OS (besides Windows Mobile 7). This also means maintaining processes running in the background to gain battery life, uninstalling apps (not just deleting them), and a lot more, but we'll get to that later. The iPhone however can not multitask due to the OS running on it, and the processor is only used in games.When it comes to graphics the DROID still hasn't been pushed to its limits. There are very few 3D games on the Android market, but as of right now the iPhone stomps the DROID in the graphics department. The DROID has a 200 MHZz PowerVR SGX 530 GPU. The iPhone has the same, but due to the slightly better CPU is can currently outperform the DROID. The iPhone has been on the market for quite some time, so there are bigger better games available. The DROID should start getting the same quality soon. They both have 256MB of RAM, so under the hood they are pretty much the same.The DROID has a slightly bigger screen sizing in at 3.7' and the iPhone at 3.5'. Does 2 millimeters matter? Yes it does. There is a good 2 millimeters on the top of the iPhone that could be screen, but for some unknown reason it's not. The DROID has a higher resolution of 854\u00d7480 and 265 ppi (pixels per inch). The 3GS has a 320\u00d7480 resolution with only 163 ppi so the DROID has double the resolution of the iPhone. That is great for people wanting to watch high-res movies on their device.Both devices have the same input such as the 3 axis accelerometer (tilt sensor), digital compass, Multi-touch display, proximity and ambient light sensors etc. The DROID is a bit heavier than the 3GS, but only by 1.2 oz. The DROID wipes the floor with the 3GS' camera. The DROID camera is 5MP compared to the 3GS 3MP. The DROID has dual LED flash, and geotagging and it can even run higher than 30 FPS. The 3GS has all this except the dual LED flash and this is a huge plus.When it comes to storage the DROID wins with its external memory option. You can insert up to a 32GB micro-SD card, but you're stuck with the 3GS' internal memory and have to pay a huge price for more. The DROID even comes with a 16GB micro- card when you buy the phone. So when it comes to comparing junk under the hood they both have the same hardware, but the DROID has the extra tidbits that push it over the edge.GUI: Graphical User InterfaceThe DROID has an excellent GUI and the whole marketplace is run by the community. There are programs such as PandaHome, OpenHome, GDEHome etc that allow you to change \"themes\" for a small price or for free. These also change icons, clock widgets etc. The DROID has a great interface that is more like a computer that gives you a desktop, then a slide up menu where all your apps are stored. You can drag and drop as you see fit. The iPhone, however, is plagued with the mundane Apple OS that only show apps in a grid format with a black background. Sure you can change your \"wallpaper\" but this is only when the phone comes out of sleep mode so it's rarely seen. This makes every iPhone look the same so the DROID wins in customization by a long shot. There are four touch buttons located at the bottom of the screen which are your back button, menu, home, and search. You will use these buttons a lot so Motorola and Google were smart to put these here.Apps: Who's Better?It all comes down to the apps. Who has more right? Well the iTunes marketplace has hundreds of thousands of apps that the DROID doesn't have so the iPhone wins there. However, the Android market is ever-growing, and thanks to the user run community a lot of great apps are showing up that the iPhone can't run. These include a lot of customization apps and loads more. Apps are easier to run on the DROID since there is no iTunes type program. The app store is run off the phone, downloaded from the phone as well. If you don't want an app anymore you go to your settings and uninstall it. Google also allows you to refund anything you buy within 24 hours and Apple does not support this. While iTunes may have more stuff, Android has better customer service and a better community and setup. There are really no \"hardcore\" games for the DROID like there is for the iPhone, but it's getting there. You do not want to get a DROID for a gaming system just yet for sure; stick with your iPod/phone.Features: Welcome to Google TownThe DROID has a lot of little things going on in it. You can do everything a touch screen phone can do, but it also has a slide out QWERTY keyboard. The buttons were a little flat and the top row is hard to get at if you have big fingers, but it works well. If you tilt the phone sideways you can type with a landscape keyboard or use Google text-to-speech. I found this feature extremely useful when typing long messages or writing reviews for apps. Since this is a Google phone you get all their awesome apps such as Google Earth (yes it's in 3D and you can see every detail), and Google maps. Switch to your \"car app\" and press navigation. Speak your selection (i.e. Phoenix, Arizona) and Google will give you directions for a car, bus, or walking (God forbid you walk that far!). Press get navigate and the phone will speak you the directions. It doesn't update in real-time, but it does update as you drive down each block.Google Sky is a fun app that lets you point your phone in the sky and it will show you, in real-time, where each constellation and planet is. You get plenty of excellent Google apps such as Gmail, YouTube (yeah Google owns YouTube), and Google Goggles which allows you to take pictures of products or objects and the phone will scan it and search it for you. There's even a Google search bar on the desktop with a text-to-speech button next to it. Brilliant. There are plenty of other apps such as the Amazon store, eBay, Bank of America, MLIA, FML, and even ShopSaavy. This app allows you to scan a barcode and it will tell you where you can find it cheaper online or locally. Of course you have all your social networking apps like Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace which run great.When it comes to things like ringtones, pictures, and videos, so the DROID delivers. You can store any MP3, or picture and set them as wallpapers, notifications, or just ringtones. Mount your SD card via USB and just create the folders. No having to sync with a program on the PC. Total freedom is what Google gives you and this is what I love.Problems: It's Not PerfectThere are some issues with the DROID, but not many and they are minor. The biggest one is the running processes in the background that can kill your battery even in sleep mode. You have to get the Advanced App Killer app and every so often check everything you don't want running and kill the apps. Another problem I ran into was that since most of the apps are user made they can be glitchy and screw up your phone so watch out and read reviews before downloading anything. You could say that the major issue is the app store. There is a lot of apps, but some of it is junk. There aren't any excellent games available, and the app store doesn't have any sort feature except Top Paid, Top Free, and Just In.For a $550 phone (if you pay for it without  a plan) the DROID delivers and trumps the iPhone in every direction except the apps. The DROID is a very advanced phone, and is for people who love using their phones constantly and make it a part of their every day life. With a sleek design, excellent features, sturdy hardware, and monster processing power the DROID should be the #1 phone in 2010.Update: 10/15/2011Now after I have had this phone for 18 months I don't like it as much. The phone started having issues with serious lag, slowdown, and just hardly responds anymore. The touch screen lost sensitivity after about a year, plus the hardware is ancient compared to what is out now. Due to that all the apps are now optimized for higher end phones so the Droid is left in the dust.Overall the phone just doesn't really work anymore internally. It won't come out of sleep mode some times, won't answer calls, turns off randomly, and the internet is just impossible to surf due to the now weak processor. Hardware wise it has stood the test of time with many drops, slides, fumbles, and kicks. Not a single crack or anything, but thankfully this phone is now discontinued. If you have the original Droid you are probably finding the same problems even after a factory reset. The phone was great 22 months ago, but now I just absolutely hate this thing. If I were to amend my score I would give it a 4/10 now, but of course that's unfair and should be remembered for how great it was at the time of release. Did I also mention that the appraisal price for the phone is about $20 now-a-days?", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "BUYER BEWARE OF THIS FIRST GENERATION ANDROID !!!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3A5L45HTFR6LJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After receiving this phone as a replacement phone for my Droid 2 Global, I was greatly disappointed.

When I ordered this phone, it came obviously used (wear and tear, some scratch marks, etc.), but that's to be expected for a $40 phone. But the thing is, the touch screen was failing at spots, and after a week, the back button/home button gave out. So I couldn't navigate through the phone; I could only text back when receiving texts, or call back from calls I missed (I wasn't able to open the phone to answer calls).So I emailed Mark (the head guy of CheapCellPhoneReplacement) about it, and I just got a \"new\" phone mailed to me to Shippensburg University. I literally just activated it five minutes ago, so I haven't called/texted/etc., but the touch screen seems to work great, and it looks like a new phone for the most part.Great phone, even if it's an old Droid.

Some aspects seem confusing. I should preface that by saying that I am not a young person, and technology is not second nature. This review will, I hope be understood by someone who, like me, is older and finds learning new things a little slow.The basic phone part is different, and when receiving a call, you need to slide a symbol over to the right in order to answer. I haven't decided whether this is operator trouble or whether this key is not working properly, but I can slide that key only about half of the time, so I miss the call and have to return it. I am told that when I get used to the touch screen, that probably will not happen. Hope this is true. (had a touch screen with my old phone, but it wasn't a smart phone and had a much different feel.)I probably won't be using the email messaging that much, as I feel much more comfortable doing that on my laptop.I plan on using this phone to play music on a docking station, and it works fantastic for this purpose, I'm able to access the internet radio stations and play anything I want to. Great , I got the phone to do just that.Now for what really is sticking in my craw. I received this phone very quickly, inserted the battery, activated the phone, but I found that since this one does not support backup, I took it to my local verizon store to have them transfer my contacts and pictures. We then discovered that this phone did not contain an SD card, which enables you to take pictures and save them and keep them in the phone. Old pictures could not be transferred until they installed one at $20.00. This seller failed to inform me that this was not included, and technically, it said the order contains a phone, wall charger, and manual, so in that respect they were indeed correct. If you are like me, you are not aware of things like this and frankly, I felt a little cheated, although technically, they win, they just didn't bother to inform the buyer that is was missing. So......the main thing I want you to know about this phone, or any refurbished phone you may purchase, you will need to educate yourself as to what is needed to fully operate this phone, and ask the seller if it is included. My seller offered to send me one free of charge, which would have delayed the use of this for another several days, and it was just easier to have one put in while I was transferring my personal stuff from the older phone. The seller assured me that they were not out to cheat me, but my point is that if they would send me one for free, they should have put it in the phone before they sent it to me.For more accurate information on this phone read the reviews here, they helped me decide to buy one, and I'm sure when I get used to it, I will like it. Much more to learn and know than with a basic phone, but when I get over the bad feeling about the SD card, I'm sure it will be just fine. :(", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "i do not recommend this item.", "Author": "tonimarie15", "ReviewID": "R3LCEKHKMVEY6J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i ordered this phone because i didn't have money to order a brand new one. this one was supposed to have a few minor scratches and wear and tear. when i got the phone, it was covered in grim and dirt. i had to wipe it down before i would even use it. it's so scratched up, it's unreal. the phone works great, but it's completely destroyed on the outside. i do not recommend this.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "this phone sucks", "Author": "magnum688", "ReviewID": "RZMFN68ZS5V1N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i got the phone it worked great for 19 days and then the screen died it started doing random action i didn't tell it to do and the cuz the screen got so bad i cant even unlock my phone any more i would say dont get the phone if you want something to last", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "GRRRRR!", "Author": "HolWil", "ReviewID": "RKAZFWP25EU9Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered phone on Friday and recieved phone today, Wednesday, the battery was dead, and the phone will not charge!

Cons-  Constantly freezez up, very very poor battery life for a moderate to heavy user. Keyboard takes some time to get used to. Cannot have many apps because most of them are not able to be put on a sd card, for example Facebook. Android OS takes some getting used to as well, and is not too stable on this phone.

I would highly recommend it for anyone who quickly needs a cheap replacement.Update 1-30-14This is now one of the worst phones I have ever owned. After a little over two months of trying to deal with it, this phone has pretty much kicked the bucket. Could not even do the simplest tasks such as dial a phone number.

It is indeed a great phone to use. very user friendly with their \"android tips\". the camera is pretty good and the sound quality is great. using the wifi and browsing the web is a piece of cake. Sad, the qwerty is a pain in the butt. the inset keys are not easy to press at all. i found myself missing a letter or adding doubles because i was pressing so firmly. I found using the electronic keyboard easier esp. if you like swype. unlike most sliders, where u can slide open with one hand, i had to use both hands to open. This phone was screwed on tight.I also don't like how the dialer would pop up when you are on a call, you would then need to hide it to reveal the contacts information. i wish the default was to show the dialer. now a days, most people do not dial numbers.I returned this phone because of software issues. I could only talk on the phone in speaker mode. For some reason the MIC doesn't recognize your voice without speaker mode. there was no work around even with a headset/earpiece. My friends still could not hear me on the other end. They can only hear me if i use the speaker phone. I performed two factory reset but the issue persisted. I even tried cleaning the mic with a needle. (which i read online fixed the problem for some people). i was close to rooting my phone but read online that this did not solve the issue. So i decided to just return it. If this phone worked perfectly, it makes a great phone. one more CON: this phone is pretty heavy. weighing almost 6 oz. it may not matter to those who travel lite, but when you have a purse full of other stuff, another 2-3 oz more, does hurt. esp when you're carrying your purse for upwards of 4 hours.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "crappy phone", "Author": "crappy fone", "ReviewID": "R18AYOLU991ZWP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well i got this phone to replace my blackberry phone that was falling apart, i had to go back to it 4 days afgter i received the phone.i was too lazzy to follow the return process. the back part peeled off.

If I want to call the last number dialed, after hitting \"recent calls\" and then the number, the screen highlights the first number but jumps to the second or third number and dials the wrong number.  This also happens with emails.  I hit one email and it opens the email an inch down the screen.  The most frustrating of all is when this happens in internet mode.  I'll hit a web page and the screen either freezes (30% of the time), jumps (30%) or does nothing (30%).  This means I get the desired webpage only one third of the time.  If I hit the link twice it often freezes totally so I have to press the home screen to start again.Sometimes the screen just freezes.  Period.  A call is coming in and I am swiping, swiping, swiping to answer and -- no screen recognition.  I miss the call.  Sometimes when I try to search the internet on the phone and hit \"DONE\" or the search icon, the phone does nothing.  I have to back, back, back out and start again.I've called Verizon and I've called Motorola.  Both horrible.  Why does the phone work in one mode just fine 20 times and then all of a sudden change?  It's unbelievably frustrating. They recommend that I get a Ph.D. in cell phones, essentially.  They tell me that If I change to setting X when I want to do this and change to setting Y when I want to do that and always remember to hit unbugging this and USB mass storage that...give me a break!  I've never changed these settings.  Why do I have to change them now to do the same things I've been doing?  It should work the same way all the time.The shutter froze shut the first time I used the camera so I can't use the camera or apps requiring a camera.
