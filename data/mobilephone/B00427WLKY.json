Since I am not with AT&T;, it was hard to find one less than $500.  I finally found this one for and I was told it was like new (used only 3 weeks). However, when the seller knew I was going to really purchase, he/she went up on the price!!! Considering that the phone had dings and scratches, and did not come with all the original parts, I thought this was a bit unfair.  I think purchases like this, should be required to have close-up photos, original paperwork and sellers should not be allowed to jack the price up without notice to possible buyers. After it was said and done, I could have bought a new one from Amazon for the same price, without the dings/scratches and with all the original parts for about the same price! I thought the packaging for mailing was lacking... at least for an expensive item like this one. The seller was pleasant and responsive to my emails and seemed to be a nice person.

I compared this one to the exact same model as my wife's T Mobile version and the crap was totally fake. When you slide the phone up, the back part of the phone was supposed to be \"black\" like my wife's but mine was \"grey\". The battery was made in Japan my wife's was made in China. I had a black berry logo in the top middle of the back cover below the camera in white letters and the back of my wife's phone did not. Her's had a description of the camera size and its capabilities. Her's said something like \"2.5 megapixels\". The screen kept freezing over and over which was pissing me off.Lastly the got damn red power button/ hang up button did not work unless I pushed it down HARD and it didnt even make the clicking noise nor could I feel it like I was pushing a \"button\". I wish I had pictures of all the comparisons to support my argument but after about a month of tolerating this phone and the broke power button and being unable to hang up after a conversation having to rely on the other party to hang up first, I slammed the phone into a million pieces and went and bought me a Galaxy S3 Mini which has not given me ANY problems like this stupid phone did.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "second 9800", "Author": "D.Leith", "ReviewID": "R1N5LRCKAPCWQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "multi function fully loaded easy to use great memory and condition hoping to get a next one soon at the same price lol.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "ClLy", "ReviewID": "RTEQ980VOOMCO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like a blackberry and smart phone all in one.
