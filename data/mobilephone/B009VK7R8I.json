{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love!", "Author": "SockMonkey", "ReviewID": "R119ORR6U6B70M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this 2 weeks ago, the iPhone 4s 16 GB in black for Virgin Mobile, and I absolutely love it! First, let me say a big thank you to Virgin Mobile for offering this phone! It's a life-saving convenience especially with how low Virgin's plans are for the iPhone compared to other carriers.I can easily see why people just can't seem to take their hands off their iPhones and why it's been so popular in the market. Before this, I had a Samsung Intercept running Android 2.2 bought around 3 years ago also for Virgin Mobile. Having had experiencing with an Android phone, I would say that I would only go back to it once they stabilize the Android operating system a bit more. My android tended to be fast for the first 2 months and then was reduced to a crawl, and then had to be hard-resetted and that made it work again (maybe a little faster, but not anything as fast as the iPhone). It would be comparing apples to oranges (pun intended) comparing my old phone with this iPhone, but it is very easy to get comfortable with the iPhone.The front and back panels are made of glass so be very careful where you put your iPhone. It will slide off couch arm-rests so it's best to put it on solid surface. I would als orecommend buying insurance (since you cannot buy any through Virgin Mobile), or get a phone case. The display is lovely, very vibrant, and Retina Display makes everything so crystal clear. The camera is probably the best I have seen. There's also a plethora of apps. Siri works great and so does FaceTime--and this has worked without any lag even when I did video chats with my parents halfway across the world! Call clarity and reception bars tend to be better on this phone than it used to be on my old Android. I would say maybe the speaker is a bit weak making sound quality not clear (using headphones it is), but it's good enough for a phone. I don't think I will feel the need to upgrade any time soon, no matter how many new iPhones or Androids are released. This phone does it all!", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just Like Everyone Else Now", "Author": "Mystery Lover", "ReviewID": "R3IUUQZ5D1R72B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally Got The Nerve To Buy This Phone....An Iphone like everyone Else i Know.....And I Gotta say i love The Crap outta It. it was easy....bought it activated it...and boom i was in iphone heaven. it works great, the service seems better i dont know why. the apps and games and the great camera. the price...well its an iphone. it dosent have a virgin mobile logo on it like other phones so i can be like everyone else. great monthly plan. i cant get over how nice it is. i suggest this sleek little phone to anyone.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Love it!", "Author": "Casey Zupan", "ReviewID": "R162TN4OCGLOXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I know everyone says that if they have an iphone but it's true.

Was easy to figure out. Has been some bugs but so far an update comes right away to fix it. They must be right on top of things with developers.

The phone has decent battery life, with some text messages, web browsing and an ocassional picture I get 8-10 hours on a single charge. The camera can still hold its own with some of the newer phones, photos taken in bright environments look excellent, in darker settings they still look decent, I took some photos in complete darkness, with the object about 2-3 feet away, using flash. The photo had enough detail, that if you ever have to make take a picture in complete darkness it won't disappoint. Calls sounds clear, and data speeds are fast enough to watch videos, most times without lots buffering on the Virgin Mobile network.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "Marilu", "ReviewID": "R2PKSQPV7U3WZ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this phone!  it is all that its hyped up to be... do recommend it.  you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best Phone I've ever had!", "Author": "Mistee c.", "ReviewID": "R3BXKA88Z1AML7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone!
