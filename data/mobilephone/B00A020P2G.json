With dual sim active both sims are always active and works as if two phones are in one. This is really what i wanted.Now to explain the above, this phone tries to remedy the situation by using call forwarding (a paid service on my network)so it has an option for dual sim always on, this option attempts to enable call forwarding for both sims and if it fails (as in my case) then even if i would pay for forwarding,i can not have both sims active at once.In my case forwarding fails because both sims have group calling service on them. Most dissapointed as this is one of the primary reasons for buying this phone.(2) Phone can be a bit slow, but i am used to the ks660 LOL.(3) If i looked up a contact there is no way to use the secondary sim to call from the contact list so i have to use dial pad where the option is, this is so not good.I would give the phone a two star for the above but the other features are great (well it's android) hence the new rating of three stars. So here i go again, off to sell this phone for what i can get and once again start a lengthy search for the dual sim ACTIVE android that i need.

BUT, guess what, it was locked and the default language on this phone was some type of Polish, Russian or some weird East European Language. This made me believe that this phone was stolen by a clerk working for a Russian T-Mobile service provider or some East European National Wireless provider... anyway, I figured out to switch it back to English, to my dismay, the phone is LOCKED and can NOT work on US service providers.... so I called my provider (T-Mobile) hoping to get help... after 30 minutes of being on-hold, the T-Mobile folks did not recognize the iemei number on the phone (it's Russian); and could not help me. They suggested that I call Samsung. 45 minutes of wait, someone sends me to an online web site where they have instructions to download a bunch of software.I follow the instruction, I plug the phone onto a USB connector, then download various files, pay $19.95 to European SIM unlocking services, then another $14.95 to make it work on US providers, then I paid $4.95 to make sure that the phone is NOT black-listed... I still can't make it work.

Stock Android, while not as smooth an experience as iOS, is light years ahead of TouchWiz. What Samsung does to Google's baby could arguably be called abuse. And because Samsung will not allow stock Android on its devices, users are stuck waiting for them to implement TouchWiz on new versions of Android. Unfortunately, this means that the S Duos is stuck now and possibly forever, on Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4. Nevermind that KitKat 4.4 could run on the S Duos; because Samsung hasn't said yes, it won't happen. Is this what an open computing platform is supposed to be? It is possible, however, to install CM 10.1 on this handset. The downside to that is you lose dual-SIM functionality, this handset's distinguishing feature. Dual SIM support is not native to Android and its implementation is up to the manufacturer and Samsung (and LG, Sony, etc) aren't giving up their secrets.The hardware side of the S Duos isn't any better. The TFT screen is nicely saturated, but even at 50% brightness, blacks are washed out and gray. The TFT panel doesn't have very good viewing angles, either. The digitizer is, in my experience, extremely finicky: swipes register as taps and apps are launched without warning because the air somehow managed to trigger a tap. I could be holding the S Duos in hand with no fingers or palm within a centimeter of the screen and an app could launch. Touch input also suffers because this handset is extremely prone to lag. The single-core, 1GHz Cortex A5 CPU and Andreno 205 GPU do not perform well at all. If you expect to use only stock Samsung (not Google!) apps on this handset, you might be fine and experience little lag. Otherwise, prepare to have even the keyboard app stutter due to lag.Build quality is likewise shoddy. The phone is all plastic. That is to be expected at this segment, but where LG and Sony have similar handsets that feel like premium devices, the S Duos feels cheap. It also looks cheap. After about a month of use, the paint on the gray plastic that makes up the side of the device is white in spots. The USB port is likewise spotted. That's right, Samsung couldn't even be bothered to use colored plastic, instead opting to paint white plastic. The battery is a 1500mAh unit. If you are a heavy user of things like the stock SMS app, expect to run down the battery at around the 8-hour mark. Nevermind streaming movies over 3G or taking pictures all day. Really, don't bother taking pictures because the 2GB of onboard storage means that after the OS and Samsung's bloatware, users really only have access to less than half that amount.Even after all that complaining, I can find one other terrible thing about the S Duos: it powers down randomly. Whether in my pocket, in my hand, or on a table, sometimes the S Duos will just power down completely. It turns itself off, even when in the middle of audio playback.As soon as I am able, I will replace this piece of garbage phone. I have my eye on an LG Optimus L7 II Dual, Sony Xperia M dual, or Sony Xperia C. Needing dual-SIM support means I am effectively stuck in the midrange of Android devices, and that's fine with me. I just wish I hadn't wasted nearly $200 on this terrible phone and Samsung has definitely lost a customer in me.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Wish I Would Not Have Bought It", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2CCPZEH1CL9N4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I read the reviews stating that this handset is slow.  I thought, \"I don't need the fastest phone in the world.\"  Yet, I have used it now for 3 months and it is becoming annoying.  I wish I had not bought it - and I am probably stuck with it for two years. For example, when I am just looking at my email and then have to make a call, I have to wait 5-10 seconds for the keypad to come up to make a call.  That seems trite, but how many calls do you make a day?  It gets really bothersome.  I appears that Samsung made a mistake by not putting a fast enough processor in this phone.  It looks great but I would not have bought it and I would be happy to go back to carrying around two phones.  Also, my wife has an older iphone - the iphone 3.  Her phone is faster than this one.  I think her iphone came out in 2008.

After about 2 weeks of use it developed some sort of interference that you can hear when making calls. I was disappointed, but I could overlook this. Next I noticed that if you put this phone in your pocket it would shut itself off. I think what happens is that while in a pocket, both the front & side buttons get pressed simultaneously, which turns the phone off (like a forced shutdown on a PC). This is pretty inconvenient, I mean WTF, a phone that you can't put in your pocket? Still, I decided to keep on with this phone. Then, for some mysterious reason this phone deleted all of my contacts. Maybe it happened during one of the times it was shutting itself off in my pocket, I have no idea, the contacts were just gone.

Although it's listed as, and apparently has, 4gb of memory, only 1.78gb is actually available for use.  As explained to me, this is rather typical of smart phones.  In my case however, I really needed the extra memory for my critical applications.  Some files and apps can be moved to an SD card.  Mine cannot.My Nexus 4 broke the day before I left the country for 3 months, and had this one sent to me overnight.

It looks good, is not too heavy, but the performance is pathetic for a smartphone sold in 2013 by a company like Samsung:- the screen brightness is not nearly enough on a sunny day, always have to use my hand to shade the display- touchscreen reacts completely randomly. Half the time it takes a pinch zoom in google maps (and other apps) as a tap, or doesn't react at all- annoyingly slow: have to clear RAm every few hours to make it react a little smoother again- crashes almost once a day, quite often google maps (latest updates installed, also new firmware recently)- even standard phone functions such as opening the call screen, or message screen takes ages. The call is already being placed and I still can't type anything (for example a number while on a hotline) because the phone screen just hasn't shown up yet- listening to music quite often renders the phone unusable, possible related to the payer I use although I haven't rrady any reviews stating that behavior- camera is crapHere the few upsides:- sound is good, even listening to music works good enough for me- only have tested it with one SIM card so far, works fineSo all in all I'm very dissapointed. I understand that Samsung thinks the dual SIM feature is so amazingly special that the can sacrifice perfomrance and to some extend I would accept this. However using this piece of crap is no fun at all, my 80$ china dual sim S3 copy worked ten times better.Unfortunately I'm travelling overseas right now and had no chance to return it so I'm stuck with it.
