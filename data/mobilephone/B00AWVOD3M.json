Woodward", "ReviewID": "R4IAV29KHOES2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because I got sick of all the fancy smart phones braking on me. I decided to go back to the basics. This thing is tough. It is practically unbreakable. I even dropped in water and it still works fine. My favorite thing about the item is the flashlight. I use it all the time and it is super bright. It is a basic phone that will live up to any challenge.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "cell phone", "Author": "David O.

Not to mention the battery stays charged for 4 to 6 days no joke.

I'm actually just assuming it's indestructible because it's the size of a brick. An actual brick. It's thick and bulky. HOWEVER, it's got awesome battery life (get it together \"smart\"phones) that probably lasts a week and a half. Also, it's got this AWESOME flashlight (no app download necessary). For some reason since i bought this phone that flashlight is SUPER handy. So, thank you Kyocera. overall It's an awesome phone - very basic, but I am not regretting this purchase. One thing, the ringtones on this thing is SUPER loud, so if you're losing your hearing, it's got some high pitch ring tones. :) Enjoy!", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beefy and lite", "Author": "WildColorado", "ReviewID": "R1GPDP5ENDW82Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far so good. I like the design and have no major complaints.The phone appears to be \"Water PROOF\", so I like that. My first impression is that I could treat this phone far rougher than any other phone I have owned, without the concern that it will break.The web interface is minimal, but 3g without a touchscreen is just fine for me.Also, I am the only one I have seen with this phone so it is a bit of an eye catcher.Caveat: It is a major brick of a phone.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kyocera DuraPlus E4233 Sprint Cell Phone", "Author": "Southern Vet \"Southern Vet\"", "ReviewID": "R34OEZYPH5RVN8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is in perfect condition. So much so I wonder if they sent me a new one by mistake. At any rate it is exactly what I wanted. I bought this as a gift for my neighbor who is a contractor. He's hard on his tools and gear and this should suit him perfectly. All he wanted was a tough phone and I'm pretty sure this is it.
