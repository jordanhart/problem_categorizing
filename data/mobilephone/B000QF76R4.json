I have never had any trouble with this phone to this day. I wish all phones were made like this. It is seriously the best phone I have ever owned. The only problem is that I cannot access internet on it and it is now an outdated phone. I have they had a newer version of this which was reliable as this phone. I would buy it in a heartbeat!! LG do this again!!", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG Telephone", "Author": "Paul M.
