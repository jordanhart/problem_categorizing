The other reviewer is referring only to the alarm.  And while dedicated web and mail keys may seem unnecessary on a prepaid phone, where you wouldn't expect a lot of Internet access, this phone is also used with other types of T-Mobile plans.One other thing.  The product description has an error.  While text messages on T-Moble's monthly plans are $0.20 to send and receive, on the prepaid plans they are $.10 to send and $.05 to receive.

Burgoa", "ReviewID": "R2TKUCHS1ND7CO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had bought this phone a few months ago to replace my old nokia phone. I wasn't looking for something extravagant, just something basic. This phone pretty much suited my needs.Video and camera are all pretty much standard; nothing over the top. Some of the photos I shot came out a bit fuzzy but as I mentioned, I only wanted a basic phone. I didn't mind if the photos were not crystal-clear. However, the photos were not so blurry where you couldn't make out what was in the photo.Volume is my only complaint I have about this phone. If I'm in a very noisy place, a restaurant, city, or wherever, and I'm trying to listen to someone, even when I have the volume on the highest setting, sometimes it's still very hard to hear what the other person says. This gets very frustrating.All in all, I'm content with this samsung phone. People who are looking for a phone with a lot of extra features that some of the newer phones come with will not find much with this phone. Nevertheless, if you're looking for only a basic phone, this one will do the trick.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fabulous phone - works like a charm", "Author": "B.

The battery life is long. I think I just charged it once a week and that was it.I have dropped it countless times and it has been alright. What makes it nice is that it is still kinda in style with the slider thing going on.The only thing that I found sort of puzzling was the alarm system. With the older Samsung I had onced owned, I was able to set my alarm and actually turn off the phone. It would then turn itself on when the alarm would go off. That was really cool because I wasn't wasting the battery power while I slept. But with the SGH-T239, the feature for self alarm startup is not present. So when I set the alarm the phone has to be on all night wasting my battery life. Good thing it holds a good charge.

I agreed to have the next model up sent out but was completely disappointed to learn it was an unlocked phone not a T-mobile phone as advertised. I will give the company props though for being so quick to respond and helpful when I first contacted them about the missing phone.

The battery life is great.  The sound is good.  I agree with Alisa's review that it is unfortunate that the cell phone does not turn on in the alarm setting.  My one real complaint, however, is the lack of profile settings.  This phone replaces a cheaper $20 Nokia phone that had timed settings--for example, you could set the phone to be silent until a certain time.  This was extremely useful if I went into a meeting and did not want to worry about forgetting to change the setting back to normal.  It also allowed personal saved profiles with the combination of ring, vibration, etc. I wanted.  Other than that, I really do like the phone.

It does have Bluetooth but it is specifically not provided with any software that allows one to directly transfer (i.e. upload) photos to a pc or a Mac.So how do you get the photos out?  Per the user manual, you email them to yourself one photo at a time!  That's right, one photo at a time..You also can upload them to your Samsung MyAlbum somewhere on the web, but I believe that uses up some of your minutes.Anyway, my personal feelings is that this is pretty archaic.  My 5 year old Nokia 6102 flip phone uses Bluetooth to upload to pc's or macs.Plus the photos are VGA. Her pictures were grainy and fuzzy.
