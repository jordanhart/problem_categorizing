{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Horrible phone, Horrible customer service", "Author": "mark", "ReviewID": "R31KCIBD0I16Q8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We received this phone (new and still in the package) two days ago. We went to ATT to set it up. After an hour, they said they could not help us. The phone was not responding. We called BLU technical support to see if they could help us. After being placed on hold for 25 minutes, the representative returned only to tell us that this particular phone often has this problem and that we would need to ship it to them (at our cost) and wait 45 days for them to fix it!!  I bought the phone because I NEEDED a phone. Waiting 45 days is absurds. Plus, if this is a common occurrence, they should 1. Stop selling the phone until the problem is fixed. OR 2. Pay for overnight shipping and return a working phone within 48 hours, along with a huge apology. I will not ever buy a product of theirs again.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007BYSMTO"}}
