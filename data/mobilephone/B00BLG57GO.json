Khalilova", "ReviewID": "RDN0I2R6DGHQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a good phone. But there are some things you should consider before buying.1. There are 2 identically looking models with different frequencies - C6602 and C6603. See which one u want. There is no universal model2. Screen is very good but not IPS. There is some color degradation going when turning it. Also black level is more like gray, so contrast suffers.3. Get ready with your MicroSIM4. Battery life is excellent when on standby, and so-so when actually using phone. Rooting and underclocking CPU does not help much. It might be indicator or something else. Sometimes after 10 min work u get 10% loss of battery. I get 2 days out of battery for now.5. Charger is really awkward, it's two piece which easily falls apart. I don't use it.6. It doesn't support 5.8GHz WiFiIt is still very good looking, fast phone. Speaker is superloud. Music play (MP3) quality is much better than my US SGS3. There is FM radio. It accepts 64GB microSDXC cards. It is water and dust protected.

I dropped it four feet onto concrete this evening and not a scratch! The only thing I want to add is that another reviewer stated this was the docomo version (which would mean japanese and with a locked down bootloader) but the model I received from ranas electronics was not the docomo variant. The bootloader was fully unlockable. I know this matters to a lot of people and I was very pleasantly surprised as I thought I had made a mistake and was going to have to live with rooted stock for the life of this phone.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's not that bad", "Author": "Danny Fallas", "ReviewID": "R1RSGX8WYC3WBD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I own a nexus 4, this phone was for a friend.

The colors simply are the best I have seen and contrast is quite good too. I have used a galaxy note and an iPhone 4 and was a bit worried after reading a few reviews but now I am very satisfied. In fact had a video shoot out for a 720p video (oblivion trailer) with a note2- and the winner was clearly the ZL. The difference in screen size is almost insignificant. I will write in detail about the display later as there is so much more to talk.2) Battery (stamina mode)- 100% charge at 6am - normal day- 25mins of calls, 40mins watched videos, 30-40mins of browsing(WiFi and 3G), 30-40mins of messaging and mail, 20-25mins Google play, 20mins gaming(asphalt7), 20-30mins misc. = ended the day with about 46% charge at 11:30pm. (I don't think I will be using my phone for 3hrs every day - this is only in the beginning :-) need to use my nexus 7 as well from time to time so that it doesn't feel left out) - big plus to stamina mode3) Performance - normal operation- with a quad core processor u wud expect lag free but I did feel slight lag from simply scrolling the home screen- this can be attributed to custom ui and frankly I have seen this on almost all android handsets except the nexus devices which don't have any lag even on dual core processors. In fact the lag vanished on my old note when I rooted and loaded a custom ROM on it. This lag is insignificant and 90% of people won't be able to notice it- only maybe the ones who have used an iPhone - which funnily shows some lag when it is rooted.4) Performance - games - simply a beauty - zero lag and excellent load times - faster than note and iphone4 - tested asphalt7. Also remember this phone is displaying 1080p so it is amazing that it manages to run significantly faster. It is also slightly faster than note 2 - though not by much.5) Camera - quite good. The best in outdoor shots and pretty good at indoor shots. Colors are quite good and realistic- I am not a fan of camera on a phone but I like the camera on my old iPhone 4 and now this.6) Audio - I felt it was a bit low on volume at first but after using it for last 4 days it does not seem inadequate at all - the volume is slightly lower than my note but the audio is much clearer and very pleasant to hear. The stock earphones are quite good too.Overall very satisfied with the phone - and as a plus the design feels quite good too - IMHO best smart phone have had the joy of owning but this is purely personal preference. I chose this over the Z as this is easier to hold with a curved back.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dont buy it!", "Author": "Valeriya", "ReviewID": "RMZP7JP7ZZ0EV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone and i was so surprised when i received my box. First. I love Sony Ericsson. I have now Sony Ericsson Arc S. So when i open the box i was so confuse. This phone was look like fake. You can understand it since you see the box. Quality of a paper of the box so poor!!! Sony never use it like this!!!! About phone. Phone was with a screen protecter. So the screen was full of bubbles!!!! It wasnt look that somebody take it out already. Was look like Chinese fake! It was in front side and back side. I remember when i ordered my phone (which i use now) it was perfect everything!!!!! And box and quality of paper and screen protect!!!!!! Everything!!! So when i turned on my new phone..Here is the same .. sometimes this phone didnt feel my fingers... So VERY VERY bad quality!!!!! I decided return this phone. Here was again surprise!!! They refund just 80% from cost. So i spend for this phone around $600 They give me back just $468...So they made around $130 from nothing!!!!!!!! and i dont have anything for this money neither!!! Im so mad. It was my first time big order on Amazon. (usually i use ebay). I never had this problem before. All my electronics i bought by internet. I never never will use this company again.

Nice speed.Good video quality.Great Camera.The \"huh\"?These are specifically directed because this is a Docomo version:Many of the icons, system notifications and of the assorted functions are in Japanese. If you don't read Japanese, this may be a small problem. Most of the functions are not critical. Selecting a different language works for the important functions. Selecting autodial functions automatically add Japanese international calling codes to the phone number (which can have unexpected and unpleasant results I would imagine if you don't catch it in time...calling Japan...to your phone bill). Most of the icons I imagine are associated with Docomo, which is the Japanese equivalent of Google. The phone also has Google functions in parallel.The negatives:Android 4.1.2 isn't as advanced as I would have imagined it would be. Its quite similar to the V2. Doesn't seem to be a fantastic upgrade.Call sound quality...too quiet. Slightly muffled. The sound quality is slightly better on the X10, and was much better on the LT18i.Waterproof? Well...the external speaker for phone ringer and application sounds was quite good. Then, while testing out the waterproof claims of the phone. Now the sound on the external speaker is nearly non-existent. Too quiet to be heard from my pocket (which is where it should normally be). Now the external speaker is not quite useless, but close enough while its in my pocket to make the phone useless. No warranty, not that it would cover water damage anyways? So, I have a useless $1200 phone. I had to have the one that wasn't black or white and order it from Japan. I have checked the settings. THe XLoud function doesn't seem to be working. Its activated, but it doesn't change the volume of the phone anymore. For those of you who own one, I made sure the port seals were all in their proper sealed position (but the external speaker is nowhere near any of the open ports). Initially, the external sound quality was SUPERIOR. Now, its way below average.The network coverage on this phone is merely adequate. It seems to have a My Xperia X10 gets and holds signals much better. Somebody mentioned that it doesn't pick up 3G, I never tested that extensively, since my areas don't have great 3G or 4G coverage.Only comes with a 2GB MicroSD. Switched my Xperia X10's 8GB MicroSD with it. (Um...is that an upgrade then?)Uses micro Sim. You might have to upgrade your SIM...I wasn't prepared for it. I had to wait an extra week for a new SIM. I resisted my friend's recommendations to just \"cut\" the standard SIM. :)Overall, I am pissed that I am dealing with a phone that's external sound quality is now poor. If it gets better when it dries out, I'll update this review. However, I won't trust the waterproof nature of the phone again, even if it does \"come back to life\".Update: It dried out. External speaker is working fine again...Still have to ask...if its waterproof, why does it stop working?Update2: I would also like to say that the battery life on this phone is far superior to any Sony-Ericsson I've owned before. Whatever they did is fantastic. Normally, I could go one to two days between charges on the phone. Two to Three on the LT18i. Right now, the XperiaZ is running about nine days between charges.
