{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It is a decent  basic phone.", "Author": "M. Berto LMP", "ReviewID": "R2OW3X3MFLIBDO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone was delivered on time and in good shape. Beyond that, not at all what I expected. First, it is black-not silver. Second, it is a very cheap phone. It serves its purpose for the most part, but if you are a texter- you will be disappointed. I can text faster than the phone. It has a big problem keeping up with me and I have to sit and wait for it to catch up with me before I can send any text.I am pretty disappointed in this phone. I wanted basic, but this is way more basic than I wanted. There seems to be an echo when I talk on the phone (like it is a cheap plastic toy).The best features it has are the \"ice\" and \"fake call\" features. I have been having fun with the fake call- and the \"ice\" is a good safety feature.It is a cute little kiddie phone, it is NOT a serious phone! I already have an iPad,so I wasn't really looking for a smartphone, but I did want something with a little more grown up technology than this phone has.I will be getting a different phone as soon as I can!", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006YFOZNS"}}
