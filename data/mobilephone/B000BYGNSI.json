I was very scared in scratching the screen (I've always done this in my past phones) and this one is incredible solid! the phone also felt down once, of course with no intention, and continue working normal.It has cool features, you can personalize where to locate your quick options in the menu, so you get a very simple navigation. Finally i have to say that the battery is great...i can use it for 4 days with regular use and continues working.CONS:The internal memory is poor.No USB cable included.Pictures with low resolution(but normal in cell phones of its kind)This phone is still BIG and heavy considering some other models.For the price, durability and apparel this one is a good choice.I've never made friends with nokia in the past, and i regret, beacuse this is a very good choice if you need a hard-everyday-use phone...simple and firm.", "Date": "September 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "It has its ups and downs...", "Author": "B. Price", "ReviewID": "R2ZCCIV70YC9BB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for just over a year now, and it has been a good phone, but after a year of use, its pretty shot.  It operates fine, but the physical looks and features wear out very fast.  The rubber side pieces were a nice little thing to have until they started to yellow and they all fell off.  It doesn't support mp3 ringtones.  However, I have never had a problem with the service and its been a great phone for texting and talking.  Battery life is pretty good also.  I absolutely love the user-friendly menus and screen features.  Nokia has done a great job creating one of the best phone operating systems out there.", "Date": "July 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "I Just Love My Nokia 3220. Here's Why!", "Author": "J. Russell", "ReviewID": "ROY8V7R72QR35", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First a disclaimer. I am an unabashed biased Nokia phone user. They have better reception, better user interface, better reliability, and free PC Suite Nokia PC connection software(read this OUTLOOK/SYNC CONTACTS BACKUP).This phone has a thoughtful alarm sequence and missed call/msg/alarm alert. It begins with vibrate, moves to vibrate+low ring, then vibrate+increasing louder ring, and finishes with occasional side light blinks if you never answer. Very pleasant non-irritating reminder.The Contact Note length has been increased from previous Nokia Series 40 phones about 4 times. This is very nice if you use your phone to add extra info notes to your contacts, a very nice business feature. The PDA features have been expanded with TODO lists, Weekly calendar/appts view, Notes list, and Meeting/Memo alarm types.The GOTO list has been expanded for customizable quick access to your most used phone functions. Contacts, Msg, Calendar, and Camera functions access are fixed on the navigation keys. Nice. The camera is good for email and 4X6 shots in adequate light only. Typical of these business phones.Some reviews on the inet mention this phone is designed to attract the younger crowd because of its side lights and customizable 'electric' face plate option. Well, this may be, but for the rest of us practical users, without the option face plate, this is a very small and thin small business phone with side lights that blink when a msg/call is arriving and blink intermittently forever until you look at any missed msg/call/alarms. NICE!I won't mention all the other features because they are covered in others reviews and are in the specs, so let me just say this is an excellent phone for anyone from the young to the small business person to the less experienced user. It covers most of the bases needed, and in a small, practical, feature laden platform.Did I mention it has three ways to backup your precious and value contact/notes data base, tediously built up over valuable time; SIM CARD on board stores/backs-up to 256 contact numbers, SyncML Client to upload your full phone memory to free online backup/recover sites, and thirdly, Nokia's free PC Suite Windows software that makes your phone appear as just another external storage device you can 'Explore'!You will like it if your heart is not set on an MP3 player and HiQ Camera combination device. More to go wrong so better separate in my opinion.I have been very pleased with T-Mobiles service in S CA. You can use this phone as a no contract GO PHONE for 8.5 cents per minutes when you buy a T-Mobile SIM card and a 1000 minute card as low as $85. If you chatter a lot, then the free nights/weekends/faves minutes with contract and phone makes more sense. Hope this helps. :)", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "solid basic phone", "Author": "Y.

I've had a selection oh phones since this one and they didnt compare, so as of now I'm waiting on my new nokia 3220. The menu isnt as bad as one person said, and there are short cut menus.

I just recently changed the cover because the phone comes with two, which is a nice feature.My only complaints are that there is no regular phone ring tone. They are all songs or the T-moblile ringtone. The other thing is that the select button is kind of odd and can be difficult to use by just pushing down on it. Sometimes it goes right to the camera or other features and not the menu.This phone has held up pretty good for me.

By the 3rd day, it was dry, and it worked just like new !  Working well for 3 weeks and counting.3/ calls are loud and clear, both to me and the recepient, given the phone's got 2 bars or more.  T-mobile service.Cons1/ resolution of the photos are 0.3 megapixel, I believe.2/ it's a basic, basic phone.interesting factoid.

The keys take a little getting used to since each square button has 2 numbers on it and they rock either up or down to choose. The earphone volume is not quite loud enough (on max), but I may just be a little hard of hearing. The display is typical but I wish the text were larger in many cases, but again maybe my eyes aren't too great either. The ringer is outstanding; you can't miss hearing it. The battery life is really great. Some of the features are a bit cryptic and somewhat hard to find, but they are there and they work well.

I've had it for two years and while it has taken a beating it still works great.  Every once in a while the OS needs a reboot, but that is rare.  The sound quality is good, but at times I wish it were louder, even with the manual volume adjustment.  I also use it for basic scheduling reminders.  This is where I find the originally unexpected lights on the side of the phone to be useful.  In a darkened room with the phone on silent, the lights flash brightly for alarms, calls, txts, and voice-mails.The only reasons why I'm dropping this phone is that I'm moving to an area with poor T-Mobile coverage (not the phone's fault) and I require better email and texting features.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Its ok", "Author": "Sharia \"sha\"", "ReviewID": "R2FL0YKO0IH7SY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If u tend to drop ur phone a lot.

And at first, I loved it. I thought it was the coolest thing. It could light up, take pictures, and make sound recordings. This was a great first phone.However, I've definately outgrown it, but due to certain circumstances in my life, I'm stuck with it. Now the phone seems clunky compared to all those cool sleek phones out there, the image quality is nothing amazing, and it only can hold polyphonic ringtones.Bottom line: I would recommend this phone for parents buying kids their first phone. However, this is by no means a good phone for the experienced cell phone user.** Also, get a deal with Cingular or T-Mobile to get this phone for about $20. By no means pay the price they have in the store and online of $100.

My service is T-Mobile, and according to the manual, the carrier has the option of altering the menu interface.  I suspect that this was the case, because my interface did not match the one in the manual.  Anyhow, there were no submenus.  Rather, everything from your phone directory to text messages, to adjusting the ringtone, to using email, is listed in a HUGE list.  This means that to do something as simple as send a text message, you must scroll through a list of about 100 items to get to the text message inbox.Also, the volume of the earpiece was extremely quiet.  In an empty room at home, with no noise coming from outside, I could not hear the other person talk unless I shoved the end of the phone against my ear, and even then they were barely audible.  With my previous cell phone, I could hear the person talk even if I held the phone an inch away from my head.  There are no buttons to speak of on the side of the phone (e.g. volume control), and I didn't see any call-volume controls in the menu.The blinking colored lights on the sides were bright and fantastic, but otherwise this phone is lacking in every way possible.", "Date": "December 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not what I hoped for", "Author": "S.

The camera does not allow me to send pictures.  Or my settings, that came with the phone are not sufficient.  This is one of the best reasons to have a camera phone. The 2nd unique feature that I was so excited about was the FM radio function.  My phone does not have that capability either.  Even after sending one back and receiving a brand new phone (exact model as first), no FM function.  Now I don't have options but to contact Nokia direct, which I don't think I should have to do with a brand new phone.  So I am not impressed with this model and do not recommend it.
