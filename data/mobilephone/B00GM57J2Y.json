Before this I had Galaxy Note II and this Nokia 1520 feels great. It's amazingly fast. The most valuable thing I found in this phone is the Camera. The camera has all the DSLR functions and it is 20 mp. The 1080p display with bright and brilliant picture is perfect to watch movies and videos.I wear jeans all the time and it fits fine in my front pockets.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome device!!  Highly recommended!", "Author": "Russell", "ReviewID": "R2RVO77P87YKRO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Week One Review (11/29)!So after having this phone for 1 week, I'm glad to say that I just love it...love it...love it!!  I can't even imagine going back to using a smaller phone.1. Screen...awesome! Extremely clear.  The reading experience in the Kindle app on a phone is finally good enough for me to actually want to use it on it.  Finished the last 4 chapters of the Phoenix Project on it Tuesday.  I tried but just couldn't get used to it on my 920.  Always ended up pulling out the tablet.2. Battery life...insane!  Days!  Example, I spent Thanksgiving with most of the people I text or call so I must admit calling and texting were...a bit low.  But, as usual, it was plugged in the previous night so was fully charged, WiFi and Bluetooth were enabled the entire day (I only use Bluetooth headsets), everybody wanted to check it out so I had to let them (more battery use), I personally had lighter than normal use just using some of my daily basic apps, but I didn't plug it in last night since the battery indicator was still really full and woke this morn... ok I just typed all that up then remembered you can see the exact info in Settings.  Ok...so the battery saver in settings shows:battery infoRemaining battery life 75%Estimated time remaining 1 day 6 hoursTime since last charge: 21 hours.That's what I'm talking about.  I had to get an external battery for my 920 because although that phone is really good, the battery...not so much.  It always ran out at the worst possible time (of course).  It is now truly a backup phone in the event something happens with this one.3. Photos...simply great!  Nokia keeps delivering with their camera integrations.  The pictures are just so very good and high quality. I won't get into all of the camera apps because they could take all day to explain but I generally just use the convenient point and shoot. Works perfectly for my needs and the pictures come out great.I have been experiencing one small problem, though.  It worked fine on my 920 but there seems to be an issue with glance's \"double-tap to wake\".  If you don't know what that is, it's a small but very nice feature by Nokia that allows you to double tap anywhere on the screen to wake the phone up after the screen auto turns off rather than having to press the power button.  It really is a great feature in that once you start using it, you don't realize just how good the feature is until you use a device where pressing a specific button is required to wake it up.  Anyway, on my 1520, sometimes it works on a double.... sometimes it doesn't.  It always eventually works, just not on a double.  It's more of a ... a quadratap most times. Even a sexatap (I like that one)!!  I thought that maybe at times my hands were too dry when tapping it or the screen was possibly dirty but addressing those didn't do anything.  If you got used to double-tapping, you might have to get unused to it and do a \"tap-until\" to wake.  Small issue and definitely not a show stopper.And that's it for my review of this 1520.  It's obvious I was excited about this device and am so glad MS and Nokia delivered. Finally...expandable storage on the high-ends, too!  The device simply doesn't disappoint.  Windows phone keeps getting better and better, apps keep coming, and, my god, MS is even buying Nokia mobile.  I'm definitely impressed with what's going on here.  So, with that, and as previously stated, this device is highly recommended!  That's all, folks!Day One Review (11/22):The device is actually quite sweet. I live in NY and was able to get a 1520 on the 2nd attempt at an AT&T; store on 54th and 7th. They only had black and red, though. I wanted white. But, other than the color, the device is on point with what some of the online reviews are saying: Large to hold but exceptional as a phablet. If you preordered and it wasn't shipped to you, I actually do recommend waiting a bit longer for it. It's sweet. And If you are familiar with Windows Phone 8 versions and all, it is running OS version 10517. My 920's version is 10512. Here are some of the other good-to-knows:1. This has \"glance\" as well as the new \"driving mode\" preinstalled.2. Inserted a 64gb card and the device instantly recognized it and presented the options on what it should be used for. I allocated it for music, content and video storage (which I fully intend on filling up). This version only has 16gb internal and at the moment it shows I have about 9.28gb free. I installed some offline maps though so that's taking up the majority of that used space. Supposedly a 32gb model will be \"coming soon\". I'll get it, (well try too anyway), the day its released and as far as I can tell with the exception of the onslaught of sensors that are currently coming, it should hold its own for a while.3. When adding an account in \"email+accounts\" , new providers exist that don't appear on the 920 like \"IBM Notes Traveler\", \"LinkedIn\" and \"Nokia Mail\".4. Haven't had a chance to really use the camera except for a few basic snaps but, as expected, they're quite nice. But the 920's were awesome so I've never had any issues there.5. Regarding the weight, it's not so bad. I've always carried phones in my back pocket so the size of this phone and its weight is a non-issue. I had ordered and received a \"Yousave Nokia Lumia 1520 Case Black\" which gives it even more heft and size, but not so much as to make me not keep it in the case.I was under the impression that this device had Bluetooth 4.0 LE but I don't think that it does yet as it doesn't recognize things that my surface does. It must be a part of a future update that Nokia keeps referring to regarding it. The sooner LE is available the better.This is not an Xbox review but since it I received a Day One as well as my 1520 today, a quick comment regarding them is that the Xbox One SmartGlass app on this phone is just too cool. The device can be toggled to be a touchpad for the Xbox interface. (I need to find an app that can do that with Windows 8.) Anyway, I didn't have an Xbox 360 so can't compare to how it worked with the other version of SmartGlass so this might be old news to some but ahhh.....gotta love it!!Anyway, this phone was all about the size. So if and when you do decide to get into the 6 inch devices, this one, as has been expected for some time, is awesome and highly recommended!(My original review pertained to a poor shipment experience from Microsoft which appears to have violated some of the review rules. It was misleading because I had to select a star to post but it appeared the star was referring to a product that I didn't actually have yet although I couldn't start the review without it. So, anyway, end result of what turned out to be a pretty good day, the phone is exactly what I was convinced to buy months ago and I definitely recommend it!)", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$620.00", "Features": "Windows Phone 8\n6.0 inches\n1080 x 1920 pixels\n20 megapixels\nQualcomm Snapdragon 800 MSM8974 processor", "Name": "Nokia Lumia 1520 - Black - for AT&T and Unlockable - LTE", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4156AJUZW4L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GM57J2Y"}}
