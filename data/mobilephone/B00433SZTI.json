This phone is it.If you're looking for a phone that does apps/games/music/web surfing, then you're better off getting a smart phone.The call quality has been good for me. Make sure to check AT&T;'s coverage map, because results will vary.This phone has an easy-to-use interface and allows for plenty of customization. The silver disc supports 4 custom shortcuts, and the \"Go To\" button supports 12 shortcuts. Even without shortcuts, you're still only a few clicks away from most menu options.The camera is good enough for setting a custom wallpaper, but don't expect to win any photography awards. This phone wasn't build to handle a lot of media. It supports up to 27 photos at 640x480 (the highest resolution), and about 200 photos with the average setting.I especially like the Alarm. You can set alarms that span certain days (e.g. one for weekdays, one for weekends, one for M-W-F).The phone has a MicroUSB port, which could allow you to charge your phone from your computer (the phone ships with a wall charger).For those concerned with health risks, this phone has a very low SAR rate (0.24 W/kg at the ear). It's well below the federal limit of 1.6 W/kg.Again, this phone does not have a lot of bells-and-whistles, but it works well. With occasional use (~ 300 minutes or less per month), it will end up saving a lot of money over a contract plan.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good value for money", "Author": "Gadget-Guru", "ReviewID": "R1GNN4WXZ5SQPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you deduct the 15$ airtime credit from the price you get good value for your money. The phone is basic, but really good for voice calls and text messages. The cover is made from durable plastic. If the display is difficult to read in bright sunshine you might try increasing the brightness of the display. In case you are looking for the SIM PIN: it is 1111 on att gophones. The phone is very leight and the battery really lasts long. So do compare the amazon.com product description with the net price (20$) you are paying. If you expect a camera with a higher resolution or any other big feature you have to look for another phone.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nothing Special", "Author": "J. D. Andersen \"Jim\"", "ReviewID": "R1WSIMX3B3G7IM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking for a simple phone without all of the bells and whistles.  The Samsung A 197 pretty much qualifies.  As I use a prepaid plan w/o any data options there are a lot of features to this phone I would never use, but they are there for those who want them.Pros:  The hinges for the clam shell design are solid.  Standby time is acceptable, but not really anything special.  Sound quality and voice quality are good.Cons:  Hands free options are Blue Tooth or Samsung's own ear bud/microphone system.  As the connection is a micro USB, other ear bud connectors are not going to work.  The speaker phone is total crap.  With speaker volume as high as it will go, it is almost impossible to hear the person on the other end.  Pretty much limits the hands free options to Blue Tooth.I did receive the $15 airtime credit and there was absolutely no problems with using A T & T's online setup.  The airtime credit is 90 days instead of the normal 30 days for that amount of money.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "An Old Fogey Buys His First Cell Phone", "Author": "jerry i h", "ReviewID": "R1RD5EJ3UB24L2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(OK, you can stop laughing now. To answer your next question, mid 50's. For the following, I keep saying `minutes', but of course I mean $$$, and how many minutes it gives you depends on the GoPhone plan you choose)The impetus for buying this was: I had forgotten how expensive a bunch of long distance phone calls cost over a landline. There was a family tragedy, and for the phone bills I racked up, I coulda bought several of these GoPhone thingies, so I finally decided to get one.For the rather modest price tag, compared to a 2 year contract, you get all the accessories you need plus free airtime, so I consider this to be a great deal and give it highest recommendation. I remind you, however, that this is an old school \"dumb\" phone.OUT OF THE BOXBesides the phone, you get a SIM card, battery, AC charger, and included minutes, so you are good to go right out of the box. I had never seen a SIM card before, so it took me a minute to figure out how to punch it out and insert it into the phone. The factory settings for the display were no good, so I had take the brightness and screen idle time and set them to max. The best part was the minutes: once the phone was charged, you call a number listed in the quick start guide, and in less than half an hour I got my first text message telling me my minutes were activated; how cool is that? ICYW, this text message was free.IT IS A CELL PHONEIt has number buttons, and call button, and an end call button (the latter 2 double as power on and off). If you are like me, you will ignore all the other functionalities (well, you might wanna figure out how to access the stored numbers function; also how to turn off the audible ring), since I find navigating through complicated menus with only 2 buttons to be really, really annoying.IGNORING THE FEATURESFor a budget phone and a budget calling plan, you get access to a surprising number of advanced features: WAP, Apps, and email, all designed, of course, to burn through your minutes. I have ignored these, and cannot tell you anything about them. I also ignore the texting function, since I find creating letters with a numeric keypad as tedious and fiddly (yes, I know: teenagers can do this with patience and aplomb, besides being much faster than me).CAMERAThe only feature I appreciate is the integral VGA camera, mainly because it is a dedicated keyboard button and is therefore easy to access. You take pictures, which are stored in the non-volatile memory (no, I have no idea how many pictures it can store); if it is a particularly good one, you can set it as wallpaper. They display just fine on the screen. There are no external cards or plugs, so the only way to get pictures out of the phone is to email it to yourself; I have not done this yet, so cannot tell you how the pictures look on a regular computer screen.AIIIEEE...AT&T; COVERAGEAlthough I live in a major metropolitan market (SF/Bay Area), I have already experienced my share of dropped calls and/or not enough bars. So, if reliable coverage is important to you, I suggest you look for a phone with Verizon coverage.10\u00a2 A MINUTEI make some phone calls, but they are usually very short, so I chose this option: for my use, it is just as cheap as the old calling cards. If you are a heavy user, there is also a $2 per day GoPhone option, which gives you unlimited airtime for one day; if you can manage to stay off the phone for a day, you do not get charged for that day, a much better deal than your typical 2 year cell contract.There is also one quirk you need to know: the minutes expire. Every time you finish a call, you get a message about how many minutes you have left and when they expire, so if you use it regularly, this is not a problem.IS IT TOUGH AND DURABLE?For me, this will never be an issue. It spends most of its life on a table next the landline phone for use for long distance calls (I use it so infrequently, I have never had to recharge it beyond the initial charge I gave it when I first opened the box). I do not take it with me every day when I leave the house. I do take it with me, but only once it in a while.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good value", "Author": "dutchybunny", "ReviewID": "R17I3ZH0YMWQ88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because I needed a Bluetooth compatible phone.  The phone is compatible with the Bluetooth in my car.  I have not tried it with an ear bud.  The phone is simple to use and has all the basic features of a cell phone.

I use a Plantranics noise-cancelling Bluetooth headset. My carrier is ATT. The sound quality is excellent both incoming and outgoing, either though the headset or via the handset or speakerphone function. The phone may be inexpensive but it is what it is - a phone. Without all the bells and whistles that clog up a smartphone, this device does what it is supposed to and does it well. I bought two more as spares in case they every get discountinued. I do carry and use a smartphone for email and the web - but on calls, it is horrid and so I use this. Other people have said the call quality is not so great or it is cheap. I disagree. I carry this 24 hours a day, in all kinds of weather and conditions and it has never failed. And the battery life - long long long. 6 hours easily, sometimes more.

This phone is good for calls and text, that's it. If you want more features then your going to have to get a smart phone. This is a good basic phone, I can't stress that enough. My only complaint is that when you get picture messages you can't save the pics. I think AT&T; did this on intentionally because it is a pay as you go phone. Over all it's a great phone, my only gripe is that you can't save pics from picture messaging.

I only wanted a cell phone for emergencies.  I'm not a big talker and do not have a need or desire to have a phone in my hands or at my ear all the time.  I do have health issues and wanted a cell phone to have with me on the road and so that my children could contact me anytime/place.I did the research and decided that this would be the most cost efficient phone for my needs.  As shown on the product page the included airtime was to be added to the phone upon activation.  I immediately went online and activated the phone upon receipt.  I was assigned a phone number and gave it to my family.  I charged the phone and placed in my purse almost forgetting that I had it.  After being told several times, by people who tried to call, that the calls were not going through I attempted to place a call.  The phone didn't work.  I received a couple of \"Free\" emails from AT&T; but no calls would go out or come through.  I signed in to my account and saw that my airtime balance was $0.00.  I contacted AT&T; after 7+ days of waiting to find out why the $15.00 airtime credit hadn't been applied.  AT&T; customer service couldn't or wouldn't provide an answer or the promised airtime-they just kept referring me to some other number or department.
