{"Reviews": [{"Title": "AWESOME First Phone for YOUNGER Kids!", "Author": "jus2cusmile", "ReviewID": "R29VSYEA47HEQ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow, way too much negtivity with reviews based on things about this phone that aren't even true.(mostly by kids who don't even own this phone)THIS phone IS AWESOME for children ages 7-12, especially as a FIRST cell phone. It PURPOSLY DOESN'T HAVE a keypad because we all know how kids tend to run up ridiculous text messaging charges with their cell phones.THIS phone is geared towards younger children and not even meant for teens.It doesn't ONLY allow kids to 'call home' either, as some reviewers have stated. There are dedicated buttons for both mom & dad's #'s, one for 911/emergency and space for 22 other numbers in the phone book! I know, that as a mom, my 11 year old daughter doesn't NEED more that the amount of numbers it allows. PLUS, yes, the parents use a pin # and CAN control the numbers their child can call-BUT its not MANDATORY that a parent control the pin #! lol I trust my 11 year old enough, that she KNOWS the number I choose and she can add another phone number if she wants.My daughter just LOVES her phone and its a shame that some 'spoiled' kids nowadays feel they have to have a cellphone with all the bells and whistles-which wind up costing mom and dad a fortune in un-necessary charges. A younger child aged, 7-12 does NOT need anything more than this GREAT lil Phone offers!NOR, has my dughter EVER been laughed at by friends/schoolmates for having her Firefly phone. On the contrary, they have all said how 'cool' it is and a few have even gotten their own already as a result of seeing hers!lol(or plan to in the near future)The minutes are fair and each refill of a $25.00 card gets you 120 minutes which are valid for 90 days. For my child and children in her age group, its the PERFECT PHONE!", "Date": "September 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good starter phone for the younger set", "Author": "Meryl K. Evans \"Content Maven behind meryl.net\"", "ReviewID": "R3NGL2CM16T8FO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The target market for this phone is kids ages 8 to 12, although I recommend it more for the younger half of the group. 6 and 7-year-olds might be able to use it depending on the child.We know how kids are reckless about making and receiving too many phone calls. Firefly lets parents control who they call. The phone comes with a PIN so parents can program the phone and kids can't change it unless they figure out the PIN. The female button is typically the button for calling mom. The other one for calling dad. I programmed it so the female calls home and male calls Dad's cell phone.The address book only shows phone numbers for the people that the parents entered into the phone. The child also can't view his phone number, so it's possible to make it a one-way phone (calling out). I am comfortable with technology and I couldn't figure out how to program it without reading the instructions and this is a rarity for me.But it's easy to do once you get it figured out... a little tedious as there are no numbers on the phone. But that keeps it very lightweight. Besides, once you've entered the acceptable phone numbers -- you won't need to deal with entering phone numbers again except to add someone new.It might be a good phone for my 6.5-year-old because it would let him get in touch with us should anything happen. For my 11-year-old, I far prefer her sidekick since she can type to me (I'm hearing impaired) and besides -- it's better letting her get calls from friends on her own phone so she doesn't take up our phone line.This comes in multiple colors. I read some kid reviews who said it was an ugly phone. I think the male / female icons should be something else. But it's a simple phone -- how can it be ugly? When I was in the paging business, jellybean pagers (similar to the Firefly phone -- oval, different colors) were a hit with kids. So I can't imagine the issues with the looks.It also has a useless, but cute and fun feature where you push a button and it does fireworks -- the phone lights up, makes music, and shows a cartoon in the screen. It will probably get old fast even though there are about five different choices. You can also program the keys to have different colors in the screen. Kids like that stuff.All in all... it's a good starter for the younger set. Nothing fancy. Give it about 3 to 3.5 stars.", "Date": "October 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Parent peace of mind is worth it", "Author": "J. Sohn", "ReviewID": "R3OSP2LBU2D21H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm here because I'm going to buy this phone for my 7 & 9 year old daughters. Yes, $99 is a lot to spend on a phone. But you know what, right now I don't care. We just moved to a new neighborhood and my 9 year old got off at the wrong bus stop on Friday. The bus was early so I had no idea what happened. She wandered around for a while, scared and upset until a neighbor found her and brought her home. She was blocks away. My daughter has some communication issues but at least she had the good sense to recite her address so someone could help her. Over dinner tonight, my daughter suggested that if she had the Firefly phone she could call me if she got lost. She's absolutely right. I don't care what it looks like. I don't care how \"cool\" it is. I only care about the fact that she can reach me in an emergency and I can control the phone calls that she makes and receives. She's only 9 (and her sister is 7) and they're both way too young for a \"regular\" phone. The peace of mind a device like this affords is worth it.", "Date": "September 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Idea!!!!", "Author": "CT \"teed-off3\"", "ReviewID": "RP1X0DY5O04O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is a great idea for the kids. Yeah it is a bit expensive and you could give your kids a regular cell phone and buy minutes or add them on to your plan for about $10.00 a month extra with most companies BUT they also will have FULL use to call ANYONE, anytime they want! This way they are limited to the numbers you program in (and also 911 access in an emergency-which all kids should know) so you do not have to worry whether or not they have been on the regular cell phone with their friends, for hours, burning up the minutes. Then YOU wind up with a huge bill! This phone is also a bit more rugged than \"adult\" cell phones. My son is 11 and he LOVES it! ALL his friends think it is cool and want one now too! He has yet to find one kid he knows that thinks it is not cool. I would reccommend this to any parent.", "Date": "August 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Parents Beware, Minutes expire and Phone DE-ACTIVATES.", "Author": "I. Noble", "ReviewID": "R3ANIELVOKE0VN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my (10 year old) kid and added $100.00 worth of minutes. During summer vacation, she kept it on a shelf and never used it. When school started up again, she turned it on and to our chagrin found out that it says it only has limited service. I called Firefly customer service and a very bubbly representative (until I questioned this practice, that is) told me that after 90 days, the minutes expire unless you keep on adding minutes. 30 days after that, the phone de-activates and requires a payment of $25.00 to re-activate. Sim card is sent by mail.I personally think that this is a shabby practice, especially since this information is buried in their web-site.Good Luck with this phone!", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "great i love it", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3F5643ADUVYCA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i just got this phone exept i got mine from target stores . i love it. if i were a parent i would buy them one the only thing is 100 dollars but o well i still like it!", "Date": "July 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "Peace of mind for parents", "Author": "Linda Haigh", "ReviewID": "R1LUTW027YXSSH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This new phone called the \"Firefly\" is the absolute cutest thing I've seen.  It's small enough to fit just about anywhere from a backpack to a pocket, and it's just the thing I've been looking for.  I have very active kids (as most people these days do) and I'm never quite at ease when they leave my side because that would mean that I'm not there if they need me (which is probably more of a problem for me than it is for them).  This new phone is perfect for the younger kids, 8-12, who just aren't ready for the freedom of a standard cell phone, but they still have the ability to make and receive calls from the people I program into their phone.  All I know is that this is the \"comfort zone\" I've been needing so that I know my kids can reach me in the event that they might actually need me.  And, with Christmas rapidly approaching, I can tell you what's going to be under a lot of their friend's trees this year.  I'm already getting calls from other parents asking what their kids are all talking about.

The price was right and it was safe enough for my 11 year old. I had no qualms with the product or the service.  Then after a few months of not being used the display showed \"limited service\".  After calling Firefly I was informed that the minutes had expired and they had cancelled our service!!  I didn't know the minutes would expire or that I had to keep refilling the minutes. It didn't say that in any of the paperwork that came with the phone.  The representative told me that at the bottom of the registration card it says to go online for terms of services and that this information is listed there.  Why don't they put this information with the phone??  What about people who don't have internet service? I thought that was very sneaky.  Now, for me to get the phone reactivated it will cost me $25, I will have to purchase more minutes (none are included and the $50 worth I already paid for are expired) and a new phone number will be issued.  It will be cheaper to buy a whole new phone.  The product was okay, but the hard to find terms and conditions make me unwilling to buy into this product again.", "Date": "December 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great phone...", "Author": "Mo", "ReviewID": "R3AZ4IURS2G7BU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this phone and think it's a great idea.  What if your kid is at soccer practice and it ends early he/she can call home and say mom/dad pick me up practice ended early.  It allows you to program the phone for easy calls to Mom, Dad and 20 other people you add to the phone book.  You can also set the phone to receive calls only from the people in the address book OR you can set it so it can receive calls from anyone (parents choice).  I think this phone is aimed more at kids around 7-10/11. It also has an emergencies 911 button on the right hand side (you need to hold the button for 3 sec. then press the green phone symbol on the phone to place the call).  I think it's generally a good idea... i.e. if your child stays over a friends house and wants to call home...  your child is on a school bus and the bus gets stuck somewhere he/she can call you and let you know they are ok and theres a problem with the bus... I would recommend to anyone who has a child in that age range", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Easy to navigate. Easy to use. Easy to activate.", "Author": "Tabatha C.", "ReviewID": "R16DTYH1JCAAJI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my son and gave it to him today for his 7th birthday. I read some other reviews and was concerned because they said the numbers are hard to program. I didn't feel it was hard AT ALL. It shows you how right in the user's manual. You do have to use the call and end buttons to scroll through the letters and numbers, but wouldn't you expect to have to do some scrolling on a phone that has no letters or numbers? All in all it took less than 30 minutes to program mom, dad, and the other numbers he would need into his phone book. I was concerned about the (MANY) negative reviews as well about how hard it was to add minutes to the phone and how irritating it was that they expire and if the phone isn't used Firefly will disconnect your phone number. Well, our phone carrier (AT&T; - which used to be Cingular) used to sell this phone but doesn't anymore. I took it to my local AT&T; store and asked if we could add it to a family plan and they did it with no problems. That said, if you have AT&T; as your cell carrier you shouldn't have to worry about minutes AT ALL. It was only $26 to activate it and it's 9.99/mo for him to be on our phone plan. Viola! Minutes fiasco avoided. He has now used it several times to call numbers I put in the phone for him to \"brag\" about his new phone. I would DEFINATELY recommend this phone to others as a first phone for their child. I feel very safe knowing that he can call me whenever he wants AND I don't have to worry about who's calling him because of the parental controls. It was very easy for me to set up and seems to be equally as easy for him to use. We haven't had the phone very long, but the \"problems\" other people have said they had with this phone I certainly didn't have. This is, in my book, an A+ product designed for KIDS.

The phone is easy to use and is small enough to go into my son's pockets but......the service area coverage stinks! We can be standing in front of each other and I can call him on a land line and the phone does not ring.  On a rare occasion the call goes through.  If there is a problem be prepared to hold on the phone for customer service for at least twenty minutes.  The web site is hard to navigate through and it does not answer many questions unless you are willing to email them and wait for them to email back.  There is no warning when minutes are used for the month.  All in all it is just not worth the hassle.
