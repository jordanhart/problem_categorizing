This phone has gone through rain, snow, hot and cold and never failed me.  I'm even on the orignal battery and get about a week and a half of use on each charge.  If there is a weak spot on this phone it is the rubber but do not let that mislead you into thinking without it it is any less tough.  I have dropped the phone from a ladder, had it bounce across the sidewalk and it still keeps on going.  Not having a camera was a plus for me because some areas I go to they are not allowed and so I don't have to drop off the phone.  I absolutely recommend this phone for anyone who is working in harsh environments or even better are like me who ride motorcycles in all weather and just don't want their phone to fail just because it rained and they got soaked.  Once you have the mapping of the features set up to your liking, this phone is a fire and forget tool you will wonder how you got along without it before.  If you're looking for something to spend all day surfing the internet, this is not your phone but if you are looking for a PHONE and need to do some texting, you will find nothing sturdier or reliable.  In case you can't tell I love this phone.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "18th century", "Author": "Silverlaker", "ReviewID": "R21Y5ENR8Q1DHQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The keypad locks during all calls. Not an option. So you can check voicemail but you can't delete, skip or save messages. You can't call the bank, pay bills, call into work because you can't maneuver a menu. End of story. I can't tell you any positive or other negative things about it because I sent it right back. Oh, it's impossible to not hit the AT&T; navigator button. It is right in the middle.it's a terrible map and it's ten dollar per month feature, designed to make you purchase it by mistake.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great replacement for the Tundra", "Author": "Johnny Mac", "ReviewID": "R39OLOS0WT2TYF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Auto Parts store uses push-to-talk and GPS.
