{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Almost Perfect...", "Author": "D. Pearlman", "ReviewID": "R2FBEAC7FVXV3U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've now come to the conclusion that everybody who wrote reviews on the phone spent about five minutes with the device. Part of me doesn't blame them. If I reviewed electronics for a living, I wouldn't want to spend several days really testing the phone. However, with a cell phone as radically different as the Storm, it is unfair to make these judgments on the keyboard, etc. in haste.Simply put, the phone is very good. It isn't as breathtaking as I wanted it to be, however it is not nearly as disappointing as many critics want you to think (**cough** New York Times, excuse me). The keyboard is getting easier and easier to use as time goes by. If RIM put a tracker ball at the bottom of the phone where it is on all the other units, then this would in fact be, an iPhone killer. When I look at the phone, there is definitely room for that magical RIM trackball...(can you say Storm2?)Starting from the top. The phone feels solidly built. It has a good weight to it and feels durable. My only fear is that my propensity for dropping phones will be disastrous for the glass click screen. I'm having bad thoughts about not being able to do anything with the phone because the click activator ceases to work or I'll scratch up that beautiful screen. Three times in the last seven years or so I've had the misfortune of waking up from a night of drinking only to find giant cracks on the LCDs of my phones (can you say insurance? iPhone people can't, and that alone will FOREVER stop me from getting one). Seriously though, I really hope this thing is bomb proof. I have a silicon condom on it, which better keep it safe at night.I was perplexed when I powered it on for the first time. The phone takes several minutes to reboot. This is a laptop, not a phone, right? Thankfully I only have to reset the phone every so often... Pretty is a good word to describe the design and graphics overall.The click screen is a trip. It is definitely takes adjustment, but I really dig it. It definitely limits the speed of your typing because you must remain in line with the speed of \"The Cadence of the Clicker\" (this is the name of my next album). I say that because when you are really going at it, it can create a steady beat like a metronome. This just feels like one of the drawbacks to writing novels on any mobile device. All keyboards have a handicap, but I sincerely miss being able to press to multiple buttons at the almost exact time (as we are accustomed to on a computer keyboard). This system causes you to be a little more accurate because you can't barrel through your letters, so it may be a bonus after all. I also like the SureType keyboard in portrait mode. It uses the predictive text heavily, and it is a great fast type option with one thumb. This mode suffers most from the click limiter because the surface area is far too tight for dual finger typing as tempting as it is.One of my friends voiced his displeasure with the auto correct function on the text. I find it useful. Just remember if it auto corrects something and you don't like it, immediately hit the DELETE button, and it will revert to your perverted word or innocent typo. His changed the word \"f*&^ing\" into \"ducking.\" The best way around this is to add these words that you use when frustrated or talking dirty to your lover into the Dictionary. To do so, go to the HOME screen, then choose: OPTIONS-CUSTOM DICTIONARY. Now hit the BlackBerry button and select NEW.I've also heard that the VZNavigator and Visual Voicemail programs should be removed to speed up the performance of the phone. After all, who is going to pay $10 and $3/month for such frivolous features? What I was jazzed to see is that Google Maps' triangulation feature was not disabled here as it was on my i760 and Treo. This means that it will show your approximate location on the map for free. It is a nice feature to get you partially orientated at no cost (just keep in mind it is using cell towers to locate you, so you must have service for it to work, which is not the case with true GPS/VZNav).The media player is good. It is not an iPod, but it has a great search feature, and is intuitively laid out. The resolution on the screen is better than the iPhone and video looks GREAT. The included headphones sound great and the speakerphone gets extremely loud, however it is very tinny sounding and has an over modulated feel when at high volumes.The icing on the cake is that I am not utilizing the BlackBerry Corporate server, therefore, I do not have to pay for BlackBerry data access. I am now paying only $29.99 for data where I was paying $44.99 on my Samsung for the exact same unlimited data/email service. With this savings, my Storm will pay for itself in 14 months of service!The device lock is good. You can either hit the button on the top left of the phone, or you can use the \"Lock\" button in your home menu. I'm peeved at how the Mute/un-Mute button still functions while the device is locked. I've had the phone suddenly start playing \"Rise Against\" over the speakerphone (which can get pretty damn loud) at times that I wished it hadn't. I understand that it is to let you control your music without unlocking the device, however I always saw locking as the way to prevent your phone from doing strange things in the privacy of your pocket/holster without your permission. FIX: just lower your media playback volume all the way to silent.The ringer alerts are one of the best features on the phone. I can't be happier in this department. This puts every phone I've ever seen to shame (I don't know if all BBs do this, this is my first). You can select from a plethora of options including: Normal, Loud, Medium, Vibrate Only, Silent, All Alerts Off, and my personal favorite Phone Calls Only (all with the touch of a button). I'm used to an all or nothing world, or having to go into individual menus and make these decisions (time consuming/annoying? Yes). Furthermore, the alarm will sound in any mode other than All Alerts Off.Where the Storm crushes the iPhone is in the folder organization possibilities on the home page. Where the iPhone only allows you to move your applications around, the Storm lets you create folders to keep everything organized as if it were a computer desktop. I absolutely love this ability because I'm very big at keeping things `tidy.'I'm also a fan of how the screen fades down instead of cutting out when it is time to turn off. This is great because it reminds you that you have to do something to the device if you don't want the image to go away completely.Some tips:To get IMAP to work with GMAIL, follow the instructions here: [...]Don't waste your time like I did, just go directly to this website as per the forums instructions: [...]I was concerned that there was a charge to using this service (because I'm not utilizing Verizon's BlackBerry email service), but there isn't.To copy and paste, you simply hold down one finger where you want to start, and then drag along with another to where you want it to end.When entering text, if you spell something so terribly wrong that its suggestions aren't helpful, then the best thing to do is just delete the entire word. This is frustrating. It doesn't allow you to fix your mistake because when you click on a part of the word it makes you chose from the suggested list. I wish there were a way around this. Nevertheless, if you just give up, then you can move on without losing any more hair.I can't properly sync my phone with my Mac given the software they include and the USB cable. However, thanks to Google's amazing Sync application, I do all of my syncing wirelessly as often as I wish.

Brusco \"Sam Brusco\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q32BKL0LONYS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "May 4, 2010 I have a love-hate relationship with my Verizon Blackberry Storm 1.In April 2010, I bought and returned an iPhone from AT&T; and a Sprint Google Android phone from Samsung.  I also tried out the BlackBerry Storm 2.  My story unfolds...When the antenna on my BB Storm 1 stopped working, my first instinct was to get the Storm 2 from Verizon as a replacement.  I checked it out and I was unimpressed.  Not much new there, except that it is now Wi-Fi capable.  Now, you would think that Verizon Wireless would set up a simple wireless router at their showrooms to show just how fast their phones are, but Verizon is not that smart.  Anyway, the Storm 2 is just as pathetic as the Storm 1 when it comes to internet browsing over the network.  It's so bad that the Attorneys General of the US should sue them for false advertising.  Verizon calls it high-speed internet, but it truly is the speed of dial-up.  Remember dial-up?  56K?  It takes 30 to 90 seconds to load an average web page.  At least it does in the Providence area.  And around here, the phone coverage sucks too.  At times, I have 5 bars, sometimes I have 3, sometimes no signal at all, and that's all without leaving my house.I decided to try the iPhone 3Gs and go over to the Dark Side.  I LOVED IT!  The browser is phenomenal and FAST!  Almost as fast as my home computer, whether I was using Wi-Fi or in the car.  The phone is much easier to use than the BlackBerry.  The signal was ALWAYS 5 bars... EVERYWHERE, even in the hills of Connecticut where my wife's old Verizon phone had maybe 1 bar.  Worked great in San Francisco too.  But this story does not have a happy ending.  The iPhone went back 29 days later.Although everything about the iPhone gets an A or A+, its calendar reminder system gets a big fat F!  I almost missed a class, and I was teaching the class!!  The iPhone only tells you about an appointment once.  Then you're on your own.  I need to be reminded 5 hours out, 2 hours out, 30 minutes out and then every 5 minutes after that, until I say \"Dismissed\".  I looked into fixes and other possibilities.  I called AT&T; and Apple support and went to the AT&T; and Apple stores.  Everyone looked at me as if to say \"Dude, this is the best phone in the world, your A.D.D. is not the iPhone's problem.\"  One woman told me to set multiple appointments so I would be reminded adequately.  My reply was \"You want me to clutter my calendar because the iPhone does a terrible job of reminding me of stuff I have to do?\"  And every person I asked said \"Well, I'm sure there's an app for that.\"  The cop-out mantra of iPhone support \"There's an app for that.\"  No, there isn't!  Well, not unless you call getting sent emails and text messages or an entirely separate reminder app a good solution.  Beyond frustrated, I Googled and started reading the forums.  I learned that Apple did not open the SDK (the iPhone's architecture) for 3rd party developers.  No adequate fix exists for this problem, and apparently it's not even on Apple's radar.  In May 2010, they are releasing a major upgrade to the software and snoozing is not part of it.  Below I complain that the BlackBerry's task and appointment reminders can only snooze a set amount of time.  Oh ma Gah!  This is heaven compared to the iPhone.My other gripe about the iPhone was that it can only do one thing at a time... literally.  It's not multi-tasking.  If you are listening to Slacker Radio and you get a call or you go to a web page, the iPhone closes the application.  When you go back, you start over.  The upside is you don't have the nasty memory problems that the Storm used to have, but this was Apple's best idea???  Wow, big brain trust there.iPhone doesn't have a flash for the camera.  If you know anything about photography, you know the more light the better.  Pictures without a flash indoors will be dark and/or grainy, even if you edit them after the fact.Typing on the iPhone was okay, but merely okay.I have heard that AT&T; phone and data coverage is bad in major cities.  A lot of young people live in big cities and they all have iPhones, thus the systems are overloaded.So, to summarize, if you want to be entertained, take photos in broad daylight, and use social media all day long, get an iPhone.  If you have actual responsibilities or have A.D.D like me, and you need a true PDA (personal digital assistant), stick with a BlackBerry... any BlackBerry.  The iPhone grew out of the iPod -- an entertainment device -- and then they added a phone.  BlackBerries started out as business devices and have added entertainment for those rare occasions that business people don't have something else they should be doing.  God, I sound old!Oh, by the way, when people at AT&T; say \"try the iPhone free for 30 days\", they don't mean it.  I had to pay a $35 restocking fee AND I had to pay for almost 30 days of phone service.  The 2-year contract did not kick in though.Onto the Android.  I tried the Samsung Moment.  Its reminder feature was weak.  I mean that literally.  I didn't hear it.  And a bumble bee 10 feet away vibrates my pocket more that that phone.  And the Android cannot snooze a task or appointment either, but you can set multiple (I don't know how many) reminders in the calendar appointment, not that you'll hear or feel any of them when they go off.Oh, and you need to have Google Mail and Calendar to even try the calendar.  If I could have checked out reminders in the store, I would have known right away that the Android was not for me.  Regular Yahoo Mail accounts do not work with Android at this time.  I didn't even try my work email.The phone functionality of the Android was slow and not well thought out (long story short).  Google needs to fix that immediately.Typing on the Samsung Moment was okay, but merely okay.  I may have gotten used to its slide-out keyboard, but I didn't keep it that long.Sprint's network speed was half of what AT&T;'s is in Providence and San Francisco.  (I live in RI and traveled to San Fran while I had the phone.)  Luckily, Sprint's policy is now not to charge a dime if you bring it back within 30 days, but they would not take back the overpriced $40 phone protector.To wrap up this comparison of the 4 phones, I don't think the BlackBerry Storm 1 is perfect, but it still does most of the things I need it to do and it does those things well enough.  Oh, by some stroke of luck, my phone started working again 6 weeks later, so I'm sticking with the Storm 1 for now.  If someone knows of a good phone/PDA/push email device that works better, please email me!There's more details about the BlackBerry Storm 1 below.----------------------------A January 2010 update to the updates below.#4 Desktop Manager 5.0.1.28 works well with Outlook 2007 on Windows 7.In January 2010, I bought a new computer with Windows 7.  I got a great deal on Microsoft Office 2007, so I installed the new Office.  Well, that combination didn't work so well with my ol' reliable BlackBerry Desktop Manager 4.2.2.14.  I decided to upgrade to the latest version of BlackBerry Desktop Manager (something I said I would never do).  It all works very well together.  I was previously running Windows XP and Office 2000.----------------------------This is a Dec 2009 update to my April 2009 review of the Storm 1 (this is not a review of the Storm 2).  The numbers refer to my April 2009 criticisms (below the dotted line).summary: much better since 5.0 operating system released in Oct 2009#1 The Storm 1 was greatly improved when BlackBerry released the 5.0 operating system.  Now I'd have to give the Storm 4 out of 5 stars.#1B Those sub-second connections to internet pages that they show in the commercials... are still a big fat lie!  To call the connection \"broadband\" is a complete deception perpetrated by Verizon.  This is approximately dialup speed minus the wheezing and hissing of a modem.  That said, I absolutely love that I can connect to the internet almost anytime/anyplace.#2 To mitigate the fat-fingering problems I was having with the full QWERTY keyboard in landscape mode, I have been using the SureType keyboard in portrait mode.  It's a QWERTY keyboard in 3 rows x 5 columns.  What makes it quick and effective is that the Storm starts suggesting words to select after typing in a few letters of the word.  I can single-thumb or double-thumb most everything now.  To change the keyboard default to SureType, in the options (the wrench icon), choose Screen/Keyboard, then change the Portrait View Keyboard to SureType.#3 hasn't changed.  In April, I forgot to mention that in order to get turn by turn spoken directions, you have to pay Verizon a $10 ransom per month or buy software from Garmin for $100.  You can use BlackBerry Maps or Google Maps for free, but it doesn't talk to you.#4 Synchronization works well with Desktop Manager 4.2.2.14 (released April 26, 2007).  It doesn't have the niceties that the current release has, but it actually works, unlike more recent releases.  On several occasions, I spent an entire DAY upgrading to \"the latest and greatest\" only to have to uninstall it and then install 4.2 again.  This happened more than once on the advice of Verizon technicians who don't know nearly as much as the RIM techs.  I will be using Desktop Manager 4.2 until the day this phone dies.  Fool me once, shame on Verizon.  Fool me twice (and then a third time), shame on me.  There will be no fourth time.#5 phrase selection has been vastly improved, but still isn't great.  It would be really helpful if double-clicking would highlight a word.  And apparently BlackBerry is completely unfamiliar with the concept of \"undo\".  If you delete some text, well that's just too bad.  You can \"discard\" all the changes you've made since last saving or you can retype what you just blasted, if you can remember what it was.#6 I hope BlackBerry changed the location of the micro-SD card for the Storm 2, because its placement on the Storm 1 was just plain stupid.  You remember that board game \"Operation\" by Milton Bradley?  It's like that.  \"Take out memory card.\"  Bzzzzz!#7 still a problem but they've made a half-hearted attempt of making the number pad easier to get to.  If they made the number pad smaller and put the function buttons all in one smaller row, that way everything is available on one screen, it would be truly appreciated.#8 there's only one pre-set choice for a \"snooze\".  Honestly RIM, this is inexcusable.  Do something about this!#9 Actually voice recognition for contacts is quite easy to use.  The button on the left of the phone is set up to do this as a default.  Speak the name and choose from a few possibilities.#10 The \"can you hear me now?\" geek from Verizon still has not been to my house to improve coverage at my place of residence.  I am moving soon and if the coverage sucks at that house too, I will be shelling over another $250 to Verizon to fill in the gap in their network.  Hey Verizon, can you hear this?  [I'm making a gesture.]  But in Verizon's (or \"VZ\" to be cool because apparently teenagers can't spell anything these days, nor be bothered to call something by its given name if it is greater than 3 letters long)... [Where was I?  Oh, yeah.]  In Verizon's defense, their network beats AT&T;'s coverage hands down;  people who have the i-Phone constantly complain that they can't make calls and calls are dropped.One more thing, I've discovered that the Storm makes a very handy flashlight.  No, I'm not joking.  If you open the Video Camera application, the LED light (the flash) on the back of the phone comes on and stays on.  It is bright!In summary, if the devil is in the details, this device is now a little mischievous.  Theoretically, this is still the best phone available, except perhaps for the Storm 2 (which I assume is better than Storm 1).  I no longer wish I still had that old, big, clunky, reliable and easy-to-use, brick-sized HP IPAQ.-------- original review from April 2009 -----------------------------If this phone worked the way it was supposed to, there would be no reason to even consider any other phone.  It has everything:  phone, PDA, 3G web browser, multi-media player, sleek look, a 16GB expansion card (comes with an 8GB card), 3.2 mega-pixel camera WITH A FLASH, voice dialing, a big hi-res screen, email that gets pushed to your Storm, so you don't have to log on to check your mail!!Then why am I already wishing I had returned it during the grace period?  I had an HP IPAQ H6315 for 4 years which was way better than this, but it didn't have all the bells and whistles, so I got the Storm.#1 it's painfully slow.  Those sub-second connections to internet pages that they show in the commercials... in your dreams!!  Even opening and closing applications makes me want to slap it upside the head to get its attention.#2 the on-screen QWERTY keypad is difficult to use for anyone with adult-size thumbs.  I am constantly fat-fingering letters.#3 Although it does have a GPS antenna built into it, it relies on the data network to show you the map and give you directions.  No reception, no map.  Again, it's painfully slow.#4 Synchronization has been a problem since I got the phone 8 weeks ago. I wrote many, many notes to myself over the weekend while at a conference.  This morning when I synchronized with my pc, they all disappeared.#5 Editing on the Storm is nearly impossible.  I still haven't figured out how to highlight words (double-click doesn't work, nor does click and drag)#6 In all their wisdom, Blackberry made the micro-SD nearly inaccessible.  Most devices that use cards have them on the side, so you can swap them in and out without a big fuss.  Oh no, not Blackberry, they put it deep inside this device.  Brilliant.#7 When you talk on the phone, your cheak will press buttons.  RIM also thought it would be a good idea to hide the number pad after the call connects.  Who wants to use the number pad during a call anyway??#8 When you get a reminder, there's only one pre-set choice for a \"snooze\".  If you want it to remind you an hour from now, sorry, you'll have to open the calendar item or task.  It will take you about 40 seconds to do so because of #1 and #2.#9 Forget about scrolling through your contacts or tasks.  That would take you forever.  You have to know what you're looking for and type in a few letters.  Now see #2.  Although in its defense, it does have voice recognition for contacts.  Of course I haven't had time to set this up yet (see #4).#10 And that \"can you hear me now?\" geek from Verizon has apparently never been to my house.  Although Verizon does have a device that essentially creates a mini cell tower in your house and then connects to Verizon through your hi-speed modem... for $250!!In summary, if the devil is in the details, this device must be evil.  From a detailed analysis of everything out there, this was the best phone available, because HP still had not put out a similar product.  I wish I had that old, big, clunky, reliable and easy-to-use, brick-sized IPAQ back.  When HP does put out an IPAQ with these features, I will absolutely buy it.(I bought this phone from Verizon, not from Amazon.)", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Blackberry lover- sadly saying goodbye...", "Author": "C. Cruz", "ReviewID": "R18MESX0JU5CM3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got an email from Verizon today.  It says I am eligible for my \"New every Two\".  I will have a nice new phone before the week is over.I got my first Blackberry (the Curve) two years ago.  I absolutely loved it!  I told my husband it would be the last phone I ever had (as he shook his head, yeah right).  But this review is not about the Curve, it is about the Storm- so here goes.When I saw all the commercials and ads for the Storm, I was excited, since the iPhone was not available to me as a Verizon customer (and I am a Mac user).  I researched and compared the two phones, and found they both had pros and cons of their own, but were fairly comparable depending on what you wanted it for.Last Mother's Day, my husband came home with a brand new Blackberry Storm for me- paying... (and please don't shake your heads and roll your eyes- IT WAS MY GIFT!)... paying FULL RETAIL PRICE for it.  Okay, so I thought of returning it... but I really was looking forward to using it, plus I was the only person I knew who had one!  I gave my Curve to my husband.  After the one month honeymoon of loving all the features and apps.... it takes great pictures and looks slick.... the honeymoon ended (of course it was also after the return window was no longer an option.)The first thing I realized I hated was if you were talking hands-free by resting the phone between your shoulder and ear, the screen would depress and either mute or put the other party on speaker.  I paid for an app to fix this (BerrySlider).  In August, less than 3 months after owning this phone, I would hit the green talk button and the camera would start up; I would hit the lock button on top and the camera would start up; I would dial \"one\" for voicemail and the camera would start up.  So I paid the 70 or so dollars for my \"copay\" under the warranty to have a new one sent to me.  Great!The new Storm worked great for about another month (although I still had the issue of not being able to rest the phone between my ear and shoulder, and I was getting tired of spending money on it, so I didn't repurchase the BerrySlider). Now my issue is that it freezes.  CONSTANTLY.  Let me repeat that.  CONSTANTLY.  It will work fine, then I'll get a phone call that I can't answer because I have the stupid ticking clock symbol in the middle of the screen.  Let me also say that I do update my phone when it calls for an update, not that I think it has helped! I clear my internet cache, cookies and history as well.I went into a Verizon store last month with a friend who was purchasing a new phone.  She needed her work email address, which I have stored in my contacts.  Guess what?  It froze when I tried to go to contacts.  I put my phone on the counter and told the rep it was the worst phone EVER.  He said I just had too many things on the screen, so he moved a bunch of apps (like Facebook, Amazon, [...], Maps, etc) to the Downloads folder.  Yeah, okay.  Guess what?  It seems to freeze even more now.  I am now at the point where I am pulling my battery out AT LEAST once a day.Would I recommend a Blackberry to anyone?  Definitely!  Would I recommend the Storm?  Not to my worst enemy.  If you don't believe me, check out the reviews on Verizon's own website.  There are only a few that gave good ratings, and many owned it from one day to less than a month.  I've put up with two of them in the past nine 1/2 months.As for my \"New Every Two\", I am probably going to go with the Motorola Droid.  I've owned Motorolas in the past and was not impressed, but it has great reviews, and I have a friend who has one and LOVES it, which says a lot to me. Hopefully, I will too!Pros:Sleek  Touchscreen (but nowadays, so many are!)  Pictures look great, especially on the big screen  The music player sounds really good  Lots of memory with the included 8mb mini SD cardCons: It freezes constantly  Typing is not easy.  I use landscape, which is easier, but it's still not great.  Software glitching a lot  Phone doesn't always ring, or freezes when you try to answerHopefully, this review helped. I'm a little sad to switch from Blackberry, plus their forums are great (Crackberry), but RIM, you lost me after the nightmare this Storm has been.

Nothing - nothing - works well on this device. The gyroscope is unresponsive. The touch interface is unresponsive. The actual buttons lag. The navigation is clumsy, ugly and inefficient at all levels - whether you're on the phone or trying to get to it. It keeps two records of everything with its catch-all \"Messages\" category, which causes you to spend absurd amounts of time picking through the notes deleting and keeping what you want.The system is glutted with bloatware. Worse, still, RIM keeps packing junk on to the phone whenever you are gullible enough to update it.Behold! I just looked and now have NFL Mobile and YouTube mobile. I did not ask for these things. Did not request them. Why do I have them? Because RIM believes that what I really want to do with my device is f' around when all I - like the vast majority of people - want to do is make phone calls and check my email reliably.As a result of its colossal, horrible, malevolent design, it is slow to respond to anything - except the alarm. That works fine. Shutting it off is a little trickier however, since the usability commandos over at RIM put all of the buttons right on top of one another.Powering down does not solve its problems. In fact, it takes some effort to get the device to even acknowledge that it has been given the command to power down. (Powering up is a bit of a mystery, too.) Pulling the battery out does not solve its problems.When I took the phone over to Verizon to have it examined by the sales rep who sold it to me, his comment was, \"Wow, yours works better than mine\" which is tantamount to saying, \"you think you've got it bad, my ED takes two Viagra to solve.\"In fact, the only way to solve this device's many problems is to buy something else.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "5-Stars...but be careful when buying to check a few things!", "Author": "Donald Brent \"dbrent\"", "ReviewID": "RWJ2B8U8LHMAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All in all I am VERY satisfied with this phone!

The first phone I bought had some kind of contaminant under the glass of the screen.  Phone#2 had a bad mic, Phone#3 had a problem \"clicking\" on one edge of the screen.  I'm on phone#4 currently and I think this one is a winner (knock wood).  I will say that Verizon switched out the phone each time, no questions asked and sincerely wanted me to be happy with my purchase.Minor complaints (not strong enough to deduct a Star):1. Music data (album name, artist, etc...) should be editable on the device, instead of just on windows before you transfer the song over.2. The data displayed while a song is playing does not appear to be configurable.3. Hoping for a 32gb SD card option although 16mb is probably fine.4. Agree with the previous review re:placement of the sd card.  It would have made more sense to put it on the outside somewhere to make it easier to swap out.Overall, I would highly recommend this phone and would advise that one just be picky to make sure your phone doesn't have any functional issues.Don", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Never worked proper", "Author": "Krista Louis \"Wokka\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZOKSU6ZBTK8C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone in May 2010 and it stopped working in Feb 2011.

The only reason I kept this phone rather than returning it for another is that I use verizon and can not get the I Phone.This phone has a screen that you first touch and then press to activate what you are touching.  I personally like that better than the I phone because I can be sure I am touching what I mean to be and then making the execution.  I also like the feel of pressing the keyboard down--especially when typing.  Some people prefer the I phone because it is faster.  One of the problems is that when you place a call and put the phone up to your cheek, you can easily press the screen changing it to speaker or mute or some unknown thing that takes awhile to reset before you can hear the call.  You can fix this by purchasing an application that locks the screen.  The storms lock feature will not lock the screen during a call so you have to purchase this after market application.  Another thing is that the keyboard is hidden when you place a call so if you need to put in your password/numbers you need to look at the phone, select the keyboard and it shows up.  It just isn't convenient or intuitive.Another extremely odd thing is that the phone turns off the signal all by itself, randomly.  If you don't look at the phone, you may not realize the signal is turned off (therefore you can't receive calls, emails, etc).  A software update is promised to fix this at some unknown time.  We purchased two Storms and both do this--a common problem according to verizon.  One of the phones does this about 1 time per day.  They other did it several times per day.  Verizon changed that storm out for a replacement storm.  So now, both phones turn themselves off only about 1 time per day.Software is glitchy when it comes to notifications.  You can turn all sound off or turn it off for each individual thing.  If you turn it off for each individual thing, sometimes it decides to make sound anyway.  According to verizon, there is no fix for this--other than a hard reboot that erases everything but doesn't guarantee a fix--and in fact, has never fixed ours.  So, if we don't want the phone to randomly decide to make noise, we have to turn all sound off.  Of course that includes the phone ring along with all the data rings.This phone is painfully slow, although I can not compare it to other blackberry's as I have not had one before.  I could not do real work on it.  Luckily, I am not a business user so there isn't anything that I can't put off until I can get to a computer.  I have tried looking at and editing word documents but have never had the patience to deal with it after waiting and waiting and waiting for them to load.  Likewise, using internet is painful.A plus to blackberry is that you can use blackberry messenger to IM any other blackberry user that you are connected to (free connection--you just both have to agree to it).  This saves money on texting because you don't have to add that feature or you can get a smaller texting package.  We use blackberry IM all the time and love it.I sync up my blackberry to my mac computer--when it agrees to do it.  Again, this seems like a random thing, although it works about 90% of the time.  There could be lots of improvements in this sync, however, I can sync my phonebook (without categories), calendar, and itunes.  I tunes is not as user friendly on this as the I Phone, however, if it isn't the main reason you have the phone, it is tolerable.  If you want to search songs and change playlists or get creative though, you won't want to do it on this phone.  The speakers on the phone have a very \"tinny\" sound if you try to play music through them.  It is annoying to me but I didn't buy the phone for good speakers so it isn't a big deal.The camera on the phone is fairly decent and has a flash.  Sometimes the flash washes out things too much--but again, I didn't buy this phone for the camera so it is fine for me.  Most of the pictures sync with i photo without a problem, although sometimes it says that they aren't recognizable.I love that it has a removable memory card.  It comes with 8 g but can be upgraded to 16.  Nice to only have to change a memory card rather than buying a whole new phone just to get more memory.There are not nearly as many apps for this as there are for I Phone and very few of them are free.  This may be fine for business users but it is frustrating for me.I love the look of the phone and the pre-loaded ring tones.  I also like the flexibility to move icons and put them in folders and customize the phone.This phone gets emails automatically and that is great.  No having to log in and check emails.The voice activated dialing works about 50% of the time without training.  I find myself not using this feature although there may be ways to customize it and make it work better.When the I phone comes to verizon I will replace this in a heartbeat.  Until then, I feel like this is better than nothing.  Although based on some reviews, I may be wrong--other blackberries may be better.  I am especially disappointed with how buggy this phone is and the promises of software fixes that never seem to come.  And this phone has been on the market for awhile.This is a buyer beware phone for sure.  It also falls into the category of \"settling\" until there is something better.UPDATE 7/26/09:  a new software update has fixed most, but not all of the problems.  The biggest problem that remains is that you can accidently click the phone while on a call which results in muting or other problems.  POCKMAC for syncing with mac remains an issue but RiM is suppose to come out with their own software in sept. and that may fix the problems.  If running facebook on your blackberry, you are more likely to encounter problems with the sync.  If you do, on your blackberry, go into options, advanced options, service book, and then delete facebook with the cical next to it and that should fix it.  However, sometimes you do have to go back and repeat the process.  I also noticed that on my new unibody macbook pro there are less issues with syncing than on my old macbook pro.  not sure why as it runs the same ox software.  but i am happy that it is finally syncing.  i do sync my itunes with my blackberry as well using pocketmac.on advantage to the blackberry over the iphone is that on the blackberry you can run multiple things at once.  so you could have your maps running directions, make a phone call, and return to maps without having to start over.  on the iphone you can't do that-at least that is what the apple store people told me.because of the improvements to the blackberry with the software upgrade, the fact that i can use it with verizon, and now pocketmac is working, i would choose the blackberry over the iphone if i had to do it over again.  if iphone comes to verizon, then i will have to make a decision.  if it still has the water vapor issue voiding the warranty, however, i will probably stay away from iphone until that is fixed.  (in case you aren't aware, the iphone can stop working just from being exposed to humidity and sweat and it is not covered under apple warranty--it is causing a lot of problems for people as of this date).UPDATE 7/27/09:  for some blackberrys, the software upgrade eventually crashes the system.  We own two blackberries, it did this to one of them.  tech support at verizon said that it needed to be replaced or it would keep crashing.  the person at tech support said that happened to hers and when she got the replacement she hasn't had a problem.  we are choosing to wait one more time to see if it crashes again (has done so twice in 1 week and you have to reboot the entire system, erasing everything on it).  verizon does replace the phone with a refurbushed one for free within the first year.  before you purchase one of these, check the replacement policy that your carrier has.", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Avoid Blackberry Storm at all costs", "Author": "J.

Not only was there no storm, there was a heat wave that came directly from my face as it exploded in disgust at my new purchase.I have had the storm for two years now, because thats how long Verizon makes you feel guilty about buying a load of crap before you can do it all over again. I am getting a the new Droid X next week, so I figured I might as well flatter you all with the truth on this device before I kick it to the curb to complain about the next one.The ScreenOMG OMG OMG the screen is a button!!! Has anyone realized the reason that no other phone has this feature is because it is not necessary? The one good thing that came out of this is that they made the screen just small enough that all the special pocket lint I love to save can store itself between the edge of the screen and body of the phone for safe keeping. I bought toothpicks for the first time not to clean my teeth...but to clear out space in my phone in order to store newer lint.Non-screen related buttonsSo I was walking around a small store one day when I hear one of my favorite songs come on the radio. I am singing along walking up to the cash register and I say to the guy who is staring at me like I just swallowed a doorknob, \"hey this is a great song, glad you guys play good music in your store\". Well he politely turns to me and says \"Hey Jacka$$, the music is playing from your pants\". This is officially the only time in my life that my phone has actively embarrassed me. See there is a button at the top of the phone that mutes your music...well it also plays your music, and of course the one thing they made right on the phone is the crazy loud speaker, so I quickly learned to keep no music on my phone. Just to add to the story, I also couldn't turn the music off right away because the only other button on the top is a screen lock, which sometimes worked and sometimes didn't so you have to mess with it.Front buttonsMy phone has a collection of buttons...let me rephrase. My phone has a collection of buttons that no longer are part of the phone. The four buttons on the front of the phone are just placed well enough to rip off when you stick your phone in your pocket. They did fix this on the storm two, but that came out lets see....two months after the first failure? At least if I bought an Iphone they may have replaced it for falling apart, and I would have enjoyed watching steve jobs blame his customers again for them improperly using his crappy product.Side buttons\"Say a command\"....\"say a command\"....get used to it, the phone says it all the time. One of the side buttons brings up the voice calling feature, but only brings it up when I am a) In class, b) trying to impress a lady with my thoughts on the bubonic plague, or c) Trying to sleep off a long night. Luckily you can change the button to do something else, I choose nothing, as I did with the other three side buttons. One button repeatedly took pictures of the inside of my pockets...which is cool but everyone stopped \"Liking\" them on facebook after I posted the first 100. The other controls the volume...or changes the song, whichever you aren't trying to accomplish it will do for you.OSTo first access the phone turn it on, and come back tomorrow when it has finished waking up. I clocked it, it takes 2 minutes for my computer to boot up, and 7 minutes for my blackberry, anyone else see an issue? I know that some people need to take it slow so they don't choke on any instant excitement, but I would rather take my chances. Once it is loaded and passed the \"Security Test\" that it always does, the phone turns on, and if you haven't broken the hardware yet you can begin playing with the OS. It is the basic blackberry os, nothing special, except this awesome new feature that if your hands are damp, or your sweating from blackberry induced phone frustration, when you go to choose a menu item...it decides that you must in fact be blind and that you really want the menu item on the other side of the screen. For me it seems to constantly choose the \"network\" option, I think this is RIM's way of telling you it is verizon's fault.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "piece of crap.

It has a touch screen interface including a touch screen keyboard that appears when needed.  That can be tricky to get used to but overall is a pretty snazzy feature.  The phone has several apps preloaded, I was able to get it to work with Gmail without any real trouble, and the phone has some neat features that are pretty standard for quality smartphones.Unfortunately, it has some serious cons.  It doesn't offer ways to quickly and cleanly shut down programs which leads often to the phone locking up.  You can't push one button to end a program, you have to click, scroll way down in a menu with several finger swipes, and then click close.  Imagine clicking-scrolling a lot-and clicking again four times in a row just because you want to go from email to the web to a text message and back to a phone call.  That's silly.  But if you don't meticulously \"close\" programs, the phone slows to a crawl and/or crashes.  Oh, and did I mention it often takes a few minutes to even turn on after a crash?The phone also gets poor service in areas where other simpler phones get great service.  I had trouble getting service all over NYC - seriously, a smartphone (on Verizon!) that has trouble in NYC?  That's not good.The phone also does strange things.  If you try to send a text message or other message while you have no service the phone often fails to ever send the message at all, even if you have all your bars.  I've literally watched it fail to send a simple text message for 10 minutes and then I copy and paste the unsent text into a new, fresh SMS and it immediately sends it with no difficulty.  That means the phone is being stupid.The Storm is a visually appealing phone with lots of cool features and a great touch screen.

At first I was really excited about it and then it started to get a little irritating. I've had it since a month or two after it came out.Pros:1. The calls come in clear. I've had problems before with other phones and the volume of the calls.2. The hold button works. No dialing random people in my purse.3. I really like having both of my email accounts on my phone. It updates pretty quickly and I like being able to delete emails from my phone and from my account.4. The pictures come out pretty great. I was actually surprised by it.5. The voice recognition is awesome. I tried it using my name (which is kind of difficult) and it picked it up on the first try. I also tried some names with silent letters and it also worked.Cons:1. When it freezes, you have to take the entire battery out. When the phone boots back up it takes forever.2. Sometimes it's not that responsive. I've had calls come in but it wouldn't let me answer them. (this has only happened twice)3. For some reason, new programs keep getting added to my button list. I don't like that. Right now, this bing application and Vcast videos have added themselves to my button list. I know you can hide them, but I shouldn't have to hide them4. The manual is crappy!5. I haven't been able to figure out how to add ringtones to my phone. There seems to be some key fetaures missing from my menus. The manual says that I should be able to see this and that but they aren't there. It should be easier to do this.6. I don't like that the number pad disappears when you are in a call. You can bring it back up, but I just wish it didn't disappear.7. I wish there were more useful applications on it.This phone could have been better.

When I first saw the reviews of the BB storm I was very disappointed. But even with such low rating I was convinced with some of the higher rated reviews and decided to go ahead and buy this phone. When I finally got it let me tell you, I was disappointed with its performance and how difficult it was to text (so in my head I was feeling as I should have followed my habit of always buying a product taking account of it's reviews). So I decided to investigate a little more about this problem and found out that you could fix almost every problem with the phone by just upgrading the OS. Let me tell you the difference is amazing. Its now really easy to text, apps work smoothly, and let me tell you.... it has become an iphone killer. The quality of audio and video (resolution) is so much better. The 3g Internet is much faster than the iphone.. So in conclusion if there are any bad reviews about this phone it was because the engineers over at rim, had not yet deciphered the right software for this phone, now that you can download the latest OS I think it'll start to get much higher opinions.

And after they'll pray (like now)for an IPHONE (the Storm's father). You people should think about buying good phones, like Nokia's or HTC's, but CRAPBERRIES? IPHONE? even MOTOROLA is the same thing than RIM products, come on think about it. Have you seen the NOKIA N900? the HTC DIAMOND 2? NOKIA has an application called OVI, it is like blackberry messenger but better... IT'S FREE... do you think blackberry service is for free? you should check your accounts, at least in my country, blackberry service, as itself, is not free.Oh, I almost forgot, I don't have a Crapberry and I wish I never will jajajajajaja but I have to admit that I've been having a lot of fun reading your reviews. Actually I have an HTC Touch vogue 6900, and I CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, I found the software upgrades, games, applications, FOR FREE... It works like a baby, as a matter of fact IT IS MY BABY.

Do you really want to pay for IPHONE'S applications? jajajajajajajajajajaja HTC's applications!!!! you can find it for free, as NOKIA'S too... upgrades? FREE too... Nokia is like Toyota, have you ever seen a Toyota with the hood lifted up in the freeway? I haven't, as I have never seen a NOKIA driving someone crazy.For the HTC, well that's another history, I had a HTC 6800 before my glorious HTC 6900, and was a pain in the a.... but I just changed it and everything has been good since then.Well DON'T BUY CRAPBERRIES JUST FOR FASHION, CRAPBERRY idiot people have msn messenger too,  so don't cry, you can chat with them anyway... bye", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 3G Network HSDPA 2100\nTFT capacitive touchscreen, 65K colors Size 360 x 480 pixels, 3.25 inches.
