People have told me they can tell it's not American and get excited when I show them the dual camera feature.  I'm glad I bought it with warranty and unlocked (glad I read about it) or else I'd have serious problems.  I am using T-Mobile service with this phone and since it's only a prepaid account and with minimal services, I don't get to use every feature (such as video call) that I could get if I had a contract.  I have trouble sending picture messages, but I have yet to find out if it's because of my service or if I had to change the settings in order to get them. Nevertheless, it's a great phone. It's colorful, simple, and nice to have.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like T-Mobile.
