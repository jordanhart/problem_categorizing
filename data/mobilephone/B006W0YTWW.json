{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony Xperia S - Outstanding phone", "Author": "NB", "ReviewID": "R2NZKXFAIJY92K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To me this phone is outstanding. All the functions expected from an excellent phone are there. Very nice reception, WiFi connectivity, sound, Camera, good battery life, NFC option and superb display (best in its class). If I try to search a negative point then the only thing comes in my mind is TFT display with normal screen. Sony should improvise in this area and should introduce Corning Gorilla glass (yes, I have another phone with that and it really makes difference).Apart from this I did not find anything specific as of now.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006W0YTWW"}}
