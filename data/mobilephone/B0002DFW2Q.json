It is easy to move from menu to menu by pressing the shown number (or scroll around and press select if you want).-Some useful functions are hidden away under three menu levels (ie Calculator, Alarm, Calendar). There is no way to assign a shortcut. There are built-in shortcuts to internet, text messaging, contacts, instant messaging.-It is easy to put the phone to vibrate, even without opening it.-The light on the outside lights red if there is a waiting message (voice or text) but not when you have missed calls.-You cannot use most of the phone's functions when talking on the phone. (ie you cannot play games if you have a headset and are having a boring conversation.) But you can take a 'note' and later save it as a phone number.-The phone can only \"ring and vibrate\" at the highest volume.-The volume control for the games is tied to the volume of the ringer. So if you lower the volume while playing and forget to increase it afterward, the ringer will be quiet. Also, if the phone is set to loudest ring, some menu confirmation will elicit a loud sound from the phone (ie entering a new contact.)

Having driven there through traffic and rain, I was surprised to find my options for a replacement limited, especially since my now dead Nokia had lasted just slightly longer than its warranty.I left with a nifty little (slightly) used LG 1300 as the replacement and decided to let a month go by and see what I thought. At this point, the pros outweigh the cons, but, one person's pro might be another's con and vice versa. Human nature being what it is, I think it is more fun to focus on the cons first.First the battery life is short, and the claim that this phone has up to 240 minutes of standby is debatable. There should be some sort of way to shake this thing around and generate a bit more time. Better yet, if one could hop violently from side to side as though afflicted with St. Vitus' Dance (which is a self-limiting disorder of movement caused by both streptococcal infection and by talking loudly on cell phones in crowded venues) and recharge the battery, then that would be very entertaining to watch.Next, this phone is so small that it could be confused with a big pack of chewing gum. This feature is bad only if you keep a cluttered desk or satchel and keep having to call your cell phone from your desk phone in order to locate the little gizmo. The washing machine poses another, perhaps lethal set of consequences that could stem from the size of this phone.We need to talk about the buzzer/vibrate setting, a feat of malicious engineering that deserves Cingular----I meant singular----mention. A pair of nondescript, tiny buttons grace the left side of the LG 1300. These buttons magically change the phone's setting from vibrate, silent, or ring if you accidentally press them. So when the phone rings, it's best to poke it with a stick first, then flip it open from the junction of the bottom/top not the sides.(Permit me a parenthetical word about the buzzing or vibrating here. If you have a small chassis from a toy car available, you set the LG 1300 to vibrate, attach it to the chassis with a rubber band, put it on tray or cutting board and presto, you have a dynamic cat toy! Just call your number from another phone and your felines will pounce all over this sleek, mouse-like marvel.)I was surprised at the poor selection of ring tones---or is it spelled solid as ringtones?---available, but then I found that the initial menu pick on the phone takes one to a media mall. I haven't visited there yet, but if I'm ever hungry I may try out the food court.There are good things about this phone. The buttons sort of click when you press them, which makes it seem like you are entering data into one of those tricoders from the any of the various Star Trek series. Using the menus is pretty intuitive (unlike say those in a French restaurant), and changing the settings requires minimal effort.Once flipped open, the earpiece and mouthpiece are sort of in the vicinity of the human ear and mouth, respectively, which does make a degree of sense in the design of a telephone! Plus this phone does not have a camera!! It's bad enough to have to talk to some of my friends, but if I also had to look at them, I would never use the phone.I've also had some trouble with calls being dropped, and if this is happening because of some undocumented feature in the user manual, then I would like to know what it is. To me, this is not necessarily a bad thing because there is simply no better way to get out of an uncomfortable or unwanted conversation than to hang up on yourself.The sleek, curved, compact case makes one feel a bit like a spy, so the coolness factor should not be discounted entirely. And the designers even included this wild little mirror on the outside. Although this tiny mirror gets smudged quite a bit, who knows, it could someday save your life if you are ever stranded and need to attract the attention of any would-be rescuers once your phone's battery has died.Postscript: On November 15, 2006, I made the offhand remark that I was going to replace this phone soon.

Since this is my first one, I was shocked when I got it for Christmas!!! I couldn't believe it!!! This phone is amazing by having an incredable LCD display that is bright and clear! It has very good sound quality when talking/listening to people and when listening to ringtones. There are a few \"cool\" ringtones such as: Twilight and Rock Me, but that's about it. I would recommend buying your own. The one of the down sides for me is the battery life. The talk time is only four hours and stand-by time isn't that long either. Since I don't talk on the weekdays anyway, I usually leave my phone off. But during the weekends, I talk on it forever causing the battery to run low. Another down side is the external mirror. I wish it could have been an external caller ID or something nice. The only useful thing is the LED light implanted in the mirror telling if your phone battery is charged or not. Overall, for my first cell phone, this is great!! Has everything I wanted in a cell phone! The only two concerns are battery life and the external mirror.

I think that you shouldn't even take it for free, for two reasons: 1. you'll be paying a bundle a month for a service you can barely use, and 2. you probably passed up another free phone that no matter how bad it is, has to be better than the LG 1300.My major complaint is dropped calls. (The battery life is a little thin, but I would say not a major problem.) But it's really tough to have a conversation more involved than \"when are you getting home?\" \"seven.\" \"okay, see you then.\" because you will spend half your time saying, \"wait, can you say that again?\" The reception is awful (/with/ the new antenna) even when the phone doesn't drop calls. Plus, the sound quality is really poor, and as other people have said you have to grind the phone into your ear to make out anything the other person is saying.DO NOT take this as a free phone as I did - ANYTHING would be better.

Now sometimes when I go to use the phone I will try to dial out and it will say EMERGANCY ONLY and all bars are full for reception. Another thing it does is go off on it's own. It also takes a long time to read the sim card when turned on about a minute. Another issue is the ring tones are verylow on sound so I hardly ever hear it ring unless on vibrate and it's in my pocket. Sometimes to phone will alert me of a voice mail message but no list of missed call. Or it will ring a half hour later informing me of a message received when I have another call. I hate this phone so much. Sometimes when it does not allow me to call out I will open up the battery back and reinsert the sim card then it all of a sudden works or I will hit it against my hand and it will work.

Because I'm on the road a lot, being able to put a smaller phone into my pocket, briefcase, of handbag without dealing with locking and unlocking the keypad each time I used it is a real convience.  I also wanted to get a stroner signal than I was able to get with he Nokia.  I use a company provided Moterola Flip Phone that is newer than my Nokia and get a really great signal with it. I paid $50 for the LG C1300 phone.  I was assured by the salesperson that the LG brand, although new, was in their experience performing well.  This phone has only a fraction of the features my 2 year older model Nokia had, the signal is worse than any I've ever had and the phone is not very user friendly.
