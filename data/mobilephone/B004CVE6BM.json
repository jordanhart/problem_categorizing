{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great LG Phone", "Author": "MStyle", "ReviewID": "R162GCC0E27ARD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone after another seller cancelled my previous order for another phone. It came much faster than I expected and the phone itself worked right out of the box.One thing to be aware of though: All of the menus (including the start up screen) are made for AT&T.; But seeing that they are my carrier, this is not a problem for me. However other people using T-Mobile may not be able to use these features (ex. AT&T; music, MobiTV, AT&T; Mall).This is a great phone and I would highly recommend buying it. I have had it for almost a week now and have had no problems with it. It's design is also stunning and puts many touch screen phones of today to shame.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "great for the price", "Author": "angelkitty", "ReviewID": "R2LEDS43PPOFF0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it arrived in the allotted time and works great just wish the keyboard was a bit bigger due to my large fingers not that friendly for texting other than that works great and a even bargain for the price thank you for reading this", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT PHONE", "Author": "Justin", "ReviewID": "RI6T8ZZYIFGU3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a GREAT phone!!!! i had this exact phone but lost it so i tried a couple others but DID NOT like them.

I am annoyed at having to charge the phone daily.  I don't think the talk time is hour(S), maybe an hour.  To many dropped calls if you hold the back of the phone.  i am having to use as a speaker phone, waiting on earpiece to arrive to see how that will help.  Very disappointed.As far as the seller, phone was in terrific condition, delivery was a promised.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent for a first phone", "Author": "Katy", "ReviewID": "R3L7AMB15MN089", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this when it first came out as my first cell phone. For what I needed (texting and the occasional call) It was pretty decent. The only major thing I didn't like was the battery life. I had to charge it every single night, and could only talk on the phone for about an hour a day (total) or else it would die. Occasionally, it would lag and freeze for about 2 minutes, but catch up with me and do whatever I had attempted to do when it had frozen. The amount of texts it could hold was disappointing, and for someone who is always texting, it got a bit frustrating (that is why I gave it 3 instead of 4 stars). But over all, its a decent and pretty strong phone.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Doesn't even work", "Author": "Anon", "ReviewID": "R1Y29BAF6DCG62", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have never written a review for anything I have bought on amazon until now. The phone came one day earlier than expected but it doesn't work. It won't turn on and I have had it charged for 24 hrs. If you take the battery out and plug it in it flashes the AT&T; screen every 5 seconds. Other than that it doesn't work period. Im waiting to return it and see if they fix this \"problem\" I will update with another review when I get the OTHER phone.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004CVE6BM"}}
