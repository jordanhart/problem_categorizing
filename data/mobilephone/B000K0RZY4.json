I didnt know that I'd be getting the exact same phone! It arrived very quickly, within 4 days. The only issue i had was UPS was late delivering the package, but whatever thats okay. I opened it up and turned it on to find it to be exactly the way they described. It doesnt have much in the way of fancy things, but it definitely works for texting and calls. The most notable feature so far is email integration. You receive emails like text messages.The only con is the battery life, its about 12 hours of standby, but if you dont work in the field you'll be just fine.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "complete crap dont buy", "Author": "M.
