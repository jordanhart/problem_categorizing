There's not a whole lot else to say about it, really. Its biggest drawback is its lack of internal storage, but a sixteen or thirty-two gig microSD card will sort that out. The screen response is a bit less snappy than the top of the line Galaxy models, but this is a budget phone after all.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "I've never had a smartphone plan before. I like this phone for what I need.", "Author": "Sean Alexander", "ReviewID": "R1Z3932V9QT3Q1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this on sale with a new plan for $45. Saving the extra money, I prepaid 2 months of bills.You know, I feel like with smart phones either you'll get a really good deal on a really good phone that someone upgraded from. Let's say your buddy upgraded to the S4 on his tmobile plan, so he's getting rid of his old s3. Maybe you trade away your xbox360 so he can give it to his kid for a birthday gift. Or... you're buying your own phone. If you're buying your own, just get a small one until you come by a good deal. Don't spend $300+ on a no-contract phone.The interface on this feels snappier than an iphone 3GS.. maybe even a little springier than the iphone4. The smaller screen resolution isn't bothersome. It's a good phone that fits in your pocket easily. The camera compared to an iphone4: awesome. It comes with VPN support.[[[[Now here's the sticky.]]] The important considerations. If you want lots of apps and games installed. DONT GET THIS PHONE. \"Move apps to SD\" is not supported even with a root. Maybe with a custom ROM, but I haven't gotten there yet. Samsung is a little weird with this. It might be fine for a 16GB s3/s4 to keep the apps on the main memory, but this suckers got 1 Gig.If, however, you need basic phone stuff, your few web apps for banking, amazon price check, netflix, tapatalk, social networking, etc... and plan to use up the rest of the space for music, movies, and pictures. THIS IS A GOOD AFFORDABLE PHONE. I have a class 10/UHS-I 32GB SD card in here that I got for $30 (Total phone price now $75) and it is amazing. I had an old fuji finepix camera that stored 480p video in MJPEG and would eat 4GB in 3 mins of video. This baby stores 720p \"superfine\" video in H.264 at around 12Mbps. That leaves you with 6 hours or so of video available on your SD card. Go to Walmart and find a point and shoot that does that for this price. Additional plus, Spotify seems to cache offline content on your SD card automatically. So, your offline playlists are safe to take up space. Just remember, if you're considering a $300 phone and a <$100 phone on no-contract... the $200 you save can get you almost 2 YEARS of a better data option.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Jen", "ReviewID": "R1ZPB516GV8HK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I've ordered many things online and many things from Amazon, this is the 1st time I actually purchased a phone.

It is a very basic smartphone for phone calls and texting that runs on the MetroPcs/T-Mobile's nationwide network.  IT IS LOCKED TO METROPCS until you complete 90 days of paid service.The Exhibit sells for $49 on the MetroPcs website with free two day shipping and a full 12 month Samsung warranty.  Some Amazons vendors are selling USED Exhibits for more than $49 which do NOT have a Samsung warranty.WARNING:  If a third party vendor on Amazon.com (such as \"PhonesAreUs\") claims to be selling an UNLOCKED Exhibit, they may be selling a used phone or a stolen phone that can NOT be activated in the USA and which has the wrong 3G channels to work outside of the USA.  Buy ONLY from the MetroPcs webstore or from the \"Official\" Amazon.com phone store to get a NEW Exhibit that comes with the 12 month Samsung warranty.Weak Points: A tiny internal memory that limits you to installing just a few small apps. A weak battery. A poor camera. A small screen.Strong Point:  The Exhibit does a good job with phones calls and texting. If that is all you need a phone for, the Exhibit will do a good job.Keep at least 200 mb of open internal memory or the Exhibit will freeze up and stop working.You will need to add an SD memory card to have room for your photos, videos and music.

The phone was released last year as a mid-tier phone. Such as technology moves, now its considered on the higher end of lowered tier phones. I have had entry level phones before but this one has a cheaper built to it. Coming from a HTC V one that has a sturdier built and a metal back to it. So far it handles everything fairly well and is a quicker than my HTC One which only had a single core processor of the same speed. It should handle most apps except for possibly some of the newer 3d games fairly well. The charger included seems cheap. The wire is so thin compared to my previous chargers. In fact Iam using my HTC charger. Though probably for the price some corners where cut. It also doesnt include the headphone set. This been the give away phone (sorta speak) expect too see everyone and their mothers with it unfortunately. As well this phone is one several carriers you gonna to be seen this phone everywhere. I would buy a case for this ASAP. For two reasons first of all the phone seems flimsy doesnt have that sturdy feel. Second as i mentioned youll gonna be seen a bunch of people with this same phone. I will upate if any changes.**small update..i wouldnt say the battery is bad, but it could be a little better. After a days use ive been at around 30% left in charge.
