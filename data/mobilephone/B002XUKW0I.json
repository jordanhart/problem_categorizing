We love the sliding feature with the hidden keyboard. It takes good pictures and has a nice large screen so everything is easy to see. The sound is good. It took a little while to get used to navigating around the menus and so forth, but it's not too difficult. The battery stays charged for really long periods and that's a HUGE plus. We would recommend this phone to other people in a heartbeat (and have, in fact)!", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty package, poor design", "Author": "J. Scarborough", "ReviewID": "R17IS6YF27D8MG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had my Nokia 2720 about 2 weeks before returning it and have little good to say about it other than it seemed well made, had a solid feel and a reasonable battery life.For three reasons I decided to return it.1. The phone was black and shiny, sleek and attractive as long as no one had touched it since it was cleaned. Pick it up and use it a couple of times and it looked like a scuzzy mess. I would have been embarrassed to let anyone else see it closely, much less use it.2. The phone had a one button combination navigation and select(OK) key which was actually recessed slightly, making it difficult to use. It was all too easy to hit OK when trying to scroll, which I found somewhat annoying. It might have been usable, however, by someone with long fingernails or tiny little fingers. As a male with short fingernails, I could scroll down one-handed with no problem, using my thumb on the key. To scroll up or to either side reliably I had to hold the phone in one hand and use the back (nail) of a finger or thumb on the other hand to press the key. Otherwise I kept hitting OK. If you have a low frustration point or would like to be able to use your phone one-handed, you should consider another phone.3. I could have lived with the two deficiencies above. The straw that broke the camel's back was the ear speaker. Even in a reasonably quiet room at max volume it was difficult to hear well unless the speaker opening was positioned in precisely the right spot on my ear. Unfortunately, when I placed the phone to my ear in a natural, comfortable location, as I would do when answering a call, the opening was about an inch above the \"right\" spot and I couldn't hear squat. The \"right\" spot also irritated my ear after a few minutes. If you are going to be using your phone in a noisy environment (and who doesn't), you should consider another phone.In closing, I can't recommend this phone except perhaps as a wall hanging. It's mighty pretty when all polished up.", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Reliable, Good features at a Great Price", "Author": "M C", "ReviewID": "RLNPAQDMMR0F4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this phone for $20 including a $28.00 TMobile prepaid airtime credit for a family member.

Once you reach Gold status (spend $100 prepaid) you get a 15% bonus and your service remains active for a whole year (you do need available minutes).From an external review site: The 2720 has an upgraded camera.

But the person you are talking to with the phone (like when my Mom calls me) is TERRIBLE. There is a TON of background 'noise', usually sounding like she is holding the phone out her window as she's driving!

(1) The volume of the phone was so low that I could hardly hear the conversation even it is set at the highest volume. (2) The menu key includes a big square area above number panel. A very slim rim around the center square is where we push up, down, left and right for getting to the icons for set up. It takes someone with concentration adn long finger nails to be able to maneuver correctly. (3) Today, we went back to the same T-Mobile store. We went over 2 more Nokia 2720 phones with exactly the same issue. The sales representative told us that we could not try it any more. We could either take one of the Nokia 2720 phone as we had paid, or take a different model of phone but pay $10 re-stocking fee.I don't know how they could continue selling products like this poor qualiy, and not letting customers to exchange with restocking fee. I'm sure they must have lots of unhappy customer like I am.

It was a good phone for the first day that I used it. But when I tried to set the passcode for my phone, it went all techy on me and locked my SIM card and it locked me out of my phone. I called ATT Customer Service for help, and told me, \"We can not help you over the phone if you have a LG phone,\" the only way they could help me was if I had another phone with a SIM card slot. Well I didn't, so then they told me, \"Take it to an ATT Corps. Store, you CANNOT take it to a retailer,\" well I was pretty ticked off because I didn't have an ATT Corps. Store in my area! I was finally satisfied when we finally returned it for a new one that same day!The hardware design is really good, and I liked the feel to the phone. The TOUCH DIAL feature was really good, but I wished it had a full touchscreen.I bought my Go Phone from Walmart and it came with $50 airtime included in the package. I liked that it came with that, but was not impressed when I could only choose a plan that didn't take money off my account each day. It was the 25 cents plan where every minute is 25 cents (even if its not a minute)! All I wanted to do was text basically on it, but my hopes and dreams were crushed when I found out with the \"plan\" I got, it would cost 20 cents for each text message I send AND receive! That was a real pain until I got 1000 messages for $10 that came off my airtime (you only get 30 days to use ALL of the messages or they are gone!).Another thing that I didn't really like about it was they charge you for SETTING UP YOUR OWN VOICEMAIL! So if you don't know how to set up a voicemail, then leave it! I spent $1.25 of my money just setting it up! I was really upset with ATT for doing that! You would think it was for free! WRONG! Then to for me to set up my account, they sent me a \"Free Text message\" from them!Overall I like the phone, hate the service! I use it basically to text now that I got 1000 messages. But that won't last long before I have to spend 10 bucks again just for a decent deal! DO NOT MESS WITH THE SECURITY SETTINGS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!I would recommend the phone to people who are just starting with cell phones, or just get a regular ATT plan! I am happy with the phone now because I got it all under control, but if you are not familiar with these kind of phones, DO NOT GET THEM! Read the plan features first before you buy them!If you do get a GO phone, then good for you! But my suggestion for those who want to text a lot, get the unlimited texting for 20 bucks a month (this also comes out of your airtime!).", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lg prepaid AT&T;", "Author": "Mantlady- Woman of the West", "ReviewID": "R3AFZDXW5XC9N1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works well for my needs, which are minimal.
