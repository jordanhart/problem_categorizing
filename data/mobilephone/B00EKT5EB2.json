{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent phone, probably too complex for \"non-smartphone\" users", "Author": "Kevin P Lord", "ReviewID": "R3U2EV074JI2X6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Decent phone, gets the job done.  The touch screen seems to be a little problematic at times.  I bought this phone for parents who aren't technologically 'savvy' and they say the keys on the keyboard are too small and sometimes have a rough time answering the phone due to the touch screen not reacting correctly.  Seems basic items such as listening to your voicemail are a little cumbersome and complex for people who would buy this phone.  I'd imagine the general consumer of this phone are less advanced users who need the ability to text, but don't need the smart phone capabilities.  I don't think this phone is as easy as it should be to operate.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EKT5EB2"}}
