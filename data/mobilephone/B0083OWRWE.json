It said a week and it only to two days. I like the phone, haven't had any issues with it since I started using it. The only thing I was a little disappointed in was the picture showed ear pieces, original box and a hard case for the phone but when it came all I got was the phone and a charger. But I really cant complain. I got a great phone and it is so much better then what I had. Plus you cant beat the price.  Lovin my new phone and my daughter wants one too.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is a ok phone.", "Author": "dickgt", "ReviewID": "R2QS6204UAQWP8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not much to say, its a GS1.
