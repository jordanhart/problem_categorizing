{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far so good.....", "Author": "Mister  Happy", "ReviewID": "R2Z4UL2RMKQLYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to use in Costa Rica, as it operates on the UMTS 850 band.  Maybe I'm not quite as picky as some other reviewers.  I didn't buy this thinking I was getting cutting edge technology - I just wanted a smartphone that would work in Central America plus give me the ability to check my email and facebook without spending a fortune.  I installed Skype - not for video calls but for skype to skype voice calls.  I also installed Rebtel for the same purpose.The MicroSD card is tough to get in the slot.  You really have to push that thing to get it in there.  The sim cards go in easily.The phone has a nice design.  It is easy to operate as the touch screen and buttons are very responsive, and the OS boots much quicker than my HTC Nexus One. Wifi connects quickly, browser loads pages quick.  It's a nice phone overall.For a new unlocked 3g dual sim Android phone that works in Central America, I think this phone is a heck of a deal for $109.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "COOL BLU", "Author": "RyanC", "ReviewID": "R20S5JVCLH66OL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a replacement phone for my Blackberry Curve when I came across the BLU Rave D230 which I affectionately call the \"Cool Blu\" . it's inexpensive and packed with cool features. This is my first Android phone and I must say i'm thoroughly impressed. The Android 2.2 OS is clever and responsive and it works great with my 3G Sim card. It also has all the great features of a much more expensive phone. It's sleek and light weight but durable, just a great all around phone. The shipping was fast and it arrived as promised. The very first thing I did was insert my 16GB SD card from my old blackberry into the Blu Rave and the transition was flawless! With room for up to 32GB of expandable memory this phone can hold all my pics and songs with no problem. Battery life is good so is sound quality, it also supports my emails which was a huge plus for me coming from the Blackberry world. Again it's just a great all around phone, I give it a well deserved 5 stars.RyanC", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Derf", "Author": "furg", "ReviewID": "R2180G1WE5SU54", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Buught this phone for work over seas. I havent gotten to use it with a local carer yet but I have my personal sim and my work sim instaled an both work well... AT&T; cards. The OS is frendly and sim slection minue is slected for each call. this phone feals good in my hand and single stroke single hand usage is eazy as it is not sa big as my Samsung G @ 4.0\" I\"m Acustom to the Windows 7 OS and I\"m happy to say Android OS is a self teacher. The phone dos nnt feal cheeep. the one thing that is a bother is shot bat life, light dayly use means a full charge that night. Also i have notesed that when my hand gets a litle damp tuch screan function is nill. Fourtunatly this phone has phisical ancer and end and home keys to let you control it with out touching the screan. I\"m not that big on the tech. side and havent got the e-mail working yet but its nice to know its there as well as the blue touth.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't judge a book by its cover", "Author": "Irishgirl358", "ReviewID": "R27XAXPPCDOL9P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've been the owner of many smart phones.  I just love technology. This arrived quickly, as most things do with Amazon.The phone was slim, sleek, stylish and very light weight.  All in all the look and feel of a great high class smart phone.The battery died quickly. I mean if you don't constantly plug this baby in, it will be dead before you know it and probably right when you need it most.  The GPS never worked.  I could rarely get connected correctly to the network,very frustrating.  Apps that worked on my previous phone, which I would have deemed inferior to this one...did not work correctly!  The phone kept uninstalling things randomly and then reinstalling them again.  On the very first day it started this shut down/start up cycle.  I assumed it may have just been due to the need for the phone to update things from the carrier system.  Well, I will tell you this \"cycle\" continued EVERY day and then began occurring multiple times a day up to the point where the only way to stop it from cycling around and around was to pull out the battery.  Absolutely awful.  I can not have a phone that may leave me stranded in a dangerous situation. Maybe I got a glitchy phone, but from my experience, I'd recommend NOT wasting your money.  It saddens me to have to even write this because everything I usually find on Amazon has been awesome.Also I do recommend searching around for additional reviews on this phone from other people in case you really have your heart set on purchasing it. Beware.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "awesome phone!", "Author": "dk", "ReviewID": "R34KCKY9O32LH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just ordered this phone on July 10th and received quickly by July 13th. So delivery was pretty fast, and this was with the regular delivery, not express.Everything you need is in the box which includes usb cable, charger, battery, and headset. I had no trouble inserting my sim card and my own sd card. I was quickly up and running with my T-Mobile Sim.My data with T-mobile plan works great! I also have WiFi in my home, and that works great also with this phone. Texting is fun, however, I will say that it takes practice to use the virtual keyboard after I was use to a regular keyboard with my Blackberry phone.I love the 3.2 inch screen. It is beautiful and clear. Talking on the phone is also very clear. The stereo headset is used as an antenna for the fm radio the phone has. This is a great feature to listen to music.The best part of this phone has got to be the gps and maps. It is found under the menu by the name of Longitude. I have never had a phone with the gps and it works great. When you are inside, you will need to activate the phone for wifi instead of gps satellite since the gps needs a clear view of the sky to work. However, in a wifi area there is no problem with activating the maps and getting directions. Works like a dream! It even has a program for voice turn by turn directions that you can download to the phone for free in just a few seconds.The only problem I see so far is that the battery life is shorter than I am used to. If you use the gps or data, the battery power is sucked up fast. I find myself needing to charge the phone each day a couple of times. To save on the battery, I disable my data and wifi on the phone when not needed. Phone stays pretty well charged for regular texting or talking longer that way.Also, I have not found any accessories to go with this phone. On the Blu website they do not have anything for this phone, in fact, they do not even show it. However, any accessories I may need I can find in other markets. For example, I need a car charger if I am going to be using the gps for an extended time, so I can purchase a universal charger with mini usb which will work fine.All in all I am very happy with this phone. I only paid $99 for it, and it looks much more expensive. The touch screen is beautiful and works well. It has the pinch and stretch ability to enlarge or decrease size as needed. This comes in handy for small print.This phone looks and feels much better than my Blackberry Curve I have used for two years. The Blackberry has a very small screen in comparison, and did not offer GPS or touch screen. This is an Android Phone open to the Android marketplace for lots of applications. I really have everything I need on the phone right now, without doing lots of downloads, however,it is nice to know if I need them, they are there.I highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006YUY0QA"}}
