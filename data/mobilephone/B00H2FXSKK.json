{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A wise purchase", "Author": "Joe Smith", "ReviewID": "RPDZBQ3OB73PE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have been using this phone about 1 month now, I have found it to be smooth running and runs perfectly.Pros:1) Standard Sized SIM card slot - This device is unlocked and will work for 3G and 2G on AT&T;, T-Mobile and other GSMs. This works perfectly on my AT&T; and I get 3G. Actually for the $150 dollars paid for this model, it is well worth it, I just carry ONE device now.2) HSPA 3G Setting- I did not have to enter the APN settings, it did this automatically when I started the setup, opened the data and I logged on to my Gmail, etc and then turned off data and then on to WiFi settings, etc.3) External Micro SD Card Slot - This is one of the many reasons I purchased this phone and I have a 32GB SD card installed with plenty of room left!4) WiFi setup (EASY) - Here is how I set it up: I went into Settings, WiFi and turned the WiFi on. When it turned on, it showed my home WiFi router modem. I then selected this to connect and it asked me for the passcode (the router had it on it). Then I typed in the pass-code and my WiFi started right up with a excellent connection! Very strong WiFi signal at home and every hotspot I have tried!5) Phone Call Quality / Sound Quality (Both with speaker and headset)- the phone call clarity is clean and plenty loud whether on the speaker or the headset (I tried on both Bluetooth headset and wired headset). NO dropped calls ever! Sound quality for music is good as well on the speakers and on the headset.6) Adobe Flash installed - I can watch all kinds of Internet videos!7) 1 year US Warranty - the warranty information came with the package and full manual can be downloaded from its website.CONS:1) 3G Speed - the average 3G speed is 20% faster than my Internet speed with AT&T;, I get 5.6 Mb/Sec Download, and 1.2 Mb/Sec Upload.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good value for money", "Author": "Denial Stwen", "ReviewID": "R940UF72G1T22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace a galaxy S3 that I gave to my wife. I did not want to spend too much but wanted a good experience and so far it has been great. The device is beautiful to look at and hold, and the screen is very sharp. The size is similar compare to the galaxy S3, and it's bigger than an iPhone 5. Really happy with my purchase and best price for very nice specs comparing with other phones in same class. The shipping was very quick. The only thing about phone is I hope the camera could have been a little better.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Phone - Can't Wait for the Case", "Author": "Rachel Palma", "ReviewID": "R1CGXL2TIYFEME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like the title says really nice phone purchase mine, it is so good, I just had to say something about it.Really nice screen, watching videos either movies or HD YouTube video are stunning on the 4.7 inch screen. With that said the device isn\u2019t too big and I have pretty medium size hands and it fits nicely in my hand, and no difficulty operating the phone with just one hand.The operating system does get some getting use to, however it is simple and straight forward to operate. Has tons of features and I am still learning the features the phone come packaged with. Running apps on it is fast and simple though I have run into some apps that are not fully compatible that lead to speed slower not a biggie but a little annoying.Battery life is so-so to say and it really depends on your particular usage: power user vs normal user. The battery under high usage battery goes really quick fastest was 4-5 hours from 100%, normal usage 7-8 hours and when mostly standby 3-4 days (so far tested, might be more than that).Camera phone is fast almost zero shutter lag, but with that comes blurry image made worse if in low lit setting, under normal phone taking session letting the camera auto focus and snapping picture the photos taken are amazing, outdoor with optimum sunlight practically no issue.Final thoughts a really well rounded phone with its most ups! Still looking for a nice case, but seems no clues yet.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "J. Wooster", "ReviewID": "R260CN6XXWMAWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had no idea that RCA made a cell phone, but am very happy to have found this one.  It is similar to the Samsung Galaxy S3 in size.  After reading a couple of reviews, I tried several cases that fit the Samsung G3, but this phone is slightly thicker, by maybe 1 or 2 mm, so I couldn't get the hard cases to snap shut, but I did end up getting a gel case and it seems to stay on so far, although the holes in the one I got from ebay aren't exact, it will work for protection. I would buy several cases if RCA would come out with some, will keep checking!  As for the phone's functionality, I love it!  It has Jellybean and runs really fast.  I use Straight Talk as my provider and it was super easy to set up.  Just slid in my SIM card and my SD card and Viola!  Didn't have to add APN or anything, the phone did all the work.  The only CON I can comment on is the 3.5 mm plug, could be just the phone I received though.  I have tried 4 new sets of earbuds besides the ones that came with the phone (since that one had the hard earbuds and I prefer the soft), but none of them will work, there is a clicking sound and I can't heard the caller.  They also will not work with the MP3 player.  Really wish I could use the earbuds... Don't know if it is normal or not and it isn't really a CON, but the back does get a little hot when I've been on the phone a while.

It resembles a Samsung S 3, its not a real high end phone so dont expect perfection friends. Quite simply put, its money well spent. I bought 2 sim cards here on Amazon for the phone being its a dual sim card phone, the sim cards were for Straight Talk phones. I also added a 32 gig Ultra micro SD card.I then called Straight Talk customer service and they helped me free of charge activate the RCA phone. The phone works flawlessly, and is pretty fast. The screen and the flimsy power button could be improved upon, other than those 2 complaints im very happy with my purchase. What do ya want for $150.00 ?

Pros The phone is very responsive Great screen Comes with screen protector already on it External SD up to 32 gb Great battery life (I keep wifi off unless needed) GPS Voice navigation Beautiful looking phone Sound quality of calls and speaker phone great Good camera and has flash and auto focus video good dual sim cards 1 year warranty unlocked You can use the phone as a remote for tv It automatically comes with apps that people will actually use:  Sound Recorder (love this app as I can remind myself of what I need to pick up or do while I am running errands)  Maps  Navigation - You can type the address or speak the address for directions  Calculator  Calendar  Flash Player - Can watch anything  Music app  to store your music  YouTube  Video recording and  video playback (in Camera app)  Camera with flash  Voice search - recognizes your voice  Flash Light  FM radio  Places - lets you know what restaurants, attractions are in the area  Play Store  Gallery - which all pictures and videos get stored inCons  -  NoneAll I had to do was put a 32 SD card in, download Amazon mp3 app, download my music from Cloud Player, which automatically was stored in Music app, downloaded Facebook app, Skype, Voice to Text and I was good to goThe ear buds that came with the phone are clear, (no static),  however, I choose to purchase Sony  MERDX 40LP/WHI ear buds because I like more bass and the sound quality is excellent.FM radio stations sometimes have static, however, I believe that has to do with the signals, not the phone itself.If you are experiencing  dropped calls, unclear calls, static or your WIFI is having problems connecting, please keep in mind that it may not be the phone but actually the provider you choose.  I purchased an A T & T $25 plan with 250 minutes, unlimited text and no data.  I can also add extra minutes to the phone during the month if needed. I have no dropped calls, no static and people say they can hear me very clearly. I have had absolutely no problems connecting to WIFI as well.The seller sells hard covers for the phone in blue and white. The hard cover does not fit over the RCA phone.  You must take off the RCA cover and replace it with the generic hard cover. A Samsung Galaxy 3 gel cover will also fit.  No one sells a car charger, however, Motorola car charger will work with this phone, or you can purchase a USB charger and connect the cable that came with the phone to use as a car charger.This phone is easily mistaken for the Samsung Galaxy 3.  The phones are almost identical. I can't say enough about this phone.  This is the world's best kept secret....a smartphone that works just as well as other expensive androids at a fraction of the cost, and finally, a sealed, unlocked phone that is actually made in the USA.rcamobile customer service is very good.

At first I thought it was that I was just missing them, but now, it doesn't ring at all. For awhile when a call came in, I got a text message sound, and then the call went to voice mail. But now nothing at all. So that is the biggest CON. Another problem was that the button on the bottom to bring up the screen stopped working. Other problems with the phone are that the picture quality is very bad. Despite having a flash, I can't use it to deposit checks because the pictures of the checks are too dark to read. And the volume control is at the side of the phone, and it is easy to depress this without knowing it lowering the ring voume. (Yes, I checked that, and the failure to ring is not that the volume is lowered by mistake).As for Pro's... It has great features to let you manage the amount of data that you want to use. Also it is very good at finding WIFI just about anywhere and almost always being connected via wifi. My data charges just about went away when I started using this phone.The size is the same as a samsung, so the fact that there is not an RCA case, is not such a problem because a samsung case fits with just a minor adjustment (had to widen the opening to plug in the charger). Another good thing is that motorola chargers fit this phone.The phone claims to have a warranty, but it requires sending in the phone for them to \"fix\".
