For instance, some merchants might sell you a phone, without a charger.  Then, when you return the phone because it doesn't work, they refund some, but not all of your money and then say that you never returned the charger.  Except for the fact that the phone's ring/vibrate function did not work, I liked the phone.  It also would have been nice if the phone had come with a wall charger, especially since I was charged for one.  Ultimately, I ended up doing business with Brownboxbonanza, who was not only HONEST, but pleasant to deal with as well.

I contacted the Seller & he refunded part of my money since it was a USED phone. Then, when I took it to Verizon to activate it, the guy put me in a TWO-YEAR contract even though it was a NO CONTRACT phone. Next, I wanted to activate the EZ Navigator app while I was on an out-of-state trip. I was told I needed a software update which I could get at any Verizon Wireless store. I went to one store in Arizona and one store in Oklahoma, both of which told me they didn't do software updates on that phone anymore. Then, we discussed the possibility of upgrading to a new phone. That was when I found out the guy who activated the phone put me in a two-year contract with a no-contract phone. Then, I had to call Verizon and speak to various supervisors several times to convince them I wasn't even supposed to be in a contract so there shouldn't be an upgrade fee. Finally,  one person realized that I really was NOT supposed to be in a two-year contract so she changed the records. In spite of that, Verizon still wanted to charge me an upgrade fee.
