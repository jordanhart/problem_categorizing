One of his friends has a monthly plan and exceeded his monthly hours and was charged $150.  My co-worker's daughter exceeded her monthly hours and was charged $350.  If you don't want an unexpected, unwanted  additional phone overcharge go prepaid.Overall, my son really likes his phone and it takes good pictures.  He says the number 7 button sticks a little now but, the phone still works well.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice phone. Horrible hit-n-miss reception.", "Author": "DISenchanted", "ReviewID": "R1H6H4GHGKJKO1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I waited over a year to get a different pre-paid phone; one with a camera feature.[I had a nokia 1600 and it was a no frills phones, but it's reception was rather good, no matter where I took it. All across the USA, on trips and such.]The C261 takes about 1-2 minutes to:1. turn ON2. come up3. \"Search-for-network\"4. locate network, then be ready for talking.I understand it has a browser feature that my Nokia 1600 did not, butit's painful to wait on this thing to power up and become available for talking.I tried leaving the unit on, with powersaver functions all enabled.A couple days later I went to use it and it started up; then powered down  because it had run out of power.I notice that I have a lot more areas that have weak signals, or NO SIGNALS (the same areas the Nokia 1600 found adequate signals for phone service within).A very sorry phone.", "Date": "May 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "no juice", "Author": "Jack Nickleson", "ReviewID": "RDFSZ7QT09B1R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The original phone at full charge would run out of juice on \"standby\" in around 3 days. I replaced the battery with a newly purchased one and still the same. Don't know what part of this phone sucks the juice up like that.And you would never want to turn off the phone to conserve battery, because when you actually want to use it you would have to wait 1-2 min just for it to turn on and \"search for network.\"Camera works decently, but there's no direct way to transfer the pictures to your computer except by email/mms.The phone is only worth getting if it is free.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good phone in the Reno Nevada area", "Author": "FlyByNight \"FlyByNight\"", "ReviewID": "R1URCWRPEU6R7U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's simple and very sleek and has a lit keyboard.All and all very nice. The battery life is good. Build quality is good.Get the $139 double mins for \"Life of phone\" you can get the phone \"Free\" and 800 mins which in theory stick around for a year if you are careful. Not so bad.  I really have no complaints. If you order it online you have to sign for it which is annoying... Lucky I was at home when it got here. I don't want to make a special trip to UPS or wherever.To get the $139 deal you may have to get it from Tracfone. Maybe amazon has it? Keep in mind I DO NOT use a cell phone a lot. There may be better deals out there for you.Also the reception will be different in whatever area you are at.OK, that's pretty normal.From what I am seen read and re-read their \"deal\". Sometimes you don't get what you pay for. This phone is pretty much what it says it is.", "Date": "December 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Gift and Phone", "Author": "A.

He is saving a great deal more as opposed to his old monthly-contracted phone and will keep in touch with his family and friends for a fabulous low price. He really likes how easy it is to use and the cool features. I definitely reccommend this Tracfone phone to those trying to save and get a great deal in return :) its well worth the money!", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "grrrrr", "Author": "Kelly A.
