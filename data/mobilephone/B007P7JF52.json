{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The HTC EVO 3D...", "Author": "Irineo Placido-Lopez", "ReviewID": "R2BKACSJ0JXWED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alright everyone, this is a review on the HTC EVO 3D, one of my favorite phones aside from the iPhone from Apple. The Htc Evo 3D is a great phone that is perfect for anyone who wants a really nice phone. Now for the main review...The Display:The display on the Evo 3D is great on its 4.3 inch LCD screen. With a 540 x 960 qHD 3D Display its screen looks really nice. I posted some pictures of the phone's screen, flash, and text sharpness. Feel free to check those out to get an idea of how nice the screen of this phone looks. Note that this display looks great, but it can't compare to Apple's Retina Display.The Battery:With a rechargeable 1730 mAh Battery the battery life on the Evo 3D is O.K. It will last you an entire day with some occasional uses throughout the day. If you use the phone a lot you will have to recharge it again at least once throughout the day.The Camera:The phone has a 5 Mega Pixel Camera that is capable of taking some really nice photos in both normal and in 3D. The 3D does tend to hurt/bother the eyes from the people that I have asked. It does look nice, but if you are watching a movie/slide show in 3D you will probably have to take a break from the 3D to avoid bothering the eyes.Now when you first get the phone it is going to be running Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), you will have to update it various times in order to get the latest Android version. After you update your phone completely it will be running Android 4.03 (Ice Cream Sandwich). With the New Update come new looks to the phone. It also will upgrade to the new Google Play Store instead of the old Android Market. There are tons of new things in the Google Play store that the old version of Android did not have.Overall: If you want a good looking phone that takes amazing pictures in both regular and in 3D. This is a really nice phone. The battery life could be better, but considering it's a smart phone it is O.K. I would rate this 5 stars out of 5 stars.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply awesome", "Author": "ivysdad \"rushguy\"", "ReviewID": "RYEDN59XQ4PNR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "People writing bad reviews should save them for the seller and not the product, the EVO 3D is an amazing phone but a few people obviously bought some refurbs that were not in perfect working condition. The dual core processor in this phone is more than enough to run any apps and provide a smooth experience with no lag at any time. The phone feels nice and solid and couple with an Otterbox case will last you for years to come. The 3D pictures look amazing as well as 3D videos, haven't played any games but Spiderman looked very cool. When I wear my polarized sunglasses the screen shows off pretty rainbow colors lol. I came from an Evo 4G that I had for over a year and I was going to get an S3 but I got this phone from a friend for a hundred dollars and couldn't pass it up, its a huge leap from a single cored phone. I can't stop messing around with it, really a joy to use and as I said its powerful enough to run any task without hesitation.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "HTC EVO 3D", "Author": "Ruel A.

Within 6 months I had to have the front facing camera and the earpiece replaced, sinv they both simply stoped working. The battery life is pathetic, and can become very warm whole charging. Any moderate amount of use will drain it quickly. Restarting the phone becomes a must after around 6 months, as its interface becomes sluggish and I am often not able to even unlock it to make a call.

For $150 it was basically the cheapest \"mp3 player\" that had a touchscreen, wifi, flexible storage capacity, replaceable batteries, camera, and a dual core CPU. I don't use it as a phone because of its relatively high SAR rating (1.04 I believe) and also I don't feel like paying $20-30 for a data plan every month.PROS:-Dual core CPU, 1.2ghz each-720p HD recording-Decent capacity battery-Not too small, not too big-Good quality display-Ice Cream Sandwich functions well-Fast touch input response-Sound quality isn't too shabby-Decent camera (photos)-Good price (got mine refurbished for about 1/2 the retail price, came brand new basically with no blemishes whatsoever)CONS:-Video camera isn't amazing quality, zoom function barely works (only digital zoom, not optical), pictures and videos can be blurry in low light situations-Dual camera is kind of useless (3D function is neat but hurts my eyes)-Slightly heavier than expected, heavier than an iPhone-HTC Sense sucks-Touchscreen is a little TOO responsive at times... if you even hover your finger near the screen it might accidentally register it as a touch-Battery lasts about 1 day without charge of moderate to heavy use, or 2.5 days with light useMy biggest gripe with this device is that the camera could be of better quality. Instead of putting in a useless 3D feature, HTC should really have upped a single lens to 1080p or better optical/digital zoom with more consistent performance in low light areas.

It hurts your eyes to stare at it and isn't exactly 3d but I'd still say its pretty cool. What I really like is how much tougher the screen is than phones like the iPhone. I've dropped it to points where I thought there was no way the screen wasn't completely screwed, but it came out fine aside from a few little bumps and bruises. Other than that, it glitches a little but not nearly as bad as a lot of other touch screens, and I'd say I have no real problems with it. Internet works better on it than any other phone I've ever had (I've never had an iPhone though), and I never got the urge to throw it against the wall like I did with my Samsung Moment (awful, awful phone) and wanted to with a lot of others I had.

And expandable storage.It's the best multi-media device you can get. Better than the Galaxy S wifi.There are a few downsides. It is very big and heavy. Android OS is good but not as good as iOS. Just little things like page scrolling are not done as well. The Chrome browser does not work correctly on this device. The software keyboard when running chrome occasionally bugs out. The capacitive buttons I always end up hitting by accident and kicked out of the application I was running. Battery life isn't great even though it is so big. There is a lot of noise coming from the headphone jack. They apparently didn't properly ground it.That aside, this is a gem. 3d photography is really neat.

Junk.", "Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "R3RLKIHKDIRP0V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I saw that this vendor had a 99% positive rating, I figured I couldn't go wrong... Well I have never been more wrong in my life.I had a previous HTC EVO 3D bought using an upgrade from Sprint 6 months ago. Simply put, the phone was amazing in performance and in functionality. It was the perfect phone, never had an issue, and it went with me everywhere. One day, it decided to go swimming with me, which it didn't like so much...There is no point in me carrying insurance on a phone because in the past, and up until now, I have ALWAYS been careful with my phones, and the only type of damage I would have ever been concerned about is water damage (which, naturally, is what happened). HOWEVER, the fee for a replacement after water damage is either close to, as much as, or even HIGHER than the price of a new phone. I just figured it would make more sense to cut my losses and buy a new (used) phone. This looked like a great deal!IT'S NOT.The item says it's a phone. That's not very true. The microphone enabling me to talk to people hardly works, and when I try to use voice commands, it doesn't work at all. This renders the phone about as useful as a third generation ipod touch (NOT A PHONE) with a bad wifi connection.The device overheats when I use it for anything, and this seems to make battery life horrendous (40 minutes of low intensity use, 7 hrs of standby). I drained half the battery on a 10 minute call to Sprint customer service, who could barely hear me because the microphone isn't functioning properly. I think the energy use problems are a result of the seemimgly faulty refurb.I suppose I got what I paid for: a cheap knockoff in the sense that it doesn't work like a typical HTC EVO 3D (refurbished in Taiwan). Too bad it wasn't right for me. I hope the seller plans to do something to reimburse me for my time and anguish (half my life rests in a phone, as pathetic as it sounds... but it's how I reach my friends and family!!!). I wish they would test their phones completely before selling them.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Won't buy anymore from them!", "Author": "Not pleased customer!", "ReviewID": "R2SNVBK9LIADIW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Terrible item!

Despite having a dual-core processor, (which is why I bought the phone), the OS moves like it is churning butter.  Visuals are laggy, and the OS is slow to respond to commands.  I blame this on the bloatware fills this phone to the brim.2.  The WiFi connections are terrible.  My coworkers have had no problems with the WiFi in our office, but I can not get a signal.  This is replicated at internet cafes or other areas where WiFi is available.  I took this to a Sprint store because it must be a hardware issue, but they were not able to find any problems, just a low-quality wifi receiver.3.  The call quality is atrocious.  Be prepared to ask people to repeat themselves often.  Speech becomes garbled and sounds like an electronic remix of a fork in a garbage disposal.4.  The only thing more annoying than trying to use your phone to talk to people is trying to use your phone to listen to music using the headphone jack.  For some reason (demonic possession?), the phone seems to think that your headphones, which have no microphone attached to them at all, can transmit your voice.  As such, the phone CONSTANTLY tries to open the voice commands option included in the bloated OS.  If it can't open the Voice Commands app, it instead helpfully calls random people from your contacts, or, my personal favorite, begins playing the random awful music samples loaded inside the phone.Summary:  Don't buy.
