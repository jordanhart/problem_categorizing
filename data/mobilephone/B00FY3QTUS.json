(nothing wrong with iPhone except that it died and i needed a less expensive alternative)i am in college, do a lot of emails, web browsing, app usage, messaging, and using maps(cuz i can never find anything in this town)first off look at the specks- this phone is huge compared to an iPhone but very similar in it's build to a samsung galaxy. so if you don't want a big phone then this isn't for you. i didn't look at the size before ordering and was very mad at myself until i opened the box. this is a sleek phone with a bit of a grippy back casing; like what you would get with an incipio case. it is not heavy at all compared to it's size and it's very thin and well built. no rattling and no squeeks anywhere. back stays on well. screen is nice and bright and very clear. i honestly can't see a difference between this display and my iPhone. i have used the camera and the pictures come out fine; i don't use a phone for a camera religiously though. this is an android based phone which i love. the voice command and voice to text application come built in and are WAY BETTER than siri ever was for me. (the voice to text is an option while in the message screen) the phone volume is loud, music is crystal clear even in head phones and also in my car aux. i haven't had any issues yet and it's been about a month. if anything happens I'll update.so pros:good soundlight but durableclear screen/good displaygood software (easy to learn since I've never dealt with it)easy to set up and workeasy to text/ use touch screenonly con: was the size until i got use to it. (so easy to read on this phone and i can actually watch videos. i was so close to sending it back but i love it now)so in conclusion: great phone for the price. i really don't have any issues so far and I'm very pleased with my purchase. i got more than expected and i am pleasantly surprised.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Off-Brand Phone!  You won't regret your purchase!", "Author": "Gerren Jones", "ReviewID": "R2RZOY9B1TRPU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, I have to say that I am super impressed with this phone.  If your reading this review, you are probably just as skeptical as I was when considering buying an off-brand phone.  I don't write many reviews, but I always rely on others reviews so I want to help others with their hesitation to purchase this phone.  I switched to T-mobile to save a little cash from being a Verizon customer for many years.  First, the shipping was really fast, which was one of the reasons I got this phone after looking at other unlocked phones; this was available for Prime shipping.Now for the meat and potatoes...once I turned the phone on, it started the normal Android first use process.  And since I was going from a Note 2, I already had Google information.  The phone was set up with my info in about 3 minutes and started downloading the apps I had on the Note 2.  Then went to T-mobile to purchase a sim card ($10).  They entered my info activated the sim card and the phone was up and running in about 2 minutes.  Full bars and 4G!!  I've been playing with the phone for about 2 days now and everything is good to go with no problems.  Only problem I had was transferring my number from Verizon and that had nothing to do with the phone itself, but the process of porting a phone number between companies.If I had to give any dislikes, I have 2...which isn't a deal breaker to me.  One is that the phone doesn't have a lot of storage, but I added a 16gb micro sd and that dislike is solved.  This phone will take as much as a 64GB micro card by the way.  And the second dislike would be the camera.  And I'm only comparing it to the Note 2 since that what I switched from.  But like I said, not a deal breaker for me.  This phone says 5.0 mega autofocus on the camera.Overall I'm very happy with this phone and I don't think I'll get a name brand phone ever again when I look at the cost comparison.  This phone works about 98% as good as my old Galaxy Note 2 and I love Samsung products.  Just not Samsung prices.  If you have read this far of my review, go on and buy the phone.  You won't regret it.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Know your item?", "Author": "NoBiasGene", "ReviewID": "R237E4I4HTMQI1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have read the reviews for this item and find them to be valid at points and also wrong at others. When purchasing read through the details first, this item comes in two version d610a and d610i (check the back of your phone). The a version means American and will work excellent with any carrier, if you choose the I version that stands for international which works but not to full expectancy... Reason being your data connection only is capable of 2g causing a unhappy customer... So read before you buy to avoid this error", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bang for your buck!", "Author": "Bradley T.", "ReviewID": "RNJX6KI1BM7VP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am posting this after using the phone for 24 hours:Looks: Straight out of the box the phone looks like a name brand phone. Sleek, subtle, and straight to the point.First Use: I put my (AT&T;) SIM card into the phone and booted it up. I went through the 3 minutes Android/Google setup and viola! everything was working. I just had to add the settings to get my multimedia text working. Everything else worked automatically, even data. (I had read from another reviewer that it didn't get 4G speeds but I don't think he understands the difference betweeen 4G and LTE. I am very happy with the (data) speed of the phone.) The screen isn't super clear but it is very nice for what you pay. The camera was also sub par but once again you get what you pay for. The quadcore  processor is very responsive and leaves very little time for lagging.Overall: I paid $170(something) for an unlocked 5.5 inch (screen size) Android device and can not complain. If you want a replacement phone without renewing your contract or paying $500+ for an unlocked device, this is what I would purchase. Before reviewing the phone remember that you are reviewing a $170 phone, not a Note 3. If anything changes over the next few weeks I will update the review but has of today I am extremely happy.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK this is a beautiful phone - Samsung & iPhone\u2026watch out!", "Author": "DeerBusters?", "ReviewID": "RNSJZO6Y7NBAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Almost identical to Samsung Galaxy Note in size, big beautiful screen, extra large fonts, easy to navigate, and setupThis phone IS 4GThis phone picks up wi-fiThis phone works with Consumer Cellular AARPIt has 2 places for the regular SIM chip (no, you don't need a nano-SIM chip)I had iphone 4s and it was tiny compared to this giant mammoth touchscreen!!!So as a 1st-time android user, i had this running in 1 day (same day arrived in mail) with a new carrier, new phone and new square trade 1-year accident protection plan for $29.99This phone comes with a 1-yr manufacturer warranty, screen protector, earphones, manual, american charger & international plug adapter for charging.My phone bill will now include 15,000 texts, 1Gig Data and 1,000 minutes - all for about $30My husband is buy a BLU phone next, this TOP10Cellular Seller was also extra nice.

I wanted a reasonably priced phone that was capable of most things.The screen is quite large and looks good, the sensor for auto-brightness adjusting is very sensitive and responsive. It seems to hold a charge for a decent amount of time and so far everything I have installed seems to be running smoothly and loading quickly. The front camera could be better, I didn't expect much so I'm by no means disappointed in it. Calls sound good. It's a really good phone for the price, a capable smartphone that isn't 400 bux. I've had it for a few days and so far I love it. The gps works well for zombie running and didn't drain the battery as much as I would have thought. It is also capable of picking up wifi from a pretty good distance, this is the only device I have that works in my kitchen (farthest room from my router). The phone came with a bumper case, charger and a screen protector. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c it takes longer to charge fully than I would like and b/c there is no dedicated camera button on the body of the phone (but you can swipe to it from the lock screen really quickly)---Update 06/01/2014---I've had this phone for a while now and the bumper has come in handy more than I would have thought, I've dropped this phone more than I should have and thanks to the bumper case it is still intact. Also the phone seems to take a beating pretty well, as I said above this phone has been dropped multiple times including once into a puddle face down (I grabbed it immediately and removed the battery and let it hang out in a baggie of uncooked rice and it's still working as well as when I got it.)The video wallpaper option runs the 720p video I chose very smoothly.I use it at work to listen to music through headphones for about 8 hrs a day. If I don't make a lot of calls it will keep a charge for a full day, sometimes two.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "Splinterfinger", "ReviewID": "R3I3HYC25BO123", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do not jump into the newest tech, (I know, this is not the \"newest\" tech), because I am unwilling to pay the newest tech prices but when my old phone started ending calls at random times and even powering down whenever it wanted I decided it was time to retire the old clamshell. (See how with-it I am?) I hate phone contracts so I wanted an unlocked phone and started to look around. Blu has mostly good reviews so I went with with this one. At about 1/4 the price of a Note 3 I give up a little on the CPU and on the screen resolution but feel the screen is clear and easy to read. I am not a gamer so I cannot address how that works. I use it for GPS, calendar, Evernote, and some web info when I am away from the house. I use a DSLR when I need to take pics but I have played with the camera a little and it is only okay. You might find the camera lacking if you want to use it for most of your photos and you want to print them out any larger than a 5X7. Overall this phone works really well for me. Android without a lot of the bloat-ware and hundreds of thousands of apps to choose from. I use TM for my service and they not only gave me a new SIM card because my old one was too old to be compatible but they transferred my info off the old phone for me in about 5 minutes.

Okay, just wanted to update my latest success with this phone.  The phone is Awesome!  It runs everything thrown at it and I've not yet found any app on Google that says incompatiable.  I'm thrilled to report that Google Chromecast works flawless on this.  I don't know why anybody would want any other phone.  If you are in the 50 and older crowd, you will appreciate the clear bright and LARGE screen.  It's the ideal size for accomplishing almost anything and this is the phone you can actually see well enough to do some web browsing, emailing and more.  I have not hat one single glitch on both my wifes and my own phone.  Buy it!April 14th 2014 Update, bought a 2nd one.  This is for my wife and is using an AT@T unlimited reseller plan.  She's got unlimited talk, text and 1/2 gig of web.  My facebook crazy wife never uses more than about 400mb per month so she's good on the unlimited AT@T plan.  We're paying $27.00 per month ...  beats all deals!Phones, have been dropped, rained on,  and once accidentially left on my dash and was hotter than you could hold from the heat of the sun. Was sure the phone would have fried or at least been non-operational from the 140+ degrees heat from that sun on the dash.. Phone worked flawless.  Must have a monster heat sink desgin on the cpu or it's just a well balanced phone!  Again, get it, you won't regret it!  Also.... a comment about videos being pixelated from youtube.  That's not likely an issue with the phone.  Bandwitch limits might pixelate the stream, the phone is solid.UPDATE:  See original review below:This just keeps getting better for me.  FYI,  framaroot 1.9.1 will gain root for this device on the first try.  My blu studio 5.5 is running like a champ and with root access I can run an amazing number of vital apps like Android Lost, and others, that let you track your phone when lost or even zero out the data if lost for good.  Root access is amazing in what your android can do!Folks,  I've seen mostly positive reviews and a few critical reviews on this phone.  I am not sure where the critical reviews come from.  I consider this a near flawless implementation of a huge 5.5\" clear bright screen.  If you are a ordinary cell user like myself,  you will not find any limits in this phones capacity.  Maybe it performs slightly slower per some other tests that were run but unless you are in some kind of highly intense application that is not typical for a phone, you will not notice any speed issues.  I see none in my ordinary use for texting, google voice, email, phone calls, etc.  This phone is awesome!  It is the best deal and the best phone I've ever ordered.  We have it connected to Tmobile using a third party carrier and I get full web and data access for $10.00 per 2 months on a pay as you go plan.  On the Tmobile third party carrier I use,  $10.00 buys me 200 anytime minutes or 599 Texts or 100 MBytes of data, and you have up to 2 months to use the $10.00.  You can auto recharge ever time the $10.00 is used up.  My cost is averaging about $5.00 per month allowing this phone's WIFI to take over for free calls and data when wifi is near.  This is an incredible smart phone and can be used in an incredibly inexpensive way.  To get the free WIFI calls, you'll need to install Google Voice from Play.google and of course set up a Google Voice phone number.  Configure the settings in Google Voice then turn off your DATA from your carrier to test the app to use WIFI only to place and receive calls.  These calls on WIFI are off your minute plan.  They are free on WIFI.  Same with Google Text.  This is how I get my service for about $5.00 per month on a SmartPhone.Additional info contained in comments for this reviewAlso, I should mention that you may have to manually add your APN after inserting your SIM card.  The SIM card will give you voice and text, but data may not work until you select your carrier in the setup menu.  In my case, I had to enter the APN info for my Tmobile reseller.Update:  You may want to get this case from AMAZON while you order.  It's a really nice protective case.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HVV9I9K/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Blu Studio 5.5", "Author": "YOLANDA DAVIS", "ReviewID": "R2UJ0ZZEK7W7C8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted the Galaxy Note and couldnt afford it.

So I research several phone companies, and at all costs I avoided getting AT&T.; At this rate I wasn't going to switch to a plan so I was stuck with a GSM phone for about a year and a half. I researched all the phones that were unlocked on Walmart and found the Blu phones.First I was going to go for the Blu Dash, but I had got additional cash and went ahead, decided on the Blu Studio 5.3 or the 5.5. I bought this.I was very skeptical because I didn't think this phone would be all that, and almost $200 down the drain making me regret buying phones here. But I was wrong.I was very surprised when the seller shipped it to me in less than 3 days and realized this phones is HUGE. Five and a half inches. A fourth sticks out my back pocket and it's as big as my hand from my wrist to my middle finger tip. Smooth white, monstrous battery, earphones (don't use because they don't fit me), a manual, and the charger. I thought it would come with the case too but it didn't.I booted the phone after putting in my SIM and battery and it has the lovely BLU logo and it makes you go through the setup for the phone. Very basic, very simple, very fluid. I played around with it for an hour and I was in love with it.Pros:- If you're a big screen lover, this is for you. 5.5 Inches.- Battery life. If you use it ever so often for about 5-10 hours in the day, you're only going to go down probably in the 70% (I play games and my battery stays above 60%) But this could compete with other Androids.- Sensitivity. Screen navigation is smooth and sleek.- With a GSM, if you're on a generic trackphone plan, congratulations; unlimited data. My phone detects 0.00B when I clearly used almost half a gig in a couple of days on my SIM.- Back camera works decently, clear if you take good shots.- Exceeds working as an Android on an older version.Unfortunately there are the cons:-Front camera. If you're a selfie maniac, you're going to hate this camera. It cannot take shots flawlessly like the backside and you have to be very still to get a semi-clear shot. Otherwise, it will blur like crazy. But it still functions, but not to par for those who like taking those great selfies.- Storage. This was my biggest concern because I like a device with a lot of space. The description says the device was 4GB, yet I go to the settings and it says I only have less than 2GB of free space. The setting was also confusing because they had two sections where one was Phone and System. But the free space I looked at gone down tremendously since I got it, so I'm buying a microSD for expansion. If you're someone who likes storage, beware this phone does not comes with that at all. Get a SD card!- SIM: For some reason, my sim acts almost non-existent to my device. I would save contacts on there, yet I can't upload a picture of them on there. It has to be saved to the phone. Nor I could transfer them to the phone. Also, I have this bug with the SIM (even since my last phone) that I would always have voicemail, but could never call them. It would disconnect me. So the phone would display I have voicemail where I cannot call it.This generally looks like I'm bashing the device, but I'm stating my experience with it so far and specific aspects.

When I opened the box, I was so happy at the size of the screen and the fact the phone was light. I had read the specs from BLU, so I already went and purchased a 64 mem card for it. The first thing I tried was the camera, as it was only 5MP/16M I knew it wouldn't be the best, but surprisingly my photo wasn't as badly pixelated as I thought it would be...but it still doesn't do as great as the Samsung cameras. I then synced over my apps, and that's where I fell in love. It did it flawlessly, & I still had space for my music and videos. Works great with my PTel sim card, and my calls are clear. Been playing with it since yesterday, and just now getting to 70%. A major plus compared to Samsung battery life. I like the Samsung Mega, and this phone is exceptionally close to that. I must admit, I was a little skeptical and thought I'd be returning this phone, but its definitely a keeper.

Works with Straight Talk, for both for the AT&T; and T-Mobile (mini) SIM cards.2.  I like the inclusion of the \"OneClean\" garbage collection widget.  This must be the first time I've fallen in love with a piece of bloatware!3.  It is compatible with the Google Device Management client.Cons:1.  The \"Encryption\" settings are missing from the \"Security\" menu.  I have written an email to BLU asking them to confirm this, and they replied that it does not, \"at this time.\"  Hopefully, it means that they will consider re-enabling this functionality, since it is a part of the stock Android 4.2 capability.2.  Will not \"honor\" default app launch settings.  Try getting the Contacts app that comes with it to launch Chomp SMS, for instance!3.  The SMS rate limit is set too low.  Power texters will frequently encounter the pop-up dialog \"Messaging is sending a large amount of messages!  Block or Allow\"4.  The ENTIRE back of the case seems to double as the internal speaker diaphragm; there are no grills or cutouts for the internal speaker!  If you expect to hear your speakerphone conversations, MP3 ringtones and other media; don't place the phone on a soft surface!!!!Tips:1.  They include a screen protector in the box, but if you are careful, you can peel off the \"sticker\" from the film they placed on the front of the phone, and then cut off the \"pull here\" tab.  Then you will have two screen protectors!***** UPDATE 2013-12-23 *****Still liking the phone.  Only reason for 4 stars is lack of encryption on the Security settings menu.  No excuse for that, for units sold in the USA.  Also, because of Con #2, which I just discovered.Kudos to Amazon Customer Support!  The price went down by $8 in the 7 days since I purchased the phone, from this seller.  Amazon refunded me the difference.  Note: this \"price guarantee\" policy is only good for the first 7 days after you PLACE AN ORDER.***** UPDATE 2013-12-24 *****I got around the default app launch problem by purchasing DW Contacts & Dialer Pro from the Amazon AppStore for $4.89, and received an email telling me I qualified for a $5 credit for future app purchases.  So I came out $0.11 ahead!DW Contacts Phone Dialer Pro***** UPDATE 2013-12-30 *****Still happy with the phone.  I found the Kroo Clutch Wallet for Smartphones works reaslly well as a case:B00CMNZEAE***** UPDATE 2013-12-31 *****I tried paring a Plantronics M50 to the phone.  It pairs nicely and everything, but if you turn off the Bluetooth, walk out of range, or turn off the headset; the phone retains no memory of the pairing.  You are then forced to repair the devices.*****UPDATE 2014-01-02*****I think the Bluetooth pairing issue is related to the firmware.  I tried pairing a Motorola T215 to the phone and it had absolutely no problems.  But for the life of me, I can't get the phone to \"remember\" being paired with the Plantronics M50.\"Messaging is sending a large amount of messages!  Block or Allow\"  I've lowered my rating to only 3 stars, because the SMS rate limit for this particular device seems to be unusually low.  Per the discussions on the Google Code forum, this limit is baked into the ROM and can only be changed by the manufacturer.  And while the intent of the SMS rate limit is understandable, the value in the current V06 ROM from BLU seems to be set too low.*****UPDATE 2014-01-03*****Something \"odd\" is going on.  If the phone goes for more than 65 hours straight of \"up time,\" a condition exists, in which the phone is no longer able to play any system related sounds, ringtones or notifications.  The only recourse is to reboot the phone.  This has happened twice so far.*****UPDATE 2014-01-05*****I received the following e-mail message from BLU, concerning the Bluetooth pairing issue I've been having: \"We apologize for the inconvenience, however while all our device do have bluetooth (sic) 4.0 Technology, we can not garauntee (sic) the compatibility with all devices.\"Seems to me that BLU has been \"Muntzing\" (see Wikipedia) the Android too much.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's good till now.

At 5 inches, the pixels show and smaller text is hard to read.- Screen has color warping and color inversion if you view it from any angle greater than about 20 degrees above/below the center while in portrait mode. For normal use in portrait mode, you probably won't notice. However, if you use your phone in landscape mode (like games), it becomes much more noticeable.- Camera is so-so. Colors are good, but pictures are often washed out with low contrast. The pictures also have a lot of artifacts. I'm not sure if it's because the phone saves the pictures as low quality jpeg, or if it's the camera.- The version of Android installed is just the generic build of Android. The default OS has none of the bling some of the other phones have. Yes, you can install all the Android mods you want to make it awesome, but don't expect it to look great out of the box.Bottom line: if you're looking for a solid phone at a good price, the Blu Studio 5.5 will be tough to beat. However, if any of the above \"cons\" concern you, you'd be better off spending a little more to get what you want.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone love it!

You can read my review on the BLU Studio 5.3 and it is lengthy. hat really stands out about his phone is that it has a 1GB Ram which is twice the RAM, little larger screen and you can increase the memory to 64 GB with a Micro SD card. Like the Studio it was so easy to download apps for the bank and Instant Messenger, Facebook and on and on.No need to worry about memory being robbed and slowing down your speed with twice as much Ram. WIFI worked so well and fast. This smart phone is like a mini computer. The Android 4.2 and Quad Core really make the difference. The camera is wonderful and gives side by side video calls too with the front facing camera. These android phones are really setting the bar much higher and with the reasonable price they should make a big hit on the market......Jamie Jansen", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the money.", "Author": "L.

I simply put my AT&T; go phone sim card in and it picked up the AT&T; settings . The phone itself is awesome running android 4.2 . When I set up the phone it recieved an OTA update from the manufacturer which was a nice change from the norm with AT&T; rarely updating android OS . The shipping on the other hand was less than awesome . Fedex smartpost quite simply is HORRIBLE. They delayed the ship date 2 times while in transit so rather than getting it on the 9th , I finally got it on the 13th .

(Literally, it has 4x the ram and 2x the cores.) The front camera is basically non-existant, it's just ok, but the back camera actually takes higher quality pictures than the screen can even show, same with video. Screen is awesome, people say pixel density is low, but honestly how much can your eye even see once it gets into the hundreds? The Blue colored one is SWEET. You WILL want to buy probably a TPU case which is about $7 more seperate but worth it. Comes with screen protector which works if you do the rubbing alcohol thing, all in all, this is perfect.

I had no difficulties with the phone so far. The camera works very well and the video is amazing. I put a straight talk T-Mobile sim card it and I had trouble activating it. The only down side was on straight talk part. I paid $130 for a three month unlimited subscription. Well, when I did it online it didn`t go through the first time when I paid. But I called Straight Talk and they activated my sim card for me, but they also said that the $130 three month plan did not go through on the internet. So the guy had me purchase another three month plan. When I checked my bank account I noticed my account had been charged twice. But they said the money will be back on tomorrow. So overall it was a great purchase and have no bad remarks so far. I do recommend checking your local cell phone providers to make sure which one has the best service in your area. I didn`t do that and now I have bad service through T-Mobile. But it does have two sim card slots, so I`ll just purchase a Straight Talk At&t; sim card.

I called back later from another phone and was able to get another Tmobile rep who told me the codes.  Now I have internet access however it is only 2G.I still like the phone.

Be that as it may the jellybean os on this phone is very nice and the best of all the android os's you will come across to date.  Looking past the OS this phone works with AT&T; phone sims as well as the Tablet sims and yes their is a difference. The phone sims allow for data as well as phone calling features but cost more whereas the tablet sims allow data only features but can support phone calling features through other apps avalible on the android app store like talkatone, talkfree etc. just do a search for phone apps they will pop up. But the native phone system is still better over all. I have looked at other android devices before that just don't work with US carriers but this one does work with at least AT&T; cell and tablet sims. Plus its smoken fast being quad core.
