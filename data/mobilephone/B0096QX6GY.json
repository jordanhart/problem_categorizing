First of all, when I saw that this phone was $50 to $150 less than many other new smartphones on the market I thought there was a significant trade-off.  Well, after about 24 hours of VERY heavy usage and research I have yet to find one other than the lack of HDMI output--which I don't use.  The design is very nice and the quality of the screen is beautiful.  It took a little while getting used to the new OS features and settings, but only because I was coming off an older phone with Android v. 3.  I love the ability to multi-task on this, by selecting from multiple screens, and that Chrome is installed as the default browser.  Also, if you have an old X or Razr, your cords will work with this phone.  Some of you may have known that, I was very happy to learn it.  The camera is MUCH easier to use than the one on the X.  There isn't as much of a lag when snapping photos, and the quality is pretty good for a smartphone.  C'mon! If you want poster quality, get a digital camera!  I have bluetooth in my car and the set-up on this phone was a breeze.  No complaints on call quality either.The only bad things I can say are about the battery (only slightly better than most smartphones, definitely not a deal-killer) and the location of the on/off button above the volume control. Also, there is no 'home' key for taking you back to the main home screen like X had (only a minor personal annoyance).  The pre-installed ringtones are pretty terrible, but this is a non-issue as there are plenty of free alternatives on the Android market.Bottom line:  A great phone for anyone looking to upgrade, or just starting out in the smartphone sphere.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Droid Razr M (mini)", "Author": "Mr. B", "ReviewID": "R3VAKYW1O2ME2X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In a nut shell, Moto took the Razr Maxx (minus the battery)and smashed it into this beautiful and small case.Cons: The battery life is not as good as the Maxx, but destroys the standard Razr.Pros: All the great things the Razr Maxx can do, but in a smaller package while maintaining the same screen size.Bottom line: Biggest bang for the buck on the market!", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone.. iphone killer", "Author": "Drew Degraff", "ReviewID": "R1M3VETRFFV3P2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First the bad, as everyone knows cameras aren't Moto's strong point. It's not a bad camera, it's just not as good as some of the others. But for what I use it for, it's great.There strength is reception and all calls are crystal clear.  Haven't had a drop call yet.I didn't want a behemoth phone to carry around. This phone is just the right size. Fits in your palm, fits in your pocket ,and the price fits my budget. I'm sure some will have it free by Black Friday. The battery life is great, streamed pandora for 3 hours and I'm still at 73%. But that is really dependent on your proximity to towers, but it's much better than my previous Droid Pro. it would be dead now, and it was only a 3g phone. This phone includes a full version of Chrome, and it syncs bookmarks between it and your home and work computers. I love it. Download a flashlight app and you will be able to light up your front yard. This puppy is bright. The picture quality is amazing. The customization is great. It has what they call \"smartactions\", I call them triggers. I programmed it to start Pandora, when it connects to my car over Bluetooth. There are many triggers you can program. Button placement is good, it feels good in the hand, and love the fact it is splash proof. Oh, and the navigation is awsome, sounds like a real person with this version.Another great new feature is talk and surf at the same time, something you couldn't do with older phones unless you were on AT&T.;  Now I can look up stuff on the internet will I'm talking to someone.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Droid RAZR M vs. Samsung Galaxy S3", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1EZ8RBOW4YDY7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I first bought the Samsung Galaxy S3, while my wife got an Iphone 5. I found the size of the Samsung unwieldy, and the battery life atrocious. I couldn't get through the day without plugging it in, and I'm not a heavy telephone user. I also couldn't work it well with just a thumb while driving...the Sammy is a 2-handed phone. Finally, the Samsung had trouble connecting to wifi in some areas where the Iphone 5 had no problem. For these reasons, I returned it.The RAZR M is just the opposite. Yesterday, I unplugged the phone at 9am. I had Bluetooth and Wifi on all day. I live in a bad service area, with 2 bars of 3G or 1 bar of 4G, and it seems to oscillate between the two, and this is exactly what is supposed to be a major battery drain. I made a couple calls over BT and downloaded and listened to several podcasts via wifi. Also installed a couple apps. When I went to plug it in at 9pm, the battery was still at 75%. That is simply amazing.In addition, the phone is much easier to carry in a pocket and hold in the hand than the Samsung...basically the same size as the Iphone 5. Working it one-handed is no problem...seems to be the perfect size. The case also seems much better-built and stronger than on the Sammy or the Iphone (the Iphone is known to scratch).The RAZR M has the same 1.5 GHz processor as the Sammy, but only 1GB of RAM instead of the Sammy's 2GB. I run a lot of apps and didn't notice any difference in performance. Tests show the Iphone 5 to be the fastest on the market right now, but I honestly don't see any difference in performance between my wife's Iphone 5 and either the Sammy or the RAZR M.At 960x540, the screen resolution on the RAZR M isn't as good as the Sammy's 1280 x 720 or the Iphone's 1136 x 640, but I don't watch videos on my phone and didn't really notice the difference. If you really need a big screen, go for the new RAZR HD and HD MAXX. These have the Sammy's big screen, but with the rest of the features of the RAZR and RAZR M, including the outstanding battery life.For you world travelers, the RAZR M is global-ready, like the Iphone5...buy a SIM card when you get to the new country and replace the Verizon one.You might think the 8GB max. internal storage might be a problem...especially since, as with the Sammy, you can't offload apps to the microSD card. Surprise! I have a LOT of apps. I loaded them all and they only took less than 1GB of internal storage, so it wasn't really a limitation after all. In addition, you can still put all your photos, videos, etc. on the SD card.About my only complaint is that the white RAZR M has a black foreground around the screen, inside the white case. Result: If you put a black case around it, you no longer have a white phone (unless the case is white, obviously). The Iphone and the Samsung white models look sharp with a different-color case against the white foreground...there is no such contrast with the white RAZR M.Overall, this is easily the best phone I've owned, and I'm happy to recommend it to you. Best of all, it is AT LEAST $100 cheaper than the Iphone 5 or the Galaxy S3.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "The very smart phone", "Author": "Jacob W. Morgan \"JMorg\"", "ReviewID": "R31Y9GMG2IFN86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally upgraded to the Razr Maxx after having the HTC Thunderbolt for a year and I was pleased with it other than the fact that the phone is HUGE. So, when the Razr M came out it seemed perfect for my needs. I am a very experienced Droid user and I think this phone is great. My sister just got the Iphone 5 and has yet to find a feature on her phone (other than SIRI) that my phone doesn't have. In fact, the google maps on my phone is waaaay better than her maps. Not to mention that on Droids you get free GPS navigation (not paying attention to data costs). All that being said I will list out the pros and cons. With any phone there will be both.Pros:-OS is lightening fast-Screen is crystal clear (do not get matte screen protector if you care about screen clarity)-Weight is very light, especially for the monster battery (Iphone 5 is lighter, but the battery life pales in comparison)-Battery life is great, I used a ton of data, I am on the phone for work and personal use constantly, I watch Youtube, stream spotify, go on facebook, email, you name it. My battery last 2 days.-Screen size is great, I like how small the phone is yet I can watch videos with 4.3 inch screen in HD!-Phone size is small and thin, whole new world of large screened phones.-Fully customizable like all Droids-Beautiful sleek look, aluminum border, kevlar backing, Corning gorilla glassCons:-because the border is aluminum painted black it will show silver at the edges of the screen with time, but no biggy-not a huge selection of cases and covers available, which is to be expected with any brand new phone-Smart actions app doesn't always work and drains a significant amount of battery life. Cool idea, but it just uses to much power-Now to the only really bad part-For some reason the camera program that comes preloaded in the Razr M doesn't take good pictures at all! But there is a solution my fellow droid users, go to google play store and download ICS+ Camera app. It is only $2.99 and takes perfect pictures. Also it adds a panoramic picture taking function to the phone (Iphone 5 already has preloaded, but o well)Wrap up:All in all, great phone! Best Droid on the market when you consider, screen size, weight, size of phone, os, and battery life. I highly recommend it and let me know if you have any more questions. This was just a general description, but I have info about down and upload speeds, hotspot speeds and camparisons to the Iphone 5.Get this very smart phone!", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Childish Wonder", "Author": "Brendan O'Leary", "ReviewID": "RT3GWKLIYOXEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Honestly-- I haven't felt such a child-like sense of wonder since I was... well... a child. I just turned in my Droid BIONIC to upgrade to the Droid RAZR M and I couldn't be more excited! The phone is comfortable, well-built, EXTREMELY fast, and has all the bells and whistles. Most impressive, I think, is the SmartActions functionality. Not only can you program your phone to run all your standard functions automatically... but it even recognizes patterns in behavior and recommends SmartActions without even telling it to! This is much more than just a smartphone... it is intuitive to its user and adapts itself to be your perfect phone. The battery is much improved over my old BIONIC as well. And for the price???? It feels like grand theft larceny. Snap this up before it becomes a highly sought-after commodity. This is it.Summary: This is my 4th Droid and easily the best purchase I've ever made. It stands head and shoulders above any device I've played with (save for the S3) but at an impossibly low price point.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "razr m....great phone...GET A CLASS 4 SD CARD!!!..coming from iphone 3gs", "Author": "Downs", "ReviewID": "R3T7Z7BQIHFSN9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Previous phone was an iphone 3gs. I had it since it came out. I am not one to buy a new phone just becuz the new version is out. Apple did not break any new ground with their updated phones so I stayed with the 3gs. After time android caught up and surpassed  iOS in my opinion. I was tired of iOS but android was also an unknown.  After considerable research in best bang for buck and my 3gs refused to recognize all the charging cords I had for it I pulled the trigger on the Razr M shortly after it was released.  Amazon had it for $50 and that was a hell of a deal to me. Amazon has it for .01 cents now. Wow!!!In short its a great awesome phone and I love it. Get it. Its a breathe of fresh air compared to iOS. It's small and sleek, has a great screen, and hasn't dropped a call yet. Read on for the negatives.  There is a learning curve. If you are remotely tech savy its easy and refreshing. If not, than stick with iOS. I don't mean that as a knock on iOS. Apple products are just easier. Rudimentary but easy. Anyways, I had big problems dealing with SD cards. Major hassle. I sent 2 phones back to Amazon becuz of issues. Let me explain.  The 1st phone I received from Amazon had fingerprints and gunk on it. WTH? I called them and asked them if they sent me a refurbed phone. They said they dont do that but they would replace the one I had via the 30 day return policy. I never even turned it on. I just put it back in the box, printed the return label, sealed it, and sent it back.  The 2nd phone arrived. It came in a cushioned envelope... not an Amazon box. Odd i thought, but it was still in the Motorola box and was at least clean. I turned it on and I was happy. Until......  I had it for about 2 days and loved playing with my new phone. Then I decided to get a micro SD card for it. 16gb class 10 for about $20 at Fry's. I put the SD card in. Everything was ok until  I decided to take a picture and set the default to save to the external SD card. Bad news kid. Phone crashed and locked up. The phone hated the SD card. I exchanged the micro SD card at Fry's thinking it was messing up my phone. No dice on the new card. Phone kept locking up. Bought a new Sandisk SD card from Office Depot thinking the off brand was the culprit. Phone locked up again and kept doing so. In desperation I reformatted the phone. I got the hang of doing so everytime it crashed. Which was every time I tried to access the external memory. I was pissed. So.....  Called Amazon and complained thinking maybe I got a bum phone. What luck huh? Begrudgingly they agreed to send a 3rd one. Kudos to Amazon I suppose. 3rd phone arrived. In preparation I researched online about my problem. It was a 2-3 week old phone so not much was out there about it. I read a little about micro SD cards and came across a thread about the SD card and how the phone was tested using a class 4 SD card. I bought one at Office depot for about $16. 16gb, class 4 micro SD card, and waited for my phone to arrive. Crossing fingers and trying to get my 3gs to charge.  Phone came. New Amazon box, new Motorola box, clean phone. So far so good. Popped the 16gb class 4 micro SD card in and fired the phone up. Took a picture with the default set to save to the external SD card and crossed my fingers............  Its been a little over 2 months now and I love this phone. The lesser classed SD card did the trick. It takes pics fine and saves to the SD card fine and fast. With the class 10 SD card the phone would lock up every time an app would try to access it. Now with the class 4 SD card, everything is fine and this phone is awesome and I mean that in a tech way. Its sleek, sturdy, and high tech.  I even bought the Motorola car dock and use the Smart Actions. I learned how to use Smart actions and vehicle mode. I updated to Jelly Bean. This phone amazes like watching your dog behave in public. Jelly Bean and Smart Actions make this phone do tricks you wouldn't expect. Sometimes u have to setup some stuff up but doing so helps it learn you faster. I love the android Navigation and Jelly Bean voice. I find ways to use the Navigation. The android voice gives directions as if I had my own personal Cortana!Sorry for the long review but I hope this rant helps some who might have had problems with the SD card thing as well. Get a class 4 or similiar card and be happy with this phone. I am.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great alternative to the Galaxy S3", "Author": "Justin T. Melanson \"Sun Quan\"", "ReviewID": "R3AY39PPA9AK74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying I was a Sprint customer for 3 years, during that time, their service went from great to serviceable to downright crappy. I had initially wanted to ditch Sprint the moment I found out I was screwed over for even a partial upgrade last year, I was PO-ed when I found out they switched their upgrade cycle once again to a straight-up 20 months and did nothing to rectify the situation. Originally wanting to go with T-Mobile, I instead opted to get on Verizon since my uncle had a line available. I waited until my contract with Sprint was up, which was literally about 13 days ago, before I took the plunge. I also had my eye on the Galaxy S3 too, but I was so desperate to get off of Sprint that I did look at alternative phones. Imagine my pleasant surprise when I came across the Droid RAZR, and then the RAZR M shortly afterward.Originally I was thinking of getting the RAZR, but imagine my double surprise when I found out I could get 135 bucks on my trade-in towards the RAZR M by trading in my HTC EVO 4G, a phone I reviewed on here a while back. My uncle okayed the transfer, and I was good to go. I am happy to say that the difference between Sprint and Verizon is night and day! I don't worry about dropped calls anymore at my house, since I no longer have to struggle to get a signal, I usually get two to three solid bars. With Sprint I was lucky to get one bar, and it was on \"digital roaming\", three bars came and went too. 4G LTE on Verizon is readily available and is as quick as greased lightning, to say Sprint is lagging in this area would be an understatement. Also, if I use WiFi at a hotspot like Dunkin' Donuts or McDonald's or in my house, I can disable Mobile Data effectively eliminating the prospect of going over the allotted data plan and the like, and still do the things I like doing on this badboy such as searching on the 'net, Facebook, etc.Also, while people criticize the cheap feel of the bezel of the phone because of the visible screws on the sides, honestly, I don't pay attention to the screws at all. I am more impressed with the fact that the bezel is almost non-existent, and I find the phone to be sleak, sexy, and feather light.  It almost feels non-existant in my pocket at times because it's so light. And yet it sports a 4.3\" Super AMOLED qHD Display, and I feel personally it's screen is so much better than the EVO 4G I had before. Yes, I know it's not as good as the screen on say the Galaxy S3, but to me it is a massive step up from what I had before. The battery life on the thing is superb. Had it off it's charger for a solid 12 or so hours one day, and with heavy use, the thing was still holding strong at 35%. With the EVO 4G I was lucky to get half that.I was told by the salesperson that the RAZR M sported a dual-core 1.2 GHz processor, but did more research and found out it uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 chip, the exact same chip employed by the Galaxy S3. I was wondering why games were so ridiculously smooth, playing Angry Birds on this thing when compared to the EVO? Again, night and day. Smooth like butter, not a trace of slowdown. Yes, it doesn't have 2 Gigs of RAM like the S3, but for what it has, it does a wonderful job. Android Ice Cream Sandwich is also strikingly easy to use once you get down to the nitty gritty of it. I love the fact that the BLUR interface Motorola once employed in earlier smart phones is just about gone. The interface is pretty much stock Android, and unlike with earlier versions, it looks damn good and is easy to access.It took me a bit to get used to having virtual buttons at the bottom of the phone as opposed to physical buttons, and I'm still learning some of the ins and outs of this badboy, but all in all I am extremely satisfied with this phone. It might not be the Galaxy S3, which let's face it, as of this writing is the king of smartphones in terms of features. But what it is, is a rock-solid alternative for those whom want a great smartphone with tons of features on a budget.Update 10/13/12: I actually found out what a tough little phone this thing really is, during a rainy day, I was cooking burgers on the grill and went outside to go check on them, I ended up slipping and falling on the ramp we designed for my grandmother two times, the second time I hit my back pretty hard. I had my phone with me, and it fell out of my pocket. The thing was completely in tact, not a scratch, ding, dent or anything, and it still works as good as ever.Update 01/07/13: A few months ago, I had this phone updated to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, while it hiccups here and there, all in all it still holds up remarkably well. I recall it was at the 5 month cycle that I had started having problems with the HTC EVO 4G when I was with Sprint. So far, no problems here at all. It's still as tough as frigging nails, I had dropped it accidentally a second time, and still no damage to the phone at all. Battery still holds up very well too, still getting anywhere from 8 - 16 hours on a charge depending on the usage. I'm quite satisfied, hopefully this badboy will last me until September of 2014 when I am eligible for an upgrade.Update 03/28/13: Sadly my uncle could not afford the upkeep of the Verizon account even with my contribution, ergo I no longer have this phone. Needless to say I am back with Sprint thanks to this. However, with the trade-in credit from the RAZR M, I was able to get one of the best phones on the market which I will be reviewing.

It was really, and is, a big pain dealing with iTunes.In any event, after researching phones I landed on this phone because I liked its size, the specs, and price.  I use my phone primarily for phone calls, texting, emails.  So the camera and screen quality was less of an issue.

You also get more apps with the iPhone, but Google Play Store has improved so much recently all the major apps are now shared.  Now that the Razr M has been upgraded to v4.1 it's even better.  I can listen to text messages over Bluetooth while driving, and voice commands are excellent... much MUCH better than iPhone's Siri.  As far as the build, this thing is a tank.

The ICS is fun, the Processor is extremely fast, the camera is clear (albeit a slow shutter speed) and the build, fit and finish are amazing.

The \"edge-to-edge\" display is great, with a small bezel it really makes the phone feel much larger to your eyes, while staying small in your hands. I know the great moto build quality will last the 2 years I will be with this phone, as the strong aluminum bezel, tough Kevlar backing (yes, yes, I know its just martketing tactics, but it feels cool) gorilla glass, and weather-resistant coating all work hand in hand to provide a steady, strong and durable device.If you hate the massive size devices have grown to today (Ahem, GS3) and are looking the full package in a small box, this is the device for you.I will wait patiently for Jelly Bean, as this phone has been cleared for that as well (Can we do 6 stars when that comes out?)", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Only thing that could make it better will be the JB update!", "Author": "cubsfan", "ReviewID": "R3JPACG2QX0YLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for 3 days now and love it!  My previous phone was a Droid X, which was a great phone, but the new Razr M has the same screen size, way faster,  is smaller overall, and lighter.  I was looking at the other Razr phones and the Samsung S3, but they where all too big for my taste.  When I saw the M I knew this was what I was looking for.  Big screen in a small light package that fits in your pocket with ease.  For reference it is the same physical size as the new iPhone 5, but with a touch bigger screen and much smaller price tag.I think the screen is crisp, bright, and clear, despite what I have read in other reviews, and I don't see any pixelation.  Battery life has been amazing.  I'm currently at 47 hrs since recharge and still at 35%.  This is with heavy use still setting up apps, ringtones, etc, and about 1 hour of talk time.  I'm thinking 3 days will be possible once I get to more normal usage and less playing with my new gadget.Super fast.  Dual core 1.5GHz snapdragon CPU with 1 gig RAM means it will run apps with ease.  I am amazed at how quick it is compared to my old phone which wasn't exactly a slouch.If your used to ICS OS then this phone will feel very familiar to you.  Coming from GB OS on my X was a learning curve, but I'm really looking forward to the new Jelly Bean OS that is supposed to be available shortly.I had to give up my unlimited data plan (or pay full retail price to keep it), but I don't think this will be a problem.  I'm using less network data than my old phone thanks to the \"Smart Actions\" that can be set up.  It automatically switches to Wifi when GPS tells the phone that I am at home or office.  Nice!About the only negative that I think of is the location of the power button.  It's just above the volume up button and I have already hit it twice while trying to turn up the volume.  I'll get used to it in time.In short if your looking for a feather lite, powerful, and quick smartphone with a nice size display, but don't want a big bulky lump, then this is the phone for you.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just right", "Author": "kcabpilot", "ReviewID": "RDDR1G734NK1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a Droid X.

This is absolutely amazing for me as I never have to worry about my phone dying around 5PM like I did with other phones.The screen is sharp and big enough for whatever you need on a phone. The edge to edge design makes the overall size of the phone feel smaller and lightweight and fits great in my hand, even though the screen is large.And although I do not use it much, for what its worth, being able to talk and surf web, etc at the same time is amazing.

She loves it.  I have to admit, it looks pretty good.Hardware:Screen:I was worried about the screen based on the technology used, but it looks gorgeous.Radio:I've sat next to her in crap locations while my phone (S3) was on 1X and her phone was on 3G.NFC:NFC makes me happy.  Is great for transmitting small bits of data (phones back to back or NFC stickers) and setting up triggered tasks based on device placement (NFC Stickers).  Stick an NFC sticker to your GPS dock and have the phone automatically go into navigation mode.  To me, NFC alone makes this better than any phone without it.  iPhones, I'm looking at you.  Verizon's blocking of Google Wallet however, limits the full potential of NFC for now and makes me sad.Camera:The rear-facing camera isn't bad by any means, but it that impressive either if you've used recent phones.  I'm pretty sure it uses the same chipset I've seen in phones with better cameras though, so it might get better with an update.  The front-facing camera steps things down a notch to the .3 megapixels that I had hoped we'd all gotten past.  Don't expect to be taking great self portraits without a mirror.Battery:The 2000 mAh Li Ion is incredible.  It keeps this device powered long after most phones (that aren't the Razr Maxx) will die.  The Jelly Bean update does lower battery life a bit, probably because of Google Now more than anything, but it still has better battery life than almost any other device.Overall:The phone is a great compact size with a nice crisp 4.3\" display. You're not getting a \"retina\" display, but the only thing you'll probably ever feel like they skimped on is the front-facing camera.

But what they may not tell you in the store or is listed in the very non-specific small print is that about 3.5 GB of that 8GB is already used and cannot be reclaimed. From basic after-purchase research I guess it's from the OS, reserved space for future updates and 'bloatware'. (apps that come with the phone... and in the case of Android / Verizon, cannot be uninstalled). So after purchase you really get about 4 GB of storage for apps. Just be sure to get a microSD card and point your pictures / video to it and I think the average user will be fine with the remaining space. I tend to get app happy on my Android tablet. I'm just being a little more conscious of apps and space with my new phone.,I look at it like this, I can tolerate having what is actually a 4GB phone and I can tolerate the bloatware for a really nice phone that was basically free. The good news for us Android users is that we have the micro SD slot where you can store your pictures, movies and songs. And we don't have to deal with iTunes. (the main reason I did not choose an iPhone) So bottom line for me is that I'm okay with those compromises.I would recommend this phone.

The fact that Moto doesn't add much to it is a testament to Google's influence. And that is a good thing, in my book.The major plusses - call quality, talk and data signal strength, the speed with which you can move through screens and apps - it really is a good device.I am coming to this device from an HTC Thunderbolt and a Razr Maxx HD (that fell victim to a horrible accident). When they say that this phone is the most compact Android device with a 4.3-inch screen, that's not just PR hype. This is a very thin, light (though well-constructed), phone. Coming from the above devices, I found myself thinking the phone was TOO thin and TOO light. I have big hands and I kept feeling like the phone was going to shoot out of my hands, but after putting a case on it, I no longer have any problems.I only have three negatives (other than the above about the size and heft of the device - and I think that's personal preference). The first is the LED. I am used to it glowing when it's plugged in, and according to the manual, it's supposed to do so. Mine doesn't. In fact, the only time the LED flashes is when I get a text or email, and it wasn't even doing that at first. Aftermarket LED apps didn't do any good, either. I assume it's just my device being wonky, but I have read where others have had different issues.Second, and I think is an issue across the board with Jelly Bean, is the difficulty in making an MP3 your ringtone or notification sound. Used to be able to do this simply through your default media player. Now you have to download an app to make this happen (and there are apps that make this a very simple process). It just shouldn't be that hard. I think this should be a built-in function.Last - I'm having a hell of a time keeping the phone connected to my computer when I attempt to transfer media to the phone. Whenever I drag and drop files over, it's hit or miss as to whether they'll actually copy. Often I get an error saying something along the lines of \"the device has stopped working.\" This happens whether or not I'm attempting to transfer to the SD card or internal memory, whether or not I'm connected as an Media Device or \"camera,\" regarless of what iteration of USB port I'm connected to (1.0, 2.0 or 3.0), and on various versions of Windown (Vista, 7 and 8). I'm sure there's a simple something I'm not doing or some bug that needs to be found.

This phone completely lacks the ability to move applications from internal storage to the SD card.  Even third-party applications such as App2SD cannot do so, as they only streamline the native process.  That being said, the phone has ample internal memory, roughly 4.6GB, which is far more than I need for my applications at this time, and I imagine a long time to come.

That phone came with an earlier version of Android but I rooted it to get the later version & get rid of Verizon bloatware including Bing as the default search engine.There are so many cool things to like about this phone & Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean). It has a higher resolution screen than my old phone - 540x960 vs 480x800. Even with the higher res, the phone is smaller, about 1/8\" in each dimension. The thickness is the same, but tapers to a bit thinner than the Samsung. The RAZR M has the same resolution & screen size as some other current Moto phones, but with less bezel. I like having a smaller phone. I liked the RAZR MAXX for its battery life & 540x960 res, but it was just too big. The ratio of thickness to height & width made it seem too thin like I'd probably break the screen at a huge expense to replace. Insurance costs upfront or monthly  typically has a $100 deductible. Both the RAZR M & MAXX were the same price ($0), so that wasn't a consideration.The weak point of this phone is the camera. The Samsung was 5 megapixels & this one is 8, but the image is not as good as what I was used to. Shadow ares show lots of noise. It has problems doing macro shots where the Samsung focused closely.I considered the Samsung Galaxy S III, but like the RAZR MAXX, the size turned me off.There are some great features of Jelly Bean that really make using the phone better than Froyo. There's a recent apps button that brings up all of your recently opened apps. Chrome also has something similar to tabs on a desktop browser that lets you keep many web pages open & switch among them.The phone came with Ice Cream Sandwich & was updated to Jelly Bean a few days later. This update removed the ability to hook the phone up to a PC via USB (UMS) to add & remove files from the phone's memory. That was a stupid move on the part of Google. Furthermore Motorola tech support didn't even have that issue in their knowledge base & I wasted over 2 hours on the phone & resetting it to factory specs. I've found AirDroid to connect via Wifi & access the files on the phone, but it's not as seamless or fast as just using a USB cable. Shame on you Google.They also removed Speed Dialing. It was halfway there in Ice Cream Sandwich - you could set up speed dials, but they didn't work. So they removed the halfway implemented feature from Jelly Bean. Some Moto (Google now) rep online said they found that speed dials weren't used very much. We've has speed dials since cordless phones with touch tone buttons.

Individual results will vary, but so long as you don't have a million services running in the background, you should go a full day on a charge. Some friends of mine aren't so lucky with older RAZR models. They had to buy extended batteries, or keep a charger with them.Having mentioned batteries; you can't open this model. That is, the battery is sealed inside the phone. You do have easy access to the SIM and MicroSD card slots.The best feature in my opinion is the Motorola Smart Actions application (included on the phone). It's like a slimmed down version of the \"Tasker\" app. Smart Actions allow monitoring of simple conditions to manage battery life, messages, profiles, or locations. For example, IF I'm at home, and its after 10pm, and the phone hasn't been picked up in 10 minutes, THEN turn off the ringer, disable WiFi and Mobile Data, and auto reply to incoming text messages. It's really handy.The screen is AMOLED and quite beautiful. Since each pixel generates light individually, black is OFF and thus truly black. There is no back light.I've been using the phone for about four months and I've had no problems. The local Verizon 4G LTE network gives me a blazing 21 Mbps download (faster than my home internet!), and gets great signal.The only downside is the camera. It takes O.K. photos. The photos seem a little fuzzy (like someone painted them) under high zoom. The HDR mode does take nice photos in low light, and the macro capabilities are decent. The new panoramic feature in Android 4.1+ is less than great. Very rarely do the photos stitch together well, and usually the blurriness is horrible.Data access priority is a bit of a pet peeve. If WiFi and Mobile Data are both turned on, the phone will prioritize access via the WiFi. If you enter a building or area with free WiFi access, the phone will connect automatically. The issue I find annoying is often these free access networks require you to accept terms of service (TOS) via a redirected web page before the network grants you access to the internet. So you ARE connected to the WiFi hotspot, but not the internet. If for example you quickly try and comparison shop a product on Amazon, you get a network error (this happens a lot when you aren't aware there's free WiFi). You either have to load the browser and accept the WiFi hotspot TOS, or shut off WiFi. Kind of annoying- especially since most free hotspots don't remember you when you return a few days later and you need to repeat the process. Not really a problem with the phone specifically. In my opinion if the phone doesn't detect internet access on the WiFi connection, it should automatically switch to the Mobile Data connection. I shouldn't have to force it to switch. It's an unnecessary step. In fairness, this may be by design to assist users using too much data on their data plans.Also, if you're thinking of a case, I find this one to work well. It doesn't bulk out the phone, and includes a secure belt clip:Verizon OEM Shell Belt Clip Holster Combo Case and Kick Stand for VZW Motorola Droid Razr M XT907 RAZRM XT 907 by VerizonAnd if you're looking for a ridiculously overbuilt, industrial car window mount, try this:RAM Mount Universal X-Grip Holder Twist Lock Suction Cup MountIn all I am very happy with this phone.

I like this phone for many different reasons but mainly for size and unadulterated Android experience. Phone is easy to handle considering it has 4.3\" screen; feels light in shirt pocket. I upgraded to Jelly Bean and Motorola has not messed around with core Android too much. Compared to Samsung Galaxy 3, you would notice how beautiful the fonts, color schemes, menu layout and transitions look. Difference to a keen eye is huge. For example, the settings menu is easier to access than on S3 even though they both have Jelly Bean. Another plus is how few default apps have been thrown in by Verizon compared to TMobile. In fact, Motorola's Smart Actions saves you time and embarrassment. You can configure it to go silent at work, turn on GPS automatically when driving and have it announce caller's name when at home! Also, did you know that this phone has same processor as S3?!!All the apps start quickly, page movements are fluid and videos play loud and clear.Phone looks sexy from all angles. Call quality is acceptable, nothing wrong with it. Battery life is acceptable as well, I am a fairly heavy user of data services through the day and it lasts till night on single charge. Photo quality is 7 out of 10, I felt S3 reproduced slightly more accurate colors.

I wanted a Casio one that was waterproof but the salesman convinced me to get this, saying it was faster and not as buggy... Well...Pros:- Heavy, solid build- DROID- MicroSD portCons:- Software (as of 1/12/2014, ALL M's are stuck on Android 4.1.2 with no word on updates)- Speaker goes out very quickly- Super slow- Not enough RAMLet me start with the cons of this phone. First, the software. As Google announces 4.4 KitKat, Motorola users have been stuck on 4.1.2 or thereabouts for well over a year. The OS is old, buggy, and apps are starting to have issues. You can try to get 4.4 unofficially by \"rooting\" your phone, which, as of the most recent updates, is impossible. So if you're looking into getting into custom ROMs and hacking your phone, this isn't the one for you.The speakers. After about 2 months of having the phone (and not rooting it), I would answer a call and nothing. Just silence. I would hang up and dial the number again and I wouldn't even hear the dial tones you get when the other person's phone is ringing. I'd check my phone and yep, it's connected to the other person. I would get a text back that they could hear me. I've reset my phone countless times in an attempt to solve the issue. After some quick research, Verizon refuses to acknowledge the issue and blames Motorola, and vice versa. Shortly after that went, my speaker on the back went, meaning if I got a call and my phone wasn't on vibrate, I'd miss it.Speed. It's very very laggy once you actually get your phone up and running. Even texting can be a challenge on this phone. It'll freeze when switching conversations and even opening the basic included app. I've tried others and the included app is /the/ fastest, least glitchy one. You can't play any games that require any amount of graphics other than solitaire. Videos and movies are ok though.The pros! It is solidly built. After the speaker had already broken, I accidentally dropped my phone from about chest high and it was fine (with an OtterBox). The screen didn't crack and the buttons still work.DROID. Who doesn't like that DRRROOOOOIIID sound?MicroSD. I've been looking at other phones and some of them do NOT have a MicroSD slot. For example, the new Moto X comes in only 8 and 16 gig versions (actual usable space is less) and there's no slot for a MicroSD. So if you want to listen to music without streaming over the network and running your battery down and data rates up, you can only keep some songs, maybe a movie.So, to wrap things up, the phone has points for the MicroSD slot, DROID sound, and build quality minus the speakers. It looses points for software OS not being upgraded, speakers have short life expectancies, it's very slow, and not enough RAM.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lousy Reception", "Author": "Kaity", "ReviewID": "R25S71RIOF4C9A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you live in the city then the phone is probably fine.

At first I thought the phone seemed kind of flimsy compared to the X2, which was a tank. But now that I've had a chance to break this in, I must say it is a lot tougher than it looks thanks to the gorilla glass and Kevlar case.I use this in a lot of areas that are out in the sticks, and except when I am in the deepest, darkest jungles of South Carolina, I always have enough signal to get out a call or stream in some Pandora. The sound on this phone is head and shoulders better than the X2. It still suffers a touch from Motorola's penchant to overemphasize the high end. But at least it doesn't sound shrill  and tinny like the X2 did. It is quite listenable even with flat equalization. A little tweaking can make it sound great on a good sound system. I'd suggest springing for a 32G micro SD card, you'll likely be loading up your library to this thing very quickly. When I did mine, I found that the micro USB connection was pretty fast with my Class 10 card, which was a pleasant surprise. I filled the card up in no time.A highlight is the fine display on this phone. It's not quite full HD, but streaming Netflix programs I couldn't really notice the difference.  One caveat I found about this phone is the lack of an HDMI port. But then in the years I had the X2 I think maybe I used it twice, so I can't even justify taking a half star off for that. Colors are very vibrant under normal lighting conditions. It is tough to see the display in very strong sunlight, though. Not really irritating enough to dock a star, but it can be troublesome if you are trying to navigate somewhere with the GPS. And so far the GPS has been flawless. I can't say the same about previous Motorola products I've owned, where the chip had a nasty tendency to cook itself to death.The main camera on the phone is pretty decent and will do a fine job for day to day picture taking. If you are some kind of artiste, you might find some minor faults in the color representation, but I hardly think the average joe like me is going to notice anyway. Haven't played with the front facing camera yet, so can't comment there.The phone did not come with Android 4.1 (it came with 4.0) but as soon as I activated it, 4.1 was immediately downloaded without a hitch. I was pleasantly surprised that a lot of older apps still run without a hitch, although one of my favorites was squashed by Google, not Android itself.  Another issue, but not worth docking the phone, is the huge assortment of Bloatware Motorola and Google insist on sticking in this thing. I wouldn't mind so much, except that you can't uninstall this crap without rooting the phone. Totally uncalled for. So other than minor quibbles, I have to say that I have been pleased with the performance of the phone itself.

Motorola, in its infinite wisdom, to prevent rooters from rooting the Razr M, eliminated the option to move apps to micro SD card.  4 gigs is not enough space for apps if you like a tons of apps and you like trying new ones without having to worry about deleting others to make room.Basically, you HAVE to buy a micro SD card for this phone. Period.  I have a 32GB card in the phone and I should be able to get my photos, music, and videos on the card and use the internal space solely for apps.  I stream most of my big files from 3 cloud services but I like the convenience of having my files on my devices if possible.If I had paid $100 for this phone, instead of $0, I would be even more annoyed by the storage issues.

My boyfriend has had the Droid Razr for about 7 months and I have been extremely jealous of all of his internet browsing capabilities for a long time. I was stuck with a Samsung Exhibit 4G for a while from a useless wireless provider in Cincinnati, Ohio called Cincinnati Bell. The provider sent me a text message to inform me that 80% of my data usage has to be done in Cincinnati or Dayton areas. Well, that's kind of hard for me being a college student living 3 hours away from home. So, I dropped their \"service\" and switched to Verizon.Best decision ever made. Verizon is a wonderful provider, as many know already. But this review is about the Droid Razr M, which I will try to stay focused on.I have had quite a bit of experience with the Droid Razr, because it is the phone my boyfriend has, and now that I have the Razr M, we can both see some very clear improvements:* Edge- to-Edge screen* Less wide, more hand/pocket friendly size* Lightening fast Jelly Bean operating system* Only $50 with a new two-year plan with Verizon* Long battery lifeI can run on a single charge all day. I would say that I am on my phone more often than my boyfriend is on his phone and yet here it is at 10:20pm and my phone has 40% battery life while his Droid Razr is nearly dead. (Both woke up around 9am)I like that the main three icons (back, home, recent apps) are now a part of the main ever-changing touch screen. There is now no menu icon, but sometimes you will see a ... icon to the right of the recent app icon, which comes and goes as needed. Sometimes the \"back\" icon changes to a down-arrow when the keyboard is up to allow you to hide the keyboard.I like the \"circles\" widget that comes with the operating system, which allows you to see the Current date, time, set your alarm, view the weather, and view your battery.There is a Quick Settings option when you are on the homescreen and you swipe your finger from left to right. This screen is so useful because now I can access commonly sought after items in the settings like ringtone on/off, Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS, Mobile Data, and airplane mode. It it is a screen that is very like a swtichboard which allows you to turn these things off and on as needed.Anyways, all in all, there are lots of things to love about this fine phone and its fine operating system. I love it and if you are on your phone often, this one is great for you because it has 1GB RAM and can pretty much take any amount of app usage you want to throw at it without crashing. \\", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Wyatt Earp \"besticles\"", "ReviewID": "RS073WVUBSHRD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The good:- upgrades to Jellybean- fast.

Much faster than my old phone, and the battery seems to last far longer too (not that I had much trouble with my old Droid.) I've replaced the stock launcher with Launcher Pro, which I had been using on my old phone. The Plus upgrade transferred over easily also. Since I replaced the stock launcher, the interface is almost identical to what I am used to. The main differences are listed below:The power button was moved from the top right to the right top. Not a big difference, but I've already found that some of my habits don't work anymore, like picking it up in such a way as to turn it on simultaneously. It's also a little harder to find with my finger, but I'm still sure I'll get used to it.The charging port was moved from the left top to the left bottom, and rotated backward. When I'm in my car, I plug in the phone and place it vertically in the cup holder where I can see it without moving much more than my eyes. Fortunately I have a cut-out on the side of the cupholder in my car. If I didn't this would definitely cause a problem. If you have a similar habit, check whether this will still work for you. The port is only about an inch from the bottom of the phone.The menu button doesn't always display. This is actually a good thing, because some apps don't use that button, and this way you can tell if there's actually a menu.The search button has been replaced with a recently used apps button. I'm not seeing this being more useful, but truthfully, I don't think I used the search button very often, and there is now a Google Search widget. Not necessary on the old phone because of the button, but I guess they decided that this would be better.The ring tones aren't very good. Of course, this is just my opinion, but none really sound to me like \"my\" phone. Or even \"a phone\" for that matter. I guess I'll go find an app for that later, but in the mean time I'm using my old ringtone. The notifications are better, but I haven't found a way to set one for gmail separately; it just uses the default.Settings are easier to navigate. Or at least prettier, with a smaller font so more fit on the screen. Anyway, I think this is better.I like the Smart Actions app. I do like that it lets me change settings on things like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, mobile data, screen brightness, volume, etc based on a trigger like connecting to my home Wi-Fi network, being (or not being) plugged in, time of day, battery level, and/or not moving for a while. Still working on making it work right for me. My biggest complaint so far is that there seems to be no way to detect \"in the car\" besides connecting to your car's bluetooth (which I don't have.) My wish is that it could check speed, or disconnecting from Wi-Fi. Speaking of which, for some reason it wasn't able to use my location because it couldn't determine an address... even though it could place me correctly on the map. Not sure why it needs an address to tell if I'm within a certain distance of a given location. So, Smart Actions has its pros and cons. If you don't like it, don't use it. If you do, you can make basic actions like turning the volume and brightness down at night, and then back up in the morning. You can also make more complex ones using numerous triggers (e.g. being plugged in and connected to wi-fi and in a certain location.)Having ordered mine from Amazon, it came with several Amazon apps preinstalled, and a few other shopping apps that I'm not familiar with (my wife said one sold shoes... whatever.) Take this as you will. For a $99 price difference between Amazon and Verizon, I'll accept a few extra unremovable apps for the next 2 years.Edit: I've now had this phone for about a month and a half. As expected, some of the changes I've learned to deal with, like the power button placement, however I still prefer the top placement, as the volume buttons are harder to find accurately this way. As for the charging port, the change of orientation no longer bothers me as much, but I still wish it had a light to indicate that it was actually charging.I really like the recently-used Apps button now. It helps the phone act as a multitasking system. Think of it like a version of the task bar on a Windows computer, that shows all your running apps... only it's not just the ones currently running; it also shows the ones you've recently started and exited (so if you really like a certain app, you can quit and instead of finding it on a desktop, you can quickly find it there.)I've also gotten to love the Google Now features. These include cards that tell such things as how long it will take you to get home or to work, what the weather forecast is, the details of your upcoming flights, and what events are coming up in your area. There is also a search bar in the cards view, so it's a quick and easy way to do a google search. I've turned on a setting so that I just have to drag the home icon up to activate it, so I no longer miss the search button being always on the screen. This is just as convenient.Still loving Smart Actions. Still frustrated that there's no good way for it to tell that I'm in the car.The phone is still fast and smooth. Unfortunately the 8 GB preinstalled only has 4 GB usable for apps, and you can't install apps to the SD card. I'm at about 1 GB of the 4 GB app limit. I can't yet predict whether I'll hit the limit before I'm done with the phone. I'm irritated that the limit is so low because I like my technology to be future-resistant. It's definitely enough for now, but over time, requirements tend to grow and I expect that for many, possibly including myself, they will outgrow the capabilities of this phone.

But then I saw the Razr M while browsing the store, and I had to try it out.  I was amazed at how fast the phone was, considering its size.  I had the Razr at the time, and the Razr M made it look horribly slow.  As I continued to play around with the phone, I loved how easy it was to customize, from adding extra \"home page\" slides, to favorite apps, this phone was phenomenal.Now that I have had the phone for a while, I have found I like it even more.  Not only does it have every feature from the Razr, including a good quality camera (for a cell phone at least), it had made improvements on many of the features, including the phone being lighter, smaller and yet still having a very large screen.

It opens up applications quickly, and switches apps and screens with almost zero delay. When I receive a notification that I have a new email, I can be at that open gmail message in literally 2 or 3 seconds.The screen on this phone is extremely good as well. I've seen lots of reviews criticizing the pentile display as not being \"true HD\", but I'm quite sure most people wouldn't know that if someone hadn't told them, it just plain looks extremely high definition to me.The battery life is also more than adequate. I was afraid going from a feature phone that I had to recharge maybe twice a week to a smart phone, that I'd be sadly disappointed in the battery life. But I can go two full days on a charge with the Razr- that's looking at maybe 20-30 emails a day, another 30-40 texts, 20 minutes of conversations, a few photos and maybe 15 minutes of web browsing.My 15 year old son has the iphone 4s, and he considers the build quality of the Razr M to be at least as good as his phone, likes the screen size better, and really can't tell much of a difference in screen quality between the two.The camera is another area where professional reviewers have beaten on this phone a bit. I've taken a number of photos with it already, and anything taken in strong to medium light looks absolutely fine. Its low light capabilities are a bit weaker than the iphone 4s but again, coming from a feature phone with a 2.3 MP camera that could barely produce a recognizable image in low light, the Razr M camera is very adequate.All in all, I'm very happy with the Razr M, and I'd give it 5 stars if not for the bloatware issue that Verizon has caused by insisting on putting all kinds of Amazon and other partner apps in a phone that only has 8 gigs of storage internally.I looked at several alternatives before deciding on the M. The Galaxy SIII was just a bit awkward in size, felt a bit cheaper in quality, and the screen wasn't quite as bright. The iphone 5 was an another option, but I really hated the thought of being dependent on itunes, and it didn't even give you the option of increasing its storage with a micro usb card.

Do they test at all?", "Author": "ThomasH", "ReviewID": "RD4NSLCIPWRLW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This negative critique may, or may not relate to the Razr Phone itself (Motolora), or it might be rather directed toward the Droid Operating System (Google).  Some aspects might even address rather Droid App's.  Foremost, we direct here a lot of critique toward the miserable Phone App, which is provided with the Razr by Verizon.For an end user it is difficult to make a clear distinction, who is to blame, and how to achieve an improvement.We found that it is difficult to use Razr as a phone, to simply make phone calls. That droid app is marred by bugs and bizarre malfunctions, details below.Surely, the New Technology changes our lives in a positive manner.  This device indeed gives a combined phone, email and web access.  The implementation is very immature, or outright experimental.  I do not have any measure to compare a Droid based solution to an iPhone.Let me enumerate what's bad, or unsatisfactory from a standpoint of this user:1) Very bad screen for outdoors, barely visible even in brightest setting.  I have to cover the screen with a hand, or turn to cast shadow on the phone in order to see anything. Indoors the colors are vibrant, and one can indeed enjoy web and photography.2) Miserable phone operations, demanding numerous taps to finally get someone called.  I counted as many as 10-11 taps in some of the cases, till I finally heard dialing tone. This is the MAJOR POINT OF OUR CRITIQUE.Just think about it: In a phone with hard buttons the \"Dial\" and \"Hangup\" operations are predictable and located on the very same place.  Here the location, and even the looks of the \"Dial\" tap-area vary in almost every situations!  Its horrible, counter intuitive.  We really need an equally looking, placed on an identical location \"Call\" or \"Dial\" button, and the same should be for the \"Hangup\" button.3) Unreliable hangup, major security risk:The foldable devices were extremely easy to reliably end a call: Flip it close, the call ends.  Here I encountered numerous cases when the person I called did not realized that the call was still \"on,\" with the device already in the pocket or in the purse!  Horrible, and a major, major privacy + security risk.4) Unwanted hangup:The opposite of the previous issue: Sometimes during making phone calls an accidental tap on the screen, even by the edge of the ear(!!), may disconnect. I lost numerous calls by some strange unwanted operation.  The \"hangup\" area is currently a large read area spreading all across the screen. Easy to be touched by mistake.5) Blanking out screen, impossible to resume operations.Atop of the barrage of complaints thus far, this seem to be an outright stunning bug, do they test at all??  The screen darkens in order to save energy, fine.  But than shaking phone, tapping on the screen etc, does not revive the screen at all.  For example, someone is on a loudspeaker, and you would like to switch this off.  No way, no how, once the screen is dark.  Disconnect and call again.  Or imagine, you listen to a voice mails.  Screen goes dark, automated system says something \"Press 7 to delete, press 9 to save.\"  But you have no chance to enter anything, the dial pad is gone, and it cannot be reactivated.  That is an \"F\" to the designers.  Ridiculous.  The Google folks are very arrogant, they think that they have the wisest and the brightest.  In reality, the software is very immature.6) Hung-up and loudspeaker buttons close to each other, on the same side of the device.  I constantly depress the 'loudness down/up' instead of hung up.  And than I end up with a silent phone without noticing it, or vice versa.7) Erratic operations with some Apps. For example one day for no apparent reason I lost the Navigator App, which was placed on my front page.  To my astonishment that App has also vanished from the pages of pre-installed Apps!  Later we found out after a call to support, that this App was integrated by Google into the newer Maps.  Google should have provided an empty app with a re-director.8) Some apps seem to run in the background and discharge the battery at a high rate.  It is so difficult to discover this on time.  We lost the battery charge completely on more than one occasion.9) Timer alarms may be difficult to stop.  In some cases the alarm buttons disappear from the surface, and than it is a drama to stop the \"ding-dong\", which may appear in a bad moment.  It happened to me that after 3-4 minutes of futile attempts to stop the alarm, I walked out of the meeting, and tried for a few more minutes to silence the alarm, till I finally simply hard powered-down the phone in order to silence it.  Same happened to my wife.  One feels like an idiot with this device.  Later I discovered, that one can \"slide down\" the entire droid desktop, to unveil a sort of an \"activity log\" screen.  On this screen is the timer entry as well, which can be silenced from there.Here I am also looking back with nostalgia at my \"old plain cell phone,\" in which I could simply press any button, even blindly in the pocket, to silence the audible alarm. That was a great ergonomic.  This here is just a total nonsense.  Who is making these decisions?  Who is testing?10) The Chrome browser has also some quirky sides.  For example I was puzzled why the scroll up/down cased sometimes rather a zoom in/out.  I finally recently discovered what happens: When one of the fingers is too close the edge, Droid \"thinks\" that the scroll operation is actually the \"pincer move\" zoom operation.  Keeps the other fingers well away in order to reliably scroll up/down.11) When I lie down the phone on the table, it tends to think that I turn it horizontally, and it constantly rotates the display from portrait into landscape.12) Last but not least:  Support does not exist virtually.  To this day neither Motorola nor Verizon helped me with the many issues, nor has someone fixed some of the issues listed here.Its not really a \"last\" in the list, I am just tired of collecting the items, and you would be tired of reading it.  This list could easily be doubled in size.Did I mentioned: Many people said they miss their old phone? I also do miss my Old Beat-up Phone (OBP).  Despite the fact that I can now browse web, and see my email on the run, the price paid for the convenience is high.  I wish I could return this device, but its not possible.

I had no expectations since this would be my first smartphone. I was looking for a compact phone that could fit into my pocket. I was also looking for a device that could be my camera, music player, and be able to run the games I want to play.This phone is similar in size with the iPhone 5 and it currently runs with 4.1.2 Jellybean (the current version of software, 4.4 Kitkat is supposedly being released in a \"few weeks\").Pros:-Colorful display, very bright when turned on the highest setting-8 MP Camera on the back, which is a good camera for normal lighting, but it doesn't do well in low lighting.-Runs Android 4.1.2 and may receive an update to 4.4 Kitkat in the future-NFC functional (phone transfers/receives data by touching with another phone; Used it to check the balance on my bus card)-loud alarm clock-People ask if it's an iPhone so... Thank you Apple for setting the standard.-Chromecast Remote, but that seems more Chromecast than this phone...-Durable with case: case has dings and no broken screenOkay, but could be better:-Games: it works, but once in a while (if you're playing Riptide GT 2) it may just not respond, so just press \"Okay\" and keep playing.-Rear Speaker can be accidentally muffled by my fingers, but it is loud.-4G LTE may not be found in certain areas, but normally high school tries to lessen your signal and mountain overpasses probably are meant to be remote for a reason.-Call quality could be better on speaker phoneCons:-Lag. Not many people want to perform factory resets, although it's easier if your life does not revolve around your phone. Lag can also be remedied by changing the animation, window, and transition scale to none (although to the psychologically, none may seem like the phone is lagging even more) or  to  0.5 under developer options in the Settings. Do not get a task killer app; it just closes processes that the phone will reopen and it's a vicious cycle.-Battery: It's decent, can keep maybe a day and some if you're a light user, but for heavier users with consistent screen on time, then it could last from 4-6 hours depending on if you have Wi-Fi or LTE on. Battery does get really warm with constant usage.- Pre-installed apps: If you don't use them, disable them or \"Force Stop\". I did this with the NFL, IMDB, Google Magazine, and Slacker radio. While it sucks to have apps that are some users don't need, the only way to remove the apps that I know of is to root the phone.Overall this phone is decent for a starter. It does the tasks that you want it to do and even becomes an integral part of your life if you choose. If Motorola holds up on its promise to bring 4.4 Kitkat to the phone, it may possibly change the lag situation. If you choose to buy this phone, then buy a case (even if it is thin rubbery plastic) to avoid dings if you drop it on concrete.

Unfortunately, soon after the warranty expired, the phone became sluggish and my apps began to crash. To try and fix this, I rebooted the phone, but it never was able to come all the way back on - it couldn't get past the start-up screen. I tried a factory restore with no luck. When I took it to Verizon, they tried everything they could, including reloading the entire operating system, but nothing worked. Apparently, the RAM in the phone went bad, due to no fault of myself, and now I'm stuck with a bricked phone. To make matters worse, I never realized that the phone stores all photos internally instead of on the SD card, so I lost everything.I realize it may have just been bad luck that I got a defective phone, but now I have 10 more months until I can get a new one.

This is not just one router, this is any time I've ever used the wi-fi. Even at home it has a terrible time holding onto the wi-fi signal despite the laptop and other phones in the house have no problem at all.

I had an LG Lucid before this phone...six of them!!! That phone was terrible and showcased the worst of android software and hardware. I had software issues, charger port issues, wrong number issues, and screen problems that took their own toll. Bottom line: that was my first LG product and my last one PERIOD.I'm sorry for that rant. That was just a horrible experience. Onto this phone.At first, I thought I was going to get the Galaxy Nexus, but they upgraded me to this phone because they were out of stock on the Nexus. This phone feels really nice in my hand. While I'd want something high-end like a Note II, this phone made me realize how smaller devices are still very necessary for many users. Not only that, but this phone feels tough. I mean REALLY tough. I dropped this thing, caseless in a restroom and it didn't even get a dent or chip.  The screen, is really strong as well. I guess Gorilla Glass 2 makes a huge difference. The colors are nice and vibrant, though unrealistically a bit over saturated, but doesn't look bad by any means. The resolution may not be as high as people hope for, but this is the highest I had on a phone so far. Just remember, this is a budget phone.In terms of hardware, like I said this thing is solid. With this thing being water resistant (not waterproof), made out of aircraft Aluminum and Kevlar backing, and Gorilla Glass 2, you get incredible value for what you pay for. The camera is also nice. Nothing to write home about though. It can be hard to focus and the lighting Is a little hard. I don't know, maybe I need to play with the settings more, and perhaps even experiment with camera apps on Google Play. At least it takes pics pretty fast.For the internal hardware, you get a gig of ram, with the same 1.5 dual-core processor found on the Galaxy SIII. Pretty darn good for a midrange phone if you ask me. One thing that people may not be too thrilled about (and believe me, I'm not either) is that while you get 8GB of storage, you only have 3.5 to 4GB to the user. I sort of half expected this, considering this is a budget phone. However, I have a bunch of apps installed and still have 1.5 free so I can't complain too much. I'm not blaming the OS for the amount of storage it takes, but rather the amount of bloatware apps Verizon insists on having and cannot even remove. They really can't even take a hint that we don't want a lot of these apps. I don't mind the Amazon apps because I love Amazon, I like Kindle, and who wouldn't want a free app a day on their Appstore. I really could care less about the Audible app (but I might get into it someday), but what I don't want is the NFL, Zappos, and the annoying VZ Navigator, all of which you can't even uninstall. You can just disable them so they don't show, but then it just becomes dead space. Like it was to begin with. I do like the office suite you get on it though. You can install a 32 GB micro SD card for your music, pictures, videos, and whatever else you need on there, though I have heard of people going up to 64 GB, depending on the class. I have a 16 GB installed, but will probably get a 32 or 64. If my Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet says it can go up to 32, but it can actually accept 64, then I might look into it for this phone. Also, the battery life is fantastic. I'm a fairly heavy phone user with apps like youtube and Google Chrome, but it has gotten me through the morning to late evening, and even to the nexy day.Performance wise, this phone runs like a dream. I'm not a hard core gamer on my phone, but I've seen Dead Trigger running great on a YouTube review. I play a few games like Words With Friends,  the Tetris games from EA, maybe some other casual and retro platformers, and emulators. They all work very well on this phone.Software wise, it is running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean with MotoBlur on top. You'd think that Motorola's skin would be intrusive, but it really isn't all that bad. In fact, of all the custom skins put out by Samsung and HTC, this actually looks really close to stock, and to a lot of users, that is welcoming. I guess since Google acquired Motorola, they only let their costum UI only enhance stock Android. I like the Smartactions, but in all honesty, this is all stuff that you can do manually. Moreover, Google Now is on here, which is like iOS's Suri, but in a class of its own. I don't think you'll be to disappointed in the accuracy of the voice recognition. After all, this company has been building on this foundation for years since before Suri was even born. I do like the circles widget. It's very handy, but I wish it was more transparent so it doesn't block so much of my wallpaper.Call quality is good on this phone.  The people I talked to sounded clear, but they said I sounded a bit fuzzy. The speaker is pretty good too, even for music and videos. When I connect my Skullcanfd headphones and earbuds, the sound was terrific.Here are some apps that I recommend for this phone specifically:Light Flow - good for customizing this phone' s notification LED for specific apps like Facebook as this phone has multiple color lights supported, but can't be found in the phone settings. There's a lite and paid version.Notification Light Widget - if your notification LED isn't on by default, you will need this. And it is actually made by Motorola. Rather than pushing an update to edit notification lights in the phone settings, they just made this widget instead.Notification Toggles - one thing I missed from the Lucid is that I could pull down the notification bar and have quick settings to tap like screen brightness and data on/off. This phone has no such fair, but with this, you can and then some.Conclusion:Overall, despite some flaws, this is a great phone for the price. The hardware and software is really good for the price and the screen is just the right size. If you get a Verizon salesman pushing another phone like either of the LG Lucids or Samsung Stratospheres, reject them and get this phone. This phone has had a lot of thought, care, and quality put into it, unlike those others I've mentioned. I will update on the camera once I play with it more along with other areas of the phone.Update: so far, I'm still rocking this phone very well and it hasn't had any scratches or dents at all. I'm still taking experimenting with the camera as I haven't had much of a chance to do so, but the pictures are good for the most part. Performance is still excellent overall.

The Motorola M ended up having some annoying problems of its own, so I wouldn't call it an improvement.  First off, I am always over-scheduled and have to rely on alarms to tell me where to be at what time.  Much of my day consists of administering medications to sick and injured animals on time.  I was hoping the alarm that comes with the Motorola M would fill that need.  Instead I had problems with the alarm either not going off at all, or going off and not being able to turn it off without powering down.  These issues always seemed to happen after I charged the phone, so I got into the habit of powering it down and up again when charging to avoid the alarm bugs.  What gets me is that I told the Verizon salesman that the alarm was the most important part of the phone for me, so it had to be reliable.  Apparently, he wasn't aware of this common problem with Motorola Ms.Next the flashing green notification light started going haywire.  Despite me checking my messages, I couldn't turn it off without powering down and powering up again.  Nothing more annoying than having a flashing light in your face telling you there are messages when there are not.  At this point nothing fixes it.  The light just flashes all the time, which makes me ignore it and makes me miss incoming texts and phone calls.Also, despite buying the anti-glare screen covers, I cannot see the screen at all if I am in direct or indirect sunlight.  When I get a call, I have to run indoors to unlock the phone and answer the call.  By then it has gone to voice mail.  I can take the lock off, but then I'll be back to the butt dialing problem.  What I'd like is a phone that can be answered by pushing hard buttons on the side in a specific order, not just one button that can be easily pushed by the pressure of rubbing up against something in a purse or by the pressure of bending over when it is attached to my belt, and a phone that doesn't require you to be able to see the screen to connect with an incoming call.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone for me", "Author": "Eau fresh", "ReviewID": "R752KKHSLO9Q7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really didn't want to do the smart phone, but I have to say it has changed me to have it, and I love this phone.

Most of the other reviews on here are pretty consistent about the phones pluses and minuses.

And I do miss a keyboard, since this is the first time I am forced to use the onscreen keyboard which takes getting used to,  but that is  not the phone's fault.  A source of many complains is the camera, it is fine for my use.  A little slow with t he shutter but very adequate.  The screen is nice, if not the most cutting edge, it is a phone after all not a wide screen TV.  As to the battery, I have found that the battery life is excellent.  I am not a power user, but especially by using the built in smart actions app allows you to turn on and off battery using features depending on your location (for instance, when you come home turn on the wifi and turn off data, etc.)  On standby the battery lasts an extremely long time, very satisfied.  When on the 4G it is amazingly fast, and with Verizon there are is good 4G coverage.  Even on 3G the speed is good.  A few issues, as someone mentioned the on/off and the volume controls are too close together (especially since these are the only two exterior switches).  I also get annoyed by the Motorola keyboard, it has no \"hide keyboard\" button, you have to hit the standard back button (not a huge deal) but worse is that the home button is right below the space bar so when texting I ham constantly mistakenly exiting my text by hitting the home button.  Not sure if all android ics keyboards are like this and I am probably more to blame than the keyboard but I am looking for an alternative keyboard to see if it works.

I had a Droid X for 2/3 years or something like that. This phone feels like a downgrade in many aspects.The camera is absolute garbage, especially compared to my old phone. There isn't even a macro setting (for small things, like, for example, if you wanted to take a picture of a bug). Maybe it's not a fair comparison, because I'm pretty sure the X had a better camera than a point'n'shoot camera I have.I cannot stand the location of the screen on button. It's right above the volume rocker, and when watching videos or something, I'll go to turn the volume up and turn the screen off and then have to find my place in the video again. The other thing about buttons that really irritates me is that there is NO WAY to connect the notification and ringer volume. You can't just turn the rocker up or down to change both. It only changes the ringer. This irritates the hell out of me. I've tried downloading like every volume app out there to try to fix it in the background, but you can only use them when they're open... so it's at least somewhat of a fix... but it's something that I shouldn't have had to fix.I also miss all of the real-people buttons on the screen. I really like having real buttons for things. Like, I would have preferred to have a real keyboard on a phone, rather than the touch screen one, but not even my old phone had that. The reason being is that my fingers get very cold very frequently and sometimes have a hard time being picked up on any touch screen. I dislike that these buttons will also go away in certain apps, or the lights will dim so you can't see what the button does. It is nice; however, to have the buttons rotate around when you turn the phone. I've had some minor problems trying to open up apps and the phone thinks I've slid my finger to move the screen. This may be because of touch screens not liking me, but my X never did that of which I can think.I've also been having a difficult time with anything with music or sound. For some weird reason, my music skips when I play it in the car. My X never did that once. I also use lightning bug at night for white noise and I've noticed that skipping often. I can't understand why it would skip... it isn't a cd or a tape and in the car, I can't use a tape adapter (anymore) and it has to play through the radio. This is also not a fault of the radio thing, because, again, it has never happened with my X.The nice thing is being able to disable bloatware apps. It still may be on the phone, but you can disable it and it won't bother you anymore. That is a really nice feature that I wish my X had.Getting the SD card out is a pain, but it is a lot easier to do than with the Droid X.

Verizon support will give you the wrong instructions and when you call back they suggest finding an app to move apps in Google play, but they won't recommend any specific app.  And none of the apps (free or paid) will actually move apps to the SD card.  Motorola support blames Verizon.  And forget about using a secure e-mail client, the security certificate can not be placed on the SD card either.  Maybe if this phone was rooted, it would be ok.

I programmed my phone to put all new music on the SD card but it wouldn't do that for some reason so I stopped buying songs on my phone all together. I brought it into the Verizon store and the guy looked at me and said \"You probably have too many apps\", and walked away. Not only was that not true but extremely rude.  I am now down to using only the apps i use every day and the annoying apps that came with the phone pre-installed that I do not use at all. From my research I gather that this is the first Droid phone that prevents app copying to SD card and will now do plenty of research before buying a new phone. Overall this phone is really great for a first time smart phone owner like myself but not for someone who uses a lot of storage space.

Now really worried I took it over and had Ghost armor installed on the screen. All my touch screen products have it. So I thought I could stop it from going any further. With in mins of the armor being installed a crack across the screen had developed. Now I started looking into the problems with the screen and found its a common area to break on this phone.

I have since learned that many PenTile displays look great, but unfortunately this one does not. The resolution on this phone is too low for PenTile and makes everything grainy, pixelated, etc. Colors are oversaturated, small text is hard to read. The biggest problem is white areas, which appear gray/orange, or like colored dots. Most web pages have a white background, so it's a constant annoyance. It gets worse if you turn down the brightness. Some people may not mind, but it was a deal-breaker for me. I returned the phone to Amazon.Many of the older displays suffered these problems, but as resolutions have improved, the issues have mostly gone away. Aside from the display, the RAZR M is a nice phone. The interface is intuitive and fast, the build quality seems solid. The speaker gets really loud. The phone's very thin, almost too thin for me. I'd prefer a little more to hold on to, but it seems comfortable enough. Although Amazon says it runs Ice Cream Sandwich, it's actually been updated to Jelly Bean. Non-removable battery and limited 8GB storage for applications might be an issue for some, but not a big deal to me.Sadly I just couldn't live with that display, it ruined the experience for me.
