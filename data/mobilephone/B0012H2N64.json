The display is very bright and colorful. The 2Gb of memory is good enough if you enjoy music and the 2mega pixel camera  is ok. I would give 5 stars to this phone if wasn't because of one major problem: It's incredible slow. It takes so much time to execute many single tasks like searching your phone list for example. Even navigate the menu can be painful cause sometimes it takes a while to change from one option to another (I usually click lots of time and it suddenly goes beyond the point I wanted.) Seriously, if you don't have patience don't buy this phone. I have, many times, wanted to just throw this phone at the wall.

They're not as intuitive as the others. However, they're not slow, and I've not run into any bug yet.- The camera is mediocre, but this isn't a cameraphone.

Unfortunately, this phone is excellent in the short-term and rubbish for the long-haul, so I am amending my review.  It stopped ringing after 8 months and it is perplexing as it makes other sound effects to notify you of voicemail and text messages.  It locks up for no reason too; basically, just a thorn in my side until it was replaced.  I am not sure what went wrong, but Motorola needs to take this back to the lab.

Out of the box there is a noticible lag when entering any input. After reading reviews and web searches, I flashed my phone with improved firmware from the dev community. This worked fine for awhile, but eventually the lag slowly and steadily increased.Just to be clear, all other considerations normally reviewed: the phone reception, features like music player & camera, etc. - all these things are absolutely irrelevant when pressing any button (including answering a call) takes 10 or more seconds to register. The phone in effect becomes worthless. In my opinion, this is almost worse than a bricked phone. If it were truly dead you would get a new phone & move on. This issue is intermittent in varying degrees and is a never ending source of frustration.I do not have any music or files stored, I do not have any memory card in the phone, only normal contacts are stored on the phone's internal memory.If you are looking for a phone replacement, do yourself a favor and keep looking.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Slow", "Author": "Jason Berry \"Possum\"", "ReviewID": "R3GJGAE00RRSAB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My only complaint is that it has speed issues.

I have to carry it in my pocket if I'm expecting a call, and use the vibrate / then ring feature.*  As other reviewers have noted, it is very slow to go through tasks.  If you are listening to the MP3 player and you get an incoming call, it will take a ridiculous amount of time for the music to stop and then allow you to accept the call.*  Sometimes, it just goes dead for no reason (not related to battery time).

My old phone went to bits and decided it did not want to work anymore. My main reason for purchasing this phone is because I was sick of being tied to certain mobile providers and wanted and a cute and sleek affordable, unlocked phone. This is it. The radio and music player is also a plus even though many phones have those features. What really reeled me in is the that MOTOROKER E8 does not have a keypad with physical buttons. The keypad lights up for your calls and differently for your music. With that feature you don't have to worry about buttons or your whole keypad tearing up like with my previous phones.One last thing is that with this phone and any other phone you can easily scratch it up. For this very reason you will need a case to protect it. Luckily with the seller that I bought this from one was provided and it does it's job.One minor thing. Does lag like other have stated but I've gotten used to it. I wasn't expected something spectacular. A phone is a phone to me.I'm not really into phones that have the whole kit and kaboodle.

My main problem with it is that it does not have an actual keypad-- rather, it has a flat surface that is touch-sensitive. I found this clumsy and awkward to use, and never got used to it.The phone itself is a bit bigger than you might expect. Annoyingly, the keypad lock doesn't cancel when you're getting a call, so you still have to fumble with the hold switch when you're trying to answer the phone.My phone gave me repeated error messages quite often because it had trouble synching to the network. The display also quickly became faulty, and the backlighting unreliable. Possibly my model was just a bit defective.The firmware gets very laggy if you don't turn the phone off every few days, and start-up is always very laggy, even when the phone is new.I did not use this phone for its music playing capability, so I can't comment on that.A few nice things about the phone: You select recipients of texts by checking boxes down your address list, which makes it easy to message many people at once. Also, the phone comes with a leather sleeve and a good pair of earbuds.For the reasons named above, I would not recommend this phone.", "Date": "November 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Phone is Not Responsive to Touch", "Author": "Music Fan", "ReviewID": "R19NEI0MXCUHVN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As other reviewers have indicated, the processor sometimes freezes up, which means that when you press a button, there can be a lag or delay before the phone processes that the button has actually been pressed.  The delays can be as short as a second or two, or can last for close to a minute.  This is particularly frustrating when a call is coming in and you press (and press and press) \"answer\", but the phone does not answer the call and it bounces into voice mail.  This doesn't seem to relate to using the memory to store music, since I don't have any music stored on my phone.  If I had known that I wouldn't be able to answer many incoming calls and would have problems using the buttons to make calls, I never would have bought the phone.  Super frustrating.

Russian text on the keys(just looks lame).  I feel like a complete idiot for buying this phone.  However, I was desperite and needed one fast and thought, \"why not for 100 bucks\".  This might not bother some, but the listed images reflecting the item purchased is not correct.Firmware updates are not available from Motorola.  T-Mobile updates are not available.  You'll have to do some research in order to find the correct settings for your phone.  Took me about a week.  My previous phones were all synched seemlessly intergrated.This phone also has TONS of lag when browsing through menus.  Doesn't matter what type, but I have found that, bluetooth will only add to the delay.The other thing I was gonna add is fact that the phone is in RUSSIAN.What's really weird about this phone is the speakerphone.  While playing music, it's great(for a phone) but during a phone call, it's average.  The speakerphone volume changes, why?  I dunno.  But it does, and it disapointed me as soon as I tried using it for a phone call.  Couldn't find any setting to try and tweak it.Bluetooth connections with headset pieces are sad compared to my last two phones, z6 and samsung.  Lots of digital static as if the phone was 20' or 30' away even though the ear piece and phone are less than 4' away from each other(cell in pocket/bluetooth headset in ear).I've used this phone for a more than 4 months and haven't had too many problems.  The cell phone's reception compared to the two previous phones is a 7/10.  I used to get a solid reception in my bedroom, now I have to go outside and stand infront of a planter in order to NOT drop a call.Though the expandable memory and internal memory sound like a plus.  The phone's internal system just added to the lag.  I kept everything on the SD card.  Thought this phone should have been called the lag.  Even with a brebone system with 1 mp3 on it, the phone still lags.  Really sad because this phone really looks cool!9/19/09I just added the data plan, omg... one thing to say...
