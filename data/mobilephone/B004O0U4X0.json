Besides, this is a great music device: you can listen to your own MP3s and also to FM radio stations (it will even display song titles in radio!). Quick, stable and well thought-through.

I thought to myself this is my kind of phone.Text Messaging & Picture Messaging;-I really like the full key board with a good size for the keys and huge space bar which was a personal favorite.-The conversational thread feature is great. No more inbox view but if you prefer it there is an option to switch. I like how everyone i texts had there own folder specifically for them. When you delete messages you can delete by folder which is very nice. The memory storage is amazing cause I'm someone who like to keep messages so i can back to read later for fun. The phone can keep tons of messages.-I like the T9 Prediction that helos me spell out huge words without typing out all the letters. I am a person who has to spell everything out so that a big help!-Picture Messaging format was kinda weird. When you open it hard to view your message so you have to do some playing around before you get a hang of it.-Making a picture message was a little simpler than viewing one but still kinda weird from normal phones so i suggest you play around with that as well.Phone Calls ;-Great sound quality!-Good speaker volume but could be just a bit louder for my taste-Making calls is pretty simple like any other phone but let say you typing a text message someone calls you and you accept. Your screen goes back to you typing the message not to the phone call screen. So you might get confuse sometimes whether you picked up the phone or not.-Ringtone volume is AMAZINGLY loud! Love it!Music, Radio , Camera & Picture Quality ;-Music volume with the earphones can be much improve. Im a loud room you won't ba able to hear the music very well.-Radio has a great feature, it shows you the title of the song which i think is way cool-Camera quality is okay but could be much more improve but it gets the job done.-Picture quality is not the bast kinda suckish if i do say myself. Very disappionted but all the other features make up for the lacking in that area.-When you full screen a picture it not clear as the orignal but blurry.-Zooming makes the picture very blurry as well.Web ;-Pretty good web feature for a pre-paid phone & price.-Can connect with Facebook, Twitter, & other popular social networking.-Load time is pretty quick but lags at time.-Good resolution on the screen.-Watching videos online might take awhile to load but GREAT quality. Go figure.Apps ;-Has your basic calculator, calender, timer, alarm clock, games, voice recorder, to-do list, notes, & etc.-the games that came with the phone is pretty fun wish there were more. my favorite is \"Bounce\" which is not a demo!!! so you have the full game!Settings (Home Screen, Ringtones, Security etc.) ;-WHEN YOU PUT YOUR PHONE TO CHARGE IT DOES NOT VIBRATE ONLY TUNES! i did not know this little tidbit cause my previous phones all vibrate whike charging. so i spent hours trying to work the seetings on my tones. just a little head up to ppl.-no , lighting change. only one type.-many different wallpaper & theme to choose from but if you want to use a picture that is not already included in the phone you will have horrible quality. it'll look like your looking at a blurry blob of color. another great disappointment.-you are able to customize your homescreen with this phone. i really like this features because it gives me so much shortcuts that i can get into my radio, converstions, pictures, web, camera, & other things just on my homescreen!-you can also have personal favorites on your screen which is a nice little feature!-I found that it doesn't show the date on your screen if you do choose to customize it but it an easy fix just have a shorcut to your calender on the home screen.Others ;-Visual voicemail which is great cause i can pick which message i want to listen too!-T-Mobile mall is great! many great things to buy!-Lock keys is very good way to not accidently dial or anything-Contact book good format-OVI Services avaible*PROBLEMS*-this phone is not 3G it's actually a 2.5G phone so it will lagg if your trying to go very fast* laggs if too many meesages come in at once* trying to go through menu options at a quick speed* screeen freezes from time to time if use too much-this phone has a GREAT battery life but takes forever to charge which is annoying at times!-leave the charger on when full battery make cause some lagging-messages in canversations might end up in the wrong folder at times which to fix turn off your phoneOverall this phone is a great phone for ppl who are big on texting & web who doesn't want a two year contract. Has some awesome features for a pre-paid phone. Worth every penny you spent on it.

I have to say this, after opening the box and inserting my T-Mobile Sim card, I was scratching my head and wondering if this was just another stupid cheap phone. I almost shoved everything back in the box and send back to Amazon for refund. I am an Iphone and Samsung Galaxy S 4G user and I just did not want to bother with this cheap phone. But I decided to dig in deeper and see what this phone can and can't do.First of all, if you are a touch screen person as I am , this phone is not for you.After playing with it for couple hours I started liking this little cheap phone even thought the internal memory suck big time and does not allow you to install many applications.1- I like it because I can have five emails set-up and it was very easy to do.2- I have all my Yahoo, MSN , Whatsapp and google messngers all installed and they work great. Also facebook and twitter apps come pre-installed.3- sending and receiving messages and picture message is simple and easy and fun.4- Sending Email is a snap. Also, you are alerted of new emails in your box.5- Surprisingly, the Camera is not as bad as you would think, its not the best but it does the job.6- The screen and display is really clear and pixels are not noticeable as someone mentioned.7-Be sure you go to OVI STORE and install Opera Mini browser and other apps that you can use on this phone. Not too many apps for this phone but I found Opera, Whatsapp.8-Battery life is great so far, I used it all night last night and day today and the battery still full.9- Music Player is great and so is the FM radio but u have to use the headphone to listen to Radio.10- This is not 3G but it is quite fast even using EDGE. I watched youtube and it was not really bad.The Cons:1- Internal memory sucks2- Small keyboard3- No volume controls on the side4- Not the fastest Internet but it does the jobThis is a good phone for price and sure does the job if you are not looking for something fancy. This is good for people who like to text and do social networking. I have decided to keep it and use as much as possible.

(I bought this phone back in March.)The only con to this phone is the keyboard. While it's great and has no problems, the pushing of the buttons is quite noisy.

I text a lot, so I needed a full keyboard. The keyboard is easy to use, buttons are large and labelled clearly. Clicking sound is a little noisy when pressing keys, but that's fine.2. Phone functionality - works great. No problems with calls. Good service, likely because I'm in a major city. Phone volume is fine, I can hear clearly and have received no complaints from the other end. Headset works.Pros:1. Easy to read screen, customizable home page, easy to customize keyboard shortcuts.2. FM radio/headset works good and compatible with RDS (tells you the station and the name of the song)3. Internet browser - I don't get online a lot, but I have used the internet browser to get a quick phone number. Easy to navigate. I turn off photo loading to make the page load faster/cut down on data fees.4. Works with Wal-Mart Family Mobile (just put in the sim card and start making calls).5. Compatible with Nokia software to backup contacts.Other observations:1. A little bulky, very noticeable in the pocket compared to my old 6500 classic.2. Cheap plastic casing - not a deal breaker for me. The plastic keeps it light weight,In conclusion - if you are on the phone a lot (I am for work) and like a full keyboard to text. This is the phone.3. Camera - not great, but gets the job done. My car got hit in a parking lot, took photos to send to insurance company. Nothing to cheer about but got the job done.I can't comment on:1. Social networking functionality (I don't need to know what my best friend in fifth grade is eating for dinner).2.

I got it because i thought it would be a perfect phone for me since I am not a big fan of smart phones and what not. I needed a new phone since my old one started acting up. Anyway when i received the item everything seemed to be going good. I took off the back cover to find that some of the hinges had been broken, at first i thought it would be no big deal since it probably occurred during shipping or something but then when I began to actually use the phone and started to text I noticed that the back cover was loose. Today is Saturday and I've been in class for most of the day. I got the phone delivered yesterday at around 6 pm or so. Seriously? I had it less than a day and this really isn't good. But hey overall the menus are easy to use, the calling and texting are ok, although i wouldn't say so about the auto text, which tends to fix every word you say into something longer. Example, I texted my friend what are you doing I'm about to get home, and it corrected it to \"what are you important get home.\" This also I didn't like. The actual qwerty keyboard seemed to be nice but the buttons are just way too small for me. he battery literally took forever to charge when i charged it, I left it on for about 8 hours straight, and it was already halfway full. Everything else on the phone I will not review since I haven't even had time to check all the things out.

I was looking for a cheap, affordable, yet good quality and useful phone. I got all that, and then some.Calling- 5/5- Call quality is great, especially for a non-smartphone. Voices sound crystal clear and has decent background noise canceling. With T-Mobile's plans, at least the one I have, calling people is cheap, and I even have a package that gives me 100 minutes, unlimited texts and unlimited data for only $30.Texting- 4/5- The texting on this phone is very fluent, with a full qwerty keyboard, it feels nice typing out words as supposed to a screen or a flip phone's number keys. Texts go through instantly with no lag whatsoever, and are received without lag as well, which with some phones, is a problem. You can turn off autocorrect, which is very helpful because autocorrect really takes away from the simplicity of texting.Design- 4/5- The design is a Nokia. So as expected, the hardware is spectacular, and the phone is pretty much indestructible. And I mean that in every sense of the word. The phone has a hard and very thick layer of plastic all around it. The screen is thick as well, so it doesn't crack nearly as easily. The screen instead however, scratches rather easily, which is not too big a problem, or becomes bad enough to detract from looks or user experience. The phone comes with a rather shallow 75mb of memory to store phone data as well as previous texts, and whatnot. The phone also has a very slow processor and a very tiny amount of RAM, which is terrible, but because this phone is not a smartphone, can easily be lived with. There is no volume rocker, which may sound insignificant, but is a big deal, because turning up and down the volume on the phone is so much more difficult than it needs to be. Last thing worth mentioning with hardware is that this phone has a micro sd card slot, which is a huge plus. You can watch movies, listen to music, save pictures and more with it.Software- 1/5- Now this is where this phone takes a HUGE dive. Nokia has always been known for superb hardware, very tough and longlasting phones, but their software has always struggled. This phone, unfortunately, suffers greatly from those same stereotypes. To start the interface on this phone takes some serious getting used to. It is unlike any kind of phone you've used without a doubt, and getting around the phone is a very tedious task for the first week or two of using this phone. This definitely detracts from overall experience. Also there are many known bugs with this phone in terms of its texting features. THe texting is fine, but every once in a while, your phone will decide to freeze entirely after sending a text and the \"Your message has been sent\" notification pops up. This gets very frustrating, and requires you to simply press the end button a few times to break out of the freeze. The solution to this problem came after many times this happening and finally finding out that this works. I'm sure many people didn't have the benefit of someone telling them how to unfreeze it. Next is a chronic freezing problem induced completely by random when the phone's memory is more than half full. Every once in a while, very rarely, but has happened to me three times since I got this phone a year ago, the phone will decide to freeze. Doesn't sound too bad right? Well with this freeze, you need to pop out your battery and turn it on. Catch is, is when you turn it back on it will freeze within about a minute of starting up.So you will have to keep popping out your battery and putting it back in until it stops freezing on startup. I have had this problem last up to two hours at a time, of continuous popping in and out the battery. This is SCARY this first time it happens because it seems like the phone is going to be frozen forever. You just have to keep trying to get it working again.Verdict-----3/5The phone is great for the price, with a practically indestructable body, a qwerty keyboard, good call quality, and nice texting. However, as stated above, the only real problem keeping this phone from a perfect 5/5 score is it's vomit inducing software that is buggy and glitchy to no end, to the point that it severely detracts from experience. It is a good buy for the price.

They all said it would work, but it doesn't. Apparently it's NOT compatible with OVI. It's a letdown because she can't download everything she had before, but she'll live.

It was a great phone, do NOT get me wrong. (Camera is extraordinary, by the way.) But due to our rural area and the fact the data portion of my carrier (T-Mobile) is not so hot in our region, I decided it was either change to the two carriers that have good data reception in our area....or perhaps, I didn't REALLY need a smart phone and I really LIKE not paying fiftyplus quatloos a month for cell service. I'm not much on cell phones, anyway. I use them for when I am out and can't be reached. Otherwise, not a big fan.In fact, I think the reason we see people gazing transfixed to their phones (while standing at the cash register, talking to you etc) is not because they can't tear themselves away from their smart phone but because it takes a long time to download a page over 4G or 3G. Ah-hum.So after a mighty search (worse than shopping for a car, far worse) I decided to stay with my pre-pay T-Mobile, go mainly for phone service and some messaging (very little) add a camera (for quick snaps) and a few web services like checking the market if I am out of the office. After examining all the Apple, Samsung, LG, HTC, Blackberry,  Motorola phones (all pretty cool phones), strangely enough, good ol' Nokia had exactly what I wanted.The Nokia X2 fit the bill. It's a great looking phone. The keyboard is not bad, the screen is bright. The screen icons are easy to use. It's not overloaded with bloat-o-rama apps I don't want and I spend about what you'd spend on two months of a contract for the phone and about all the minutes I use in a year. And since I'm gold status with T-Mobile as a ten year long customer, my minutes don't expire. I could not use my old sim card (the phone I replaced is so old it gets laughed at) but transfering my number over to the X2 took all of 2 minutes on the phone with T-Mobile and their customer service was acceptable (after I screamed REPRESENTATIVE nastily to the auto-bot menu, refusing to deal with its inane and irrelevant importunities for telling me what I already knew or didn't want to do.)The camera, frankly, sucks. It does the job but it has a lot of noise and doesn't live up to its megapixel billing. The focus was just as lousy when I left the protective membrane on the lens as when I remembered to remove it!The video cam is actually fairly good. It defaults to a short (three second or so) clip but you can change that. I find it very easy to use and useful.The lock feature--love love love. Easy to unlock (hit center button, then the uparrow function button lower left.)It plays MP3--pretty good. Replaces my Sansa clip and you can put in a micro SD card.The form factor-- a bit slippery. I added a case and some accessories as it doesn't come with a USB cord (but I had plenty of mini USB) and no carrier for the micro SD card to put into the computer--but it hooked up directly through a mini USB cable I happened to have. No car charger of course.So add some accessories (I think I paid all of ten-or-so quatloos for that) and you have a functional, easy -to-use phone with minimal investment, and you can pay as you go. Phone or My T Mobile to add minutes. Couldn't be easier.Summary: You want a budget cell phone with some features but aren't so fussy on camera, apps and really all you want is cheap and flexible service with a nice screen and a keyboard?

Once in a while, the phone would randomly mix up my conversation threads if I had more than one thread (messages from a conversation thread I had with John would end up in Mary's conversation thread in a random order.) Another gripe is the phone's tendency to shut off on its own. It would sometimes freeze as well. Also, it sometimes took forever to find signal in the most common of places.

However, there are a few little flaws. The phone is very slippery in your hand and if there is know case or skin giving it a grip it is very easy to drop, I'd pick it up and then it would just slide out of my grip a few times. Also the quality of the colors arent very good, and the camera quality is horrible. It is only a point 3 mega pixel camera, so if you are liking this phone and thinking the camera will be good...it's not. Sometimes I will write a text and press send but it doesn't send and it just stays at the text message screen. I will try to exit out but it is just froze there so i have to turn the phone off, then on again. Also the keys on this phone are very loud, so if you're trying to be quiet and text, it's not going to work on this phone.This phone has some great qualities though! The battery life is very long lasting. I could go 3 or 4 days without charging it and it would only loose one bar of charge. So battery life is great even with lots of use. Also you can download music from your computer onto the phone quickly without hassle. Great for listening to music on the go. This phone is also very easy to text on. Just press the message key and you can start creating your message. Call quality is good. Also there are games already loaded into the phone, which is good so you dont have to buy any. And the games are fun too.This is a good starting phone, and I've had it for a year and a half now. Planning on getting an upgrade once it hits 2 years. This is a good starting phone, but if you're planning on having it for 5 years I wouldn't reccomend it. Also after about a year, the keys start to wear down, so you can see the light underneath.

As others have noted the internet is not blazing fast, but you're working with a 2x3 screen so if your plan is throttled it will actually take you longer to cap out because the screen is smallish. The camera is nothing to write home about, resolution is fine when viewing on the phone and okay for sending via text but posting online will demonstrate it's shortfalls very quickly... Actual phone conversations are clear and ring/alert volume can be very loud if you wish it to be. The keyboard - once I became used to the tiny keys - is very easy to use, and for someone who does actually text a lot I like that feature the most (however, a few of my keys are starting to chip, no biggie when I'm used to qwerty, but annoying from an appearance standpoint). It's a good, solid phone and with the silicone case I found it has been dropped a few times with no damage - plus it *looks* good. The apps are nothing special, I use their basic Facebook and Twitter function - and had been using the chat program until suddenly I couldn't; the chat will no longer connect and gives me a \"check your connection settings\" message. Dunno what I did. Considering the price and the overall usability for my purposes, I would strongly recommend this phone to anyone looking to bridge the gap between smart phones and traditional phones - someone who wants a bit of social connectivity but not full-on internet experience...

I have had this phone only 2 months, and when the money runs out on my no-contract plan I'm going to take my lumps and ditch this phone. It looks like a Blackberrry, but lacks even simple necessities such as an audible tone (or a vibrate) every couple of minutes to let you know you have missed a call or text message. I have to physically pick up the phone and look at it to know I've missed a call or text. There is too little memory to download the card games I like, and the games that come with it are simple kid's games (and most are trials, not actual games). Except for Sudoku they are all simple kid's games. The camera's picture quality is horrible, as many other reviewers have already stated, and recorded videos are bad quality and difficult to locate. Disappointingly, internet navigation is so difficult and slow that I finally gave up on checking my email. Finally, today my battery died (remember- I've only had this phone 60 days) and I had to get a replacement battery from T-Mobile.Pros:  Large clear screen with great display.  Keyboard places often-used symbols (such as comma, @, and ?) in easy-access locations and does not require use of the function key to type them.  Can custom set navigation keys to access the apps you use most (camera, web, contacts).  Battery holds charge...forever.CONS:  No audible alerts that you have a missed call or text!  No way to load photos to SD card. Have to email them to myself.  T-Mobile network! Holes all over the \"coverage\" area, numerous issues with billing, and losing minutes to outer space with no explanation by T-Mobile as to what happens to them.Memory too limited for downloads.

The phone has no complications so far and is working fine. It is the most modern phone I have had up to date. Take note: if you want and can afford a smartphone, buy one. This doesn't have the full capabilities of a smart phone, and Nokia doesn't claim that it does.I personally was looking for a sleek, easy-to-use, not-too-pricey phone that has a QWERTY keyboard. It matches those needs. The home screen is attractive and there are some decent ringtones. I don't usually play games, but there are tons of free games that seem fun (even Sudoku). There is no scrolly keypad thing like the Blackberry has, nor does it have a touchscreen. I also need a music player, but I have to purchase the USB cable separately in order to transfer music. Another plus is the battery life is very strong. The phone arrived half-charged and I have only charged it once in the past week, and the battery is still full. Maybe that's why the screen shuts off quickly? I am using pay-as-you go (outdated maybe, but I honestly don't care) so I don't know about the plans. Only hope there isn't a better deal somewhere else (like Cricket?)I don't really know about the extra features that are more smartphone-like such as web-to-go, email, and social networking. It would be cool if I could use these \"apps,\" but they take forever to access and frankly its not that important to me.In conclusion, this phone should be more than adequate if you have basic expectations. It looks modern enough that no one will look at you funny when you pull it out, but neither will the phone turn any heads. If you are looking for the newest piece of technology, this isn't it. Buy an Android (or iPhone if you're really wild.)...Okay, not only did I purchase a customized USB cable, but now I need a specialized microSD card just to listen to music?

The buttons are very stiff, though this may go away with wear it is still very loud and obnoxious even to the user.  The case is solid, and slightly larger than a Black Berry though not much thicker.  It's sturdy, but made of much cheaper plastics.  In addition, instead of the scroll pad in the middle the X2 has a 4 way button pad which makes it feel very cheap.The interface also comes up short.  For starters, the screen resolution is pathetic.  I get the impression that what Nokia did was take a cheap regular cell phone and blow the screen up and make it look like a BB.  The screen resolution looks very poor on a screen this size, and the menu is not very easy to navigate (partly because of the poor controls mentioned earlier).  They did allow for e-mail to be checked from the home screen, which is the top thing I like about my BB, but it's not as fluid or seamless as the BB e-mail app.  Also, since it's a traditional phone it doesn't have alot of apps.This phone could have been better, but it probably also would have been alot more expensive.  It's all right for a cheap phone, but it does not replace a blackberry or even come close to matching one.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "EL TEL\u00c9FONO ME PIDE UN C\u00d3DIGO DE SEGURIDAD", "Author": "Rafael Robert", "ReviewID": "R1LJ5FO885SPCC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "ME ENCUENTRO EN VENEZUELA, EL TEL\u00c9FONO ME PIDE UN C\u00d3DIGO DE SEGURIDAD LE AGRADECER\u00cdA ME ENVIARAN UN NUMERO TELEFONICO O UN CORREO EMAIL PARA PODER COMUNICARME CON EL PROVEEDOR", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "needed to mention that this phone has no wireless capacity for the price charged", "Author": "Mark A.

I find out that OVI no longer supports this phone. Also, it constantly needs an update from my car whenever it tries to auto connect to the bluetooth. Sometimes whenever I try to make a call through the bluetooth or recieve a call, the person on the other end can not hear me. The only way to get it to work again is to take the battery out and put it back in to reset it. It takes the most awful pictures. I have never been more unhappy with any phone in my life than I have been with this one. I have had plain flip phones that work better than this one. This phone is good for making regular calls and texting, that is it. Do not expect to be able to do much with this phone. My expectations were a little too high when I got this phone and it was a major letdown.
