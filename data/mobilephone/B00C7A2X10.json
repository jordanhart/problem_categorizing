I purchased this phone not really knowing what i was going to get because they are a few others on amazon witch look very similar. I purchased mine in mid Sept 2013 for $135. okay it came pretty fast within 5 days i guess they have these in a warehouse somewhere in the states (from Prontec) already so they don't come in all the way from china. so i got the package opened it and there it was my note 2 clone. Now i'm going to tell you exactly what i got in the box. 1 phone model N7100 NOT the \"S7100\" from what I can tell the diference between the two is that the N7100 is a newer model and it has the front facing camera on the right side not the left. i got 2 batteries 3100mah an extra flip back cover, cheap headphones (went straight in the garbage) a mini usb cable and charger (north american plug not eruo) and a instruction book. I did a benchmark test on the phone using antutu v4.0.2  scored 8285 which is comparable to a Samsung Galaxy S2. The real Samsung galaxy note 2 scores at over 20000.the battery life is good at the end of the day it around 50%. the build quality is excellent screen is bright and responsive. it comes with stock jellybean. nothing to complain about so far except i cant find a case for it, they sell s7100 cases on ebay so i bought one hoping it will fit but havent received it yet. For around $150 you cant go wrong the huge screen and dual core cpu is what won me over. i think generic phones like this will become more popular in the future as phones have become more and more like computers and i know a lot of people who have built there own generic computer which can out perform many \"name brand Computers.im in Canada and my rogers sim card does work !", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Fredric Sellers", "ReviewID": "R1T6F8Y2S80215", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone comes with the latest jellybean os,it has most all the bells and whistles,and is very nice to look at.It is all ready to hook to your pc just plug it in and let it do its thing.Put your sims and sd cards in set your apn if needed and start talking.Big screen,very responsive and load speaker.Phone had screen protector already installed,came with 2 batteries and a back cover that is a screen cover too.This phone has plenty of storage space and is right for the price.Now if you need a case or another screen protector you can not just go buy a note 2 product its close to fit but no wano,just look in the sellers store and you will find many different options.Dont hesitate about this phone it is worth the time.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Marquetta F.", "ReviewID": "R260OEC8JQUM4I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I order this for my friend an she loves it.

I was so excited about it. The first phone's camera flash and flashlight app didn't work properly or at all at times. I emailed the seller and she emailed me promptly within 24 hours. I had recently transferred my number and service and really needed a phone. I asked the seller if she would send me another phone since it takes so long to receive it in the mail and once I received the new one, I would send back the defected one. She agreed and did just that. When I received the second one, it seemed perfect! Everything on it worked properly...at least the flash did. First of all, I went to a relative's funeral and took pictures of family members that I hadn't seen in a while and when I later went to retrieve the pictures, none of them were saved to the phone nor my sd card. That was very upsetting. Besides that, when I would receive a call, the phone would completely power off and immediately back on several times within a single call. Even in the middle of the night when I would charge it, it would power off and never come on unless I take the battery out then power it on. However, when I contacted the seller once more about the issues with both phones, she offered a full refund once I return the 2 phones...which was a great thing on the seller's part. I really liked the style and size of the phone but the experience was disappointing, especially the second time around...Guess that's what happens when you try to get a $600 Samsung look alike for only $200.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "WARNING!

BUYER BEWARE!", "Author": "Gregg L. DesElms \"Gregg L. DesElms\"", "ReviewID": "R3HGXGREGOMAW8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "WARNING: THIS IS NOT A SAMSUNG brand GALAXY NOTE II PHONE! IT IS A CHEAP CHINESE KNOCK-OFF!And it's not even really a bargain, at that. If it at least matched the specifications of the actual Samsung Galaxy Note II, yet still cost the same as this one, then THAT at least might be something to at least consider... but ONLY consider, as far as I'm concerned.For the record, the phone that this one is trying to confuse you into thinking it might be has four times the \"internal\" SD storage (what this phone calls \"ROM\"), and four times the memory (RAM) that this knock-off has. The REAL Samsung Galaxy Note II also has a quad-core processor, whereas this cheap one has only a dual-core.One of the biggest things you'll notice with this knock-off phone, though -- especially if you ever lay it on a table next to a REAL Samsung Galaxy Note II -- is the really crappy, by comparison, screen of this phone. The Super-AMOLED screens that Samsung makes for the Galaxy-family phones is unbelievable! They have the whitest whites, and blackest blacks (so, in other words, their contrast is excellent... superior, even), and brightest and most beautiful colors you'll ever see on a phone. Any phone -- and I mean ANY phone, including an iPhone, or an HTC, or a Motorloa, or... well... any of them -- which you lay on a table next to a Samsung Super-AMOLED screen will look downright pale, even at full brightness, compared with a Samsung Super-AMOLED screen.Additionally, according to its description, this phone is only a 3G phone; whereas the REAL Note II is a 4G phone. And, of course, this phone cannot possibly have the Samsung TWLauncher on it.Seriously, SHAME ON AMAZON for even allowing this product to be sold bearing a TRADEMARKED name!And no end-user should have anything to do with it.__________________________________Gregg L.
