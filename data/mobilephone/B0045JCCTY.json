I am not your typical savy electronics user. I am an average joe with a nack for abusing cell phones. I have gone through dozens maybe even approaching the hundreds mark. I have had mishaps including but not limited to dropping my phone to the bottom of the lake, sitting on them, running over one with my truck, and even teeing one up and whacking it with my 6 iron. This includes infinite times dropping them and exposing them to the iminent doom of water. In all my years of carrying a cell phone none has proven to be worthy of praise like my samsung galaxy s vibrant.My first serious mishap with it was only a couple of months after getting it. Being a fan of swype I pulled the phone out of my pocket, swyped to unlock, and swyped it right into a 5 gallon bucket of water inconveniently next to me. With only a zagg screen protector and no case on it I immediately expected the worst but shook it off anyway, took out the battery, and let it dry for about an hour. Worked without any problems. That weekend I sat around retelling the story to a few of my buddies over a couple beers (all of them iphone junkies) and I was getting comments of doubt from all of them. They assumed that all phones were as delicate as the doomed to water damage or inevitable screen spider web that most iphones seem fated and that I must be exhaggerating. Still ever confident in my phones now proven abilities, fueled by their doubt, and even some liquid courage I threw my phone into the middle of the table and emptied my almost full beer on top of it. All eyes around me now fixated on my phone, I shook it off and proceeded to call my buddy next to me. Jaws could be heard dropping in the now almost silence. I dared any of them to follow suit.... no takers.Finally, to my most recent mishap. I am now approaching the 2 year mark of carrying my proclaimed superhero of phones but just last week I again put it to the test. I was out to lunch with a buddy when I left the table, phone in hand, headed for the restroom. I walked up to the urinal and almost immediately as if in a slow motion nightmare dropped my beloved phone. I was struck immediately by horror and stunned for what felt like minutes as it plummeted to it's murky grave. When I finally overcame my disgust I did what I thought was a waste of time and even a compromise of good hygene and pulled it out and tossed it into the sink while I concluded its sentence of either death by drowning and tossing it into the trash or attempting to revive it. My disgust would not allow me the logical choice of pulling the battery out just aa my loyalty would not let me just cut ties and leave it in the trash of the restroom of a sushi restaurant. I just did the only thing I could think of. Covered it with handsoap and scrubbed it until I felt as though paint might soon start coming off. Then I took out the battery and let the parts dry. An hour later I turned the phone on without any damage I tried to convince myself the whole day was a horribly bad dream.~ posted from my samsung galaxy s. :)", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "extremely good!", "Author": "gumiero", "ReviewID": "R1LKGX5Y3SA8E5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a perfect phone! i have upgraded it to 2.2 Froyo with Samsung Kies without any problem and now it's faster and save a lot of battery with simple tasks!The only con that i found is that i can't find how to put a Portuguese-BR in the swype keybord with a T9 Portuguese language!The swype keyboard is extremely fast!Everything in this phone runs smooth and fast!", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "I LOVE this phone :)", "Author": "LaceBomb", "ReviewID": "R3QTABYG3WQNPD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Beautiful display, takes amazing pictures, has great sound quality, love the touch screen.

The GPS does not find a location most of the time, and when it does, it often takes a long time. This is a problem if you're trying to take a geotagged photo or obtain driving directions, but it is even worse if you are calling 911 and can't tell them your location.The GPS problems with this phone are widely documented. Promises from Samsung and T-Mobile to fix the GPS with software in 2010 never materialised. Consequently, I received a replacement phone in July 2011, only to find that it still had the GPS problems.If you want your phone to double as driving/walking directions, mapping, or even finding your way back to your car, this phone cannot do the job.The Good: Great super-AMOLED display; Call quality is good.The Bad: GPS seldom works", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Vibrant is a TERRIBLE phone", "Author": "Anon9998", "ReviewID": "RCEDK3BRIH9IX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this phone since December 2010.  It is now October 26th, 2011.  This phone is a time consuming, problematic, challenge to your ability to manage your time effectively.  The first week I had this phone the music player would start on it's own while sitting peacefully on the coffee table.  It came loaded with Android 2.1 but with a promise to upgrade very quickly to 2.2.  2.2 would allow you to play videos on the internet.  Without 2.2 the only thing you could watch was Youtube.  2.2 came out months after promised.  Here are my thoughts:Pros:+Decent Sound+Customizable home screen and number of pages (7 pages is default)+Large storage built in+Ease of Dis-assembly+Beautiful screen+Doesn't physically break after being thrown out of frustration at least 12 times (with the rubberized cover)Cons:-Can't stop the SUPER LOUD turn off sound regardless of apps you install and regardless of the settings-Randomly doesn't allow you to answer a call.-Text messages constantly FAIL.  It takes like 20 seconds then buzzes telling you the message FAILED.-The 2.2 update made all text messages with attachments fail.  T-Mobil said any number with a 1 in front of it is the problem.  They were aware of it but unaware of when a fix would be available.  You have to erase the \"1s\" in front of every phone number in your contact list.-Randomly deletes your contact list, including your entire GMAIL contact list.  I went back to my G1 so I could stop being frustrated by this Samsung Vibrant.  I gained root access on the G1 and deleted the Google Partner app.  That not only broke the phone but when I re-installed my SIM card back into the Vibrant the Vibrant proceeded to delete my entire contact list and my GMAIL linked account Contact list.-The contact management software will combine like names all into the first like name into the list.  I am in the ARMY and created a bunch of contacts with Sergeant as the first name.  When I received calls from different sergeants only one name would show up.  Turns out, the Vibrant's contact management combines like names into one contact and just lists all the numbers.  Some Android phones have a way to fix that, but NOT the Vibrant.-Screen \"on\" and \"off\" button on right upper side and is hit on accident constantly-texting with on screen keyboard is horribly laggy and inaccurate-Lots and Lots of LAG-Samsung Kies software required to connect the Vibrant to your computer (HUGE Download)-Samsung Kies sees phone intermittently-I have wasted at least 20 hours trying to connect the phone to the computer successfully after it worked fine the day before (windows 7 64 bit, i5 processor computer with the latest drivers and all appropriate software downloaded and installed)-Market application randomly works, then doesn't work.  You have to go deep into the menu system and stop the application and erase all the user data...it's such a hassle and time consuming.-Music player randomly paused, switched songs, came on, turned off all on it's own.  It was as if the phone was possessed.-The phone is EXTREMELY slippery without the purchased separately rubberized cover-Battery randomly drains super fast, and other times works perfectly.-Lately my data connection is completely gone.  Tmobil customer care has reset my connection, and I have removed the battery and SIM card, restarted, but the data connection is still missing in action.  The Wifi still works and connects just fine at home, but the data connection to their network is completely gone.-Samsung refuses to support their own product.  They keep releasing new versions of the Vibrant, and will not upgrade any of the older models software.  I don't know about anyone else, but I don't plan on having to buy a new phone every single year if I don't have to.  Imagine if car dealers sold you a car they wouldn't offer parts or repairs on.  Supporting Samsungs Vibrant is supporting poor customer support.  T-mobil on the other hand has been AWESOME.  I have been with them since like 2005.  Despite my phone not working at all since I arrived at my duty station in El Paso, because of a lack of service on the part of the base where I am, I still think T-Mobil has been great.I hope this helps anyone else considering this phone.  Please do your diligence.  Spend some time reading about this phone's pros and cons.  I have read there are ways to improve this phone if you want to void your warranty (I don't).  Decide if you want to install a file management system from the market, download a root access program, install a new ROM and hope you don't make a mistake and brick your phone.  It appears the only people that enjoy this phone are people who like to completely wipe the existing software and install their own customized version because they have endless time to work through all the bugs and issues.  Good luck!Update 18 November, 2011Good news: Resetting the phone brought back my data connection.Bad News: The phone still cannot be found by my computer using Samsung Kies software or as a mass storage device.  I have adjusted all the settings, spent hours reading forums, had expert friends help me, all to no avail.  I pulled the micro SD card out and put it in a card reader to see if my 400 pictures I took at the zoo were on the sd card and they weren't.  One forum suggested reformatting the SD card and it might help with connecting to the computer.  I erased the sd card but it still doesn't work with my computer.  Even worse then that, even though my pictures weren't on the sd card, reformatting the card erased all 12 gb of pictures, home movies, and AVI files I had in the phone's internal memory even though the reformat sd card doesn't say anything about erasing the entire phones memory.  This phone is just a giant pile of time waster.  If you have endless time to spend trying to use your phone like a normal person would, this phone is definitely for you.  If, however, you just want a phone that works and enhances your life, DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS PHONE.More Bad News: I had to drive my wife to the emergency room at 10pm at night because she couldn't breath and her throat was closing.  I had my step daughter trying to call the hospital to make sure the ER was open and to ask questions about what to do if my wife stops breathing.  The call kept dropping and the phone would go back to the Password LOCK screen.  As soon as the call would drop my step daughter would have to hand the phone back to me while I am driving so I could enter my phone Password.  After 11 dropped calls on the 50 minute drive, I ended up just giving her the password.  This phone's software needs some serious re-working.  Every time a call is dropped or ended the screen should not instantly go back to the password lock screen.SOLUTION?:T-Mobil solution to changing out my phone: I went into the one of their stores last weekend.  I spoke with a sales person who really knew his stuff and was very helpful.  He said T-Mobil stopped carrying the Samsung Vibrant pretty quickly after it was launched because it had so many problems.  Unfortunately for me, if I want to change phones, I either stay with the current plan and get a minor discount on purchasing a new phone which extends my contract two more years, or change plans to a better plan and pay a $150 migration fee and buy a new phone outright.  They ask you to pay a percentage of the phone upfront then let you make payments on the rest of the price of the phone.  T-Mobil does offer a cool new plan though.  $100 a month for two phones with unlimited everything but no discount on the phone and it is locking in another two year contract on both phones.  If I want to upgrade to a new phone with a full size keyboard like the MyTouch 4G Slide I have to pay $480 ($240 each phone) + $150 migration fee all upfront and agree to a two year contract.Hope all this updated info helps.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2EAV5SWK54OH9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only complaint is at times I have a hard time hearing, but not always and others say they have a hard time hearing me.

At the time I bought it, back about a year ago, it was cutting edge and my first smart phone. With the plan I'm on, I use a prepaid sim card in it and only pay 15 dollars a month for texting. I still can use most of the features it offers though through it's wifi capabilities. The screen is still one of the best on the market in my opinion. The battery is fine for me since I don't use the 3g all day long, nor the wifi. It can usually stay charged all day with mild usage. But over time I noticed the battery life was shortening, and after about 10 months I had to purchase a new battery on amazon just to use it all day.  Only like 7 bucks on amazon for a new battery. The camera is lacking. No flash is much more annoying than I thought it would be. But everything else seems to keep up with all my friends new phones.

Wright", "ReviewID": "RO6KZIGNUWP86", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had my Vibrant for almost a year, and it's served me well, though it does have a handful of mostly minor shortcomings.Pros:- Awesome AMOLED screen that's large, sharp and rich. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it from people checking out my phone. Also, I've never used a screen protector and yet the Gorilla Glass construction has kept it scratch-free.- Huge 16 GB built-in memory. Most users will probably never have to resort to using the SD card (I haven't).- Fast 1 GHz processor. Runs apps, video and mid-range games very well.- Very light at 4.2 oz. I was shocked the first time I picked up an iPhone and realized how heavy they are by comparison.- Good call quality and reception. Never had any problem with dropped calls or \"death grip\" signal loss.- T-Mobile service. Since I bought the phone outright online, I'm on a no-contract plan with T-Mobile for $60/month with unlimited data and text and 500 anytime minutes. Haven't seen a deal elsewhere that competes with that (though please leave a comment if you know of better).Cons:- Poor execution of navigation features. The GPS is very slow to lock on, Google Maps seems to crash the phone every 1 out of 10 times, and the compass doesn't seem to stay calibrated very well. It's very frustrating when trying to find directions or navigate for someone who's driving when these features don't perform. Supposedly regularly downloading GPS assistance data through apps like GPS Status helps, but I haven't noticed much of a difference. This is probably not the phone for you if will be relying on navigation services with any frequency.- Fairly clumsy interface between the phones contacts and your Google contacts. If you don't manager your contacts through Google, this will be a non-issue, though.- No flash for the camera. If you want to take photos in dimly lit situations (like restaurants or bars) or use your phone as a flashlight, you're pretty much out of luck.- Battery life is on the short side, though not terribly unusual for a smartphone with these features.- Still running Android 2.1 and probably no chance of a future update.- No tethering feature- The default call volume is very low, though this can be corrected by turning on the HAC mode under Settings/Call Settings/HAC mode.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good phone, but some problems", "Author": "Jimi", "ReviewID": "R3HW4ZAEV2DM7C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone as an upgrade from a cliq which ran 2.1 and it is is a NIGHT AND DAY difference! The 1ghz cpu lets me play games that were choppy on the old phone. I use the vibrant for pretty much everything. I love the extensive file formats it supports, WMV, MP4, FLV, AVI and etc!!! The touch-screen is very reponsive, the display is very, very, vibrant and shows rich colors. The only negative things I have to say about this phone is, sometimes when I receive calls, the call session just ends by itself, and sometimes the videos won't play. Some processes will become unresponsive (like the video, facebook, pandora) if the video won't play and it is a supported file format and it was playing fine earlier, you just need to reboot the phone and it should be fine. Also one thing I dislike is the phone isn't that loud. The music player interface is nice and simple. The battery life is decent when you have, wifi, 3g and gps all turned off. if the battery life is still pretty short for you, you can find a slightly larger battery which holds a longer charge.

Pierson", "ReviewID": "R1OY1M685JHDY4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "To put it simply, I absolutely loved this phone except for one critical problem - the GPS never worked despite having 3 different ones sent to me by T-Mobile. Even after upgrading to 2.2 and using Samsung's GPS Restore app, I was never able to get a signal on any of the 3 Vibrants I received from T-Mobile as replacements. This may seem like a small issue but when you own a $500 phone, you expect all of the features to work as advertised, especially ones you use on a regular basis.I have a few gripes about the time it took to upgrade to Android 2.2 and the fact that it will probably never get Android 2.3 but this seems to be a standard issue with Samsung. In my opinion you are better off buying HTC or another brand if you want to stay with the Android OS upgrade path.Because of the GPS issues I had with my phone I replaced it with a HTC Sensation 4G. But overall if you don't care about potential GPS issues, this is a great purchase and you can probably get one really cheap right now.What I like:- The SuperAMOLED screen is gorgeous. There really isn't a better screen out there. Movies look fantastic and that alone is what makes this phone shine.- People have commented in reviews across the web that it feels cheap because it is an all-plastic body but I appreciate how light it is in my pocket and I think it feels anything but cheap.- It isn't as fast as some of the dualcore phones that were just released (HTC Sensation) but has plenty of power for most people's needs.- Plenty of storage. With 16 GB of built-in storage you won't run out of space.- The gorilla glass is awesome. No need for screen protectors!What I don't like:- the GPS is useless. Didn't function on any of the 3 I owned from the time I got them. Some people have no problems but this is a known issue and T-Mobile will give you huge hassles about replacing it.- Consider yourself stuck on Android 2.2. For most people this won't matter at all. In fact, I hardly noticed a difference after upgrading from 2.1 but it may mean future apps may not be supported. Samsung is terrible about updating their phones.- Touchwiz is nothing special. I'd prefer vanilla Android or SenseUI. The interface seems a bit cumbersome and I often had silly issues with stuff like contacts not syncing, etc. Plus, the majority of the bloatware costs money or isn't worth taking up the space and can't be removed.- It looks pretty much exactly like and iPhone. That isn't necessarily a bad thing except when you don't want to look like an iFan.- Signal bars and battery indicator are not even close to being accurate. In fact it rarely showed any bars but I always had reception.- Battery time was terrible.

ALSO LIMITS THE PHONE TO ACHIVE THE TRUELY POTENTIAL THAT ARE INSIDE THE GPU AND CPU(BELIEVE ME, COULD DELIVER MORE POWER WITH OVERCLOCKING) .FOR ME THIS NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE IM JUST CHANGE THE SAMSUNG ROM FOR ANOTHER ROM LIKE GALAXY EXTREME FOR START, BUT FOR THE AVERAGE USER THIS COULD BE A PAIN IN THE ASS.TO RESUME:PROS- SUPER RESPONSIVE 4'SUPER AMOLED SCREEN- FAST CPU AND GPU (EVEN ON STOCK CLOCK FRECUENCIES, IMAGINE RUNNING THIS BEAST TO 1,6GHZ STABLE WITH SOME KERNELS)- ITS VERY LIGHT EVEN WITH THE PROTECTIVE CASE SET (LIKE 140GR)- ITS YOU WANT AND ALTERNATIVE TO THE XPERIA PLAY AND VERY LESS EXPENSIVE, THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO CHOOSE.CONS- THE TOUCH WIZ IS BUGGY ON THE GPS LOCKING- THE UI EATS TO MUCH RAM, YOU CAN OPTIMIZE THE USER RAM USING OTHER ROMS- THE WEB NAVIGATION GETS SLUGISH ON SOME PAGE WITH FULL FLASH CONTENT (CAN GET BETTER OVERCLOKING THE CPU)- DOESNT HAVE A FRONT CAMERA", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Jiwhan", "ReviewID": "R1BTGLU4H32VPK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used many different iphones in the past and I was getting tired of the exact same pattern and the annoying use of itunes. I wasn't sure if I wanted to switch to android so I decided to buy the Samsung Galaxy Vibrant and try the android out. I know there is the new Android 4.0 ice cream sandwich and that this phone will not be able to get the update unless you get a customized version but I did not want to spend buying a 4~600 dollar phone to just try it out. I bought this phone used and the product was better than I expected. I turned the phone on and the screen was amazing. I navigated through and downloaded all the apps I needed without any problems. I plugged my german sim card in and phone connected instantly. Only problem I do see is that I do notice slight more lag on the phone than I did on the iphone. But it doesn't bother me that much and I am very pleased with how far android came and the quality of samsung phones. I had no problem with batteries but I decided to buy aftermarket batteries which works very well.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "I gave up after 6 months", "Author": "Bryan Phillips", "ReviewID": "R1C6XGC6E19P70", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First off, the design of the phone was not made for human hands. Better have suction cup fingers because hitting the power button will shoot it straight out of your hands. You will probabaly end up throwing it more out of frustration though. A rubber casing is a must! Everytime I really needed a feature to work such as GPS I would have been better off to use a manual compass. You have to use Windows XP to upgrade to 2.2. If there is another way, I'm sure it would take hours maybe even days to figure it out. Everytime I tried to use Facebook it would never load. I ended up having to download 2 additional apps just to get facebook to work. After 6 months I gave up. I spent too many hours of my life that I will never get back just trying to get a fix for all the problems I had with this phone. So when you have to reset, you have to spend several hours getting the fixes all over again. If you value your time and need less frustration, I recommend looking for a diffrent phone.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Performance and too much Lag", "Author": "Sridharan Kuppa \"Kuppa S\"", "ReviewID": "R1X3L2QAUZMNVQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone after reading all the review but after two weeks and I regret for this phone due to its poor performance.  Don't get cheated by 1GB processor.  Let me give some fact about this phone,  this phone uses the RFS file system (Robust File System) which is worst file system.  The performance of the file system is very bad, it is like a accessing your old computer 1.4MB floppy disk.  Whenever there is a IO operation, it freeze the phone, too much lag with white screen or blank screen.  When the phone is locked and there is an IO operation going on then you can not unlock the phone.  If you want to make emergency call then you have hard reboot by holding the power button for 15 seconds.  It is very frustrating.  I did hard reset (factory default) 3 times and I sent it Samsung too.  The Samsung did not even try to reproduce the problem, they simply hard reset and send it to me, which is more frustrating too.  I called TMobile, they are willing to replace the phone but I don't think this problem will be fixed.  If you don't believe it, then google it \"Samsung Vibrant Lag\" and you will find lot of blog/forum which is discussing about it.  There is a fix available in the market but you will be losing your warranty.  You can use RL SQL bench mark and see the performance for IO, you will really get pissed and I guarantee that.  If you download GoogleFinance or Bloomberk app then you can realize when you open the app and going between the tab.Pros: Bright DisplayCons:IO Performance issueBattery drains very fastNeed to hard reboot once every two dayNeed to hard reset once every month.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "1GHz Samsung Hummingbird processor\n4-inch Super AMOLED Capacitive Touchscreen display\n5 MP Camera\nAndroid 2.1\n16 GB of built-in memory for photos, videos, music and more", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant GSM Phone - Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51eDJI%2By0qL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0045JCCTY"}}
