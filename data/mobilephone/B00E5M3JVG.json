Also there were problems with using the calendar on Android. I have now synced all my outlook email accounts (including gmail) with my Lumia. The outlook calendar now works well.I was worry about the apps, but actually I have everything I need. I even use google maps.The battery life is spectacular. I go on for 2 days on a single charge as I do not use it as phone that much, however, I do a lot of radio streaming and use data/emails/web all the time.The voice call quality is outstanding.I also uploaded some music to Lumia and it automatically downloaded covers - all this without using iTunes.The camera is good, probably and overkill for my needs. There is a separate button, just for the camera, and you can take pictures without going through waking up the phone and unlocking.I travel a lot and this phone is simply spectacular.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone...", "Author": "Cat N.", "ReviewID": "R11YSKG5HSU2G9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wasn't sure if I wanted a Windows phone.... I have had both iPhones and Androids with my latest phone being the Galaxy S4, which is a great phone.  However, after buying a laptop/tablet hybrid which had Windows 8 loaded I became more intrigued with the metro style of Windows.  Once you get used to it, I like it a lot.  Everything is fairly well integrated and you can easily move between programs and access programs quickly.  The live tiles are great, I just wish maybe they gave you another page instead of one big long page for the tiles.Now, this phone specifically is very snappy.  I really haven't had any lag and the photos taken by the phone are phenomenal.  I can quickly access the camera with a quick press/hold of the camera button and it is open and I am snapping photos fast.Cons:  The app store is a bit light on programs but that is improving daily.  Also, the back of the phone has the lens raised up a bit so it makes it a bit awkward to hold at certain angles.  A case I have on order should take care of that as many commenters regarding that product said it helped with this awkward feel.So, if you want a phone that is more customizable than an iphone and not as complicated as an Android - then a Windows phone is for you and I think the Lumia 1020 is the best one our there right now for this OS.  Buy it!", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great service from Amazon A grear pocket camera", "Author": "Pavel Muller \"Nokia Lumia 1020\"", "ReviewID": "R21JXFIDEC9VT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a serious photographer and so having a camera around me at all times is a great thing. That is the sole weakness of my full frame DSLR system and the Nokia 1020 (Microsoft 1020 now?) fits the bill. For review of the camera look elsewhere - there are many and all are positive.Actually, I did not purchase the phone from Amazon. Why? I placed the order with one of the companies associated with Amazon. They took the money and disappeared. When the phone did not arrive at the time it was supposed to, I had to fill a relatively simple online form with Amazon. I was not the only one duped, so Amazon knew about this company and the association was cancelled. I called Amazon shortly after filling the form. I talked to a very pleasant lady that appreciated the discomfort and frustration I felt, promptly processed my request for reimbursement and I received the money promptly. Great service Amazon!!!! although I hope you will not have to go through this.I purchased Nokia 1020 from another online vendor. For me the surprise is the Windows 8 environment. This is my first smartphone, so I do not have in mind anything to compare it to. It does not seem too difficult to learn to use it. Everybody talks about a dearth of apps. Perhaps this is an issue if you want a specific app that is not available on Windows or if you are an app collector. If you just want a couple of apps to do a few basic things (GPS, VOIP, Battery utility etc.), you have great many apps to choose from (free and for pay), and some of them seem good.Aesthetically, the phone is sleek, it fits comfortably in my hand and feels substantial. It meets my expectations based on my reading before the purchase and I am pleased.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "wow what a great phone!", "Author": "sunshine", "ReviewID": "RS90V1DR8YOMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nokia Lumina 1020 is the best Windows Phone there is.

I love the 41 megapixel camera on this device which easily surpasses my IPhone 5's 8 megapixel ISight Camera. The pictures taken from this camera is absolutely stunning. Images are captured in gorgeous and very impressive detail. I was breath taken by the image quality and color when I took my first picture. It is amazing. The Nokia Lumia 1020 far surpassed my IPhone 5's pictures in terms of color and image quality. I also like how the camera comes with optical image stabilization to help eliminate the effects of blurry images taken b shaky hands. I do exactly have the steadiest hands in the world so the optical image stabilization is a great help.Aside from the camera I also like Nokia Lumia's matte finish in a yellow color. The design and appearance of the phone is great. I really love the large screen and its stunning visual layouts.On the software side this phone runs on Windows 8 OS which isn't super awesome in terms of user friendliness. It takes some time getting used to.In terms of hardware the Nokia Lumia has a 4.5 inch screen made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is quite strong and durable. It also comes with a 1.5 GHz Snapdragon S4 processor.On the other hand I don't really like the camera's protruding lens. I found I quite annoying to be touching it every time I held up the phone. The phone is also a little bit on the heavy side. About 50 grams heavier than the IPhone 5 and is bit heavier than most smartphones but it isn't a drag on my pants or anything.

Burgess", "ReviewID": "RHBYJE0L4NTW8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an exceptional phone, easy to use, very intuitive and GREAT camera. However there are some drawbacks that I came to not like after 3 months of use, end recently sold the phone to get the iPhone 5s.Camera:The camera and the video recorder render great results, but it takes longer to get the camera open (even when using the side button) and to finally take a shot versus the iPhone. As a result I missed out on catching some moments while visiting my friends baby because the camera didn't open fast enough. I'm not saying this is a drawback to not buy, but if you are not a photographer but more of a 'heat of the moment' camera phone / Reddit user who posts funny shots, then you might miss out because of the lag.Also, someone mentioned the up-close shots not working. It's true. You can switch to macro and spend time adjusting settings, but problem is you can't get truly up close to an object. I was trying to shoot jewelry pics to share a photo of my engagement ring and I had to take shots from about 5 inches away and then crop them. Obviously this is just a small drawback because I should truly be using a DSLR if I need high quality macro shots. But I was disappointed. I actually went to a Microsoft store to get help using the camera and I still couldn't get up close shots to work correctly.Operating System:I bought this phone for the camera, but after 3 months I barely used it enough to warrant the change to Windows. I think the problem is I was spoiled with some great apps on the iPhone (native instagram app, Flipboard, educational apps). Instagram and Flipboard are finally releasing a Windows version but it won't be out until January 2014 (most likely). I used those apps daily and the substitute apps for instagram are just not as fluid and easy as the original.After a month, I was barely using the phone compared to my old iPhone 4s. It would just sit in my bag and I'd take an occasional photo and just text message. I now realize just how much I wasn't utilizing it after switching back to iPhone.Music:Compared to the iPhone, the music setup on the Lumia 1020 is terrible. It's not intuitive, and if for instance you are listening to a song on your headphones or AUX cable in your vehicle, you need to turn up the volume considerably, but when you detach the cable the phone doesn't realize that you did this. It stays on full volume. Imagine getting a phonecall on 30/30 volume. The iPhone recognizes the changes automatically, so this was a drawback after a while since I use a AUX cable setup in my car.Gps/Directions:Best maps software period. Directions don't require data if you download them on home first via wi-fi. I would recommend this phone for heavy gps users / travelers.Various:It took me 2 months to figure out how to use 'linked inboxes' so if you're struggling to use outlook, do yourself a favor and go online and watch a 2 minute video. The mail functions in this phone are unparalleled. Also, being able to edit microsoft word documents is great. It was another reason I bought the phone and I barely used to be honest, but it is GREAT when you need it.My brother has had windows phones since they first came out, swears by them, and loves them. He connects via his Xbox account and likes to keep everything within the same ecosystem from phone, computer, tablet, gaming. This is a wonderful aspect to Microsoft, much like the Apple ecosystem offers the iPad, Macbook, iPod, iPhone. I personally have all the those apple devices so it was hard to transition to using a Windows phone, where I can't transfer things as easily. There is a Windows Phone program you can download to your Mac Computer to easily transfer files, you can download via the Microsoft support site.Glitches:When resetting the phone to factory settings, it took 16 hours of spinning gears, multiple hard resets, until it let me setup the phone for the person I was selling to. 16 hours. I was disgusted. After reading the same problem online for other users, I realize that some phones take 30 minutes and one guy said it took him 24 hours to factory reset the phone. I thought I had bricked the device about 3 hours in, but low and behold it came back to life the morning after I started. This is unacceptable. Microsoft released a patch for this but you need to experience to fix it and I didn't take the time to. Frankly, I shouldn't have to for a 800$ phone.Overall:If you want a powerful camera on a phone, like windows 8, and don't mind less apps, this is the phone for you. If you are however in love with iOS and don't mind iOS7, then stick with iPhone and get the 5s. The camera isn't as great as the Lumia 1020, but for the casual user you won't notice the difference.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera with attached phone.", "Author": "cl_sagacious", "ReviewID": "R3KGH0JO6FAXF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "41 megapixels!!! That is the selling feature of this phone. Everything relating to the camera is fantastic! Low light? No problem! Fast moving subject? Change settings and a perfect picture! The camera is phenomenal. There is no question about that. Unfortunately, that's about where the glamour ends.Rather than doing a long paragraph, I will do key points.PROS:camera!!!good battery life (only charge once every day to day and a half)great signal strength - I have better coverage and can make calls in places that are on the edge of service (however see con below)clear speakerphoneCONS:dicey call quality - completely hit and miss, no matter the signal or who I call. Sounds garbled about half the timeno memory car slot - 41 megapixel pics take up a lot of space and free space is somewhere around 27-28 gb because of the operating systemwindows - I had one of the first windows phones and actually liked it. After having an android, I find the windows store not to be up to par. Lack of free apps or ones use is disappointing.no removable battery - I didn't think this would be an issue until I have tried to disconnect calls and had the phone freeze. It eventually unfreezes after about 5-10 seconds, but that seems like a long time when you're trying to hang up.Overall, I think it's an ok phone with an amazing camera. I really wanted it to be the perfect phone but sadly it falls short. But, if you don't mind the imperfections, the camera really does almost make up for the lackluster phone portion.On a side note, I love windows 8 on my computer, so this isn't an anti-microsoft review.

I have had at least one of all the major phones at one time or another. iPhone, Blackberry, Android. I rely on my cell for work and use it a lot, especially OneNote. This is my first Windows phone. I was hoping for a lot more from a phone with the big screen, a monster camera and Windows 8.0.The camera, at 41 megapixels, sounds impressive but in truth it is pretty bad. I am a photographer and have a number of cameras at home, and even one of my older Canon 10 MP SLR's takes a much better photo than this Lumia does. You can't even compare the two. In my opinion, the best cell camera on the market was the Blackberry Torch (5 MP). The image quality there was amazing. The microphone on this cell is of poor quality as well. Nothing like the iPhone 5s. I always have people asking me to repeat myself. I have tried repositioning the phone when I talk and it doesn't make much of a difference. It also doesn't have call blocking like the iPhone has on the Rogers network. Apparently this is a Nokia issue though. They have not provided the software for this feature yet. Also, in trying to make this phone Dummy-proof, Nokia & Windows have not put in many advanced setting controls. It makes advanced set-up of emails, network setting somewhat difficult. The phone does not offer the same set-up options that the iPhone 5 does. One smaller issue is the alert tones. You cannot add customized tones for your email or SMS.Over-all, I am not happy with this purchase. Because of the price of the phone and because this is not Nokia's first cell-phone, I thought it would be much further along in development than it actually is. I'm just waiting to find one more issue with this phone and I will be reconnecting my iPhone 5.Swing and a miss Nokia. You wanted to build a Ferrari but forgot to put an engine in it.**UPDATE Jan 23, 2014 - Well, that didn't take long.  Have you ever tried to make a playlist on this thing.  What a train wreck.

So I tested the camera and little by little, those yellow-tinted problems have gone away so \"CHEERS\" Nokia and Microsoft, I apologies if I gave it a 1/5 star on my rating because its frustrating at first but I changed it recently thanks to that recently released black update. Now and forever I'm a Nokia fan and a Microsoft product user, I'm still testing the phone so I only gave it a 4/5 stars for now and might comeback again in a few days to test out the black update on the Lumia 1020. Who knows, I might give it a complete 5/5 star rating. Keep up the good work Microsoft and Nokia! Thanks so much.------- IGNORE MY REVIEW BELOW ----------- FOR NOWI recently have something of a problem in taking photos! All of my pictures have a yellow-tint that mixes with the white color... and in the commercials they always say its the best camera, shame on you NOKIA! I have a lot of respect before, and even bought 2 of your flagship phones, its your fault this issue was hidden to the masses...  BEWARE, IT DESTROYS YOUR PICTURE AND MIXES YELLOW-TINT during post processing of the photo... regardless whether or not with flash or not! SHAME! SHAME!
