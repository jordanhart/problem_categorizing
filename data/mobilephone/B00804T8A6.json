{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent call quality", "Author": "Keith H.", "ReviewID": "RKSMJGPPAONT5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have tried a lot of Verizon phones over the past few months and the call quality of the smart phones was so disappointing that I refused to purchase one. I bought the Gusto 2 in desperation based on one positive CNET review. Call quality when listening at low to medium volume levels is good.  At higher volume levels callers become harder to understand.  Spoken sound quality is very good. When my wife calls our land line with the Gusto 2, I cannot tell that she is on a cell phone. I also love the talking caller ID and talking text message feature. The phone will read the entire text message to me, (great when driving).  As far as reception goes, my house is in a fringe area and Verizon service has always been spotty for me.  This phone seems to have pretty good RF sensitivity and I have not had any dropped calls in our home. Compared to other phones I have owned it is better than average with handling weak signals.Build quality of the phone is a mixed bag of good and bad features. Parts of it are flimsy and feel toy like and other parts of it are quite strong. The battery cover is very thin and the slightest drop will knock it loose and send the battery flying. I don't expect the cover to take too many drops.  The hinge and frame of the phone is strong and rigid.  The keyboard has a budget feel to it but works  well.  Some type of thin rubber like material has been applied to the front and back of the phone so that it is easier to grip.  It feels good in the hand and stops the phone from sliding around on slippery surfaces.Screen resolution is the worst I have ever seen. It is so grainy that it makes the unlimited mobile web browsing feature of the $50.00 prepaid plan very frustrating to use at times.  Poor camera. Menu screens are not intuitive and finding things is a chore. Ringer volume is not as loud to me as the last version of this phone.  It is typical of it's class but I can't hear it ring in my factory. (At work I could hear the ringer on other phones I have owned). I would pay more for an improved version of this phone.The struggle to hear and be heard in a cell to cell voice conversation is  tiring.  It's also very distracting and makes driving and talking even more dangerous than it already is.  The Gusto 2 has great call quality. With this phone I can relax and enjoy the conversation.  In spite of it's problems I am pleased overall and would buy it again.  Hopefully the voice technology that Samsung used in this phone will trickle up to the smart phones.My comments about voice quality referred to how well this phone sounded on both sides of a conversation with one of the parties being on a quality land line or cell to cell within the Verizon network. When I call people on other networks sound quality drops off a bit.March 9th 2014 update.  I finally broke it, (my mistake).  Went and got another one.  They still have great voice quality!  The call quality is actually a good bit better than my Moto G.On a side note....sometimes my wife has issues with the Gusto.  If she holds it just right the skin covering her outer ear will block the earpiece and the sound drops out.  She thinks she has dropped the call or the phone has messed up but all it requires is a slight re-positioning of her hand.Still recommended.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Way better than the Original Samsung Gusto!!", "Author": "Geekmaster92", "ReviewID": "R3P2U5DG0H8TNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the Samsung Gusto... the First one, and it is about to bite the dust.

And not in a good way.", "Author": "Hitchner Gitalong", "ReviewID": "R37KLJIWQFG778", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Sometimes I think the cellular providers really have it in for those of us who don't want smartphones with all their bells and whistles, and are unleashing products like the Gusto 2 upon us in an attempt to irritate us into upgrading.I'm a longtime Verizon customer, happy with the coverage (I live in the sticks), and I have been using their LG flip phones for years with no problems. Recently the keypad on my LG Accolade started giving me trouble, and it was time for a new phone anyway, so off I went to the Verizon store. The sales rep took a look at my usage history, saw that I hardly used any minutes, and recommended switching to a prepaid plan to save money. Sounded fine to me. The current LG flip model, the Revere 2, was substantially more expensive than the Gusto 2, so I went with the latter. More fool me.The Gusto 2 is like your white-trash cousin: kinda big, kinda coarse, low-rent sense of aesthetics, and you kinda hope it's not around when your friends come to visit. It has a cheap, flimsy feel to it. It does not seem to close securely. The ringtones seem designed to be especially lame, and the low-res screen makes every text message look like something out of an old Mario Bros. game. Thanks to the protruding buttons on the side of the phone, I'm always accidentally turning on the camera or the speakerphone whenever I pick the phone up. Really, is there ANY excuse for this sort of shoddy design nowadays? No. There isn't.The one good thing about the Gusto 2 is the call quality: I've had no problems with that. And...that's it. I'll have that much good to say about this phone when I return it to the Verizon store.This phone feels like an afterthought on Samsung's part, as if they looked down their nose at those of us who don't want a smartphone and said, \"Oh, you just want something *basic*, do you? How quaint. Well...we'll see what we can throw together\" and then produced a phone that could have come from an arcade claw machine.

Read the description of how you are charged for your minutes; very misleading.  You'll see what I mean if you then go and read the FAQs.After getting the phone and opening the package, the true details of the fees comes to light.  You have to buy minutes for the phone before you use it, which is not a problem.  But, you have to buy a minimum of $15 worth of minutes when you buy them AND the minutes expire every 30 days.  That's not pay as you go!!!  I bought this phone to use for emergencies at home, replacing my land line which was never used.  AND, if you don't renew you minutes timely, you pay a penalty.  WTH?

I rarely go over 600 minutes a month so I'm paying more.  The Samsung Verizon pre paid phone is just a better phone than the Motorola Straight Talk phone.  So in the long run I guess I'm better off.

Battery life is good, call quality is good, available minutes displays on the phone.  Worked on an out of state school trip with no roaming charges.  Never drops calls in our area.  If the teenager who is using it loses the thing, the $25 cost will be much less trouble than more expensive phones.  Our average use level is probably 3-4 calls per week plus 4 or 5 texts per week, if that.  For much heavier use, the verizon pre-paid plan is probably not cost competitive.  For a $25, it was a great value for a basic communication device.  Will not call back up to the Enterprise to get beamed aboard when on foreign planets, but hey, it's $25, and costs us about $10 / month.  Verizon's website was tricky at first as it seemed to be hiding the lower cost options for pre-purchasing minutes.  Watch the time till expiration of the minutes, the minimum purchase expires in 30 days.  Availability of the less costly options seemed to be buried a bit on the website, which kept trying to direct me to more expensive phone plans.  Once set up the phone has been zero hassle.  Very pleased for the use described. Teenager is able to call or text but is uninterested in using it as a toy.

We don't text, so we don't care about that. These phones have some smartphone features, but we don't care about those either. All we want is a way to communicate with each other, when one is traveling to work and an emergency occurs.We got these phones at Family Dollar for $20.00 each. Sometimes you can catch them on sale, either for $15.00, or $20.00 and you get a Family Dollar store coupon for $10.00.We have had them since July 1, and so far I have added $15.00 to each phone (the minimum amount) and so far we are pleased. There are many plans you can sign up for, but we have the $1.99 plan. That is a daily charge of $1.99 per day for unlimited calls and text. However, if you do not use your phone, either dial out or answer an incoming call, you are not charged that day. Any extras like photos (it is a camera phone) are $.25 per picture, and webbing, email, etc, cost extra.Verizon's website is easy to use also, and you can track your daily usage. It is much easier than we ever found with Boost.The phones themselves seem sturdy and feel good to the hand. Also for those of us age 60 or better, it is easy to read the screen and keypad without glasses in many cases. Sound in the earpiece is good, whereas with other phones, it has been hard to hear the other end of the conversation--or have them hear you.I didn't plan on writing a review here, but I guess I just did.

It keeps functioning! It does seem to be made of some \"cheap\" budget feel plastic, but, whatever works, right? what do you expect? you get what you pay for. The display screen seems much more large than my old phone. (this may be important to you, if you like internet). I do not have a lot of experience with the internet, but it was not slow! The texting of photos was so incredibly slow, it was just archaic! It seemed to take one or two minutes to text pics?! I live in the city, so, I dont' understand this issue. The SAR rating is very very low 0.29 compared to Apple and other popular phones at 1.2. Perhaps, this affects the speed? I don't really know,but I am curious! One complaint, is when I want to check the time, I either must flip open the phone, or push and HOLD the outer buttons for one to two seconds. Personally, I find that somewhat annoying. The most annoying feature is the fact that my very old ancient Verizon phone (from Verizon website) would hold over 500 photos in the memory! My Samsung Gusto does not have much memory at all. It only seems to hold about 70 photos? I called Verizon about this issue. I said \"is my phone defective? it only holds 70 photos? why is that?\" the only answer they seemed to come up with is that you can take your phone to any big box store and print photos? Verizon is grandfathering out the old Pix place website where you could DL to your computer. (It would cost .25 per upload. I miss this feature. but I don't think anyone else was even aware of this..... or $1 per day to upload photos directly to web). Oh. And you can DL apps and stuff (of course!). it even comes with a creepy FREE APP of daily celebrity news???! (Verizon did help  me to delete this, but it puts an error message on my phone when I open it once per day. how odd.)  I find the FREE APP to be very creepy. Verizon wants to know what I am interested in reading News? or it wants to entice me to click to learn more and use internet time and $ perhaps? OH! And I've only used this phone about once to talk. I did not experience any issues with clarity. It seemed plenty loud enough. I don't hear it much on vibrate, but I assume that's my fault. I have never really recieved any calls with the ringer on, so I don't know how loud it is. I live in the city. Sometimes, I walk to University on busy streets.I should test this feature for you. but the phone is only for emergencies. to call AAA or My dad for repairing a flat tire (instead of 911). OK. Thank you for your time. I hope this review helps! OH! and I keep trying to touch the screen when the internet is on, to click to the next link. That's Hilarous! This is not a touch screen! ha ha!PS.

The phone came as expected, I ripped the s*** out of the environmentally unfriendly indestructible plastic case, and went to town with it.When I got to the \"activate\" part, I was forwarded to a very delightful person at VZ customer service who quickly identified that the phone was in some sort of lock status.  I didn't listen to all the crazy blah, but the short of it was that the seller did not properly release the phone to be activated by Verizon.  This is protection in case I had stolen the phone.  Understood, but suck.I called Amazon to learn that the only option I had was to return the phone, get a refund, and try again.  I understand Amazon's policy, as much as it sucks for me, but asked if there was a way to reach the seller and find out if they could \"remove the lock\" on the phone.  This would've made my life so much easier (and would've resolved the problem immediately), but the seller had no customer service number on file that could be reached.  So, I started the return process, shipped a phone that can not be easily resold (since I hacked the living daylights out of that packaging), and I went directly to Verizon.I will continue to business with Verizon, but I suspect that \"Wireless Wholesale Corp\" will not get any more of my business.

I e-mailed amazon customer service asking them to make sure this phone would work over there because that is the sole reason why I'm buying it. They e-mailed me back within 24hrs saying yes it does and sorry about the incomplete information on the phone's webpage. So then I called Verizon to double check. They also said yes it will work in the Netherlands. I get the phone and what should have been an easy activation (only 5 steps long) turned out taking 2 hours and 5 different Verizon wireless people transferring me back and forth to just turn on and activate the phone. I did try it here in the States,and it did work here. So I get all the way over to the Netherlands and tried to use it and of course it didn't work! There wasn't even a signal or searching for signal sign; it would turn on and that's it. It didn't even display the clock anymore and I couldn't even use it for an alarm clock.
