I love the function of the PDA and this is the only smartphone that have the option of not paying for Data services if no web browsing is chosen at Verizon.  This phone is small yet includes a lot of smartphone features.  Certainly, the screen is way too small for browsing the web anyway!  My old palm sometime cannot be shut off or turn on.  So, I order a spare just in case.  The phone arrived in good condition with earphone and car charger (better than the one I am using.) However, unlike my original one, there were no disk (software) for synchronizing with the computer for backup.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Ron Viereck", "ReviewID": "R34ZNGB7UHZ91X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Palm Centro smartphone from PromoCell through Amazon.com to replace my current Palm Centro when it eventually wears out.  I got my current one about 3 years ago from Verizon Wireless, and it is starting to show some significant wear (the Power/End button is cracked).  I have information (Calendar/Date Book, Contacts/Address book, Memos, documents, etc.) stored on it dating back to 1997 when I bought a Palm III PDA, and the newer Palm smartphones such as Pre 3, Veer and Pixi Plus have a different operating system and cannot store my data.  This new Palm Centro that I bought through Amazon.com is very inexpensive and is brand new--it is identical to the one I got from Verizon.  I tested it, including synchronizing with Palm Desktop 6.2.2 on my computer, and it works perfectly.  I will put it to use when my first one eventually goes out.  It does not do everything that the iPhone, for example, does with all the apps available, but I don't need all that.  As far as I'm concerned, the only negative is the small keyboard.  Also, longer battery life before recharging would be nice, but it is no big deal to recharge each day.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Everything that was promised", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R3R1PUI65MP0UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Palm Centro to replace a Centro that I beat up pretty bad.

It came 6 days before it was expected. I was shocked, because usaully when I order a product on amazon it arrives on the last expected day.
