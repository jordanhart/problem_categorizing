{"Reviews": [{"Title": "CHEAPEST CONTRACT EVER + VERY GOOD PHONE", "Author": "Yasin Cakal \"whoisyasin\"", "ReviewID": "R1WQK82WYSM6PX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off let me tell you that I switched from an iPhone 4 to this phone! Why would I do such a thing? Well, because I am sick and tired of paying so much for a phone contract. ATT charged me $40 for 450min, $25 for 2gb of web, $20 for unlimited texting= $85. But somehow that number always ends up over $100 because of bunch of taxes and fees (and I don't go over my minutes ever). Let's see, VM charges me $25+$2tax for 300 minutes, unlimited web+text. Well, I need unlimited web, because I use pandora radio all day long, so the 2gb limit on ATT wasn't cutting it for me. So I am saving over $80 a month, meaning this phone pays it self off in 3 months. That is the contract part. So, this is the number 1 reason you should buy this phone, FOR SAVING MONEY!!! $80 of savings per month X 24 months (which is the contract you would sign with any carrier out there) is $1820. I don't care how rich you are, I am sure you can use an extra $2K.Now let me review the phone. To all you android fan boys out there, google limits what you can do with your phone just like apple, but I will agree not as much. Just as I had to jailbreak my iPhone, I had to \"root\" this phone, to allow such things as tethering. Just check out the app store to see how many \"Root Only\" apps there are out there to validate my point. The 3G is noticeably slower than ATTs but it is much faster than edge, so it will do. The phone isn't as user friendly or as fast as an iPhone 4, but it is much more customizable. And yes this phone can be rooted. The phone runs os 2.1 but, sprint will have 2.2 so even if VM doesn't update, someone out there will make this possible. Overall the phone is great, and does everything that I want it to do. I'm old school with texting, so I love the fact that it has a keyboard, The battery life isn't too bad, probably because the phone is bulky. Camera on this isn't all that, so don't expect to take breath taking photos. Touch screen and buttons are very responsive, so that's a good thing.Overall, in my opinion, this is not THE iPhone, or Droid X, but it comes dangerously close. And for $25 a month, you can't go wrong. If you love the iPhone, and can't give it up, I'd say, do it, and get urself a iPod Touch with this phone. And if 300 minutes are a problem, you can always use skype or get 1200 for $15 more. This is not an A+ smartphone, and VM is not an A+ carrier, but the value is UNBEATABLE!!! And as a student, I am willing to sacrifice the unnoticeably small shortcomings for very noticeable amount of savings.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome if you can get it going!", "Author": "Kiboko", "ReviewID": "R3G5PI5Y229LS7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I hate to spend money. I've been using the same old Nokia with T-Mobile TOGO for several years ($.10/minute). So when I saw that Virgin Mobile was offering a smartphone for $25/month I thought it was too good to be true. Researching various other websites I saw that the biggest drawback to Virgin Mobile was bad customer service. When the price of the Samsung Intercept dropped from $250 to $175 on the Virgin Mobile website I figured that was a price I was willing to gamble with.PURCHASE: I ordered the phone on Dec 14 and due to snow in the area it didn't arrive until Dec 18 (can't complain about free fedex). I was able to activate it (mostly) that night using the internet (note that it says you have to charge the phone for 2hrs minimum before use) and was soon downloading freeware to fill up my multiple screens. To activate the phone I decided to bypass the credit card option (I had read multiple accounts of \"accidental\" double-billing) and chose to use 'fill-up' cards that you can usually find discounted on the web (i.e. instead of $25/month I'll be paying $23 by using callingmart and other websites).PROBLEM: The problem occured when I tried to make an actual call. I was able to text/web-search and everything else just fine. I was not able to make a normal phone call and the voice on the phone said I was out of minutes. Fortunately when it tells you you have no minutes it asks if you would like to add minutes. I said \"yes.\" It asked me how I would like to add minutes and I said \"operator\" only to find that Virgin Mobile's customer service is only open from 4AM to 7PM Pacific time. I called the next morning and was told by their Indian bureau that their computers were not functioning and to call again in 2hrs. I called 2hrs later and got their Filipino bureau and was told to remove the battery for 2 minutes, and then try the phone, and if that did not work then to try it again in 1 hr. 1hr later still no phone! I called again and got Mary in the Filipino bureau. I explained the problem and within minutes she had reset my phone and got it working.CONCLUSION: The moral of the story is that it's a great phone. You might have to jump through hoops to get it working, but the customer service is polite enough and you apparently just have to keep at it until you find the few knowledgeable techies over there. The phone does consume a lot of batterie life (I might have to look into different apps to work on this) - after playing with it for about 3-4hrs I was down to 60% battery power. The phone might look and feel plasticky, but it still seems solid enough. The slide out keyboard is awesome since I hate using the touchscreens on my friends' iPhones. The phone is very easy to work out and for more in depth explanations of icons and functions there is a manual on Virgin Mobile's website. If you were using an old 'candy-bar' phone like I was or (heaven forbid) a monochromatic phone, this is the one to upgrade with!UPDATE: A friend of mine successful loaded GooglePhone which allows him unlimited phone minutes with this phone in the US - Therefore you can have unlimited Data/Texting/Internet/Phone for ~$25/month (the closest thing to this is Cricket, and they want $40/month!)", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not cutting edge, but the BEST VALUE you will find.", "Author": "S.

It is comparable to the first generation mainstream Android Phones, such as the Motorola Droid, HTC Nexus One, and others.  It does not perform as well as the cutting edge Android 2.2 phones like the Droid X, Droid 2, Samsung Galaxy, etcetera.The key to this phone is that you get all the features that you really need for $250 upfront, $25 a month, and no contract.  Assuming you use this phone for more than about 8 months, you will save a ton of money over a contract phone.  At $25 for unlimited data, unlimited text, and 300 minutes of voice you will save about $75 a month for every month that you use this phone instead of a contract phone.I strongly recommend this phone, or any of Virgin Mobile's others that are on their Beyond Talk or Broadband Unlimited plans.

Sprint (Virgin's Parent Company) announced last week that the Motorola Triumph would be coming to Virgin Mobile on the Beyond Talk plans.  This looks to be a great phone, that is similar to the first generation Motorola Droid, but without a keyboard.

My first smart phone was the Virgin Mobile Blackberry 8530 and this Intercept WAS a step up. So at first I really liked it. Not knowing anything better, I dealt with the cons listed above.Patience was needed to dial phone numbers since it had a lag just to bring up the dialer or a contact.When using the GPS with Google Navigation, the whole thing often just froze up and even had to take the battery out then put it in and power back up. Very frustrating when trying to get somewhere you've never been before or if you are in a rush or both.The home screen was a real pain since it ALWAYS would first show up with no icons. Wait about 3 or 4 seconds and then it becomes useable. Again, for dialing, this added more time just to make a call.Yes there are a few noteworthy features mentioned in my Pros, but none are worthy enough to justify another star added to my rating since this device does not function well enough just as a phone.In an emergency situation this phone could waste the important few seconds that could mean the difference between life and death.I've just replaced this Intercept with an LG Optimus since my dog decided to chomp on the Intercept. Only now do I realize what I was missing.

Dude \"JFranco\"", "ReviewID": "R331UYN0HIIF37", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OverallThis phone is one of the best phones I've owned. I've used a few Android-powered devices before such as the G1, HTC Hero, Kyocera Zio, Motorola Droid, and the Huawei Ascend. This phone compares nicely to them. It runs 2.1 with 2.2 update in the near future. It runs pretty smoothly. The 3.2MP camera takes wonderful pictures. The data on this phone isn't the fastest but it is definately not slow. It has stock Android so there is no TouchWiz. It does not support Live Wallpaper, nor does it support Flash. The screen resolution isn't the best but the screen is vibrant. The keyboard is durable and firm. I went from paying $50+ a month to $25. This phone is perfect for social networking.On AndroidIt has stock Android 2.1 Eclair. The phone has a few VM links, such as \"Activate\", \"My Account\", \"Downloads\", and \"Virgin Mobile Live\". It also has Youtube, Facebook, AirG Chat, Alarm Clock, Amazon MP3, Maps, Market, Navigation, Talk (GoogleTalk), and ThinkFree Office mobile suite. On default there are 3 home screens. The transition is smooth. On occassion (usually when there are too many apps in the background) the screen may lag a bit.I have GDE so I have a total of 6 screens, with a CUBE like transition. The default messaging app needs a little work. I use Handcent, it allows signitures and pattern-lock screens. To make sure the phone doesn't slow down, I use Advanced Task Killer to kill background task. Pandora streams pretty well on both WiFi and EVDO.It uses Sprint's Nationwide Coverage, I went to Denver a few days ago and it worked seamlessly.If you are a first time Android User, I definately recommend this phone.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Virgin Mobile Samsung Intercept", "Author": "faterewardsthedaring", "ReviewID": "RGY57MQF4JOJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Intercept is a decent Android phone. While it may not be on par with the iPhone and other Android phones in terms of features and performance. It gives them a bloody nose in terms of economics. I have been using my Intercept for almost a month now do not regret it the slightest. It is no iPhone but does everything I want with no issue. The data is speed is pretty robust and call quality is good.Initially I wanted the iPhone but I couldn't justify the overall cost. Considering $199 for the phone and almost $90 per a month for 2 years I couldn't justify. I love the iPhone OS but I didn't care for 2gb bandwidth cap and over priced phone service. After spending 249.99 on the phone and choosing the $40 a month plan. I do not have one shred of buyers remorse. I plan on getting 2-3 years our of this phone. Comparing to what other Android phones will run long term its a intelligent purchase. After all my favorite feature of the phone is the small monthly cost and no contract.Feature wise the phone works well. Everything works as advertise. My only recommendation is buy a protect case such as the rubberize one from Body Glove and the micro sd card for your media. And spend some time researching all things Android to get the most out of your phone.For another perspective check out this comparison of the Virgin Mobile Intercept and Droid X[...]", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Slow, Buggy, Bad", "Author": "Me", "ReviewID": "R21KPWA2NQYLV8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Most of the reviews for this phone are talking about how great the plans that come with it are; sure the plans are good, but the phone itself is terrible so buy a different Virgin Mobile device. I've had this phone for about a year now, so heres my experience with it:I'll talk about my experience with Virgin Mobile and this phone since thats also relevant.Pros of Virgin Mobile1-Sprint network-pretty fast, decent coverage (not at my house).2-Cheap plans (though they've bumped up the cost $10 recently, they're still a lot cheaper)Cons of Virgin Mobile1-Customer service is TERRIBLE. I spoke with them for 2 months because my phone may have been defective (it kept randomly playing music even when i turned it off and wouldn't stop until i removed the battery) and got nothing from them at all just a bunch of rude individuals asking me to \"hold down the end key until the phone turns off. They would cancel my ticket every 72 hours so I'd have to explain the issue to a new representative. Now hold down the end key again until it turns on\" I requested a replacement daily for about two weeks until they agreed. THEN i demanded a new phone rather than a refurbished phone. I was promised the phone would be new. Then when they sent the phone, i called them again to confirm it was new-they promised. I opened the phone to find a badly cracked and scratched phone which i promptly placed in the box and sent back. Then about 2 weeks later i started getting threatening emails/texts/calls from Virgin demanding that i return my phone. They canceled my service. I called them telling them that I had sent the phone back in the prepaid envelope provided and they asked me for my tracking number which i obviously didn't record. I threatened legal action until they said \"oh ok I guess we did get your phone\" and stopped communicating with me-pretending my problem had been solved (it hadn't). Then Virgin refused all communications with me for another 3 months.  So here I am, with a defective phone. If you want Virgin mobile you really, really can't have a single problem.Problems with the phone1-it is really really really slow and lags behind frequently. This phone really can't compete with decent android phones of 3 almost 4 years ago.2-Editing contacts frequently results in the phone crashing. I can't edit contacts anymore, i have to go on my computer to edit them online.3-the screen is pretty small and low resolution.4-Sending texts is frequently impossible because i can't enter the contact's name into the To field-it just puts a comma between every letter.5-the phone is pretty heavy and thick compared to modern phones.6-the phone is so slow that using the android unlock screen is impossible because it can't track the finger movements.7-it constantly loses the 3g/2g data connection such that i have to restart the phone (a 4 minute process)Really honestly, just don't purchase this phone. ANY other phone would be able to perform basic functions-the lesser Virgin Mobile phones would be better. The Intercept is an insult to the android OS.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Intercept on Virgin Mobile - not freaking bad", "Author": "sad.robot \"kneeL\"", "ReviewID": "R11XAGDO5T5YMD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Voice dialing doesnt work through Bluetooth.Voice Dialing regularly just emits these weird high pitched sounds out of the speaker and doesn't work or \"listen\".\"Downloads\" link doesn't work, (the Virgin Mobile Downloads not the Android Market) and it says once it opens to close ti and open the Browser and download the first link entitled \"downloads update\" to update the Downloads app.  Well there is no such link on the browser, I cannot find it anywhere in Virgin Mobiles downloads section.  Their website sucks ass and doesn't work half the time.So no downloads which I was looking for the Contact Vault App I paid $1 a month for so I could get my 150 contacts transferred to my phone.No go because of the downloads update issue not working.Besides that its pretty damn bad ass.  3G is surprisingly fast for Virgin Mobile even though I know its on Sprint's network.If you work at a place you cannot get your Network Security/MS Exchange/Windows administrators to allow PUSH service through OWA in their exchange or add you to the group so you can do it, you can still get your corporate email!  Use RoadSync from the Android Market.  It somehow bypasses the security settings that block you from accessing it.  Thankfully I did not need it as i got the approvals needed.  it is free for 14 days and then if you want to keep it, its $9.99.No Flash on camera. Weak. ALso that means no DroidLight flashlight, only the LCD screen flashlight.The GOOD thing about this phone is I see no Security settings to use a PIN number to lock the phone, only the Pattern-thing which is fine.  but when you enable corporate mail in many jobs, they force the phone to loack and you have to set a PIN and ALWAYS enter it anytime the screen shuts off (every 10 seconds).. but with this one I guess they dont have that feature so they cant force it!  I love not having to do that.Anyway good phone.The reason its a lower-end android is the newer big ones have huge 4\"+ screens, 8MP cameras, 1000Mhz processors.Whereas the Intercept has only a 3.2\" screen or so, 3.2MP camera, and 800mhz qualcomm processor, and less ram.I have found even the best iPhones and Androids still tend to lag a bit with all the apps and wifi and GPS stuff going on all the time, but you can expect this phone and others in its level, to be a tad slower than that even.  Mine is mostly responsive, only lags behind sometimes, but i have noticed apps/games like Anrgy Birds, runs super slow because I guess the phone isnt powerful enough.  but really for the ability to browse, use some apps, but mostly for phone/text/email and calander, its great!  Not sure how to find contacts in my Corporate address book though,Also since gmail has been adding every number and email to my contacts for years and years, I have 1000 contacts to go through and delete, that got synced to my phone.  If you are worried about contact syncing and plan to use Android just get all your contacts updated and organized in your Gmail account and they will goto the phone.I exported them from Virgin Mobiles Contact Vault page on their website, and then edited the .csv file to make it the correct format, and then imported into google.

I have been waiting for a smartphone from VM for a long time (what I wouldn't give for a VM iPhone!).I do like having all of those great android apps on the go, and I didn't even know that the phone has GPS, which is a great feature. The problems are as mentioned in several of the other low star reviews.First of all, the phone is often so slow, that it doesn't even register hitting a button for a LONG time - sometimes the phone is too slow to answer a call! It can make you hit a button just because you think that the hit didn't register the first time (also a problem), and then the phone catches up and does something unexpected due to a button you didn't know you hit.  The unresponsiveness and slow speed of the phone is the worst problem.Second of all, the phone is buggy - the first symptom is that the notification window stops working after a few hours.  I have to reboot the phone at least once a day, and THAT takes forever - longer than some slow PCs!  I have had the phone crash, when I am just trying to answer it.Thirdly, the VM Samsung Intercept is probably the only android phone that has not been upgraded to Android 2.2 (froyo).  This means that lots of bug fixes/features are not yet available, and worse, YOU CAN'T MOVE APPS TO THE SD CARD!  This means that you can only install a limited number of apps, and the phone runs out of (internal) memory/storage very quickly.I still like the promise of the phone, and I am hoping that the android 2.2 update will fix a lot of these problems (supposedly, the update might get released next month?).

The most impressive feature out of the box is the incredible call quality. My brother called me as he was walking down a very busy street with cars driving by and it sounded like he was speaking to me from a library--the phone is excellent at canceling out background noise. The biggest con in my opinion: the battery life. If you get this out of the box, send some text messages throughout the day and surf the web for a little while, then you're going to have to charge it every night. My LG Rumor Touch was able to do what this phone does everyday and only needed charging about every 4 days. The best way to remedy this is to download the NetQin Mobile Guard app which manages your battery, gives you the option to turn on and off WiFi and GPRS (which isn't necessary if you're not transmitting data) and allows you to instantly kill background apps that aren't essential (such as Amazon MP3, Browser and other stock apps that have a nasty habit of opening themselves up constantly). Doing this should increase your battery at least 20% by the end of the day.There are a ton of apps that make this phone fun. Angry Birds is incredibly addictive, but if you're looking for a gaming phone, then Android--specifically this Android--just isn't for you. The games available on the Android Market are pretty sub-par and the good 3D games really aren't cut out for this device as those are geared more towards the powerful Droids that are provided by the major carriers and the new tablets that run on Android. However, PopCap has recently stated that an Android version of Plants VS Zombies should be out within the next few months so that's something to look forward to! The absolute best app for me has got to be Skyfire which is an Internet browser that allows you to watch a lot of Flash content that's available on the web. Over Virgin Mobile's network--without the assistance of WiFi--I've been able to watch full episodes of South Park from their official website and some episodes of Family Guy from one of those \"watch family guy x.com\" websites. The video quality is excellent and I mean EXCELLENT; I was very impressed and the loading times are very fast; a full episode of South Park loads in about 10 seconds and it never stops to buffer. However, depending on the site, you won't get an option to pause; South Park Studios .com is one of those but I'm confident that the developers are working to resolve this issue. Sorry, hulu doesn't work on Skyfire.Youtube was another major factor in my decision to get this phone. The LG Rumor touch supported Youtube but the video quality was terrible and it cut in and out constantly. Without the support of WiFi the quality isn't improved with this phone, however you've got the option to up the quality while not on WiFi but this results in lots of buffering and loading times but it does get the job done. When you're on WiFi, this can easily handle watching Youtube videos in extremely clear quality with next to no loading time. It's quality over VM's network obviously has to do with the fact that you're paying an extremely low rate for service so I don't really count this against Virgin Mobile.The network works rather decently. A few weeks ago I went to Arizona by way of the 40 freeway from Los Angeles. The cell service cut out occasionally because it's pretty desolate most of the way but my girlfriend's phone barely got any service, but it did for the most part, the entire way (she's got Verizon). At the Grand Canyon, forget it, it's a complete dead zone. The phone does have an issue with bogging down and running slow, but if you're good on managing running apps then you shouldn't have too much of a problem, however it did completely crash on my once. Another issue I have is that this phone takes about a full 2 minutes to boot up.Bottom line is that it's a great introductory Smart Phone and Virgin Mobile's rates can't be beat. I pay $25 for unlimited messaging, data and 300 minutes, but I rarely use that many. If you're a bigger talker, then there is a $40 plan for 1200 minutes and a $60 for unlimited everything. Also for consideration, if you have Skype, there is a Skype app so you can probably use that in place of spending more for more airtime minutes. So if you want real apps, an affordable non-contract Smart Phone, an EXCELLENT GPS device backed by the every growing support of Google and an expanding marketplace then this is the phone for you.

My T-mobile bill keeps getting higher and higher, and someone told me V.M finally had plans that included unlimited internet. Well guess what, all of there plans alos include unlimited texting. And the internet on this phone is the real internet. Not a modified mobile version. An explorere is clearly there, where you can type whatever site you want. You don't have some mobile browser where you have to tabe to a blank field, or go to pre designated icons. Opera mobile is also available. There are a few pre set apps that leads to sites, but you can also type the site and get the full version. You can do everything on Facebook from this phone, as you can on a laptop, not just change you status and upload a photo. I can go to Wells Fargo's ral website, not just WF mobile. The internet is faster than that on my Windows Mobile smartphone, and wifi is just an added bonus. One of the best features is Google Maps. There is a real navigator at that site, which is free unlike T-mobile's Telenav, or the regular Google maps which has GPS, but doesn't navigate. Actually, the newer Virgin phones are great. The LG Rumor Touch is also sufficient, but ths phone's internet is better, and the navigation feature on Google maps is a great bonus that shows pictures of your destination like google maps does on he computer. Text messaging is clear and un-complicated, yet you can just touch a message or picture, and instantly copy or forward its contents like you can on the Motorota Cliq, without accidently dragging it to the wrong site or message. The camera is clear, conscise, and easy to use. The music player works like an mp3 player, not just a phone that plays music. I love the fact that there is a 3.5 jack in addition to the charging port, so you can do 2 thinks at one time. There is an Andoid app store with lots of free apps, and Best Buy sells accesories for the phone (look for Sprint's Intercept accesories). And, the phone can be tethered to use on your laptop, which was the only reason why I kept buying Windows Mobile phones (you cannot tether Virgin's Blackberry, like you can the blackberry on contact phones. There may be a way to root it, but not by just plugging in the cord and sharing). The bummer is you have to download the tethering sofware of the phone and the laptop (as opposed to just going to internet sharing in the programs), but it is very easy and quik, and it doesn't appear that you are changing the dynamics of the phone. The only thing that I personally do not care for is the keyboard. The keys are flat and not raised, or clearly  seperated, which means you have to sort of look down at the keys when texting, as opposed to just feeling them. For instance, the whole qwerty is smooth, like the keypad of a dell or hp netbook. I like more defined keys. The LG rumor touch2 has an excellent keyboard and is $100 cheaper. My husband got that when he switched from Metro, and I swictched to this one from T-mobile. If you don't need wi-fi or tethering, The Runor Touch2is great. If you wanna look and feel like you have a smart phone, this phone is great. It cost $250 at Best Buy, and has been on sale lately for $200 at Radio Shack. The calender is great and links up all of your appointments. And the monthly price. $60 gives you unlimited everything without having to get a \"Ghettro\".

Francis", "ReviewID": "R33HTCCF4KSUET", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone shortly after it came out in November 2010.  I was really excited for an Android phone on Virgin Mobile, but my excitement quickly wore off and this has not been a pleasant year together.Problems arose from the moment I unpacked the Samsung Intercept.  After getting it setup, I called a friend to test the voice quality (as this was my first Virgin Mobile phone, and first CDMA phone).  Unfortunately, he couldn't hear me.  After making several more calls, and doing a hard reset, I realized the mic was faulty.  So I called VM for a replacement.The second one I received performs about as well as one can expect this phone to.  It's innards appear to struggle with the complexity of Android OS.  It's slow, and often freezes or suffers (rather I suffer) long pauses opening, switching between, or closing applications.  Like clockwork, I do a battery pull ever three days because the sluggishness becomes unbearable.  I've pretty much kept to the stock applications, because the few I've tried to install are non-functioning on this phone.  You can forget about playing games on it.Battery life is horrible.  Since it was new, I've had to place it on the charger every night before bed.  I never leave wifi or GPS on.  I rarely talk on it.  Basically I just use it for texting.  With that usage pattern, if I'm lucky I get 16 hours of up-time before it alerts me to charge it.  Sometimes it dies before that, and it simply goes dead iin my pocket.  Not a good phone option if you'd need it in an emergency while out and about.Google Maps and Navigation work pretty well, mind you it must be plugged in or you'd be lucky to get an hour out of it on just battery power.  It gets a little screwy if you receive a call while running navigation though.When it comes to signal strength, the signal indicator is more-or-less useless.  In my downtown office, it'll sometimes have full bars and two minutes later have nothing.  Sometimes it'll allow me to send a text, others not.  Sometimes make a crystal clear call, others not.  And this is all while sitting at the same desk everyday.  Same story at home.  When it comes to signal, apparently this phone is sensitive to whichever way the wind is blowing at any given moment.Texting makes me want to throw this thing in the street and let it get run over by a city bus.  I'll have days when the texts will quickly go out, almost instantly, like one would expect.  Other days, EVERY SINGLE TEXT will fail to send.  And it's not like other devices I've had that will try again once a signal is found.  This will just fail to send the text message, buzz you a warning, then allow the text to rot there.  It makes you go back in, hold your finger on the message that didn't send, click edit from a pop-up menu, and then attempt to send again (which will likely fail 2-3 more times).  Keep in mind, I'm in the same places every day and go between a large city and suburb.In closing, even at the current rock-bottom prices, I strongly suggest avoiding this phone.

A short one should do.The keyboard is fine, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the overall response of this phone is SLOW. I tried an app killer and a battery saver on it, but those apps further degraded the phone's responsiveness. Upgrading to Froyo improved things a bit, but still, the freezes and memory problems remained. Moving data through USB is sketchy at best. It sometimes cuts off when moving large amounts of it. Luckily, none of my data was lost. (I even made one backup from the micro SD card to a Western Digital 1.5 TB hard drive just before getting rid of the phone.)The camera is actually decent, considering that it lacks flash. It's better than the one that's on the LG Optimus V I now use, but I know my way through Photoshop, GiMP, etc. to fix photos if needed. Night mode actually works quite well. Video quality is passable, but with a poor video processor, it lags behind the LG. Speaking of which, Angry Birds and most other games run slowly, whereas on the LG, they run at a good (if not the absolute fastest) speed.Still, it fails where I need it most.

I played with a friend's Optimus and the swype really was the deciding factor for me.  I won't ever have it, and this phone has an excellent slide out keyboard.  The joystick is handy in tight spots and it doesn't only read fingers, it clicks in and out like a button on a mouse.  Youtube is great fun, and before I go any further just thought I'd mention the new Intercepts comes with android 2.2.2 already installed.  Only thing \"buggy\" I've noticed after having it a few weeks is the screen is reluctant at times to change over to the angle you are holding it, but not often enough to really gripe a whole lot.  I was worried about the difference in screen resolution between this and the Optimus, but it isn't that noticeable a difference while watching videos, to me anyway.  If you want a full sized qwerty keyboard, this is the way to go over Optimus.  Hope this helps someone else who is having trouble deciding.  Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention tethering is awesomely easy, and you can \"root' in less than 5 minutes without needing to involve your computer.  Tethered connection is lightening fast and working 24/7.

I paid $197.00 (+ tax. Price was originally 219.00, but I used a 10% off coupon) for the phone and $26.89 for the $25 Beyond Talk plan. This is my first \"high tech\" phone. I had a Virgin Mobile plan in 2004 when I was 13, then had a cheap Trac Phone followed by the Rumor and most recently the Rumor 2 on Sprint. I wish I would have found this phone and plan sooner because...wow! Honestly, I could have done without the $219.00 price sticker on the phone, but I'm glad I did pay for it because both the plan and the phone are just what I was looking for. I mean, really, $25 for unlimited data, web, text and 300 minutes?  It's the best deal out there. All other plans of this caliber are at least $50.Ok, so about the phone now. :) I've read a lot of reviews and was thinking that I was going to need to install a different browser or have it updated so that it would be faster but in the 4 days that I've had it, it hasn't seemed slow at all. I haven't needed to restart it due to freezing either. I'm still getting used to it and figuring out all the different aspects of it. For instance, I knew I could slide my finger to the left on the home screen and have more space for buttons, but I just figured out this morning that I could do it the opposite way as well. I really like the pull down screen at the top that shows what's running as well. I like the feel of the phone; it's not super heavy and is just the right size. I've been looking at touch screens with slide out QWERTY's for a long time now and I think this was the best choice. The keys on the Keyboard are huge. I think the only thing I don't like about the phone is the way it slides. My Rumors would slide to the left and this slides to the right. No big deal though. The touch screen is responsive and does what I want it to if I'm paying attention to what I'm doing.I get pretty good service except when I'm home, but then I have my home phone and computer. I can actually access Facebook now. My rumor 2 wouldn't accept my password even though it was right. I love the app store. The first thing I downloaded was the Kindle app and the second was Spaghetti Marshmallows :D. I took me forever to load music on it though. I finally figured it out but I don't think it's the correct way. But hey, it's working for me. Battery is just ok for me. I'm not usually a heavy phone user but since it's new and I'm trying to figure it out and I can do so much more the battery is only lasting a day. I don't mind putting it on the charger while I'm at work or before I go to sleep.Anyway, I think this is a great phone and an even better no contract plan.

In my quest for anonymity, I picked up the Intercept lightly used from Amazon and got the $35 Virgin Mobile plan.  One less recycling entity on my credit report, a cool phone, and CHEAP!  In the beginning, The phone was as responsive as I needed it to be.  I'm a heavy texter, pic taker, file storer, and music player.  I don't bank, tag, 4square, or map from my phone.  Don't want to. So at a year into ownership, it's gotten sooo slow on even the non internet functions.  Most of time I can't get the phone to power on or charge without an error, when it rings the screen will freeze and I can't even answer the call let alone trying to use turn by turn navigation.  And it did not come on slowly.  One day we were good....the next we were very bad.  So I would say, the intercept is a good 1st phone in your foray of Android devices.

Terribly frustrating when you just MUST update your FaceBook status on the go...  7)  The battery life is abysmal.That's the 'short list' of problems.My 2 teenagers each have an iPhone (which they bought with their own money, I'm pleased to say).

That was cheap and all the internet/data plan you can eat. However, limited minutes or pay almost as much as a contract plan.I figured an Android phone would do the trick. I chose the SAMSUNG INTERCEPT. I was looking to use Skype in the WiFi zones and save on my minutes for talking there. I could really save money.Well I received the Samsung Intercept and gave it a try. I liked the Android OS. It was more complicated than the iPhone but I was willing to give it a try. I went to the Android Market and installed Skype. It almost worked. After hours of trying to get it working, I found out that Skype does not work very well with Samsung phones. That was a blow to my strategy. I would now have to pay for more minutes to talk.I still kept the phone.As time went on, I found it to be a love and hate relationship. I really tried to get to like it but too many things were not like-able on the Samsung Intercept. Here is a list:-Poor Battery life. You want a smart phone to be able to use it. Well the trick is to turn almost all features off to get it to last more than 8 hours, even with out making phone calls.-Screen is poor. The pixels and resolution and size just does not make reading the phone like-able. It was very difficult to read characters and numbers on the screen.-Very slow. Even though it is a faster processor, it simply is not fast enough. I would press the screen and would not get a response. Do this every day - like trying to answer a phone call - and you become frustrated and begin to hate the phone.-Almost everything else is just not enough to make the phone worth while.This truly is a phone that should not be ANDROID. It has the lowest specs for hardware and just barely works.In my case, I became frustrated with this phone. I almost just wanted to throw it away. Well after 8 months of trying, I finally did replace it. I went to Virgin Mobiles PayLo and purchased the cheapest LG DUMB phone.

A lot of them seem to have pumped up the phone with a five star rating. I might have done that too if I was the kind that did ratings when plum in the centre of euphoria. An Android on a $25 unlimited web/talk plan was certainly cause for unbounded joy. Four months have gone by and while I do not regret the Virgin Mobile service so far (cut my phone bill by half), the phone, on the other hand, is aging fast. If you are switching to Virgin Mobile you are a value oriented/budget conscious buyer. Be advised, buying this phone for anything more than $100 won't balance your budget well in the long term. This is not a phone you want to hang on to for more than an year in my opinion.(I accidently ended up posting the below on the Intercept for Sprint forum, so I am borrowing it.)1. Be warned, first, that making phone calls on this phone can be a pain. Often requires multiple steps involving imprecise tapping and/or scrolling to get to where you need to be. The voice dialer is no great shakes.2. Between the apps you buy and the bloat/crapware that comes with the phone you end up with too many battery killing apps in the background. I mean you have junk like Amazon MP3 app that you can't remove without rooting the phone! It just bugs me.3. The battery life is deteriorating fast. And the kind of things the OS does to preserve battery life really suck. Most of them involve dimming and sleeping too quickly. You can adjust this through a system setting though...4. I have also come to dislike the Android OS. The engineers who gave us Google search could not have been the ones who built this dud. Scrolling and tapping are painfully off. Too insensitive or too sensitive. I keep knocking the tiles from the main screen into the side screens or the pull up screen. Swiping from one screen to another is a pain. Using the on-screen keyboard - just forget it. The notification shutter will often time freeze. Also the grid interface is really getting to me. There's no organization whatsoever.5. Email attachments get dropped frequently. This might be a service problem.6. The slide out keyboard is both a boon and a bane. I don't know where I would be without it. On the other hand, using it is an intense exercise...On the plus side,You are in the smartphone world and it is better to be there. The wifi option/gps navigator/productivity aspect, say, when you are in a store and looking for info is great. I am texting more and happy to be doing that. Consider another phone/OS though.

Here is my history to share for those interested:First I received the samsung 6 months ago and although I loved the VM plan, the phone was buggy, sometimes it would jam, sometimes it would not respond to buttons or the notifications menu wouldn't work. First I experimented with Juice defender and green power free. Green power free is smaller won out, next  I downloaded the Android froyo upgrade 2.2, improvements but Still had problems with delay in the stock launcher. I experimented with Go Launcher ex but although it had great flexibility, it also froze my phone after using for a day or two. So I switched to the free Zeam launcher and it has been working for weeks now with no problems. You can adjust the screens from 3 to who knows how many. I'm happy with 3. My games and programs loaded on the phone are papertoss, angry birds, tank hero, touchdown for my company email, yahoo, Stock browser , Superbox (wihich is better than Android assistant) and many more. I also have the power control widget loaded which allows me to directly control my WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS and screen brightness!  My VM Samsung Intercept is rock solid with no problems and I wanted to share this to anyone having problems. It does so much and the plan is incredible so I will give the pluses and minuses of both:Phone Pros:bright screenbuttons react quickbattery lasts all day (with green power free app)plays mp3's, videos and you tubeMany free apps from android marketconnected to my yahoo account flawlesslyComes with thinkfree office which works on pdfs, docx, doc, txt and much more!3G Connection is 4 times faster than my old blackberry I don't even need the wifi connection.Connects to computer in a flash by usb (just touch the top notifications window and slide  finger down)Still camera or movie camera (great pics in regular light and good in low light) (does not come with a flash)The built in web browser works great, I installed Opera but did not see a difference so I deleted it.I love how you can more your fingers to increase the screen size while surfing the web.Phone Cons:touch mouse is too sensitive (thankfully you don't have to use it most of the time)VIRGIN MOBILE PLAN is fantastic with no complaints:Phone is working fine3G is working beautiul and its unlimitedText messaging works well very cool (never used this with my blackberry)All this for $25 and Virgin Mobile uses Sprint towersWill update in a few, but meanwhile I think this is the best deal on the market.Still learning this phone! I ordered the body glove and a 8gb larger micro SD card so I can put more info on the phone such as pictures, music, videos etc. The phone comes with a 2gb card.Clicking on the android market app allowed me to add the following great apps: Shazam which tells you what song is playing on your car radio or whatever,,,Touchdown which allow you to connect to your companies servers for emails, coffee shop finder, NYC streets, Amazon, the weather channel I could keep going on and on. The best app for me is PDaNet. This app allows you to connect your laptop to your Samsung intercept for internet access. It works incredible. I don't need a 3G adapter anymore. I just use my Samsung Intercept. By the way, the BODY GLOVE I ordered from Amazon is fantastic. It protects the phone, screen (with out covering it) comes with a  nice swivel belt clip and a built in kick stand for watching videos on your screen! I have dropped the phone twice (my fault) and the body glove protected it beautifully! Love this phone.SECOND UPDATE:There is an app called navigation that uses google maps that came with the Samsung Intercept. This app is incredible.

The thing that was the most frustrating for me was it's inability to efficiently perform the basic purpose of a phone: to make a simple phone call. I have had this phone for 2 years, and these are the reasons why you should not buy it:1) It takes 10-30 seconds to make phone calls, and often crashes in the process.2) Text messaging is slow. Slow to load. And when it looks like it has loaded, it hasn't, and you still can't use it. When typing in a contact, for the first 15-30 seconds it won't load your contact options. When you receive a text while typing a different text, it will exit what you're typing and take you to the inbox.3) Internet is slow4) Applications are slow5) It sometimes won't turn on and just sit in a blinking \"samsung\" limbo6) The camera is slow AND takes terrible pictures7) It is much too easy to push buttons unknowingly when you're talking on the phone8) It sometimes won't show you the caller ID until you have no time left to answer the phone9) Sometimes it won't let you answer or hang up a phone call (I've had to take the battery out to end a phone call on far too many occasions)I would have been happier with a basic non-smart phone. I eventually gave up on using this phone for anything other than trying to make phone calls and texting. It is not a good phone for social media or applications. This phone is just plain slow in absolutely everything you want it to do. The only thing good I can say about it - is that it DID last me 2 years. And I only suffered with it so long because of our plan contract. But if you want a durable phone, and making calls and texting is something that's important to you - you'd be better off getting a basic phone. If you want internet capabilities - get a different smart phone, even if you have to spend a little more money.

Nothing illustrates this more, than my experiences with this Samsung Intercept.Since Virgin Mobile, for some reason, still sells this phone in their lineup (and because this review was REJECTED on their website when I attempted to submit it), I made it a personal duty to tell my experiences HERE with this phone, so others won't make a similar mistake.Quite simply, this is the WORST brand new cellphone that I have ever bought in close to 15 years of buying them.I have NEVER had a cellphone for such a brief period of time (five months) and run into so many problems and deficiencies with it. As someone who always keeps their phone protected in a case and doesn't abuse or drop their phone, to any degree, there's no reason for such a relatively new phone to be so problematic.The screen freezes now CONSTANTLY when using the phone and requires you to force close down the app that you're using. The screen freezing gets so bad, at times, that turning off the phone and turning it back on again, doesn't even work. In cases like that, I have to access the back of the phone and physically remove the battery and then turn it back on.If this isn't bad enough, there have been times when the phone dialer does not work and I can't complete a call. This actually happened to me in an airport getting ready to take an international flight.How frustrating do you think the experience of not being able to make your last calls before your flight out of the country, would be?The phone's internal memory is an absolute joke for a smartphone.Even as someone who is not heavily reliant on a cellphone, I STILL have managed to exhaust the phone's internal memory with the apps that I have downloaded to the phone, which is NOT (comparatively speaking with other people that I know), a lot. Even AFTER I move every single app that I possibly can that the phone will allow me, to a memory card.What makes this dilemma particularly egregious, is that there are apps that already come installed on the phone that they will NOT allow you to uninstall. Apps that I have absolutely NO use for. It's just RIDICULOUS for a so-called smartphone to have so small of a memory.The phone's battery life has ALWAYS been an issue.From what people have told me, smartphones aren't known for their extraordinarily long battery life, but still, at the end of a moderate use day with this Intercept phone, the battery is depleted. Keep in mind, a MODERATE use day.The battery runs down even when the phone is TURNED OFF. I have NEVER had a cellphone whose battery discharges its power, even when it's off.When you discover this fact for the first time (if no one ever told you), I GUARANTEE that this will inconvenience you.Therefore, it is ESSENTIAL that you carry some type of recharger with you, at all times, to be prepared for when you're going to need to recharge the battery. TRUST ME, you're going to need it.The WORST part, as far as I'm concerned, is that I actually had to pay top price for the phone of close to $200, at the time. You can buy it for FAR less than half that price right now here at Amazon for $70, and it's STILL overpriced, if you ask me.For the potential (and LIKELY) problems, I wouldn't suggest that you spend $25 for this phone.Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get yourself another phone that has far better reviews.I sure will.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "WORST PHONE EVER MADE", "Author": "Timothy Hill \"tsh85\"", "ReviewID": "RSHD4RPVQF6XQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worst phone I have ever owned in my life. Battery lasts about 2 hours max on a good day. That's with normal use and wifi off. This is the 3rd Intercept I have exchanged and they are all terrible.Very slow processor and very unresponsive. Locks up constantly and has to be rebooted. This phone shouldn't even be considered a smart phone or in the category with other droids. It is pretty sad when you have to recharge your phone every 2 hours throughout the day just to use it.I have owned $7.00 cell phones that worked better than the Intercept. Also I can't count how many times this phone has just turned itself off in the middle of a call with a full battery. All 3 of my Intercepts have done that, so I know it's a common problem with this phone and not just the one that I own.Sometimes you have to push a button 3 or 4 times before it responds. When you slide or drag the window there is always a delay and it stops constantly. This phone has the worst internal storage and memory around. At least half of the apps from the Droid market malfunction on this phone. On a normal day this phone will freeze up on me anywhere from 5-15 times, to the point that I have to open the back to take the battery out before I can restart.I really wanted to like this phone, but as it turns out, it's by far the worst phone I've ever used. To say it is frustrating is an understatement. The problem is its poor response. Frequently during daily use it is unresponsive. Especially after a phone call. It might take up to twenty seconds for the controls to respond. This is not acceptable!I am a certified computer technician. I work on and repair all makes and models of computers. I embrace technology and understand it. But I will never understand this phone! I have no interest in \"rooting\" it either. It should just work....but it does not. And please don't tell me I have \"too many programs installed.\" I don't have any. In fact, I've done a hard reset on this phone-twice-running only the factory installed programs and STILL it is totally unresponsive.I also find no correlation between what is running in the background and how the phone behaves. Every time I use the device I clear out whatever programs I'm not using at the moment. But it seems this does not make a difference. The phone has a mind of its own and it will behave any way it wants to, RAM or no RAMIf you go to cnet reviews you will see that over 80% of all the genuine reviews for this phone have 1 star or less. Samsung should be sued and should be put out of business for passing off a phone as bad as this to the consumer. BUYER BEWARE: If you do buy this phone it only comes with a 30 day warranty and everything will work great until the second month you own it........TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENTI regret buying this phone. But I'll keep it until my carrier comes out with another model that I like, then I'm gonna just trash the Intercept.

Sometimes it will ring continuously and you can't get it to do anything else so you have to remove the battery and reboot. The main problem is that it is painfully slow. When you turn the phone on the boot up process takes well over five minutes. The phone will also sometimes freeze up and you have to turn it off and then back on again. When you, push something on the touchscreen it might take 10 seconds for the phone to respond. Also, many of my apps frequently crash. Overall this phone is pretty much worthless and now that there are more phone options for Virgin Mobile there is absolutely no reason to buy this phone. I'm guessing that it will soon be discontinued.

I switched from T-Mobile, an expensive cell phone provider with good customer support, to Virgin and bought this phone in November.  The phone had its drawbacks.  It took forever to start up (for some reason this isn't true with the third refurb phone Virgin has sent me, but I'll get to that).  Its battery power was poor (I bought an extra battery to get me through the day).  Its audio quality was sketchy.  Its screen was skinny and hard to read.  But it was a basic Android phone and did more or less the bare minimum of what it was supposed to do.  Internet service mostly worked, but there were problems now and then, particularly when I was in LA.Then in early March, the physical keyboard started to act up. The phone was under warranty so I sent Virgin an email.  Three and a half weeks later Virgin sent me a refurb replacement (yes, Virgin customer support is very slow).  The refurb couldn't do internet except through wifi.  I called Virgin about 4 times about this.  They had me do this, that and the other thing with the phone and kept telling me \"wait four hours everything will work properly\".  It never did work properly.  I was polite on the phone each time.  Then out of the blue, my phone service was disconnected and Virgin dropped my phone number completely.  They didn't know if they could get it back, but said they would try and gave me a temp number.  It took a week before they reinstated my phone number, which meant people who had my business card and tried to call were out of luck for a week.Virgin also sent me another new refurb phone.  Again I had the same absence of internet.  Again I kept calling customer service.  Again they had me do this, that and the other thing with the phone and kept telling me \"wait four hours everything will work properly\".  It didn't.  Finally, they sent me a third refurb phone and told me that this time they were sending me a \"Class A refurb\".  I asked them what they had sent me in the past.  The answer?  Class B.  They were sending me defective phones.Thirty two days after I received my first refurb  phone, I finally had a cell phone that worked completely.  I probably spent close to 10 hours total dealing with Virgin over that time.  They are a cell phone service from hell.  I'm selling my refurb Intercept (you want to buy it?) and going back to T-Mobile.You pay a ridiculously cheap monthly fee with Virgin.  You also get ridiculously bad service.  My recommendation, if you insist on using Virgin, is to buy a phone with the understanding that if it craps out, just walk away.  Virgin works until it...doesn't.

This is a decent phone for the value. Virgin Mobile probably offers the cheapest plans on Android Phones. With that said this phone does Run Android, but it is not very powerful. I can imagine that better phones will have a much better experience on the user, but this one is decent if you plan on NOT using its Android Services as much. For Example:When you try to play a game such as Angry Birds it will open; however, it requires a great deal of time to open due to the phones speed. Once the game opens the game plays perfectly except for one issue.... It lags. Don't expect to play games as well as you would on an iPod Touch or an iPhone with a faster processor with this phone.Its battery life is decent aswell. I say it can last a good 4-5 hours of continuous usage or maybe barely make it through an entire day if you don't use it as much.Its keyboard is absolutely perfect! It is probably the best part of this phone. If you are planning on texting a lot than this is an awesome keyboard. It is backlit and it looks great at night.Its touch screen is ok and it is usable even with its slow processor.Overall I would use this phone for Calling and Texting only and maybe the occasional internet use.

I've had Samsung phones since 1999 Since 2009, I've used a Samsung Moment but the charging port recently died. I was paying just about $85/month for Sprint service. The phone \"insurance\" no longer covered the Moment because it was an \"unsupported device\". They could fix the charging port but would charge me $100. I was under pressure from the sales people to \"upgrade\" and could get a new phone for a reasonable price only if I signed a 2 year agreement, but I'd have to pay an additional $10 \"premium data\" charge per month. I wanted to keep my Moment. I didn't want to upgrade. I certainly didn't want to pay almost $100/mo for a phone. The best their 'retention squad' was able to do was offer me $100 off my next phone bill, which basically meant 'sign yourself over to us for $100/mo for two years and we'll give you one month free.' Um, no.A friend told me about Virgin Mobile and I went to check them out because I was disgusted with Sprint's customer service. The plans were perfect but the phones.. even their best smart phone was inferior spec/featurewise to my 3-year-old Moment. It made me very hesitant to try the service because I disliked the idea of paying for a new phone with worse specs than my old one. Amazon had better prices than VM's site, so I decided to try out the Intercept, since it was the closest to the phone I already had, to compare the VM service in my area.I'm not a novice to Android phones. The reason I've kept my Moment this long is because I was able to upgrade the kernel and ROM and get rid of the branded bloatware. However, I'm also not a power user/tweaker.When the Intercept arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. There was a minimum of bloatware on it to begin with. I rooted it and got rid of the bloatware and the EXTREMELY ANNOYING 'Virgin Mobile!' audio file at startup because really I do not want to listen to young girls shout a brand name at me every time I start my phone. Problem solved.I'm currently running the stock ROM. The very first issue was the Android keyboard on-screen. The keys were smaller than they display on the Moment and almost impossible to tap. I have very small hands and fingers and it was a problem; I can't imagine anyone with normal-sized hands working that keyboard. Thankfully, Swype works just fine and installed without a hitch. Problem solved.The slide-out keyboard is nice but takes some getting used to. The Function button is in the top left corner, with the 'A' key on the farthest left of the keyboard, so it makes typing more problematic than with the Moment's keyboard. It still has a dedicated number row, which I appreciate, and the keys are easy to press and seem to work well.I don't really notice any difference in resolution between the Moment and the Intercept. I notice a difference in speed and rendering - the Intercept plays Angry Birds in all versions without any problem at all and the Moment, even after upgrading to Froyo, still has artifacts and hiccups and lag. Caveat: I don't really play games other than Jewels, Tetris, and Angry Birds. I use it as an e-reader more than anything, and CoolReader, Moon Reader, Aldilko, and FB Reader all render fine and page turning has no lag. The movies/tv shows I've put on it render well and I've had no problem playing them at all. No lag, no artifacts, no locking up.I do notice occasional keypress lag, usually when I'm in a menu. There is also some lag loading web pages. Which is occasionally annoying, but also fairly easily fixed for anyone able to root and flash a new kernel. I can see where it would be very annoying for anyone who can't, though really, it's less annoying than the 'Virgin Mobile!' scream at startup.So far, the VM service is the same as Sprint's, which makes sense since they're using the same towers. I'm in a stucco building and my reception is fine. The microphone on the Intercept is better at white-noise filtering than the one on my Moment. I haven't found anywhere during my daily travels that the service is inferior. I have yet to test it in more rural areas.The battery life has been a pleasant surprise, but that could be due to the slow, lingering death of my Moment. Prior to the Intercept, I was charging the Moment at least twice a day because it would drain even on Standby over the course of 8 hours. The Intercept can go over a day on Standby, and at least a day with moderate use. It does not seem to like the wall charger, preferring the USB charge from the computer. It beeps a lot using the wall charger, but that could be the electric in my house being dirty.The only thing I really do not like about this phone is the lack of an LED flash for the camera. My Moment is two years older and has one, I don't see why Samsung left it off this model. Besides using it for pictures, I used to have an app that would allow me to use my phone as a flashlight in an emergency and now I can't use that. This, however, is a total first world problem, but it is one thing that made me hesitant to use VM. So far, it hasn't been an actual problem - I haven't taken a picture that made me go \"#$^@^ no flash!\" yet.One thing I really, really love about the Intercept is that the MicroSD card port is on the side of the phone. I no longer have to take the battery out to swap out the card, which means I can bring multiple cards with me on flights/trips with books/movies and swap them out without having to wait for the phone to boot every time. They also swapped the charging port with the headphone jack - on the Moment, the headphones are on top with the charging port on the side. The Intercept has the charging port on top with the headphone jack on the side. Which means you need to buy headphones with a 90-degree (\"L\" shaped) jack or risk shorting out your cords very quickly.Thus far, it's been an acceptable replacement to the Moment. I wish VM offered phones that were better, and I REALLY wish Samsung had put a flash on this phone, but for a $70/month reduction in price for the service, and for any moderate user of a smartphone, this is perfect.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wrong reputation...", "Author": "J.

I don't know if that's a standard problem with smartphones, since I haven't used too many, but after about 20 installed apps, you start to run out of space.

At first we were really excited. We got nothing from verizon (limited talk minutes and unlimited text) for over $100 per month. After switching we pay half and have droids (Samsung Intercept) with everything.Then issues started to arise. We have never been able to send or receive picture messages for some reason (still can't). We went out of town one weekend and all of a sudden the old pictures we had sent previously came through. We came home and again, no picture messages. Strange.Unfortunately, if you need to ever call their customer service you will find that you get nowhere. The call center is in Mexico and they have no technical knowledge whatsoever. In fact, they have \"reprogrammed\" my phone only to leave it worse than when I started. I have had to call back and have another person put my phone back to the way it was. Of course then they act like it's all good even though two hours later I'm right back where I started.Here's another example...my wife's minutes did not reset one month when she topped up. She got a text that she was almost out of minutes after about 10 days. She checked online and the counter indicated that she was 15 minutes short of her limit. However, when she added up the phone calls since she had last topped up (10 days prior) it equalled 85 minutes. Needless to say, she called the customer service number and spent over 40 minutes explaining this to the rep. 40 minutes! This of course was after the rep. tried to get her to send a text message to see if that worked (what?). Finally, after being on hold for an extended period the rep. came back on the line and said that she added the minutes since she last topped up and she is showing that only 85 minutes were used. Apparently she came up with that all on her own... Anyways, she finally did credit my wife's account with an additional 215 minutes to account for the error. Mind you, this was 40 minutes later.The typical response by customer service to any issue is for you to take the battery off of your phone and let it sit for at least 15 seconds and then power it back up. If that doesn't work, you're out of luck! In fact the last time I called I was told I needed to charge my phone because she thought it was starting up too slowly.Here's the lowdown.....So long as you have no problems with your phone or your account you will get a cheap monthly rate for the same thing that other carriers offer for 3x's as much or more.

Picture messaging on Virgin Mobile is a big problem with this phone, not just for me but I read a lot of forums that say the same thing. Sending and receiving picture messages works sometimes and other times you just get error messages. Turning the phone off and then on again sometimes works but it's like rebooting a computer and it takes a while. This is actually a problem with Virgin Mobile and not specifically the phone itself but I thought I would mention it. They supposedly have a \"fix\" for it coming soon. The phone itself freezes up sometimes which is annoying. The touchscreen itself as well as the four main buttons at the bottom can be frustrating. I own an ipod touch and the touchscreen on that is perfect. But with the Samsung Intercept, sometimes you have to try four or five times to get the touchscreen to work properly. The battery life is also horrible. I actually upgraded to this phone because I had to recharge my old phone every day. Well apparently the APPS on the Samsung Intercept use up a lot of battery life because I have to charge the phone up every day and that's even when I barely use it. And I only have 4 APPS downloaded that I use. The bright spot is the nice big slide out keyboard. The buttons are just the right size. The problem is that when I slide it out I'm either hitting the volume button or activating something on the touchscreen. Of course there is the Android market that has tons of APPS that you can download, most of which I find useless, but some are good. I do find it convenient that it has APPS for Yahoo mail and Facebook.

I was not happy to say the least.  In any case, I was finally able to log onto the internet and Google and access the Android Features.  Problems started cropping up immediately.

Accessing websites is slow.  I swapped to this phone from the Rumor Touch II and I would often revert back just so I could have phone service.  Granted, I have a lot of apps running, but they are apps I use to keep the Intercept from locking up even more.  I downloaded \"Angry Birds\" for my nephews to play, but it took up so much memory, I had to delete it.  I bought a Plantronics Bluetooth for the Rumor Touch and it was great... BUT it did not work with the Intercept.  I've heard a lot, both pro & con, about the Motorola Triumph on Virgin Mobile's network, and just purchased that.  I hope it works a lot better than the Samsung Intercept.  Plus work with the Plantronics Bluetooth I bought.  Again...  to me, the Samsung Intercept was a major disappointment to me.

At this time of writing this, Virgin Mobile offers you kickback minutes for each friend you refer. You can receive 60 minutes per friend referral up to 100 friends, or 6000 bonus minutes, per year. There are a couple websites you can plaster (promotioncode.org) your kickback code all over to get a large amount of these \"friend\" referrals. I have only had this phone/plan for about 4 months now and I have about 8000 bonus minutes. Because I bought the phone in November and the bonus minutes never expire, they roll over to the next year, and thus, my 8000 bonus minutes.Anyways, for 25 dollars a month and a little work on some of these coupon code websites, you can basically achieve unlimited everything for $25 a month.

Next it takes far too long to turn on, 1 minute 9 seconds to be exact. Then after, by my estimates 10 to 20 seconds for everything to work properly, apps etc. This is every time. I will never complain about my 20 seconds boot time for windows. Then theres the game the phone plays with wether or not the secreen light will on when I want it to or not. The phone is too slow.

Tapping the intercept power button and it may come on it may not. If it doesn't come on. Tap again, it comes on yes but way too long to make ma annoyed to press again. Except the second time the power button is pressed, there is a time delay. The phone lights up and goes dark. Sometimes, after tapping the power button the light never comes on. Then sometimes the light never comes on after tapping the power button. This is probably due to to the sensetivity of the power button. Annoying.Lastly, this phone doesn't turn off like my last androind phone while holding the power button. It will only turn off when doing thee sliding moting on the screen.

Hebshie \"@RONTHINKblog\"", "ReviewID": "R3J68AA3QG4AP7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After more than a year and a half as a very happy Boost Mobile customer, I switched to sister company Virgin Mobile solely because I wanted an Android phone with a full QWERTY keyboard and this phone was less than half the price of the Samsung Transform Ultra on Boost. With just over a month of use, I now know why the Intercept is so inexpensive...it sucks. It feels bulky and a little cheap but even worse is how poor it performs. The screen resolution is very low, making the on screen keyboard virtually useless, especially in portrait mode. It also makes the tiny screen seem even smaller than it is thanks to icons and images that are muddy and pixilated. Colors are also washed out and lifeless. If you think youll be playing games or watching video on this phone, think again. The screen does do one thing very well...attract fingerprints and debris. While all touchscreens are prone to fingerprints, for some reason the Intercept gets really dirty really fast. Because the on screen keyboard is such a poor performer, the slide out QWERTY must be used for almost all SMS and email activity. The keys are responsive and the backlighting is crisp and bright. The tiny space bar is annoying (shoved between the B and V keys) and the spacing might cause more than a few fat finger typos if you are used to typing fast.  Also irritating is the color palette chosen for the keys. Just about every key shares both a standard letter or number in white and a second FN option in flat yellow. When the backlight is off, the yellow chosen for the FN keys is so dull, they can be hard to distinguish. With the back lighting on, the yellow and white colors are almost too close in tone, making the whole keyboard look jumbled and messy. The slider is fine but it is a bit loose and jiggly...not a good thing for long term viability. Still, the QWERTY keyboard isn't the dealbreaker here. What I could not get used to is the absolutely horrendous responsiveness of the touch screen and the sluggish processor speed. Delays of five to fifteen seconds were the norm for even the most basic of functions...like calling up your contact list, phone dialer or email. If you need to make a call fast or in an emergency, delays like this could be very bad indeed. I ended up removing all but a few of my must have apps and saw little if any improvement. The phone would freeze, reboot for no reason and even perform poorly when using a fast wi fi connection from my cable provider. The camera is medicore and there is no flash. While I had great call quality and liked the Virgin Mobile online account interface, Boost offers a much more streamlined account management experience and a simple, painless payment process. The \"top up\" procedure with Virgin is clunky, confusing and took way too much time to set up. So, reluctantly, I'm returning this clunker to Amazon and buying the Boost Mobile Transform Ultra, the phone I now know I should have gotten in the first place. One note...this is yet another HUGE advantage of not being tied to a contract. Not only are there no activation fees with Boost and Virgin and killer unlimited everything plans for only $55/month, you can easily pop back and forth between the services (either out of necessity, like my scenario here, or just because you feel like it) and if you dn't like your phone you simply return it and get a different one...rather than getting stuck with a hunk of junk you hate for two years with the likes of Verizon or AT&T.;", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy this horrible phone", "Author": "R.

Ive had this phone for a month and in that time its relayed 2 facebook notifications to me out of at least 50 if not more.Virgin mobile does have a 30 day return policy. KEEP YOUR RECEIPT. When you buy, ask the seller how they handle the return policy. I knew within the 1st week that i couldnt live with this phone and keep from smashing it out of frustration, i couldnt find my reciept anywhere though.

I was so very wrong. THIS PHONE IS A CHEAP PIECE OF CRAP!!! At first I had trouble with the viewing the web on it. It was extremely slow and would freeze all the time. Plus I could not use this phone at work. No signal at all. So I decided to deal with it since it seemed to work fine everywhere else. 2 Months later the signal started to jump around like crazy. It would go from 4 bars to 2 to 1 to zero back up to 2 then 1 then zero again usually landing at zero so trying to send a text was nearly impossible. So I went from having at least one bar in my home to zero. Then it started freezing when I tried to text. And if I kept trying it would resend an old text. I contacted Virgin Mobile several times about these issues and they offered no help at all. All I got back were generic answers that a computer would give me. Once gave me an answer to a question I didn't even ask. Nice huh?! I tried calling but was also given the runaround. I was told they could not look up my info at this time. Blah blah.....Virgin Mobile may seem like a great deal but it is not worth the hassle. This company does not care about it's customers at all. Go with a plan with a better company. At least that way you can return the phone for another with little to no hassle. They refused to listen to me. They would not let me return this phone. They could offer no explanations as to what was going on and acted as though they didn't even care. Stay away from this company. THIS DEAL IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!

This is an infurating problem which happened to me while on vacation and relying on 3G for navigation.  No matter what I did, 3G always redirected to Virgin Mobile's site.  I spent about 4 hours of my vacation going back and forth with tech support, which proved useless.  They never even mentioned that this is a common known issue, rather they acted like it has never happened to anyone ever before.  Then I threatened to report Virgin Mobile to the BBB for fraud.  The next day my 3G was working fine, imagine that.On top of that, Virgin Mobile's top-up system is unable to process my credit card for no apparent reason so I need to buy top-up cards from the local drug store.  My card works fine everywhere else including on Amazon.com, and my previous carrier:  Sprint!  (note:  Virgin Moble USA is an offshoot of Sprint)The Samsung Intercept's notification bar randomly locks up.  Once that happens either you must reboot the phone (which takes 2 minutes) or you need to hold down the home button until the list of apps is displayed, then click the back button (takes about 5 seconds).  This is undocumented and rather annoying if you don't know about the home/back fix.Other than those three troubling issues, the device works fairly well.  I just hope Virgin Mobile fixes their contract renewal issues, since those are just simply unacceptable.For accessories, I recommend the Body Glove \"case\", the XtremeGuard screen protector, and an iPad-rated 2.1 amp car charger, preferably one with a secondary 1 amp socket (few other car chargers seem reliable)", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Pre-Paid Phone out in the market..", "Author": "Martha Uballe", "ReviewID": "R2W1EEZOMW55F4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the moment i saw this phone on the virgin mobile website, i fell in love with it...mostly because of the 25$ plan....this phone is the greatest thing i've ever bought. this seller offered the phone for almost 40 dollars off and delivered faster than others....whoever buys this phone, i hope you feel the same about it as i do.....", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Prepaid phone", "Author": "L STEVENS", "ReviewID": "R193PJPRCCWZD2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Brought phone for my 9 yr old son, which is 11 now.

I've yet to receive service from Virgin Mobile even though I have paid for it and they have billed me. My wife ordered two of these, one for her and one for me. Be aware that when you buy this phone you are going to require service from Virgin Mobile, and this is where you have to tread carefully. We received our phones, I went to their website and seamlessly followed the instructions to have my wife's phone number and mine ported over from T-Mobile. This morning, my wife received a welcome e-mail and her phone is working fine. Mine does not have service because whenever I make a call I get a recording from Virgin Mobile stating  that my account cannot be verified. I checked my T-Mobile phone and it does not have any service, which means that the number ported over to Virgin Mobile. I have spoken with at least 8 customer service agents at Virgin Mobile between yesterday and today, and I can honestly say I have never dealt with a more consistently incompetent bunch in my life! No one seems to know what is going on with my phone. They all tell me to try the same thing over and over again to no avail. I am usually a very patient person but today I finally had it and asked for a supervisor. They put me on hold for half an hour and then disconnected me. Don't take my word for it, simply Google Virgin Mobile customer service reviews and you will read about the nightmares people have had with them. Not only is my phone not working but I have probably lost a number that I've had for years due to their inability to port it over correctly and apply it. One of the customer reps actually admitted that they were trying to port my number over from AT&T; when I am 100% sure that I entered T-Mobile as my old carrier. If they do not recognize my account, how am I going to have another company port my number from Virgin Mobile? I am going to have to return my phones to Amazon, and start my search again. My advice, unless you are lucky enough and don't ever have to deal with Virgin Mobile customer service agents, stay away from Virgin Mobile.

Great at first. Cool features. Now all of us are having similar problems. Some small and annoying and some you want to throw it against the wall. I have seriously considered running it over with my truck on occasion. First the touchscreen works when it wants to. Sometimes if you tap the text app, it opens the camera or something other than the app you wanted. You have to tap several times to open an app. The notification bar at the top of the screen freezes up and wont let you slide it down, so if you have a voice mail, you cant slide the bar down and go straight to voicemail, you have to open the phone app, wait for it to load then dial your number. Ringtones work when they want to, 90% of the time my calls set themselves to silent even when the volume is turned all the way up. The phone is great for heavy texters, but you can forget about sending a picture message. It fails or if it does decide to go thru, the recipient gets it the next day. Half the apps you download you wind up uninstalling because they either dont work or start to work then takes you back to your homescreen.I have the bare minimum on my phone and it still needs to be charged constantly.To get in the phone app to dial a number takes forever, so it is definately not a phone to use in an emergency, you'd die before you were able to call for help. It does take good pictures, but again it takes forever to start up, so not a good phone for taking spur of the moment pics with.On the positive it is a durable phone. Has cool features if you can get them to work correctly, the service has been great, the plans are affordable. You can go online and top up your phone by your checking/debit account. Virgin Mobile has always been nice and helpful. Even for the money, you can get a better phone.
