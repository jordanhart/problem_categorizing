Although that seems to have corrected itself.  The battery life is still pretty good, i can go about 2-3 days between charges.  i just noticed that the fram connecting the two halfs has a small crack in it, but all function is still there.  The key pad is showing wear but buttons all still work.All in all, it has been a great phone.  Really would like AT&T; to bring the price down a little, especially for current customers, but hey thats what you get with corprations these days.The phone, well worth it, hope the second gen works as well as first.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "I was tired of making calls with my butt!", "Author": "B. Miller \"Rockin' for the Rock!\"", "ReviewID": "R1YCV8QDE0GFS7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because I am pretty hard on phones and am sick of replacing them all the time. Plus, I needed a flip phone because I'm sick of making calls and sending text by accident, and this phone is perfect. The Samsung Rugby is a seriously tough phone, and the flip up feature cuts down on butt calls.It's pretty easy to use, but if you're looking for something that does a million things and will impress your friends, this phone is not the one.It's a great basic phone that does all the important things: phone, text, push to talk, gps, and web. But if you spend half of your life on the phone looking for funny cat videos and keeping up with your fantasy bass fishing team, you should go with something else.I would recommend the Samsung Rugby SGH A837 to anybody that needs a good, rugged, basic cell phone that does a few extra things as well.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Speaker Phone & Excellent Customer Service", "Author": "Arthur Abott", "ReviewID": "R3UJBGY35L1KO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered (2) of these phones for my wife & I.

Phone was supposed to be Yellow and Black but I received, much to my pleasent surprise, the black one.I needed an unlocked GSM phone to replace my old tried and true Sanyo Pro 200 that was a CDMA phone on the Platinumtel network. They updated to GSM and sadly I couldn't use the Sanyo anymore.Despite the AT&T; logo that comes up when powered on.. it is indeed unlocked and accepted the Sim card without issue from PTel.I desire in a phone that it be fairly sturdy, a flip style, that it makes decent calls, doesn't require puzzle solving skills to use and has a battery that lasts more than a day or two. This one sounded like it would fit the bill and so far it has.I didn't think I'd find another phone that pleased me as much as the Sanyo did, but this one has been great!Calls are extremely clear.Accessories can be found cheaply. I wish it had come with a plastic belt holster like the sanyo did, but I've found and ordered one that is supposed to go with it.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "The only phone that can survive my brother and husband", "Author": "Elizabeth Draven \"KD\"", "ReviewID": "R2V4AJS4Z6GQRG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have bought this phone for my husband at least 3 times and my brother has had more than one as well.

I feel that a seller should report broken as separate from \"used\" allowing a buyer to decide if the broken part(s) can be managed within the expected future use of the product.A \"Condition: Used - Very Good\" cell phone which is advertized by the manufacturer and Amazon as a \"Samsung Rugby SGH A837 Black At&t; Rugged 3g PTT GPS Cell Phone\" should retain it's expected function even if \"used\" included scratches and or dirt. A \"rugged\" cell phone with a broken henge is no longer \"rugged\".This phone was purchased through and Sold by: Cell Phone StopWhile this vendor was courteous and amended my order to include an unlocked phone, they did not mention that they would be sending a broken phone. If Cell Phone Stop would like to offer compensation of some sort, I will edit this review to reflect how they addressed the issue. The phone is too inexpensive to go to the trouble of returning it.
