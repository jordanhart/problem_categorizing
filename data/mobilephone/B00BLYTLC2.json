{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Competition to Note II", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R3MMEY8D4OFZFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seriously, this is one tough competitor to Note 2. I just played with it at my friend's place. Screen is amazing. 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.5 inches (~401 ppi pixel density). Without the stylus, it is same size as Note 2. The crapware on this is incredible. I tried the AT&T; version. It has LG and AT&T; crapware, and is locked, otherwise the international unlocked and AT&T; versions are similar in specs. On the AT&T;, out of 32 GB, around 10GB was gobbled up by stock firmware and other crap.MicroSD can be expanded to microSD, up to 64 GB. The battery is removable, big plus. I was stunned by the photo quality. After seeing the photos, I thought point and shoot cameras are dead. All I can say is the LG Optimus G Pro is one heck of a device. Like in Nexus 4, the notification lights are awesome!Good that there is lot of competition. The phone currently runs 4.1.2, hopefully newer Android versions runs smoothly as well. If you are looking for phablets, you should seriously consider LG, Samsung and Asus. Yes, Asus has a 7\" phablet! (Fonepad, which I am using now as a primary phone as an experimentation for 6 months on a consolidation sprint)Highly recommend LG Optimus G Pro!", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awasome phone!", "Author": "Jp", "ReviewID": "R3CCW52I6SABFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first I thought the size would be an issue but it makes everything you do so much better. Now for the things I love about the phoneThe screen is big and beautiful. Browsing the Web, playing games,everything is just better.The led indicator light is around the home button which gives it a nice look.I like that the have a dedicated button that you can customize for any app you want.Call quality seems great. I had two different s3 and people often had trouble hearing me. That doesn't happen with this phone.Phone is very responsive with no slowing down or freezing.Some of the things include :The auto brightness doesn't work, but it's easy fix by just downloading an app.The home button should be easier to press specially since you use it so often.Taking a snap shot should be easy like in the s3.here you have to press two buttons and sometimes end up either lowering the volume or turning the phone off.Aside from these little gripes this phone is the best. since LG doesn't spend a lot in marketing like they can spend on creating a quality phone at a reasonable price.  Defenetly recommend to check it out, and don't let the size intimidate you. It is easy to get used to. I will update my review as I use it.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "AT&T; Version Running On T-Mobile", "Author": "The Graphite Girl", "ReviewID": "ROWQBDMBXMFWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content":

There isn't a hiccup, a stutter, a hesitation nor a delay.  I have never enjoyed an Android (or any phone operating system for that matter) as much as i have this phone.The one thing that i did have to do in order to make this a 100% perfect experience is to start using my husbands Samsung Exhibit II as a secondary phone thats always at the ready to handle small, little tasks, this was i never worry i need both hands free to use LG Pro and have to worry about dropping it. In other words, i don't try to do othr things AND use the LG O Pro.  For that i use my hubbys Samsung Exhibit, which i rooted & threw Slimbean ROM on it), added a 3rd line to my T-Mobile acct for just 10.00 a month.So now, when i just need to make/receive a quick call or important text msg, i use the \"lil guy\"... For any Picture taking/ Recording a video, Internet surfing, leisure communicating or video watching, game playing, Kindle reading, Remote Controlling TV (sooo easy & works soooo well : ), or the 100 other things this huge screen and lightening speed processor was made for, i use my LG O Pro.TGG", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "BIG, FAST, and CHEAP!!", "Author": "Phrancis", "ReviewID": "R2JSWS8KT0Z4A3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I just bought the white version of this phone a few days ago from ATT, out of contract for $400.

I would have loved a better quality camera, no custom android skin, stylus, and different button placements, but all the other tech attributes at this price is simply awesome. Sure, the upcoming Note 3 is better, but way too expensive and while the rumored Nexus 5 might be a tad cheaper, it probably won't have a 5.5\" screen and certainly won't have upgradable memory and batteries.

I am delighted to hear from you as our valued customer, I do apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced and I will be glad to help you out here.If you purchased a phone meant for an international market, that might give you issues when trying to use it in the United States since the networks differ to international models. You might need to contact the place of purchase because international phone models do not have a warranty in the US either since we do not have software and parts for those models. I am including a manual for the US version but since the phone is new, we don't have detailed instruction manuals just yet.If you ever have any other questions, doubts or concerns at all, please do not hesitate to contact us again either via email, or by calling our customer service division at 800-243-0000 at your convenience.Gustavo T.E-mail AdministratorCustomer Interactive CenterLGEAIThis communication is confidential, intended only for the named recipient(s) above, and may contain trade secrets or other information that is exempt from disclosure under applicable law.

I just received my unlocked white version of the LG optimus g pro today. It came with a Korean instruction manual so I was hoping to obtain one from your company via USPS, in English. The second thing I need is help on getting the phone to identify my google/gmail account. I have put in the correct email address for it and changed the password several times and the phone will not accept it. This keeps me from being able to use the internet and download apps and music. No point on having the phone if I am unable to do that. Is it just an update problem. I went to ATT and the personnel there said it's because it's an unlocked phone and said he could not help me. I've gone through every item in the settings and phone updates are the last thing I'll be doing. I just started to download the new soft version. I think it's the 4.2, not sure because it just shows an arrow now. I'm hoping the updates will take care of the problem. If not, what do you suggest?Why did I buy the international phone? I bought it so I could have the white one.  Now I have to hope for a refund and I guess be happy with the black one and a pink cover.UPDATE: Don't ask me how I did it, but I finally got the thing to work.  I went to the Google website and read from page to page and then to a couple of companies that UNLOCK phones (they were ZERO help...sorry, we can't help you with your problem) but the suggestion to go to the Google site did come from one of these companies and after reading for what seemed like forever, I went through the how to's for your Android device.  It was like PRESTO!  I couldn't believe it unless it needed to be registered first?  I did that yesterday but whatever happened it worked.  It still has a bunch of Korean pages on it but I can live with that because I downloaded a slew of apps.  I will say I love the phone thus far except for one thing at the moment and that is, it limits you to 80 characters (or 40) but think it's 80 on text messages or it won't send so you have to split them up to send.  I think that's stupid.  My old Atrix let me text as long as needed and just made them more then one text on the recipients part. And while I like the phone, I wouldn't call it badass!
