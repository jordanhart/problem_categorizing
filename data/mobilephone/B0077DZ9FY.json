It was not brand new however we accepted it.  Within 30 days we began to have a problem charging it.  I reported the problem (by e-mail since there is no contact phone number). They said the phone  was \"like new\" and offered to send me a new battery.  I told them to read my invoice,  it said \"brand new in box\" but I would accept a new battery if it would make the phone work.  I waited 7 working days and no battery.  Contacted seller again and he said if I didn't have it the next day he would send another!!  I thought that was unusual but then again I didn't get any tracking info.  I notified him I did not receive it the next day.  No response and I never got a battery;.  Had to file a claim with A to Z guarantee.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "very nice and they actually contact you back", "Author": "brittney_warden", "ReviewID": "R1HMCS34MM3KY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "awsome service and they are nice and do anything to make you happy they ship everything when promised but you have to be patient as well. but it does require a contract because I contacted Verizon and they said that it is not acceptable for prepaid.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Ronald Ellison", "ReviewID": "RKR5P2WCS18G9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this phone.

For some reason, when thephone is held upright, there is a problem with the keys. They are somehowunaligned. When I press certain keys, say the letter 'K'... the 'J' or the 'L' will appearon the screen. Therefore, I have to turn the phone horizintal; it works fine then.But, I cannot press send in the horizontal position. I must go back to holding the phoneupright to send the text. Of course, I did buy the phone used, but....", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone!  HTC Rules!", "Author": "eric", "ReviewID": "RY96RDIO5Y3GF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone.  Amazing features, screen quality, size, and durability (had it over 1.5 years and it's really handled the beating I've given it well).  It also seems to handle moisture and impacts well.  This is purely cosmetic, but the clear coat on the kickstand WILL all come off, and it looks bad.  If this bothers you... well I'm sorry, you'll have to deal.I am an avid android developer and I love this thing.  It's the first smart phone I've ever had and it got me into them big time.  This phone's battery life improves greatly with a solid undervolted kernel.  I feel like the battery life qualms with this phone are almost completely as a result of the software and not hardware.  I am not sure of this as I only had the phone for a couple weeks before rooting, upgrading the radio software and designing my own kernel.  My battery life is fine, at least a whole day and the next night.As far as a blank, open device for use with custom software, it doesn't get much better than this phone, and there is almost nothing of any real value that newer devices can bring to the table that this phone can't already accomplish with a little research on part of its owner.  If only it had MHL or a HDMI port, it could duke it out with the best smart phones of today.  Cyanogenmod ROMs work great on this phone, and the interface is sleek, snappy, and very modern.It is a bit heavy which leads me to believe that if you drop it frequently, you might have trouble after a couple of years or so.  It also might interfere with car mounts due to its weight.  Even with everything tweaked, the battery life is barely 17 hours with light - medium usage in an area with light cell signal.  The camera is great outdoors.  This is slightly diminished indoors and it's quite poor and grainy in low light.  The front facing camera is useless, unfortunately, even in good light.  It came with a 32G flash drive when I bought it which is amazing!  I like that it supports free wifi tethering and AVRCP too, plus tends to handle medium-high resolution vids well.  It will NOT play 1080P video smoothly, no matter what you do.  It works well for gaming and the touch screen is as responsive as you'd expect.  It also multitasks well.  I have had navi shouting commands through BT, music streaming, wifi tethering active with 2 laptops connected, and somebody playing temple run on this phone all simultaneously.  It did get kind of hot though doing all of this, but not alarmingly so, and battery lasted for almost 3 hours under these conditions.All in all, I love this phone, and when the time comes, I'll be going with another HTC device and likely pimping it out just as hard as the thunderbolt that started it all.  I deducted a star for battery life, front camera, and the heavier than necessary (in my opinion) weight.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Android OS\n4.3\" Touch Screen\n4G LTE\nNO Contract Required\n8MP Camera", "Name": "HTC VERIZON DROID THUNDERBOLT ADR6400 ADR 6400 4G LTE SMARTPHONEVERIZON WIRELESS CELL PHONE.
