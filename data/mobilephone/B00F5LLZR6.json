Tikhomirov \"kalistrat\"", "ReviewID": "R1B2EZRHBT2L1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my phone a few days ago and have been tweaking and setting it up to run the way I like it. First impression - I have a guilty feeling - because I want other people to see this phone and think: \"What is this?\" I took it to T-mobile store to get a new sim card, and the shop personnel gathered to look it it.I must admit that I have been a relatively dedicated customer of Sony. My previous phone was Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc. I really enjoyed using it everywhere I went: Europe, Latin America and here in the U.S. I used it with a pretty extensive number of mobile service providers, and it always worked great for me. But, the standards have changed and it seemed like a good time to start taking advantage of 4G LTE, faster processors and larger memory capacity. All of it really make no difference for a regular phone user. But, if you stay connected for business or recreational purposes you want all the high standards to be there. BTW, the main reason I wanted a large phone was because I am using it now more frequently than a laptop.Having said this, I need to add that I am not a heavy phone user, and my family plan is only 1000 shared minutes that we never use up between my better half and kid. Nevertheless, there is a number of android apps that allow me to stay current with all my e-mail, documents, messages, conversions and calculations that I find myself using more and more heavily, especially when I travel.This phone is beautiful and very convenient as a phone because it's very thin and relatively light. But, functionality-wise it can compete with any tablet PC. As a result, you have best of the two worlds.After using the phone for just 3 days I have been very impressed with it's smooth performance, high download speeds, easy, logical and highly customizable settings. Everything seems to work as it is intended by the company I can trust.The only thing I am not sure about is the phone's resistance to shock. I found myself handling it with extra caution. However, I am sure I will find out soon enough, especially when I go on my next international trip.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!!!", "Author": "m", "ReviewID": "R3TIYIEQW97BTO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Samsung note 2 since it came out and although it was the largest phone ever made at the time, I felt like it could be just a little bigger.  Then, I wouldn't need to carry both my phone and a ipad mini.  Well, thanks to Sony Xperia z ultra, now I have sold my ipad mini and this phone is the only thing I need on the road.  The screen is scrisp enough for me to surf the Web desktop mode.  And it is blazing fast.  I don't even get lte speed with net10 wireless, only hspa which is a lot slower than lte but it's fast enough when you have a blazing fast phone like the ultra.  It's so fast that I started using this phone as my computer, making word and PowerPoint docs.The thinness of this phone is unbelievable.  When I put it in my suit jacket, I can't tell anything is in there.  It even fits in my pants pocket when I'm not wearing a suit but definitely noticeable there.If you are like me, and you hate carrying a phone, a tablet, and a laptop around, try this phone.  You will love just carrying this around for all your business needs.  it's the biggest phone in the world at the moment, but it's also the thinnest and the fastest.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "If you are in the market for an all in one Android Device with more focus on screen size than anything else, look no further.", "Author": "Furby", "ReviewID": "R19148R0HRA3G4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, getting this phone was a gigantic pain due to UPS' screwups more than anything, but once I got it, good god was I in love. Let's dive right into it.Pros:Screen: In size, brightness, and viewing angles, I am very happy with the Z Ultra's screen. While it's definitely a smudge and fingerprint magnet, when it's on they are barely noticeable. The 6.44 inch size is perfect for reading as well; At night, when I'm going to sleep, I used to have to use a large tablet due to how bad my eyes are; However, I can read just fine on this phone. For gaming, it also cannot be beaten; It's size is such that you can actually emulate DS games and play them in portrait mode in full screen, and have room on the bottom for controls.Battery Life: Now, to be fair, I'm coming from the Nexus 10, and a Galaxy S4 that had an expanded battery, so I've been mildly disappointed by the battery life, but it has never died on me after a couple of day runs, so I'll give it a pass. For those of you who don't know, the biggest drain on a smart phone's battery is the screen, and this screen will provide a significant drain, so don't use it all the time.Thinness and form: Now, some people dislike the bezels, but I personally don't mind them and know that they're there because of how thin the phone is overall. Coming from how I felt like the S4 would break with casual use because of how thin it was, the Z Ultra feels like a tough, thin device.Software: Now, I'm the kind of guy that roots and installs custom ROMs, so I didn't give Sony's Skin a whole lot of time to impress me, but I did like what I saw. It's very light, fluid, and while it takes a little bit to get used to where everything is, it's easy to get used to.The custom ROM situation is distressing, however, with there only being 5 out at the moment, 2 of which are officially dead, and the other 3 being official.Negatives:Camera: I have to point it out, but I in no way consider this a negative considering I knew what I was getting. People, this thing is a tablet first and a phone second. It's camera sucks. It's camera should suck. It's a goddamn tablet camera. You will look like a goddamn fool if you take pictures with this thing. Please, quit trying to put a camera on everything.With that said, it also doesn't have an LED light on the back camera, which is disappointing. With everything I said above it's not too much of a surprise, but at the same time it means you can't use it as a flash light.Phone abilities: THis kind of goes in line with the above in that this is a tablet more than a phone, but I'll say it anyway: This thing is, for a phone, too large. If you are the sort that is always talking on the phone, holding it to your ear, etc, this thing is too ungainly for that on a regular. I'm not a heavy phone user, so I don't mind it, but if you're a big talker, you may want to look elsewhere (Or invest in a headset).------Summary: A great device whose only negatives come from the fact that it is more tablet than phone. If you spend your time talking on the phone a lot, this isn't the device for you. If you spend most of your time reading, gaming, watching shows, or what have you, and just want it to answer phone calls the few times you need them, this is the PERFECT device.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great size and phone, but awful camera.", "Author": "John Ramey", "ReviewID": "R1BPJH1VI5T2D9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's a shame Sony built such a beautiful phone that could own a market segment, but put a crappy camera in thinking \"this is for business users, not people who take pictures.\" The camera is shockingly awful in anything except perfect daylight (and even then it's subpar). Like 2005 camera phone awful.I bought this phone because I wanted one device to be both tablet and phone. I like the size of the phone a lot, but I'm 6'6\" and have large hands / pockets. I do think they could've shrank some of the large top and bottom bezel and added to the thickness in exchange, but that's personal preference.Great display. Solidly built. I love the waterproofing.Really hoping Sony gets it together with the camera in the next gen.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awful camera", "Author": "volodoscope \"Artist by heart, geek by nature\"", "ReviewID": "R2B44G5DTVCYQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think Sony did a good job overall. It's the only phone with awesome quality this size. The only thing that this can be compared to is Nokia Lumina 1520, but Lumina has superb camera.Here are the great things I found to be on point:-Screen quality-Waterproof-Speed and smoothness-Android skin is actually much more pleasant than, say, Samsung's-\"Throw\" feature to connect to various devices-LTE and other supported band makes this truly international phone-Expandable storage to 64gbs, although it's hard to manage and moving things from and to it-Design and build quality is superb-SONY's own apps like Walkman and Albums are pretty nice and actually usefulHere is what made me not like this phone:-Screen size with bottom and top bezels makes it very hard to use. It's this size that's in-between tablet and phone that I feel awkward using. Screen is great at almost all uses but when typing, browsing Chrome, using some of the older apps it really becomes hard to use and uncomfortable. I found myself always stretching fingers to reach things. Even the setting to type with one hand doesn't work because holding this thing with one hand is already hard and uncomfortable,  let alone type. Sony shocks have though of different layout for keyboard options (Windows 8 does this really well with split keyboard).-Ui and Android 4.3 are really not made for this size. Almost all the apps you get are either stretched to this big screen or leave a lot of empty space. Developers are not using space very well, this can be very noticeable with games. It's weird because the apps don't treat the resolution like a tablet, Nexus 7 has same resolution but most apps work well in tablet mode. This Z Ultra treats all apps like phone apps and so they just become gigantic.-Camera! It's amazing to think that Sony manufactures Iphone's lens and chip, but it's so clear that Sony is not great with making the software and hardware work together. I don't even bother taking photos. It's 8mp camera, but the artifacts,  compression, light sensitivity and color reproduction is just horrible. It also looks like an afterthought! Not having flash is understandable,  but having this kind of quality camera is just sad, coming from Sony.-Glass plastic covers was a huge mistake by Sony. Yes they tried to keep costs down and not have expensive anti-scratch quality glass. Their solution is plastic film that is glued to both sides. So you're not touching glass, but plastic cover. The problem is that this makes it finger-prints-hell,  prone to scratches and glare. Again, comparing to Nokia Lumina 1520, the screen glass and feel is subpar.-This doesn't replace tablet, like some say. It is a smartphone.-Mail is also quite bad and unfinished. If Sony wanted this to be an executive device where is the calendar, notes, mail integration. Even Samsung Galaxy Note 3 does a decent job at this.Overall Sony rushed with this model. I do give a lot of credit for the wireless system and accessories that make this phone work better, like the headset, music clip and stylus,  but without clear integration into the Ui and work-flow, these things become secondary and not easy to use. They did not spend enough time to make it one of a kind device with specific user interface. It's just their blownup version of what's on their Z series phones and not their Z tablet. I think a 5.5 inch screen would have been better.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "highly recommended", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R3RVJWCKYJ3UC4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm from iPhone and I never thought that this phone will Be much more amazing than other iPhone that I have, it's way better as in!!!

The Note 3 is fast, has a great camera, and looks infinitely better (subjective, I know) than most of its predecessors.Boy was I wrong. I'd wanted the Z Ultra ever since it was announced, but since I got the Samsung for almost nothing from my service provider, I'd been pretty much content. That is until I actually saw this behemoth of a phone at a Sony Center and spent more than a few minutes playing with it. Long story short, I sold the Note 3 after less than two months, switched to the Ultra and never looked back.I've now been using it for a few weeks, and here's what I think so far. The specs are widely published, so instead I'll just describe how it feels to actually use the thing:Build Quality, ErgonomicsThere's just something about a Sony device that screams premium. You get the \"money well-spent\" feeling that you don't on even a great device such as the Note 3 - which, good as it was, looked like a joke just sitting next to my wife's iPhone 5C. The Sony, on the other hand, is the first device I've owned that can hold its own against the iPhone (arguably the standard) in terms of looks.The sides of the device are pretty standard. On the left you have the micro-usb port (covered, for water-proofing), and the magnetic charging port (for the DK30 dock). The right side hosts the 3.5mm audio port which interestingly doesn't need a cover, microSIM/microSD card slot (again, covered), the signature round Xperia power button and the volume rocker. On the bottom side are the lanyard port(!) and the speakers which, being waterproof, might not be loud enough for some.Round back, there's just a Sony logo and the NFC icon, plus of course the 8MP camera.The Ultra's form factor however, while in keeping with Sony's \"Omnibalance\" design, honestly makes it a niche device for me. At 6.5mm thin, the Ultra wins points for being very light for its size, but it also makes it a little difficult to pick up when sitting on a flat surface, at least without a case on. Also, while the Ultra's size really makes for a truly enjoyable web-browsing/movie-viewing experience, it makes using the more mundane features -such as texting, or taking phone calls- awkward to say the least. I stand 5'10 and have fairly large hands, but I still can't type on it comfortably one-handed (you can try, but you risk having it go against the unyielding pavement \u2013 which I\u2019m sure will win that fight). Similarly, holding the thing up to your face for a phone call will get you funny looks - too bad as call quality is actually rather good.DisplayWith a device this large, the screen should definitely be its strongest point and with the Ultra, I'm happy to say it is. Gone are the original Xperia Z's horrible viewing angles and washed out colors - the 6.4 inch, 1080p Triluminous display delivers accurate colors and while it is quite noticeably different from an AMOLED panel, it really feels like looking at a mini TV. A high-end one. The screen dominates the front of the device, being shared only with a single Sony logo, front-facing camera, proximity sensor and the notification LED.The top and bottom of the display make way to a rather significant bezel. Others have argued that a smaller bezel would've made for a more attractive front, but I've actually found the bezels useful. I rest my thumb/s on them to support the weight of the device when reading; the Ultra renders text (in ebooks, browsers etc) so crisply it has completely replaced my 3rd-gen Kindle as primary reading device.AudioThe speakers, as mentioned earlier do not reach very high-levels, which is perfectly understandable given the Ultra's water-proof nature. There are more than enough bluetooth speakers around though to address this(such as the Soundfreaq SoundKick) - some are even NFC-enabled (such as the SRSBTM8) making for near-instantaneous pairing.The 3.5mm port on the other hand, delivers clean, quality output (my Z Ultra didn't come with earphones, I use Sony XBA-20s) up to decent levels, and i've never had to crank the volume up to more than 60%.Software/PerformanceI've refrained from using superlatives so far - but here goes: the Z ultra is without doubt the fastest Android device I have used. Never mind benchmarks - the thing positively flies. Opening apps take no time at all, transitions are smooth, and multi-tasking doesn't even feel like it even with 15 tabs open in Chrome. At any given time I usually have Kindle, GMail, Falcon, Hangouts, Live Wallpaper and Pulse running in the background (among others) and I've yet to see any form of stuttering. I don't know whether this is because of any conscious tweaking done by Sony, or due to the lightness of the Xperia UI (not too much bloat, thankfully!) but either way Sony has done a very good job with squeezing every bit of power from the Ultra's Snapdragon 800 and 2GB RAM. The Adreno 330 deserves praise too, if only for the gaming performance:..which is also a delight! On the Note 3, with its CPU clocked an extra hundred hertz and additional GB of RAM, I was dismayed to find that my favorite games would still lag (Riptide 2, Lego Brain Attack, Angry Birds Go, Table Top Racing etc). No such problems on the Z Ultra, in fact the only annoyance you're likely to come across is the battery drain, which is understandable after losing yourself to a game or five.Some of that performance prowess may have to do with the near-stock Android 4.3, too. And with 4.4 (with its not so insignificant enhancements) in the pipeline, the future is looking good.CameraWe come to the one component of the Ultra which disappoints, the Camera. An 8MP, no-flash shooter will quite understandably not perform well in low-light, but my gripe is even in proper daylight, pictures taken with the Ultra seem to be too soft. I'm fond of taking pictures of important documents (or whiteboard notes after meetings) and uploading them to my Evernote account, but even pictures of text don't seem to come out well. I've tried the stock camera app on various firmware versions, using both Superior Auto and Manual. I've tried third-party camera apps too, and none of them deliver acceptable images. Even my venerable Galaxy Note's (N7000) captures were nicer.Granted, most people refer to the Ultra as more of a tablet than a phone, and tablet camers never have quite performed well. Still, I wish Sony had included a better sensor (instead of an aging Exmor one) even if it meant an additional 1 or 2mm to the overall thickness.Battery LifeWith such a large and beautiful display one can't help but use the Z ultra. Kindle takes the top spot for my daily usage, then: RSS/web-browsing, emails, texts, and a few phone calls. With LTE on all the time, I typically have 15% left by the end of my day. With less heavy data usage, the Z Ultra could easily last a day and a half.ConclusionThe Xperia Z Ultra is a very, very good Android device, for almost any type of user (not those who like to use their cameras, unfortunately). It's fast, gorgeous, and its sheer size allows for an unmatched media consumption experience. Camera-aside though, it is this same size that will either draw people to it, or turn them off entirely. It is just too big to use as a phone normally! If one has a separate phone though (a much smaller one, hopefully!) or is willing to invest in the various accessories (QX10/QX100 for the camera, SBH-52 for telephony), or just flat out smitten with it enough to make the purchase, Sony has delivered in the Xperia Z Ultra a device that is so much more desirable than the others in its field/form factor.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phone to Phablet", "Author": "Vaneticorum", "ReviewID": "R24Q3I0MRJ1YXF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Z Ultra I purchased from SHOPEBEST was delivered through FedEx. It was in its original packaging and placed in another cardboard box with bubble wrap (it was safe).Dislikes:Camera - worst camera I've seen on a phone in 2 years; not sure if it's 100% hardware or a mix of hard/soft (pictures are \"noisy\")Bezel - I feel the bottom portion could have been largely reduced and functionality would still exist (Do we even still need bezels)Likes:Battery *1Screen size (great for watching movies and playing games)Stock UI - better than vanilla Android in many ways *2Build quality - makes my Galaxy Nexus and most Samsung phones seem like children toysSD card expandable storageNative tethering with hidden SSIDDualshock 3 controller support*1 - I have tried to test battery stamina in different ways every few days or so and I've found that, with ~75% brightness, my screen on time is 4+ hours on average with \"Stamina Mode\" and 2 hours 45 minutes [minimum] without it. Stamina also allows me to set up specific apps that can still work around it so text&calling; (already exempt) plus any other notifications I chose still work. I have even spent ~2 hours watching episodes streamed from Hulu and had more than 15% battery left before putting it on the charger and going to sleep. Seems that, unless you watch 3+ hours of videos over LTE when you first wake up, the phone will keep fighting for you until the end of your day. I am not very clear on what battery life \"should\" look like for LTE devices nowadays. Still, I am pleased and impressed by the Z Ultra.*2 - I typically like to root, unlock bootloader and ROM my devices as soon as possible. So, my first day and a half were spent doing so and trying to figure out how to get Paranoid Android working. While navigating the UI during this process, I noticed little features (gimmicks) that actually made me return to stock within an hour ROMming. I may love PA on my Galaxy Nexus but this device works very well with the UI Sony built. Things I don't like about stock is the persistent indicator dots on the Home screen, the NFC logo and the inability to hide apps from the app drawer. However, these nuances don't bother me enough to install a new launcher. I have made modifications to the stock UI with Xposed (root required) and don't feel I'll stray from OTA updates again. (Still can't find a way to get rid of the \"N\" coded into the Notification bar)Possible Con - This phablet is quite loud even on its lowest setting. I used Xposed to change the controls from 15 to 30 volume steps and the speaker still refuses to use its inside voice. I am happy with the sound for sure.This is not a device I recommend to anyone looking for a new 'phone' with a comparable or improved camera to your current/old device. Nor do I suggest this to anyone who can't like phablets or those who carry tablets already.My recommendation is for anyone who wants a large screen for watching movies/gaming but doesn't mind the physical length that comes with it.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very, very happy with this choice", "Author": "Javier Elizondo", "ReviewID": "R3595YC41TUH4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You have a Bravia in your hands with 1920x1080 pixels.My wife has the Z1 and I the Z Ultra.

I got that off of another active T-Mobile phone.The phone is supper fast and responsive.  It is large and can be a little awkward to handle but  I wanted a Tablet/Phone so I was expecting that.  I would recommend this phone.  I have never owned the Samsung Note 3 or Mega but from what I could tell as far as processing speed this phone was just as fast if not faster.  I did get a prompt to update the operating the  system shortly after I connected to the wireless network.*  I have had this phone for a week now.  The Battery life is amazing.  It goes for ever.  I purchased the Sony Case that has the backup Battery pack so it can charge on the go but I am thinking that was not needed for day to day use.  The battery is amazing.  I have been less than impressed with the speakers.  They are average at best but do the job.  I think you expect more from the speakers because the picture is so amazing. This is solved obliviously by using head phones or plugging it into some desktop speakers.  I need to do some more testing but I think because this is an international version T-Mobile has not been able to dumb it down and restrict it from creating a mobile hotspot.  I guess I will find out once I get a bill but I think it is allowing other devices to share the 4g data and I did not have to call costumer care or add anything to my plan.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "Rhonda J.", "ReviewID": "R39DJPQDMRWNDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes.

My only complaints are that at times it is slow to \"wake up\" initially and I would prefer to have access to carry an extra battery as backup and replace when desired. However, the battery normally does well at lasting me all day which is much better than what I could say of the S3 that I replaced with it. It works fine on T-Mobile for me including LTE which was my main concern when going with a phone not offered directly by them (or any carrier). I think that T-Mobile is missing an opportunity to market a phone that was the best option (for me IMAO) on the market with a screen size well over 6 inches. There were a few things the Note 3 might have that this did not but with the larger screen size and lower unsubsidized price I've been happy with my purchase. I don't see myself ever using the waterproof feature to take pictures underwater, but I don't have to worry about it getting drenched in the rain or soaked by other real life occurrences.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "R1J6QNGYJB8KY0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would recommend this sony xperia z ultra c6833 to anyone who loves big screen only....6.44 inches screen...the phone is actually 6.9 inches tall....I just wish sony will make a 7 inches screen phone....I will surely buy it....", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Phablet", "Author": "Zhi Li", "ReviewID": "R267VX6GQ7MBWM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a phablet long time, this one is best, big screen size with high quality.I like the hard pen touch instead of finger only.Stamina mode is good, it saves power.Use Sony SBH20 bluetooth headset work together, pretty cool.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "very satisfied", "Author": "Albert A.", "ReviewID": "R36M8DK2ZM8X4T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Could have better camera.

This is the biggest, fastest out there so I can see what I want to.  Potentially it replaces my Kindle so I only have to worry about 1 device.  Every time I've gone into the T-Mobile store the sales people are all borrowing it to try it and wishing they had one.  Only downside is no flash on the camera, but since I have a real camera which I use most of the time, this isn't an issue.  The surprise is the Note 3 which falls short in several aspects is priced about $200 more.  I bought this for $510 and I see now they sell for $30 more.Setting up the data connection was a little challenging as there are about 3 places where you have to get it right, but now it's working fine and very fast.  With luck it can last for at least 3 years.Update!  Battery failed after 5 weeks. Sony repair is a nightmare!  Got an Repair order with one call and sent it express mail late Thursday night. They say 14 business day turnaround which is far too long to start with. I called about a week ago and they couldn't even tell me if they got it! Promised to call back the next day, which didn't happen.  Called back on Friday and this guy promised a call on Tuesday after checking with factory. Called today, Wednesday and they finally said they had the phone, but couldn't work on it because it came from Hong Kong?  So they will be sending a replacement but when is anyones guess and this means I will have to start over and spend a day setting it up.  All this because of the battery!  This is the 13th or 14th business day although they say they didn't receive it until the 7th, which is likely a fabrication.
