BUT I needed a knew phone asap. So I went for it. And after a week of waiting it came. and let me tell you. Its a great phone. Still trying to figure out how to screen capture. but I haven't had any issues yet. It charges fast. Connects to your service well. Still waiting on a case to see how it fits. but everything is the same as a note except the camera is on the left. other than that great phone. Call quality is clear. Music and headphones is clear. the speaker is clear and loud.

Don't expect to write but when you navigate in the web really helps in the small Tab.Never locked, wi-fi works great, BT no problem either as phone or music. Display great, clear and bright.Battery life is standard. It takes around 1 week to start to be efficient.Fast with all the apps. Definitively suggested as product.Dual SIM, didn't try yet overseas but here works.Rgds", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "I really love this product", "Author": "Kellin S.", "ReviewID": "RA3RPFU3QHC6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great product for its price. It's beatiful, large good screen. Android 4.2 . Runs smooth. It brings two batteries, a screen protector, a plastic cover and flip cover-like case, not great quality but it's ok.  Got a bunch of pre-installed apps.About the stylus, it makes not much a sense, i rather use my fingers and it has no special software for it (Like the real note) but its nice, a special touch.It's one GB for apps and 1.65 free. Which it's ok.  You really need  an extra micro SD card.  You insert both sims cards and start working.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "kinda disappeared!!!", "Author": "Liannie T.", "ReviewID": "R2TCQLUWBMXEAS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a little disappointed because I can't get no phone covers for this phone.

We both agree that the phones are nice. I love the quality of the camera. I had no problem setting up my SIM card, I just popped it in the slot and put in my memory card and it connected right away. I use T-Mobile prepaid service. I just logged into my Gmail account and everything popped right up. I barely use the stylus pen but it works great. I love my phone....
