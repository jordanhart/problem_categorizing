{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing idea, but lacks critical features", "Author": "C. Hitchcock \"Infosec Dork\"", "ReviewID": "R39VGVTQ3L17Z8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a little while, and used it for about a 2-week period as my primary phone.  Overall, it's a good emergency phone, but lacks some features that I consider critical for an emergency device.Let's start with the good:-  Unlocked:  Yep...just take your SIM card and drop it in.  It even comes with a convenient adapter for mini-SIMs.-  AA Power:  Probably the single most important feature.  It runs off of the most common battery ever!  Lithium batteries will get you roughly 10-hours of talk-time, and have a 10-15 year shelf-life.Features that I'm indifferent about:-  Light:  While having a LED light is a nicety, I'd gladly give it up in favor of more useful features.-  Price:  $60 was a good price for a phone this simple, but I see that it's now $120 on their website...a tad on the pricey side for what you get.To be a \"real\" emergency phone, we need a few features:-  SMS:  SMS takes significantly less bandwidth and power than a phone call.  In fact, SMS will frequently work when phone calls will not.  I don't even need T9/predictive text...make it simple abc/123 texting and save on power that way.-  Screen:  I get the idea that they wanted to ditch the screen to conserve power...but seriously...it runs on AAs.  How about a cheap LCD screen?-  Ruggedized:  It's an emergency phone...chances are that it'll be abused.  While their \"fix\" was to provide a waterproof bag, I'd much rather have the phone itself ruggedized to protect against water/dust/shock/etc.All in all, it's not a bad phone for the $60 price point.  $120 is a bit excessive, especially considering that it lacks -- what I consider critical -- SMS functionality.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Emergency phone for my Senior-Aged Parents", "Author": "dmv", "ReviewID": "R226KM0DVYSRF2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought for my senior parents to keep in car.  Hoping they will use it if they get lost, disoriented, or have car failure.  Phone emits beep when turned on, then emergency button can be pushed and 911 is dialed automatically.

Although I did not buy it from amazon, it is essential to have in any car, emergency first aid kit, or a child's backpack. It is very simple to use. In any emergency, just press the red cross to call 911. The phone has GPS to notify 911 of your location. And if you are traveling, just slip in a prepaid sim card and you're set! I would also recommend this phone for the elderly. Big buttons and ease of use it very important in a phone like this. Overall a great buy without any flaws so far!", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Functional but overpriced.", "Author": "Lee Babbitt \"Lee Babbitt\"", "ReviewID": "RTVSPW91LMTSI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's now buried in my step-daughters car for emergencies.

Kramer", "ReviewID": "RF0YI9D253BHQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simply excellent!!! Works as advertized...

Anderson", "ReviewID": "R3GRM6O0M4HMC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The idea behind these devices is a sensible one:  Make a cheap GSM phone that can operate on a disposable AA battery and keep it for emergencies.  Here's the problem:  The days of the GSM network in the U.S. are numbered.  When the GSM networks go offline, these phones will be useless.  Also, these devices aren't cheap.AT&T; and T-mobile have already begun taking their GSM networks offline in some areas, and AT&T; has indicated that it will turn off the GSM network everywhere in the U.S. by 2017.There is an easy fix:  The maker of this phone just needs to make the phones support the new 3G standard which currently works on all AT&T; and T-Mobile towers in the U.S.  Even better, they could make the phones support the next generation for mobile voice, LTE.  I realize that this would add to the cost, but at $50, this phone is already overpriced.This phone includes no screen, no flip mechanism, no battery, and no 3G, and so it should be cheaper than the comparable Samsung.  With no screen, there's no way to determine if you've dialed a wrong number until you hit send and see who answers.  To make matters worse, the tones that are generated when you push a button are wrong.  For example, when you push 9, it sounds like you are pressing 0.  All the digits are off in the same manner.  So, even if you could recognize the tones by the sound they make, you won't be able to use that skill on this phone to verify that you dialed the correct number.  Finally, with no screen, you can't send a text message.  In a disaster where mobile networks are overloaded, text messages are much more likely to get through - yet you won't be able to send them with this.Right now, you can buy an un-subsidized Samsung flip phone that will work on AT&T; or T-Mobile for about $20.00.  Those phones support 3G (not merely GSM), and include a rechargeable lithium ion battery, a color screen, and web browser.  If you want to be able to power it using AA batteries, you can buy the Energizer Instant Charger for Micro USB Mobile Phones.At $50.00, this product is way overpriced, and is already useless in some places and will be useless everywhere in less than 5 years.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "unique product", "Author": "suburb man", "ReviewID": "R2OFM2RPXJB88V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "purchased two of these phones. just for emergencies. one in my car and one for the house.just in case a storm hits and we lose power, this will be a great phone to have as it can last 10 hours on a single battery.i just pray that if and when a storm were to hit, cell towers arent affected. if so, the phone would be useless.perhaps would be cool if they can come out with the same sort of phone for emergencies but a sattelite phone instead?otherwise its a very basic phone which i tested and seems to work just fine once you slip your sim card in.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Never used it, just peace of mind.", "Author": "City Hunter \"City Hunter\"", "ReviewID": "R2UFMY5KU4VGRP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Can't say much about it.
