She insisted that I not get her the latest phone either... imagine my heartbreakThe phone looks nice just as it appears on amazon, and has a pretty friendly user interface. Has a touch screen and number key pad.There is a cool lock feature so that nothing is pressed when your ear is next to phone while talking. Speaker phone works well and is very clear. I can't speak for the camera... For what it's worth, I should be grateful that she can at least receive photos now...In all fairness the phone works well and is good for the price if you don't care for anything other than talking and texting.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent Choice....", "Author": "Jesus Perez", "ReviewID": "R4L63VTF2SUHF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelent Choice.

As a smartphone user, this phone is the most basic of phones and doesn't offer that many options even for customization and such. However, the biggest problem is that it won't turn on after using it for several days. My mom barely used it and when charging it one day, it automatically turn itself off and won't turn on again.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009I3825A"}}
