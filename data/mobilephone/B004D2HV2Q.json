I don't pay for data for them, but the data still works at all the wifi spots.  For them (they are tweenagers) it works great.  They can load games, songs, etc. It has a micro SD card slot so they can even download things from their laptops to play/view.  I would recomend this phone to someone who is looking for an inexpensive alternative to a smart phone.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004D2HV2Q"}}
