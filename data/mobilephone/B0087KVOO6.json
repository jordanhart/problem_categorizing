Was able to verify that it was in fact unlocked with a non-AT&T; SIM.  Added bonus: this phone is upgradeable to Gingerbread (Android 2.3.6), with the upgrade being a free download from Pantech.Here's where it gets a little annoying: the upgrade re-locked my new phone!  I was able to find an unlock code online (at a very small cost and a few minutes of my time) but it was an unwelcome surprise.  This phone is still a great deal (cheaper, even with the unlock code added, than a new locked one would have been) but it was an annoyance and someone less technical might have found it a serious problem.  Just be aware of this, if you are considering this phone and want to use the Gingerbread upgrade.--Edited 11/6/2012:  Used this phone on a 2 1/2 week international trip, and was very pleased at how the phone handled a number of different SIMs in different countries, in most cases making 3G connections, and proving usable on 2.5G/EDGE in the one case where it was not.  Really a pretty nifty little phone.My one complaint, and it's not a big one, is that unlike some other phones it could not automatically detect the data APN (\"Access Point Name\", needed for data service) from the SIM card/network.  This is never a big problem, and in general you can get the answer for the setting needed from the same people who sell SIM cards abroad -- but it's a nice feature to pick up automatically, that most newer phones have.  Definitely worth looking up for the bands of SIM if you're planning to use this as a travel phone, or off AT&T; (I assume it will pick it up correctly on AT&T.;)--Edited 1/4/2012: I wiped the phone to loan it to a friend, and we discovered that the \"Factory Restore\" wipe also gets rid of the unlock.  I had the code which I purchased elsewhere, but for those buying this for unlocked use, this is another minor point to watch out for (or to watch out for if you later resell the phone.)", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone at a great price", "Author": "Oldtimer", "ReviewID": "R3A08A3RF8T7IN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son wanted a slider phone with a qwerty keyboard for texting, and this one turned out to be great (as was the price).  He had previously used a Gravity phone, and it was fine, but it started flaking out after getting wet, so we ordered a Gravity 2, and it was a disaster -- pressing keys would often give either no response or a double response.  So we returned it and ordered this one. Very glad we did! Texting on this keyboard is great.  Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find phones with a proper qwerty keyboard instead of just a display type keyboard, so if you're interested in this type, the Pantech Crossover may be perfect for you, as it is for my son.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Little Powerhouse!", "Author": "J_88", "ReviewID": "RCH6LFFJAMKUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the phone and have been using it for a little over a week now.Let me go through a very informal review.Right off the bat you will notice that this phone is made of quality materials. The touch screen is perfect for the size of the phone and very responsive. The keyboard is very easy to use and easy to slide out on the go. Also I can verify that the phone is completely unlocked and very easy to use with any gsm providor that you choose. It only took me about 10 minutes to put the sim card in and call the service provider and within no time I was talking and texting.The camera on the phone isn't the greatest and has a hard time taking pictures in dark rooms, however, in a brightly lit room and in the daylite this phone takes surprisingly great pictures! I was surprised that some of the pictures that I took rivaled my 1080p digital camera.The webbrowser for this phone is EXCELLENT and the phone seamlessly connects to wifi signals. The phone has a great interface and I called the phone a little powerhouse because it is very fast.A side note: The phone comes with Android 2.2 Froyo which is excellent because you will experience no problems and have a very fast device. However if you feel like you would like to have the latest technology the phone is upgradeable for free to Android 2.3 gingerbread. IF YOU UPGRADE YOUR PHONE IT WILL RELOCK IT! I was able to pay a small fee from a website and the phone was once again unlocked. Android 2.3 makes the phone EVEN FASTER, and integrates some improvements to the voice command service.This is my first Smartphone and it is an excellent buy! 5/5 stars you will love it!", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cute little powerhouse", "Author": "larsona", "ReviewID": "R36D2J39DRB8VR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me be honest: I wasn't expecting much.My previous experience with Android would be the Kindle fire, or 4.0. I didn't really think that it would be good compared to my Windows Phone (Which I loved!). I knew that if you go into the history of Android, it's full of errors. The OS would be unstable. I would have to reboot (or pull out the battery). It would just be a nightmare.But after seeing all the other reviews, I made the decision to risk it. After more than three months of saving (I'm fourteen), I finally had the funds to cover both the product and the shipping (Which was stupid, because it would have been prime a few days later). I ordered it.The whole reason I needed a new phone was because the earpiece on mine no longer worked, and I ordered a mount on Amazon for my bike that ended up making my phone do a swan-dive to the pavement. So, I started calling the screen repair places... they basically give me the hint that my phone was totaled. So, I started looking for other options.After a few long days, I finally received the phone. I understood that it was unlocked and -- pay attention here -- updating the software WOULD re-lock it. Now, this wasn't any problem for me, because I already have AT&T.; It is a VERY good idea to update it to Gingerbread (and I'll tell you why a little bit later on), but beware that it will wipe everything -- including the unlock -- on the phone and put on the new phone software again.Opening the package, there was no SIM card. A good thing, but if this is your first GSM and you are in need of a SIM card this phone is not yours just yet. I needed to put a Micro-SD card in, because that is the memory for the phone. Other than a little bit inside the phone, you'll be fully reliant on that little guy.I turned it on, linked it to my Google Account, and I was off. First impressions? A little bit better than what I expected. It was definitely slow, but it was a little power-house. I liked the swipe! It was really easy to use.I installed a few apps to see what it would be like with the RAM. It was okay, but not the greatest.Then, I went to the Pantech website, and downloaded the package. It's really easy to find. Just Google \"Pantech\", then click support, then scroll down to \"Pantech Crossover\" on the left hand side.The process took about seven minutes, and if you have a slow internet connection, I will warn you now that it will take longer. Like I mentioned before, it will wipe all the data on your device. I strongly recommend that you charge it fully, then do the update. I linked it to my Google Account (again), and my first impressions? One word: AWESOME. The performance improved 500%, and even though I noticed that on power on, it takes a while to load your applications, it was a really good experience. Even though the screen seems really small, and I do not recommend the possibility of coming to this phone from a  tablet phone, I strongly recommend this phone to anyone!

I'M VERY PICKY. I prefer blackberries. I have to have a keyboard. Touchscreen only doesn't do it for me, I can't get it no matter how much I practice. I do love the features of a touch screen. So, I go for this. Honestly in pictures it looks OK... Once I opened the package, I was surprised! And even better in my hand! I will tell you it is a little heavier than any other phone I've had but you can FEEL the durability. It doesn't feel like some cheap plastic phone. The back goes on and stays on very well also. No glitches at all. Runs very fast and smooth.  I got my package around 5pm yesterday. I changed my battery fully and unplugged as soon as it was done. I've been texting non-stop, had a few phone calls. I've had WIFI running, gone on the web, downloaded apps and even played tetris. It's 7:15 am now and I've used my phone since I got it yesterday, don't ask about my sleep schedule! Lmao....Anyways, my point - THe battery life is AMAZING. I have 73% of my battery left. Not expecting that! IT ALSO CHARGED VERY FAST! I am also an AT&T; GOPHONE customer, I popped in my SimCARd and IT DID WORK. There IS a SIM card slot AND a memory card slot, YES! The sound through the phone calls is great, the camera IS A VERY  good quality! THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE...that does not bother me really but IT MAY bother you, the volume for playing music or ringtones, is a bit lower than a normal phone if you have a song at normal sound...Like say if you get a song from MYXER, you have the option to boost the sound level, DO IT! Because if you don't it'll be pretty low... As for the keyboard, the keys are SOFT buttons...I will admit it's a tiny bit aggravating that the UP arrow button that is right beside the M key...I accidently hit it a lot but Its not one of those things that's unavoidable, once you get used to your fingers going right in place, you shouldn't hit it. Ummm I can't really think of anything else that most people look for in a phone... IF you have any question feel free to ask, I don't check amazon a lot but I will def. try to answer....... But HONESTLY buy this phone from Amazon in case you don't like it bc Amazon has a fair return policy but this is without a doubt the best phone I have ever had and worth the DEAL of 71.99 !

His phone is like jamming a tablet PC in your pocket. I've had my share of full touch screen phones and when it comes to texting, I hate them. I don't have teeny tiny fingers to use a virtual keyboard and usually the processors are so slow I'm waiting to push the next key. Most folks complain that this phone needs a flash light app, and a flash function for the camera or a bigger screen. They need my brothers phone and a back pack to carry it in. If I want a photo that requires a flash for darker indoor use I'm not going to use a cell phone anyway. I have nice digital camera that does that pretty well. Now it is true I moved up from an LG800 to this phone which is like moving from stone knives and furs to the Imperial Deathstar, so my opinion is based on that. Is this the newest superwamadyne smartest smart phone on the planet? Nope probably not close. But I can say it is rugged, full featured, compact enough to fit in a belt holster and it doesn't feel cheap. These phones sold for $350.00 when they first came out. I got mine for around $70 bucks. I got it quickly, ordered a Straight Talk sim card for it, activated in about 2 minutes and I'm off and running. For a no contract phone service this phone is way ahead of the curve.

I mainly want to mention couple of minor features that were not talked about by other reviewers.I am not a heavy cellphone user, nor very savvy when it comes to the latest technology on cell phones, but I know exactly what features I would want my cell phones to have, or I should say, my cell phones MUST HAVE.Couple things I look for on a cell phone: clear talk quality on both speaker and headset, miss call/sms/mms reminder notification. Prior my decision to keep Pantech Crossover, I tried Sony Xperia U and Motorola Flipside, both phones have the miss call/sms/mms reminder notification but lack of clarity when using speaker and headset.  Pantech Crossover got the call clarity, however lack the miss call/sms/mms reminder notification.  The reason I kept Pantech Crossover because I was able to download an app from GooglePlay (free, you will need to have internet connection on your phone, I used WIFI) for the reminder notification.  However, keep in mind, there is no LED light on this phone, so the only reminder notification you will have to use is by vibration or sound or both.Aside from those 2 features, it's a very sold pone, bit bulky due to the sliding keypad.  The response time, both loading an app and touchscreen sensitivity, is slow, but I don't mind, it's Android 2.3 not 4.2.  I was able to upgrade to Gingerbread.  To upgrade to Gingerbread, you will have to download a file from Pantech website (done on your computer), also, I would suggest upgrade to Gingerbread before you set up your phone or download any app, because by upgrading, it will whip out everything on the phone, except the contacts on your SIM.I have ATT, so I don't know if the phone was locked again after the upgrade. Overall, the phone is easy to use, it's a good transition phone from an old fashioned phone to a complete touchscreen phone.----Apps that I have downloaded from GooglePlay, all free:-Silent Toggle Widget - One click to set you phone to ring, vibrate, or silent.  Unlike other phones I had used in the past, Pantech Crossover only has either vibrate or complete silent if press the volume key all the way down-Ringdroid - assigns ringtones and edit your ringtones; your mp3/ringtones have to be on the microSD card-ES Task Manager - closes unused apps to save battery-Missed Message Flasher - reminds me any missed calls or text", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "pantech crossover", "Author": "dwest", "ReviewID": "R1I0FQI9NHR3N7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product met and exceeded expectations.

I read about this from other reviewers and am assuming that the seller poaches the cards when they unlock them. However, as the phone is being sold as new, I contacted the seller to let them know about the missing card. They responded immediately and offered two choices to rectify the matter- return for full refund, or keep and receive a partial refund (which I chose. )In the end the phone and purchasing an SD card from a local retailer was well within my budget, and feels like I got a great deal for exactly what I wanted.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too many issues...", "Author": "Rich Rich", "ReviewID": "R29U3N1OH8YDJ6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone has several flaws...(a) The advertised battery life is false -- instead of 5 hours of talk time, prepare for 3 -- also the standby time of 19 days is more like 3 days.  Maybe Pantech tests their phones in a timeless vacuum...(b) I am unable to find a headset to use with this phone -- I've tried 2 and as soon as you plug the headset in it starts the music player.  I've disconnected the music player and removed the music on the phone and now when I plug in a headset, the phone disconnects the call!  Also, if you want to use ear buds and then talk into the phone (like a walkie talkie) that is impossible as well.(c) Sometimes the phone will freeze up during a text and then you are forced to turn it off or remove the battery.(d) If you want to use a favorite song as a ring tone or as a wake up alarm -- you can't.(e) The phone comes with the setting of \"data off\" -- so when people start sending you texts with photos, be prepared to not see what they are sending you.  Instead you'll waste time trying to download the image only to get an error message that says unable to download.  This will make you think there is something wrong with your phone.  Instead, wade into the innards and turn the data setting on.(f) The user's manual that came with phone is a joke -- it looks like a beginners reader for kinderg\u00e4rtners.  Don't expect too much from it.(g) Both AT&T; and Google have put a bunch of junk on the phone -- all of it comes started by default,  So you will be wading through all of that to try and make the phone battery last.(h) The Android operating system is kind of a pain in the butt -- it's three steps to accomplish anything.  I can see why people prefer the Apple phone or a basic stick phone.(i) All that said, there are good points to the phone (the keyboard makes texts easier), but if you want to use your phone foremost to make calls and send texts, there are easier devices out there.Hope this helps!", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Youtube Lies", "Author": "R.

So please remember to give it 20 mins or so to warm up after u turn it on the 1st time just stick it in your pocket.SELLER: 4 stars for stealing the micro SD cards out of the box that comes factoryTIPS: This phone does not come with a feature to have a costume ringtone but dont back out on it there is an app I found called RINGDRIOD that helps with that as long as the song you want is on your micro sd card. Also battery life is great but if you want to keep it that way download ES TASKMANAGER and install the widget so u can tap it once and close all your apps you can also set it up to close apps when screen is off. Also if you are like me and only use it on wifi download an app called APN onoff to turn off the 3g to save you from using data.Features: speaker phone gets 4 stars from me because it does cut out on occasion. Key board 5 stars very responsive. Touch screen 4 stars could get 5 but still feel there could be some improvement on response. Browsing 3 stars could be a quicker for price range but still decent speed. App speed 4 stars good for price range but takes forever to load angry birds.

It worked immediately when I put the SIM card from her old phone in. Even though it is small, the screen resolution is sharp. The keyboard is easy to use. The on-screen keyboard is rather small, but the SWYPE feature is far more accurate than on the Samsung phone. The 512mb of internal storage lets you download a multitude of apps. I haven't found one yet that doesn't work on this phone. The camera is auto-focus, not fixed, so it will read bar and QR codes. It has a lot of AT&T; apps preloaded, some didn't work with T-Mobile but I was able to download similar ones from Google Play. I like this phone so much that I ordered one for myself.UPDATE 1/18/14: I'm finding a few apps not compatible with this phone (notably Candy Crush Saga) Keep an app killer handy as it does tend to bog down when running several apps.

My daughter downloaded all the games and apps she wanted from marketplace and because I already have a skype account and phone# I just added it to this phone... so as long as there is a Wifi connection, this phone does all I need it to with no sim or service plan!! I added a wifi texting app too...  Skype works works just as well as my cellular phone. The Wifi on this is faster and better than my high end Amaze and the sound is better too.

Battery life stinks, at least compared to my simple, non-smart phone, though I gather this is true of most smartphones.2. The highest the ring volume goes is way too low to be heard anywhere where there is any noise.3. It is incredibly slow, even for a person who is not used to the fastest computer or coolest smartphone.4. The screen often goes black for no apparent reason, and I have to slide the keyboard back and forth or do something else to get it back.5.

Second of all there's no instructions, only a piece of paper that shows you have to put the phone together and that's it, it has no sim card you can use your existing 1 or you have to buy 1 But overall it seems to be a good phone and I'm enjoying it, it's also my first smartphoneThe phone can be used with AT&T; or T Mobile (I have AT&T;)EDIT:Okay first of all I written a completely detailed review but due to an Amazon error it got wiped out. And typing is not my best thing sobut I'll type it all againFirst of all I'm gonna say this once if you've got a samsung galaxy s3 or fancy 500 dollar iPhone you'll be disappointed in all the features this phone has to offerOkay I upgraded from an lg cu 920 this was considered a feature phone or some people call it dumb phonesFirst off I set the phone can be used with T Mobile. This isn't completely accurate this phone will only use T Mobile old 2g network. You can still make calls text messages and use the internet but there is no 3g internet service.And also let you know that there is a version upgrade available for Android. but doing so will lock the phone to AT&T;'s network even if you been using T Mobile, you won't be able to use T Mobile after the Android upgrade. It is possible to root the phone to regain access to T Mobile. but if you don't know a lot about phones then you're pretty well out of luck and I don't know if you can downgrade once you upgraded. Factory resetting the phone won't restore the old version of Android.Now the GPS.I've used GPS and it's been accurate no problems with it. But still is not as accurate as a stand alone GPS. But for me it's good enough for turn by turn directionsNow the touch screenThe touch screen is been accurate for my BIG fingers. But sometimes it acts up and just randomly put stuff in text messages and your typing on the touch screen and it just goes haywire. I find that cleaning the screen just by breathing on it and wiping With your shirt will stop that problem. Until the screen becomes dirty again and I highly suggest you keep your hands clean went touching the screen.The screen has some great picture from my old phone, but you'll be disappointed if you're used to a iphone screen. The definition is not as good and the screens a bit smaller then an iPhone but the same size as my old phone. So I'm use to itBattery lifeCompare to my old phone battery life on this phone is. i say it's poor. I only talk maybe 5 minutes on my phone a day. I use GPS maybe once or twice a week, but I didn't find in to drain my battery like people complain it does, and the GPS runs for 30 minutes at a time. The screen brightness, I turned mine down halfway and for me it saves a good bit of better life since my screen is on moes of the day and I can still see the phone even and direct daylight. I listen to music at hours at a time at least 5 or 6 hours at 1 time and find out even with my headphones plugged in directly into the phone it barely drains the battery, now using my wireless Bluetooth headphones it drains more battery, a little noticeable but not much. And I use wifi on the phone for 4 to 6 hours a day and send maybe 200 text messages a day. But the real battery drain on this phone is the cellular antenna what connects it to AT&T; or T Mobile if you want to save battery life cut airplane mode on, but doing so what disable your ability to receive or make calls. Send and receive text messages and data communication over cellular, you can cut WiFi and Bluetooth back on and the cellular disabled. The battery life is good for me.Now the cameraMy old phone took some gorgeous picture where I was able to run to Walmart get special photo paper for my printer print it out get a frame from the dollar store frame it and it looked like a professional did it. But this phone supposed to have a better camera on it so I thought even better pictures. But shockingly it take some blurry photos. I'll continue messing around with the camera settings to see if I can find something that works better and when I do I'll post them back on hereRecording video completely destroys my old phone. It records much better video than my last phone which is shocking. But doesn't record video or take pictures like a good real smartphone.The way this thing takes video, you install apps and everythingI recommend you get a memory card. at least 8GB. The phone supports up to a 32 gigabyte memory card.AT&T; still pre loaded the phone with a bunch of junk full, Useless apps that you can't uninstall. but you can refuse to update them and save your memory. And a little tip some apps won't automatically put them self's on the memory card your have to do that yourself and you can save yourself even more memory that way.Durability now. I've dropped the phone a couple times but no scratches no signs of damage of wear and tear. Even with sliding the phone open and shut there's no signs of wear and tear.This phone has some hits and misses. And even if I knew all the problems with the phone before I even bought it I would still buy it again. this phone is a huge step up of my old phone.

Inserted my T-mobile SIM card and I can confirm that the phone is definitely unlocked.No data plan and I haven't installed the Android Gingerbread update yet so I cannot comment on that but currently, the phone is glitchy at times. GPS function does not appear to be working half the time which is a big nuisance for me since I like having GPS to track my runs. One time I had both the music player and a run tracking app running and the phone froze for over an hour even though the music was still playing and the GPS was still running. Had to take out the battery. Also, I can receive calls while I'm running but the person on the end is never able to hear what I'm saying while I hear them perfectly. Not sure if these issues persist because a) I haven't updated the phone, b) the gps/apps I'm running interfere with phone function, c) using t-mobile on AT&T; phone or d) phone is just glitchy. The camera quality is OK. There is long pause before the picture is taken as well as a loud shutter noise.Otherwise I like this phone. Very sturdy and doesn't feel cheap. I can use most of the apps I use on my iPod Touch even though I still prefer my iPod touch since everything is much faster and runs more smoothly on there.

I downloaded about 20 apps and never had an issue with storage space.-I also found the battery life adequate--never great, as in virtually all androids, but always adequate.-Everything else works.  It never froze or anything.Cons:-The camera is pathetic.  Without a flash, it exposes the lens way too long, and unless your subject is perfectly still, it will be fuzzy.  There is also a very long shutter lag.-The screen is not terribly responsive.  Quite often I had to try a few times before it would notice a gesture.  It is also telling that when slowly scrolling down to read something, it would shimmy.I will also mention a couple of things that are not quite cons but I found a little annoying:-It was at first quite annoying that the home and menu buttons are hardware buttons, but the back and search buttons are touchscreen.  Who thought of that?  For the first couple of months, I was constantly pushing too hard on the back, or too soft on the home or menu.  I eventually got used to it, though.-I got this phone for the keyboard, since I am used to blackberry typing.  While there is nothing wrong with the slider keyboard, I found that even after several months, it was just as slow as typing on a touch screen.  There is something about the long, skinny layout, where your thumbs have to travel a ways, that makes a slider less effective.

Before I get into that I'd recommend the Samsung Flight I.Anyway first off this phone is very responsive which you'd think would be a good thing but the problem is its way to responsive whether its the touchscreen or the buttons you'll often find yourself pressing things you don't want to, mostly the search and back buttons since you barely have to touch them.Even the keyboard is too sensitive you'll press one key and more often than not it will also press one or two keys next to it. And one more thing about the touchscreen you can't use it at all if your wearing gloves.Another annoying thing is the screen will constantly be turning on you, you'll want it to be vertical and it will go horizontal and vice-versa.Maybe this is just my phone but it won't download any picture messages.The applications are all scattered around and its not worth your time rearranging them, to be completely honest I'm not sure if you can, a couple examples of it is you'd think your camera app and gallery app would be right next to each other but they're not the gallery is down a couple rows and one to the right. Also instead of having one convenient app for all of your tools your tools are also scattered, the alarm clock is the very first one then the calculator is one down and three to the right, and its basically like that for all the tools.And then I guess I do have a couple minor good things about this phone the internet is usually pretty fast, but again with the really sensitive touchscreen its still really annoying to use. I haven't tested it myself but it does seem like it could take a beating for a few years until it finally gets totaled. The quality of the camera is 3.0 Mega-Pixels, which I suppose is fair enough. And lastly the battery life is again fair enough, but like most phones if you use the internet too much it can drain the battery pretty quickly.Lastly one more minor thing about the phone is that the charger port is in an awkward spot, its on the right side of the phone which is the same way the phone slides so it can be kind've weird using it while its charging.Overall it could be a good phone if it wasn't so sensitive and everything wasn't scattered, but because of it, it just makes the phone close to unusable.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great cheap phone", "Author": "David427", "ReviewID": "R1ON053PPE4XKD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought it as a temporary phone, like it but it is slow.

If it falls between those categories, I usually don't bother. Unfortunately for me, this was one that fell under the \"extremely bad\" category. A week after I bought this I would have easily given it a 4/5 star, with the star missing because of it being quite slow (even for the outdated processor). However after 3 months of owning this, I'm realizing how horrible of a device this really is. I bought this knowing it was outdated, and I take this into consideration with my review, but there are just too many negatives to give this a positive review whatsoever. This was only meant to be a 3-4 month replacement phone until I'm eligible for my new upgrade, but I'll be lucky to make it a few more weeks without using this thing as target practice.The Good:-Durable-Slide-out keyboard-I like the design-Decent battery-AffordableThe Bad:-Horribly slow, sometimes to the point of me sitting the phone down, and grabbing a snack or drink until it loads something as simple as my contacts page-The lock/power button is at a really dumb spot when trying to use the slide-out keyboard. I frequently lock (stand-by) my phone while texting-When using the touchscreen keyboard in portrait mode, for some reason it has virtually no ability to predict any text. What's worse is that it not only can't predict it, but it will try to change the most common of words into other words you don't want. It just doesn't have the common words in it's \"word bank\" so to speak. I literally had to add words like it, in, then (and multiple more).The Ugly:-Randomly shuts off quite frequently. Sometimes it will do it one time in 2 weeks, the next time it shut off 3 times in one day.-Almost every day now, I lose touch screen functionality in the upper half of the screen (in other words anything you try to press on in the top 50% of the screen will not respond). This makes the phone nearly useless.I seem to have the worst luck with phones. I've only had one half-decent phone out of my last 5 phones (and that one took a dive on the highway because I accidentally left it on the hood of my car), and this phone is BY FAR the worst one I have had.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent phone, but you get what you pay for", "Author": "Hoosteen", "ReviewID": "R1HJ6PM6J3CVQE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone looking for a, inexpensive Android device.

Didn't die until after several days of light usage.-Good call quality.-Very solid, rugged feel.-QWERTY keyboard buttons, though flat, have a good feel to them and were pretty intuitive.What I didn't like:-This thing is hefty.-Sluggish performance. Live wallpapers and downloading apps cause massive slowdown. I tried streaming Netflix to this device and found it to be too much of a pain due to its low frame rate.-Unresponsive screen. You'll require several swipes to get through the different home screens. The unresponsive screen, combined with the sluggish performance, make menial tasks such as scrolling through menus a pain.This phone is meant to for those who are crossing over from feature phones to smartphones, but I fear that its slow performance and poor screen response would scare off this demographic.

Charged the battery, put my AT&T; SIM card in and I thought I was good to go. Was I wrong!! I had absolutely no service at all with this phone. The phone said service unavailable, but everything else worked great. Very frustrated, I went to my local AT&T; store and they looked at the phone and tried everything they could to get the service back to the phone. They even swapped my SIM card to multiple phones in the store and all the other phones worked fine. They said the term that \"This phone must be flashed or something because everything works fine but the service\". After driving nearly 80 miles round trip to find out that this phone is junk I immediately packed the phone back up and sent it back. Never again will I try buying an electronic device on Amazon. Nothing against Amazon, just mainly the seller. I would rather get the phone locally so I know it actually works.
