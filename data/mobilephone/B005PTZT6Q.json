I have been a very good Amazon customer and I am really disapointed that after buying so many things from them, I didn't get any help, a very good customer as I, should't be treated that way!At first when I inserted my Sim card I got a message asking for a network code, but after trying many codes the message was gone and now I only get an Invalid Sim message, so now my only choice is to unlock it via software, so I have to pay an extra $35 to a store so my phone can be unlock via software, I just hope it works, otherwise I will have a very nice $500 mp3 player.So to resume don't buy this phone because it is NOT UNLOCKED and Amazon won't give you any help!At the end , there was no way to unlcok this phone, I tried everything and it wasn't posible!Also the phone was bought directly from Amazon.com LLC, not from a reseller.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "A masterpiece", "Author": "RKoston", "ReviewID": "R3Q1VRW1OWTARI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the DROID RAZR last week and I like it a lot. Previously i owned a Nokia X6, which is also a terrific phone but a little slow by modern standards. I ordered it by standard shipping from Best n Price and surprise surprise.. they sent it the next day.. which was GREAT. I was a little skeptical as this phone is without warranty and looked a little expensive. Now,ABout the Droid Razr -Razr = Gorilla Glass + Kevlar + 7.1mm thick (or should i say SLIM) + 8MP camera, no need to say more about the build. Its nearly perfect.The Razr is pretty fast and the iphone looks dwarf as compared to this. The interface is also customized and pretty cool with the 5 home screens moving in a 3D. Apps on the Homescreens can be resized, removed by a quick hold and flick of the finger (Home screens are just too cool). Android phones are all about apps and there are plenty of cool and useful apps to be downloaded from the android market which is a great asset.MOTOCAST -I found Motocast, the software that can sync the Droid Razr and ur laptop, pretty interesting. In the beginning it takes sometime to get used to, but once u know how it works, makes just freakin cool to download and watch, listen anything thats on my laptop ANYWHERE, yes, ANYWHERE provided the laptop is ON.SMART ACTIONS -Yes, this is one of the most useful app in Moto Droid Razr. Customize and make own schedules to switch on Wifi, save battery by dimming brightness when not charging, change the ringtone volume, modify screen timeout automatically. All this works in a Trigger and Action fashion which is easy to understand and conserves a lot of manual effort. AWE***SOMEI tried skype on Wifi, video was great without lag but a little echo in sound. Processes and Tasks can be monitored with pre-installed apps, which I like to do even on my laptop.BATTERY-Yes, it takes you through a day easily but needs charge in the night.With all my daily tasks like Calls , Chatting (almost Whole day), browing in the evening or whenever i get time I can easily squeeze 12 -14 hrs from the Moto Droid Razr and be still left with 20% of the battery. Definitely a continuous use can drain it in 8 hrs. but the charging time is 1.5 hrs (Pretty less)SIGNAL STRENGTHI read in a review that the MOTO Razr can catch a signal in the most remote areas and the worst places. Voila, thats just what I wanted, I work in a place where I never used to get signal, but Droid Razr catches almost 3 - 4 bars. Sometimes it searches for the signal but very rarely. This is one of the best things about this Razr. Even the iphone (or any others I have seen with my colleagues) with a better service provider catches only 1-2 bars.PROS - Big screen, Connectivity, Build, Motocast, Smart actions, Interface, Cool Apps, Sound, Calls, Fastest shipping I have seenCONS - OS 2.3.5 (need the latest one ICS), No Micro SD card (with this model), Battery (could have been better), No warrantyI never write long reviews but this one deserves it.Simply said.. THIS is a great phone and worth every penny. I love my Razr.Edit:I received the ICS upgrade (Europe version) last evening and its been working great (I am in US). This phone is amazing after the ICS upgrade. Just a little heads up to anyone who is going to upgrade to ICS, the process (download and install) might take long (between 30 min to 2.5 hrs) but it will eventually upgrade and start the phone. My phone looked like it was stuck on \"Starting Applications\" screen for 2 hours but it finally worked and I am on ICS now.The RAZR just got a whole lot better. I will also recommend using the GO Launcher EX from Android market, it makes this phone simply awesome.More Update after 2 days of ICS use. I will keep this short -Pros:1. Better Battery Life (Under same conditions, earlier I used to have 40% at the end of day (10-11 hrs), now I was left with 60%)2. Amazing UI and the phone interface simply looks great. The whole experience is more Fluid.3. Feels more faster, i think there have been performance improvements.Cons:1. Task Manager is gone. There is no Default Task Manager. (Third party ones can be downloaded)2. Signal Strength has dropped one bar. (Still Its much better than a lot of major brand phones, my colleagues complain about signal loss, while i still enjoy signal in those places)TIP: Some people have complained that they cannot find option to ENABLE/DISABLE Background Data. The \"Restrict Background Data\" option is present in \"Data Usage\" Settings when options Key is pressed on the phone.(There is a bug while controlling this through Smart Actions, I encountered it once)Overall, from my viewpooint, they addressed major issues of battery life (i never had an issue here), better UI, higher performance. So, ICS is definitely recommended for Razr.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great but for a few flaws", "Author": "Alexander Collins \"Alex\"", "ReviewID": "RB59P1RBIKV38", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After about 3 weeks of use I've found this to be have quite a few shortcomings out of the box. With the help of a few apps and customizations it's turning out to be a great phone.PROS:1. Great display - great cross between tablet and phone. Great for watching videos.2. Extremely responsive touch3. Very fast4. Slim design and light - not too light as some suggest. I added a good case which made it a tad heavier and a bit more comfortable in the hands.5. Comes with a good deal of useable apps6. Pretty good camera - works well at night and very well during the day7. Decent video in the dark... haven't yet checked the daytime recording8. Good quality sound with headphones9. Motorola's Motocast software is great for accessing media from different computers. Once the software is installed on the relevant computers files can be accessed as long as all computers and phone have internet access. Greatly reduces the need to store files on the phone itself.10. Contact management is a breeze once contacts are available though an internet source11. Very useful widgets out of the boxCONS:1. Battery life is extremely short when gaming and using media (music, videos and such). There are a some good solutions I've found like using a very dim display brightness which helps tremendously but battery life is still very disappointing2. The default Android 2.x keyboard is unbelievably disappointing. Except for the fullstop simple things such as question marks and single uplifted commas have to be accessed by using the '?123' button. The keyboard layout isn't customizable so that unused keys can be replaced. Also, ten keys have a different long press function, the numeric keys. All others have nothing for long presses. How dumb is it to put simple stuff like question marks and commas in a separate screen and have about sixteen other keys with nothing for long presses?!3. Screen cannot be set to time out without requiring a slide to unlock. Don't know if I missed something but as much as I've tried once the display times out, I'm required to slide to unlock. Sometimes I just want the display off without a need to slide all the time4. Home screens cannot be removed or added5. Multi-tasking is un-intuitive except for the help of an app. Difficult to switch between running apps or to even see what's running. Thankfully that was fixed with an app.6. Have found that the touch becomes unresponsive occasionally. This hasn't happened often but when it does it's extremely annoying. Once I attempted to swipe to answer a call and it wouldn't repsons. Had to hit the power button before it responded.7. No recording software out of the box8. Boasts 16GB of storage with a 16GB micro SD card included but actually has 8GB usable storage and I got no micro SD card with mine (Unlocked version)9. Speaker leaves some to be desired10. Adding offline contacts  is too difficultThat's all I can think of for now. Hopefully there will be a software update to address some of the issues mentioned above but still a good and fun phone. No regrets buying this one.JUNE 5th Update as requested:A couple more CONS of note:11. I is indeed ridiculous to have had paid over US$500 for the phone and it came without a warranty. Even if it is an international version.12. Where the options for the image galleries are many, for music playback it is very limited. Music files in the file browser cannot be added to playlists, even a currently playing queue. Also, when multiple music files are selected from the file browser, the only options are 'Download' and 'Open' and open opens a single file. Finally, no option to sort music by location.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice phone, very light, bad speaker, micro SIM", "Author": "Laoblue", "ReviewID": "R35IWOLEDOEPUS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this phone and paid 680 USD.  Prices are falling, so if you wait a bit it should be cheaper.  The one I got appears to be an \"import\" from the UK.  A couple of complaints:  not so good single speaker on the back which sounds plastic-like similar those cheap clear-membrane loudspeakers, but headphones are better.  And, the battery life is very short if you play games or watch movies.  I have to charge it everyday.  Hopefully, Moto will get enough complaints about the battery life and design a better battery for future phones.  It takes the micro SIM, so I had to cut my old one to \"fit\" into the smaller slot - I did not want to change my number and micro SIMs are a bit harder to find in China.  Overall, a good phone, thin and light to carry, and wide screen (I can't imagine what the Galaxy S2 LTE HD at 4.65 feels like - huge maybe in comparison).  Video in low light is good, but nothing to write home about.  So, you will pay a premium for a skinny mobile and keep the charger with you...

Motorola USA won't change/check battery even for $", "Author": "Kev", "ReviewID": "R3EQLI4A93IEDT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "(I did not purchase this phone through Amazon, but my experience is relevant to any US purchaser.) I purchased this phone in May in SE Asia from a leading dealer. It has a \"local\" warranty, and that, unfortunately, seems to be the norm.Late August, I started losing battery in 1-3 hours instead of the previous 4-8 hours, and the battery now goes from 50% to 5% (and off) in only a few minutes!I'm in the US now for a couple of months, so I contacted Motorola Support to arrange to have the phone checked and maybe have the battery changed. First rep (Brian on \"LiveChat\") said it was possible the phone would be returned unrepaired, since it's identified by the IMEI as a Singapore phone. Later I realized the rep had misunderstood, that I was offering to pay for the repair/change if necessary. So I contacted them again and chatted with Romella. She said Moto USA would be able to work with it, probably at no charge, since it was under warranty. Great, I thought. She said Moto repair would call the next day with an RMA and instructions.The phone powered off the moment I tried to accept their call this morning. I called back and spoke first with \"Michael\" in repair (he sounded Indian), and he put me on hold 5-8 times, and the call took 45 minutes just trying to find out what repair had tried to call me about. He reported that Moto USA wouldn't touch the phone, no matter how much money I was willing to pay. He escalated me to Felicia (sp?), who sounded as though in the US.Felicia told me that XT912s (Verizon's RAZR) are made in the US (!) and they are the only RAZRs that Motorola USA ([...]) can service at any price. I asked her what I should do about changing the battery, since the design does NOT allow consumers to open the battery compartment. She said I should send it to Singapore, since the warranty was there. I reiterated that I wanted to pay to have it done here quickly and that I understood that the warranty did not cover use of the phone in the US. She repeated that I had to send it to Singapore, since they have no idea what an XT910 is in the US, have different software, etc.XXX I'm sending it to Singapore tomorrow and will need to get a temp. handset, since I'll probably lose the phone for several weeks and will probably have to pay a fortune in shipping. Times like this I regret the MicroSIM as well.I would NOT recommend this phone or any other Moto phone without user changeable battery, unless you are buying it from Verizon, with Verizon's insurance, to use in the US only. Moto is very provincial and seems to have a deal with Verizon to pretend that Moto is just a subsidiary of Verizon in the US. What a joke.I wish I'd heeded friends' advice to get an iPhone or a Samsung. For that matter, I noticed that Sony's US website offers direct sales of unlocked phones with US warranties (as well as AT&T; and other locked ones). While these appear to be US-only warranties, bad for travel outside the US, it would seem that I could have bought a Sony in Asia and at least gotten out-of-warranty service for the phone here in the US, if I'd needed it. Apple also has direct sales of unlocked iPhones.Maybe Moto Sing will make my day and turn-around quickly and not charge much for shipping back to the US. If so, I promise to share the good news here. 2 months ago, the phone was a 3-4 star item in my eyes. With no battery, and no way to change it in the US, it's a 0-1 star. Goodbye Motorola.***It gets worse: US Postal Service, Fedex, and UPS will NOT ship the phone with its lithium-ion battery from US to Singapore. It's deemed hazardous. So, Moto US won't open the phone and test the battery; instead they say to send it to Singapore. But no one will send it to Singapore. I'm sick of dealing with Motorola ... Lesson: Don't buy a phone with embedded battery unless one's sure the battery will be looked at by the same company's reps in another country.

I never had or wanted to have any phone bigger than 3.2\" till I saw the beauty of this RAZR ( & to be honest the GS2 in regard of being slim as well). The phone is a certain conversation starter, looks really cool, well built and definitely not cheap ( and it isn't!)The very new HTC one is bragging to be one of the slimmest phones, well, as slim as it is, it is still bigger than the RAZR!Have been checking most of the phones that are appearing in the market and none could beat the beauty of the RAZR IMO.-the speed: added tons of apps and games, no sweat!-Battery: dunno what other reviewers expected from a phone with such a processor, screen & 4G but this needs power! My last 4 smartphones' batteries (in 5 years) couldn't last more than a day, so this one is no surprise. add Juice defender app and it helps u go through the day with moderate use. Some days I talk too much and play too much this is when I need to charge it twice a day, I have a portable external battery that I got off e-bay for around $10. It works fine and is really small.Easier to carry even in pocket.Despite that I actually took one star off cos of the battery and lame camera..at this price range I still expected more from the battery and definitely a more stable cam.

I gave this magnificent smartphone 4 stars instead of 5 because of the internal storage deception.  To some people it may not be a big deal considering their implementation of MotoCast (I'll come back to that).  When I researched the specs, it was advertised to have had 16GB of internal storage not including the micro-sd expansion capabilities.  However, I got the phone and hooked it up to my MacBook Pro it stated only 8GB of internal storage.  Not a deal breaker but I would have thought something like this would have been stated in a review of some kind.  The Andoid system & OS takes up that much space lol?  Ok, whatever.I previously primarily used the Nokia N8.  The hardware is great in my opinion but the Symbian OS simply can't compare to any Apple or Android OS.  There's a reason Nokia joined with Windows.  After having the Motorola Xoom for several months I  became greatly impressed by the OS.  I figured I would check out what I've been missing in terms of smartphone OSs and purchase my first Android driven smartphone.  The user interface is pretty easy to get accustomed to.  If loading your device with apps is your thing then Market has more than enough.  I've found a ton of useless applications but my fair share of relevant apps.The physical appearance of the Droid Razr is definitely a conversation starter.  Even the iphone fanboys can't help but ask about it.  I've yet to actually take it apart to see how easily the battery can be accessed but that may come in a later review (who knows).  The screen resolution is superb in my opinion.  If I recall correctly the Nokia N8 has a 3.5\" screen.  The difference between that and the Droid Razr is more than noticeable.  I've gotten use to the size difference.  I've read reviews about this device being difficult to manipulate with one hand.  I haven't really had this problem.  My hands aren't really all that big but I can hold it single-handedly with no problem.I'm still patiently waiting for an Android version of VLC player.  I'm utilizing MX video player on both the Xoom and Razr.  They work great with avi files but still has a problem with mkv files.  I'm sure I'll continue to have this problem as long as VLC for Android is in production.  MotoCast is pretty cool.  The setup is painless believe it or not.  The streaming capabilities are pretty nice in my opinion.  This program is definitely resourceful.The Nokia N8 has a pretty nice camera.  The camera on the Droid Razr isn't as nice but the difference isn't that noticeable.  I did manage to try out the HD video recording.  Let's just say it works well enough.  I mean, I would be pretty disappointed if it was subpar considering the price you pay for this smartphone.Overall, I'm pretty satisfied.  The design and physical appearance are great.  The OS is definitely an upgrade over what I've been use to (and this isn't even the infamous ICS that it's supposed to receive).  Would I recommend this device?  I sure would.  I also recommend you do your research; perhaps on the Droid 4.0, Galaxy Nexus, Note, and iPhone.  Then take your pick.

I would have preferred the top/bottom not to curve in but no biggie.  Gorilla glass is excellent and seems to do a much better job of keeping clean unlike Iphones I see with disgusting oil streaks smeared across them.  Display is larger than Iphone but image quality is slightly lower than the iphone.  The sim card door flap is a disappointment.  It feels weak and cheap unlike the rest of the phone.Touch responsiveness:  Excellent and effortless.  Rarely does the touch/swipe skip a beat.  I have had the phone overloaded on a task and the touch started to skip but 99% of the time it works great and is very responsive.The connection:  I got an android for the 4G and flash.  Flash is pretty useless since hulu does not allow android to connect but the 4G is excellent.  I rarely drop to 3g and the Verizon 4g is very fast.  This phone also allows tethering and it works well.  I do notice a little slowdown versus a dedicated 4g wifi hotspot device but it's close enough.I haven't done a lot of phone calls but based on what I hear from other Verizon owners ATT is awful and plagued with drops calls (i've experienced this on the other end of an ATT call) but the verizon is solid.The Android experience:  Excellent for the most part.  I've experienced gas buddy crashing, google marketplace crashing and I've only used it less than a week.  Not sure if it is the antivirus I installed.  Handset locked up during a call and since the battery is non-removable there is apparently a reset hole on the back of the phone.  That's kind of embarrassing.Moving and storing files is a no brainer.  Phone shows up as a removable drive on windows.  You simply copy/paste to the Razr like a thumb drive.Playing Movies was a pleasant surprise.  NO CONVERSIONS REQUIRED!  Just copy the .avi and use my files app to play the movie.  Makes Iphone look foolish along with the lack of 4g.Built in speaker is a bit weak but I use a headphone anyways.GPS works great and offers different routes / times based on traffic conditions.  Turn by turn navigation and voice command makes regular gps useless.Motorola SmartActions is very useful.  I set a rule for 12:00 AM - 6:10 AM to turn off most all the phone features.  Then during work hours I set GPS/Bluetooth off and set the phone to vibrate.  All of that is automatic and extremely useful.  I'd hate to do that manually everyday.So here are the 3 complaints so far.Application stability.  Too many crashes/1 phone lockup.Unable to remove battery (why copy apple on this horrible feautre?)battery life has to be babied to be worthwhile (have to turn off GPS/Bluetooth/Wifi/4g antenna (using the 3g/4g app).", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Could have been a great phone but there are major flaws.", "Author": "Ben Shomer", "ReviewID": "RTJS0H4BNNB2C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "At first glance this is a remarkable piece of equipment.

Night photography, as expected, is somewhat ill, but that is general to any phone.Most smartphones are heavy power consumers, but this one is dreadful! It never lasted more than 3-4 hours in standby even when it was new! The original battery pack is way too expensive relative to other batteries on the market. Replacement (non Motorolla) batteries interfere with some functionalities of the phone (especially the GPS unit).The phone is sealed, which means you cannot take the battery out when the operating system becomes jammed. In such situations, the warm reset button combination (both volume keys and power pressed together) doesn't always work.

In IOS the unknown album sector is only for that artist, in the razrs music app that sector is for every freaking song that has no assigned album. So it becomes a real pain making playlists.Apart from that ive experienced no nuisances with the phone and some of my friends are even contemplating buying one. its that amazing.i seriously recommend this phone, dont let reviews talking about how big it is sway you from getting it, i myself was worried, but when i got it i realized they were all just exaggerating or probably have TREX hands.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone!

Once I updated the phone to its most recent version, all the problems I had were gone...actually, the only problem that I had is when the phone's camera crashed and can't start up anymore, and the home screen getting out of the viewable area of the screen of my phone. After the update, it's all gone. Everything is working normally, as it should be.There aren't any included Micro SD Card, so I had to buy one for that.No warranty, although I'm not that clumsy anyway.Very light, lighter than the iPhone.Very thin, even with a case; it's still thin. I used a case made by Spigen.It's fast too! It can browse and handle tasks better than my iTouch. I actually had to scream at it, because I never realized how slow it was.I can't create a very good review about the camera though. My previous phone, which was also my first phone, is a Motorola V3i, has a very sucky quality when comparing it at this age. In short, I don't have any other phones to make a comparison, but I thought the video and picture quality is great.Sound is very loud! I mean the built in stereo. It has a future to be my alarm clock, or at least let me hear the person talk loud enough when I'm using the speakerphone during calls. Played a music with it, crystal clear. Made a call, same thing. I never thought the day would come where I don't have to keep saying \"what?\"HDMI, USB, and headphone jack is all at the top of the phone...not a very good place in my opinion, but I guess it's the only place they can go.Lastly, the battery life. Without utilizing the Droid Razr's Smart Action feature, I would be charging the phone every night even when I'm not using it. It has always been the problem of the Razr, so I'm pretty used to it dying really fast, but to others, things could get frustrating...especially when you're in the zone.All-in-all, I love it. It has its pros and cons, but I think it's worth the price. UNLOCKED too! That means I can travel with my baby...the problem would be its SIM. It uses a micro SIM instead of the regular SIM.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Droid Razr", "Author": "Cesar Pulgar", "ReviewID": "R2KWRSJ8RBI691", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The shipping service was excellent, the product purchased motorola razr droid I think is one of the best teams in the world right now.

You gotta like it before buying it in order to love it. Firsts days the battery died pretty quick but once you get used to get the most out of it it can hold the day with decent usage.

The screen can be as bright as you want but for battery life is better to have it very dim. Signal and data transfer works fine, also the hot spot app is very easy to use and can be used while taking a call. Everything at the same time.

My roommate has the Galaxy SII, purchased around the same time, and they're very comparable, though obviously from different carriers.  Places the SII shines- the screen resolution and the camera are better.  The difference in the picture quality is most noticeable in less than perfect lighting situations.  In good outdoor light, the Droid's camera is wonderful.  Further, outdoor videos are crisp and clear.  The Samsung's camera outshines in indoor situations though, and it's noticeably better.  The screen resolution is better on the SII, but that's not really something you could ever tell unless you had the image, with a lot of detail, displayed side by side; it's not a functional advantage.Places the Droid excels are in software and build quality.  The Motorola software is really progressive, and just works.  DLNA connectivity of WiFi from a remote location (not just a home network) is awesome, and I can't believe they're the only ones doing it.  It's their MotoCast software, and it's insanely convenient and kind of a \"duh\" feature.  Smart actions is very cool, too- you create rules for the phone; ex, if I'm in this location (say school or work, via GPS trigger), turn the ringer to vibrate and the background data (email) on, and change the walpaper from a picture of my adorable to labrador to something more professional, and my ringer from my favorite song to something more business appropriate.  It works, consistently, and it's awesome.The hardware on this phone is unsurpassed, or even paralleled.  The steel chasis and gorllia glass make a HUGE difference.  I am hard on phones.  That's an understatement, I'm brutal on phones.  I work at a large capacity equine clinic and have to have my phone on me at all times.  My phone spends equal time in my back pocket, in the cupholder on a tractor, or in the bottom of some stall some where.  I have a basic TPU case on in and a screen protector, both of which are showing some wear, but the phone is unscathed.  I don't believe any over competitive smartphone on the market could come close to this durability.  This is why I decided on this phone, and have not been disappointed in the slightest.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Motorola razr worse phone ever.", "Author": "R. Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R3SMA2W1CU8CNL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have only bought Motorola Phones ever since the original razr came out. I have loved them and never had a problem with any of there phones till now. I have had this phone for 5 to 6 months its not old or anything. The phone isnt damaged never dropped or anything however started about 2 weeks ago my phone has lost battery life for no reason. The 4g is turned on i used to get it now i only get 3g and it doesn't stay on for long maybe 2 minutes at max then it trys to get a connection. The bars for voice calling used to have 5 now i get 2 maybe 3. Verizon sent me a like new but already used phone that was worse then the one i own. The worse thing is when the phone dies from battery not being charged it takes 2 mins to get a connection to make a call.My brother also has this phone and yet his is perfectly fine and hes dropped his phone. His battery life is 1 and a half days while mine is 10 hours max it used to be the same as his he boots his phone off and turns it back on he has signal to make calls in 2 to 5 seconds but mine is 2 minutes. This is a joke phone do not buy it as its just garbage.Motorola has lost a customer for life I will never buy another Motorola product again.

Wanting 4G and not seeing it in a Blackberry, I thought I would give the new Droid Razr a go.  4G is definitely fast, the phone is rich with functions and the verbal input for navigation and texting is truly awesome.  The size of screen and resolution makes it easy to use; the voice command is almost worth it alone.However, after two days I couldn't stand it any more and returned it.I'll admit up front that I dislike touch screen phones. I had an iphone for a job and was happy to give it back when I left.  Using the screen lock means I have to perform no less than eight functions to access an application or use the phone to make a call.  Though most people like touch screens, so that's my individual preference.  However, the main reason I returned it is because it is HUGE! Its great when you're using it, but not when you're trying to be on the go. It didn't fit in my pants or coat pockets securely, nor did it fit in any of my car's holders.Other issues I had:1. Charging was slow (my Blackberry charges in 15 minutes, the Droid took almost an hour).  Battery duration seemed marginal. The MAXX version is available for another $100; apparently that is amazing battery performance.2. I lost the data connection and had to reboot on day two.3. It turned off and would not turn back on until I was in the store and they showed me two special keys to power it up (not the normal power keys).4. The ringtones are awful - adding new ones was a hassle and then I wasn't able to control the alarm ring tone.5. The button on the side to initiate the phone after it has turned the display off is a pain. I couldn't operate it with the pad of my finger, I had to use my finger nail, which meant taking more time and not being able to do it with one hand.If you can see past the size and like touch screens, I'm sure you'll like it. The screen size and performance was great, the features rich and it is very easy to use. Can't beat Motorola quality either.
