{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Rough Around the Edges but Huge Potential", "Author": "Guest", "ReviewID": "R3NB23ZAPCL7Q0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Review Updated June 1, 2010=======================Design & Hardware=======================[CONSTRUCTION]: The surface of the N900 is a smooth black matte finish. The build material is aluminum, steel and rubber/plastic. The N900 easily fits in a pocket, being smaller than the N810 but noticeably thicker than most phones. The four front components are the status light, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, and VGA camera. There is a consumer infrared port (universal remote), wrist strap option, stylus and kickstand. The removable back contains the main camera, SIM, battery and microSDHC slot. Removal requires some strength but it's reassuring knowing it won't fall off.[KEYBOARD]: The keyboard is side-sliding with a smooth, springless mechanism providing a solid feel. The keyboard is three-row, localized and backlit with rubberized key surfaces. The keys are more difficult to use than devices with rounded keys but are still easier than virtual keyboards. While reaching speeds of 35-40 WPM is realistic, extended use is rather tiring. It is possible connect a USB or Bluetooth keyboard, gamepad, mouse and even a Wii Remote.[TV-OUT]: There is 480i resolution TV-out which uses an included 3.5mm jack with 4 rings. These are ground, audio left and right, and composite video. Useful for watching movies, playing games or doing work that requires a big screen.[SCREEN]: The 16 million color, 800x480 pixel display is incredible. It is pressure-sensitive, 15:9 aspect and transflective, making the screen easier to see in direct light. It uses a surprisingly responsive resistive touch screen allowing use with gloves, fingernails or a stylus. The ambient light sensor adjusts the brightness automatically. Lack of multi-touch means cumbersome \"swirling\" gestures in some software but is generally not a huge issue.[CAMERAS]: The main camera is a 5MP Carl Zeiss, the same as the Nokia N97. It comes with a sliding shutter to protect the recessed lens. There is also a front-facing 640x480 webcam. The camera interface is the same as the S60. The image quality is sharp, skin tones are vivid and there is very little, if any, chromatic aberration at the edges. The camera uses the accelerometer when photographing so the photo viewer can show the picture \"up\" however the N900 is held. Take a portrait picture and view it landscape and it'll be small. Turn the device and it'll fill the screen. There are the following modes: Automatic, Macro, Portrait, Landscape, Action, and Auto video. The camera can take 848\u00d7480 resolution video at 25 fps. The video quality is crisp, recording at an impressive 3000 kb/s but the framerate usually drops to 20fps and the audio has a noticeable metallic tone. The camera also works with Adobe Flash.[CPU]: The CPU is an ARM-based TI OMAP 3430 600MHz clocked at 500MHz but can be overclocked. Some users of the Maemo forums have managed to push it up to 1.2GHz. This allows improved performance with high resolution media, gaming/emulators and web browsing among many others. Overclocking requires downloading a modified kernel with the desired speed. They are generally made available in 50Mhz steps such as 800MHz and 850MHz. Then simply run fiasco-image-update on the download. While overclocking would normally reduce battery life, most kernels also provide underclocks for idle which allows the N900 to use significantly less power when not in use, the net result often being EXTENDED battery life. According to Nokia, overclocking does void the warranty. Since the N900 does not have any active cooling the heat created by overclocking could significantly shorten the N900's life if pushed too much. N900 units are unique, each will overclock differently. So far though the series does seem to overclock extremely well.[BATTERY]: The battery is a 1320mAh Nokia BL-5J, 22% smaller than the BP-4L. A full battery with unoptimized settings allows about 5-9 hours of continuous talk time, 5 hours of music or a few hours of 3G. 3G/3.5G drains the battery faster than Wi-Fi. Lowering brightness, removing desktop widgets and disabling GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and 3G easily triples battery life. Charging is through microUSB which takes about 4-5 hours for an empty battery. An issue with the USB port breaking off has been acknowledged by Nokia as a design oversight, they advise care should be taken while plugging/unplugging devices to mitigate this problem. The \"complete cycle\" method some people use is for calibrating multicell laptop batteries, but the N900 only has a single cell battery so it's pointless and marginally harmful to do complete discharge cycles as there's nothing to calibrate.[INTERNAL MEMORY]: The N900 has two memory chips. The first is a 32GB eMMC: 768MB of 'virtual memory' (swap), 2GB for settings and software (ext3 /home), the last ~26GB (MyDocs) is for your files only (software not allowed). The second chip is 256MB of NAND memory (RAM) used for bootloader, kernel and rootfs, twice that of the N810. Optionally, several gigabytes are used for the localized offline Ovi Maps, useful in areas without data coverage.[EXPANDABLE MEMORY]: The N900 has a hot-swappable microSDHC slot under the rear panel. It supports microSDHC cards up to 32GB of any class. The included cable can connect the N900 to a computer for easy transfer of files by allowing the N900 to act as a hard drive, though only \"MyDocs\" is accessible.[GPS & MAPS]: The GPS is a real GPS and has the addition of assisted GPS. The cold fix time with data is about 10-40 seconds with accuracy as good as the Nokia N97. Pre-loaded Ovi Maps are available so a data connection is not required. GPS usually works fine offline, if slow, but due to a bug can fail as the map engine may ask for a connection even when the maptiles are loaded. Ovi Maps uses the GPS to show local weather information. Navigation and mapping with Ovi Maps is free but there is no turn-by-turn voice navigation. The low 1.0 version is due to it being the first Maemo release of Ovi maps explaining the lack of features it has compared to the 3.0 version available on Symbian. Some omissions being the inability to save routes, and inability to look up a contact's address.[FM TRANSMITTER]: The integrated FM transmitter puts audio from the device into radio frequency so you can tune a radio to that frequency and play N900 media wirelessly. It works as advertised but must be very close to the receiving radio.[RADIOS]: The signal strength of the N900's 3G radio is weak. It is possible to turn off the cellular radio without disabling Wi-Fi/Bluetooth by going into offline mode and then manually enabling either. The N900 can use another phone as a 3G modem over Bluetooth but setup is complicated. Bluetooth DUN and PAN modes are supported via community software. Advanced WLAN security, like different kinds of EAP (EAP-PEAP, EAP-MSCHAPv2, etc.), different ciphers (RSA, 3DES, SHA, etc.) and \"authority certificates\" (algorithms like X.509, SHA1RSA) are all supported. With Bluetooth DUN, tethering is supported.[AUDIO]: The built-in stereo speakers are loud but lacking in bass. They make an acceptable portable radio. Bluetooth headphones work great. The audio quality of the 3.5mm jack is loud and slightly more \"forward\" sounding than the more \"laid back\" or \"polite\" sound of other smartphones but without the response peaks, valleys or ripples that so often mar the critical 1,000 Hz. region. Audio sounds more \"present\" than with similar devices. The included earphones have a somewhat dirty signal. Higher frequencies hiss, losing details and the brightness and dynamic volume are shallow, lacking weight and depth. The earphone wires feel like they will become loose over time.========================Application Software========================[SCREEN ORIENTATION]: Most software and the main N900 interface only work in landscape mode. The only time it can be switched to portrait mode is when making or receive a phone call. Rotating the phone into portrait mode opens the keypad automatically after a delay. As of PR 1.2, portrait mode is available for the web browser by default. Emails, Contacts, App and File mangers and PDF reader now all support portrait mode but you must press Ctrl+Shift+R every time to enable it. Third party software orientation is at the discretion of the software developer.[WEB BROWSER]: The overall web experience is amazing, perhaps the best available in a device this size. The web browser is MicroB and supports full Adobe Flash, video and applets providing a very fast, full web experience. Tapping zooms and centers where tapped. Making a circular motion zooms gradually. Moving a finger off the left of the screen produces a mouse arrow for websites requiring this operation. The Flash version is 9.4. Flash 10.1 was originally planned for Q1 2010 but the Head of Maemo Operations, Mountain View has stated that it is never coming to the N900, only to future MeeGo devices. Many Flash games play fine but the keyboard can be iffy. Unfortunately some Flash applets still run after closing the browser and drain the battery. The simplest fix is to reboot. MicroB is based on Firefox which uses Gecko, Webkit browsers are also freely available.[COPY AND PASTE]: Copy and pasting text is allowed in all menus and textboxes.[SOCIAL NETWORKING]: The N900 comes with utilities for using Twitter and Facebook. Social presence is a global service, once connected, the contact list is updated realtime, there's no need to launch 'Contacts'. IM support for MSN, ICQ, AIM, Yahoo, IRC and more is also available through Pidgin. Video calls can be made over IP using Google Talk. Email supports Mail for Exchange (including 2003) and IMAP/POP3. Nokia/Ovi Messaging provides PUSH email for up to 10 simultaneous accounts, including webmail and keeps the accounts separate. Skype calls can be made using 3G.[PRODUCTIVITY]: Included is Documents To Go, a suite of apps for opening MS Office documents. There's a free version that only opens Office files and a pay version for creating and editing Office files. Full versions of AbiWord and OpenOffice are freely available as well.[MEDIA PLAYER]: The media player works but can be picky. Included are some 720p trailers showing the N900's speed and amazing screen. Codec support is unclear and experimenting with \"mostly supported\" media can be a stuttering mess. The media player is okay for music but could use some polishing, the lack of an equalizer was a surprising omission for example. There are also free, community media players like VLC available.[PHONE]: As a phone the N900 has some significant shortcomings. By default there are only two modifiable profiles, however new profiles may be created with a free tool called Tweakr. The rotational start of the phone interface takes several moments. There's no way to filter or organize the call log and call duration is not recorded. There's no speed dial functionality and it's not possible to send an SMS or access device settings from the phone screen. The poor proximity sensor opens random screens while in your pocket and there's no per-contact ringtone support. On the positive side, the call quality and signal strength are excellent. MMS is not officially supported but community software fMMS allows its functionality.========================Operating System========================[INTERFACE]: The OS interface is polished and fluid. You can sweep 360 degrees through four desktops filled with your choice of widgets, shortcuts and wallpaper, easily zooming in and out of open applications. The interface is usually quick and responsive but can stutter. When a dialog opens, the application behind it blurs like frosted glass. All context menus are pop-ups dismissed by pressing outside the menu.[MULTITASKING]: Multitasking is phenomenal. You can run every application with no sign of slowing. Taskswitching is thumbnailed showing what each program is. The active program's window shrinks so all open programs are visible at once. Then any window may be closed using the X in the corner in any order.[TECHNICAL]: The default N900 OS is Maemo 5. Maemo was started in 2005 by Nokia being based on Debian. Future Maemo releases will be merged with Intel's Moblin OS creating MeeGo. Nokia originally planned to support the N900 with MeeGo but since has stated that only a Community Supported release will be available for the N900. Maemo supports over-the-air updates and all software is available freely through user defined software repositories. Apt-get also works great. With Maemo there is no app approval process. The platform is open and free, promoting a strong Maemo community and developer network. The current amount of Maemo software is quite limited compared to other platforms, but growing, especially due to the Ovi store offering commercial software. Maemo 5 has some backwards compatibility with Maemo 4.1 software, but it is fairly limited. As of June 2010 there are about 330 Maemo applications available, although judging the total amount of Maemo software is difficult as it does not have a single distribution channel.[ALTERNATIVES]: The N900 does not require signed kernels which means alternative systems may be installed like Mer, Nitdroid, MeeGo and Debian. Images may be booted on a card or flash memory, like multi-booting on a desktop.[SHELL]: Out of box there is a true linux shell with root access. You can install sshfs and mount shares from a server or even insert a kernel module. Characters missing from the keyboard are accessed with Fn+Ctrl. BusyBox with nano and vi are bundled by default.[DEVELOPMENT]: Maemo offers a POSIX environment allowing use as a UNIX system with native software. Useful for *NIX developers since it opens a lot of possibilities. There are a number of different languages available, and more to come. GUI development is done using standard Linux toolkits GTK and Qt. Python is also available. The N900's implementation of Python is not dumbed down, GUIs can be created with popular toolkits like PyGTK and PyQt. Important since there are many developers that already know how to write N900 applications, even if they don't realize it yet.========================Drawbacks & Issues========================No official MMS support. Doesn't work on AT&T;'s 3G network. No magnetometer (digital compass). No 802.11n. No handwriting recognition. No USB-OTG. No voice dialing. No global kinetic scrolling. Lack of multi-touch. Lack of portrait mode software. Scrolling can be jerky. Kickstand is wobbly with only one position. Mail for Exchange doesn't support Google's Active Sync. Lack of software, especially commercial due to the new OS. Various minor GUI issues that need refining. Various other issues not directly related to the device like spotty Ovi/Nokia support, Nokia launch issues and quality control issues.========================Conclusion========================People are saying the N900 is not a Nokia Internet Tablet anymore and it's just a smartphone but when you use it, you really feel like you're using a device that is more than a smartphone. If you understand the limitations, as mentioned above, can deal with the growing pains as software matures, and value the advantages the N900 offers, you'll be really happy with the N900.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome piece of technology!", "Author": "TrekGeek", "ReviewID": "RJEY567QDFKFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my n900 just a few days ago from Nokia USA. For the purposes of this review, I will compare it to my previous phone, the HTC G1. My opinions are solely based on the user experiences in the past days with the n900, and since I've never owned an iphone, I will not compare it to such.Physical layout:*The N900 is a pretty beefy phone, and rightfully so. While having some heft to it, the n900 is solid and well-built. The black metal rim is a nice touch without being too gaudy. The slide is not spring-assisted but gives a nice click upon opening and closing. I have not noticed any creaks or wobbles from the screen. Few have complained about the back being hard to open. Although true, I rather have that with the peace of mind that the battery won't pop out if I dropped it (God forbid)! the n900 is of comparable size to the G1, albeit being slightly thicker, and not a problem for me.*I don't really understand all the fuss about resistive and capacitive screens. The n900's screen is gorgeous and is incredibly brilliant. There is a little 'give' to the screen, but I've yet to have problems with it. The screen is quite responsive and supports kinetic scrolling. I did have some difficulty clicking on small links in the browser, but that's because your index finger isn't exactly the most accurate pointing device. This was easily solved by zooming in (more on that later).*The keyboard is pretty good. It is a different experience coming from the G1 (as you have to type with the 'chin' in the way on your right hand) so naturally, it felt better. The keys have a grippy rubberized texture feel to them, and although the buttons are smooshed next to each other, (like a real keyboard) they have good response. I do miss the 5-row keyboard on the G1, and I don't understand why the n900's screen doesn't open up a bit more. For those with large hands, it might be a little uncomfortable. However, one plus for the n900 is that my thumbs don't have to travel as far to type.*I love that the placement of the speakers are on the sides of the phone, as opposed to the back on the G1. I do a lot of talking on speakerphone, and so I'm not forced to flip it upside down during a call. Sound quality is good and the speakers are decent.Maemo 5/ Software*This is the ultimate customization OS. When they meant open source, they really meant it. The 4 desktops make things a lot easier to navigate. For example, one page is devoted to my common phone contacts, another utility apps, the third has bookmarks to frequent sites (the homepages of those links are previewed on the desktop, fyi), and so forth.*The way Maemo multitasks is ingenious. The \"overview\" page where you see all your actively running programs makes navigating between windows and programs very easy and efficient. One thing to note is that you have the ability to close out any of those windows upon your choosing, as opposed to the G1 where the 6 app limit neither allowed to you open more nor shut them down, making it very sluggish, especially during critical times (ie texting someone directions while running gps).*SMS (called conversations in Maemo) is pretty similar to the G1, but has one added step - conversations either in text or IM by the same person are displayed in the same window. The ability to have the other person's contact image in the text box (that is if you set one up for that person) is a nice touch. I personally don't care about MMS, so no gripes there.*The email client is pretty decent, I set up my gmail account with a few simple steps, but it isn't nearly as accessible as the gmail app on the G1. For example, I haven't found a way to delete an incoming email when it first comes in. I have to leave the letter, go into the inbox, back into the email, then delete it.*Browsing experience is comparable to the pc, and is nothing short of awesome. Full flash means I can access full youtube pages, and among others. I think the \"swirling zoom\" gesture is pretty neat, and helps me to click on the smaller links. I figured out that using your index to swirl zoom produces the best results. Alternatively, you can double click the screen or use the volume rocker. Going to previous pages not only allows you to go to the last page, but scroll through the entire history of that window. Neat.*Applications-wise, there are not many out there, but I'm certain many will be out soon. You can also access the Maemo repositories for more (google it) but be careful as many of them are still in development and are potentially dangerous to your phone. Noteworthy apps include Hermes (connects your social sites, like facebook to your contacts so you get contact phones, birthdates, etc) and Qik (live streaming recording).Hardware:*Fast, fast, fast. Need I say more?*No hang ups yet, since I can close apps at my own will.*The camera is good, that is for a 5mp phone camera. It will never compare to a dedicated camera, but is more than effective for quick shots to upload on facebook.*The FM transmitter is a great add-on. Now I can share songs without having to look for an aux cable.*Battery life seems to last a little over a day with some text and internet. Wifi is on all the time when I'm at home. My G1 would be down to around 70% by noon.Of course, no phone/mobile device is perfect. Here are some things that came to my attention:*The volume rocker is on the right side (in portrait), meaning it is nearly impossible to use as a zoom when the screen is up. Same goes for the lock switch, which is on the bottom (in landscape). Would have been much better on the sides, as it would be easier to lock after a phone call, for example.*Copy and paste is kinda sporadic. While you can copy all you want on webpages, I couldn't copy a phone number from one contact to another in the phonebook.*The stand is nice, but it swings out way too deep and feels a bit too weak. I'm afraid I'll break it someday.*Little portrait support as of now, but I think it'll be fixed soon.So there you have it. My impressions of the n900. There is still a lot of exploration to be done, but I can honestly say this is the best phone/mobile device I've ever owned. In spite of a few shortcomings, its an amazing piece of technology. A lot of things I didn't mention probably will be fixed within a firmware or two so that isn't a problem. I hope this helps anyone who is on a fence on buying one, good luck!", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Incredible potential. Substandard execution.", "Author": "Kevin Nicholls \"jaded, aging hipster\"", "ReviewID": "R1T7KKC62GZ5JZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I pre-ordered my N900 the moment I found out about it, back in September. And I patiently waited, and waited, while watching every demo, preview, and review I could find. With each passing day, I knew I was closer to mobile bliss. And one day, my N900 arrived.Sadly, it didn't really deliver.Having (briefly) owned an N97, I was incredibly disappointed to discover that Nokia has tried their hardest to port elements of Symbian phones to the Maemo platform. Once you're past the (admittedly awesome) desktop effects, the N900 feels disturbingly similar to the N97 in terms of use.\"Mail Not Responding. Quit?\"If you use e-mail, you're going to see this message. Using the included Mail application for Exchange and an IMAP account is painful, to say the least. If you're coming from another Symbian phone, you'll discover that the Mail application is every bit as slow and constrained as your old phone, but does a (marginally) better job of rendering HTML messages. If you're coming from something like an iPhone or BlackBerry, forget about it. Having an iPhone 3G and BlackBerry Bold as well, the messaging on the N900 is infuriating.The screen is gorgeous, in terms of resolution. It's trash in terms of accuracy, if you aren't using the included stylus. I don't have huge fingers, and yet, nearly every tap is either interpreted wrong, or not registered at all. Using kinetic scrolling will inevitably open something you didn't intend to open, or do nothing at all. You'll find yourself asking \"Did I tap once or twice?\".Web browsing? Brilliant. Seriously. The included web browser is every bit as good as everyone says. Pages render properly, Flash works, zooming in and out is excellent. If you just wanted a handheld web browser and nothing else, I'd recommend this ten times out of ten.\"But it runs Linux! Linux, Linux, Linux!\"Sure. I consider myself to be fairly platform agnostic when it comes to phones, and frankly, the \"open\" nature of Maemo is something of a red herring. Yes, getting applications on the N900 that aren't blessed by Nokia is relatively easy. Yes, you can compile OpenOffice to work on the N900. The question really is: \"Will you?\". In a lot of ways, I can see how the N900 would be an excellent tool if I was a Unix / Linux admin who wanted the flexibility to work anywhere without a laptop or netbook. And, there's a certain geek credibility that comes with doing something for the sake of doing it, especially when you have such a portable platform. The N900 is great for those things. And keep in mind, that's largely the audience that Nokia is targeting with the N900.For well over a decade, Nokia's been known for rock-solid performance on signal and voice quality. With the N900, again, they've come short. 3G call quality is decent. If you're outside of a 3G area (which is likely, if you use this with T-Mobile, and a certainty if you're on AT&T;), the N900 has a very difficult time maintaining a decent GPRS/EDGE signal, and dropped calls are frequent. Admittedly, the phone functionality is something of an afterthought from Nokia on this specific model -- but it really shows.As for carrying it around, the N900 isn't quite the \"brick\" some have claimed it to be. It's definitely substantial, compared to other phones available, though not unreasonable to carry in a pocket. The multimedia functionality is above average, capable of playing just about every type of music and movie format I could throw at it. The camera, while decent, is not substantially better than what you'd find in most midrange to high-end phones in terms of picture quality.Overall, the N900 is a huge series of tradeoffs. For many \"it doesn't do...\" there are workarounds, or will be workarounds, or might be workarounds. And that's really the crux of my rating. The hardware, in and of itself, is not very special for a phone that costs this much. And the shortcomings may well be addressed, but you have to question how much time and effort you're willing to put in to this device just to bring it at par with similarly priced alternatives. At the same time, there's a lot of wishful thinking, if you aren't prepared to roll up your sleeves and do some development work. \"Maybe Nokia will address this in a firmware update...\" or \"Maybe someone will write a script or program that does this...\" will be your mantras if you don't do the work yourself.***January 2010 Update***I'm now on my third N900 -- the previous two were defective.I had considered completely re-writing this review, but too many aspects continue to hold true.What's different:The newer N900 is much more stable, and doesn't crash nearly as often as I had described previously. That's not to say that it doesn't crash, but with the newer hardware and firmware, it no longer crashes if you look at it the wrong way.The developer community is reasonably active on the Maemo platform, and it didn't take very long for some great apps to come out. Installing them doesn't hold a candle to what you'd find on an Android phone or iPhone, but if you're familiar with CVS/SVN or can follow simple instructions, getting some repositories going is a snap, as is finding interesting software. I've been particularly happy with seeing open source projects like Pidgin and Keepass ported over so fast.What's the same:Mail is still pretty terrible, especially if you have a large inbox. Getting the number of messages down will help to make the application more responsive, however, it still is a far cry from what you'd see in competing smartphones on every major platform. It also inexplicably stops updating (yes, fanboys, even when it's not set for off-peak hours), and the \"Last Updated\" timestamp rarely correlates to reality.The OS still needs refinement. Case in point: It simply doesn't do a good job of telling you that it's busy. Sure, nobody wants to build an hourglass (or spinning beachball) in to their OS, but there are times when the OS is just bogged down when you're positive the screen isn't registering taps.All things being equal, I'm still going to hold to my original conclusion that the N900 isn't for the general consumer looking to out iPhone the iPhone. But for someone not afraid of rolling up their sleeves, the N900 can be an amazing device for Unix aficionados and hard-core gadget geeks.Oh... and a quick tip: This car charger works perfectly with the N900, and is dirt cheap: Motorola P513 Vehicle Power Adapter MicroUSB Rapid Rate Charger", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good phone w/ trade-off. Taken off the assembly line too soon", "Author": "E. Brown \"EB\"", "ReviewID": "R309OF87VVO5UR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned 4 Nokia smartphones & a couple of others. Right off the bat, it's a great phone that's fun to use, but I would suggest waiting a while before purchasing this phone. Very few apps available for it, the touchscreen is moody, it comes w/only 1 ringtone. In short, it was taken off the assembly line too soon, but it's remotely upgradable & has great potential.There's an exhaustive list of features. Itemizing them would take a while. Just know that it's packed & does more than most. The stand-outs: Mozilla web browser, 4 active desktops, touch screen & hardware QWERTY & stylus & handwriting recognition, FM transmitter, 32gb, build quality. Unfortunately, there aren't as many apps for Maemo as there are for Symbian or Apple. With only one major phone using Maemo, I'm not sure how many are coming.The N900 is a *very* solid phone. For a unit w/a sliding mechanism, it's built like a bank vault - no squeaks or rattles. Understated matte black, tightly fitted, bright screen. It's incredibly fun to use and the large screen is a winner.If you've never used a smartphone before, you'll probably be dazzled by the multi-tasking & configurability. If you've never had a high-end phone, you'll fall in love w/ the camera, video, web & the host of features. There's lots to love (Compare this to any other phone at gsmarena.) As a seasoned smartphone user, I'll itemize my cons below.To be fair, the N-Series models are made to have their own specialties. The N82 is the camera, hence the Xenon and editing. The N900 is all about the web and that it does exceptionally well. However, the browser does crash more often than any other smartphone I've used. Then again, it loads every page just as it would on a desktop, so the browser is doing more. (Again, not quite ready for production). The web and social networking is top of the line. Unlike Symbian phones, the N900 is very simple to configure.CALENDAR/ALARM: Unlike previous N-Series units, calendar alarms do not ring if the phone is off.PHOTO/VIDEO: The N900 has no photo editor, only a crop & flip program. It's a shame for a camera that shoots such quality videos. 5mp & Zeiss lens... but no editor? The N900 offers no video editor either. This is par for the course for iPhones and Blackberrys, but N-Series have always had video editing features. You can no longer cut/merge video and overlay text.KEYBOARD: The N900's wide keyboard makes it difficult to type quickly. As there are no spaces between the keys, serious attention must be paid when entering text. Entering numbers/symbols sometimes requires holding one key whilst typing the number. I'm actually able to enter text much faster on the N82, than with the N900s sprawling layout & jammed keys. In spite of numerous text entry mechanisms, entering text on the N900 is awkward. The virtual keyboard is actually better than the hardware keyboard, but requires greater attention. I wouldn't have guessed that a teachable T9 would be quicker than both QWERTYs.TOUCH SCREEN: Touch screens take getting used to & aren't as exacting as a cursor, but they're blingy. The slightest bit of uneven pressure, jerking or inconsistency in your swipe and you're opening an application. 90% of the time, you'll be using the stylus as even the smallest fingers will misfire. You have this large, heavy phone, making long strokes on the screen, sliding out a QWERTY or juggling strokes w/ a stylus. Yet, it feels more computer like & it's fun to use. The large screen is worth the bulk... the QWERTY, not so much.2nd CAMERA: The secondary camera does not work. Usually, these second lenses are used for video calls in parts of Europe. In The States, they can only be used for self photos or quick MMS vids of yourself. With the N900, it's simply window dressing. VERY disappointing, but I'm sure an update is on the way. Again, taken off the assembly line too soon.SAVING IMAGES & BLUETOOTH: When transferring photos to the phone via Bluetooth, there is no setting to allow automatic acceptance as there is w/ other N-Series. Additionally, images transferred to the N900 via Bluetooth, are saved in the document folder, sometimes the videos folder, rarely the images folder. Videos may appear in a camera folder. ...Who knows?OPERATION: You cannot back out of many applications. If you close a program in a file or program from the menu, you must start all over finding that spot. Annoying.The phone comes loaded with only one ringer, Nokia's, unless you add others. I just expect a phone of this price and caliber to have a working front camera and ringtones already, call me crazy.The camera flash is good, but this flagship's flash isn't on par w/ the older, cheaper N82's Xenon. Again, every phone has it's purpose. E-Series are for business, N-Series for multimedia - some camera, others Internet. Fair enough... but at this price?If a message comes in while using the device, a small bubble pops up w/ the person's name & first few words of message... then disappears. Nice touch.OVERALL: The N900 is features-packed, solid and quite fun to use. It's focus is being an Internet tablet... but one that comes w/ a high end camera. To this end, it surely delivers. For the price, however, I expected the N900 to include photo/video editing software, working front camera & document *editor*. If you want a features-packed, high end phone w/a better hardware QWERTY & a touch screen, check out HTC's. However, Nokia's smartphones are the only ones (to my knowledge) that don't require monthly PDA fees of $25 to access the net (like BlackBerry, Palm, Apple do). So, the N900 paired with T-Mobile's flat fee for Internet usage means you can have unlimited Internet for only $7 extra per month. Everything is a trade-off.iPHONE: The iPhone 3Gs isn't really in the same league as this phone. First off, the iPhone is *not* a smartphone because you cannot multi-task. N-Series allow my music to play whilst I browse/edit photos, calendar, etc. This is what the N900 offers that the iPhone 3Gs does not: 5 megapixels to iPhone's 3, dual flash to iPhones no flash, FM radio, FM transmitter (so you can play you music in your car wirelessly even if it doesn't have Bluetooth), takes a 16gb memory card, plays DivX videos, PDF viewer, Flash 9.4, hardware QWERTY, stylus... Get the picture?If the web is the most important thing to you... you really want a large screen... you prefer QWERTYs... want a great camera/video recorder... you leave a lot of applications open & need lots of memory... and you don't wish to be saddled w/ $25 Apple/BlackBery/HTC/Palm fees - the N900 is for you... but I'd wait a few months for more apps and upgrades.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Jailbreaking not needed.", "Author": "F. S. Mohd.", "ReviewID": "R1K128MUDTWOTS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everybody I work with has an iPhone.  The N900 is pretty good.  What I don't like about it is that some pretty basic things you would expect for a phone these days to do, it doesn't do right off the bat.  However, these functions are already being added to developers websites so they may not even be a problem by the time you're reading this review.  At the moment what is kinda annoying about the phone:* I will be purchasing another N900 as my original was stolen in Frankfurt.* No personalized alarm tone for different alarms - all alarms must use the same tone.* Snooze time on clock setting are only 5min, 10min, and 15min.  I want a 7min snooze time.That's all I can think of.----The only reason I have this phone instead of an iphone is because of what the iphone couldn't do.  I wasn't going to change my habits to suit the phone.  There are plenty phones out there that have adapted to do what the user wants.What I like about it.* I don't need itunes to do anything!  you just connect via USB to your computer and transfer a folder of Mp3, M4a, WMA, etc... whatever you have onto the phone and you're done.  It's sad when you're a slave to itunes.  I didn't need itunes to rip, burn, or download mp3s before and I'm not gonna start now, or ever.* Video playback!  I don't have to re-encode any of my video files.  It plays just about every format out there.  And I don't have to resize the videos to a lower resolution.  So I just got done watching Dexter season 3 on the phone without having to do anything more than copy it from my computer.  - Update. (11-Mar-2010) A codec pack was released at the end of Jan that gives additional video support for - AC-3 audio, Vorbis OGG, FLAC, Musepack, Flash video, RealMedia formats, Matroska container support, and MPEG2 Transport Streams.  So that is A LOT of coverage.* I don't have to jailbreak it to do all the things it can do.  If there's a new app or widget or whatever, i can just download it and install.* As of this post, there's already an NES, GBA, and Game Boy color emulator for the N900.  UPDATE - It also has a SNES and Sega emulator.* I can use bluetooth straight out of the box to my wireless headset (Motorola S9HD).  I could not do this with iphone.* USB mass storage mode straight out of the box.  Because of this, I can stream movies from my phone to any TV in the house over the network without having to copy files onto my computer.* expandable microSD slot.  So I currently have 48gb (32gb on board +16gb card) of storage.  It will be even more when a bigger microSD card is released.* It has a video out (PAL and NTSC) cable so I don't even need a computer to connect my phone to a TV.* FM Transmitter!  - Update. (11-Mar-2010) FM transmitter works pretty good in vehicles.  It even sends the artist name and song info to the display of the car radio if your radio is that type.  But it really depends on how good the radio is on your receiving device as it didn't work so great with my boom box unless I placed it directly on top of my boom box.  However in my vehicle, it worked fine while it was in hip holster while I was driving.-* It syncs up easily with Outlook.  Even auto added birthdays to the calendar. - it even synced the profile pictures I chose on my phone back to Outlook for each contact.* I like the interface.  After about 20 minutes with the device, I was moving around really fast and easy.

I love this phone. Now a day I'm not easily excited or impressed by a phone. Couple of years back, you had a game changing new model every four to six months. But now, I bought the Xperia X1 last Dec and I don't find any drastic improvements in the last year or so.And to start with N900 wasn't even on my radar a couple of months back. I was too busy drooling over the HD2 and X10. Since both are about 6 months away (at least states side). I turned my attention to N900 and I'm so impressed. I feel how I did 4-5 years back having a smartphone which could browse web and check mails.One word of advice though, actually a couple. Don't approach this phone as a phone. Think of it as an internet tablet with phone capability. Next, don't think it would replace your iPhone or an Android mobile feature for feature.Put it this way,1. You are never going to get 10,000 or so apps on this.2. You don't get the eye candy or the capacitive touch screen3. Nothing is laid out to you. No entering your gmail id and see the phone set it itself4. It's no iPod. Not a multimedia device per sayBut,1. The resistive touch screen is not bad. In fact its one of the best I have used. Take my word for it, this wont be a deal breaker. Just don't expect iPhoneish response2. I love the display. One of the few with 16M colors and it shows. It has a 480x800 display and it has 4 'desktops'. Love making the 480x3200 wallpaper.3. Love the Skype and IM integration. First time the phone rang, it took me 5 mins to realize it's through Skype.4. The browser and the legendary flash support. It's good, it's amazing. But be aware its not v10, its still v95. The keyboard is good and feels good too. But need time to get used to the right aligned space bar6. Its not iPhone. Thank God for it.7. Phone looks solid and built quality is top notch.8. Has 32GB and a micro sd slot.Few other things to know, <Edit 01/21/2010>1. Cam is not all that impressive2. BT is almost unusable. The phone shuts off the speakers (this incl calls and alarm) while connected to the headset. You have to wear the head set all the time or expect to miss calls and meetings.~~ This has been fixed in the recent software update  2a. The phone frequently disconnects the headset after a call and need to restart the headset to connect again.~~ This is also fixed.3. Setting up the exchange server is pain in all the wrong places  3a. Google exchange is not supported  3b. Works fine with Nuevasync but wont sync mail more than 2 weeks. Get an server not responding message if you set to anything more than 2 weeks.~~ Now it supports MFX 2003 too. I haven't tried google but there is not off word yet that its supported. But Nuevasync works fine4. Full fledge Skype app is still not ready5. Ovi store for N900 is not ready ~~ Ovi store is now open6. N900 is not added to the Ovi services (like contacts, calendar and others)~~ Still not supported.7. Not very impressed by the Ovi map~~ The Ovi map got a little improvement but the newly announced free Turn by turn nav support is not coming to N900 as of now.8. Nokia messaging is nice but I would prefer a native idle IMAP support (to get push mail from IMAP servers)~~ The idle IMAP support is still missingg  8a. Nokia messaging is very slow. When you open it only the local folder show up. Even the already downloaded mail don't show up instantly. It take a about 5 secs to get everything going.~~They have fixed this. Now its pretty bearable. take about 1-2 sec for a new msg to open.9. Do not use the facebook widget, it drains the battery like there is no tomorrow. Actually like there in no today evening10. Though the app list would grow; its still has only about 50 or so apps.11. No native google voice support11. Phone can't be used in portrait mode. Except for the dialer. For me this is no issue. In fact I love it can work only in landscape.Conclusion:This phone has great potential, but a lot of quirks. These are both software and hardware. Example, why no capacitive screen? why no bigger battery, why no IDLE support? Why can't it sync mails through google's exchange server? why is the Nokia messaging so slow? why can't I sync more than 2 weeks of mails from nuevasync?These might be answered in a software update and the next models (they have already announced that 2010 will see an upgrade) will be much more refined.I have a feeling this phone is not for the masses but if you are a gadget junky and need a new fix now and again, you can't do nothing wrong with this phone. Get it with eyes closed.Folks looking for an iPhone replacement, please keep searching.

I've been using the N900 for almost 30 days.It is my opinion that most of the negative points in the reviews seem a little extra specialized in nature.  i.e. They aren't really show stoppers for the typical user.  Although some issues are real, I found others to be petty, not quite accurate or already fixed through software updates.  Reading the online (101 page) manual helps too.There is only one real issue with the N900 for me:* Portrait view is supported only in phone function.  A portrait option for all functions would clearly make the N900 easier to handle and use.Things I didn't like at first but now consider non-issues.There isn't a To-Do List but I've learned to use the Task function on Calendar and now, it actually works better than the To-Do List I was using on my previous Nokia.Sound  is not adjustable (no equalizer) when using audio through Media player.  After a couple of weeks, this has become a non-issue.  Essentially, the sound from this unit's two speakers is above average.Regarding the touch screen:  At first I was using the stylus but gradually migrated over to the touch screen in combination with the physical and online keyboard.  It's a breeze once you get on to it.The phone did seem a little heavy at first but this too became a non-issue.  Considering we're only talking about an ounce or two, I (somehow) managed to adapt.  I added a wrist strap which has been helpful.Issues raised in other reviews:I have experienced no technical issues; No freezing or lock ups as described in some reviews.  The phone performed perfectly out of the box. I've used Bluetooth and have had no issues.Regarding battery life:  I charge this phone mostly every night and sometimes hook up the car charger during the day.  I've been doing this for years with all my phones.  You never know when you're going to use up a large chunk of battery, no matter what phone you have.Call quality and reception is outstanding.  Web browsing is smooth and very fast.The four desktops provide ample room for shortcuts to frequently used applications.  Once your shortcuts are set up, you can pretty much go anywhere you want with just one or two touches of the screen.With a 16GB memory card, I was able to sync mp3 files through Windows Media and contacts through Outlook Express without a hitch.  Just a couple of clicks for each process and the phone took over.In all honestly, the more I use this phone, the more I like it.

Yes, my name makes it blatantly obvious that I'm Finnish, but that has absolutely nothing to do with me liking the Nokia N900. I have lived in North America all my life, and really couldn't care less whether Nokia is in Finland or Frisia. In fact, until recently, my handheld loyalty was not to Nokia, but to Palm; it was only after Palm betrayed their roots by abandoning PalmOS and going to this ridiculous \"webOS\" absurdity that I knew it was time to make a switch. Had Palm stayed true to what they did best, the latest generation of PalmOS devices would still be the only handheld devices in the world worth getting or using, but this can no longer because the case, because there's no such thing as a latest generation of PalmOS devices. The Nokia N900 is a great device, not because of any ethnocentrism on my part, but simply because of its technical merits.What are those technical merits, you may ask? First and foremost, the Maemo 5 operating system, code-named \"Fremantle.\" As Nokia's own flavour of Debian Linux, Maemo has been around for a while, of course; we've seen it in Nokia's previous \"Internet tablet\" devices like the 770, N800, and N810, but those devices had only Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, not true cellphone connectivity. If you've used one of those devices, you already know how great they are, so consider the N900 basically a similar device with GSM connectivity to boot, meaning you can take the already-mature Maemo interface almost anywhere in the world and get online with it.Before we go into details, let's go ahead and get a couple of things out of the way which aren't important, but which have been mentioned by some others: Contacts and calendaring. As basic logic and reason can tell you, if you need an entry stored in your phone to remind you of who someone is, that person obviously isn't very important to you anyway. I challenge anyone to make sense of the practice of keeping thousands of people's names in a contact list because those people are \"so critical\" to the listkeeper that it's necessary to look those people up to remember who they are. As for a calendar, the N900 is for those people who understand that life is for living, not scheduling. If you care about either of these things, what you want is not a smartphone, but a pocket planner. Go to any office-supply store and buy one for a few dollars.That said, let's get started on the important things. For starters, the N900 is the only major mobile device currently on the market that gives you a real command prompt out of the box, with no tricks or hacks required. You get the phone, you turn it on, and \"X Terminal\" is already in the applications list. Sure, there are ways to get similar functionality on other phones, but none of them give you this option without resorting to bizarre tricks that appear to have the manufacturer's disapproval; yeah, you can jailbreak the iPhone to get a real BSD prompt, but jailbreaking the iPhone is a whole other can of worms that Apple has done as much as they can to prevent. You can install an application from the Android Market to give you a command prompt on an Android device, but PTerminal, which used to be the standard app for this, was removed from the Market; do you really want to base your device's functionality on some online store which the manufacturer can change or revoke at their will? Despite the Droid's claims of what it \"Does,\" it's clear that one thing Google doesn't want you to do is actually get root on the phone. As for the Palm Pre, yeah, I know there's that trick where you can root the Palm Pre with the Konami code, but does anyone really care? Some people derive entertainment from imagining that they're clever by using such tricks, but at the end of the day, your needs are generally better served by a device that actually tries to allow you to do what you want to do instead of forcing you to break it in unexpected ways just so you can do basic things like get a command line. The N900 is a recourse for those who want genuine freedom from their smartphones, and who don't mind the phone giving that freedom willingly instead of requiring you to break into it.Naturally, then, when you receive an N900, the first thing you should do is use the Desktop menu's \"Add shortcut\" command to add a shortcut to X Terminal to the desktop, since it is the most important application on the N900. In fact, you'll probably make your first use of the command line very early on: Like many phones, the N900's GUI does a poor job of communicating the device's battery level, only showing a tiny icon which gives a rough graphical indication of the battery level. Thankfully, the phone has a simple shell command which shows the battery level as a numerical percentage. You can package this command into a shell script, which is how things should be done anyway. The shell command to view the battery level is: lshal|grep percenNow, the N900's list of installed applications isn't complete. For example, it comes with vi, but not EMACS. This will work out well for some people, but personally, I vastly prefer EMACS; thankfully, QEmacs, a relatively light but functional version of EMACS, is available for download. For those who want them, pico and nano are also not available out of the box, although of course they can be installed as well. In fact, it must be borne in mind that since this phone runs a variant of Debian, you have a virtually limitless library of free software at your fingertips that you can download for free, since dpkg and apt-get both come with the device. Yes, \"apt-get install dosbox\" works just fine from the command prompt, although before you start installing .deb packages from the command line, you may want to check the N900's built-in \"Application manager,\" since many common Linux programs have already been made into packages especially for Fremantle. However, the catch is that the application manager's main repository of interesting programs is hidden by default. By far the largest catalogue of programs is simply called \"Extras,\" and it is disabled by default. Once Extras' \"Disabled\" check box is unchecked, many more applications become available. The first one of these you should install is rootsh, as it will give you the ability to become root in X Terminal using the \"sudo gainroot\" command. Out of the box, the N900 has no simple way for you to become root. Admittedly, this is a bit of a work-around, but it has Nokia's full approval, and this additional extra step is more of a way to protect newbies from accidentally doing something catastrophic as root than an intent to prevent users from becoming root in the first place.Once you've gotten settled into the N900 by becoming root, you'll want to get down to actual usage, and since the primary reason to get a smartphone is so you can have a handheld PC in your pocket, I'll confirm that there is a version of DOSBox 0.73 for Fremantle, and yes, it installs and runs quite nicely on the N900. Performance is a little choppy (especially the sound, which tends to glitch every couple of seconds), so you probably won't be running Quake on this device comfortably, but most DOS programs set up and run without major issues. Mouse emulation works a little strangely, with taps on the screen not seeming to consistently register mouse-clicks in the same place you tapped, but keyboard emulation is surprisingly comfortable, although the N900's lack of a full PC keyboard means that you may have to make some compromises in terms of key emulation if you're planning to play a flight simulator which has hundreds of active gameplay keys.Going beyond everyday usage and looking at the overall craftsmanship of the N900, the device feels sturdy and solid; it is slightly thicker than a typical smartphone on the market today (probably partly because of the inclusion of built-in stereo speakers), but not significantly heavier. The N900 does have a handful of nagging quality-control issues; among the most worrisome of these is the rebooting issue that seems to afflict about 10% of the N900s and causes them to reboot constantly (approximately every few minutes), rendering the device almost unusable. If you have a root shell (which can be gained using the rootsh application and the \"sudo gainroot\" command, as above) then you can do what usually fixes this issue, which is to edit the /etc/pmconfig file (which you can do using vi) and change the line which says \"enable_off_mode 1\" to say \"enable_off_mode 0\" (in other words, simply change the 1 to a 0). After you save the file, power down the phone and turn it back on using the power button at the top. My particular phone had this issue, and this simple change appears to have fixed it; the phone still randomly reboots, but now it happens about once a month, instead of once every 5 minutes as it did when I first got the device.(Oh, and while on the topic of tweaking config files: If you want to turn off that slightly annoying video of the two hands grasping each other which shows up each time you turn on the N900, edit the /etc/hildon-welcome.d/default.conf file and just place a # sign in front of the \"filename\" line to comment it out, so that the line ultimately looks like this:)#filename=Hands-v32-h264.aviSpeaking of first getting the device, one thing that those who've been afflicted with more popular phones will immediately appreciate is the usability of being able to turn the phone on and start using it right away without having to \"activate\" it. I almost didn't believe the stories I'd heard about having to activate other phones until I took a look at the other phones and tried them for myself. The stories really are true: The iPhone, the Palm Pre, and even the Motorola Droid all require you to \"activate\" the phone before you can start using them. I really can't imagine what kind of person tolerates this insanity without taking the phone straight back to the store; this is particularly egregious given the \"Droid Does\" marketing slogan, promoting all the amazing things the Droid can do. One thing that Droid Doesn't: Work without requiring you to activate the phone with Verizon. In a similar vein, anyone who's had an iPhone has probably seen the \"Activation required\" screen, which is basically a picture of a cable and the iTunes logo, with an arrow pointing from the former to the latter, and a \"slide for emergency\" slider at the bottom. You literally need to have iTunes installed on a regular computer and plug the iPhone into the computer to get past this screen. Even if we momentarily disregard the fact that the whole point of owning a smartphone is to replace a computer, and thus the idea of needing to plug your phone into a computer is sort of like the concept of forcing your spouse to make out with your other spouse, the idea that the phone will literally lock itself up until plugged into some controlling piece of software is so absurd that it genuinely appals me that people will so gladly carry around these ticking time bombs in their pockets and then talk about how cool their phones are. The \"slide for emergency\" screen might be acceptable to people who don't understand computers and want their computer to be a beautifully-stylized box that costs too much and does nothing but flash pretty lights in their face--in other words, people who are already hopelessly brainwashed Apple users--but anyone with half a brain will recognize that getting a phone that requires this kind of phoning-home \"activation\" process is ideological suicide. If you want a useless piece of plastic that will regularly stop working until you plug it into a computer running iTunes because it's just so cool and you want to brag to all your friends about how you wasted money on a \"hip\" product, the iPhone is for you. If you want a phone that just works--in other words, if you want a smartphone that is actually smart--the decision is obvious. I was briefly considering getting a Droid because of the hype, but today, I'm so very relieved that I got the N900, because as another company's marketing line says, \"It just works\" for me when I need it to and doesn't require me to register with some draconian wireless carrier, because the N900 is relatively carrier-agnostic and designed to be a stand-alone device that you can choose to use without any wireless contract at all.I say \"relatively\" carrier-agnostic because the N900 uses the European standard 3G frequencies of 1700MHz and 2100MHz, which are also supported in the United States by T-Mobile USA, but not by AT&T;'s 3G network (which uses the 850MHz and 1900MHz frequency bands). The phone will still work with AT&T;'s network, but only using 2G protocols, not 3G. The only way to get 3G connectivity with the N900 in the United States with a major carrier is to sign up with T-Mobile USA. This may be something of a setback for people who had their hearts set on getting 3G with AT&T;, but realistically, do you honestly want to give your scarce money to a controlling fascist organization like AT&T; anyway?One thing I'm very, very grateful for in the N900 is that it uses a resistive touchscreen instead of the capacitive touchscreens which are so popular right now. This is a pretty bold move by Nokia, since it essentially bucks the current trend, but it allows you to use the phone's included stylus, and there's simply no way around the fact that a stylus lets you choose items from the screen with much greater precision that sticking your fingers on the screen. Let the Apple fanboys fumble with the iPhone's asinine on-screen keyboard, which seems to only figure out what letter you're trying to type in about half the time; with a resistive touch-screen, the phone will figure out exactly what you're trying to tap on. It's true that resistive touchscreens aren't quite as responsive as capacitive ones, but the ability to use inorganic objects to tap buttons on the screen is more than worth this slightly decreased sensitivity. Of course, anyone who complains that the resistive touchscreen doesn't allow for \"multi-touch\" capability and is looking for something which reacts well to being touched in multiple places at once should look into getting a girlfriend.In terms of the \"nice to have\" extras, the N900 pretty much has it all. Yes, it has a 5-megapixel camera which takes pretty good photos, it has GPS functionality built-in as standard functionality (not an \"extra\" which you need to pay more for), it does tethering (although I haven't tested this personally), it has an accelerometer (which is what enables that \"Bounce\" game which everybody loves to use as a proof-of-concept demo on this device), and it has a multi-color charging indicator/status LED. Depending on what you intend to do with the device, any of these may be a big deal or they may be completely inconsequential, but they're all great to have just in case.Considering all that it does, I simply assumed that short battery life would be something N900 owners would have to live with, but Nokia has pulled off a near-miracle by somehow getting excellent battery life out of this thing. Nokia's stated goal with the N900 was full-workday battery life, meaning you should be able to actively use the device for 8 hours without a recharge. I haven't actually tried this (I use the N900 in relatively short bursts of activity; I rarely find myself having cause to use it for hours at a time), but it seems like I do get many hours of active use between chargings. The battery in the N900 isn't especially large or heavy, so I really have no idea how they did this, but I'm glad they did.So what does the N900 not do well? Admittedly, the N900 isn't perfect. For casual users, its primary downfall may end up being its keyboard; although the keyboard is quite functional and comfortable to type on, it has only three rows, most of which are used up by the letters of the alphabet. An extra row of keys would have considerably enhanced the usability of the keyboard and reduced the constant resorting to bucky-bits that is required when typing almost anything that's not a letter or a common punctuation mark.For those who intend to install a whole lot of applications, however, the N900's single biggest shortcoming is its critical lack of storage space. This is where Nokia really dropped the ball: Nokia's one huge mistake was to assume that users wouldn't want to install a lot of additional applications onto the device, but would rather use it for storing a lot of movies and music and other large media. To this end, the \"/home/user/MyDocs\" folder that comes with the device has more than 20GB of storage space, but the \"rootfs\" file system (where all Debian packages will get installed) is only 256MB, and when you get the N900, most of that is already filled with things that come preinstalled. A factory-new N900 has about 70MB of rootfs space available. While this is enough to install some fun things, you will not be able to use the N900 to store and run the entire Debian repository of software, which would require at least a few gigabytes of storage. This is the one single limiting factor of the N900 that prevents it from being a potential true computer replacement (besides the possible limitation of its keyboard, which lacks enough keys to be a true desktop replacement). Some relief may come from efforts to \"optify\" software for the N900, meaning to rewrite applications in such a way that they install to the device's larger /opt directory (which is intended for user-installed applications), but it's absurd that developers should have to modify existing code which already works fine with mainstream desktop Linux distributions. The N900 should have been designed to handle its own quirks instead of expecting existing code to change for the device. If you can restrain yourself from downloading and installing the entire Debian library of apps, and can live with only running perhaps a few dozen programs at most, the N900 should serve you perfectly well, but anyone who just wanted to firehose the entire operating system into their smartphone will need to wait for Nokia to release a phone with a multi-gigabyte rootfs.There's one other thing which I should probably touch on in this review: You may be wondering, how well does the N900 serve as a voice device? Well, I've had my N900 for about 3 months now, and in that time, I've been waiting to have a car accident or other event which would give me a reason to make a phone call, but things have been pretty quiet, so I'm afraid I can't attest as to how well the N900 actually works as a telephone. Other people have testified that it does have voice chat capability built in, so I think it's reasonable to assume that it's functional in this regard.I've said a few things about what the N900 is capable of, but I've only scratched the surface, because the N900 is a genuine computing device, running a fully-compiled Debian Linux knockoff which allows you to install any .deb package. This means that calling the N900 a \"phone\" is something of an insult; this really is a handheld computer, upon which you can install any application you want. The pre-existence of this kind of mature library of freely-made and -contributed software is the real beauty of a device running a Linux variant like Maemo. As with any computer, the possibilities are as limitless as your imagination. I used to be against capital punishment, but after spending just a few weeks with the N900, it seems that it is a good solution for users who want any of the other, inferior so-called smartphones mentioned in this review.

I am a cellular salesman , I have been since 2007 so I've followed cell phones closely only because I'm crazy about them, and I normally change phones a few times a year. Not anyone more, The Nokia N95 actually kept me for 2 years and I'm sure this Nokia N900 will keep me for 2 years or more. This phone/mobile computer is a good investment, The only rumored phone to be released this year or next based on this platform is the Nokia N920(in progress title) and the N920 does not have a keyboard like the N900, so this will be similar to T-mobile G1 and My touch 3G I imagine. In that respect even if they come out with a newer model with a snap dragon processor , it won't be a huge leap I believe, I can't imagine any programs that can run on snapdragon that won't run on the N900's Cortex A8 even if it needs a little tweaking. Anyway This phone is definitely for geeks and enthusiasts.I think it's pointless to repeat what everyone else is saying, so I'll just tell you to believe them, this phone really is that fantastic, all the hardware you could need for a long time is there and any feature not yet implemented will be soon, MMS is not available on this handset however they have recently released a MMS program in the Developer repository on this phone that allows you send and receive MMS. I mentioned this because any feature that is not available yet can always be added. The Maemo platform allows for real integration into the os with third party apps and not some cheap parlor tricks, or under developed interfaces. there are a lot of downloads for third party plugins that don't even have their own interface, they work so well that they use the standard Maemo OS interface to configure them, such as adding Aim support( AIM chat is not available out of box). However once installed , you can configure them through conversations just like the other protocols that came with the phone such as skype etc.( There are many others this was just the easiest example).Anyway if you reading all of this, it means your seriously considering this phone, if you want to have everything at your finger tips and want to have piece of mind knowing that your phone CAN'T become outdated anytime soon or later for that matter, then this phone is for you.Just be ready for the weight, the phone is about 1.5x heavier than other smartphones.

After all, why would anyone want to drop over $400 on a phone, that's, well, not really a phone, and has had a lot of excellent reviews, but also a few terrible ones, that if true, would make your purchase a complete waste of money? Let me guess, you are a bit of a technophile, not necessarily a dweeb or a Linux hound, and you may or may not have heard of an 'X terminal' ( or whatever it's called ;) ) and you might be put off by all this hacking talk and 'root, supervisor, debian' language etc? So I would like to relay my experience in going though this process and getting on the N900 wagon :) (12 steps anyone?;) just kidding!)I consider myself a techno type person, I love the gadgets, but do not just rush out and blindly purchase the latest and greatest soon to be doorstop! As a scientist by profession, research and more research is my approach. I've been following the N900 since it's release last year, and have seen, what was almost a prototype (!) evolve nicely, so much so that many, if not all of the early software complaints have now been alleviated either by Nokia, or by some very clever, and generous, members of the N900 coding community (Thank you to them).Anyway, about two weeks ago I was reading the newer reviews and came across a recent purchaser's words that really made sense. To paraphrase, they said to treat the (incredibly powerful) N900 as a normal phone, just learn the bits that make sense to you at the time, and explore it's capability as your knowledge of the system increases. No pressure! All of a sudden I didn't have to be a techno wizard, :) all you had to do was play and enjoy your new gadget. It was really the excuse I had been waiting to hear! ;)So, a 'click' at 8am Monday, and overnight shipping (highly recommended, it was only an extra $10), a box arrived by breakfast Tuesday! So, it's only been a few days (and I will update this after more experience), but here are some thoughts.The resistive screen thing: yes it is different to the Apple products (I'm writing this on a iPad), but certainly as functional and easy to use. You have to use a little more pressure it seems, and maybe be a tad more deliberate with your 'swipes', but it works really well. Zooming is also easy. No multitouch here, but with the volume rocker acting as a zoom switch, and intelligent 'double tapping' zooming, it all works very well. I have heard many complaints about the Maemo operating system, but to be honest, I find it intuitive, accurate, clever, easy to use, and with a quick learning curve. Getting to grips with the symbian system on the E90 was much more complicated IMHO.The iphone thing: Many of my friends have iPhones, and these tend to be the nontechnical types who really just want a pretty interface that can play pandora music or look up the weather. If you are thinking about a iPhone, go ahead, it is a fun machine. If you want more however, then the N900 might be for you. Truly a pocket computer (which you need to recharge every night, just like if you used your laptop all day), it's capabilities are only limited by the imagination of those clever programming types who donate their time and skills to exploring the power of this machine.Three things I would like to figure out in this regard (anyone working on this? ;) ) 1) get the video working on a skype call, 2) utilize latitude with google maps (I am sure google will bring this out soon for the N900, please? ), and 3) an easy non techo way to set up voip calls, so that all you need would be a data plan, and thus save the price of the phone within a year !! :)Anyway, other reviews have covered the hardware and software adequately, and I won't repeat them here. Overall, I am very, very happy with the N900, and you never know, one day I might actually find out what that X terminal thing is all about ;)Thanks for reading.R.-----OK, well I have been using the N900 for about a month now and have got the hang of things a little - so here is an update on what you might find.To address some the concerns I have read about:Firstly the Maemo OS continues to amaze me with it's logical layout and easy learning curve. I suppose those who found difficulty with it were quite entrenched in their favorite systems.There are certainly less 'apps' for Maemo than for the iPhone, but many of those iPhone apps are simply front ends for web pages, and as the N900 can access any web page you have the entire internet available to you, (and if you do not need a 'beer drinking' app, you won't miss much ;) )The top row of keys is very close to the screen as it slides up, and if you are in a hurry, catching the correct letter may be a problem. The solution? Slow down ;) Seriously - take that extra two seconds to type your SMS and there will be no problem. Besides, the virtual keyboard is also very good.Battery life - yes - it chews through power like a Ferrari on the home stretch :) and several hours of wifi / bluetooth / phone calls a day will require you to recharge overnight, or maybe in the evening. Some nifty little programs available allow you to turn the wifi on/off with one click, and that helps immensely.No voice dialing, true, but there is a speed dial of sorts. I have filled two of the four 'home screens' with shortcuts to a dozen or more individual contacts, and so two touches of the screen dials a particular number - no problem :)Now onto the things that really make it just feel good to use this thing:I find that I am using the speakerphone a lot as it is so clear, meaning less things in your ear as you wander around the room :)Many times while out & about I have received calls from friends who are calling using skype from their computers. As this phone has voip built in (I have skype and google talk accounts set up), the call integration is seamless and you cannot tell the difference between an incoming skype call and incoming cell call - either way it rings, the caller id pops up, and you answer. This is the way communication will go - and the N900 has it already built in :)The ability to have multiple applications up & running is natural, just like your home computer. Didn't realize it was even an issue until the complaints about the iPhone! I usually keep 4 or five apps running - email, weather, sms, notes, podcasts, etc. It also ends up as the 'bedside radio' with easy to use podcasts and internet stations.Customization: the N900 interface is completely customizable, even more so really than your laptop. I have it so that it mimics the display on the MacBook at home, so icons and programs are in similar places.Evernote - everything you need, in your own personal cloud :) and available on your N900. Star Trek move over !! Amazing.I've just signed up for skype credit with the ultimate goal of reducing dependance on 'minutes' on the cell phone plan and using the data plan instead. For $3/mo you can get unlimited calls within the US, and for 2c/min you can call the UK. You still have the issue of incoming calls taking up your minutes of course. It is easy to use skype as when you open up a contact there are the phone numbers you expect, but also the option to 'call with skype'. Very straightforward.I could go on, but you get the idea - awesome phone, a real powerhouse with as much potential as you wish to use. Hope you enjoy yours as well :)R---------", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect phone/computer/camera/camcorder/GPS !!!", "Author": "Srinivas Katta \"cyberdentist\"", "ReviewID": "R2XI9HZ6516K1Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I currently use an iPhone 2G with T-mobile that I bought unlocked on eBay and as much as I would like a 3G iPhone, it wont work on Tmobile network so my next alternative was to look at this incredible phone/computer Nokia N900. I will keep this review simple and easy.Pros:- Incredible software - Maemo- Multi tasking at its best!- FM Transmitter is just incredible- Bluetooth is not stunted like that of iPhone!- Sync software is one of the best and you can sync the phone via Bluetooth !!!!!!- Very easy to navigate and very intuitive settings- Easy to set up emails.. but (see the continuation of this under 'cons')- Camera is 5MP with Carl Zeiss lens and is probably the best I have seen on any phone yet- Video shoots at DVD Quality - Drop your camcorder, camera if you have this phone !!- GPS - what can I say!!! It took about 8-10 seconds to get the location fix and is incredibly accurate- FM Radio - finally can listen to web/radio FM songs- Powerful WiFi antenna- Flash support for browsers - Finally a phone with real world computer like browsing experience- Interface is fast and superlative- Screen has a Haptic feedback which helps tremendously!!- Skype Integration - OMG This is the best feature ever !!!- Python !!! - N900 apps will be made using the simplest language after Basic - Python!! So hold your horses for an explosion of apps very soon..Cons:- It has a resistive screen and not capacitive so the responsiveness is not as much as the iPhone but hey, I can use a stylus... and not have to take my gloves off in COLD WINTERY DAYS!- Email client is iffy, Does not support Exchange 2003 yet but only Exchange 2007 - (an update is in the process to fix this)- Yahoo push email service is missing - I could not get folders to show up but just the inbox was able to load- Except the phone (which works in both portrait and landscape modes) everything else works only in landscape modes and again a Nokia update supposedly before the end of the year is going to fix this !- Very limited apps at this point- Weight and size - but again don't compare this to the iPhone which is stunted in features but only good on Apps that are free and mostly games!!!- No 3G for ATT .. Did not affect me since I am on Tmobile!Overall, this is one of the most promising phones that I have ever seen with so much packed into this device, I can only foresee Nokia getting a N910, 920 without the physical keyboard and cutting the weight and size of this beast which will then be the iPhone killer!!!This phone needs some getting used to and getting accustomed to. There is a certain learning curve associated with the phone, but once you cross that, the sky is the limit to what you can do with this phone!Go get it, you won't be disappointed one bit but remember that this is not for everyone so choose wisely :)..", "Date": "December 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "The joy you get out of this phone, never diminishes, even after years of holding it", "Author": "Vijay \"svijay\"", "ReviewID": "R2BAOFN9E8RAOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a Nokia N900 user for the past 1 and half years and I still love it, hence decided to give a review.1) First let me go to internet browsing.Nokia N900 is the first phone to have full flash player and the major capability is it will play videos directly in the browser, for sites like youtube, facebook etc. Once facebook moved to latest flash player, N900 is not able to play the videos(eventhough there is a hack and when you do that the videos will start playing).With respect to Nokia N900, every site determines it as a computer and hence will show the full page, instead of the mobile site, which is good, if the wifi or 3G is really good.The best part of the browsing in N900 is you can get a mouse pointer and using that you can do text selection like in system and you will be using ctrl+c to copy the text.  Using the mouse pointer you can replicate the mouseover action, which no phone in the market has, which currently only in regular computers you can do.Conclusion: with respect to internet browsing Nokia N900 is best in the market.2) Playing videos.Nokia N900 has a resolution of 800x480, hence the videos look very good.Nokia N900 can almost play any video format directly, like wmv, avi etc, including flv. I am not sure whether any other phone can do/compete with this.Conclusion: Playing videos is very good in Nokia N900.3) Camera.Nokia N900 has 5MP camera with dual LED flash.  The photos and videos look great, but there are phones in the market which are very good in this area, for example Nokia N8.Conclusion: Nokia N900 camera is not bad.4) GPS.Nokia N900 is pretty dumb in this area, as it doesn't have voice guidance out of box.There is a VERY STRONG community for N900, and the community has given the voice guidance support.Conclusion: Nokia N900 GPS is still long way to go.5) Widgets.Nokia N900 stands out with respect to widgets and its definitely the best in the industry. You can place the widgets whereever you want, even one on top of the other. Widgets are really useful in N900.  Infact Android has started going in this route just recently from Android 3.0 onwards, where you can stack the widgets.Conclusion: Nokia N900 widgets are best in the market.6) Chat and Voip.Nokia N900 stands out in this area too, as Skype worked with Nokia to have the skype integrated into the contacts. Like that, google, yahoo, even sametime all are integrated into the contacts itself. You just need to go to contacts to see who is online. You can call that contact through various options, like gsm call or voip call using skype or skype to skype call or skype to skype video call, same way for google, yahoo etc. It is very powerful, none of the mobile has it integrated like this.  Infact, eventhough Android is google's operating system, they don't have google talk video call in Android, but N900 is the only phone, which has google talk video call too.Here comes the best part, imagine you are online in all the chat softwares for example skype, gtalk, yahoo etc, you can set to show your location.  It uses the internal GPS to know your location and it propagates to everyone who sees you online.  In your friends chat software, next to your online status, it will show your complete address.Conclusion: Nokia N900 is the best in Chat and Voip in mobile phones.7) Social networks.Nokia N900 has beautiful widgets and integration to contact as well. You can configure all your accounts, say Facebook, twitter etc in N900 and the beauty is after that it does lot of potential things.  For example, it will bring all your friends in Facebook and show it in your contact list and when a particular friend changes his/her profile picture, that will get reflected automatically in your phones contact picture.  It doesn't stop there, if a friend is online in facebook, it will show that status in your phones contact book.  Further to this, you take a photo and you can immediately post it into facebook from the photo application itself.Conclusion: Nokia N900 is very powerfull and unimaginable in social network capabilities.8) Bluetooth.Nokia N900 has the usual bluetooth version and it works good even with A2DP.Conclusion: Nokia N900 bluetooth is good.9) Battery life.Nokia N900, in line with all the other powerful smartphones, with all the widgets constantly checking the internet and all the chat softwares too constantly checking internet, it comes for 75% of the day and you need to charge it after that.Conclusion: Battery is not that good in N900.10) FM transmitter and internet radio.Nokia N900 is outstanding in this area. If you search in internet and you manage to get your popular radio stations URL, you just need to grab the URL and provide it in the media player, then N900 can stream your radio station live from internet either using wifi or 3G, which means even if you are in any part of the world, you will be able to hear your favourite radio station live. Using the build-in FM transmitter, you can transmit to your own car radio at particular frequency that you set.Conclusion: FM transmitter is really good, internet radio concept is unique.11)  Multiple operating system with dual/tri bootingNokia N900 is like a computer, you can install multiple operating system like Meego, Android etc in memory card and will be able to have dual booting, where in computer it offers you to decide, which operating system you want to boot, similar way N900 offers that.Conclusion: Nokia N900 is so unique in this.12)  Infra red portNokia N900 has a infrared port.  Since the community is very strong, they gave applications to control your tv(remote control for tv) and they gave applications to control your camera.  Now you will be able to imagine the possibilities of this infrared port.Conclusion: Nokia N900 is one of the best in infrared port.13)  RSS feedsNokia N900 has very good support for RSS feeds.  It even has a widget, where you just see the headlines and if you wish to read more, you click it and go to the actual news in a browserConclusion: Nokia N900 is one of the best in RSS feeds.14) Last but not least, the Maemo communityThis is the best I have ever seen.  The applications that they give for N900, we can only dream of.  Infact this community really takes the N900 to the next level.I hope, I covered the review of some distinct features apart from the usual ones.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Its  a a good phone but Nokia could have done better", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RXJOPUOA590VJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned the N900 for sine June of 2010. Before that I owned the Nokia E71. Switching over from the E71 to the N900 gave me mixed feelings about this phone. For starters the N900 packs more hardware and software features then the E71, but from a practical  use percpective(meaning you soley rely on this phone) it comes a bit short.What I like about the N900 is the 3.5 touch screen, its multitasking capabilities, and integrated skype feature which is nice to use if you have relatives overseas, because skype to skype calls are free.  Finally what I like about Nokia is its a worldwide and if you go abroad it should be easy to find parts such as new battery or charger.What I hate about the N900 is its battery life. I take off the phone from the charger at 10am I might use the phone for an hour or two and by 12 am the battery is almost dead. What is suprises me is that the E71 had a 1500ma battery with half the screen size and processing power of the N900. While the N900 has a 1300ma battery. I went to Mugen's website [...] power and I got the 2400ma battery, it comes with a back cover and extended battery. The battery ships from Hong Kong, but now with the extended battery I can go two days without charging the phone. If you plan on getting the extended battery its going to make the phone as thick as a  100s pack of kings ciggaretes. The back cover does not have a kickstand nor does it have a cover for the camera. It has an on off switch to turn on the camera. The reason for the switch is that the orginal cover uses a magnetic stripe when you open the camera cover it makes the camera turn on.Words of advice to N900 users:1. If you download allot of apps on the N900 it will slow down the phone. Especially if the apps are running in the background. You can get more applications in the application manager by going to extras developers catelog, the problem with this catelog is its more for testing, some applications will work fine, others will jam the operating system up, and make it unstable. If you do experiment with it you can uninstall the app. If that doesn't work reflash the device. Instructions for reflashing the device can found online, but the way their written is more focused on a programmer audience.2. Another word of advise if you plan on buying a carrying pouch get one without magnets, because everytime I bought a case in which used magnets to secure the device in the pouch it would unlock the phone, and thats primarily caused by the magnetic switches that are used to tell the device whether the keyboard is open or not.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's a \"mobile computer\" that functions as a phone!", "Author": "Mohammed K.

So why would you want to have Nokia N900?- Storage capacity. A massive 32GB flash memory built-in AND you can add a memory card, making it 48GB.- Multitasking. There is no other match for multitasking on the N900. 4 desktop views, background tasks.- Full html web browsing with ADOBE FLASH support.

Dougherty", "ReviewID": "R1KMQH6KW7KGUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nokia has marketed and represented this \"phone\" appropriately -- that is, as a \"Phone/Mobile Computer\" -- a phone, and a mobile computer, at least in equal parts.  If you want a phone that offers fantastic \"phone\" functionality in terms of great speaker volume during conversations, easy dialing, missed call lists, voice mail, crystal clear call quality with fantastic battery life, then definitely, without a doubt, look elsewhere.This device is all about give and take.  It does things that no great \"phone\" can do, and not even dream of doing, fantastically well.  That is, the N900, with the right operator, can be at least 90% as functional and useful as a lap top computer but with the total mobility that comes with a cell phone.For example, the N900 will render web pages in full \"standard computer\" format without any compromise, and do it beautifully without any hiccups on its 16 million color display.  The N900's independent GPU and super fast processor speed up flipping through menus and rendering graphics SUBSTANTIALLY.  In fact, I have never witnessed a phone that comes as close to true \"laptop\" web browsing and functionality, all while having the convenience of a tablet interface. It's as simple as that.Also, while there are definitely lag problems with the e-mail client that comes standard with the N900, it can certainly be argued that A) despite some delay, the e-mail client works well functionally speaking, and B) it renders e-mails in a great format that, again, mimics a laptop much more than any mobile phone I've ever used.  As a professional who needs access to e-mail, and, almost as importantly, attachments and links contained within those e-mails, this phone does substantially better than any other comparable device (and I've owned or used MANY of them -- from the iPhone, to the MotoQ/Droid, etc., you name it).The widgets and programs that come with the N900 are also well designed and functional.  Without getting into extreme detail, all of the programs and widgets I've used so far operate very smoothly, and very, very quickly.  Using the Maemo OS, you can flip through windows at lightening speed with no delays or hiccups, and run dozens of programs simultaneously without any noticeable slow down.  While there are admittedly a limited number of programs and widgets available right now, really, there is a Maemo equivalent \"app\" for all of the main, most popular iPhone Apps.  If you want the equivalent of the iPhone App that is specifically for finding the closest vintage record store so that you can congregate with other Apple d-bags, you are out of luck, sorry.  For the rest of us, every program you want or need you have access to.So, here is a summary:Pro:-Blazing fast speed in the operating system-Email client that allows you to view e-mails in a nicely laid out format with all access to links and attachments.  Great for professionals.-Widgets and programs that have been developed that are useful and entertaining-Very high quality components and build; a signature of Nokia phones.  They are simply head and shoulders above any other phone manufacturer in quality, ESPECIALLY Apple.-Great internet integration, and if you are willing to switch to T-Mobile (I did with no problems), very fast 3G utilization.-Surprisingly wide range of compatibility given that Maemo is such a unique platformCons:-Hiccups and slowdowns with e-mail and phone functions, but these are generally tolerable and hopefully will get better with firmware updates.-Limited number of programs and widgets available.-If you don't know how to control battery consumption, watch out, because you will be charging this phone a LOT.-Expensive and not (yet) available through a service contract.-Not as user-friendly as competitive devices, such as the iPhone (though that's about the only place the iPhone wins, and honestly the N900 is arguably MORE user friendly to the moderate to highly tech savvy community).The bottom line is that you NEED to research what you are getting into before you buy this phone, because if you're just buying this because it's the newest, latest, greatest phone, especially if you are coming from an iPhone that you loved for its ease of use, watch out, because you will probably be frustrated with this device (at least at first).  Like any great tool, in order to maximize its use, this device really depends on an operator who knows what s/he is doing.  So just read up, research, and then enjoy what is a great product from Nokia.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Maemo-rable Phone Experience!", "Author": "N. Goehring", "ReviewID": "R2PQP71TYEXDE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my N900 earlier this month after having spent a good couple of months comparing and fretting about it.  After all, almost $600.00 is nothing to just toss to the wind.  I am extremely happy to report that I have not been let down. This phone does it all!  Yes, the phone is new so things there are things that need to be fixed with firmware updates, but the point is, Nokia is doing just that.  A trip to the forums shows all sorts of entries of things people don't like or would like better and Nokia is actually implementing many of the suggestions.  I was able to come home with the phone, update the firmware over my WiFi connection, and have not experienced any of the reboots or other complaints made so far.  Yes, the number of applications available for the phone is on the slim side.  But what do you friggin expect?  How long has the iPhone been around?  In the time that I have had the phone (less than a month) I have noticed that the number of apps available to be installed increases almost daily.  Once again, I have to add that a visit to the forums will show all sorts of apps in development.  You can even put one that is still considered in development on your phone and fire it up if you are daring.  For the time being, there appears to be a formidable number of people developing away on the device.  Pretty cool to me.What I like most of all, is that I can do what I want with the phone.  Unlike iPhone, I am not forced to go with a certain provider.  The apps are not controlled by Nokia so people are free to develop whatever they want with no \"holds\" whatsoever.  If YOU like the app, YOU install it, if not, no worries.  Need to replace your battery?... no worries.  Unlike the iPhone, you can actually get to it without having to break the sucker open.  Perhaps the best summary for what makes this phone awesome is the fact that it comes with an IR port on it.  Nokia didn't develop any software that actually uses the port so you might think, WTF are they thinking?  The answer is, they were thinking ahead.  They provided hardware that wasn't actually \"necessary\" for the phone to work, and, once again, allowed us as the users and developers to do what we want with it.  For a manufacturer to provide you with \"unnecessary\" hardware is pretty rare.  For one to empower you to make it work as you want it to is almost non-existent.  In the current environment of DRM and other controls that make me feel like things I buy with my money don't even belong to me, this phone is a fresh breath of clean air.  Could it be better?  Sure.  Can you think of ANYTHING you have ever bought that you couldn't say that about?  I doubt it.  I feel that I have made minimal compromises with the product and that in the future, Nokia or other developers will provide the fixes to make this phone even better.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "great phone... worthy apps...", "Author": "Michael A.

The phone works perfectly on European 3G networks.I'm a person who always tends to buy the cutting edge mobile tech, and I've been very satisfied with the phone. The Maemo community has been churning out a lot more apps than I expected from such a niche product. This makes me very hopeful for future Nokia phones also. I can honestly say that the only app or game that I've missed is a proper SportsTracker app.Integration of contacts to all kinds of social networks, skype, google talk etc is flawless and surprisingly useful. The phone is quite responsive unlike some older Symbian phones. The UI is easy to get a hang of and is rather intuitive. I've found myself wondering why some of the features haven't been implemented in Windows, such as minimizing apps to the background by clicking outside the window.The phone is somewhat bulky, partly due to the physical qwerty keyboard and carl zeiss camera lens. The camera is good enough for snap and shoot photos. IMO noticeably better than e.g.any iPhone. On par with Samsung Galaxy. The keyboard is by far the best I've used (compared to other Nokias, other manufacturers, including physical and virtual keyboards).I do prefer a slimmer phone, but this phone has convinced me to get the next Maemo/Meego phone rather than Android or iPhone (depending on price of course) as my next phone.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Phone - A Techie's Dream", "Author": "Isaac", "ReviewID": "R1G860LQ3G86RE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I should start out by saying that I am a software developer, and all of my personal computers run linux. I wanted a phone that matches my status as a total geek, and the N900 is exactly that. It runs ARM Debian as the operating system, making it simple to program applications for. Unlike Android, which just uses the linux kernel, the N900 can run a full linux desktop with any program you can imagine! Firefox, GIMP, and, hey, I've even used Eclipse on it (although I wouldn't recommend it; the processor just isn't fast enough, but it's still a fun proof of concept). That, plus the built in FM transmitter, IR blaster, and (of course) GPS, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi makes this phone a techie's dream phone.But, even if you aren't an absolute nerd, I would STILL recommend getting this phone. The user interface is the best I've ever seen (and I work with a lot of cell phones). Everything seems well integrated; for example, instead of using a \"Facebook App\", you take a picture, then click \"Share via Facebook\", and instead of a \"Skype App\", you click a contact and select \"Call via Skype\". Speaking of Skype, this phone has a front camera that can be used for Skype video calls (and not just on Wi-Fi).The only downside is the form factor; this phone is slightly thicker than I would like it to be (but it also feels more durable with that). Definitely has crime-deterrent (if you know what I mean), but that's not even such a big deal when you consider what this phone offers.Also, for better or worse, the phone has a physical slide-out keyboard. I came from a phone using an on-screen keyboard (with Swype), so I found that typing is noticeably slower (although, the word completion helps to alleviate that). Another advantage of this is the ability to type at any time; for example, if you start typing letters at the home screen you start a contact search, and if you start typing numbers at the home screen you start dialing those numbers. Also, in most applications, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V works as copy and paste, and Ctrl-A works as select all. These shortcuts work even in places you would least expect them to, for example, Ctrl-A will select all of your Emails in the Email app.Overall, I'm definitely satisfied with the phone, and I don't hesitate to give it five stars.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Small learning curve, but totally worth it!", "Author": "Andy H.", "ReviewID": "R35EZJN4ZHID9W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using the Nokia N900 for a little over a week; (Amazon shipped it very quickly, btw). I have always owned Nokia mobile phones, and I've always done my research when parting with a substantial amount of money for any product. It was no different with the N900. So I was well aware of the 'learning curves' people had experienced, and mine was also a small learning curve, but a learning curve nevertheless.Let me start by saying I love this phone. It does everything I wanted in a mobile, and more. Yes there are some necessary caveats to go with this phone because it is quite a different set up to what one might be used to, even a Nokia fan. Yes I did have to download a few things and install them, just to get it up to the usual 'Nokia standard' for things like a few more different Profiles (only General and Silent are available), and Picture Messaging (MMS) which isn't built-in at all, but can be with a little app called fMMS. But why Nokia decided to leave basic things like this off one of their phones is a mystery to me. But not a big problem either.One of the best things I like is being part of the Maemo online community. Maemo is the operating system of the phone, and the maemo dot org community is an amazing collection of owners and/or developers who answer your questions quickly and informatively. You quickly learn that this isn't your run-of-the-mill Nokia handset, but a one-off device that has an interesting open-source OS, which naturally lends itself well to having thousands and thousands of interested people to connect and discuss with. Maemo is soon to be 'outstepped' by MeeGo, a Nokia and Intel venture, but that story is for 2011.Maemo is a great OS, and it is quick, fun and easy to grapple with. I say easy, but only if you can accept that sometimes you might have to think beyond ABC and green button/red button simple user interactions. You have to learn that, for example, tapping on the top left corner of the menu screen brings you back to the desktop/dsahboard, even though there is nothing there to press! Not even an icon! You have to learn that the icon made up of 6 little sqaures takes you to the menu, the icon with the 2 larger sqaures (these are in the same spot, upper left) takes you back to your open applications. I can see this sort of thing being an impossible nightmare to explain to somebody's grandparents or to somebody that isn't the sharpest tool in the box, but for most people with a brain that they use often, it's a piece of cake. Once you've learned that this is how it works, you're all set.Other PROS:>> Superb hardware, no cheap feeling at all (hardly ever with Nokias and this is no exception). A good feel in the hand, top quality.>> Excellent call quality and loud speaker. Very clear voices on calls.>> Touch-screen is bright and responsive. It's resistive, not capacitive, so no pinch-zooming, but it responds well.>> Keyboard makes it a dream to text or email. The on-screen keypad is an added bonus, I don't use it much, but it's also very responsive.>> The 4 scrollable desktops are cool and easy to customize (widgets, shortcuts etc)>> Typing emails and texts is an enjoyable breeze. Texts are placed in a Blackberry-style Conversations folder, so your back-and-forth texts with Derek can be seen and read easily all on one pane, but your texts with George are on a different pane - really easy to understand and use.>> Great apps (ones you actually find useful, not fart-noise apps, or apps that are just web links) via both ovi store and the Maemo sites. Plenty of tested, trusted apps that will please basic users like me (games, spirit level, flashlight type apps) and more complex, programmer-type apps. All free (so far!)>> After learning how to navigate, Ease of use is definitely there in the Pros section. It just looks so cool!>> Connection to my laptop (either via USB or Bluetooth) works just fine for transferring files and backing up contacts, etc. Ovi Suite for PC works well with the N900 - but I'm still waiting for the Mac version. Don't they have Macs in Finland??!>> Amazing web experience. It's the closest to using the web on a computer, and it's fast.Some CONS:>> Battery life is not great. There are some things users have advised me to do (thanks to the Maemo community for these tips!) that have extended the battery life a lot. Tinkering with some settings so that the 3G connection is only active if I want it (say for accessing the web) and the same for the WiFi connection. Switching the screen off as soon as I'm done using it and not having loads of widgets running in the background. If you don't tinker like that, expect about 8 hours of medium use, less if you're doing a lot, like surfing the web. I've bought a 2nd battery just in case and I top-up charge via my work pc with the USB lead.>> No paper user manual (ok, we can all be 'green' and use the pdf version but I had to assume there was one, and luckily there is!) But nowhere in the box does it say, \"Visit www blah Nokia blah slash blah and download the PDF from here.\" A bit annoying, seeing as there is actually PLENTY to learn.>> Lack of simple things like MMS, automatic switching to portrait mode for everything (it's ok for web and phone mode), profiles and a Search tool (although all these things CAN be done by downloading apps and tinkering. It's just that many people wouldn't want to bother with any of that nonsense, and would prefer it all to be there straight out of the box, and after using Nokia phones for this many years and paying $400 for the N900, I kind of agree with them.>> No actual, official Google apps, but the Nokia email program works just fine with Gmail. No Google Maps app either, you're stuck with using Google Maps via the webpage, or Nokia Maps...>> Nokia Maps. Awful. Well not completely awful, but put side-by-side with just about every other Nokia phone from the last 2 years, and it's a joke. There is no voice navigation on the N900's Nokia Maps, and it hasn't even been updated. Which is not the same story with, say the N97 or even the E75, which both have version 3 (I think) and voice turn-by-turn. BUT there is a program called Mobile Maps (inc. voice instructions) you can download for the N900, but it's about $60. Boohoo, unfair.Overall, once you get past the first few days with plenty of \"Oh! That's cool!\" and \"Ah, THAT'S how you do that,\" moments, you can't help but love the N900. It's a great looking phone that does almost everything else other smartphones do, but being open source is great because if some bright geek comes up with a great app, you can have that for free, rather than being prescribed it by the big corporation.Bottom line: It's well made, works quickly and effectively and is fun to use. If you want something a little different but that is still an excellent interface and experience, the Nokia N900 is for you. If you have trouble programming a DVR or a microwave, I'd stick with those $30 phones if I were you!  :)", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great phone for Non-Iclones", "Author": "Bentech", "ReviewID": "RE0SQ3LBQ9D8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a gadget freak since the days of Windows CE, Palm Pilots and Ipaqs. I have always liked the idea of having a computer in the pocket. But in those days, I had to carry a PDA in one pocket and a cellphone in the other pocket. As the smartphones evolved, I found myself with a single device but not as powerful as some of the devices I used to carry.Enter the N900. First the warning. If you're an Iclone, you're probably not going to be happy with this phone. First of all, it's bigger than that cute phone you're used to showing off at the coffee shop with the Cheetah skin cover. I have an Otterbox case and it easily fits in any pants or shirt pocket, but some reviewers allude to it as being bulky. I don't understand this. I certainly didn't have to renew my gym membership in order to use it but I guess some people are out of shape.The Maemo OS does take some getting used to but is smooth and efficient once you get up to speed. Here and there you may have an extra key stroke where your Jobs-Phone had a single click, but if you're intelligent enough to use this phone, you're intelligent enough to figure out how to quickly modify it to suit your needs.And modification is the key here. Starting with an open source platform (linux-based) that allows for all types of app development (that don't require a federal judge's approval), the N900 is a powerful computing device. Access to the Linux shell is easy with the Xterm application. In addition, there is the Easy Debian application that allows you to run a seamless Linux OS on your computer. This is a device that begs for hacking and provides you with the tools to do so. I've seen N900 run everything from Mac OS to Android.Even if you're not a geek, you'll love the simplicity of the N900. There are 3 methods of input (touchscreen, stylus and Qwerty keyboard). It doesn't matter what your preference is, it's always nice to have options. Due to the open source nature of the platform, there are tons of apps available for it. And it is really an internet tablet with phone features. Browsing the internet is a breeze on this baby  especially since Nokia doesn't believe in the obsolescence of Flash (hint, hint). It can be used as a webcam with it's front facing camera. And the 5 megapixel camera takes wonderful shots. With 32 gigs of memory and an optional microSDHC slot that will accept up to 32 gigs more (that's right 64 gigs at your fingertips), you can store movies and songs just like that other phone.All in all, this is a great phone.

Other power apps i've downloaded are a TI-83 graphical calculator clone--a device that costs $100--for free. Of course, if the app doesn't exist then YOU can make it yourself... although you will need some programming skills. The internet is nearly flawless on the N900. Keyboard is simple and easy to use, 5mp camera takes great photos and video and the navigation is done well (also free). Skype is built in the phone so you don't even have to use your provider minutes if you have 3G or WLAN nearby. I have yet to play with video conferencing but the potential is there. Music and vids sound and look good but other apps exist if the defaults are not to your liking. There's tons of memory space with 32gb built in and 16gb expansion via microSD card. Four desktops are customizable to which you can add widgets, app shortcuts or web links. Not enough can be said about this device's capabilities. Don't forget that it's also and unlocked GSM phone that you can use overseas too!Cons-A bit bulky in comparison to other phones it's size (pretty thick)...not the biggest screen on the market compared to the EVO4 or new DROID...phone call UI could be a little better; No HDMI output but I really have no use for that at this point.

I never used IOS or Android for more than just playing at the store so cannot really compare to them but N900/Maemo5 is a joy to use coming from a non-touch-screen S60 phone. I find it intuitive and very responsive. The touch-screen works just fine around the phone interface despite being resistive, there is an occasional hiccup or two in the browser but not too bad, I can live with that. The Skype/IM integration is truly amazing. Camera is great and so is the instant picture sharing through Flikr and Facebook out of the box. I actually expected this phone to be difficult to use after reading many negative reviews but it turned out not to be the case. Yes, app support is lagging if that's what you're after, but there is enough supply to make this device even more powerful than it is out of the box. Despite running on the last year's hardware I think this is still one of the best phones on the market if you need a little more of a computer out of your phone, and with the recent price drops it is the best value as well considering it comes with 32Gb of storage (expandable to at least 48) and no expensive contract to sign. It is a somewhat thick, but A a full QWERTY keyboard (love it) is a reasonable excuse for that.

I feel like, outside of Apple, they have a great grasp of what people WANT to do with their phones, even before they consider what a person CAN or SHOULD do.  The n900 is a great example of this.  And, as others have noted, it is a little ungainly, but it is truly a moment where Nokia decided \"we'll work out the kinks as we go along\" and released a very powerful device with a very open design in the hopes that the community could make it work. Not even a full year out, and already the n900 is in much better shape than what you would have gotten when it was first released (and the price has come down!)If you've read the specs, you know that this phone comes with two cameras built in, the very good rear camera, as well as the much smaller front camera.  At the moment there is no video chat software available... but there will be someday, and you'll already have the camera to use it properly when that software becomes available.  Its that kind of design that speaks to 'future proofing' this phone, as compared to other devices.  You are getting some hardware that is going underutilized. but given time, that will change and you'll still have a great device.I also like how it is completely \"non-commital\" as far as  cellular usage goes.  You could use the N900 without a SIM card and you'd have a pretty sweet \"micronetbook\"/media player/camera just for use on wifi networks.  Currently, I don't even have a data plan. I just use it as a phone when I'm out of range of one of my regular wifi networks (and I've checked my mobile bill to make sure that its not accessing data when it should not be.)  This makes the ATT/T-mobile debate slightly less significant, since the N900 cannot access ATT's 3G network (I still switched since T-mobile had slightly better plan pricing.)I have only limited experience with iphones, and I have to admit that the iphone does have a slight performance edge as far as launching applications.  BUT I know that part of that is because you cannot do multitasking like you can on this phone.  You can be downloading new apps, browsing the web and listening to music all at the same time.  You have your choice of multiple browsers (Firefox, the N900 built in browser, Chromium (the open source version of Chrome) you get a true command line (and you can even gain root access if so desired.) VPN, VNC, you can even use telnet if you wind up back in 1993 for some reason.The touch screen is amazing to view, and is quite responsive.  The fact that it is resistive compared to Apple's conductive touch response really is just a different style and not something that I worry about.  The only issue with touch accuracy has to do with developers designing apps/websites with very small links and buttons, but that would be an issue regardless of the ability of the screen to register. The included stylus is a nice touch, especially  if your hands are a little dirty or say, if you're wearing gloves.  And speaking of response, the physical keyboard is a great feature.  I like not sacrificing viewing space when I type.  My only wish is that the F and J buttons had more pronounced textures so you could feel a little better where your thumbs were in relation to other buttons (I may be the only person who references home row when typing with my thumbs, but go fig)The \"conversation\" feature aggregates all your various texts, IMs, calls (even VOIP) and emails into one place so that you can instantly jump into the flow of a conversation.  It kind of parallels the robust contact features and allows another means of keeping up with multiple streams of contact at one time.  With a few app downloads these conversations can branch out into Facebook chat, Twitter, wordpress/blogs, smoke signals (j/k).  BTW, practically all downloads for the N900 are free, due to the virtue of Maemo being an open source OS.Finally, I'll just talk about how awesome this device is as a media player.  The large internal storage means I can ditch my old Zen (a 32 GB device) and now just use the N900 for video/audio playback.  There's no extra software to load on the computer (no itunes!), you just connect the USB cable and press \"mass storage\" on the N900 when it registers the connection.  You then can browse the n900 on the computer like a normal USB hard drive (drag and drop, FTW!). It accepts standard headphones and actually comes with a pretty good pair of headphones that also function as a handsfree headset.  They are actually good enough to warrant replacing if they ever get lost.  You also get an A/V out cable that can connect to virtually any TV (standard RCA male connection to the TV) and, yes, it can output in PAL and NTSC (speaking of international capabilities this thing has a ton of built in languages supported, and the built-in dictionary/spell checker can support two languages at once, even more language packs can be downloaded through the app manager).  As if that wasn't enough, it also has a built-in FM tuner, an IR port for sending commands like a universal remote as well as the ability to sync via bluetooth (not to mention the ability to tether your phone to your computer.)  In all of this connectivity awesomeness, the one flaw is that Nokia has a proprietary USB port, so if you lose your charger or the USB cable, you have to buy one that fits a Nokia N900 (and an assorted few other Nokia devices) there are third party manufacturers, but its just one more connector shape you have to be aware of.I will say that battery life can be an issue, expecially if you plan on having 3G connectivity and do a lot of browsing then buying a second battery is practically required.Since the N900 hasn't turned into a smashing success for Nokia, the community of users is fairly small. While they are industrious at building porting apps to the device, it is nowhere near as big as Android or Apple's app marketplaces.  There is an interesting possibility of installing Android on the N900, but that is still some time off right now.Hopefully this lengthy review has given you a sense of what the N900 can do.  If you are an advanced computer user with a passing familiarity with Linux, you will enjoy this device.Update:  over the months, it has come out that Nokia is not going to be pursuing further development of the Maemo OS. HOWEVER, that does not mean that the n900 is a \"dead\" product.  In all likelihood it will be one of the first to get Meego, the new OS being supported by Intel and Nokia, as well as open source developers around the world.  Meego is not yet ready for use (though you can download an alpha version if you want to essentially not have a phone anymore :P) but it is an exciting development for open source mobile software, and hopefully a viable alternative to Android and iOS.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Thinking of buying the N900? Do your research.", "Author": "Enigma", "ReviewID": "R2JJXS7V5F071U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "[Edit - Jan 24, 2010 Update:Two firmware updates a couple weeks ago so after testing, time for an update: If you NEED bluetooth like I do and don't plan to carry two phones/devices to have bluetooth available, read on.So little progress has been made and I have seen far too many bugs/enhancements closed as WONTFIX that I am dropping this to 1-star based on current state, 2 updates and price to value in comparison with other devices that have launched/will launch in the next month or so. I'll change the rating depending on next update - length of wait will be factored in. I see a lot of bashing for people who give low reviews so I expect I'll hear about this.I'll start by quoting Nokia from bug 6766 regarding bluetooth problems on the phone. This came after the major PR1.1 update:\"As far as making all issues go away, I don't think that's physically possible since Bluetooth and WLAN share the same antenna in the N900. Some WLAN operations, such as searching for access points, take over the antenna almost completely.\"All the bluetooth bugs still exist, some are made worse by PR1.1.Note: regardless of what people say, there is NO way, zero, none, nada, to turn off the wifi radio via graphical interface. You can probably do so via CLI if you are very advanced with Linux and not worried about re-flashing, but that's not practical. You can take several steps to make it \"less active\", but it is still running - easiest to see is choose \"Internet Connections\" from the status area and it will show all wifi APs even though you think it is disabled. Nokia closed an enhancement request to allow customers to fully disable the wifi radio as WONTFIX.The major update of the two, known as PR1.1, was eagerly awaited and expected to fix a lot of problems including the well known, very active, bluetooth bugs. Nothing I listed has been addressed and the firmware addressed a few minor things overall-nothing major. Important to note that the manifest list posted for PR1.1 lists A LOT of bugs as fixed that were actually fixed before the phone was released. I have noticed a lot of people's tones have changed since the disappointing update.PR1.1:Bluetooth: The PR1.1 update did help some who had a lot of issues with 'stuttering' on bluetooth (music and calls). For most of us, it didn't. One person who initially seemed happy and said he'd live with it came back a day or two later and said it's not fixed. Long story short, read bug 6766 on maemo's bug site. For me and others, PR1.1 has increased disconnections to a point that I don't bother trying to use BT now. It essentially disconnects immediately. When I was testing PR1.1, a couple times the connection lasted several minutes, but the majority is instant disconnect. If you need bluetooth, I would hold off.Portrait mode: They are working towards it, that's good. The browser has a partial implementation now (it's nice for one handed reading, good formatting, but not complete). Tip: you have to hit a combination of shift+ctrl+O to activate it; it works with keyboard slider in only. To disable, shift+ctrl+O again. However, I have 'remnants' of the future with my desktop sticking in portrait randomly requiring a restart. Not a huge deal unless you are in a hurry to make a call.USSD codes: The *#nnn#nnnnnn# to do many controls on your phone like say, enable full forwarding since it is not available in the interface or check prepaid balance, etc. etc. They fixed a couple codes: show your IMEI and show the software version (both available in settings | 'about phone' right next to each other). They closed this bug as fixed - a lot of very unhappy people on this one. I think Nokia (well, probably Maemo since they don't know phones yet) really underestimated how important this is - it is clear from the huge bug thread that a lot of the codes people need are surprising to them.Maps: It starts up a little quicker. A few minor tweaks that aren't worth mentioning. I was hoping I could at least do routing to an address. You can, but open your browser and go to google maps.Anything else I don't mention, there is nothing to mention. It was an underwhelming update that decreased battery life further, addressed several small issues. Some had ZERO votes and only 1 person involved with the ticket and it was very small - e.g. RDS name in the FM transmitter???. Clearly poor prioritization.Other stuff: The battery charges much faster now, but it also drains much faster. There are some great apps starting to show in the pipeline. A lot of hard work from the community going on and new things are showing up daily in devels and testing repositories. They just aren't hitting extras (production) fast enough.BTW - my review is not meant to be 'negative' - I am simply stating known issues that a potential buyer may not know. I just haven't repeated the positive or taken the speculative position of hoping to see the potential realized. My intent is very simple: provide a different view that isn't one of infatuation that simply repeats the specs on the Nokia site. Provide information that would have had me think twice before purchasing. I know what you might be thinking: would I repurchase it now? No. Not then and not now.End update]---------------------------I've had the N900 over a month so I'm familiar enough with the N900 now to write comfortably.I had high expectations and loved the N900 for the first 2-days. Every day since I've grown more disappointed. I should have sent it back for a refund w/in the first couple weeks (pre-ordered from Nokia). But, I was optimistic on the potential, which has withered as I've watched Nokia/Maemo do not-so-amazing things on [...]. The N900 is not complete - not even close. They've left out a lot of what we have grown to love and expect with other current smartphones (this really doesn't qualify as a tablet). Time on[...] has me very discouraged. They are very focused on Maemo 6 and it's obvious they consider Maemo 5 primarily in maintenance mode.I am still amazed that they released the N900 as is. Bugs, I expect, but I didn't expect it to be missing some very basic features that are now standard. I also didn't expect them to turn actual bugs into low priority enhancements or completely dismiss them as \"WONTFIX\".---------------------------------------Some quotes from Maemo/Nokia on [...]:If the reporter expects the feature to be officially supported then it is a WONTFIX [common comment]I think I can resolve this as WONTFIX entirely, since the feature can be perfectly covered by the community. [This is to create a function to disable/enable wifi]Isn't \"Settings -> About\" a more user-friendly way to look up the same? [This is about the lack of support of using USSD codes - simply weird]---------------------------------------One review mentioned it's built with steel, aluminum, rubber and plastic. Wish I could find more than plastic. It is very 'plasticky', feels fat, heavy and it looks cheap - nothing like the picture. It looks & feels like a digital camera you might have purchased 5-years ago. How did DROID get essentially the same internals into such a thin form factor and Nokia managed to make it look 10-years old?There are many positives about the N900 (and it does have strong *potential*). Many were written about. I won't re-write them. However, I will note many 'gotchas' that you would not expect from a 'flagship' phone from any manufacturer. The aggregate of the gotchas add up to borderline unusable (in my opinion). I'm not going to list everything, but will put down what would have me think twice about buying. I should have waited for an update or two. I can't say it looks promising though.Below are known issues. One is not confirmed by Maemo/Nokia, but the majority are WONTFIX or being left to the \"community\" (i.e. not Maemo/Nokia) - with a couple pushed for *consideration* for Maemo 6 (Harmattan). Bluetooth they \"think\" may be fixed in a future update. USSD codes they seem to be looking at (but haven't seen a confirmation of fix).I have noticed Nokia leaves it for the community to implement many basic features. Why would they bother with basic features for one of the most expensive phones out there? Even if you want an open platform and are familiar with Maemo, you wouldn't (least I don't) expect them to push so much to be done by the community. Android doesn't take things that far - sure, it's 'mostly' open, but they package the basics with the Android builds.- OS: It appears Fremantle (Maemo 5 that comes on the N900) is essentially in maintenance mode already. I've spent weeks on[...] and watched as they apply \"WONTFIX\" to many basic features that were reported as missing, marked true bugs as enhancements and low priority (e.g. doesn't allow you to use USSD codes - *#...#), sent enhancement requests to their \"brainstorming\" site, and many requests they accept are assigned to *possible* Harmattan (Maemo 6) inclusion.What does this mean? It's possibly outdated already.- LINUX: Better know Linux. Due to the lack of settings and missing granularity in those that exist, you'll need to know Linux to make many changes/check certain settings. If you do, it's just a pain to make changes via the terminal rather than using a GUI.- SETTINGS: There are very few settings. The settings that exist have very little granularity. No easy wifi on/off, only two profiles (general and silent) with very little available to configure. Click 3-4 times just to change the display brightness. No way to set a 'home' desktop that you and I are used to -nor is there a way to get to a particular desktop easily besides using both hands and swiping. Plenty more.- BLUETOOTH: Nearly unusable. There are two major, known issues: 1) it uses the same antennae as WiFi so if you have wifi on (takes 7-steps to disable it fully), bluetooth headsets are unusable: too much static heard on both ends, A2DP music has static and pauses, file transfers run around 20kbps and disconnect often. 2) Constantly disconnects. Live in a state/country where you must use hands-free while driving? Don't like holding the phone to your ear for long calls? Want to type while on the phone? Want mobility while you talk? You can't. It disconnects anywhere from instantly to several minutes. Upon disconnection, the sound doesn't transfer to the handset. It normally takes a power cycle to get things reoriented.- WIFI: Looking for an easy way to disable wifi when not using it? Sorry, we're not talking 1-2 steps for Android or 3 for iPhone, it takes 7-steps to disable (you have to assume it's disabled - no way to tell if the radio is off and maemo/Nokia haven't said for sure) and re-enable. Reported as a bug on [...] - they consider it an enhancement, pushed it off to Harmanttle as possible inclusion and said they'll let the community write something for Maemo 5 (nothing in the pipeline as of this writing). Hope you don't need to disable/enable wifi often.- BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD: Sorry. Several other smartphones support, but the N900 doesn't. I have an N810 and many of us expected the N900 to take its place as a tablet, but with a phone. Nokia/Maemo's official response? Not supported it and it won't be. They've marked several submitted bugs on this as WONTFIX. There is a way to get a BT keyboard to pair (if you know Linux), but don't bother, it doesn't support typical PC-105 layout and only some letters will work.- LANDSCAPE: I didn't think landscape would be that bad. It supports portrait in phone (if you can get it to move to portrait), but that's it. It is a BIG pain, especially if you want to use the device with one hand. Just entering a 5-digit PIN to unlock with one hand is very difficult. It might be livable, but the implementation is very poor.- MAIL FOR EXCHANGE (MfE): Far too many bugs to mention here. Barely usable - supports HTML now, but a few steps backward everywhere else. I'll hit a few: Doesn't properly map fields (both contacts and calendar), doesn't synchronize updates properly, doesn't seem to properly support the EAS protocol in general, won't properly synch with Google's EAS implementation (they said this isn't supported), etc.- MAPS: Can't use maps without a network connection. If you download map files - still no go. Also, Ovi Maps 1.0 takes ~10-minutes (sometimes longer) to locate your position. GPS is on, but Maps shows it's not active much of the time. I've found no way to route to an address; only two options: point to it on a map or type in a city/state/country in a search dialog - can't search for an address. Very slow.  Pretty much useless unless you want to know you are sitting on the right couch. No clue what Nokia was thinking with this.- GPS/CAMERA: If you want proper geo-tagging, you'll need to buy another device. GPS on, but photo is not tagged. It will tag sometimes if you have network positioning on.- BASICS: Are you looking for standard/basic functionality that your other phones you've had over the last few years have? The N900 is missing a lot. Far too many to list, but in addition to what's already been mentioned a few are: word suggestion is poor with no auto-correct (even a standalone \"i\" is not capitalized and it doesn't work in some areas), can't use USSD codes, no unconditional call forwarding, can't select different ring tone for contacts, can't mark contacts to automatically go to VM, can't change amount of ring time before going to VM, etc.- EMAIL CLIENT: Tinymail-based (not bad). Very poor implementation and the email client is very limited. Can't highlight text and copy, doesn't synch any folder but inbox and sent (you can view other IMAP folders, but if you delete an item - it's gone for good - no synch and no trash on N900, drafts stay on phone, etc.). Maemo/Nokia are on record saying this will never happen because \"it's too complex\" (common saying[...]), but look for it in Harmattan - maybe. Doesn't auto-fill/suggest as you type a name in TO/CC/BCC. No choice to return to inbox after deleting a message - you can only view the next message.- EMAIL CLIENT: Have to confirm each and every delete. There is no option to remove confirmation. If you deal with a high volume of email, it's a big irritant. It's been submitted as an enhancement request with Nokia's current response as \"It would be interesting to how popular such request is\" :-/ Weird that such basic functionality in every email client (mobile or not) that I can think of isn't on the N900 or its roadmap.Very poor email client - worst I've seen on a mobile device in years.This doesn't include all issues, but the review is long enough.

I actually very much like the stereo sound thing thats well done.Nokia needs to get flash developers to create its apps or it never catches up with others.

ATT was who my service provider was for a very long time.  This phone was purchased without me really knowing that I couldn't get 3G speeds for data through ATT, regardless, I had planned to stick with ATT until I received terrible and frustrating customer support.  Combined with their unfair business practices, I dropped ATT and moved to T-Mobile.  I will cover that later, but first will give a little bit of a spin on ATT's business practices that I hope you take into consideration and decide to abandon ATT.  1.  ATT tries to do everything to get their customers on a contract.  I don't want to be on a contract, which is _one_ reason I purchased an unlocked phone.  In my case, I did not have any subsidized hardware and wanted to simply combine with wife under the family plan; however, in doing that, they wanted me to go on an 11 month contract, upgrade my hardware (even though I told them I didn't need to) and they wanted to take away my roll over minutes that I had accumulated (paid for).  Customer service is terrible:  you never get the same answer from two different people, you never get to speak to the same person, and always end up repeating the same information each time).  2.  DATA PLANS:  ATT no longer has an unlimited data plan.  Not a big deal for the majority of customer and I would have probably been in the same boat.  But, their change was to reduce the cost of an unlimited plan by $5 and make it limited to 2GB of data.  Current options:  $15 for 300 MB or 25 for 2048 MB (2 GB).  Explanation from ATT was that they had too many complaints from people that they didn't want to have to pay for unlimited data they were not using.  Argh!  3.  DATA PLAN IS NOT OPTIONAL:  If you get a smart phone, ATT will FORCE you to get a data plan.  Sure, some of us are content to use the enhanced features of our smartphone without a cell phone data plan (ie:  wifi when available).  With ATT you are NOT given a choice... so if you plan on staying with ATT, may as well get a subsidized phone and save some money, cause they will get it out of you regardless!  (Note:  If you are a long time ATT customer, you may be grandfathered in to not having to have this requirement, check and then check again with a supervisor if you are told otherwise... they will LIE to get you on contract.)  4.  Teathering.  The N900 works great for teathering.  I use ubuntu and it connect very easily.  Note in #2, that you are now paying for a quantity of data instead of an unlimited amount of data per device.  In order to teather with ATT, they will charge you a fee that will permit you to teather, BUT you will get no additional band width.  Data still comes from your 2GB limit (or your plan you are on).  In that case, you are being billed twice for the same amount of data.  ROBBERY!!!T-Mobile has a no contract, voice/text/data plan.  It is also cheaper than ATT.  My concern was that I would have less coverage than ATT; however, it should be noted there is no charge for roaming (voice/data) and that T-Mobile will roam on ATT networks (and vice versa).  Issue would be with Data only where you will not get 3G speeds on an ATT network because of the band that ATT uses (n900 doesn't support it).  So, I get the same coverage I had before with 3G speeds when on T-Mobile, no contract, unlimited data, and a phone that works around the world (unlocked phones do).You should be made aware that ATT phones are usually hamstrung and not only are locked (not be able to use local sim in other countries) but also have some standard features removed (ie:  Android is locked down and you can only get apps from ATT official sanctioned sources.  The teathering application is one that they have blocked).Enough of my Rant about ATT and on to N900.  My experience has been love/hate with the phone.  One needs to remember that the n900's telephone applications are new and this phones predecessors were strictly internet tablets/devices without phone features.  Consequently, I have found the phone apps, calendar, address book, and todo list are missing features I relied on when using my palm treo 650.  That said, they all work well for what they provide.  This phone also has Skype built in and it is tightly integrated with the phone / address book.  So tightly integrated that you would probably miss the feature if you didn't know it was there.  Go into this phone with the mindset that you may not have access to all of the features that we now expect from a phone; however, you are getting a vastly more powerful device in many regards that can do things no other device can do.Where the n900 shines is the power.  I can do things that I just can't do on other phones.  I can run full java applications, full versions of office applications, I can get to web sites (bar none, best web browser on any phone) that other phones cant even touch right now and get the content.  A couple of examples that are important to me:  Full version of Dropbox, Zoho Office, Yahoo Mail and prior to Hulu upgrade to flash 10, Hulu.  The open source applications are still growing and there are some very strong alternatives there.  The down side is that the Application Store doesn't have a lot of support and is missing a lot of applications that you will get for Android / iPhone.  This is just because the n900 doesn't have wide acceptance and, sadly, won't due to the future switch to MeeGo for Nokia phones.I echo most of what the previous reviewer said.  I found it to be very accurate.  I would like to note that if you have or will get this phone and your GPS just doesn't seam to lock in very fast or not at all, change the Location Server from [...].  I went from minutes on cold start to seconds.  Recommended GPS App:  Mappero.  Works well, had GPS info screen (ie: number of satelites), and is still in development.Finally, don't be turned off by the resistive touch screen (as opposed to the capacitive touch screen).  While you don't have \"multi-touch\" support, you get a feature you can't do with iPhone/Android/future MeeGo.  I can use the stylus and take hand written notes, scribble notes on a PDF document with \"ink\", etc.  If you want a device that you can actually take notes on, this is your baby.  Recommended applications:  Xournal (good, pdf notate, export final to pdf), PenPen (great and fast note taker.  More flexible & faster for writing than Xournal).  Also note, that the \"application manager\" give a tremendous access to all kinds of free applications.Keyboard is frustrating at first (i so wish I had shift, ctrl, & fn keys on both sides of keyboard), but it is infinately more comfortable than the Motorola Droid.Battery Power:  One of the set backs of this device.  As the previous reviewer noted, it eats power with 3G and wifi.  I use a application called WifiSwitcher (turns on/off the wifi) and AutoConnectionManager (disconnects idle connections -- it is configurable) to vastly increase battery life.Video Out:  Works well.  Install MPlayer though and you will be able to output most video.Would I get this phone again:  Probably.  If I didn't, then I would get a newer Android 2.2 device (not ATT subsidized due to their lock down).Hats off to Nokia for this device.  I so wish that they would put Flash 10.1 in.RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES:-- Car Charger,-- Second Battery Source (I use the Nokia DC-11, but there are others that will recharge device without a plug available -- great for long international flights when you want to watch a lot of moives with your phone or read a long e-book)  Nokia link for extra power:  [...]--  a good screen protector (The resistive screens are MUCH easier to scratch, and if dirty and using stylus/finger, watch out!)

However, if you are coming from a Symbian phone (N97, in particular) and don't mind sacrificing the abundance of apps from Ovi Store, then the N900 /might/ be for you.My previous phone was an N97 (and N95-4 prior to that). The N97 was a great idea, but ruined by poor cpu/memory hardware and a not-so-solid OS. I bought an N900 to tie me over until a MeeGo device launchs for AT&T;'s bands (or there is an unbranded/unlocked Android phone that appeals to me for AT&T;'s bands). Although I am limited to 2.5G/EDGE speeds on AT&T;'s network, I am overall pleased with the device. It does not necessarily do everything that I /want/ it to do, but it does everything that I /need/ it to do. Which is somewhat a different experience from my N97, where it did everything I wanted and needed it to do, but not very well.The iPhone is a smartphone (I use that term loosely to describe it) for the non-techie. The N97 is a smartphone for the techie. Well, the N900 is a tablet computer with telephony capability for the techie. The N900 is really a *hobbyist device* and I suspect Nokia expected the open source community to contribute and support this device.In addition to the obvious, I use my phone for email, taking pics, internet browsing, calendaring/scheduling, and navigation. It does all of that wonderfully better than my previous Symbian phones, except for navigation. The latest Ovi Maps in PR1.2 is a tremendous improvement, but no voice guidance and no native Google maps application.My only other disappointment (read: inconvenience) is the proper support for PC Suite/Ovi Suite and Windows 7 64-bit (64-bit bluetooth drivers in particular).", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good but not there yet froze a lot returned & got a nexus one", "Author": "PGram", "ReviewID": "RWNQKZ0UNAI6H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok here we go.

My N97 will be going on Ebay tonight for sure:)Here is my review about this phone so far:It is the first of its kind internet tablet offered by the biggest name in the Mobile industry, Nokia. This phone runs on the powerful Linux based operating system, Nokia's Maemo version 5.0. This significant alteration in the operating system makes it different from the rest of Nokia's phones based on Symbian OS. This handset comes with the complete package of Maemo internet browser. You can easily access Mozilla browser engine at any time and any place. The Nokia N900 also features Adobe Flash 9.4. The striking advantage of this cell phone is its provision to drag and drop numerous desktop widgets.

Yes, if you tap for a longer period, you can gain access to windows, documents, call logs and other tab based functions. It is loaded with an animated menu interface. This makes your navigation task joyful. Further, its intuitive interface allows you to multi-task within a brim of few seconds. You would find most of the web based utilities pre-installed in this cell phone. Some of the utilities are Twitter, Facebook, OVI etc. It has an inbuilt Web 2.0 network, Webmail Inbox. Let's just say, this phone is loaded with all the essential features required to make it a good replacement for your notepad.What's more? This cell phone has a sliding QWERTY keyboard which opens on the side. It offers you a resistive touch screen with a high resolution of 800X480 pixels. This device also features a camera of 5 megapixels. The camera is further upgraded with an add-on feature of F2.8 lens. These features allow you to click crystal clear and vibrant pictures.

I am by no means a techie, but this phone makes me want to learn. In addition, I have heard some complaints that this phone is too difficult to navigate, that it's not user-friendly, but I disagree. I think that those who say that must enjoy a brain-dead existence where everything is spoon-fed to them, that they must prefer not to use their brains unless absolutely necessary. Really, it's NOT that hard.My only complaint about this phone? It's not made to send pictures via text messaging. You have to use facebook or some other similar service, bluetooth, or e-mail. I wish I had been aware of this before I bought it. I did read that there is a way to remedy this, but I haven't actually tried to do it yet.I really can't complain about the OS. It's easy to use and actually pretty nice. And the fact that it is possible to run Android AND Maemo simultaneously (with some of your own tinkering, of course) sounds like a fun project to me. :)If you can live without photos via text message (I can't receive them either) then there is nothing keeping you from this phone (in my opinion). I love my n900!P.S. I purchased my phone here at amazon. I would like to say that I cannot say enough good things about amazon. I have been shopping with amazon for at least 7 years now and it's always been a good experience. The service and products are great, and when something does go wrong, amazon has always been willing and able to help. I'm an amazon Prime member and I highly recommend it (did you know that if you are a student like I am, that amazon Prime membership is free?!). Anyway, since I am a Prime member, I was able to receive this phone the very next day for the very small amount of $3.99! So for those who might never have shopped with amazon before, I highly recommend it!

Camera, keyboard, LED are MUCH better (Droid camera is poor, actually). Screen is more reactive (yes! I have many cases when Droid screen doesn't react to my fingers, while N900 does and it has fine stylus writing!). Add to it easy video out (your phone on any TV in a minute!), integrated FM transmitter (play your music in your car radio with no cables!) and IR transmitter (use as a remote).The software side is more problematic. N900 has greater potential. Plays all video and music formats (leaving iPhone and Droid way behind!). Fully integrated skype! Full browser with flash! Support of desktop apps (well, it is linux). So, if the functionality is the key, N900 is hard to beat. But interfaces are generally not as good as iPhone and android. The use of several apps is more cumbersome. The variety of apps is MUCH smaller, but surprisingly, most of the things I need, are there.So, why to I carry Droid in the US if I like N900 so much? Main reason is Google maps and navigation.

I find the form factor to be fine and like the heft. If feels solid in your hand. Others have done a good job of discussing the pros and cons of this device: it's got a great web browser, it's easy to zoom and enjoy the full web, the mail, calendar and contact apps work well together and the skype integration with the dialer is great. I haven't got into the media player or maps just yet and I'm not sure it will be around long enough for me to do so.There is one thing, in fact, that is really, really bad. I am running a Zimbra Server at work. With all my other phones I use activesync to update mail, contacts and calendars. I've successfully synced with an iPhone, Nexus One (everything but calendar), and the Droid. With the N900 however, exchange integration is very weird. Contacts and calendars work great, but the majority of the mail comes in blank. The header is there but there's no body to the messages and the from field says \"no recipient\". I did a search on the Maemo forums and others have reported the same behavior (some running Exchange server 2003 and 2007) so it doesn't appear to be strictly a Zimbra issue. I tried setting it up using IMAP which at least allowed me to read the whole message, but it was just too slow and I really have become accustomed to activesync.This phone was supposed to replace my jailbroken and unlocked iPhone as my primary business phone. I moved it to T-Mobile as I was dropping far too many calls on the \"more bars in more places just not my places network\". As it stands now, it won't. Unless I (or someone) can figure out a way to make the activesync work reliably, the phone will have to go back.Finally, there's been a bunch of discussion on whether Maemo will continue to be supported by Nokia.

Obviously, there were concerns that I hoped would be overcome once I received it. It you want to hear all the ups and downs of this phone, feel free to read multiple reviews to help make your decision.Here were my main concerns:1. The phone is too large: I read this over and over so I was surprised with how small this device actually is. My opinion is that it is about as thick as an iphone with a protective case added on. Being this is a durable phone, they end up being the same thickness when in use. Without a case, an iphone is about 2/3 the total thickness, and being that I prefer a physical keyboard, I have found this phone to be exquisite.2. It is an internet tablet with limited phone functionality:  Again, I was absolutely impressed with the phone aspect after my expectations from reviewers views. My former phone was a t-mobile dash, and it did what it needed to for me. I have not found any 'feature' missing with the phone and have been extremely impressed with voice clarity and speaker volume on t-mobile's network. Dialing is as easy as possible with the contact integration.With those addressed, I was hoping the camera would offer more. Daylight shots are amazingly good, everything I hoped for but the dual LED flash for nighttime shots is less than ideal. Still better than any camera phone I have ever had but I would bring my Canon along if I was doing a lot of dark lighting photos somewhere.To me, this phone as become my phone/ipod/computer and main camera. I use all 48GB of space for music and this phonee works flawlessly for my needs...all reviews I have read have been pretty accurate on how well the internet and media functions work.The one final item that surprised me was how well the stereo speakers work...when I am working out I no longer need to dock an ipod to listen to my music, the speakers on this phone are just as clear as the JBL dock we have.This phone is not cheap, you do need to know what your needs from a phone are before purchasing, but for a power user, this phone allows me to listen to music several hours a day while surfing the internet and receiving emails/phone calls for a full day with no issues of the battery draining.

I liked the N800 enough that I didn't really consider anything but the N900 as a replacement.A solid little device.  I would recommend it for anyone who will benefit from a Linux pocket computer/cell phone/GPS/camera.What I miss in the switch from N800 to N900:- Screen space.  Both are 800x480, but the N900's 3.5 inches really feels smaller than the N800's 4.1 inches when using Xournal or Gnumeric.  The trade-off of course is that the N900 is phone sized.What I love in the switch:- The Maemo 5 interface.  To me this feels very well thought out.  Efficient and a pleasure to use.  Settings for internet and bluetooth connections are handy.  Notifications and icons make sense.- Cellular, GPS and 5MP camera.  The N900 adds these capabilities to my pocket computer.  No more carrying four devices all the time.  And the phone's bluetooth works perfectly with Sync in my truck and with my Jabra BT125.- It's Linux.  X Terminal, ssh, Xournal and tons of other software in various repositories.If you get one:- Get 'Scout'.  It provides search capabilities in calendar, text conversations and contacts.  Makes the calendar a complete tool.- Get a bluetooth headset for easy note taking while in phone calls.  The same applied when using the N800 because a cell phone was rather small to hold with a shoulder while writing on the N800 and speaker phone is not always appropriate.- Get OMWeather if the default weather app doesn't offer your city.In my opinion Nokia has nailed it with this device.  What I don't understand is why they're so hard to find.  I couldn't get one in Canada when I was looking.  Ended up ordering through Amazon in the US and shipping to a relative's place there.

I bought this phone for my wife who manages her elearning business and I can tell you that she could not be happier. This phone is a solid performer, extremely stable and a workhorse. We have extensively made use of multiple email accounts, compatibility with MS office, skype calling and messenger. I have made calls of up to 2 hrs long over SKYPE without any performance lag. The browser is better than my iphone and other droid browsers. The keyboard is excellent for my wife's purpose since she has to type long emails.Another pleasant surprise is the excellent camera and the integration with facebook, twitter, etc through pixelpipe. The camera quality is very comparable to a point and shoot camera for outdoor and well lit indoor scenes. The video recording is excellent as well. Multi-tasking is where this phone really outshines others. I can take a 2 min video and respond to my emails while the video is uploading.There aren't as many applications available for the phone but that wasnt my purpose to begin with. The GPS is very usable for my purpose. The music player is excellent as well. I was able to add quite a few music stations and I can listen to radio from over 50 countries at the touch of a button. Did I mention the excellent stereo speakers?Improvements: I would love to have the new flash player on this phone. I am quite certain that the open source community would release one. I do wish the battery life were better but dont have problems charging the phone more than once a day. I do use my phone a lot so no complains there. I have a car charger so that takes care of it.  Overall for me, the email tool, browser, music player, skype/gtalk integration, voice calling over 3G, excellent camera and solid stable performance make it a winner over comparable Android phones.

Best $400+ I've spent in years.The Nokia N900 is visually pretty. And it just works.  The phone part is a no-brainer, combining the nicest features from the iPhone interface, and the gestures and panels of WebOS (the Palm Pre).  Yet there's none of the lag from my Symbian UIQ phone (it's FAST!) or the crashiness and endless freezing of Windows Mobile devices.  The right brain is happy, with the intuitive interface, random access, and visual process.But it makes my left brain happy too.  Mind you, the following are running without any \"hacks\" or serious wizardry: a full version of OpenOffice with support for DOC/DOCX, XLS/XLSX, powerpoint, and more. A full version of GIMP (=Photoshop). The phone auto-setup my data connection with T-Mobile, and it was easy set up home & work wifi.  Afterwards, it was easy to get the phone to sync with BOTH my personal Gmail calendar and my work Exchange calendar, but not commingle them.  Amazingly, it even lets me sync more frequently during work hours, or when I'm near a wifi connection, and less-frequently during off hours or when off wifi (which is a nice touch for those on a rate-limited data plan).Support for Skype, Gtalk, and other services are integrated. So the effect is that no matter how a call comes in, the phone just rings.No matter how a message comes in, you just read it in a thread organized under the \"conversations\" icon.The email app supports every service I've tried.Want to browse the web? It's a *full* browser with *full* Flash support (Youtube, Maxgames for the kids... etc), and not slow either.Gotta make a change on a document from work?  It's all there.Want to seriously geek out?  Run nmap and Wireshark?  It's running Debian Linux, which means your \"app store\" consists of about 35,000 applications available in various Maemo, Deb , or Ubuntu repositories.Oh, and the kids dig watching 720p/HD movies on the WVGA (800x480) screen that's visually indistinguishable from the vaunted \"Retina display\" ...and with stereo speakers.This is the phone I've been wanting for ages.Really, the only neutral/negatives are slightly cramped top row of keys on the keyboard, lack of usb-host (bluetooth makes up for it), and that Nokia is moving its Linux platforms to Redhat (Meego) from Debian (Maemo).", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "King of Multitasking", "Author": "El Barto", "ReviewID": "R1R8V3M66OUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me tell u i bought this beautiful piece of technology 8 months ago and i loved it, why did i say i loved it, cause someone stole my phone from inside of my car :( .Now i bought the same one again cause i really missed true multitasking and real web browser.

I find the virtual keyboard takes up the whole screen.  When i play my emulator games I prefer to play them using the keyboard rather than the screen.The N900 CPU is fast. It runs up to 600 Mhz. However, i overclocked it go up to 825 Mhz and this kernel is smooth and stable. I don't recommend overclocking your N900 unless you know what you are doing cause it voids the warranty.The best thing about The N900 is that you can put any videos on it and play them. It supports a lot of video formats, contrary to my Iphone 3g.Well if I continue telling you about the marvels of this high piece of tech, i'll get tired of writing.Now come the CONS. Every phone has CONS, so i'll be sincere:*Battery life... for that there is a 2g and 3g applet.  You need to switch  from 3g to 2g when you are not going to need it.

Exactly what I wanted, though. I am not a power user - I touched Linux with varying sucess at school - but I am a developer, so I love the geekness of this phone (and I say this with full pride in being a geek). I also possess the ability to read, so in case stuff goes wrong when I install too many beta-stage apps, I think I can always reset everything to fix it :DGot it two days ago, got through the OS update with no problems, and I am on my merry way customizing the living daylights out of it.The biggest plus: no vampiric contract with the US mobile providers. I don't even need a data plan, since this beauty runs on WiFi at home and at work, and that's all I need.My significant other got iPhone4 on the same day, and we engaged in a little competition. Here's the results so far:Verdict: n900 is ONE YEAR OLD, which is FOREVER in smartphone years, and I don't really care for the iPhone that much now that I have this.Details:- n900 is customizable like crazy, iPhone isn't even near; the FOUR DESKTOPS are a thing of beauty and make my little heart sing (n900 wins hands down)- the screen on the Nokia is beautiful, but on the iPhone it's like you're holding the screen, not a bulky device behind it - impressive; (tie)- the iPhone4 is heavier, LOL (or about the same, I didn't check; twice as thin but doesn't feel lighter, which is a surprise)- ovi maps sucks; I wanted to find a doctor's office nearby, and the iPhone4 does this in a few taps, and also lets you call the office; I have yet to find a way/app to do this on the Nokia; currently testing out a few apps for navigation, so far no dice; would appreciate some help from you folks who already did this (iPhone wins)- the sheer number of apps, if someone wants them all, but I don't really care [see? not a smartphone person, me] (iPhone wins, no contest)- integration with e-mail, calendar, tasks, etc - Nokia has everything I need, and I can customize stuff easily (tie)- making phone calls! - SKYPE OUT OF THE BOX (n900 ftw)- contacts: I don't know what iPhone has, but Nokia has \"merge contact\", which allows you to get contacts from your old phone, your skype, your mailbox, etc. and merge duplicates in two clicks; VERY useful; and then you have an aggregated view of the various ways you can contact your contact :D (n900 ftw)- touchscreen - iPhone is just magic, but considering that the touchscreen on the n900 is resistive (!), it's brilliantly executed; there are some problems with tapping in incorrect places, and the lag doesn't help, so iPhone wins on that one, but hey, n900 has kinetic scrolling! So in general, modulo a few little annoyances here and there, I am pleasantly surprised and quite happy with the touchscreen on the n900- usability - don't know about the iPhone (probably pretty cool), but I love how things on the Nokia are standardized - the odd menu you might be seeing in the videos is actually pretty damn intuitive and very satisfying to use (I guess it's a tie, but the flow of the menu on n900 is really lovely, and the moving between apps rocks)- multitasking! - n900 is brilliant; there is some lag sometimes, but I am doing a lot of stuff at once, so it's forgiven (iPhone, I hear, now also has it, but given that this Nokia is 1 YEAR OLDER, which is forever in phone terms, n900 wins :)- sometimes apps don't install or say they didn't install while they actualy did (iPhone is probably better), but it's a quirk, I don't care- the charge holds for a day of playing around with it (don't know about the iPhone)I could go on, but summarizing, I don't regret one bit I bought this phone (also vs the iPhone4), and this is probably the first time I don't have buyer's guilt over something which is pretty expensive.

I selected two day shipping and they did a very good job of delivering on time.The N900 is what I thought it would be and so far it is living up to my lofty expectations. The display is fantastic and the operating system (Maemo) is very responsive and fast. The OS is very stable and so far the phone has not crashed once. Although it uses a resistive display the response is very good. It's probably the best resistive display i have used.It's actually easier to use than i thought and it doesn't take much getting used to. There a few quirks in this new OS and that's to be expected i guess. For example i'm not a fan of the More icon in the menu to expand to all the available applications. I think they could have just skipped that step.The media player is also very good. Sound quality and video playback is excellent. Again there is a small quirk in the media player in that it doesn't have a manual refresh setting.

I made night and low light landscape pictures, no flash, from hand, and the quality is damn good for a phone camera. Flash is good enough to take night pictures of an object about 3 yards away. Daylight pictures - of amazing quality, especially landscapes.2) Built-in maps work off-line, which means, I don't need an internet connection to navigate. Download the maps of the area where you are going to beforehand, while you have a wi-fi or a cheap data plan, and then if you happen to not have an internet access when you are out there, you still will have the maps of the area. You'll have your GPS position on the map and still will be able to use the routing features. It's not perfect, since search of places by name will not work (search depends on internet access), but you can chose locations by pointing at them on the map. Network positioning will not work, of course, you'll have to rely on GPS only.3) I had to restart my phone just once in over 3 weeks, which I think is pretty good.4) Battery life never was a problem at all. With all the picture taking I had to recharge the phone only once in 2 days. I don't keep the GPS on all the time, only activate it as needed, which probably does the trick. I must admit that I don't text or browse uncontrollably, so probably I can be classified as a light user.5) The absence of MMS was disapponting. Normally, you always have email so you can live without it. But while travelling I found myself in a situation when I had no cheap and easy internet access for a while. So I had no email and no MMS, hence no way to share those beautiful pictures with anyone! As far as I can see, there already are some applications allowing to send MMS from N900, but I haven't tried them yet.Original review:I have my Nokia N900 for 3 days now, and I honestly don't understand complaints that the interface is not simple enough. For example, many reviews say that it's not so intuitive how to switch to a phone call mode, and that you need to use both hands to do it. Actually, it's very easy: select an option which launches the phone application each time the  phone is turned into a portrait mode - and voila! - the phone launches itself with the wave of your hand. If that is not easy enough, then I don't know. I didn't have any problems with the interface at all. From my point of view, it's very intuitive. I must admit though that I am a professional programmer, and it kind of helps.Other than that, I guess I agree with the majority of reviewers.Pros: all hardware is just excellent. I didn't see specs like that for any other phone. As far as I could see, all the hardware really works as expected. Interface very nice and completely customizable. I like the way the Contacts are organized and managed. VoIP is integrated, contacts from Skype are imported into the regular phone book - very convenient. Nice main camera. Browsing perfect. Email perfect. Unlocked, which means that I can buy a local SIM card when I travel abroad, and save on roaming. Again unlocked, which means that I can switch providers if my T-Mobile stops being the best choice for this device. Plus I generally like Nokia products, they are very robust.Cons: Built-in maps have a very rudimentary interface, and no upgrade available. There is no problem with routing itself, but I didn't find any way to save my waypoints or select my waypoints from the contact list. That should be annoying if you have to use it more than once in a while. Built-in Skype doesn't allow video calls, even though there is a front camera just for these purposes. Lack of applications - personally for me it is not a big problem, I am too busy to worry about having games and specifically wanted just an Internet tablet. But for a person who needs to kill time playing games it might be a deal-breaker.Applications: funny, but even though there only 80+ available, so far I've found all I really needed, except good maps. Maybe I will need much more very soon - appetite comes as you eat - but so far this thing does all that I needed it to do. I can view documents, I can read email, I can browse internet. I can get weather on my desktop. I can get directions when I need them once in a while. I can call my relatives overseas for free via Skype-to-Skype calls. I can track my outdoor activities. I can take notes and make hand-writen notes to pdf files, almost as I would do while reading paper documents.Bottom line: all the cons that I see are on the software side, that is they should be fixable with a software upgrade or new applications.

I'm a heavy mobile phone user and i had fully tested and owned for several weeks the palm pre, the iphone 3gs, and the motorola droid and none of those mobiles are comparable to the nokia n900.now depending what you are looking for this is my recommendation:a) if you want free for life GPS turn by turn you should buy an android phone or a motorola droid, android phones have a cool user interface but is very limited and have a lot of constraints.b) if your thing is to download useful and a lot of junk apps you should buy an iphone. the multi touch in this phone is awesome, and the responsiveness of the screen is superb and the phone is very fast.c) if you want to have a nice user interface in your phone and have a slick design in your pocket you should buy the palm pre the web os is very nice and the responsiveness and speed is equal as the iphone.d) if you want to have the top notch web browser ever, want everything slick, multitasking, have full flash in your web pages and all the above mentioned you should buy  the n900. the speed, the storage capacity, the screen resolution, the physical keyboard is Fu..ing Great!, the screen is resistive and feels like you are touching a capacitive like the iphone, is absolutely awesome.also the 5 mega pixel camera is very cool, the contacts management is by far the greatest i ever seen in a device, you can manage to do anything with your contact AT THE SAME TIME, i mean, you can Google chat with him, Skype call, normal call, email him at the same time.so far 90% of the user interface works only in landscape mode, and for me is better that way, also that is why the palm pre have the biggest flaw, because only works in portrait mode except for the web browser.All the new top devices are switching from portrait to landscape, like the motorola droid, HTC, the latest Samsung and LG devices, the sonny Ericsson xperias and even the iphone had to switch for the keyboard landscape and lots of applications. portrait mode is in the pasts and only works well in contacts or dialing a number.The tv interaction with the n900 is gorgeous, you can search on youtube.com so can see what is like.so far for me this is the best device with huge potential and excellent web browsing experience i ever seen. it is way better than anything in the market right now.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "An oldie but a goodie!", "Author": "J.H.Niles", "ReviewID": "R2U8LZBAQSKWGK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone, but outdated now (otherwise it would have 5 stars).

Also is a mircoSD expansion slot that will take up to anther 16gigs  * Powerful Camera - 5.8 mega pixel camera with a full flash. It takes sharp pictures and video recordings  * Nokia Sponsored Community Repositories - FOSS applications written (or ported to Maemo) by the community are housed in an official \"extras\" repository. Installing additional applications from here is as easy as adding software to Ubuntu via the software center.  * TV Out - Provided with the phone are RCA cables to hook your N900 into a television/projector that hook into the headphone jack.  * Fantastic Browser - The N900 arguably provides the best mobile web browsing experience out there.  * USB-Micro Charging - The N900 charges via a standard USB micro connection, instead of some odd proprietary jack like many devices.  * Crystal Clear Screen - The 800x480 resolution is beautiful! Everything displayed on the device is crisp and clear.Cons:  * Battery Life - With heavy usage the N900 dies in about 6 hours. While this is still fairly good I've found I run the battery out almost every day from usage so I've taken to carrying a charging cord with me.  * Maemo Libraries - Maemo 5 is not compatible with most Debian Armel packages. This is because Maemo uses older library files for many (most notably libc6) packages. Updating said packages manually causes Maemo to stop working in most cases.  * Default Filesystem Setup - The default file system on the N900 is super non-standard and is my biggest complaint about the device. It contains a 256meg rootfs, 2gig ext2 /home, and 27gig fat32 storage. You can adjust these, but it is difficult to say the least and not something a new Linux user should attempt.  * Non-Standard Key Maps - Some of the key mappings on the N900 are not the same as a standard keyboard. As a result some Linux applications that are ported need to be remapped to work fully.  * Awkward Placement of Charging/Headphone Ports - It is awkward to hold/type on the device while either (or both) of these are plugged in.

For anyone who wants hassle free \"App store\" experience this is NOT the phone for you. On the other hand if you love to play with your phone and test it to see what its capabilities are this is a must have phone. For example in the past few days that i have owned this phone some of the really cool things i did was install irrecco a remote control app that controls practically anything that works on a IR remote, installed codecs for its default media player so that it plays most/all media formats that you can throw at it (i haven't tried but i am sure it WON'T play HD content), installed easy debian/openoffice a full office suite to edit word, excel and powerpoint, and lots of other stuff which you can only dream about on other phones. This is truly like a mini netbook that fits in your pocket besides being a good phone.However one important thing to point out is I have been using this phone just for a few days and I can't comment on its longevity. Also nokia has stated they won't update this phone from meamo to meego and whatever little niggles the current firmware has will possibly remain forever as it is remote that nokia will be releasing any update to the current pr1.2 (must admit though that this version is impressive nevertheless).

Battery life looks horrible, esp. if you keep WiFi turned on. Will update if it improves as it acures with usage.2. If you plug-in the head-set (provided), typing with your right hand becomes uncomfortable.3. The first row of keys on top should have had more space above. Limits your finger movement.4. There should have been a shift key on the right side too. May have to pause if you have to type upper case 'Q', 'Z' etc.But, inspite of all of the above, the N900 is still a great product.Plus, for me, the greatest puller is that the specs are open as is the OS.

Working & living in the middle east is a drag when it comes to using electronics to their optimum potential.  Yet, this is the best smartphone, phone, whatever.....I have had in the 8 years I've lived outside the U.S.  The nokia description, of this device being a small computer first, phone 2nd is spot on.  If you failed to read a statement similar to that, you may be disappointed in your first week of use.  My best friend has this phone and can't stand it.  Mainly because he can't navigate through it.  If you're a person who thinks black & white then you won't like this phone.  For people who can see grey, you'll be most satisfied.  I have had smartphones before.  The N95 which I lost and I currently have the N96.  I personally think the N95 is better than the 96.  However this review isn't for either one of those phones so let's talk about the real deal.  The N900, I don't know how much potential it has but I will be sticking with it to find out.  I took about a week to just navigate through this phone.  Yeah, a week to see what I could and couldn't do.  Camera is OK I suppose.  I honestly don't care about how great the camera is on any phone.  The pictures I've taken are pretty clear.  You can multi-task with this device which is great.  You want to reply to text messages while surfing the net, answer a call all within seconds then this phone is a keeper.  I wasn't familiar with the OS beforehand but I'm more than impressed.  The phone runs smooth.  You buy a $500 phone, you want it to run smoothly.  Remember, this is a small computer before it's an actual phone.  For anyone who can't understand that, stay away from this phone, stick with your iphone.  This phone doesn't have 2 thousand apps, not yet at least.  I didn't get my phone to play games on though.  I have an xbox & ps3 when I need my gaming fix.  I have a few friends with iphones and all I see them doing is playing games on it anyway.  That's great and all but actually trying to compare these 2 phones is like comparing apples & oranges.  If you want to just play games, make calls, and load your phone with apps, then this isn't the phone for you.  However if you want to have vast flexibility in the palms of your hands then you will do fine with this device.PROS:  Multi-tasks like no other.  Exterior construction is more durable than most other phones in my opinion.  Used without a hard cover for a good 2 weeks and doesn't have any scratches.  With all the things that you're able to do with this phone, it hasn't frozen up once.  An internet page fails to open every now & then but that happens with my MAC.  You can customize your 4 desktops with different photos or a main theme if you're into that.  Customize each desktop with the things you use the most, call directory, phonebook, google, media player, whatever.  Downloads other software/programs with ease.  Physical keyboard is more efficient than the virtual keyboard in my opinion.CONS:  I would love something as little as portrait mode to be used with more features other than the phone set-up.  Couldn't find a speed dial feature, maybe I'm retarded.  Receiving a call can be annoying when it keeps flip flopping between landscape & portrait mode.  An update would be greatly appreciated NOKIA. Phone is thick sure, heavy.....not so much.  Maybe heavy for 120lb weaklings.  You want a thin cute phone, get a motorola of some kind.  Battery life could be better just because it would be convenient.  If you're constantly using your WI-FI and bluetooth then battery life will be an even larger problem for you.  However, battery life is a constant problem for most smartphone users anyway from what I read.Hope this review helps anyone looking to buy a smartphone.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful device", "Author": "Carlos M \"Carlos M\"", "ReviewID": "R2CPQKBJJPW7HT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this device to replace a first generation iPhone. I have two cell phones (one for business and the other one for personal things) and I have had tried several brands and OSs. I was looking for something different from Windows Mobile (which I have on my personal HTC phone) that works the same way as your desktop Windows, it crashes and you don't know why but seems to be a common thing to reset the phone at least twice a month and menus are no longer user friendly on 6.5 version. So I was looking for Google's HTC or Nokia's N900 and I decided for this last one.This new Nokia is not only a cell phone, it's a mobile computer. The device comes with Nokia's new OS Maemo which is Linux based, so far more stable than windows mobile. I have been using my new cell phone 3 weeks from now and it runs without any issues. Maemo menus and settings are a lot more simple and user friendly than other Smart phones. If you're familiar to linux based OSs you'll find some useful things like extended desktops and the terminal. And as a real computer you can run more than one application at a time.When I bought it there wasn't too many reviews about it so there were some concerns about this smart phone and OS. Battery lasts for 2 or 3 days spending 1 hour call time and some 3G data transfer a day. If you use it all day long with the internet connection (Wi-Fi or 3G) and you're a call addict you'll need to recharge battery at the end of the day. Menus are user friendly as I mention before. Keyboard is easy to get used to it since is qwerty. I have big hands and fingers and was a little bit worried about pressing wrong keys on it, but no problem at all. It also comes with a stylus pen so you can use a virtual keyboard for data entry if you want to. Even if you live in a country where special characters like accents are used is a matter of time to get used to it but it comes with the cell phone. On this side you can also select a different languages without having to buy a new license for your OS. The OS has a built in VoIP and chat functionality  so you can easily setup your account and start talking or chatting with your friends immediately. Display is WGA (800 x 480 pixels) which is best resolution I have seen on mobile devices.I'm very happy so far for chosen the N900. There's only a couple of things I've experience as partial issues that I can live with and they are: sometimes at my office used to connect my cell phones to a USB computer port to save and charge battery. On the N900 you have to choose if you want to connect it as a store device or as PC Suite mode (where you can synchronize everything). When in PC suite mode I have experienced partial interference with my laptop mouse device which is connected to a USB port also (I assume driver conflict issues), doesn't happen on store device mode. The other issue I have notice on the N900, that I can't tell if it is a N900 or cell service provider issue is that it doesn't identify the caller ID on a specific voice private network service I have at my work cell service. When I receive a call from a regular cell phone or phone the caller ID works as it supposed to. I have contacted Nokia's local corporate service without response for this problem after 2 weeks. Hopefully this is going to get solved by the network service provider or Nokia in the next couple of weeks.There are some applications already developed for the device that you can download from Nokia's site, but since we're talking about a new OS, there are not many applications yet.

Yes, even things you couldn't find for iPhone (namely, OGG support and a programming environment).  Not to mention I didn't have to pay someone $99/year for the privilege of hacking my own hardware.  I waited to upgrade for an open phone, preferably one running Linux.  I found out about the OpenMoko, but it didn't have a hardware keyboard and wasn't very well polished.  I found out about Android, but it's almost as bad as iPhone with requiring you to only program in Java.  Then I heard about the N900.This thing is truly a fully fledged computer in the palm of your hand.  The first time I opened a terminal and started typing in commands I use every day, I was in love.  The fact that almost all the apps I use on my Treo already have equivalents on the N900 makes it a dream come true.  The UI is intuitive, smooth and beautiful.  My wife, the non-computer nerd, is drooling over this device.The N900 combines everything a computer should have: power, flexibility, polish and portability.  Even if this device didn't have all the openness about it, it would still be one of the best smartphones out there.Year of Linux on the desktop?

So I will not duplicate their efforts.The n900 is very quick, and in the month I have had it , has not shown any stalls or hang-ups at all.The browser is simply splendid, and it is clearly better than anything else on the market.  And for a device that is intended to access the Internet (I don't really make that many phone calls) having a first-rate browser is saying a great deal.  But the browser also forms the largest part of the user interface, and the UI is pretty mystifying.  The User Manual is almost pathetic in its inadequacy, so the user is reduced to experimentation to tease out the interactions.Here are other items I mostly like in the n900:* The GPS seems to be very sensitive, and it finds my location very quickly.  The maps are colorful and pleasant, but I do not plan to use the navigation system for turn-by-turn guidance so I am less critical than I might be.  But there are some annoying bugs that need correction.  For instance, when you are tracking a GPS route in your car and you stop at a red traffic light the map literally spins randomly around the spot where you stopped.  Very disconcerting!* The media player works well, but again that performance is skewered by the inadequate user instructions.  There is no guidance about how to import music from a previous player, so again one must experiment.  Also no hints at all with importing the album artwork with the music files.* The phone works very well and the audio quality is excellent.  Nokia did a very fine job designing the phone hardware and software.* The Internet Radio works fine too, but I have been unable to add any of my own favorite stations since the n900 tells me I have an issue with the Codec, and the user instructions offer no guidance.* I really like the integrated Contacts/e-mail/Messaging approach.* The camera seems to produce very nice pictures and the dual-LED flash does a good job of illumination.* Some little things.  I like the inclusion of the removable battery, and the lanyard attachment point, which is crucial to prevent drop damage.In summary, I could compress my reactions to the Nokia n900 into a few statements.  I mostly love it, except for a small number of easily-fixable bugs, and I think that the User Manual is useless.  If Nokia does not prepare a better manual (fast) they will be sadly limited to the geek market (like me) and the promise of this really excellent device will be unfulfilled.  But a good manual would broaden the appeal to a much larger base.", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "not an iphone killer because it's made as a mobile computer than a gimmicky phone...", "Author": "cloud", "ReviewID": "RYMXVEI0AWH1R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i got my device today and was very afraid to open it because of the nightmares i read here like dead pixels, mic problems, buggy, pitch black screen, etc.. fortunately, i haven't found any serious problems on my n900. the only issue i found is that it crashed for no apparent reason during the first hour of using it and it crashed again when i turned it on (charger plugged) after it ran out of power when things started to get sluggish and somewhat unresponsive. but after that, it's working smoothly now...after 4 years of not using a nokia phone (whatever series), it took me a while to learn again how things work w/ nokia's interface (looks and usage still feels symbian-ish even it's a different os). i grew up with only using nokia phones since the monochromatic screen days of 5110i till the cutesy 6230 so i can say that i'm kinda familiar with nokia phones. in my opinion, this isn't a device for everyone like the iphone. people may not like it as it's too complicated for their brains and just want to be spoon fed as easy as ABC. it's a computer for crying out loud and not a fashion gimmicky phone like what everybody is expecting for all devices to be. if the os and the processor is stronger than your brain, then this isn't for you...during the years that i haven't been using a nokia device, i had a love and hate relationship with windows mobile 5, 6, 6.1 and a very short time with android's g1. android back then is still an infant and although a stable os, i had the feeling that it's open source-ness isn't really open so i immediately backed off of using it further and i was right. windows 5 and 6 is great as it's like a windows pc version except it's mobile so using it isn't a problem. 6.1 is a nightmare that i don't want to narrate anymore...i must say too that i think a have a fetish with devices with hardware keyboards as my previous devices (htc wizard, kaiser, dream) all has it. it's weird because i don't really use it often and rely on just poking the screen and using the virtual keyboard as much as possible. maybe a subconscious taste for having that feature regardless if weight will be sacrificed...now, i'm using a new os for me as i have no background of using a linux in my entire life. this is my first time so i had doubts before pre ordering it. luckily, it passed my techie taste and hopes that it will have a good future and will be pushed to it's limit before maemo 6 comes out halfway or late next year to kill maemo 5 w/c the n900 is using...nokia is already great for making quality devices. the built is great, sturdy slide-out keyboard, location of things (lock, volume, stylus, usb slot, etc.) is tolerable although allocating it equally on all sides is much better rather than cramping too much beneath and the right side of the device in a portrait mode description. it also wouldn't hurt if they just placed the memory card slot at sim card slot at the back of the screen for easier accessibility like the htc kaiser...pros:* programs open really fast* screen is sharp and bright* virtual keyboard is very finger friendly* built is great* great os and very promising* built in microB browser and firefox beta 5 for maemo eats all those gimmicky browsers out there alive* 1700 mhz 3g (yehey for me!!! XD)* resistive screen is way better for this than capacitive. it gives more accurate inputs w/c is ideal for a computer (that's what nokia is labeling the n900)* not really that thick as some reviews say. it's a bit thinner than htc kaiser and possibly as equal as htc touch pro 2* not as heavy as htc kaisercons:* somewhat a half baked device (hopefully, ovi gives us more app especially fm tuner to activate the feature. maemo org. helps at some point but it's better if nokia supports it too like they do on symbian)* definitely needs a firmware upgrade to support some if not all programs in portrait mode* camera is so-so* a 3g device with a front camera but can't do video call as of now (i know t-mo doesn't have the video call service but european and asian networks that uses the 2100mhz 3g are supported as well as the video call service)* the device stand is really thin and flimsy. it's scary to think that it will break sooner or later* 3 row keyboard and small buttons (htc wizard and kaiser have 4 rows and way bigger buttons. if htc can do it, why can't nokia?)", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "It is really good in many things,except it keeps rebooting randomly many times.", "Author": "Amjad Eljammal", "ReviewID": "R2TXWFGGP66CQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really like it, everything is really good..except the phone I got it from Amazon.com was unopened item..and I was the first user but when i use the phone, it keeps rebooting randomly without a reason so I keep losing what i write and i have to rewrite, which I didn't install any software or did anything in a phone..and when i contacted Nokia costumer service, they asked me to return it.and it was so disappointed because they didn't try even to fix it.and i found online that I wasn't the only one who has this problem.and no one can find a solution for it.just most of them are waiting for update software..over all, I think i will return it because i can't stand it this problem.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "THE only TRUE LINUX phone for geeks...", "Author": "climb5462", "ReviewID": "R3LO3YIF4CCDYA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Where to begin...this phone is awesome!  I had a few issues right out of the box ( Just got it yesterday ), but both resolved over night after I let it fully charge and the following morning after redoing the tasks they were fine.I got a unit from the second batch and so far the second batch seems like Nokia fixed the kinks from the first one.  If you want a phone that does everything from SSH, DNS, Apache, to Xvid, Divx videos, then this phone is truly the King of phones.  I'm typing this review as we speak from my N900 via the Mozilla browser and I can tell you iPhone owners be scared...be very scared of this thing!The browser itself is getting updated at the end of Dec with the newest FULL ( Yes I said full ) Adobe Flash so it should be able to play sites like Hulu more smoothly ( although I didn't have a problem with watching standard videos via the browser on Hulu ) since the Flash that comes with the browser straight out of the box is the old 9.6 version.  Just having full Adobe Flash not that Flashpoint crap solidified my decision on pre-order and getting this device.Oh and today I setup a remote DNS with Apache on the phone and have already had two friends test it out and OMG, is it great--what other phone can do that?? NONE!To address the critics:You'll hear people say, oh well it doesn't have allot of apps so that's why it sucks, well neither did Apple or Android when they first came out.  It take's time when a new OS is released but their are already a bunch of apps that are available.  You'll also hear people say well Android multi tasks and it's also a Linux platform...the only thing Linux about Android is the Kernel and Android is not an open platform, whereas Maemo is almost full Linux but in the mobile version and you have full access to all coding within Maemo and customization as much as you want unlike Google or Apple who go after people who customize the OS.MMS as well as full portrait mode control ( portrait is already available but you have to do a little trick with opening and closing programs while you have the phone in portrait ) is coming in the Dec update.  This is one of the main thing's critics use to dissuade potential N900 buyers.Yes it has a resistive touchscreen but you don't notice it, the responsiveness of the screen is comparable to that of the iPhone of any Android touch screen capacitive device ( Yes I had an iPhone so I know the screen ).  Resistive is also great for selecting small objects ( Ever try selecting something small on the iPhone it's a pain ) with the stylus or using the handwriting program so you can actually write notes on the screen ( can't do that with iPhone or Android ) with your own handwriting.Physical keyboard is small but you don't feel squished when needing to use it to type ( virtual keyboard can also be used via the screen ).Turn by turn, voice navigation is coming via Sygic in about a week so no more \"Oh the phone doesn't have voice navigation\" crap.Everything Else:The processor itself is capable of 1GHZ ( so technically just as fast as the snapdragon ) but is capped at 680MHZ to preserve battery and reduce heat, but the processor itself with 1GB of ram means this baby is fast and damn do I mean fast!I bought a Class 6 16GB micro sdhc a while back so I bumped the storage in this thing to 48 GB ( ofc not 48GB total because of OS storage just like any other smartphone ) more than any iPhone or Android user...  :PThis is THE phone for geeks and nerds and the only phone that's Linux, open, and in all actuality a computer first, phone second but it's also a phone that will appeal to the normal user because of it's accessibility and user friendly interface.What other phone can run full HTML Google Voice and Wave via the browser and not having any slow issues...nothing, except the N900!  Oh and iPhone people, you can actually switch out the battery on this thing, which means extra power.People pay more for the iPhone and they get way less, and people will actually defend Apple's decision for basically making a dumbed down phone, whereas Nokia you get everything that is expected in a phone and the newest and best technology to back it up.  Having everything in a phone is what people want--a great 5 mp camera, dual led flash, camcorder, front camera for video calling, massive storage, full Adobe Flash, full Mozilla browser, massive storage for music and video...This phone after the Dec update when we get portrait and MMS will be THE iPhone killer and seriously ahead of Android on all fronts.New owners should join us at [...] where we have forums to discuss everything Maemo, and if you have issues or questions just go there as everyone is great and we are more than willing to help any person out with N900 questions or issues.Tips and Tricks for the N900:[...]Improving Battery Life:[...]^^ Using that I have so far been using the phone ( After all day recharging yesterday ) with internet radio and browsing usage as well as GPS and email for close to eight hours already and my battery still show's full.

Decent camera, great multimedia capabilities and a great keyboard (man, I miss that).This thing was with me for about 3.5 years until it got stolen on a backpacking trip to Vietnam.

If you know what you want to do with it then there's almost no other smartphone that lets you do as many things as the N900. This is especially true if you can make use of the fact that the N900 is almost a Linux machine with full network and phone capacity. Here are some tips for using it:1.The Amazon price has climbed up quite a bit. If you happen to travel to Hong Kong, I think you can still get one there for something like $200. They are also available at the same price on taobao, but few sellers there ship internationally.The Hong Kong version is identical to the US version except it has the FM transmitter disabled (you can use the GPS in US). You can reenable it by installing a hack but the signal is very weak, not usable. Fm transmitter isn't really useful for me anyway.At $200 this thing is pretty much a steal. Comparable to the HP touchpad on firesale.2.Use the custom kernel and underclock if not overclock your CPU. Also, install wifi switch, bluetooth switch and autodisconnect. The N900 can last much longer.3.Buy backup batteries and battery chargers. They are very cheap.4.Install opera mobile. It's more usable than MicroB and faster with preloading.5.Xchat is a little unstable for me, but Irssi works perfectly.

It comes with a shell built in.+ Multi-tasking is smooth and integrated. You won't find a better multi-tasking phone.+ Built-in support for video chat.+ Built-in support for several video formats.- Keyboard only has 3 rows, seems small.- Price.+ FM Transmitter (yes, you read it right, transmitter).+ Qt development.+ Component Cable Output.This phone is more like a science project than a polished finished product.

That device was ahead of its time in 2002, and the N900 is the same way.I have said a lot about my experiences with it in my ongoing review on the community forum for Maemo, the operating system that runs on the N900. Feel free to check it out [...] (Flandry's ongoing N900 review: perspective of a PDA poweruser). I gave the N900 less than five stars here because Nokia made some poor design decisions and are failing in some ways to keep up their end of the deal (it's not so much that it is bad but that it could have been better--GPS functionality is the main exception as something that, as of right now, is actually BAD); I gave the N900 more than three stars because the community and the potential are the best out there. It all sounds trite, I know. Read my extended review on[...]if you want a more in depth perspective.Edit: July 2010I still love my N900 and have phased out the C860 completely. The community at maemo.org has really made the experience exceptional. Today I installed an amazing LCARS theme (UI like in Star Trek starships) created for free, and a great new application manager was released by another community member recently.

Not having the phone in portrait mode has not been to much of  a problem for me as i usually hold my phone in landscape mode anyway. I never had an Iphone b4 but iv'e been able to play around with one. The interface just wasen't for me and the fact that its very restrictive. I bought this phone comming from an HTC Tilt, which i was very pleased with and used for over a year. I wanted a phone with better internet capabilities than the HTC tilt and the n900 delivered. Its very easy for me to navigate through to different webpages and do many things at one time which is great. The double tap feature is good and i also really like the circular zoom as i find my self using that alot when there are small boxes to check or links to press. Its easy to dl media pics progs using the n900, functions much like a computer. I also dont consider myself a geek and i dnt know anything about programming. Surprisingly ive found my self using my computer alot less often since i've had the n900 going on face book and checking statuses is cake along with being able to check my messages and hotmail email acount. There are some downsides to the messaging and phone apps but its very minimal and when the new maemo versions come out im sure will be fixed. As for the apps ive been able to dl a bunch of basic apps which is all i really need. I got a couple basic games, emulators, weather, news. Its a little dissapointing there is no program to buy music but i can just dl my music form my computer. The touch screen is great very responsive you do need to add a little presure but it's not to bad. Overall i am impressed with the device as ive used it i seee Huge potential. It does function as is and does what its suppose to do. It never crashed yet and has always preformed quickly and easily. I thought it would be difficult to set up widegets and desktops (of which there are 4) but it was easy and I was able to dl wallpapers and position everything the way i wanted. ive used the camera at night in my room it didnt take to bad of a picture with minimal lighting, but takes great pictures with suficient light. I also love that the camera has a slide lense because i had broken the lense on my tilt. O another thing i was able to stream radio broadcats of my favorite shows easily using edge network 2.5 from att. If you have good att service in your area i would recommend getting the phone. The flash isnt as quick but webpages load very fast probably faster or equal to how long it took on my htc tilt 3g.

Instead of a long winded review here is my short take on itIt is visually gorgeous. Finally a color scheme and animations that outdoes the iphone in my opinion. (I have used an iphone for a year)It is extremely powerful, and multitasking, and transitions are top notch. Its really that good.I have used an iphone and G1 over the past 18 months- both with capacitive screens. I can assure you that the responsiveness of the resistive screen on this phone is quite comparable. Its nothing like the horrible resistive screens on the n97 and 5530 nokia phones. The touch sensitivity has not been an issue for me at all.The keyboard is quite useable. I am currently deciding between this and the blackberry bold 9700 that I got as an upgrade from tmobile, and the keyboard would not be the dealbreaker.So what really makes me angry about this phone will i stare at its gorgeous screen?Its the antiquated phone and email apps.EMAILS:  Its frustrating how Exchange 2003 is not supported. It is also frustrating how you have to go through multiple clicks to read emails.This is what I found extremely weird: Suppose you were last checking your hotmail account and then decided to do some browsing. Now, while you are browsing, you get a notification that there is a new email in your gmail account. you tap on the  notification icon. Guess where it takes you- to your hotmail account (since that was where you left your email program last)!!!!! After that you have to navigate back back back to the main email interface and then tap on the gmail account and then on the inbox and then on the new email....!!!Another quirky feature- suppose you have only account setup under Nokia messaging services. Well, you first need to click on email, then on Nokia messaging, then on that one account and then you will finally be able to access the folders of that account. PHONES: There is no quickdial option for making phone calls (you can create icons on the home screen for individual contacts but unlike an android phone you cant create an icon for a specific number associated with a specific contact- i.e. you cannot have quickdial icons.) Unlike the iphone you also cannot have default phone numbers associated with a contact.Finally the battery life is horrible. I keep the phone on Edge, no wifi, bluetooth and GPS turned off as well. Brightness turned down to 3 out of 5. And i still cant get through 8 hours of basic browsing and calling. On the Blackberry bold, I am perpetually on 3G or Wifi and I do the same amount of calling and browsing , and the battery does not get over in 2 days.So why have i not dumped the phone yet- potential.You see the email and the phone issues are software issues that can be solved with a software update.Final closing thoughts- Most smartphones out there have hardwares that cant keep up with software demands. Well this is probably the only phone that is the opposite. The hardware clearly is more than equipped to handle the current state of software.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Real web browser in your pocket", "Author": "The Captain", "ReviewID": "R24HH6GYSSK8SK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The N900 is not a particularly great phone. Hardware-wise its critical limitations are the lack of a USB host port, weak GPS chipset, and no multi-touch. I know reviewers have dragged on and on about the \"lack\" of a capacitive screen, but they are wrong. There are resistive screen technologies that do implement multi-touch. The resistive touch screen on the N900 allows me and another person to play a game of chess using a coffee stirrer straw-as-stylus - not possible to do on a capacitive screen! Software-wise the Maemo OS has at least the absolute minimum to make this hardware usable. Sadly enough, the forward facing webcam has an incomplete Maemo OS driver which results in a grainy off balance image. The one fact of using the device I did not find immediately obvious was tapping the upper right corner to close the current context... any visual cue of this necessity is blurred by a screen effect. Otherwise there is a lot of potential (and actual probable updates to come) for the software to catch up with the market-leading hardware. Very impressive is the stock integration of Skype, SMS, and IM messaging. Conversations are threaded based on your phone's address book of contacts. What other phone does that?

If you have average computer literacy, then you'll do fine with this device.PROS:-Real multitasking, like 10 windows open at once if you want.-Fast performance.-Beautiful, slick, responsive GUI.-Stable OS.-32 GB built in. Can function as a hard disk when you plug it into a computer. I've store pretty much all my documents and presentations and can view them on the go. Also you have an 1.5 hours of high quality video recording capacity.-Beautiful, sharp screen.-Excellent QWERTY keyboard. Beats the pants off any on-screen keyboard.-Build. Feels like a professional device, not a consumer phone.-NO CONTRACT. If you have wi-fi at work and home then who needs the data/slavery plan? The up-front costs are more substantial for the n900 but you make it up by not enslaving yourself to an expensive contract.-Limited apps. Few good quality apps. No endless lists of stupid time-wasters like on the iphone.-Skype built in. Save money on calls also.-Stylus.CONS:-Battery. You need to charge the phone nightly. Not a biggie for me but it might be for you if you need to use to use it for several days in a row.-Size. There are smaller phones out there, but it's not huge or anything.-Camera (stills). Ultimately it's a cell phone camera. But if you're into photos then don't by a cell phone for it.If you do get the phone and want a data plan then you will have to go with T-Mo. Supposedly the 3G doesn't work with ATT. IPhone looks like a kid toy in comparison. Blackberries look like MS-DOS compared to Mac OSX compared to this thing. Compared to droid I think this has the better OS but android has more apps. If you want something different from the crowds and value your independence from US carrier shenanigans, then this phone is badass.----After a couple of weeks with the phone I would like add the following:This phone is badass. I have open office installed. I have google chrome installed--on my cellphone. I have an SNES and sega genesis emulators allowing for thousands of different games. It's like a little linux PC. In fact, debian linux runs on it like it would on a desktop/laptop. No other phone comes close. The 32 GB and built-in FM transmitter are quite awesome in their own right, as is the built-in seamless Skype support.You should probably learn a little bit of command line linux to unlock the full potential of this phone. I'm no linux buff. There's a great tutorial at [...] that's heavy on star trek and other nerd references--it's a little embarrassing. The language is very similar to command line MS-DOS but you will need to learn a new set of commands. However gaining access to the basic file directory gives you huge advantages and flexibility that you just cannot get on other phones. Again, you will need to possess moderate computer literacy to fully appreciate this device. Ultimately, you will be in control and not Apple or ATT or VZW or whatever.-----After a few months I would like to make a complete about-face. This phone is a nightmare. You put all this effort into it but nothing seems to work right. Okay so you can do all this geeky crap that you will never use, like install open office or game emulators. After a while, you realize that you're never going to use office on your phone, that you spent hours tinkering with it in the process, and that your battery is dead because intensive use of this device will literally drain the battery in 1-2 hours. AND YOU CAN'T SEND MMS for crying out loud. Microsoft exchange would work one day and stop another time. Sometimes it would work if a rebooted the phone. I felt like I was working with a Windows 95 PC! And Nokia has left this device for dead. You can't sync it with your PC or Mac because the nokia sync software looks like it was written by a 5 year old--really, it's almost a joke except that it's for real. Meego will never materialize.

It turned out that the metal part of the micro-USB receptacle had come apart in the seam, and eventually came off of the circuit board completely.  I wound up taking it apart to see if I could re-solder, but one side was obstructed by chipset/housing.  No part of the casing or phone's internals to help support the USB port and its only held in by (4) very small soldering points and (2) slightly larger \"epoxy?\" points. Phone being RMA'd (luckily) by vendor.  This after 2 years of no issues with microUSB, and bulky miniUSB-to-microUSB adapter, on my Moto Q.That said, I like this phone for many of the reasons already stated.  One other feature which may not have been mentioned, is that you can dial back the power consumption of the WiFi radio.  I just came from the \"DROID\" and posted my thoughts here:[...]As mentioned, the calendar was limited in options for setting up \"recurring events\" however I was able to sync my Outlook calendar from my PC, which manages my Comcast POP3 account, via the Nokia PC sync software.  Phone seemed really stable, but again, not very many apps available to mess it up (a la the DROID).  I'm not sure why someone said there are no \"Notifications\", there are multi-colored LEDs and \"pop-ups\" for the respective notifications...though it would be nice to have something persistent in the \"status\" bar by the \"clock\".Having \"highlight-to-copy-and-paste\" is really easy (just press and hold), along with a mouse pointer, are great features.  Its also great to have Flash support, and I though I'd finally be able to listen to XM Radio via my online account.  While the web pages render quickly and properly, the media player itself is not compatible, and the only thing which does not render properly.  I'm not sure if there is a workaround for that, and wonder if it will be a recurring issue on other sites.  I just wish there was a search app comparable to that of Windows' \"Live Search\"...didn't have time to search for alternatives, or if \"Live Search\" would run on 900.Overall, having the N900 feels like having a Ferrari F430 Competition, but they only installed 1st gear.  \"For me\", all the basics are handled, and handled fairly well, but given the lack of apps (specifically Sling or Hava Player, and LED flashlight) and my inability go get Vonage account working with the native SIP client, I'm in the waiting game like many others.  Outside of that, I just wish call volume were at least 50% higher for both earpiece and speaker.  My Moto Q is much higher in both respects  vs. the 900.  Although my fellow co-worker, also a VoIP engineer, stated that Nokia has native noice cancelling which raises volume on an \"as needed basis\", to compensate for surroundings.  I also thought the resistive screen would be a deal breaker, but again, compared to the DROID, its much more accurate, and more forgiving in that it doesn't open what's not intended.

Applications- Some applications in Maemo Store (not too many right now but I guess it will increase) are nice..Like the OM Weather. Uses GPS to determine the location.7. Keypad is OK.8.

However, I do have problem with my car Hand Free Link System. My Lexus ES350 and SE W810i used to work great together  everytime while I'm driving. The SE W810i is automatically drop my Jawbone2 bluetooth and connect with my car's bluetooth system automatically. Now with the N900, I have to reconnect it everytime.Update: I have to turn off the Jawbone2 bluetooth in order for the N900 to connect automatically with my car Hand Free Link system. Problem solve.CAMERA:  During the day, picture look good, color is accurate but the \"pin hole\" lens  is no where close to my 7yrs old Canon G2 (4MP). I would not depend this camera for my vacation trip, but rather for emergency cases where camera is always there when needed. The flash is nice to have when shooting a close up object in the dark, but don't count on it when take a group of people. About video: I haven't try video yet.LAYOUT DESIGN:  This is my strongest point of interest. The N900 looks... REALLY SEXY! It is not as thick like I though. Beside, I would carry it on my belt so thickness won't be an issue to me. I like the Horizontal design with the option of Portrait when making a phone call. This Horizon design will make the N900 toward more of computer style than cellphone itself.  The NO button(s) on the face make the screen look smoother and cleaner, plus the physical slice out keyboard...  Two thumbs up!TOUCHSCREEN: I know some of you prefer Capacitive touchscreen because of its accurate and a smooth  \"scroll up/down\" with your finger sweep. Well, you won't miss it with N900 Resistive screen. The bonus is you can do it with your glove on. Multi-touch? I really don't miss it much. For enlarging or reducing function, the \"finger rotary\" effect  work great each time, and I couldn't ask for more.INTERNET:  As many other reviews have said, I'm not going to repeat it.QUALITY BUILT:  I don't know some review complain about cheap made and plasticky look but to me, it's an excellent quality buit to me,  just  open the slice out keyboard halfway and twist the LCD screen lightly, then do it the same on the Adroid phone... you will know what I mean.This phone is exceed my expectation, worth of waiting.

There are 4 desktops (yes, multi-tasking at it's best!) and you can add contacts, favorites, shortcuts and apps on these to access whenever you need.Also, you can keep the apps you access open, no need to close one to get to another. This is really handy when you are on the phone and you have to browse the web for some information. So far I have kept 12 apps open at the same time (all heavy hitters like IM, Phone, You tube, Maps) with no significant hit to the performance...ohh this is just like surfing my own desktop :)3 G speed is fast (I use T-Mobile by the way). You could change to wifi when in proximity.There are different calling options- like Skype and GTALK so that means you can save some $$$ on the phone minutes if you don't have one of those unlimited minute plans. Actually, when you call or receive a call the phone gives you an option to select the type of call you want it to be (VOIP or network)Another neat feature is the FM transmitter- I hook it up with my car stereo to listen to media--no more auxiliary cables needed!You could watch the your tube videos on your big screen TV with the AV out cablesFor enthusiasts out there, X-Terminal is inbuilt :) I just turned this phone into remote system administration tool!Finally, no phone can be perfect- there are very obvious bugs that I hope will be fixed via updates soon-phone is on the chubby side, almost 200 grams--but that is the cost of having a 5MP camera, dual flashes, IR PORT-- however this is the best thing out there is you want the functions of a phone and a internet computer rolled into one device--but don't buy this if you are looking at some thing like an Iphone. There is simply no comparison. As I see it, Iphone means restrictions, and being limited in what you can do (believe me I owned one for a month), whereas an N900 is freedom to do what you want. The initial price is heavy, but it will save you money in the long term as there are no long term contacts to be tied down to. It is open source, and you have the root access to play around.One more thing- I was very dissapointed with the Amazon.com customer service.

The problem is that I based my purchase on what it said in the \"Technical details\" section. Quoting:What's in the Box: handset, battery, travel charger, stereo headset (WH-205), video out cable (CA-75U), cleaning cloth, operating instructionsThe package I got was insted a no-frills package: charger, handset, and battery. That's it. No trace of the USB cable, TV out cable, headphones, etc. Worse, the battery was not a genuine Nokia BL-5J and that fact showed in the extremely poor battery life. The package came with a manual that was for a nondescript Nokia featurephone. The whole package, in fact, was so cheap that I thought the phone was a counterfeit. Thankfully it was legitimate.Later I saw Thriftycomputer's website and I saw the same item. This time it had an accurate description of what was included.

You don't have to link up to your laptop with bluetooth, rather you can do it with wifi.  And (here's the best part) because ATT's unlimited data plan (because their system does not recognize this as a smart phone) you can surf with your laptop using the ATT network 2.5G (or whatever preceded 3g).  All the other carriers wanted somewhere from 20 to 80 bucks monthly for data ranging from 1 gig to 9 gigs.  With this device and ATTs unlimited data plan (for non smart phones like this one) you get unlimited wifi to your devices for 15 bucks a month once you install the joikuspot premium app (that will cost you 9 euros I believe - well worth it).  I seem to max out at around 300k rates though, but I'm just reading the web mostly and that is fine with me.  It's not 4g, it's not even 3g, but who cares at this price?  I'm connected to the net in between the home and a standard wifi spot....for 15 bucks a month!Solid linux machine with phone capabilities.  Using the debian lenny release, many standard full linux apps will run on this machine (gnome, kde, lxde is probably the best windows manager here but more awkward than the maemo apps due to resource demands - N900 only runs at 600 mhz).  Best part of this phone is that ATT doesn't recognize it as a smartphone and therefore it qualifies for ATT's dataplan for non-smart phones which costs 15 bucks a month with unlimited gsm (2.5g?) data and just a month to month contract.Linking the N900 with my lenovo 410s laptop running linux mint via bluetooth, I was able to surf the web this weekend while riding in the passenger's seat of a car making a 250 mile trip.  While the speeds seem to be at dialup capability, the fact that I have internet and didn't have to pay for the 60 dollar a month 4 GB capped data plans for a laptop was great.  Lacks the sparkle of the newest smartphones, but it fits my needs perfectly.  FWIW you do not need a sim chip to operate this device - something I've noticed you must have to operate a smartphone.  Of course, when you put the sim chip in you expand your data capabilities beyond wifi.  This should be viewed as a pocket linux machine with phone and unlimited data hotspot capabilities.Update May 11 2011:  I find it incredible that the price of this phone has risen from $348.00 when I bought it on April 11 to $499.00 today.  I attribute that to it's open source software that is much more attractive in view of the recent \"Iphone, WP7, android tracks you,\" stories of the last few days.

I know it's not just about this phone, but still it's annoying being unable to use 3g internet for more than 1 hour because then you run out of charge for the whole day.Second thing, some choices in the design of the case are disputable, the screen's on/off switch is on the bottom of the phone implying the use of two hands to activate/deactivate it, which is quite annoying. It can be mediated by setting the on/off button properly, but it' s not the best option.Another problem is the position of the usb(or whatever it is) port: when you have to write something, you constantly have the wire in between of your left hand's fingers, which is annoying again.Also the screen is not the best one on the market and while it's decent, iPhone's or HTC HD2 are on a higher level.Last thing, the interface: although the phone has a builtin gyroscope, it' s never used except for the gallery application. As result, this phone can be properly used only on its widescreen orientation, which is great for texting and instant messaging, but it sucks hard when you' ve got to look for a contact and call him.My final consideration is that this phone is worth buying if you're not an \"intensive caller\", because after a while it' ll drive you a bit mad with its horizontal configuration(the only moment in which the interface is vertical is when you close it right before the phone call).It doesn' t have only cons though: the interface is original and very nice to see and use, you just have to take some time to get used to it.The keyboard is probably my favourite part, it' s freaking comfortable, way better than on-screen ones, it made me almost forget I was not using a laptop to chat.The other nice thing is the operating system: you' ve got a full-featured linux distribution running on it, therefore you've got access to some of the most well-known software: firefox, xchat, pidgin and so on; the default browser is by far the best one I've ever tried on a mobile device(also thanks to the keyboard).An impression I had is that sometimes the whole system suffers a bit because of the cpu speed, which should be ~600mhz, but it's acceptable, the only thing is that it's not as fluid as an iphone.To sum up everything, I think this is a good phone for a geek(also because of nice QT development environment), but I wouldn't recommend it to the average user.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buy if you are a computer programmer and/or enjoy being frustrated", "Author": "Jeff Cheap", "ReviewID": "RWWA8IGWLXVZ2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have waited a couple of months to write this review because I have never had a \"smartphone\" before (although with all of my trouble I am not sure that this is any type of \"smartphone\" at all) and I wanted to be sure that the phone was going to work and that any problems were not just because I did not know how to use the phone. It seemed to work ok at first although almost every photo taken with the flash looked overexposed for some reason. Then about a month ago the problems started, and it has been non-stop frustration and regret for buying this thing since then.Suddenly, whenever I would receive a text message, the notification light would come on and the \"message received\" tone would sound, but whenever I tried to check the message, it was nowhere to be found. People were sending me text messages but they would just disappear (the messages, not the people). At first I could still send messages but within a couple of days, that would no longer work either. Then I could no longer sign into Skype, although my user name and password for Skype still worked fine on my desktop and laptop.Since I could no longer use 2 of the most important functions on my phone, I emailed Nokia with my problems. I received the auto-reply saying that they had received my email but it took more than one week for them to respond and when they did, they just called me on my cell phone number. By that time I had given up on them and gone to the Nokia support forum, where I found some help (none of it supplied by Nokia but rather some helpful posters), although it was a bit difficult to follow as it involved opening an \"X Terminal\" on the phone and inputting some computer programming language.Just when I thought I had it all working again, it went back to no longer receiving messages, or being able to receive messages, or to being able to sign into Skype, so the very nice guy that was trying to help me on the forum recommended (not an employee of Nokia, by the way) that I \"reflash\" the device, which is basically like doing a complete Windows re-install on your computer. I also contacted Nokia again through their customer support, but it has been almost 2 weeks and all that I have received from them was the initial auto-reply letting me know that they had received my email: \"Thank you for contacting Nokia Care Contact Center. Your inquiry is very important to us, and one of our product specialists will be responding to you shortly. Nokia has a commitment to customer service, and we strive to respond to inquiries within 24-48 hours.\" Thanks for nothing but the meaningless words, Nokia.I had to again input computer programming language on the \"X Terminal\" of the phone and had to try several different methods that I found on different sections of the Nokia support forum (none of them offered up by Nokia itself, by the way) before finally getting it to work again. It has only been one day but it seems to be working fine now, but many times and for a few weeks I was ready to send this phone back to Nokia since they seem unwilling to help no matter how many times I have contacted them. I have spent several hours trying to get this \"smartphone\" to work properly - I didn't spend almost $500 on a mobile computer/phone just so that I could learn computer programming skills to keep it working properly. Furthermore, it has been 3 months since I sent in the $50 rebate form to Nokia and I still have not received it! Buy this \"smartphone\" only if you enjoy trying to figure out the proper computer programming to get it to work again, or if you would like to spend $500 on a paperweight. Try checking out the posts on Nokia's support forum if you think that I have exaggerated my problems - there are hundreds if not thousands of posts complaining of problems with the N900.Pros: Nice-looking phone, camera takes good pictures at times (but not with the flash), Skype-enabled (when it works), no problems accessing Wi-Fi (other than signing into Skype)Cons: Phone is heavy, short battery life, software has far too many problems, no help at all from Nokia, flash pictures look terrible, contacts too hard to edit (it seems to not be possible to change a contact's phone numbers without creating an entirely new contact, but I'll have to check this on the forum. It's certainly not easy to do in any case), does not keep songs in their folders but scatters them around, making it difficult to playback particular songs/cdsBottom line: I wish that I had waited and bought an Android or Google phone instead.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's a good phone, but did not make me \"very\" happy", "Author": "Alex V. \"Alex\"", "ReviewID": "RH5UR1TQS1RT0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok, so many detailed and well writen reviews are here so what I'm going to do is tell you my personal experience with this phone that I've been using for a month and a half now.When I first got the phone, I had a very HARD time with it restarting by itself when using the Internet or when using more than 2 applications at a time.  Within a Nokia forum I found out that it was because of the firmware that the phone came with (not totally tested I guess) and that was why I almost threw it to the wall more than one time, as I was sick of having a brand new phone that restarted itself every time I used it.Thanks to that forum, I found a way to go around and manually fix the problem and it was really solved.  Then came the firmware update and finally the phone was working fine using Nokia factory configurations (not a manual fix).About the good stuff on this phone: it was made to work as a little computer on your hands, which is great since it has several applications (not so many) to work with and customize it.  The Internet browsing it IS like you were seating on your on PC/laptop, if you go to youtube, or facebook or amazon, etc, you will not enter the \"mobile\" sites but to the actual site.When making a call, I've had several volume issues, I've took the volume to the limit and if I'm in a noisy environment, I have a hard time hearing the other person.  Even worse is the speaker phone, I really don't know why, since the stereo speakers sound great if you play music or videos, but not when using it for a call (lack of volume).The video quality is amazing, I actually connected my phone to my LCD TV and watched a couple of widescreen movies.  The music player is nice too, I haven't used playlists but the phone itself categorize the music by 4 categories that are very useful, most of all the \"never played\" category.The keyboard, well, it is nice, but as many others had said, you have to get used to the space bar on the right side, not in the middle.  The keyboard also may get slided accidentally when handling the phone to take a photo.  About the camera, it works pretty cool to, it has several settings that are useful.  I can't comment more on this since I did not buy the phone because of the camera, I don't really \"use\" it like some others.  In addtion, I haven't found out how to copy and paste when browsing, since you cannot use the pencil to \"select\" text then copy and paste it elsewhere.About disk space, touchscreen usage and resolution, this is where this phone starts to be a competition to the iphone and so many other phones.  32GB is enough space to put my favorite music and movies, I can't say applications since there aren't so many apps for maemo yet.  The touchscreen is beautiful, the 4 different workspaces make the phone very interesting, since you may customize one for business, one for fun/media, one for internet related stuff and another one for whatever you may like.Personally, I like to have custom ringtones for several contacts, but Im still unable to do this with this phone... :(Now, even that the phone is beautiful, fast and very useful, what I still don't like is the size, weight and grip of it.  Don't take me wrong, I was not expecting a lightweight phone with all the features it has, BUT, this is way to heavy and bulky for me and that is one more reason for me to rate it 3 stars (IT IS OK).", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Superb Phone!

Scott", "ReviewID": "R1LSQB8TCS1Y5O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the phone after reading many comments on it. As an IT person i wanted something more than a normal phone that will allow me to custom install programs onto the phone. Due to this phone being open to allow you to install different operating software in addition to third party software above what the blackberry gives, it was a clear decision.The phone has operated very well in the role, i wanted it for more than a year, although i needed to hard flash the phone twice due to installing software that still needed testing, (my fault, but i was prepared for it).The ability to do skype calling and messaging seamlessly is a big plus as to all the other programs one can install. Battery life is ok for such a big phone, although Nokia could have used a more powerful battery.My big complained about the phone is the standard e-mail program that comes with the phone. Reason for a 4 and not 5 star rating. Yes you can install third party e-mail programs such as claw's mail (that is not that brilliant anyway), however my previous 900 series phone had an awesome e-mail program, so what went wrong?The big problem with the e-mail program is the need to be constantly connected to the internet. Even when you downloaded an e-mail, when you want to open and read it, the phone will go into rechecking the mail, and you sometimes have to wait before an e-mail message will open, that even after you have viewed the message already. If you are not connected to the internet the phone will at times not displays the e-mail message, saying it needs to be downloaded first, even when you viewed it before. There seems also to be no pattern to it, as messages not viewed before and messaged viewed in the past will at random either open or fail, giving you the message that the mail needs to be opened. If you relay on your e-mail when offline from the grid, i would not recommend this phone as i do not recommend the claws mail third party program.That said, unless you are a power used with technical skills, i would not recommend this phone, rather get the N8 or a blackberry.

Great camera with high resolution and good colour.  The slideout keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the backlight illumination in low light is a great touch.Nokia working with the open source community has created a great software platform for the N900, Maemo5.  The UI is intuitive and fun to use.  The multiview makes multitasking on the N900 simple and fun.  This is the first cell, where you can fully experience the same web browsing you'd expect on a desktop or laptop.  The software is not sluggish unlike on current Android devices.

To my greatsurprise, I have discovered it was super easy to use - kind of iPhone with keyboard,but with many additional, very attractive hardware features:  - 5 MP camera that makes great photos and high resolution videos (HD) and has dual-diode flash, this alone being a major feature to embarass iPhone crowd.  - FM transmitter that allows you to listen any music, internet radio etc. in the car (as most cars are not bluetooth ready); it ofcourse supports bluetooth as well  - very nice integration of e-mail, IM, SMS, Skype, Google talk, all built-in and integrated - how cool is was to actually place a Google talk VOIP call to a friend with N900 and gmail account!  - did I mention beautiful slide out keyboard, with the best little keys, that even people who made IBM laptops would be proud of?  - very high resolution screen - this is something very distinguishing, as it allows reading many web pages as is, if your vision is reasonably ok or corrected with glasses  - and then, if you like, to there is two options to zoom -in - a dedicated zoom in/out button (that works great, super-fast) or a simple screen - tap that either zooms-in, or even better, discovers text or image boundaries and expands them to the screen width  - GPS works fast, at the same or similar speed as iPhone. Typically, I measured it to lock in under 10 seconds.  - very fast internet connectivity -- unlike HTC Fuze that I used previously, the connectivity speed is network dependent and not device dependent. That said, kudos to T-Mobile who delivers 2-3x the bandwidth of AT&T; (in South San Jose at least) at 30% less total cost.  - built-in media player (and many other apps you can download) support uPnP - this means that your phone at home network can access media servers and play music, videos etc.  - the applications manager allows super-easy ways to download apps from Nokia repository, Maemo repository, and also Maemo-devel and testing if you wantto participate in testing new apps. There are no limitations like the onesimposed by Apple iPhone - anything goes!

Repeating events are non-functional. There's no way to set up a repeating meeting on the 4th Saturday of every month for example.

Currently I disable 3g on the phone so save myself battery, but the receptions seems to work just fine. But it turn it on once in a while if I feel i don't have enough reception bars at a certain location which usually boosts it to max btw. You can use Nokia's proprietary Ovi to transfer your contacts from an old Nokia or do it manually. There also a wonderful app called Hermes (not sure if i spelled that correctly) that pulls your contact's information from twitter and facebook and it fills in information such as phone number, email, birthday, and their profile pictures, it's so nice to know that it's so easy to personalize your phone. =)EMAIL: It has support for main e-mail clients such as yahoo, gmail, hotmail, aim, and mail for exchange (Note: althought it has support for yahoo email, I couldn't register my account for whatever reason, but it wasn't too difficult to register it manually). I like Nokia messaging the best however, because it provides a free push email service and also because it caches all your email into the phone so you can view it offline. The Email is very well integrated with your contacts so you can simply select your contact. I haven't tried to sync this phone with google calendar, but it hear it's seamless. The whole Email experience is a pleasure to use.CALENDAR: Many people complain that the calendar is very plain to look at but I think the interface looks good. you can easily sort by month, week, etc and enter the details of your event. And if you have a to do task list widget on your panoramic homescreen it'll push all the current upcoming to do onto your homescreen widget so you can easily be reminded of things to do.WEB: For web and data usage remember that 3G only works on T-mobile and not AT&T.; I have T-mobile, but not a data plan, I'ma student and I figure it's not worth it since I'm always at a hotspot area. As I'm sure many of you know, and have done your research, it supports full flash, 9.4 right? So that means it displays pages like youtube just as you see it on your desktop without having to cheat =P. Youtube videos are quite laggy while embedded i must agree, and depending on the load of your video, it's not laggy or less laggy in full screen mode. Keep in mind, many phones can't go on youtube at all. The phone is great for web surfing, you can easily go to one page, wait for it to load, while switching to another (press ctrl + backspace to switch back and forth). It doesn't take long to load web pages, but of course isn't anywhere as fast as a desktop computer, but faster than most phones. The built in brower has crashed on me a few times, but not anymore than firefox and IE on my desktop computer.MULTI-TASKING: As stated above I generally use phone while in landscape mode, keyboard out. I generally use the ctrl+backspace hotkey instead of the icon switcher on the top left. This is mainly because the phone isn't too consistant with having the icon there, or while viewing website in fullscreen mode. Spares me of remembering which is which if i can simply use that hotkey. It seems to multi-task fairly well. Althought there are demonstations online of it's multi-tasking abilities of people \"pushing it to it's limits\" it isn't quite usable with 30 applications running, nor is it pratical to actually open all of them at once, it's take more time to find which app you need thank for you to simply reopen it. In practical terms, I probably wouldn't have more than 5 windows opened at once. and probably only 2 or 3 if your running resource heavy apps in the back. And with only a few apps running, yes it works perfectly, and very useful to switch between tasks while copy and pasting, or between webpages while another one is loading.That's all I have to say right now about these 5 things, I have so much more to say about it's other functionalities like: Infrared, FM radio transmitter, speaker quality, practical use.

I wanted it to be a good handset. I was not let down. No reboots, not one. I have installed a lot of the available applications (I don't like saying Apps).

Although WiFi connections caused a worse delay in the conversation (latency) in Skype, but would be nice to have video chats.I took this unit to the job and a couple of co-workers thought it was a cool little device. One of our network administrators, thought about getting one, just by checking out the ssh into a router.Only negatives I can think of is the fact that LEAP/PEAP settings need tweaking. The screen is a little small, even though anything larger than 4\" may cause more radiation going into your brain. The next release, N90X should have a 4\" screen with a QWERTY keyboard.

After my N97 ( which was a almost a complete disaster, finally coming close to good with recent firmware updates) I was in search of a new phone. I considered all the major OS's, webOS, WinMo, Android (did not look at Iphones or BB's). I had already grown accustomed to Symbian, but no stellar phone ran Symbain. Well then I set eyes on the N900, with Maemo 5. Spec-wise it is close to the top, with a few phones offering better specs (snapdragon processors, better screens, higher mp cameras, etc) but I was set on getting another Nokia.Overall it is a pretty amazing device, everything is pretty much awesome, except for the limited phone capabilities and lack of portrait mode. As far as MMS goes, I currently have MMS set up and working on mine, with the help of fMMS (an app easily found on [...] or through the app manager). The web browser is absolutely amazing, can display any webpage without any difficulties. My favorite is Pandora. I know Pandora has apps for the Iphone, BB's and WinMo, but yet has support for Symbian (funny how that is). Well on my N900 I can go to the site, fully view it as I would on my desktop and listen to music whenever I want. Pretty awesome in my book.As good as the phone is, it does need some getting used to. The first day I was struggling to figure out how to navigate the menus,being used to Symbian, but now it's like second nature. So much so that I rarely use my N95 or N97 anymore, I strictly use my N900. Battery life is decent, less so than my other Nokias, usually lasts a day with moderate usage (texts, phone calls, games, web). SPeaking of games, the possibilities are endless, with the help of emulators...For those saying there are a lack of apps in the OviStore, it is true but most are those are paid apps, and the free ones are either trials or of lower quality. There are literally hundreds of apps already available, accessible from the app manager. Adding a application catalog adds to the amount of apps available. If you feeling adventurous you can add the Maemo extras-devel catalog, but read up on the risks associated with these apps first..Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase.

That being said, the n900 is the best phone i've ever used. the user interface is just on a higher level than its competition.the touch screen is awesome, and while i do like multitouch(a lot) on the iphone, i can use my n900 outside in the daylight, which, since i'm not a vampire, is really important to me. apps are better on iphone, but there are apps for everything i NEED the n900 to do in the repos, there's just not as much fun stuff as on apples app store.  The 3g on tmobile is patchy in pittsburgh, but even so, the transition from verizon jas gone better than i expected. Seeing as how i was paying 2x as much $$$ each month to verizon (for a blackberry that tethered) than i now pay to tmobile, i was really worried that tmobiles service would be subpar.  You know what, tmobile's 3g is patchy, but i have voice absolutely everywhere, even out in the sticks where my grandparents live.  I'm really happy with tmobile actually.  Anyway, if I could have 2 phones, i'd have an n900 and an iphone.  I only need one phone though, so it's the n900 for me. Oh yeah, and the keyboard rocks.

Most of my life I used Nokia phones and Nokia never disappointed me. My old phone was n80.I read a lot of reviews about this phone before I bought and I trust Nokia, so I decided to buy this phone and honestly it didn't disappoint me at all. Okay it has bugs but in my opinion these are temporary. New updates will solve these problems. Also there are not many applications for this phone yet but as I said time will change it. I really liked linux based Maemo 5 and the fact that its not limited like other smartphone operating systems.To be able to open all websites includes flash and java is perfect. I feel like i'm using my laptop because i can see websites like i see them from my laptop. Four customizable desktops makes things easier. You can customize each desktop with different wallpapers, shortcuts and contacts. Also I loved the Skype integration. I can see my contacts through my phone's address book and make calls through 3g connection. In Iphone you can only make Skype calls through Wireless internet connection. So that's a very big plus in my opinion. Other than that camera quality is very good and clear. Also the sound quality and dual speakers rocks. It's fun to watch a movie using the stand. Screen is very bright and has good resolution. Integrated FM transmitter makes listening music in your car easier. No need for separate accessories. Map is not bad. I can easily find what I want. The processor is very fast, even though i have many apps open it doesn't slow down and it's easy to switch between applications. I liked the keyboard. Even though the buttons are small, I can type fast because I got used to QWERTY keyboard. 32 gb is pretty much enough for me. I don't even know how I'm gonna fill it up. I dont think i will need SD card for extra space but if I need one day there is even a place for that. The battery life is okay. I can use all day without charging and day by day it gets better.Shortly this phone has many features and they cover it's current bugs. I'm sure after a while Nokia will publish new updates to make this phone perfect. There is no phone in the market that had had no problem in the 1st generation of its kind.

This smartphone is more like a Linux-based netbook.As a phone, it's a bit lacking. no MMS and BT tethering out of the box. Voice quality is exceptional on both earpiece and mic, however.As a music player, it has built-in 32GB flash ROM (28GB is available to user and 2GB for application), added ogg vorbis support, it's 98% perfect, I just wish it has: 1. pitch control for audiobooks, 2. browse files by folder, this is more handy because I have thousands of audio files and they're sorted with folders. A2dp works fine, but it can't co-exist with wifi. I encounter a lot of dropout when wifi is active.Browser is firefox-based and I have adblock installed which makes web browsing is less clutter. You can zoom by either using volume or draw circle on the screen. Flash is version 9, but playing real youtube and other live video sites are fine.Internet radio works well, it can play streaming mp3 (shoutcast or icecast), windows media (as asf/asx), and 3gp (as sdp).About reception, 3G is better than 2G, the phone works best when it's on standing landscape position. I leave the phone locked on 3G (it's available in whole NYC and Yonkers), playing internet radio over 3G is pretty enjoyable, way better than \"local\" FM stations.Since the phone has that powerful hardware and high-res screen, you can expect battery time is short, I manage to get 3.5 hours of streaming audio over 3G without turning screen on halfway, the battery goes a lot shorter if you keep screen lit no matter it's online or not.Internet performance: the phone is backed by 10.8/2.0 HSPA, I even got 5Mbps with T-Mobile, which is the best phone for tethering, BT tethering is not available out of the box and the add-on is flaky. Luckily I managed to use 3G router for wireless tethering solution, the best bet is Aluratek or Zoom with battery model, Cradlepoint doesn't work with N900.This phone has too much potential but most of it is not yet discovered, if you plan to use phone function primary, you should settle for other; however, if you're looking internet-oriented phone and you're using T-Mobile 3G or Wind, this beast works like a dream.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great phone.. maybe in a few years..", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RC558YZTU8C5P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1.

This phone/concept/company is just several times worse.. Makes M$ seem like an angel and a pioneer!6. I want this platform (Maemo) and the phone to work, but it is far from a finished product.I will highlight some negatives and positives.* Coming from a Tilt (Windows Mobile) user, I'm used to a clunky, slow phone. The N900 is fast in user touch, responsiveness. I have loaded a custom windows ROM from xda developers on my Tilt which I have come to finally like (not love!) but I wanted a better browser and didn't want to wait 3 seconds after every click.* Great camera for outdoors. Sucks for indoors.. I mean really sucks indoors. very grainy in bright indoor lighting. The PR 1.2 has made the pic quality better but not anything to brag about. N97 has similar lens and is way better from reviews and pictures posted online.* Great browser to browse full pc version of sites on phone. Flash support for You Tube. But sites that require the latest flash version (like mlb.tv), tough luck. Won't work until they release a new version of Flash in the next several months.* Has a built in FM transmitter. However you need to download a 3rd party signal boost app so that you can listen to the song stream over FM without the hissing noise.* No Java support which is not that big a deal, but not impossible for them to provide for. The Java emulator is slow so that doesn't count.* Emails.. There is a program that can check your emails, it will alert you of new mails as they arrive.. But it will not show in a dashboard, how many unread mails you have.. That is a basic in any smartphone.. NOTE: There is a widget available now that can show on the home screen any unread emails.* Also for emails, you cannot say how to age mails.. or download how many kilobytes.. or the killer... first time you set up emails, if you have 2000 emails like I do, it will show up as Unread. No way to do a mass, \"Mark all as read\"..! Seriously, that shows the lack of thought put into this phone's application.* It does show appointments, to-do etc in the screen. But you cannot create appointments like the first of every month, or M,W,F every other week etc.. You can do the plain vanilla ones like Once a week, daily, workday, month, yearly.. Duh. OR you can input the complex repeats in Outlook or Google Calendar (Sync using Mail for exchange using Nueva sync) and that will carry over into the phone..* Has an app that shows weather info for numerous cities. OMWeather another app is available from the Maemo repository.* GPS, Directions. SUCKS! You can get directions from point A to point B, but no voice guided directions. you have to look at your screen for every turn. Seriously Nokia, how dumb can you be or shameless to tout this half baked product as a sophisticated smartphone? Can't save locations for use. Cannot cache maps on to the device in a straight forward method. You have to do a hack.* Screen is great for viewing photos, videos. Very responsive.* There are two locations to install extra apps from. One is OviStore which is Nokia's answer to Apple's App Store. In time, hopefully that will grow to a useful list. Hardly anything good in there to spend money/time on right now. Second method is to use the Maemo repository (through App Manager) which is full of several free apps that you can download from. Freedom to choose and not be robbed unlike Apple/iPhone.* Great music player that can play songs from the 32 GB internal memory or the Micro SD card slot. Dual Stereo speakers to boot.* Has a good RSS reader and Podcaster app that can be downloaded through the App Manager for free.* I can live with the stupid SIM card under the battery, need to open the cover to access storage card quirks. However I would really like to meet the design head or whoever was heading the design aspect of this phone and several other Nokia phones. The whole team needs to have a lesson.. err.. a PhD in Usability design.* I plan to keep my phone just because I like the browser and the phone will improve with a few planned firmware upgrades in the next year or so.. and I like it purely as a mobile browser in lieu of a laptop.* Would have been nice to have a few buttons on the device to check email, appointments, browser at the least.* No voice dialing? In a high end device, I would expect it to be there. No biggie, I have learnt to use my car's hands free. But still?* One advantage. You can buy this device and get the cheap non-smartphone data plan from your cell phone provider that will help defray costs. Can't do that with iPhone or any phone provided by the carrier. 3g works with the $10 web plan in tMobile.* No Flash 10 support. There are many websites that require version 10(like mlb.tv).* Need to make a quick call while driving? you can't key in the name and get the contact unless you draw the keyboard out, type the name.. and then the contacts with the partial match to what you typed will show up. HOWEVER, this feature will not work on the phone soft keypad!Note: I'm not a Nokia fan boy or a hater. I'm just disappointed that a product like this can come to the market in this day and age. No surprise that Nokia is a dying phone company ceding the high end phone market to the newer entrants. I'm confident even Microsoft will surpass Nokia soon in terms of knowing how to design a smartphone and that is not a compliment to M$!I would sum this to an high end BMW that has a great engine and a nice interior, with great looks. But if you have to either get a kit from them to do it yourself or wait for a firmware fix from the manufacturer for the basic things you would come to expect, would you buy that auto and that too for a hefty tag? Nokia should have waited for another year to release this as it seems like it is a futuristic piece of hardware (with many firmware bugs) that needs apps to leverage them. Stay away for a year or buy it just for browsing and youtube. Better than any smart phone overall? NO way. Could be better with firmware upgrades as long as Nokia provides them in a timely manner. But why pay a premium on a piece of hardware that will fall down in price even as they address the bugs in a few months.. A lame product from a good company that is becoming impotent when it comes to providing great smart phones. I think I will stick to my Windows Phone for now until the next successor for n900 arrives. I so badly wanted this to be my main phone.. Sigh :-( Seriously, Nokia, fire your design and quality control team.Update2: Have had the phone for about four months. The browsing is awesome which is why I've kept it. Using it as a phone sucks. And all the quirks mentioned above still stand. There are some work arounds, but they are like taking a detour. Nokia will take another two years to get the essential features that constitute a smartphone and no one knows how much the gap would widen by that time.Update3: Even after PR1.3, the core quirks of the product still remains the same. No major improvements. Meego is still way behind to get to a point of being usable. Android for n900 (NITDROID) hopefully will be done in a few months. Still a great piece of hardware.

I can't believe even my wife's 5800 music express does this far easier. Nokia!!!2) I cannot delete the contacts who send me SMS!! Huh????? What if I don't want my wife to know that Mariah or Lady Ga-Ga just messaged me? I have used all the phone delete features and nothing happens to the messages! The text disappears but the senders still remain. NOKIA!!!! Grrrrrr!!3) I have to tap on the upper right hand 'close icon' too many times before it closes my appplications. And some of the applications will not open with a single neither a double tap. I have to tap it as if I am sending Morse code. Jeeeez Nokia!!4) Want to delete a particular call from the call log? Yeah right. It's not happening on my phone. I have to delete the whole listing. Grrrrrr!!!!5) Ok, so it's not really a phone, but couldn't Nokia have made it so you can just press a button and the phone pad comes up #in portrait mode#? Why do I have to slide out the keyboard to wake up the phone THEN search the phone for the phone icon THEN.......jeeez!!6) My volume buttons work, but the sound levels remain constant until it goes mute.........You know what people, I think I got a klunked up phone. I wished I was having as much fun as the other owners. Boo hoo hoo. I just wrote to Nokia so I may have to send back my klunker. Will there be a N910?

Note that I have Nokia E63 and was very happy with its performance and was expecting N900 to blow it away. Unfortunately it was not so. The battery life was just awful. After using it for just couple hours the battery indicator showed halfway mark. I was told that I had to run couple cycles to create battery memory. I did not remember reading that for this phone. Other reviewers reported decent battery life and I will check to see if it improves or it may be defective. Note that the E63 initially did have poor battery life but after updating and upgrading the software for the N63, the battery life improved considerably so that I did not feel like I had to look for an electrical outlet.Email is just slow for the N900. I have Gmail account and it just works on Nokia E63. I searched for solutions on the N900 and so far have not found it. It is just inexcusable that basic things like email would perform so poorly compared to the slower cousin like Nokia E63.Map and GPS. The interface is just horrible. Not usable. No memory for previous trips; no Home feature that is expected on GPS (after finishing a trip, just click on HOME to go back home). It is Ovis Map version 1.0 and it does not have speech feature for directions. We had to go back using the Garmin GPS. That was sure disappointing.Contacts: This phone combined the email addresses, chat and IM nicks and Phone contacts into one book. I did not like it. I like to separate the phone contacts from chat and email lists. Maybe it is something to get used to. Right now, to make phone calls, I have to go to Contacts and then select a name to call. With Nokia E63 I was able to type couple letters on the main desktop and it would direct me to the Contact's list starting with those letters. It did not work that way on the N900. It could be solved with software or some kind of programming.Stylus. I was shocked to see the stylus on the phone. That brought me back memories of Palm Pilot back in the 90's and thus gave me a strong feeling that it was going backward and not forward. After using it for couple days, I do have to admit that using stylus is far better and easier than using fingers. Coupled that if you use fingers on the touch screen, it gets oily and dirty fast. The control is very accurate using stylus and it became second nature.Browsing the internet. Not too bad. Sometimes pages load slow but it is readable even with small print. I am nearsighted so it was not a problem seeing the small print. If you were farsighted and or have Presbyopia, it would present problem but you can easily make it larger by moving the volume button up to make screen larger or you can tap it couple times to make it larger. The challenge is with tapping that it sometimes works and sometimes it does not. My friend has the other unit and it does not enlarge when tapping. It seems like there is a way to turn it ON and OFF but I guess we have to read the manual.The Screen. This unit has the most awesome screen I have seen for small factor tablet / phone.They keyboard. Not too bad. I find myself with the thumbs hitting the bottom part of the screen frame. I wish that they could move the screen frame further away from the keyboard.3G Phone connection. Not bad. The WIFI connection works great though. I have downloaded the entire Don Quijote from Gutenberg site and it took seconds. There are not too many apps available for this phone and I wanted a Bible and so I downloaded several books from the Bible on the Gutenberg site and that fulfilled a need for now.My recommendation? If you are just a plain consumer who likes their product to work with no problems, I would NOT recommend this product YET. The iPhone is popular for a reason. I do not have one myself for the simple reason it is locked with ATT and that the batteries are not removable (easily at least).If you are a geek who are into programming and enjoy solving problems (believe me, there are problems with these phones!) this phone would be great for them. I went to Fry's Electronics couple days ago and the phone guy shared that they had 15 on stock and it was gone in a week.I do wish Nokia the best in producing a phone that works and specs sounded great for this phone but the reality is that it is not ready yet. That is disappointing.UPDATE:I reflashed the OS and it works so much better! The battery life became more reasonable. Email responded faster than before (but still slow).Before I used the phone I did update the software but apparently something was not right. I tried updating it but it said I had the most current software. I did check around and all I found were geeks' way to reload the camera OS by using some Linux command. A friend of mine was using Nokia's PC Suite and noticed that it had option to reload the OS and so I tried it. It did work!!********************************************************************May 3rd 2010 update:It has been three months since I had this phone and I am getting to love it!!.I had been loading apps (all free so far) like crazy and one amazing app is the Debian app that installs FULL OPEN OFFICE SUITE with word processor and full spreadsheet!! It also installed the full Firefox 3.1 browser called Iceweasel.I enjoyed taking pictures with Nokia N900. Of course my Canon EOS 5D Mark II takes far better pictures but if I do not have the Canon with me, because of weight consideration etc, then I will miss lots of shots as a result! So having a great camera in cell phone is always handy. Night time pictures are not the best, being quite grainy and all. Which did not surprise me.Firefox just introduced beta mobile version for this phone and it works quite well!! With full flash support and one is even able to save web pages as a PDF file. And also it rotates with the phone. And even though the print is tiny, it is amazingly readable, a testament to the high resolution screen. And also the new Firefox mobile for N900 is magnifiable using the volume control button which is very handy to make it easier to read. But so far I am not able to copy paste from Firefox mobile for N900. I am able to copy and paste text using the IceWeasel browser found in Debian file.About battery life, I am quite a power user and so I had to charge every day. Sometimes twice or three times a day if I am playing games like Angry Birds or the 3D game TuxRacer. Which really did not surprise me. I find it quite acceptable now. I learned to shut off the Bluetooth, WIFI to conserve energy and to lower screen brightness.Oh yes, this phone has Skype functionality built in and can use Skype networks to make phone calls. So you can make free international calls to you Skype friends. Or be in a Skype subscription program and you may have unlimited international calling. Skype was quite easy to set up with this unit. And yes you can text you Skype friends too, using the Conversation app which combined cell phone contacts, gmail contacts, aol contacts, Skype contacts and other contacts into one list. It took a while to get used to it (I was used to different contacts for different usage) but having one list actually makes sense now...I am still waiting for the Maemo upgrade. It is now available in the new models announced in Hong Kong. Hopefully it will fix the email problems. Still SLOW!! Reportedly it fixes several issues with Maemo browser. If they fix that, it probably will be the best browser hands down for any smartphone.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great \" genius\" phone!", "Author": "Crossed Crowns", "ReviewID": "R2ESYH21QCSRDE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far, so good with my n900- I can make Skype calls (I will be getting T-mobile's Pay As You Go, soon), browse the internet, take pretty good pictures (try it outside!) listen to music, watch movies, etc. I don't know how it stacks up against the other phones out there, but for me, the n900 saves me money- the built-in Skype app means I don't have to buy a lot of minutes, and I cancelled my Verizon plan.

Also, you can not customize ringtones for individual people in your contact book. Personally, I'm a multi-tasker and on occasion the device can not handle how fast I use it. It crashes and reboots by itself. And one last issue that I've discovered is when you surf the internet, you will only get a quicker response or connection if you are directly connected to the server at home, your local coffee shop or any other location that provides free WiFi connections.

George \"GeoBin\"", "ReviewID": "RSLODRTNW7RZA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using N900 for the past 6 months. I am pretty happy with the phone, but on the other side unhappy missing basic functionalities form nokia for such an expensive unit.Lot of people commented about PROS here, so I am think no one wants to hear about the PROS much. Here are some of the CONS I have experience over the past 6 months:1. Phone is bit heavy, you need couple of weeks experience to maneuver the phone. Especially the display on/off slide button, power button. Also answering a call.2. First version (PR 1.1) was missing the basic functionality such as #BAL#, #MIN# etc. PR 1.2, nokia included that functionality, so its better to upgrade to 1.23. Another feature lacking is Bluetooth sharing.  If you have car Bluetooth and if you paired you won't be able to access your phone book, call list (missed or dialed) in the car Bluetooth screen. Also the Bluetooth music. I guess this is basic feature in almost all old generation phones, I don't know why it is missing in N900.4. There are lot of new Apps developed everyday, to install some of the apps you should know the Linux commands, you need to get Root access, go to command line and install the app etc.. It is a hassle for some people.5. Nokia is NOT releasing any bug fixes or Product releases frequently. Looks like some diligent technology savvy  people to figure out the  bugs and find solutions for simple issues. You must be a vigilant person in [...] community forum to get info.6.

Physically the top row of the keyboard is better spaced than the Nokia C6 (see my C6 review under my ID: Kingmonkey), which is cramped at the top so when you type your finger touches the top slider portion, but here for the N900 there is more room so typing using the top row of the keyboard is more roomier. Physically again there is a lot of chatter of the N900 being a \"brick\" or bulkier and bigger than most smart cell phones. I don't think so, I think the extra heft denotes quality, I would say about 25% more heft than C6 (the C6 is \"weighty\" too but so is my Blackberry Bold 9000). It's only about an extra .25\" thicker than the C6 and maybe .25\" wider than C6 from left to right, held vertically. The photos of the N900 (C6 too) make it seem like they are big phones, I don't think so, I can hold them in my palm just like my Blackberry Bold 9000 and my Bold is actually wider than the N900. I think the N900 is a good size and is NOT a brick or the size of a brick, again it's SLIMMER than my Blackberry Bold 9000 when you compare them side by side by width, although being slimmer it is thicker than the Bold 9000 by less than an half an inch. Bottom line I don't like big phones and I do not think the N900 is a big phone. It is a relatively heftier phone but dimension wise (lxw) it fits comfortably in your hand although it may weigh down a bit in your shirt pocket or pant pocket (I carry mine in its case and keep it in my bag for the most part).The software operating system is Maemo based. As such, compared to the C6 Symbian op system, it is a little more complicated to master/familiarize yourself with, not as intuitive as my C6. It is a sophisticated system, screen icons are sophisticated looking too. Image wise the N900 leaves the C6 Symbian graphics in the dust.As for the software side, this is where the N900 may leave some frustrated and where most of the complaints are compared to the physical aesthetics of the N900 (people mostly complain about the size and weight of the N900 but as I said above,  it is surprisingly small when I first opened up the box). For my Google calendar I had the same issue as with the C6, You can use MS exchange and set up the Nokia calendar+contacts that way, but again it just populates the main calendar items (no info is populated for calendars you created such as bills, holiday calendars or whatever other Google calendars you customized your calendar with on your PC Google calendar account; it also populates all Gmail contacts which I don't want since I don't want everyone I email to be a my N900's personal \"contact\" list; I suppose there is an option to choose to populate contacts only, calendar only but I don't remember, pretty sure I saw something like that though. Anyway, deleted the calendar and contacts for the reasons stated once I tried using MS exchange to install Gmail, calendar, and contacts. Instead, like what I did for the C6, for the Google calendar I bookmarked the google mobile calendar and use this to access my calendar via the web on the N900. For contacts in the N900 phone book I enter them myself and personalize this way, linking a photo to each name if I want.Now as for linking Gmail,the details . . . what a hassle! (mind you I have an undergraduate AND graduate degree in economics, an MBA, work in finance (analytical work), and teach economics and statistics part time at a State University here in California and community college too so I have at least average intelligence and know my way around computers and all). Like I said above, I tried MS exchange option under settings and it did not work. I did also researched help forums online for ways people did it. Did not work for me after several attempts. I think I went to the email wizard set up and did it this way, after several attempts, wasted a few good hours, the whole afternoon pretty much troubleshooting how to link Gmail to my N900; finally got it to work, but it is slow in refreshing, every time you go to your inbox it refreshes and takes a few minutes. By the way, my C6 I decided to test email it, so I sent one out but it did not go out immediately, so I did another send mail and again I have 2 outgoing emails in my inbox for the C6, I noticed too that the inbox would not populate even though on my PC I see a new email (Gmail on my C6 was working earlier!); anyway decided to uninstall the gmail account on the Nokia C6 and reinstall, maybe there was a glitch, so when I tried to start fresh and install Gmail again on the C6 I can't get pass by the intial set up since when I click \"Start\" it would not go anywhere, I guess the network is down, will try again later. I tried at home and reinstalled gmail on the C6 and now can receive and send emails without the outbox holding the waiting to be sent email, it was almost instant...good. Anyway, back to the N900 . . .the next day the Google talk (preinstalled on the N900, did not have to use a 3rd party app to access Google Talk like I did on the C6, which I used \"Nimbuzz\") it was not connecting. I will need to troubleshoot why the Google Talk is not connecting on the N900 after I finish this review.In addition to the physical keyboard there is a virtual onscreen one, but you have to activate it first under Settings-->Text input and then check mark the box to enable it. Then when you type in the field entry box, for say, a text message, it pops up (the physical keyboard has to be closed for the virtual keyboard to show up)I am beginning to notice a theme with Nokia phones, C6 or N900, linking Gmail to it (email, calendar) is a pain and/or does not work well (Google this topic on the web using key words such as Linking Gmail to Nokia N900 and you'll see a lot of other people wasted a good day on the same thing--I started at 9am or so and it is now 4pm; skipped lunch too, and I just got Gmail set up and the desktop widgets all organized/customized with thoughts of returning the N900 during the frustration). Anyway for the N900 I got it set up and customized the home screens, for the home screen you have 4 screens, I customized with the following on each screen:Homescreen #1: Various ovi apps (since I need to quick access to download more apps when I have time)Homescreen #2:  Various tools such as calculator, calendar, phone settings, ovi mapHomescreen #3: Various bookmarked webpages such as cnbc, yahoo, google calendar (this is how I access my Google calendar: via web), Gmail as a backup in case the email client on N900 is not behaving; web globe icon for web/internet accessHomescreen #4: contacts, people I call most (it's cool in that if there is a photo linked to the contact you see that photo), also a voicemail button,; also have am sms icon, email access icon, I  need to find out how to add Google talk as an icon here for quick accessTo access each homescreen you just flick across the screen like you're flipping pages and the next screen shows left to right or right to left depending how you flick. By the way on web pages to magnify you move your finger in a circular motion clockwise and the opposite to make smaller again.Also the only way the screen will be in portrait mode (vertical) is on the phone use setting, otherwise, everything else you use the phone for, will be in landscape mode, which is disappointing, I'd wish the screen would flip to portrait and landscape for everything; if I remember correctly, my Nokia C6 flips back and forth from portrait to landscape for everything.Bottom line if you want an easy to use phone that is user friendly and intuitive to learn fairly fast (within 1-2 hours), 100% go with the Nokia C6 (which has voice assisted GPS guidance, and the N900 does not), I picked that up in an hour or two and got it all set up. The N900 is a \"sports car\" of a phone, a Ferrari that has transmission problems that is, takes more time to master the set up and screens, widgets and stuff. If you don't enjoy tinkering with gadgets (non techie type and just want a phone that works and easy to set up) the N900 is NOT for you. On the other hand, if you want to sacrifice some functionality/ease of use for looks, get the N900.", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's a brick", "Author": "Philip Skeete", "ReviewID": "R2Y76ZAUS2L4WI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I nicknamed this phone \"the brick\", Nokia can't be serious.

Though there was a delayed release date, I still held out on my purchase to research more finished product reviews.  I found some great reviews and some mediocre reviews.  Most of the Top 4-5 star rating were from editors that I trust; and I know are actually knowledgeable of technology and the product.  So I ordered my N900 and after anxiously awaiting its arrival due to the back orders and popularity; Fed Ex came knocking on my door.  I have dove head first into it for over 12 hours and now that I have used the N900 first hand I can safely say that not only is there raw power under the hood like a BMW Z8 but the quality of the components are up to par with a Bentley Coupe.  Even the USB cables to the included VGA cables are Top of the line.Not only are the Headphones elegant but the Linux based Maemo OS (Linux based same as Google Android OS) is as smooth as butter.  Everything from the vibration of every touch to the to the onboard Flash 9, add to the experience of browsing the web.  The one noticeable issue which seems to be standard on most every phone I have owened is the lack of a proper notification icon.  Even on early Nokia's the tiny square shaped letter signifies the arrival of an sms text.  The HTC G1 has a notification bar at the top which informs me that I have received an email no matter what app is open.  On the N900 the only way to notice if I have a message is to either hear the tone, check the notification light (Which blinks the color of my choosing) Or exiting out of the app I am currently in and navigate to the Task Menu.  It is not something that would make me send the Tablet back for a refund, but it probably will take some getting used to.  Fortunately there is an update that will hopefully not only alter the notification methods, but also enable users to run the device in portrait mode the majority of the time; rather than only in the Blocks game & using the Phone.  The ability to download a 300mb file, listen to internet radio, as well as surf the web seamlessly with out lag is the icing on the cake and outweighs any negatives the N900 possess.A deal breaker for some is that it is bulky and cumbersome, but this Nseries was surprisingly sleek and lighter than I assumed.  Although it is thicker than most devices that attempt to be in its class, it does not have so much weight to it that it would be a nuisance to hold to my ear.  As a developer I plan on using all of the features and with \"theunlockr\" it truly shines.  With everything that The Nokia N900 has to offer the ((M)SRP) of $[...] is a steal.  I do not regret ordering my unit and I am grateful that the wait is over. I now own A unique device that is far better than what I have grown to expect from a Smartphone or Pocket Pc; It is a true mobile computer.", "Date": "December 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "NOKIA N900: The best Advanced Smart Phone and Mini-Computer", "Author": "J. Cauchi", "ReviewID": "R2V0ZZZIVSICS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this phone/minicomputer for about a week and I've tested most of its functions-not a single problem so far.First of all, I have to say that this phone is very fast and responsive right out of the box-maybe due to the fast CPU. Both pictures and videos are very clear and sharp. The video is a bit grainy in very low light but that's expected.Of course, the most attractive part of the phone is its high resolution screen-video and maybe movies look great on the screen-then add the extra animation like effect when closing any app/window-great extra.And both  music and video players are well designed and fast-better than the n97- and the speakers sound is great and have clear sound without excessive base.Since, it's Linux based, I hope somebody sometime int he future writes an app to have a virtual desktop-like Windows maybe?Overall, the N900 is a pretty well advanced/very fast phone/mini computer, has great video/photo capability and it's highly customizable.N900 Pros and ConsPros:1. Bright and sharp screen resolution.2. Better video resolution than most phones: 800x4803. Very responsive to touch and very fast to open/close apps.4. Virtual keyboard is best I've seen on any phone-including Iphone.5. Slide out keyboard has a computer-like feeling and functionality.6. Ability to customize menus/apps/windows.Cons:1. Video has no light-like the N97.2. Camera has less functions than the N97-No sequence taking-3. No hand-writing? Maybe it's no needed.4.

That is a few i can say about it. TO be more detailed, I'd like to mention several features that make N900 superior to other mobile phones.First of all the touch screen is very finger-friendly and for 2 month untill now I havent yet used a stylus that is supported.Keyboard is even better. Well after N82 (that has relatively small and narrow buttons)it was a bit strange to work with qwerty keyboard, but now i say: there is no a better keyboard than that.SMS and Skype chats are displayed very comfortable. Every time you recieve an sms or IM and write one for answer, those chat windows are displayed one above another.Maemo itself (that is the OS of N900) works VERY quick. Lots of usefull applications can be found over internet that one can install on this phone.Camera is awesome. Compared to my N82 camera that is 5 megapixel Carl-Zeiss optical lens, N900 camera shoots pictures with much better quality/widescreen resolution.Internet browsing became more advanced after you can watch flash player content on web, like Youtube etc.Well battery life could be better. If you have your N900 all the time connected to a wireless network and install applications, browse web, take pictures and listen to music then your battery will hardly last one day. But only for conversations and sms, this phone battery can easily last 2 days.Compared to N810, this model is much more improved, faster and is compatible with GSM.What I dont like is that i can't see my online skype friends unless they dont call me or send IM.Thank you and, I realy recomend to buy N900 if you like to have the Jet-Fighter of the modern phones.", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "one of great online shopping store", "Author": "S.

All my mobile phones until now are nokia, but the next one will not be.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia did not do itself proud with the N900", "Author": "Demoncrat", "ReviewID": "R2SVXPXYIJYEIQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First of all, I am a long-time Nokia user. I started with the 3650, and then moved to the N90, which I liked a lot.I have to say, however, that Nokia did not do itself proud with the N900. I would give it zero (0) stars if I could. The battery does not last even a full working day. (The N90, in contrast, lasted a couple of days.) That was without exercising the phone hardly at all: a dozen phone calls, two pictures, no Internet access of any kind. That's essentially just on standby. There is no Internet access over GPRS, which is puzzling. I had a T-Mobile plan for the N90, and I just moved the SIM card from that phone to N900, using the same plan. On the N90, T-zones appeared as a choice for Internet and I could use it; that choice doesn't even appear on the N900. The user interface is not great; it seems to be a bit touchy (yes, that's a pun). Sometimes tapping an icon several times has no effect whatsoever. The N900 doesn't work with all features of OVI Suite and it doesn't work with all features of PC Suite (image transfer). So I have to use both for different things. OVI Suite will sync the N900 calendar with the Outlook calendar on my PC, but it seems to be confused about dates and times -- bad for calendar functionality. Yesterday it popped up an alarm for an event at the right hour, but the wrong day; today it just popped up an alarm for an event with an alarm set for 15 minutes in advance of the event, but the alarm went off an hour and 15 minutes in advance of the event. (Testers, where are you?) The Bluetooth functionality is abysmal. My car has a Bluetooth connection for the phone -- essentially the audio system in the car is the Bluetooth headset. The Bluetooth functionality with the N90 worked perfectly from the get-go. The N900 loses its connection after hanging up, sometimes it won't answer, sometimes it will appear to call but there is no audio, neither speaker nor microphone. For the camera, the geotagging functionality appears not to work, even when it is configured: After I take a picture, the screen shows a message indicating that it is geotagging the picture. When I examine the metadata in the photo in Photoshop, there is no geo information included. Perhaps I need to sign up for some additional service for that, but the manual isn't clear on that. And on the manual, the Nokia folks certainly took to heart the minimalist mantra that's circulating among documentation professionals -- if the manual were any more minimal, it would be invisible. I am returning this phone.

It should do it all, and it is close, but not quite there - yet.The problems with the cell phone functionality begin with a strange requirement to swap back-and-forth between \"landscape\" and \"portrait\" (a 90-degree movement of your hand) in order to initiate a phone call.

I made the jump and now have gone back to the G1, appreciating it all the more.Typing on the N900 is a horror. I thought the G1 keyboard was small -- the N900 makes the G1 feel like a classic Northstar. Now, that might seem like a small quibble. It's true that the screen is larger, the resolution greater, the camera a real point-and-shoot replacement, the radios are strong... but you're going to be using the keyboard a LOT with an N900. The apps aren't quite there yet. You're going to be doing a great deal of gluing and crafting to get things to run at first -- expect to spend time in the root shell. For a programmer, that's not so bad... but coupled with a bad keyboard, it's a deal-breaker.As a test, show me how to make a percent sign on the hard keyboard of an N900. I'll save you the trouble, you can't make one. You have to light up the symbol table and choose it on-screen.What's more painful to me is the glacially-slow updates to the Nokia software, especially when compared to Google. Ovi Maps should have been turn-by-turn for N900s already... where is this? Why is MMS support an add-on? Why is rotation such a difficult task on this device?  microUSB?  Really, I have to go get more adapters and cables now?  At least a 3.5mm headphone jack is there.By punting this over to developers, Nokia is saying that they cannot solve your problems. They aren't leading in the space. Moreover, the muddled roadmap is killing them. Developers want minimal targets, and Nokia keeps changing the targets. OS2006-8, Maemo, Meego... sorry, NoGo. EasyDebian is an interesting *TOY*, it's not the end game, not with all the difficulty around porting existing apps to be functional on a small screen.Here's the minimum Nokia needs to succeed with this device, with this platform and program:-one target roadmap, fully detailed, and predictable;-more frequent shipping of code, even in point releases, to develop a culture of success, progress, and momentum;-crushing the outstanding UI issues and expected functionality complaints by delivering;-provisioning real ARMEL tools to get as many existing Debian apps onto their platform as possible.In short, they have to make it as easy as Android development, and give devs a single SDK target. There's too much flux, too much unsettled, and the N900 reflects that.  I wish this phone was more polished, I do.  I might have been able to accept the awful keyboard if it had more finished functionality, but in the end, it's going back.--#", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "eh", "Author": "B.

I had a Nokia N95 8gb which I loved, but it was getting on. So, I had to start looking for a replacement.Gadget freaks were drooling in anticipation of this device. I love gadgets, but I'm not a technogeek, or a programmer, and don't know linux. I didn't know symbian, either, and never needed to with my previous Nokias. Everything that I needed to work, worked, and I was happy.I saw the promo videos for the N900, and it looked fantastic. It would support video calling, bluetooth, eg all the functionns of my N95 8gb, PLUS a nice, big touch screen, and great web browsing capabilities. I got the N900, in June, 2010. There was an update available immediately, and I installed it.At first, I thought it was great. It was easy to browse the web (if a bit touchy at times, with regard to resizing the screen). Screen was sharp and clear, easy to watch a movie on the plane with the nice little \"kickstand\" on back. But the battery can't handle much of that, and if you're on a long trip in Economy class with no place to recharge, bring a lot of batteries along because you'll need them. Battery life is positively woeful. And who came up with the idea of locating the memory card under the battery, anyway?I soon began to discover that this phone wasn't all that I'd expected and hoped for, when I was dazzled by all those motion graphics in the Nokia promos. Sure, I could Skype, but not very well (on both LAN and via phone network). I gave that up. Video was too jerky.Next, I discovered that a lot of \"basic\" features from my 3 previous Nokias, were missing on this one. For example, no contact groups or distinctive ringtones for groups or individuals. Irritating, but I could live with it, I guess (grudgingly). But the complete lack of MMS? That was infuriating! I found an app and installed it, but it doesn't allow any text with the photo. Annoying. And it was 3rd party, not Nokia.I've had the camera lock up on me a few times, to date. The phone had to be shut down and restarted each time.While visiting a popular video site, I was told I needed to update my Flash player (and where to go to do that). But I tried each one on that page (under linux), and none worked. I have no idea why. So no video from that site.The GPS is no good to me, not if I have to keep my eyes on the thing and end up in a ditch.My biggest complaint was the disappointing Calendar. I'd assumed this calendar would have the functionality of previous Nokias. WRONG. It is fiddly, and not user friendly. I positively hate having to scroll through the times to set it (it seems a gadgety thing meant to show off the touch screen functions), and when I went to input events/anniversaries/birthdays via PC suite with alarms, the alarms didn't work. I can set individual \"tasks\" on the device itself with an alarm (like a meeting or an appointment), but not \"events\" which repeat (eg birthdays). I really, really hate that part, as the Calendar in previous Nokias worked beautifully for me and was a real asset. It appears that I will have to enter birthdays and such every single year on this device, if I want the reminder alarm (which is handy when I have to call someone overseas to say \"Happy Birthday\" at the appropriate time for them). Had I known this, I would not have bought this device.I'm sick of hearing iPhone and Android users talking about all the cool apps they can get. What can I get with this (I was lucky to get an app for MMSing, and that capability should have come with the phone. It's expected to come with a mobile phone these days!)? Games? I don't play games. I want genuine applications, and they're seriously lacking. By all the excited anticipation pre-release from the techno-heads, I thought they'd have a million apps written by now. It doesn't look like anyone's doing anything. If someone could please give me back the old Nokia calendar, I'd be very grateful and wouldn't hate this device as much as I'm starting to.Nokia has been absolutely horrible - arrogant to the extreme. They've unleashed this on the public, and are refusing to fix some things, and won't even acknowledge others. It seems they're focused elsewhere. Had I but known that they were moving on from this OS, I would've done the same and kept walking past it to a different manufacturer.

At the time of N95's release, Nokia was truly the king of mobile phones.Unfortunately, things has gone straight downhill since. It is unfathomable that a huge company like Nokia, with its experiences and resources, can keep disappointing their customers by making subpar \"flagship\" devices. More like \"failureship\" devices.Nokia has made statements regarding the Maemo5 platform being implemented only on the company's most prestige and top-end luxury phones, while Symbian will be the mainstream smart phone platform. However, the pricing of the N900 suggests otherwise, at only 30 dollars more than the N97, where the line between the two devices with different target audience wears thin.My own experience with cellphones? I burn through about 20 cellphones every year.I've used the iPhone, Android based phones, and many others.  I've pretty much used every Nokia phone released last year. From lower-end ones like 5800, E63, E71, to N85, N86, N97, and now N900.Some readers wondered what phones I've used. I looked up some of the unboxing pictures and receipts I kept and here's what I can recall:Nokia:53106120cE63E71N96N97N85N865800 PRC red5800 N.A. silverSamsung:I458U608U708I908I7500F250LG:KU970 ShineKE770 Shine BarSony Ericsson:W810iM600K550W595Moto:razrrizrkrazrA1200 MingE6A810Apple:iPhone 3GLenovo:i60Meizu:M8HTC:G2I've had my share of disappointments with the 5800 and the N97. Back then I firmly believed the merits of a resistive screen and the quality of Nokia devices and design. Not anymore after I've used the G2, the Galaxy, and the iPhone 3G. (And as you can see, I stay away from WinMo devices. I'd like to try one of those someday)-----------------------------------------Where has Nokia failed:- Inferior build quality. Nokia used to make robust phones with awesome build quality. Admittedly they still do, like the E71. (but not anyway E devices after)But the N900 is pastic-y and, to quote from one of my friends, \"feels flimsy\". I showed my friend who's been using a razr forever the n900, and that's the first thing he said, \"flimsy.\" Sadly I have to agree. The slider feels cheap, with a HUGE gap between the two pieces. You can't feel the snap of sliding as with the N97/mini, only slight-mushy resistance that tells you two pieces of plastic and rubbing against each other.I don't know why Nokia insists this \"snap on\" battery cover mechanism. You have to barbarically \"tear\" the battery door off the back and violently shove it back on. Doesn't feel high end when you have to do that. A locking mechanism like on the E71 would be nice. Once again, Nokia states that Symbian is not abandoned, that Maemo5 will only be on the company's most top-end devices. And if this is the kind of \"top-end\" luxury Nokia has to offer, I seriously question the company's future.- Inferior parts. Nokia has been using cheaper interior components lately, like its GPS receiver. Without any A-GPS, my HTC G2 can connect with a satellite and show it on maps in like 10 seconds. (Although without data, the navigation map is blank, but it still knows the location and coordinates). My N86, N97, and N900? Cannot find any satellite. I'd leave the Ovi Map app on for hours, and they never do tell me where my location is. Have done side-by-side comparisons. (Also tried rebooting phones, did not work)GPS is quick to locate with data service on. But unless you got unlimited data, it's going to cost you a fortune to use GPS feature on this phone.- Resistive screen is painful to use. One of the reviewer said you can barely tell the difference between the N900's resistive screen to a capacitive one. Wrong.With the Maemo 5, Nokia tried to make the UI as finger friendly as possible, with large icons and stuff. But resistive screen doesn't require large press area, it requires precision. Say you are trying to press the \"end call\" button. It is red and large (see the stock picture). Instinctively you try to use your thumb to press it. Well that touch is not going to register, at all, unless somehow it thinks you are trying to get to speakerphone (the large bar above end call).The point is, you have to use the tip of your finger nail to get your touches precisely registered.In many aspects, the Maemo 5 with a resistive screen is WORSE than 5800XM. At least with the 5800, they didn't attempt to have mimmicky features, such as kinetic scrolling. With the N900, you have to deal with terribly implemented kinetic scrolling and other such \"fancy\" features. It can never tell whether you are trying to select a contact or just trying to move the screen down. Not to mention the scrolling is neither smooth nor pleasant to use.Plus, the mechanics of the resistive screen makes it so that they cannot put a hard, scratch-resistant glass over it like they do with capacitive. You better buy a screen protector.- Complications of use.With Maemo 5 you can do many novel things, like hooking up wireless to a PS3 controller, and play the NES emulator on the N900, with the PS3 controller, with the screen TV-outed to your TV. But to do that, and to use many other features enabled by the powerful Maemo5 platform, you have to go on a maemo-forum and dig through hundreds of threads to find a solution.The menu layout is terrible. The homescreen is awfully implemented. I can never switch home screens when I swipe, especially coming from a HTC G2 and an iPhone before that. Finding the folder, menu, or setting that I want to use takes a long time. The way they organized the apps and icons are absolutely illogical. You'd be spending hours trying to find a feature and when you at last have found it in the most unexpected place, you'd be like \"OMG why would it be there?\"The joy of owning different phones for me, is to figure out all the UI elements, to tweak all the settings and programs and stuff. I lost that desire on the N900, because navigating around the phone is not a very pleasant experience.- The UI is not as fast as some people suggests. I mean, compared to the 443MHZ processored 5800, N97, and other Symbian s60 v5 powered phones, the N900 is pretty fast. But I don't know what people are talking about when they say that the UI is speedy and breezy, and that you can multitask with 20 screen open without slow downs. (probably over-exaggerated  but still..)When comparing this phone to the Nexus one, I was trying to convince myself that the 600MHZ processor with a dedicated graphic chip is going to be better than just a snapdragon of 1GHZ. It's not.Keep in mind though, that the N900, being a mobile computer, has REAL full multitasking. The iphone has NO multitasking unless you break several federal laws and have Jobs curse your name for it, and the android has something Like a full multitasking but not quite.- The N900 does not suffer from lack of apps. There are tons of older maemo OS apps (most are compatible with Maemo5)and websites that have dedicated repository, which you can add to your own app store. But It is a pain to search online to find them.----------------------Sure the OS is powerful and lets you do novelty things,but WHO IN A MILLION YEARS would want to do that? not to mention the HOURS of trouble you have to go through, dealing with the disgusting UI, the terrible touch screen, and the flimsy feel of the phone, just to get it to work?The overall presentation and experience with the phone makes me NOT want to use the phone. It is too much trouble and painful to use. Plus it's huge, and I feel like they could've stuck a 3.7 screen on there.Since N95 we saw little improvement from Nokia's flagship devices. From minor UI tweaks to decreasing quality, while the camera has stayed at a pitiful 5MP, while Sony Ericsson and Samsung keeps turning out 12MP phones with HD recording. With the N900 Nokia had a good chance to turning things around. This should be their premium high-end device. But oh Nokia manages to disappoint and fail once again.And you know that in a few month they will be so busy making the N98 and Maemo6, that you will be left without firmware updates, and by the end of Q3 when Maemo6 comes out, with the most minor UI tweaks, you won't be getting anymore firmware updates, and you can't even update the N900 to Maemo6 without flashing it yourself, risking bricking the phone and voiding warranty. This is luxury. This is top-end. This is the best user experience Nokia has to offer.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not user friendly", "Author": "David Lim", "ReviewID": "R8XEFOB3HN5B8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned the iPhone 2g / 3g, and after having the N900 for 2 weeks,-incredible desktop GUI,-internet browser,-and camera... which you have probably already read about.-native tetheringbut...-my bluetooth became defective, ie. would not turn on, connect, etc.-the phone functions are very difficult to use.-exclusively two-hand centric-to do a hard reset is much more than holding down two buttons for a couple seconds (ie. iPhone), you need (Windows, download several programs and hold down buttons)-no user-friendly internet music apps, ie. Pandora, Slacker, Last FM... to do so you need to modify script (not fun)In conclusion:-I ended up returning this N900, it seems that Nokia does not have a lot of attention towards this particular device.-I got a little worried about the micro-usb problem, though it did not happen to me.-This device is for a Linux enthusiast that has some level of programming and script skill. This literally is a computer first, a phone second. It was nice to sit down and browse around on this device, but if you are driving, or multi-tasking (which you shouldn't do, but most do...) it is totally out of the question to use this. At times, the would've liked to browse sites like the iPhone does on certain pages with large text. This device made me feel like I was straining my eyes to read the fine text (and the text is very fine due to it's high def screen).If you think you might like this device, buy it through Amazon, if you don't like it in 30 days, just send it on back.Also... I ordered the Nexus One to replace this, it seems it would suit me better. Some might call me lazy for not wanting to learn how to really optimize using the N900, but I feel like a device should make my life easier and not more complicated.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Much to my disappointment...", "Author": "Brandon", "ReviewID": "R21UQ02P1SWBRW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Nokia N900 was just not up to par like I had imagined it'd be. I'm a cell phone fanatic and I had (key word, HAD) a strong dislike for iPod products and because of this I ventured away from the Iphone 3GS in order to purchase this phone, as I had heard that it was much better. Let's review the Pro's first since this will be a short list.Excellent cameraCan't go wrong with Karl Seiss optics, this one is a heavy-hitter in this phone and provides excellent resolution and crisp, clear pictures along with stunning visual.Music volume, speaker placement and overall sound experienceThere are two speakers on each side of the cell phone and provide very clear, crisp highs and warm mids for a great listening experience through all genres of music, but on top of that they have the 3.5mm jack for the headphones and they are also very high quality. The headphones issued are of good quality, very sturdy and powerful for their size.Build/ConstructionThe build of the cell phone is great, feels strong and well-constructed, and it's fairly difficult to drop upon exiting your vehicle because you always know where it's at. The downside of the weight of the phone is, well it's weight. It has it's advantages to the weight, such as the GRAND 32GB internal memory with optional 16GB increase.Now onto the Con's, which contain both cold hard facts about the phone as well as some minor annoyances.KeyboardAll right it doesn't count because I knew it was three rows before I purchased it but it could have been a LOT more functional, it misses a whole lot of keys and because of this means that many keys are only available on the on-screen keyboard, and there are also keys that are missing from there (search for the ~ and let me know if you find it)ResponsivenessThis is probably the biggest complaint I have on this phone. It does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING without lagging including the simplest functions. When surfing the internet with the internet stick, it will pretend to load the whole screen but actually it's only showing the image so if you begin surfing you may select something you didn't mean to. This can potentially be a huge problem.MultitaskingThe multitasking function is a staple of this phone, however if you're listening to music that better be all you're doing or else it will cause the music to skip loudly and abruptly, and it also slows down the phone so it actually DOESN'T multitask like it should.BrowserYou can use the N900 almost like a real computer, except for the fact that it isn't so that means there are certain things you can't do such as having multiple screens open at once and still remaining functionally acceptable. The phone boasts being able to accomplish many more things that other phones can't, but as of right now I haven't seen the N900 do anything that the iPhone 3GS hasn't accomplished (and better I should say) with smooth and rapid efficiency.ChargingThe ONLY charger that works with the phone is the original high efficiency charger that comes in the package, and since the battery life is less than optimal (we'll cover that shortly) it's tough to use your $400.00+ cell phone in places that a charge isn't readily available, such as on road trips or places without outlets.Battery LifeWith a smaller battery than it's older sibling (N97) but more funcionality you can imagine that you don't get too much life out of it, especially when you're spending all your time trying to navigate through the device in an attempt to circumnavigate the internet while listening to a couple of tunes, heaven forbid it actually works.App marketNavigating Maemo's open app platform is very cold and unfriendly, it describes nothing of the app's functionality and if you're not a techie or at least familiar with these terms you won't understand what the applications are about. It's also very depressing to look at in my opinion. There also are very few as it's still very new, and forget getting the majority of ones you could be familiar with if you're overseas, it won't happen.Small annoyances include when the phone is plugged into the charger, it's a cat and mouse game whether the phone even turns on or not, there is only one stylus so if you lose it you better have purchased another, the font for the phone is hideous, making the applications and funtions of the phone ACTUALLY function is a matter of how technologically sound you are because you've got to figure it all out yourself, and if something doesn't work (like a chat or internet protocol service) it doesn't tell you why. It merely states there has been an error or something along those lines. The stand is flimsy and watching movies? That's an entire beast of it's own.Good luck if you purchase it; but i'd most definitely recommend something else.

In addition, it was further enhanced using downloads from a newly installed WiFi extension to my wired lan.  Subsequently, both the Qt Creator approach and the scratchbox approach worked to produce programs that could be loaded (via usb) and run on the N900 natively.  The scratchbox emulator looks to be perfect. If you are unfamiliar with linux, the learning curve to program this device could be rather steep (hobby programmer).Do not buy it rating!  I bought this after careful review of comments and researching the web resources available for this device.  It sounded good. The primary reason you would buy this thing would be because it is \"open\" (linux) (open as far as SIM card too) and you expect to find expanded applications (like through easy Debian) and develop for yourself.  1.  However, you cannot open the device to these areas because root privileges are not included and you must download an application to obtain those privileges.  The problem is if you do not have WiFi or cannot get it to work and you do not have a service provider because you want to see if it is worth it, then you are screwed.The applications screen is not intuitive and often counter-intuitive.  Be prepared to do a lot of typing on the micro keyboard if you go to the shell (terminal).  The screen is really small so you better have good eyesight after being used to a 24in LCD monitor.2. The second part concerns hobby programmers like me who use Qt (linux) to program for the desktop and are quite happy with it and it works (not Qt Creator which I never got to work even with their own tutuorial; kdevelop IDE just works period; text editor and shell script compile and run just works).  You read about the Nokia SDK and set it up because it will lead to allowing you to build applications using Qt for mobile devices.  Once again the Qt Creator cannot build or run an application of their own tutorial for the maemo platform or their simulator.  Do not bother to complain about it because then the critic gets criticized instead of people focusing on the problems. Therefore, you are screwed a second time.I am merely relating my experience and I have not tried other programming environments for the armel architecture such as Maemo 5 SDK (GTK toolkit) (this is not i386 machine or AMD64 for example and needs its own armel builds).  Debian supports armel so if you got past my 1. above you have stuff to download using your service provider.  If you get past my 2. above as well as 1., then you are very happy to create programs for your own cellular phone/computer and you are possibly willing to shell out money for an additional line, data, and texting with your favorite service provider.

The maps are very slow. Its not a true GPS as you need internet connection (either through GPS or Wifi) to find your location. The GPS position moves slowly when you are driving. You don't have the flexibility to click on any point in the map and add it as a via point. Sure you can add point A, point B, Point C in an order for the GPS to give you a route from Point A to Point B and then to Point C. But if you want to modify a route the GPS gives you good luck with that.Now coming to the Gyro sensor. Its not that great. Sure you can change the orientation of the phone and other stuff with the Gyro. But you can use the GPS and internet in vertical orientation. Also you don't have multi-touch (which is only available in a hand full of phones) but atleast Nokia should've given people the ability to zoom into anything and take it to any zoom percentage. However you could achieve this by pressing the Volume Up and Volume Down button. But its not intuitive.The touch screen can be called a touchscreen because that's what it is. However it is no where as responsive as an iphone, nexus one, droid, droid incredible or other great smartphones. You really have to touch the same place two or three times.Also when you click on text fields the onboard touch screen keyboard doesn't pop-up instantly. Now coming to the lock button. The lock button is at the bottom of the phone rather than top of the phone and so it can't be unlocked with one hand (how stupid is that design).Now coming to the app store it sucks big time. nothing compared to that of Android or Iphone.

Don't get me wrong, I like the Blackberry for what it does best - push email, contact management, and phone communications.  However, in the past year, I have contracted \"smartphone envy\" and \"Blackberryitis\".  My wife has an iPhone and I have friends who have HTC Android devices.  I am not going to cover the pros and cons for each of these platforms although pull email is not as nice as push email.I really wanted to buy this device, but after reading today's announcement that Nokia is not going to port Meego to the N900, I have decided against purchasing this device.  I am really disappointed in this announcement because I believe that Nokia is going to take all of the mistakes in Maemo and correct them in Meego.  Of all of the problems reported in the 172 reviews on Amazon of this device, I would surmise that Meego will correct all of these problems and, after the great experiment of the N900, the first Meego device will truly be the device to purchase.Since Nokia is partnering with Intel on Meego, Intel is not going to ruin their reputation by abandoning the platform.  I am rest assured that Meego will be around for years.  As to why Nokia is tarnishing their reputation, well, I guess they will polish the tarnish with Intel.  This is a business decision by Nokia.Therefore, to the potential buyer, I would suggest abandoning the idea of buying the Nokia N900, as tempting it is, and wait for the Meego phone or you can go with Nokia's Symbian^3 phone if you don't understand how to or want to tinker with Linux.If I can treat the symptoms of my \"smartphone envy\" and \"Blackeryitis\", I am going to stay on my Blackberry until the Meego phone is released, otherwise, if I cannot wait to access more apps and the REAL internet and not Blackberry's interpreted Internet, I am going to cure the ailments and move to an Android device as I cannot deal with Apple's control of the iPhone including the fact that I cannot change the battery.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "not what i was expecting from a supposed iPhone Killer...", "Author": "omer ben zaken", "ReviewID": "RJRJ1Q3NUL8I0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "battery is beyond words. turns dead after 3-4 hours with WiFi switched on. with GPS,2-3 hours. randomly dies after 2 hours with WiFi switched off . can't rely on it for nothing,i carry 2 phones and the N900 is one heavy device...Camera's quality (5Mp)is far worse than the iPhone 3GS (3Mp) and the flash is poorly located, creating reflection that destroys any 'flashed' picture.don't go there.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "NOKIA N900", "Author": "Fernanda Lopez Palacios \"FERNANDA\"", "ReviewID": "R2UJW0W088SPS7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just got my new N900 and since day one the screen was always freezing and today the charger already doesn't work.

Who cares how good the phone is when they are ripping off our (US companies) technology to build it.Read about it here: [...]Excerpt...OVERVIEWBecause of the disarray, variations, and confusion associated with implementation of Second Generation (2G) mobile communication systems, organizations were established to control and unify standards for 3G (and now 4G).  The unification of these organizations (ARIB - Japan; ATIS - USA; CCSA - China; ETSI - Europe; TTA - Korea; and TTC - Japan) culminated in the establishment of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).  Members are bound to and obligated by 3GPP IPR Policies to declare essential patents in a timely manner, and participants must agree to license that declared IPR to all members on FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) terms.  Utilization of this IPR may be executed while FRAND rates are being negotiated.It is important to understand that Interdigital joined ESTI (and ARIB and ATIS) in 1999, as one of the few non-manufacturing members.  The manufacturers had the advantage of cross-licensing their IPR amongst each other; however, non-manufacturers had nothing of value to cross-license.  Remuneration was only through direct revenue from IPR royalty rates.The 3GPP's request for support of their proposed anti-trust exemption received unilateral approval from Japanese, European, and U.S. government oversight bodies, thereby negating the need for usual and ordinary regulatory scrutiny governing matters of mobile wireless industry fair trade.  Armed with this approval of the 3GPP request, a scheme receptive to 3GPP members (currently 345 partners) targeted high IPR demands of U.S. R&D; non-manufacturers, Qualcomm and Interdigital. Finland's Nokia Corporation would become the designated sole litigant for the original cartel; Ericsson and Motorola would remain on the sidelines, later to be joined by Samsung.As an indirect consequence of action by the DOJ and direct consequence of Nokia's sustained litigation against Qualcomm, Interdigital, and now Apple, Pennsylvania based IPR developer Interdigital has received zero 3G IPR royalty-licensing fees since inception from MEN and certain others.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very frustrating overall", "Author": "Fabrice DI MEGLIO", "ReviewID": "R309IPCH4UHT2V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nokia had a potential good opportunity with this device but overall screwed it up big time.The screen is very frustrating for previous iPhone users and I would say anybody that is used to a capacitive screen. The size said to be 3.5'' is actually quite smaller than the iPhone one. Maybe inches in Finland are not the same as in US. The colors are also just so so. Last but not least the touch behavior is very erroneous: just try to swipe in a list of items (like emails for example) and you will see that you accidentally click without doing it. Soooo frustrating.The Login screen is just a bad joke compared to the n770 and n800 that I own already. Quite ugly and difficult to key in the code. Wooow such a strong regression compared to the previous models.Then Gmail integration is just screwed up: this device and OS version is NOT able to handle my inbox with something like 16K messages. That's a bad joke indeed. The mail application is just freezing without any reason (jezz, I am on a Wifi connection with a BIG bandwidth).There are no apps or so little like a couple dozen. That's a joke too. No twitter app, no facebook app just widgets that are plain useless.The browser could have been nice but the very small size of the screen makes the browsing experience a pain. I am missing big time here the screen estate from my n800. And its time for rendering complex pages is just so so.The keyboard is so cramped. I have medium size fingers and they do not fit correctly. Keying is such a pain indeed and of course there is no autocompletion into the text fields for helping you. Nice job Nokia.The GPS takes time to synchronize and the map is just not attractive and not very readable. Yes Nokia, you cannot compete with Google Maps and you should have done a partnership with them to provide the user a better experience.The phone by itself is just ok and not appealing. It forces you to change from landscape mode to portrait mode and accessing the phone is not really easy when you are dealing with other apps. Woow, even the phone features have been screwed up. Unbelievable.As a sum up, my 2 hours experience was very bad and I decided to return it without regret.Nokia has done a very bad job here and it is such a shame for them as I was sold to have such a device.
