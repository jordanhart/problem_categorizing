It is my fist smartphone with data. the screen is huge for great display. when i first got it it was so fast. and after downloading just a few apps it slowed down dramatically. When I try to go to my camera i have to wait and wait for it to get to  it. when i want to go into the gallery i will sit and wait for the pics to load and it takes forever. I have to back out of it and go back in. When i search for something on the browser and select the one i want to go to..if i hit the back button it completely exits out of the browser. I have to research all over again. I do like how you can download diff themes for the phone and the sms. it is very \"personalize-able\". if you stay on the internet or just the phone itself alot the phone will die before the end of the day. I keep a car charger and just automatically plug it up when I get in the car. It has alot of memory and is very easy to use and understand. overall i love it. I just dont like the occasional slowness.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worst Phone I've Ever Owned", "Author": "Shane", "ReviewID": "R3HPSYFTHH2LQC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is by far the worst phone I've ever owned.  That's not hyperbole.  It's the worst, and by large margin.  Actually, it's the worst electronic product I've ever owned, and I owned a Power Glove!  So, let's cut straight to the cons:- The least interesting con is the short battery life. It's 4G, that's just how it is.  No different than any other 4G.- TONS of completely worthless installed apps that you can't delete.  Why on Earth would I want a Blockbuster app on my phone? Can you put a Borders app on there for me too?-  Phone randomly reboots, screenlock freezes, or phone completely blacks out (but is still on judging by lights).  I can't emphasize this enough, because it happens shockingly often.  Every day.  That's not an exaggeration.  At least one of those things happens every single day, the latter two requiring the battery to be removed and reinserted angrily.  The back of my phone is now loose from having to do this so often.- Progressing... <-- Get used to seeing that anytime you touch your screen.-  Randomly changes ringtones and alerts.  It's weird to wake up to death metal (it was a phase) in the middle of the night when you receive an email.-  Often decides that you don't need to be notified that you have a message or a phone call, an especially helpful feature when you have a pregnant wife.-  Screen lock when you are on a call that requires you to use the dialpad.-  Keyboard decides when you are done typing, not you.  It decides you've said all you need to say and just disappears.-  Picture organization is completely random.  Just took a picture?  Have fun going through all the folders to find which it decided to put it in.-  \"Billing not supported on this version of the Android Market\"  <-- No idea what this means, but my phone advises me of it every other time unlock the screen.  I would look it up, but I no longer care with this thing.  I'm just biding my time until replacement.-  No control over running programs.  You can manually turn them off or use an app killer all you want, but resistance is futile.  \"What's New\" will continue to run without actually providing any \"New\" information.  Also, expect 3 maps to be running for no reason.  I deleted all map-related apps. Still 3 maps draining my battery and data.-  Don't bother listening to music on this thing.  I haven't been able to hear an entire song yet, and it's been well over a year.  Sometimes I forget to charge my iPod (yes, I still have one because my phone sucks), so I give it another try, knowing full well it's not worth carrying the headphones around all day unused.There are some positives, but who cares?  I guarantee they don't outweigh the cons.  Not even close.  Let's try one just to be sure though:-  Call quality is pretty good.  Until the phone decides to reboot in the middle of it.  Full circle.Don't.do.it.  If you think it's just my individual phone, go check out some other reviews for this turd.  You'll see some very similar complaints.  Verizon is \"retiring\" it for a reason (according to a Verizon sales rep).You've been warned.

The phone allows decent \"smart phone\" action, and if I hadn't had the luxury of the Galazy III before this one, I might think it's a good smart phone.  It doesn't allow all the Facebook capabilities that I was used to; the camera is okay...but not nearly as clear.  My phone often gets locked up and takes a while to progress to the next or previous screen.  The keyboard, which normally works from top to bottom...or turned on its side, often (at least once a week) gives me an error message and no longer works on its side...(I have to do a hard shut down to get it back).  As other reviews have mentioned, the battery life is NOT impressive.  If I don't use it very much through the day, it will last until bedtime, but if I text...or especially if I make a phone call or two, then it doesn't make it till the end of my workday (5pm).Overall, it's fine.

Absolutely worthless piece of crap. This is the last LG phone I will ever buy. I went through all 3 versions of the LG Envy and hated them all because of how glitchy they were (despite the liars at verizon telling me over and over that LG has fixed them). I'm not surprised that LG has continued this tradition in it's 4G line of garbage.If you do a google search for \"LG Revolution reviews\" you'll find the majority of LG revolution owners, like me, want to throw their phone in a lake.Aside from a general lag in ANYTHING that you try to do on this phone, expect these additional glitches to occur on a regular basis:- Pictures that you take or load on your phone may or may not be saved on the phone....they may also just randomly disappear.- Need to dial \"911\" because of an emergency? Well you had better use someone else's phone then because simply switching to the \"emergency mode\" when you press the send button will cause the phone to crash and shut down completely. Hopefully you have time to restart the phone once or twice before the person dies.- Battery life? Well, if you want to pay an extra $60 on the extended battery pack, you MIGHT just be able to make it through a full day's use....unless you want to make phone calls or do anything else on the phone, in which case you better keep a charger with you at all times. Stock battery was dead after about 1 hr of listening to music....pathetic.- Answering calls becomes a fun game of furiously tapping the \"answer\" button until it recognizes that you might want to actually use the phone for more than just a paperweight.- Texting is a blast thanks to the keyboard that randomly decides it's tired now and would like to disappear for a bit.There's more glitches, but you get the point. Add onto this that the phone comes pre-packed with (give or take) 40 apps that can't be deleted and are completely useless for me. The sound is terrible when trying to watch something on the screen as the speaker is on the back of the phone and distorts terribly at anything over half volume.Now, before you go and tell me that there's probably patches or an updated version of the OS that fixes these problems....there's not. I'm on my 3rd warranty phone because the new one I bought was worse yet on the glitches, and the first warranty phone verizon sent me had a broken SD card holder. I've taken the one I have currently into the verizon store and had the software updated while they attempted to pressure me into buying a new phone and endless accessories for my existing phone.

The second phone would randomly shut off, was extremely slow and they screen would go totally black when i was on a call, so I could basically use it only to talk until the call was over and then i would have to take the battery out and re boot the phone.  Im on my third model now (thanks to certain Verizon terms, if i want to upgrade to a different model I have to pay full price) and its a combination of all of these issues, minus the screen going black during calls.  However, this current model will often get \"stuck\" when im rotating the phone (such as turning it to look length wise at a photo or map) and will stay that way until I re boot. Sometimes it doesnt ring when Im getting a call and goes straight to voicemail.  The camera on this phone leaves a lot to be desired and all in all, there just isnt anything great about it.

I run multiple email accounts off of this phone and I cannot use it, for security reasons, if every email pops up on the main screen every time an email arrives for everyone to see.  Second, this phone does not support Hotmail.  The emails in Hotmail will still send and receive, but all formatting is lost.  All previous emails in a string are simply rolled up into one big and confusing block of text that contains all information in a normal email such as to, from, title, text, but all just crunched together in one big block of text.  Our IT department could not fix the problem, and my boss eventually asked me not to send him any more emails from my phone, which defeats the purpose of the phone.  One last problem is that you cannot change a setting and remove the advertising line that says \"this email was sent from blah blah smart phone\", which is really ironic since the quality of the emails is so poor that I wouldn't advertise if I was them!!!
