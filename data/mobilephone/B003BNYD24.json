She really loves fuschia color, and when i saw that you were selling one in this color, i had no doubt in buying it.  As i live in other country, i wrote a delivery adrees in the U.S., bacause i was going there at the time the phone arrived.  But for my surprise, when i got the phone, it was red and not fuschia.  Iam very disappointed because i order 2 blackberry phones, one in red, for my son`s birthday; and the other one in fuschia for my daughter`s birthday.  Now i have two red phones and my daughter saying to me that she doesn`t like that color because it is for boys.My surprise was ruined, and my daughter is really sad because the most incredible gift for her was supouse to be a blackberry in fuschia.As i only spent 3 days in the U.S. i couldn`t return the secong red blackberry.Sorry for spelling mistakes, but i am from Ecuador, South AmericaKatiuska", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "BLACBERRYS OPINION", "Author": "MAYRA HERNANDEZ", "ReviewID": "R2AW91EII1QAIW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Dissatisfied, NO ONE CAME AS THE PRODUCT IS AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE, NOT FUSCHIA, VinoTinto COLOR IS ALL AND IS IN THE CABINET.
