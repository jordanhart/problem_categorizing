I did a lot or research before buying this phone, it was shipped and arrived on time and worked perfect right out of the box.  I bought this phone because it was unlocked and had a 1 yr warranty, I live in Asia.  I was looking at more expensive phones like the iphone4, Samsung Galaxy, Moto Droid but this phone had all the features but a much lower price.  The only bad points I found in all the reviews was the quality of the screen, speed of the processor and short battery life.  The screen is good enough, the processor is fast enough and yes the battery life is short 2-3 days but it depends how hard you use it.  I found that turning it off at night gives me a extra day.  The phone is easy to use and set up, the touch keys work great, gmail was a breeze, camera is good enough at 5 megapix and with flash too, love all the app's and apple like features.  The GPS was just Ok but the problem in Thailand is the poor coverage by Google, not the phone!  The owners manuel is online because it's 188 pages and you'll need to keep that pdf file handy to learn all the great features this phone has.  It's my first HTC and I am impressed.  This is a great phone with all the bells and whistles of the more expensive phones, well worth the price! Oh and one more thing, you'll love the flashlight feature.Update Nov 2011: Over One Year Later and I still love this phone, works perfect!!!Update Jan 2013: Over two years and yep, still a great phone works perfect,...", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Internet wont work", "Author": "Jessa L. Dolan \"Jessa\"", "ReviewID": "R39ZP7HTM5YELZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like others, I did a lot of research about this phone before purchasing. At first, I didnt want to spend over $200 on a phone but when it came down to it, this phone is worth all the money and then some. I have never owned a smart phone before, so getting use to it took some time...But after a few days of fiddling with it, I figured it out pretty easily. The phone worked great out of the box, all I had to do was insert my sim card and it worked. However, when I went to add internet service to the phone, it did not work, after talking to T-mobile 3 times, they instructed me to call HTC to try and figure out the problem, HTC said when they unlocked the phone, they disabled the internet capability and that I would need to take it to a repair shop and have them lock it to T-mobile. I decided not to spend my time or money locking my phone hoping the internet would work, so I took the web plan off my account. The wi-fi works well enough for me, but I could see this to be a problem for others. I love the phone enough not to care. One main reason I bought the phone was the 5mp camera, which works awesome, the screen looks great to me and have no problem with the battery, I love the standard headphone jack because I use the phone as an mp3 player in my car, the speaker works great, no need for a bluetooth. I wasnt too thrilled with the keyboard but I downloaded a slide it keyboard and it works great. All in all, I am very happy with my phone, except for the whole internet problem.T-Mobile, USAPros:camerascreenandroidstandard headphone jackeasy to navigateWIFIUSB cordCons:problem with it being unlocked (no internet capability)information received in box was not in EnglishCharger is Europe prongs (came with an adapter) buy an extra us version on amazon....", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome smartphone", "Author": "Eduardo J.

I must divulge I had an iPhone 3G before, which may affect my rating.Out of the box I think this phone looks and feels good and has a nice (small) size. The touch screen works well. It has a reasonable battery life, although I have been running low on battery most afternoons. The phone comes with about 2 Gigs of memory, which is waaayyy not enough. How come a $200 phone comes with only this much memory? The camera is OK, but only with good light. The flash is pathetic and can't do more than about 2 feet.Much of the next part of the review really is about Droid than the phone.I was surprised that the phone does not sync with my iMac. I had to download apps to do that and the whole process was a bit of a battle. I then left my phone to sync with my computer overnight and found in the morning that the battery was dead. It didn't charge on the USB port, which I still think is odd. The power cord is hard to get in and the phone is so small you end up switching it on and entering data on the touchscreen unintentionally. And why does it turn itself on while charging and not turn off or screen save after a little while?I do NOT like the interface at all. I am constantly cursing at the screen as the interface just is not intuitive. It took me several days to figure out how everything works, since settings menus are all over the place. The visual voicemail from T-mobile is useless, as voicemails either never make it to this app or several hours later. Typing is OK. I use Swype, which I think is a really elegant input method.Some of the interface badness is:Add an event in the calendar and you don't see the time/date for the event, as the keyboard covers most of the screen. You can scroll the screen down, but it's awkward. I usually dismiss the keyboard so I can see the entire entry screen. You can't do special repetitions for events, just daily, weekday, weekly, monthly or yearly. You can't copy events either, so if you need an event every Mon, Wed, Fri for instance you have to create 3 separate ones.Searching for a contact is only by name. So if I only remember the company name I'm stuck.I seem to be entering or swyping the wrong words all the time, much more than I was used to on my iPhone. I now very carefully have to check my typing.Most of the time the weather info is not available, even though I have good reception, 3G and wifi.The news app never displays news, only stuff from weeks ago, never mind the settings.The only contacts that sync with Google are the ones that I put in myself, not any of the ones I imported by syncing my Mac. Why?There's more, but you get the gist. 5 years ago this phone would have been cool, now it's just clunky. For $200 there is a phone out there that actually works out of the box. It's called the iPhone and I'm getting one soon.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$129.99", "Features": "In the box:   - HTC Wildfire - Stereo Headset  - Battery   - Home Charger   - Data Cable (microUSB)   - 2GB microSD card   - Accessory booklet\nOperating System/Platform -AndroidTM 2.1 (\u00c9clair) with HTC SenseTM\nNetwork -GSM: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz -HSDPA/WCDMA: 900/2100 MHz (Europe/Asia)\nCPU -528 MHZ Qualcomm MSM7225\nDisplay -240 x 320 pixels/3.2\" -Touch Sensitive(Capacitive) -TFT", "Name": "HTC PC49100 Wildfire - Android Smartphone Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ruy3GFd0L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004055HL8"}}
