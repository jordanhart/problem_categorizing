The littlest phone that sits perfectly in my hand eliminating any aches from carpal tunnel,,. Fits almost invisible in my pocket or bra for that matter. It does everything a regular android can do. I would of loved a 8pixel but I know now I'm just pushing it. I'm thrilled when clients, friend, and just random people ask \" is that a phone?\" I just had to put my tmoble chip and I don't need a contract and if Sony comes out with a new mini in 2013 or later I'm sure I'll  buy that one too. Be sure to keep your system clean, and do updates.

It was working fine for a while, but then I went to Europe in June. Phone started playing up, constantly clicking and no way to switch it off but to take out the battery. Commands were unresponsive and flicking all over the screen. Just could not phone as the icon would disappear before I managed to press it.My husband reset it for me and still no improvement. I had to buy a new phone while away from home.Back in the US, phone still not working, still clicking all the time - waiting for Amazon to speak to retailer to accept it back.  Waste of money for me, and I paid over $200 for it.  Very disappointing.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Okay but many software problems", "Author": "Adroit", "ReviewID": "R12UI7VNMEXS97", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this phone for my mom for its simplicity. After two weeks of use, the software kept hanging up. Haptic feedback went wrong and phone kept vibrating continuously. After another week, mom tried the video player for the first time and the phone completely hanged. Re-started but the same problem kept repeating. Software & Hardware link isn't great. Simple phone of course but why use a $190 phone for only talk and text.Good looking unit though. Very responsive and soft navigation without any lag.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "I like this phone", "Author": "L. Lew \"old techie\"", "ReviewID": "R31DPCGT1N5J7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I'm not a kid whose parents pay the monthly bill and I don't call people to tell them it's raining. No, I use the phone when I need it. I finally dumped my NOKIA E71 because after a number of years I still couldn't figure out the Symbian OS. I wanted a good phone for my AT&T; Pay as you Go plan. So first AT&T; no longer allows data to move from a phone account. Must buy a data plan. OK I do and it works fine. Today I get a message from them that if I want a data plan I'll have to first triple my monthly payment and only then will they be so kind as to allow me a data plan (cost additional of course). So I guess it's WiFi for me. Oh, the phone. Well, it's Android and a good deal more sensible than Symbian and there are plenty of apps out there that don't have to go through iTunes. The phone is great! Small, good screen and sound. Unfortunately, you'll need a SIM card from a GSM carrier because it's not compatible with CDMA (Verizon et al).Even knowing how slimy AT&T; is I'd still buy the ST15a again.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cool Little Phone", "Author": "Robin", "ReviewID": "R29PRS1FNYD3JQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a blackberry and wanted to change it out for a small phone that had full android functionality.  This was a great choice for all the features I wanted....Wireless, Touchscreen, Google Apps. Built-in Radio....  The sound quality is amazing.  It has pretty much everything the much more expensive, and sought after Samsung models have, but in a very compact size and for a fraction of the price.  The only thing I wish I could change is to give it a larger internal memory for the built-in apps.  However, I have a 16 GB microSD card for my music and pictures and have just purchased a 32 GB card to replace that one.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Pedro Borges", "ReviewID": "R1FXGBNNQZ266H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this phone.

Unfortunately the phone began malfunctioning after the first month of use. The phone *overheats* and goes into a loop of non-stop vibrating. The only way to resolve temporarily is to take the battery out and let it cool or put it in the freezer for a few minutes. Sony Ericsson designed a beautiful phone, BUT it has a serious defect that so far they seem to be ignoring based on posts at their website and on numerous other websites.

That was a fantastic phone but I did not need the extra bulk of the keyboard. The display is much better with the new version with high pixel density, so the on screen keyboard is much more usable hence no need for the flip out keyboard. Battery life is decent, but you need to turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, Data or GPS when not using them, otherwise by the end of the day you will need a recharge. Just upgraded to Android ICS, that was a very easy upgrade using the SE program on my computer. It is slicker with the new software.The physical size of the phone is the biggest plus, but obviously that makes it more difficult to play games or read books ( more difficult but not impossible). Reading/ writing emails and text messages is easily done even on the small screen, but may need a bit of getting used to if you are coming from a bigger phone.Buy this phone if you need a very small form factor. It also does garner a lot of attention from even the iPhone people!", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really good phone", "Author": "David Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R29AY4L52QKWV3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This a really good phone, good quality/price ratio. An Android phone with a 1GHz processor, that was exactly what I was looking for, a fast phone! I was looking for at least the Gingerbread version of Android and this phone more than doubled the internal memory of my previous nexus one phone, which is a great advantage for installing more apps.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "Isaac", "ReviewID": "R3S95JHHD1NVIH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has everything I need in such a small phone, at first I thought that the keyboard would be an issue for the screen size but I don't have any complains about it, actually there's no problem at all. I was able to update it to Android 4.0.4, and I'm really happy with it, 1Ghz processor, 420 Gb of internal memory and  512 Mb of RAM. The games works really well because of the 192 pixel density(which is great for the size and price). 5Mp Camera and HD video recording. I recomend that if you gonna buy it, buy it with a SD card of 16 or 32Gb cause the 2Gb of the external memory card that the phone brings is not enough. And the only thing that I don't like is the low battery life but I have some tricks to preserve it more, when you play turn off the wifi and 3G, block the screen when not using or also you can put it in energy saving mode but you have to update the phone to a recent version first or download an aplication in the android market especialy for the battery. And for last at first I did not like the interface that comes with the phone but I fixed it with Go Launcher Ex that you can download with the android market as well. It is an exellent phone, Hope you like it too :).", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Jose", "ReviewID": "RT268UVYBCZSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought 2 phones, 1 was with the problem of the overheating thing but i waited for the ICS OS update and it fixed the recalibration problem, now the 2 phones work pretty well, im so happy with the phones, they are nice for people searching for an economic smarthphone with some nice performance, i recommend it so much.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy for begginers", "Author": "Mr. ES", "ReviewID": "RR1XE6GLMVBHM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I`m very happy with the purchase, since it has more features than I expected and very easy to use.
