It is a pretty good and reliable phone. I prefer this by far over the Blackberry. The only major problem I have so far with the iPhone 3gs is the battery life. I don't usually run many applications or do much downloading on a regular basis, but I have to charge the phone every single night. Ughhh! There is suppose to be a pin like object to open the simcard slot, that pin was pissing and one other problem, which is a defect with this particular phone, is that there seems to be some heated pixels to the top right-hand corner of the screen. Whenever i take pictures etc, the picture has this black dis-colouration about the size of a penny on it. That is the major disappointment with this phone, because it is suppose to be a BRAND NEW phone! Other than that and the battery life its a great phone.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone have problem inside...", "Author": "Bacho", "ReviewID": "R17PBNDEV94GUX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have bought refurbished one and visual of that phone is normal.

You can not imagine how disappointed he was when he realized he can not install his favorite apps, because his phone is stuck on iOS4.2.7 and can not upgrade.
