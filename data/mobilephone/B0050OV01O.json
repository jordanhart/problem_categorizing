I need not have worried as the update to Gingerbread was already downloading over the air almost as soon as I had switched on the phone.Delivery was preternaturally fast, and the phone works out of the box with my t-mobile prepaid sim.  I am able to order their pay as you go daily web pass for data usage via t-mobile's m.web2go.com/myaccount/ page on the phone's browser.I have tried out various smartphones and the nexus one seems to equal or exceed those phones' capabilities.  My impression is that the only problem that kept the original 'google phone' from becoming wildly popular was the high price for an unsubsidized, unlocked device.  The price now 18 months after the nexus one's launch is phenomenal, considering the phone you are getting for that price.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "check its problems before buying it.", "Author": "A.

Unfortunately, at twenty months it began to randomly go into a reboot loop, and become very warm at the bottom under the battery door. HTC support recommended exporting my contacts and then a factory reboot. Did that, without re-installing any of my apps, and the random reboot loops and overheating continued. The phone was undependable/unusable and out of warranty. The expense of sending it back to HTC and being without a phone for an undetermined time period was enough to make me decide to pull the SIM card and purchase another new unlocked phone (the Samsung Nexus S, which is even better than the Google Nexus One).", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not that bad.", "Author": "Harsh Aggarwal \"Harsh\"", "ReviewID": "R2I8DATX765I99", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Does someone have trouble with power button, it is uneasy to use.

AFter all, this is/was the 'Google Phone.'No real complaints overall, the phone's snappy and does everything I'd like it to do - after several hours of research I wasn't able to find coherent and reliable instructions re: how to unlock the bootloader and subsequently root it (really wanted to run CM7, but got cockblocked by HTC for the moment, esp. after upgrading to 2.3.4 - much more involved to root, from what I gather) but I'm adapting well to Android after abandoning my iPhone 4.  Paired this with an Otterbox Commuter case for $16 making my total investment in the Android platform around two-seventy-five buckaroos - would've loved to have a Nexus S, Galaxy II, Evo, etc. but this was what my budget could handle in an unlocked service provider format for the moment.

I'm using it to make VoIP calls over Wi-Fi without a cell phone plan, using Google Talk and Google Voice (knitted together by the GrooVe IP app).Unlike others, however, my phone arrived with a non-standard Android 2.2 build.  I suspect it was overstock from a carrier; but whatever the reason, the OS' build id was not listed by Google, and the phone was not receiving over-the-air updates from Google.Due to a Wi-Fi bug in Android 2.2 that caused the phone to lose Wi-Fi connectivity when the screen shuts off, I couldn't use the phone as I wanted until I got a software update -- so I had to go through the process of rooting it and installing an official 2.2.1 build myself, which is not for the faint of heart.The seller contacted me and explained that \"unlocked\" in this context means ONLY that the phone can be used with a SIM card on multiple GSM carriers.  It does NOT mean that the phone's bootloader is unlocked.  Unlocking the bootloader was necessary, on my unit, to install a standard Android build and receive over-the-air updates from Google.  Unlocking the bootloader also voids the warranty (though this was not an issue for me, since the phone was out of warranty anyway).The phone now works perfectly and is receiving updates from Google.

The FCC number on the phone that I received is for T-Mobile. You will only be able to use Edge(2G) from AT&T;, and only receive 3G if you are a T-Mobile customer. False advertising. Luckily I will be leaving my AT&T; contract soon.The other thing that needs to be pointed out, is that these models are the NEWER models which DO NOT use the superior AMOLED technology. It uses Super LCD (SLCD) instead, which is a dying technology. I was very disappointed to learn this, because my previous phone was an AMOLED, and it's difficult to go back to ordinary LCD. The display is still fantastic, but will not have the better power usage, low heat emissions, and the extremely high contrast ratio that AMOLED technology provides. The only benefit to SLCS over AMOLED is that it's easier to see out doors.Everything else about the phone is perfect.
