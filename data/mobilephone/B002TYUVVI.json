It looks great, it is sleek and simple to use, and for a very cheap price compared to similar Windows Mobile phones.I needed a new phone, and even though i'm a designer, I'm not into iPhones, that everybody has, and which I find to bulky and too gimmicky (i dont need that my icons fly or fade or whatever, i just want them to bring me to what I need). I wanted a good looking phone that is quick, easy to understand, and that you can backup.The features I use the most are : phone (yes!), sms, contacts, album, file explorer, camera.I almost never use it to read mp3s or videos, but the demo video looks very good.I disabled the TouchFlo because I found the clock too big, and I wanted to show the calendar with several appointments (TouchFlo allows only one) -- so I went back to the \"old\" Today screen, but there are many ways to customise it.So if you are fan d'iPhone, you will not be impressed by the Touch 2,BUT if you want something between the Blackberry (very business oriented) and the iPhone (more a toy than a phone), then the HTC will be perfect for you!", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Milton F.

Sound is clear.CONS:For this price, this \"smart\" phone is not that smart. The screen is way too small to make it functional. The web brousing is horrible. Without having used an Android phone I'd say this windows operating system is garbage.You'll need to use the little pointer that this comes with because your fingers will be useless on the touch screen.Mine came with some large bulky two part plug in adapter charger - the multi-colored parts don't look like they belong together.Battery life is terrible. Plan on keeping it hooked up to the charger or you computer most of the time. Or get a better battery.In order to listen to the radio you must have the headphones plugged in as they act as an antenna.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent product and awful delivering (More 10 days on expedited)", "Author": "Felix Montero \"Felix\"", "ReviewID": "R1UO6PWGI0CR38", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is an excellent product with excellent and better windows 6.5 beatiful color on it. The delivering quite awful. I had already paid over $30 for shipping and it was more than 10 days. So I do not have any idea about the standar shipping system, but be careful if you are looking for fast delivering time.I am an international worker and it fix almost any international sim cards without any problem on it. Windows 6.5 has almost the same aproach of 6.1 ver. but better respond and better features on it. In general an excellent product for the money that you spend on it.Four start for the quality and nice lookingawful shipping  for such a small box.", "Date": "December 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "HTC Touch2 T3333 GSM SmartPhone Unlocked with Windows Mobile 6.5, Wi-Fi, and Touch Screen--", "Author": "Grizzly440", "ReviewID": "RR44DKHC7H6QY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the first little bit, it was fine... Now its not so good.The Bad:1. Windows is very resource intensive, It slows the phone down.2. The Messaging window randomly pops up3.

It wouldn't be so bad if it would just default to landscape for the web, but this phone stays portrait for everything (from what I could tell).  At ~$300, I'm not quite sure how I could recommend this unlocked price over a carrier subsidized one that had an accelerometer and/or a slightly bigger screen.
