{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Delightful Dual Sim Phone", "Author": "Lionel B.", "ReviewID": "R10UY6XLO7M9UQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this dual sim Galaxy Y Duos ($178) after using the single sim SAMSUNG Y GALAXY S-5360 ($125) for a couple of weeks.Pros:- Dual sim works flawlessly. Both sims are always on and the Samsung software to manage the sim cards is very easy to master.  By pulling down the top curtain you can easily switch which sim is the primarily and thereby choose which sim to call/text from. Also, from the sim setting you can quickly decide which sim should be used for data or turn off the data completely. The dual-sim phone is excellent for frequent travelers that need to handle multiple sims cards without the burden of multiple phones. Also works well for those that want to separate work and private lines without having to carry two phones.- Android 2.3 Gingerbread (have not heard of any update to ICS 4.x)- Full functioning Google play market for apps.- SD slot that takes up to 32 gb (I am using it with 8gb)- Wifi and bluetooth- Tethering and Wi-Fi hotstpot- Very good battery life. The phone will easily take you through the day with average use.Neutral: (Updated 11/17/2012)- Okay specs for a budget dual sim phone. Has 832MHz CPU and 3.15MP Camera- Okay screen resolution 320 x 480 Pixels. Screen is responsive to scrolling.- Good call quality.- Adobe Flash - had to sideload flash on mine but recent phones now reporting flash support)Cons:- Screen size is 3.14 ins which is a bit small. (I think the barest minimum for a smartphone should be 3.5 inch in order to browse and read easily)- No front-facing camera for video conferencing- No camera flash- No WiFi Direct.Overall, a delightful entry dual sim android phone by a reputable company for under $200. This is definitely a much better phone than the single sim SAMSUNG Y GALAXY S-5360. If there may be the slightest reason to use a dual sim then I would suggest you invest in this one over the single sim galaxy y.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works great, including Square credit card readers", "Author": "Randy - Furniture Medic", "ReviewID": "R2PDX7U8M0WPN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to set up the phone rather easily, in spite of the minimal instructions. I have a T-Mobile SIM with unlimited talk, text, and data in slot 1, and a T-Mobile prepaid SIM in slot 2. I have a mobile business that covers two telephone area codes, and I used to carry two phones. Now I only need one phone for both numbers.An additional reason for getting the new phone was to get an Android phone that I could set up a Square credit card account on. The Square card reader works great. Customers can sign the transaction right on the touch screen, and get a receipt by email. I love it, as this should enhance my business, while simplifying my life.The phone came with an adapter to plug European/Asian charger cords into US style outlets, but the charger itself was correct for US outlets.I just wish more instructional info came with the phone.Update 7/11/12: This phone has much better reception than my Blackberry. Today I was in an area where my Blackberry would never find any service, yet this phone was receiving emails and a phone call. Battery life is excellent. I could probably go a full two days with this, while my Blackberry was lucky to last a day.I get a little frustrated with it at times, as many times when I swipe the screen to unlock it, different apps will open, depending on where I swipe.I totally impressed a customer with it yesterday, as I used it to swipe her credit card and immediately email a receipt to her.I do wish it would have a flash for the camera, as I often take photos of customer items.Overall, I am happy with it.Update 7/30/12 - Yesterday when I turned the phone on, it could not read the SD card, and asked if I wanted to reformat it. I waited until I got home, and my laptop could not read the SD card either. My laptop would not reformat the SD card, but the phone would. I loaded most of my stuff back onto the SD card, and it has been fine today.However, in trying to use the Navigation app today, it kept asking me to install the voice speech synthesizer, even while it was telling me directions! I am loading it now, and it is being installed on my SD card. So even though speech is installed on the phone, it wants another version on the SD card, and maybe I lost that when the SD card crashed. Now that the install is done, the Navigation app is happy.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great For BASIC Texting and Data Roaming", "Author": "jrp", "ReviewID": "R4VMEEEZDHKKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this primarily for texting and prepaid calling.  Superb value if texting and prepaid calling are all you care about. Having dual SIM/Dual Stand-by, both SIMs work AT THE SAME TIME.  One SIM can use the 3G technology while the other is on 2G (texting, data transmissions) - but both are ACTIVELY running.  You can turn OFF either one IF you want to use just the OTHER one.Being sold already UNLOCKED, I was able to use my both my EUROPEAN SIM as well as my ASIAN SIM.  While international roaming text is CHEAPER than international calling for my instant communication in the field (as well as VOIP, email and the likes where you have to wait 'till they power up and their PC and log-on to their email accounts), I was able to knock down costs for important messages needing urgent responses.If you are the person who needs state-of-the-art technologies in data, picture, sound, internet and WIFI connectivity, this product may not be best for you.  But if you are simply on basic communication without bells and whistles yet able to get your job done at a modest cost and flexible multiple SIM carrier swappability, then this one's can't be beat!Other tools I love most on this are:  touch-screen texting with multiple line visibility, text threads are in \"ballons\" with SIM1 or 2 desgination, \"swype\" texting, wide screen and very light to carry.I also purchased two more extra batteries (EB464358VU @ 1300mAh) and one universal charger because I really am a text-ing fanatic!!!!", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great dual sim phone with some shortcomings", "Author": "Paris Velardo", "ReviewID": "R37T9D02YABBJ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone in Europe through Amazon and as always fantastic service and very fast delivery. I had high hope for the phone and it has performed well. I will list all the pros and cons with brief explanations:Pros: Works as a dual sim, very easy to switch between 1 and 2 sim card. Worked great in different parts of Europe and works well in US.Very good build quality, sturdy and nice feel. Touch screen is very good and responsive for this price category.Good battery life while running a few apps: Gps, bluetooth, active screen saver etc.Nice camera although no flash, again for the price its very good.Reception and call quality, speakerphone, and earpiece very good.Internet access also very good, better when connected through Wifi.All around a very nice user friendly phone at a great price.Now for the shortcomings:If you plan on using the MP3 function and just happen to be on of the \"few\" windows media users, forget it. It will not ready wma files. You either have to convert them form your laptop/cpu or buy a program that does it. I was truly disappointed in this matter because I have 10 year old Nokia phones that will play the WMA files and sound great. Was Samsung too cheap to just incorporated a wma program reader?On that note; if you do decide to upgrade and get a program that will convert the files, the sound quality, through headphones is LOUSY. At first I though it may have been the headphones but, I tested the headphones and even connected Reference AKG's, still sucked. I guess I just have been spoiled by Sony and NOkia MP3 players.Also even if you do purchase the Apps to convert you files you still can't use them as ring tones. I tried over ten different apps and only POwer Amp worked, purchase at Google.Thus anything with music, forget about it. Just keep using your old MP# player.I know a few will say its a phone and not a music player but, in this day and age with the technology out there to have ten year old units outperform is truly sad.Camera is good as I mentioned but, no flash so pics aren't as good and the camera function-zoom is a bit unusual.Memory: only 170mb; Not bad but, if you download apps and they can't be moved to sd card it will slow you phone downAll in all a very good phone for the money. Samsung would have received 5 stars had they just spent a bit more on the MP3 player, better camera functions and expanded memory.The perfect phone would have been the Galaxy W model with a dual sim function and a decent MP3.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Functional and reliable, but no reason to buy when Sony is the same price", "Author": "M. Williams \"FrequentFlierGuy\"", "ReviewID": "R2BNNN2X1GST6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Basic conclusions for the three phones discussed below, as well as some travel tips:Sony Xperia Tipo Dual-SIM ST21A2 ($129)- nicest screen and camera, has dual SIMs.  If you need dual SIMs, this is by far the best phone for the money that I found.  The charger handles both US and European voltages for charging, but it only came with US plug, so need a European plug adaptor (should be $5 or less).LG LG P350 Optimus Me ($89)- Basic, reliable phone. about 1/3 cheaper than the Sony and Samsung models I looked at.  The LG phone was the only one that came with an adaptor for both US and European (not UK) electrical outlets.Samsung Samsung Galaxy Y Duos S6102 ($127)- No reason to buy this phone.  Similarly priced Sony phone was superior in every way. The charger handles both US and European voltages for charging, but it only came with US plug, so need a European plug adaptor (should be $5 or less).In a nutshell, these are small form factor smart phones (think palm of your hand) that use old (but inexpensive) technology to deliver very basic smartphone performance (not good for games). The main upside for the Sony phone turned out to be better screen resolution and brightness and a better camera than similar price/size phones.  The other advantage is that it is sold directly by Amazon, which means more reliable shipping times and very little chance of getting a knock-off, or used or refurb phone that wasn't properly disclosed.I purchased three different \"smart phones\" for a recent family trip to France (Paris and Nice, and some side trips), and I will compare them here.  They were the Sony Xperia Tipo Dual-SIM ST21A2 Phone (about $129), a Samsung Galaxy Y Duos S6102 ($127), and LG P350 Optimus Me ($89).All are unlocked GSM quad band phones, which is what you need for pre-paid service in Europe (LTE smart phones are still expensive, so not part of this discussion).  For a tourist, pre-paid service is the cheapest route, and you don't get any unexpected charges.  Using your US phone with an \"international\" plan is really expensive in my experience, especially for data.I wanted basic smartphone functionality, which included wifi, GPS, email, texting, and voice.  Didn't really care about the camera and wasn't willing to pay up for a phone to play games on (can use your US phone with Wifi for that anyway).  I have looked at the cheaper voice only or legacy feature phones, but they aren't that inexpensive (usually $30-$50) and seem to have reliability issues for the really cheap ones. Plus, if you think about how you are likely use a phone in a foreign country, being able to pull up a maps screen and pinpoint your location and find nearby food, medical, etc is a huge benefit. Also, for texting I wanted a keyboard, not a legacy phone keypad.All three phones performed their tasks reliably and competently.  The GPS is especially helpful when you are overseas and don't speak the langauge.  The GPS also efficiently integrated with Google Maps on all three phones, which meant I could use the full Google search engine to find restaurants or store places (useful if you switch phones and log in under your Google ID).One difference among the three phones was that the Sony and Samsung were dual SIM, while the LG was single SIM.  The SIM card is what lets you use a particular carrier's service and provides your phone's phone number, etc.  Having dual sim cards would let you switch between carriers without opening your phone, removing the battery, and also keeps you from losing the other sim card when you aren't using it.  I just used one sim card per phone on this trip, but if you were driving though different countries in Europe or wanted a separate data provider, you might want to have dual sim cards.If I didn't need dual SIM cards, I would just go with the LG phone b/c it had all the functionality I needed at the lowest cost.  The Sony phone is much nicer, though.  The Samsung phone was basically identical to the LG phone in terms of functionality, but it had an extra SIM slot.Also, battery life was great on all three phones.  When out and about, I typically turn WiFi off so the phone doesn't waste battery looking for wifi, so this helps.  But I run GPS pretty much the whole day.  I also set the screen to turn off on the shortest possible interval.  Doing this I got about two days of use (a lot of texting, emailing, moderate maps use, not a lot of voice usage) out of a single charge.  If you use a tone of battery, all three phones have a removable battery, so you could order an extra and keep it with you, but I don't see that as a huge problem.A note on signing up for service:I did try ordering a SIM from Orange from Amazon before I left.  This was a waste of time and much more expensive than doing it in France at an Orange store (I know b/c I went to the Orange store in Paris).  The Amazon SIM was $29.99 and included about five Euro of benefit- i.e. you are paying $25 for the physical SIM card, and then you have to go online and sign up for a calling plan.If you visit one of the many Orange (or another carrier's) stores in France, here is what I paid- For twenty Euro I got a SIM card with unlimited voice and texting for the month plus 150 mb of data and a five Euro credit.  I also paid ten Euro for an extra 500mb of data.  So for 30 Euro, I got unlimited voice and texting, plus a five Euro credit and 650mb of data during my stay.Also, rate for using your cell to call to the US was 0.09 Euro cents per minute, so the five Euro credit gave you almost an hour of calling back to the states.  The phone data plans do not allow you to use cellular data for skype, but you can use wifi to skype.To recap- buying a SIM card in the US- $29 and you get only a five Euro credit.buying the SIM card in France- 30 Euro and you get a five Euro credit plus unlimited voice, texting, and 650mb of data.If you must have a working phone when you land, you should order the SIM in the US and get it set up before you leave, but if you can wait until you check in to your hotel and then go to the Orange store it is a much better deal.  Also, I never found any SIM vending machines at the Paris airport (CDG), though I see them all the time at Heathrow.One more note- if you use an android phone, when you set it up, make sure you disable automatic and background refreshes (unless you really want them :-)  I went through 500mb of data in two weeks because of Android refreshes, and that was with WiFi on in my condo (I do self catering lodging in Europe).If you visit the Orange store in France, make sure you walk through the process of how to \"refill\" your phone's plan in case you need to buy data.  You basically enter #123 on the phone, then follow some menus in French and enter your code.  But there are no English menus, so if you want to be self-sufficient, get them to show you at the store.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very practical and handy phone", "Author": "Eldho Thomas", "ReviewID": "R1GQGL45F6HM8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it mainly because of the dual-sim card feature and the Samsung reputation.

I live in one country and work in another so I needed a dual sim phone. This phone is very compact but does support two full size sim cards (not micro sim). It has input for the google store so you can download apps and it has all the other features one would need in a smart phone.It's nice and small - I don't want a huge 5\" phone screen and this one serves the purpose perfectly. The resolution on the screen is okay...but definitely not as good as a ipad/iphone or other smart phones. If you're planning to watch movies on your phone maybe get something else but for a youtube video now and again this phone works fine.SOME IMPORTANT DETAILS -Volume - the in call volume isn't as loud as other phones I've had and the speakerphone isn't great either. It does great in most scenarios but in a noisy car on the freeway it can be hard to hear.Memory - This phone has a tiny amount of memory so if you want to install a bunch of apps make sure to get a sim card. If you want to install big apps on the phone you're in trouble but I'll tell you how to get around that.# 1 - Root your phone - this will allow you to do lots of cool stuff# 2 - Get a big SD card. I got a 32GB card and it works well with this phone# 3 - I installed a program called link2SD so I can make my apps always save on my SD card..not on my phone memory. This allows me to add about 500% more apps to this phone than you could do stock. There are some tutorials online on how to do this.#4 - The screen resolution means many google store games and apps may not be available for your phone (they will block you from downloading the app) - there are ways to make google store think you have a different phone and make an app work on this phone but many will not.Switching between sim cards is easy and I can get 3G in the US which you cannot do with many of the other dual sim phones from china, etc.Overall I'm happy with the little phone. As a dude I always feel silly with a huge tablet phone or anything larger than a iphone. This phone is small and fits in my pocket easily.

The order and delivery process from Amazon was flawless. But the phone itself has an inherent problem in that it comes with a lot of (in my mind \"junk\") software from Google and Samsung that cannot be removed. The result in my case was that after downloading two additional Apps (What's App and Facebook) the phone essentially became useless as I kept getting notifications that my memory was full and e-mails could not be downloaded. FYI:  I did buy a 32 GB SD card and installed it, but most applications need to run on the phone itself so it has become unclear to me what the purpose of this SD card may be, aside from maybe video clips etc. Eventully I removed these applications again and now have a few MB that allow for e-mail downloads (forget about opening attachments).I now limp along using this phone, but probably will end up buying another phone that can accommodate SIM cards that has much better memory capacity.Maybe this issue is related to the fact that it is an older phone type and as such has poor memory capacity that is no longer compatible with modern Apps that require a lot more memory. If that is the case, it should not be sold anymore. But of course there may be quantities of this phone sitting in inventory somewhere and Amazon can unload them by offering it cheaply (I paid about $100  -  would have gladly paid more if it only worked better).", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "No memory for aps & bloatware cannot be removed", "Author": "T.

After I installed a few (JUST A FEW) of my most commonly used applications, I was in for a shock.I had installed one game, an app to access my bank, a flashlight app, and Google's own navigation when I began getting notifications that system memory was too low.  What?  I had installed a 16 gig memory card when I bought this thing, how could I possibly be out of memory?Here's how.  This phone only comes with 1086 (1 meg) of its own internal memory and the BLOATWARE (lots of Google apps and other things) that comes with it eats up most of that.  The apps that you download, whether they are installed on a memory card or not, will need to eat into that system memory to run their own processes at times.  Before you know it, you will receive regular, irritating beeps telling you that the phone is out of memory and unable to even receive text messages for you...you have to uninstall some apps to make room.Here's the kicker:  You CAN'T uninstall any of the (useless) apps that come with the phone.  Not without rooting it, and I'm not in the mood for that.

Five days out of the box, this phone has the same look/feel as my old phone, but it makes great use of the newer technology.  The touchscreen is tough, yet responsive.  The Android OS is a lot more intuitive than than the somewhat awkward combination of WinMobile/Touchflow on my old phone.  The dual sim works great with my Straight Talk and China Mobile accounts simultaneously.  Straight Talk worked instantly, but I had to leave the phone on for about 16 hrs to get on the China Mobile network - I think that this was from all of the network 'handshaking', as China Mobile with international roaming in the US uses the T-Mobile network.Addressing some of the problems from the other reviews.  The screen is small (3.14\"), but I see it as a plus.  I just don't like the feeling of carrying around a big, heavy phone all day.  Also, internal storage is quite small (512MB) and the data feels a bit slow, but these seem to be endemic of most smaller phones.The only thing I didn't like was there wasn't an easy way to hang up, at first.

Shaffer", "ReviewID": "R4CGA5YNGE8NO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this phone so far.  Perfect form factor for my trip to Germany in a few days, also works great here in the U.S. due to quad-band GSM frequencies (EDGE/2G).  I also know I will love the convenience of having two SIM card slots so I can purchase one in Germany for use while there and not have to keep track of my U.S. SIM outside of the phone.  No hassle when landing back in the States to let my loved ones know I'm back is great!My only caveat for potential buyers is that I didn't receive the model listed here.  I received the S6102B version of the phone.  The only difference between the S6102 and S6102B is the GSM frequencies for HSDPA/3G.  The phone I received has 850/2100, whereas the version listed here has 900/2100.  This makes a big difference if you are planning on using a 3G network operating on the 900MHz frequency (not used in the U.S. but is used in other countries).  I'm actually quite happy that I received the S6102B version because it means that I can use 3G in the U.S. AND in Germany (not using it in the U.S. currently but enjoy the fact I could in the future).I'm using a T-Mobile SIM that was a breeze to get from their store, plus unlimited talk/text/data for just $2 a day.  They unfortunately use the 1900MHz frequency for their 3G for now (AT&T; uses 850MHz), but since I just need the phone for the day I leave and the day I land it isn't a huge deal to me to be stuck on EDGE data speeds.  The phone immediately synced with their APN settings and I was testing it out the minute I walked out of the store.UPDATE 2/12/13:After using this phone in Germany, I wanted to post a follow-up.  I'm still extremely happy with my purchase.  I was able to get a German SIM card and add it along-side my U.S. SIM.  The settings for telling the phone which SIM to use seemed adequate (though you can't disable BOTH of them, one must be active at all times).  You can also determine if you want to still accept incoming calls on both SIMs or just one or the other.I was not able to test 3G while in Germany, I only had EDGE coverage either because of the plan I got, the carrier I got my SIM card through, or for some other reason.  I'd like to test this out further the next time I go overseas to determine if it is a problem with the phone/frequencies it supports or not, but the EDGE data coverage was excellent albeit slow.  However, I was able to use Maps and Gmail with no issues, which were the most important things.I loved the fact I could simply press a few buttons once I landed back in the U.S. and I was calling people to let them know I was back safe WITHOUT having to open up the phone and swap SIM cards, which also meant I didn't need to keep track of a tiny SIM card while over there either, it stayed safe in my phone the whole time.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problems, problems", "Author": "Dave Murphy", "ReviewID": "R7Y6OI13LJWLV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone itself is good, but there were many problems.

I am currently unable to install a required system update (the first system update I get, actually), because there is no space on its internal memory. I had to remove everything I could, and I still barely have space to run multiple apps in parallel. (apps occasionally eat some local storage, as well)- reacts very slowly, sometimes the screen freezes, probably also because of the poor processor and/or lack of internal storage memory.- Most annoying thing: sometimes the SIM cards (one or both) stop working, i.e. you cannot receive or place calls, you cannot send or write SMS, although the phone indicates you have signal. You solve this by rebooting the phone, and it doesn't open very often, but it's annoying because you can miss important phone calls or messages, without even realizing that your phone has not been working properly for the past 6 hours. (there is no visual clue that something doesn't work, until you actually try to place a phone call or send a text message).- the camera is very limited, has no flash, it has poor usability (no ability to see the picture immediately after you have taken it, no ability to rotate the picture, etc.)On the plus side:- it's a lot smaller than other smartphones- the battery lasts longer compared to other higher-end smartphones.- you don't have to carry two phones, and you can switch easily between the SIM cards from the interface.- physically (from a hardware perspective), the phone feels more robust.

I found myself constantly trying to increase the volume whether on a phone call or when listening to music etc. Usually, I am the one turning down the volume, so it does not seem to be related to my hearing.- Touchscreen is not so responsive/accurate. I was constantly missing the target or lagging. I noticed this on another Samsung Android phone as well. Maybe this is due to the lack of RAM/processor power. This can be overcome in part by being much more conscious while interacting with the touchscreen.- Could not get the built-in mail client to work with my IMAP mail account. I could receive mail but never send. Never had this issue with any device before. I assume I could have changed mail clients, but the standard client should work well enough, at least. On another note, reading mail on the device was actually sort of bad, compared to the built-in iOS mail client; it felt a bit like a throwback to Windows Mobile Phone 6 (shudder!) Don't know if these are Samsung-specific or general Android issues.On the good side:- Battery life was exceptional. Very good.- In the US (on AT&T;) this phone will only use EDGE (may be the reason for good battery life). This didn't bother me as I only need email on the go.- Micro SD card slot accessible without removing battery. I added a 32GB Micro SD card, that's a lot of music/podcasts for travel.- I bought iCloud integration software from google Play Store (less than $5).

However, I did need to ask another Samsung user to help me figure out how to delete messages. (By the way, I don't like that I have to press six times to delete one message!) I also miss all the sound wav options for call and message alerts, plus alarms that my Nokia had. But compared to the cheap Tecno phone I was lent after losing my Nokia, this phone is great. I have to remember it's all relative.The Korean-made phone has four language options: English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean.

Samsung does not have an upgrade to android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich for this phone. so you are stuck with gingerbread if you don't root the phone and upgrade that way. this is something that i am thinking about. as the phone is entry level, the on-board memory is not that big. u can save apps to sd card(up to 32Gb micro SD) but the apps that need to be on the system memory when installed will deplete your space. however, there is a way to save all apps to sd card. there is no zoom on the camera. so u have to be close for a closeup(no pun intended). some apps does work properly since they require better screen resolution and or processor.WHAT I LIKEthe touch-screen is very responsive. no complaints here. android os works fine and is reasonably easy to learn. picture and video quality is also fine. i have no drop-calls like i read in some other reviews and the 3G and 2G work fine. 3G is on sim one and 2G on sim two. the phone is dual-sim which allows me send calls to friends and family of their networks without accruing additional interconnection cost.  the phone can use a 32GB micro SD card. this is good for storing plenty of apps.CONCLUSIONthe phone is nice for entry level. it has a good feel to it does the job.UPDATE 2013/01/30i have been experiencing loss of network signal(data network signal) at least 3-4 times a week. this is annoying. i'm not sure if it is the phone or the network but i have read reviews stating it drop calls. however, it still operates well otherwise.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything I wanted", "Author": "Joyce A.

In fact, I am so happy with this phone I'm looking to replace my regular home phone with another Samsung product.The phone is nice and small, very easy to use.When I first got the phone the instructions were only in Spanish (no worries, the manuals are online on Samsung's site). I did have an issue that the phone would not full turn off. I only had to do one factory reset in the first week and so far it's been working like a charm. The screen can be a little too sensitive, but you can work around that. Now I like my phones nice and simple, I don't do as much as other people (watch movies, listen to music, etc). For those people this phone might be too basic for those who want the kitchen sink.I look forward to using this again on my trip to Germany and feel confident that it will still work like a charm. So far, I'm extremely happy with my purchase.UPDATE 3/31/14 :-note the phone worked perfectly on my Germany tripI've had this phone for some time and it's still going strong. I just wanted to give an update on this phone.I originally bought this phone only for business/vacations and ended up using as my main phone.1) SD cards crash on this phone frequently. I bought cheap SDs, expensive SDs, SDs of this class, SD of that class, etc. It seems to happen regularly, just be prepared.2) Memory for the phone is limiting. Even with an expanded SD card, I've had to go through the phone every once and a while and dump a lot of stuff just to receive text messages. It always seems to happen when you don't have time to do all of the cleaning out!3) This is on an old operating system, so it's a tad slow. I've been using it as my every day phone and I'm going to have to upgrade this year. My lifestyle has changed and I need a phone with more bells and whistles now. It's still a good phone if you want something simple. As the price drops more this would be the perfect phone for a group/family trip where you need to keep in touch with members of your group regularly.4) Not having flash or auto focus on the camera bites.
