She was in dire need of another one and I did my research to find a nice, easy to use phone for her, considering that she was elderly. The phone has a textured surface, but when flipped, has very big buttons for calling. Perfect for her! I programmed it all for her and it works well - clear voice calling, but we did not test out text messaging, since she has no use for that. Overall, it's a very nice looking phone for the older generation and she was completely satisfied with it. Therefore, I am as well!", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "I really like my new flip phone Samsung GT-C3520", "Author": "MrT", "ReviewID": "R31NJHQ55W2RBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to be in the high tech industry for years but never got crazy about smartphones.  All in all, I like the Samsung GT-C3520 for its simplicity and good quality calls.  I want a reliable phone (no butt call) that I can carry around in my daily (and often messy) activities where dropping the phone happens too often and where the phone gets in contact with metal (nails/screws) and dirt in my pockets. When my friends join me, they often end up leaving their smartphones in their cars or in my house.  Now no doubt that when we travel, I'm glad that my wife has a smartphone with a GPS and the ability to browse.  However, on a daily basis, the GT-C3520 is all I need.I purchased this phone to replace another flip phone that was slowly failing to charge.  I have a basic pay as you go plan with T-Mobile and after swapping the SIM card, the Samsung GT-C3520 was up and running making calls and sending SMS on the T-Mobile network.A few days later, I flew to France and purchased a new SIM from Orange SFR. The phone being unlocked, I was able to get on the SFR network and get/receive calls/SMS.  I was told that the SIM card would only work in France.  However, on my way back from Europe, I was even able to get a few SMS to the US from the Amsterdam airport (2 hours layover before getting back the US).Back in the US, I'm again using my Samsung with T-Mobile.  I got it to work with my Subaru outback using the Bluetooth capabilities.  It is great to now be able to talk in the car (pretty rare) without holding the phone.  The sound quality is really good.Finally, since I had a 1 GB Micro SD card, I popped it into the GT-C3520.  The card was immediately recognized (as expected).  I now have my favorite music with me for the rare cases when I drive alone.The only thing that I'm missing with this phone is a calculator.  Maybe I did not see it yet or maybe I can download a calculator later.  Something to investigate...", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to use phone for: Seniors, Children and Tweens--readon for more details...", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "RIB87UOGVWPS5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone was purchased for a child's first cellphone. This somewhat rugged cellphone is a great find for today, the day of the touchphones! Who in the world would want a easy to use flip phone? Note that the comments you may find helpful and feel free to ask me any questions as I am a techie...1) A young child that wants a first cellphone just to text on, make phone calls, listen to FM Radio or listen to MP3 songs! This phone is so so easy to set up and use. This is for someone who just needs to make phone calls sometimes and does NOT need to get on the Internet (data). It does NOT have WiFi in this phone. But it can be set up with APN settings to use data if you have a data plan with AT&T;, T-Mobile etc.2) Seniors who want a \"Phone, Phone\" with no bells and whistles that is easy to set up and use! This is a carefree, no fancy stuff type of phone. If you just want the basics in a phone: Flip phone style, MP3 (music player), camera, FM Radio, this is the phone for you.3)People who want the basic type of phone that you can use for PrePaid minutes or GoPhone minutes with ANY GSM provider with no contract such as AT&T;, T-Mobile, Simple Mobile, etc. I would advice one of these as they just need to be added to once a year:Both AT&T; and T-Mobile offer prepaid minutes of 1,000 minutes good for ONE YEAR for just $100 per year--this is just 10 cents per minute for phone calls with NO CONTRACT! As far as costs for text messages, AT&T; charges 20 cents to receive and 25 cents to send (Ouch), these come out of your minutes balance. T-Mobile is cheaper for texts, they just charge 10 cents to receive and I think it is 20 cents to send.When you get the YEARLY PREPAID of just $100 with either AT&T; or T-Mobile, this is the CHEAPEST way to go if you do not need lots of minutes and the cost is LESS THAN $10 per month.Thank you for reading this review, if you have any questions, please ask in the comments and I will be happy to answer all questions...", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung GT-C3520", "Author": "Glenn P.

Good news first: it works and it is reasonably simple for him to handle and loud enough for him to hear.

You are expected to navigate through the menus to change the volume and it's nowhere near simple.Then there is the price. I mean, in the age of marginally decent sub-$100 Android smartphones (with WiFi et al.), what does a \"feature phone\" offer to command a price of $70?!Overall, however, if you want a simple (that is, simple in basic features as long as you don't touch the Byzantine UI) yet reliable phone and can live with the price, then this phone is a good choice.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little phone that makes me want to have a flip phone again!", "Author": "R. Maung", "ReviewID": "R1H9FM1UE7ZVLR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this for my parents who travel and live between two countries and since it's so hard to get a hold of them, I thought an unlocked mobile phone with some internet functions will help. This is simple enough for those who don't use technology too much. But it has all these preloaded apps including Facebook and emails, chat, etc.of course, you can browse web too. However, I have yet to try these apps and see how they work as I only purchased a basic international SIM card with no data plan and low credit. I did try calling my own cell phone using this SIM card and the phone worked. The camera is OK. Good for this type of phone but don't expect a smartphone standard because this is not a smartphone. Camera isn't bad at all. I took pictures of my kids and my nephews so my parents can look at their grandchildren while away, and the images turned out great! Menu isn't as intuitive but if you've used a flip phone or old generation cell phones before smartphones came out, you will know how to navigate it easily. It's light, and its body is made of plastic (as most phones are, really...except for a few Motorola phones I've came across) so it does make me wonder about what will happen if it's dropped. But it fits so well in the hand so I doubt it'll fall out. Note, I do have small hands, and so do my parents.I have not used it outside of USA, even when I tested the international SIM card so I don't know how it works outside the country, but if it allows calls from mY international SIM card, it definitely is unlocked, so I'm assuming all other SIM cards from other countries will work as well. It is so cute and user friendly that I wish I can keep it but I got myself another smartphone that's unlocked my own travels, and have an AT&T; GoPhone (which is a flip phone with lesser functions than this phone) and my own regular AT&T; smartphone for use in here at home in USA.

We haven't gone overseas yet so I cannot comment on whether it meets those needs, but as it is unlocked, quadband and GSM, it should be just fine.  I like a flip phone and there are not many options anymore.  My previous phone had exterior buttons and I disconnected calls while trying to answer them by bumping those buttons - this one has none of those.  It has no exterior view screen, but it can be set to require a button push to answer, so opening it to see who is calling does not connect the call (screening calls).  I don't need a large selection of features.  I guess this one can do data, but I don't do data on my phone so I can't review that.  I can hear on this phone better than my previous phone which is one of the reasons that I started using it right away.  It is slim and lightweight.  The screen is easy to read and buttons easy to push.

It took me a while to realize the problem since I use the phone infrequently and only when traveling. People told me the call quality was poor and that there was a loud rustling noise but I thought it was just poor reception or from using the phone outside. I finally tested it calling my own landline and realized the problem. Unfortunately, this was after two months, so I could no longer return through Amazon. Global Mobile says I can send it to their German site for repair. I'm looking into what the postage would be and whether it is worth it. Probably not given the other limitations of the phone.  Otherwise, the phone is OK with a couple of drawbacks. The main one is that the boot process takes quite a long time. So if you keep it turned off most of the time, as I do, it takes a while before it is usable - much longer boot than a cheap $20 BLU Jenny phone I have, which overall is as good or better as a phone (though the Jenny lacks an audio jack) . Also, the quality of the photos is really poor indoors. (Not a shock for a fairly cheap phone, but in case this is important to you).  In the end I'll probably be out the $68 I paid.
