{"Reviews": [{"Title": "What all satphones strive to be.", "Author": "Nukedude \"Travelling Techie\"", "ReviewID": "RAEP0F2CWRHZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the satphone that made them popular. The Motorola 9505A satphone has been out for a while, but is still a very capable unit. Recently replaced by the 9555A model. This unit I rated higher than the Globalstar GSP-1600 due to being more ruggedly built and the Iridium satellite network is more developed. I have used one of these for the past 7 years on several continents. Like most, it can also be used on a cellular network if provisioned for it. Rubber armor covers the exterior, and it is hard to break these things. I have only seen one out of about 75-80 units I have personally used be defective or damaged. (Globalstar GSP-1600's on the other hand tend to get smashed or cracked cases.) Hardware and accessories are more expensive, but you get your money's worth with this unit. Night vision compatible screen, external antenna options and ability to use a computer in data mode makes this the unit to have. To get e-mail or external antennas, you will need to buy the accessories. Iridium has been used by the government and is very reliable. I have never had a failed call or dropped call on this network. The only option I have never liked is the leather sleeve style holster these come with. Get a molle nylon holster for this and use it like a large cell phone. Great unit to have if you venture away from civilization or respond to emergencies. This unit will make 911 calls without service being activated. (Just be sure to actually use it for an emergency in that case.)", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Worldwide Satellite Phone\nSatellite telephony, Voicemail\nSMS messaging\nCompact, light and water-resistant", "Name": "Iridium 9505A Satellite Phone (Standard Package)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518XSEryNFL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000S2AVBS"}}
