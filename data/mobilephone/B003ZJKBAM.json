One thing that threw me off was that unlike an iphone or a droid, you actually have to press the screen as if it were a button.  The phone also didn't come with a charger, but luckily I had one.  Other than that the phone works great! I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new phone!! :)", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "it's okay", "Author": "eric", "ReviewID": "R3C0LJU8L9VSJW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Thanks, it was expected that the product works very well, everything is complete as they promised, thank you very much", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "NICE PHONE!", "Author": "evobigtwin", "ReviewID": "R2WHF4CVOHQD4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WAS LOOKING FOR A REPLACEMENT FOR MY SAMSUNG DROID CHARGE, THAT WOULDN'T DIAL OUT ANYMORE AFTER ONLY LIKE 15 MONTHS OF USE!--INSTEAD OF A WARRANTY CLAIM I WENT BACK TO THE BLACKBERRY PHONE-- THIS PHONE IS GREAT FOR WHAT I NEEDED-- TALK,TEXT AND EMAILS-- IT WILL PULL UP A WEB PAGE BUT NOT AS FAST AS MY DROID CHARGE, BUT I HAVE A TABLET AND LAPTOP FOR THAT-- THE NEW PUSH BUTTON SCREEN IS AWESOME IF YOUR USED TO A SLIDE SCREEN SMART PHONE-- I AM HAPPY WITH MY BLACKBERRY FOR ABOUT THE SAME COST AS A WARRANTY REFURBISHED REPLACEMENT I GOT A BRAND NEW PHONE!--GREAT DEAL AND PHONE FOR ME--I AM HAPPY WITH MY NEW PHONE!", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst phone ever!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RWSKDZB29M9EC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Please, don't buy this phone! It's slow, battery doesn't hold charge for more than 2 hours, the screen comes loose, it's heavy and the response for the touch screen is just terrible!! I threw this thing away after a week, it's irritating. My advice: get any other phone, the Blackberry Storm is NOT worth it.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent care and very good quality", "Author": "Yadiry Yamile Contreras Ram\u00edrez", "ReviewID": "RUZ6B8CWADZTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excelente atencion y muy buena calidad, de producto muy buen servicio y puntualidad de entrega, buenos precios y buena explicacion del producto al momento de ver las publicaciones", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "buena compra", "Author": "leonel ulichny", "ReviewID": "R27HPI31VCWXD5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "buena compra aunque me ofrecieron con memoria externa y no llego al igual el protector de pantalla, al igual estaba bloqueada solo para telefon\u00eda verizon", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Blackberry storm", "Author": "NaNee", "ReviewID": "R32M6PTBIXEUML", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Product arrived on time...however I sent it back as this phone sucks battery juice way too fast.
