In the future, I will definately purchase more on Amazon. Although there was some trouble at the beginning with my carrier being able to connect my new phone and I was also sent the wrong sim card for it at the beginning from sprint, finally all is well and I truly enjoy using my photon.

The Virtual Keyboard is spacious and easy to use. I bought this phone USED and it came to me in perfect condition. I am currently using it through Sprint's service. I had no problems connecting it with Sprint. Keep in mind, i've had this phone for only a couple days, but i have had absolutely ZERO problems with it. Un telefono muy bueno. It has a moderately good battery life. It lasts me the whole day. Great call quality, and the speakers sound loud and clean. The 8mp (megapixel) camera is splendid, and i find the HD video capture even better. It shipped quickly. I completely recommend this phone to any customer contemplating buying it.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Battery Problem.", "Author": "Mahir", "ReviewID": "R3BYJ0SUW18TXL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After using 1 year there's gonna b some battery problems.After two years u will have to take a charger with u whereever u  go so that u dont run out of charge.That is a big problem if u plan to use it for a while.", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I didn't know any better", "Author": "EmperorWatcher \"pak.hanafi\"", "ReviewID": "R7TSW17FAVWK8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "What a disaster. Don't think twice.. If you MUST have this phone, just buy another battery and external charger Immediately! It's a power hog.Be AWARE.. Motorola WILL NOT upgrade the operating system of this phone. They said they would, but then, when can you ever trust Google (you know they own Motorola, right?). OK.. It does have a terrific camera. 8MP and the picture quality is superb.. but I really need the PHONE quality to be terrific even more than the camera quality, know what I mean?Seriously. Try a Samsung phone for ease of use and reliability. If you ever touch another Motorola, I'll be amazed.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "It was worth the wait...", "Author": "Semper Fi Phil \"Philip A.

But it is faulty. I've had it since the beginning of the year and almost every single day it has restarted... sometimes up to ten times per day ( randomly). To make matters worse it usually does this in the middle of a call. This is very frustrating because it takes forever to reboot. I do not recommend this phone to anyone until Moto/sprint finds a fix for this problem. It seem to be a Motorola problem...because i had an Atrix and it did the same thing. not as much though. I've seen many forums where other photon owners had the same problems as mine. Do the research your self..if they find a fix,this would be the perfect phone..:(..get a samsung.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R182KDRGEUUZ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have like almost 2 months with this phone and I love it, it's a great phone.The only thing I found annoying is that sometimes not always, the phone restarts it self, and some of this times is when I'm making a phone call.
