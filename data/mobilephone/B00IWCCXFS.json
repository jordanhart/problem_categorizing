Does what ii is intended to do", "Author": "L. Caprara", "ReviewID": "RRY7C0V8VL4ZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this phone to be a spare for either emergencies or for visitors that come from abroad and do not have a local cell phone/number. I've put a AT&T; pre-paid (Go Phone) and it was recognized right away and it is working well so far. Made a few calls to test it, and they were loud and clear as expected - regular calls and also using the speaker. I did not test the earpiece for phone calls, but I can do it later and update the review.Connection with my home wifi was set with no problem, although I noticed that it took a little longer to establish the connection (like 30-45 seconds). But ever since, I've been using/testing web surf, youtube, e-mails, and they all worked perfectly.I was surprised by the battery life.. I've charged for a few hours (since the battery came already charged at +80%) and let it be to see how long it would last. That was 3 days ago. It is now at 56% !! Maybe it is because I did not use it that much for calls (and the AT&T; signal strength here is at the highest level) and the wifi signal is also high... anyway I was positively surprised by it. Let's wait and see after a few months how that turns out.I think the only downside of it is the earpiece: does not provide a great sound experience, and if you plug other phones (I've tried with my other Iphone original and general brands as well) the sound is low and not good at all. I did see same reports for this issue with other BLU phones. Maybe something that needs to be improved in future models.I've ran the ANTUTU benchmark on this phone and it came out as 10604 (Poor CPU; other items as general), which is higher than another phone I have (Samsung Galaxy S II) that is also outdated, but still working fine. My Galaxy S ii was rated by ANTUTU benchmark as 10454 (same details as the BLU).Final conclusion: great phone for U$ 99.99 !!", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this phone.", "Author": "agnes cork", "ReviewID": "R3PX9292PMRB5G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my cousin and she loves it..
