I am having some issues with apps, new SD card, 'porting' old phone number, etc. nothing major.IMPORTANT NOTE: I went to WalMart.com where there is everything you could ever want to know about this phone, and I recommend getting this AT your WalMar store IF AT ALL POSSIBLE! It's ONLY $149 at WM, plus you will need to buy the $45 monthly UNLIMITED card which they have aplenty at the WM stores. I was lucky enough to get the LAST Proclaim they had, but you can check your store first or order it on the website. \"Customer Service\" from Straight Talk blows, but if you think you can manage without it, this is an awesome deal!!", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "As good as advertised", "Author": "PatrickMH", "ReviewID": "R1S683O695U22G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my Proclaim for well over a year. I recently thought about updating to the Centura and bought a used one. That phone, though equipped with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), was a total piece of junk. Here's why the Proclaim is head and shoulders above the Centura: you can directly interface with the microSD card. The Proclaim allows the user to store apps on an SD card, move music, pictures and video from hard drive to the card as well. Android 2.3 is adequate for the basic user. As far as the complaints about Straight Talk's limited Unlimited plan, one must read the fine print but they do let you know. Only data that is used with programs or apps pre-loaded on the phone are unlimited. In other words, one could watch Youtube until the cows come home and never have speed throttled down. Should one acquire the Netflix app, yes, you would likely lose your speed after a few days of usage as that app did not come pre-loaded on the phone.As far as he complaints about battery life, isn't this the major complaint for ALL smart and iPhones?  Look, the more apps you have, the more your battery has to work. Most apps don't shut off when the user backs out of them and so they continue to draw power. Get a task manager app or utilize the built in widget to monitor apps that need to be killed and you'll be ok. Additionally, the displays eat up most of the battery life but this can be monitored and adjusted by the user. The phone has 5 home screens but again, if you load them all with apps, it will likely slow the phone down and drain battery life. I'm operating with 2 homescreens and this seems to be enough. Keep it simple. Additionally, I have bought two backup batteries that I try and take with me when I'm traveling or unable to charge the phone. batteries are not as expensive as I thought (I bought two off of Ebay for less than 20 bucks).The phone can receive wi-fi signals and uses less battery power when doing so. 3G connectivity is necessary for certain functions like GPS. I'm not sure why. The USB charger is ok and you can download Airdroid to allow your phone to engage in wireless interface with your PC or laptop.I can play Temple Run 2 on my phone but need to be mindful not to have other apps running simultaneously because this creates lag during the game. Contacts can be imported from email accounts, Facebook etc. If you keep contacts backed up on your SD card you can import or export them.The alarm clock function works fine. I think the calendar function is quite useful. One can sync their corporate email and the phone can be adjusted to require a password and lockout times.No issues EVER with calls being dropped. However, with certain contacts, my phone doesn't seem to ring when they call me and so I end up missing calls. No big deal. Again, the Straight Talk Unlimited Plan is $45. Even if it's not unlimited, it's still better than a contract.Overall, I think the interface is quite intuitive and the phone doesn't require much time to become used to operating it effectively. The phone comes with all of the Google apps including Google Play Music. Some of the Google apps arent quite so good. I really like the GPS feature and use it all the time. it has never steered me wrong. The phone also is equipped with Bluetooth and you can share music with this feature.Android 2.3 is not compatible with Google's Chrome app. So that sucks if you like that broswer but I was able to use opera-mini.Also, the face is equipped with Gorilla Glass. I have dropped my phone on many hard surfaces and the glass is still intact. Admittedly, it has 2 very small cracks but these do not seem to have grown bigger. The speaker is not that great but with the right headphones compensates for it.Now, I bought this phone immediately after it was released. It cost me $179 bucks. Currently, Straight Talk is offering the Galaxy Proclaim at $99. Keep in mind that this is the same price as the Centura. Buy the Proclaim. It's a great phone and does exactly as it says. Simple to use, reliable and fits in your pocket. I recommend it to everyone I know. If you like the additional perks that contract phones provide and don't mind the ridiculous monthly dues that go along with it, then stay with your contract. If you're willing to give up some ofthe luxury for a solid entry level Android, then this is the phone for you. It's a CDMA phone and utilizes Verizon's humongous network.

This phone required charging at least twice a day under light use. I'm a teacher and work all day, so it's not as though I spend my whole day on the phone (the same can't be said of some students). I listen to music on the way in to work for about 45 minutes and charge it the whole way. I get home and may use it to check facebook, send a few texts and make a couple calls. On average, I probably spend less than a half hour per day calling. No matter what shortly after I get back home the phone is DEAD.-The charger: charger does not seem to work very well. At one point I tried using the phone as a GPS while plugged in. Upon arriving at my destination, I unplugged the phone, only to have it inform me that it had low batter life (it didn't BEFORE I plugged it in!).SUMMARY/TLDR: The phone is inexpensive and has some nice features. It works well if you can charge it almost full time-the battery life is extremely short-lived).I ended up buying a Huawei Ascend Y instead. I get far better battery life and was able to purchase a 32gb microSD card to go with it and still save money.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "UNLIMITED IS NOT UNLIMITED - READ THIS FIRST !", "Author": "Howard \"K. Howard\"", "ReviewID": "R2H678HP4WSMCZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After I read this consumer alert, no way will I use Strait-Talk. Read and decide for yourself.Buyer BewareA good number of Straight Talk customers reported to Newsbeat Epicenter a variety of horror stories in conjunction with this cellular company. So Newsbeat Epicenter ordered the Samsung Glaxy Proclaim/Gingerbread 2.3 and the Samsung Galaxy Precedent Gingerbread 2.3 to experiment with. First of all the Android 2.3 is pretty amazing plus there are over 600,000 apps you may be interested in with many of them free of charge and others mighty low cost.However, unboxed, these Straight Talk handsets claim unlimited talk, text and data. As it turns out the talk and text have been unlimited with the Unlimited $45 load card. However, during our experiment our data slowed down to nearly nothing on both handsets in 3 week period of time. And when our techs called Straight Talk they claimed we used too much data so they drastically cut our speed way down. Straight Talk provided that the data is not at all unlimited as they claim. Well they refused to give us back our surfing speed and we were told we would not get back to normal until we renewsed our so-called \"Unlimited\" service the next month. So we did renew and our surfing speed went back to normal for a few hours then both handsets were deactivated because we used too much data. The one handset was reactivated yet we were warned about data abuse. The other handset was locked down entirely and we were told that phone could never be activated again by Straight Talk nor any other cellular company. By the way they charged us $53.08 yet deactivated our service about 12 hours later. We are seeking a chargeback of that money but have not received it as of yet. And we will not be receiving our money back for the expensive handset they locked down.So buyer beware!

I wanted to stay with Verizon because they have the best coverage and never had dropped calls the 10 years I was with them. Then I found that stepping up to a smartphone meant that Verizon was going to cost me $90/month for a package deal that included 450 minutes of voice, 500 texts and I forget how much data, but it wasn't a lot. So I started looking around for other carriers, like Virgin Mobile, Cricket, Boost Mobile. The big thing for me was that with those providers you buy the phone and then the service was around $50/month. Much better price than Verizon wanted to charge. The big drawback for me was that the majority of them used the Sprint network which I heard around me was TERRIBLE for coverage. Then a friend of mine mentioned Straight Talk. Unlimited talk text and web for $45/month. So I checked out their website and which carriers they used, again, most of them ran off the Sprint network. But hold on, two of them run off the Verizon network, one of them is the Samsung Proclaim. So I did some research and verified that the Proclaim does indeed use the Verizon network! Unlimted talk, text and web for $45/month? Sign me up.At the time no Walmart by me had them in stock so I had to order it off the website, and I also picked up the 30 days of use card to activate the phone. The phone itself is very nice, this being my first smart phone I figured I'd be a little overwhelmed by it but found it pretty easy to use. I was able to transfer my number from Verizon, activated the 30 day unlimited use card and I  was on my way. Now this is where the problems with the service began. After a few days of use I lost my data connectivity and could not make any calls with it. The phone was on but pretty much useless. I called Straight Talk to find out what the problem was. I was on with customer service for over an hour, having me turn the phone off and on, dialing a certain string of numbers to increase the roaming etc. I got the phone working again and a few days the same problem happened, could not make calls, no data connectivity. This happened 6 times in one month. Every time I would be on the phone for over and hour sorting things out and the agent would tell me that \"this will never happen again\". The very last time it happened I simply told Straight Talk that if it happened one more time, I'd go back to Verizon. And from then on, it has never happened again. Every so often I would get the dreaded \"DATA CONNECTION LOST\" error message but it sorts itself out and within 10 seconds I have the internet connection on the phone again.Now to be fair my uncle decided to take the plunge and buy one of these in January of 2013, even though he knew of the problems I had my first month. Interestingly enough, he bought the same exact model I have, and the same exact plan. He's has not had one problem with it. He lives in Vermont and if you don't have Verizon up there the phone just will not work all that well.So do I recommend Straight Talk? Well yes but you have to remember the first 30 days I had with them were just terrible so you may end up taking them up on their 30 day return policy.Note: I have heard that Straight Talk will kick you off the network if you hog bandwidth. I love to stream audio with this phone and have literally left it on all night and never had any problems.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Could not activate the phone.", "Author": "Dawn Clark", "ReviewID": "RUAEX2J18443D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We should be told that we cannot activate this phone unless we send in a receipt and other paper work.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice, but a bit strange at times.", "Author": "RandyWa", "ReviewID": "RCWD9GUOGJQOJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I would like to say that I do like this phone and would buy it again.

You can also order direct from Straight Talk cheaper with free overnignt shipping.As a smart phone it is OK except for the camera which is slow to respond and has no flash. It has froze up twice while using the camera. Battery life is OK as long as I don't have both 3G and WiFi on at the same time.Annoying features: You get the same tone for texts and emails, and you can't turn one off and leave the other one on. It's both or nothing. Also it beeps to tell you that charging is completed. How many people charge their phone on the nightstand when they sleep? I do. I have not found a way to silence this feature alone, without silencing calls as well.Straight Talk CDMA phones use the Verizon network but coverage is not as good as if you have a Verizon contract because Verizon pays for their contract customers to roam on other CDMA towers. My straight talk phone did not work AT ALL in Alaska last month; in the past I have gone there with a Verizon phone and it worked. Straight Talk customer service told me there are no Verizon towers in Alaska. The did credit me for the 6 days of no service. Verizon plans to start building towers in AK this year.My wife's Straight Talk phone is a GSM phone so it uses ATT network and worked fine in Alaska. But we signed her up for Straight Talk service in a different city. Straight Talk decides which network you can sign up for depending on where you use your phone the most when you sign up. This also determines which phones you can use. On GSM you may be able to use a phone you already have including iPhone, but on CDMA (Verizon) you have to buy a Straight Talk phone.In December I lost my job and turned in my company Blackberry, so had to get a personal phone. This is MUCH better than a Blackberry, no comparison. I wanted an iPhone but couldn't justify the extra cost. I have been a loyal Apple fan since before Apple was cool, but I have to admit it is a real treat to be able to load music on this phone without having to deal with iTunes.Update 5/19/2013 I have been working in Africa for three months and of course this does not work as a phone outside the US. It does work as a wifi Internet device so I can browse the web and email. Also run keeper works here even without wifi and I just wait to download my runs when I have wifi. The first time I used run keeper it took a long time to latch onto the satellites and sometimes now it takes a few minutes but eventually tracks my runs accurately. Whenever I go to the US on leave I just sign up on the Internet for one month Straight Talk, and then activate my phone when the plane lands in Atlanta.

I like the service - I REALLY don't like this phone's version of android. My previous phone was the Blackberry Storm - which I loved. I wanted to get the new BB Z10, but it wasn't worth the premium paid to Verizon. Anyway.... This Proclaim android phone takes 2-3 MORE steps to do simple things. If I want to dial someone, I have to CONFIRM the that I want to dial, EACH TIME. Also, the calendar notifications are quite poor - I use the calendar multi times a day to remind me of just about everything. The phone just has a short list of very short ringing notification sound selections and when they go off, they only show the current time, NOT the calendar listing (which I was used to on Blackberry). That means I have to open the phone (because it's ALWAYS LOCKED), open the calendar, and see which item was notified. I say 'which' because, on the daily calendar view, this version of android lists the recurring items (of which I have several everyday) on a list and the other items in the calendar by time entry. And sometimes I just don't recall which thing was supposed to be noticed - because the 'listed' items don't give the times when they're supposed 'ring'!EVERYTHING on this operating system takes SEVERAL MORE STEPS to do just about any task. I almost bought the iPhone5, but I didn't because of the $650 price tag. The Proclaim is $149 from Walmart. I think I regret it now.I looked at other reviews and you might find the LG Optimus Logic or the Huawei Ascend Y which are in the same price range and functionality a better buy for you. I didn't check all of the listed phones here at Amazon, but I'd check others before purchasing.If I can upgrade the OS, I will try that next.

My exerience with Straight Talk was satisfactory, but nothing to really brag about. My experience with this phone has been great so far!

I can't say the same for T-Mobile, my GSM counterpart I purchased to use on Straight Talk. No, this phone doesn't have a flash on the camera, but if I want pictures that are that much better, I will grab my actual camera! It does have some interesting little features that even my phone didn't have, which I thought was pretty cool, especially since my daughter loves the minor things she can do to personally customize this phone to her liking. All in all, I love the phone and have no complaints about it. I will mention that in looking at Amazon, I would buy directly from Straight Talk or try Ebay.

It was everything I could ask for!  The only thing is that now the system is out-dated(it runs on Gingerbread[Android 2.3]).  But I could download the apps I wanted quickly, check my e-mail, do Facebook, Tango(when I had it), Kik, and pretty much anything else that I needed.  I got a Galaxy Discover later and I wish Samsung had used this as the model for future phones of a similar size.  The chamber for the micro SD card on this is easy access; on the Discover I have to remove the back cover to insert the micro SD card, which is a little annoying, but that's what you have to do on most phones.  If Samsung had used this phone as the model for many of their other phones, I doubt I'd see as many 1 star reviews for some of their other models.  I think if someone rates this phone 1 star, it's because they're either very impatient or very abusive towards these devices, because this is a great device.  It's the PERFECT starter for an Android newcomer.  It's extremely user friendly, fast, and fun.  The only downside for a newcomer would be that it would make them set a high bar for future phones because the Proclaim would create the burden of expectation for their future phones.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Change is not so bad", "Author": "margaret brookins", "ReviewID": "ROFUQLEP4FCDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a person who didn't like change.
