{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best phone out there! Finally on Verizon!", "Author": "The Gun \"raygunjsr\"", "ReviewID": "R2HUBPKTM3B3ZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been waiting for some news on the Verizon version of the HTC One and thankfully it came out just as my upgrade date rolled around. I have owned 8 other smartphones over the past several years and the HTC One is the best that I've used. It is ultra-fast with a very slick interface.I chose the HTC One over the other offerings out there due the quality of the construction and the hardware. I have never liked the Galaxy series, as they feel cheap with their overuse of generic plastic. I have not had good experiences with Motorola hardware. I really liked the HTC Rezound that I had years ago and it's clear that HTC has put a lot of thought and research into the development of the HTC One. It is constructed on par with the iPhone. Clean lines, aluminum frame, it looks great and fits well in the hand.The hardware is blazing fast and I like the Sense software enhancements. I even find Blinkfeed a great collection of news and my social media updates. It would never replace Flipboard for my news reading, but for a quick scroll through everything that's going on, it's very helpful. HTC has gone with clean menus, great fonts that look great on the 1080p screen.I have had zero complaints with the phone. I'm a power user when it comes to smartphones and I have been overwhelmingly impressed by the HTC One. The one thing that continues to astound me is that phone makers don't wake the phone up when you receive a text. Thankfully there's an app, SMSAwake that solves that problem. The camera takes good pictures; I have not seen pictures from any phone (except maybe the new Nokia line) that are better than a decent point and shoot camera, but the HTC One camera will capture the moment just fine and the Zoe camera function is pretty cool.I recommend the HTC One without hesitation. The design is flawless, the hardware is cutting-edge and the software brings it together in a great package.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "The phone that ALMOST did it!", "Author": "Anthony Allen \"};^)~\"", "ReviewID": "R34BXNS8R24EVA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been an HTC user for a LONG time (all the way back to the HTC Herald/T-Mobile Wing Windows 6.1 phone). In front of me on my desk, I currently have four generations of HTC Android devices: The HTC Droid Incredible, the HTC Rezound, , the HTC Droid DNA, and finally, this HTC One all for Verizon. When I first picked up my new phone, I was highly impressed by the feel of it in my hand. It was such a pleasure to hold, that I was very reluctant to put my normal case on it that slides into a holster, but I knew I had reservations about this newest HTC unit so I forced myself to put on the case. First off, the phone is an only marginal upgrade from the DNA in many respects. The One is slimmer and shorter than the DNA (One: 5.41 x 2.69 x 0.37 inches vs DNA: 5.55 x 2.78 x 0.38 inches), but the DNA weighs slightly less (One: 5.04 oz vs DNA: 4.87 oz) With the same overall resolution (1080 x 1920 pixels) the One has a lightly better Pixels per inch (PPI) than the DNA (468 vs 441). I think this is because of the slightly larger screen size of the DNA. While I had to look VERY closely, the screen on the One is slightly sharper, but I prefer the larger real estate of the 5 inch DNA screen over the 4.7 inch One.The One is made of aluminum which stands out to be the sexiest Android phone I've ever seen. It just looks and feels awesome! The slightly newer version of Android (4.2.2) seems to be a step in the right direction, and Sense 5.0 seems to be even smoother than the older Sense, although I've always had an affinity for HTC's Sense GUI. I am pretty annoyed by the Blinkfeed feature on the One that you can't get rid of, although you CAN set another panel as your \"Home Screen\" and tuck the BLinkfeed panel out of sight.The stereo front-facing speakers on the One are one of the other features that REALLY set this phone apart from the others I've used, tested and played with over the years. I was actually able to hear EVERYTHING clearly, even at full volume. OF course, the bass isn't earth-shattering, but at least you can hear that it's there. Watching a movie or TV show was actually enjoyable, and it was much clearer than on the DNA. As with all Beats-by-Dre enabled HTC phones, I was not impressed by this feature on the One and found that it muddied the sound on the stereo speakers.The HTC One also sports a handy infrared remote control feature. The power button on top doubles as an IR remote blaster and the phone can \"learn\" to control many different devices. The stock software is pretty good although it wants you to set up a TV every time, and I only have a projector (Although it did learn most of the functions from that remote). It was still pretty cool. On a side note about HTC power buttons, they sure like to move them around: The original Incredible has the power on the left, the Rezound is on the right, the DNA has it in the middle, and the One brought it back to the left....Now we come to the epic, and I mean EPIC failure of HTC with the One: The camera. I mean, COME ON! 4.0 \"ultrapixels\"???????? This is where I made my final decision to return this handset to Verizon. I take a lot of pictures with my phones, and I just can't get over how HTC made such an awesome phone and then ruined it with some gimmicky camera stuff. The DNA has 8 megapixels vs the 4 \"ultrapixels\" and the DNA takes superior pictures in all conditions. I read many places that the One was awesome at taking indoor pictures in low light and no flash, but my comparisons between the two phones produced better pictures on the DNA. Because of the larger number of pixels, edges were sharper, clearer, and the colors more natural. Sorry HTC, you dropped the ball here.All this aside, if you are looking to come from an older phone and don't ever plan to print an 8X10 photo from a phone picture, the HTC One is the sexiest Android phone on the market. It is very fast, sleek, the screen is second-to-none, and the front facing stereo speakers are the best on any smartphone I've ever played with. However, if taking pictures is a high priority like me, you'll want to either wait and see if HTC fixes this issue or try another phone (if you can find a DNA, they are nice units). My last thought has to do with manufacturing quality control. I've read a lot of complaints about durability of the One, and the unit I have (had) has some slight manufacturing defects where the top piece of the phone (the border around the screen) does not line up very well on the top and the bottom of the phone. There are definite ridges on those bezels....the fit and finish is not world class.HTC One Pros:The aluminum frame makes for a VERY sexy phoneThe Front-Facing Stereo Speakers produce awesome sound for a phoneThe screen resolution and pixel density make for a very nice viewing experienceThe 1700 MHZ Quad-Core and 2GB of RAM make for a snappy phoneHTC Sense 5.0 does appear to be an improvement over earlier versions of SenseBuilt-in IR remote control32 GB Internal StorageDecent Battery (2300 mAh)HTC One Cons:The gimmicky and (to me) useless 4.0 \"Ultrapixel\" cameraFit and finishBlinkfeed that can't go awayThe loss of zooming out the home screen to see all panels at onceNo SD cardNon-Removable batteryDid I mention the camera?HTC One Notables:Beats by Dre is still \"meh\" to meThe included headphones weren't impressive and lacked any Beats brandingIf the camera didn't suck, this would be a 5-star phone hands down.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, but could be better", "Author": "Makoto Schoppert \"makoto\"", "ReviewID": "RMNWFV3WDRDXX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first smart phones were HTC, back in the days of Windows Mobile 5, and my first Android phone has been HTC.  A few years ago, I decided to try out Motorola's Droid RAZR Maxx HD, and then the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 which is my current daily driver.  I decided to see what HTC has been up to and give the their flagship phone, the HTC One, a try.Pros:* The unibody aluminum frame gives it a nice sturdy feel that doesn't feel cheap like plastic bodies do.* The \"ultrapixel\" camera does give it better shots in lower lighting, but then you do trade off megapixels.  If you are just shooting for sharing on social networks, this may not be a big deal but if you plan on printing photos, I'm still not 100% convinced of their strategy of using a lower megapixel camera (albeit bigger pixels).* The HTC widget on the home screen is pretty nice.  Gives you a consolidated view of news and social network status updates.* One of the nicest pros for me is having stereo speakers in the front.  I never understood why smartphone manufacturers decided to put the speakers in the back.* A nice bonus is the IR emitter that can be used to control your TV/DVR/Receiver.  You can view channel listings on your phone and use it as a remote.* Integration with Zoodle's KidMode is nice, especially if you have a toddler that you would like to entertain.--Update 2013-09-13* I just noticed a feature that this HTC phone has, much like my previous HTC phones had, which is built-in support for SIP (used for VoIP calls).  My Samsung devices do not have this built-in and I have to use a third party app. This is useful if you would like to use a SIP provider to make and receive calls.* The Zoe camera mode is pretty neat.  Essentially what it does is it will continuously take video in Zoe mode, but when you press the button to take a picture, it will create a 4 second long video that has 1 second of video prior to when you pressed the shutter, a point in the video of when you pressed the shutter, and 3 seconds after the button was pressed.  You can then create a photo from anywhere within this timeframe.Cons:* When typing, the Home button is right underneath the period, so I've found myself exiting an app a few times while trying to type a period.* I like the buttons on Samsung devices better, which consists of \"Back\", \"Home\" and \"Menu\".  On the HTC One, there are only two, \"Back\" and \"Home\".  Without the \"Menu\" button, apps either have to provide their own menu button, or an extra row is added below the app which is the Menu button and takes away a little bit of real estate from the app.* No SD card expansion* No wireless charging, which I suppose is the tradeoff to having an aluminum body since the aluminum would interfere with the wireless charging.* Included e-mail client does not support S/MIME encryption. On Samsung devices, the built-in e-mail client does support S/MIME encryption however.  Most people may not care or use this feature, but for corporate use, this may be more important.Neutral:* The BeatsAudio enhances music but I wish it was more customizable like an equalizer.* There isn't a built-in flashlight widget/app like there is with Samsung's Assistive lighting widget* Doesn't perform quite as fast as the Galaxy S4, but still runs plenty fast enough, so not marking it as a con.* Camera app doesn't seem to be as full of features like the S4.* I don't like the curved back.  This may appeal to some people but I would actually prefer a flat back.  When I have it laying on my desk and want to use it, I end up making the whole phone wobble back and forth every time I press the screen.* The Ir blaster feature is neat, which essentially allows your device to be a universal remote control.  It downloads TV schedules as well so you can get an idea of what you'd like to watch.  Personally, I haven't found myself using this a lot but this could be handy if you're somewhere, like a waiting room, or in your company break room and would like to change the channel.Overall, I think HTC did a great job of building a nice phone.  With Verizon's lineup of Android phones, HTC faces competition with Samsung's Galaxy S4 and Motorola/Google's Droid series (like the Ultra and the Maxx).  The hardware is really nice (with the exception of buttons in my opinion) but the software is lacking in some places.  Both Samsung and Motorola do a better job of packaging useful software with their devices, whereas this one doesn't.Also, worth noting is that this phone still uses MicroSIM cards and hasn't switched to using NanoSIM cards yet like with some other new phones.  I actually like this since my other phones are using MicroSIM as well and I can switch my SIM card around from one phone to another.  Had this phone switched to NanoSIM, I wouldn't be able to do that.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mostly good, but one bad thing.", "Author": "Robyn Howard \"Robyn\"", "ReviewID": "R26LFWM5K0NSJ8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the HTC One from Best Buy on 11/2/13. I have drooled over this phone for the past 6 months, previously owned a HTC Inspire which performed really well for the last 2 years, and I am a fan of HTC. The HTC One has many great features. The camera, which is something I am picky about, is excellent. The sound with the speakers is really amazing, it does not sound like a cell phone but more like a stereo system. The display is beautiful, clear, and sharp.The in-call sound is good. I'm used to talking with someone on a handsfree bluetooth speaker phone and there used to be so much wind/road noise from their end. No changes on their end, just the switch to the HTC One on my end and they sounded so much better, almost as if they were actually holding the phone rather than speaking to a speakerphone.The battery life is really good. The phone feels super sturdy. The ability to turn it into a TV Remote Control is cool, but also super nice because it lets you know that shows you like are currently on. No more searching for them via a guide.So, why a 3 star rating? Which, it does hurt me to give.When holding the phone with my shoulder, I lose some service, people can't hear me or if the service isn't 4-5 full bars, I lose the call. There is some debate over what causes this, if it's the full aluminium body, if the antenna in the phone just isn't strong enough. Some people say if you're left handed (or like me and just prefer to hold the phone with your left hand) that the bottom left corner of the phone being covered causes it to loose signal. I did experiment with that, it seems to do that especially if signal strength isn't high.Bottom line, I am not pleased with the signal strength...for whatever the reason may be. I love everything about the phone, except that. Which is important in my case. And it may not be an issue for some people, who live in areas with stronger signal strength. It seems to be the case for most service providers though as I saw reports of this from AT&T;, Sprint, and T-Mobile users as well.So, I will be returning mine, somewhat begrudgingly. I am lucky in that my 2nd choice for a phone is available and on sale currently, the LG G2. It was the only other one I felt compared to the HTC One as far as all around good deal.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving it So Far", "Author": "Jim Tressel \"Brandon\"", "ReviewID": "R1GGCJPQ9V030Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me first start out by saying that this is a very early review as I have only had my HTC One for about 3 days. First of all, this has to be one of the best looking phones ever made. I think I decided I'm not going to put a case on it as I usually do with all my smartphones...yeah, it's that good looking.I came from an iPhone 5 which I loved but the small screen was getting to me. I needed something larger and this was a definite improvement over the 4\" iPhone screen. Battery life has been comparable to the iPhone and maybe even slightly better. Android has come a long way since I last used it about a year ago. Things are fast and smooth and there is almost no lag at all on the HTC One. Speakers have amazing sound quality although believe it or not, I was expecting them to be louder at points. I guess it depends on what you are doing, but all in all they are incredible and I don't know if I can go back to normal speakers.Another plus of this phone is that you get 32GB of storage right out of the box compared to the normal 16GB found on the closest competitors (Galaxy S4 and iPhone 5/5S). The screen on this phone is beyond beautiful and the best I've seen on a phone. The colors representation is for sure the best I've seen. The screen is a full 1080p display with over 460 ppi (pixels per inch). This is the biggest ppi ever on a smartphone. There is some controversy over the camera which is a 4 ultrapixel camera. On paper, it may not seem so great but I must say I took one of the best shots I've taken on a camera phone yesterday while outside in sunlight. The picture looked incredible and that is where this camera really shines...outside. There are some pretty neat features as well on the camera such as \"Zoe\" which allows users to take a three second clip instead of just taking a still shot. Let's say you want to take a still shot out of the \"Zoe,\" you can do that! You can always go back and go frame by frame and take out the best shot and the shot you want. Really cool feature!If you are coming from an iPhone and want to jump onto Android, I think the HTC One is the best way to go right now. If you are on Android now and want superb build quality, amazing speakers, and one of the best displays on the market then I'd recommend the HTC One to you as well. Really anyone will at least like this phone I think.Overall: 9/10Pros:-Amazing Build Quality (Best on Android)-Amazing Speaker Quality-Solid Camera and Camera Features-Great Screen Size (4.7\")-Good Battery Life...but could be betterCons:-Practically None-Non-removable Battery (Not a big deal for most)-Can Not Add More Storage (Not a big deal for most)", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I almost made a HUGE mistake", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R9IKZQNW7IHRH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first got this phone I was so impressed with the speed and fluidity.  I had upgraded from the RAZR HD because I was so frustrated with its lag and performance issues.  You can't put that much bloatware on a phone and only give it 1 GB of ram...unless it's intentional of course (the droid ultra is the same as the RAZR HD but w/ the 2GB or ram - less the desired micoSD card slot).  Compared to the RAZR HD, this phone practically knows what I'm going to do before I touch it (in other words, it's REALLY fast).The mistake?  When I first got the phone I could not explain why the battery was draining at a rate of 10-15% per hour in standby mode.  That means that when not using the phone I was barely getting 6-8 hours per charge.  And given the fact that I had a new toy and was using it extensively, it was draining the entire battery in no more than 5 hours.  While I am in the car or office most of the time that was so unacceptable that I started to think my dream phone wasn't practical enough to actually use day-to-day.I tried everything to improve the battery life.  I researched the heck out of it on the net.  I installed battery monitoring programs and tried to kill applications I wasn't actively using.  Finding no solution, I finally called Verizon and asked to exchange the phone for a Droid MAXX.Luckily, before I activated the MAXX, I saw a guy on the street using a ONE and asked him about his battery life.  When I told him about the poor performance I was seeing he told me something must be wrong with the phone because his was phenomenal (way better than his wife's iPhone 5 he said).  Encouraged, I started uninstalling apps one by one (targeting what were probably the most resource intensive first).  Long story short, I eventually isolated the problem as BTSync (an awesome bit torrent file sharing/backup app - a must have IMHO but it's still in beta-ish so it must have been running in the background non-stop).NOW - the battery life is excellent.  I still have two different battery utilities monitoring performance, but I get a full day of moderate/heavy use out of the phone and don't need to charge at all during the day (I charge every night at bed though).  For example - I had the phone on battery for 17 hours now and it still has 30% charge.  I've probably made 2 hours of calls, surfed the web for an hour or two, sent dozens of texts and emails and used google maps for traffic updates during my commute to and from work.  I've also watched over 20 minutes worth of video throughout the day.  Needless to say I gladly sent the MAXX back before ever activating it.PROS:* SPEED & Fluidity (ZERO lag on this thing)* Screen (although I can't tell the difference between a 720P or 1080P screen this size)* Speakers (TIP: if you turn the beats audio off you save battery and the speakers are louder)* Call quality: much clearer than my RAZR HD (I don't say \"what?\" as much anymore)* UI: some people don't like the HTC sense but I find it much nicer than Motorola's* Looks: let's be honest, it matters now.  And this phone is much cooler looking than the Motorolas and the Samsungs.  I think it rivals the iPhone.* TV remote: it's a bit gimmicky, but honestly after using it for a while...it's actually kind of cool* Oh, and it's FASTCONS:* Sense Feed (or whatever the heck they call it) is unnecessary and you should be allowed to disable it* Camera: while some of the features are cool - and the multi-shot is unbelievably fast and cool - the ultrapixel produces noticeably grainy pictures on larger screens.  If you use your phone for facebook/instragram photos only it's probably one of the best phone cameras out there.  If you ever intend to actually crop, edit or print your photos then it may not compare to cameras with more megapixels.* No microSD slot - no matter what they say Verizon must have been responsible for them dropping a feature that's available on other versions of the phone (to make you use more cloud storage and therefore more bandwidth - but I suggest backing up photos using BTSync over wifi).", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of the best HTC, if not Android, phones around! Finally on Verizon!", "Author": "Rocman", "ReviewID": "RMKW6XVTE7PH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[Update 11/1/2013] The latest Android 4.4 KitKat is coming to the One! HTC just announced that all versions of the HTC One will get the latest Android 4.4 update within 90 days.

There's finally a viable S-off exploit that gives you root access! My HTC One is now S-off and fully rooted - that's jailbroken for you Apple fans who might be thinking about switchin' :) This is a BIG PRO!___________________________________________________________________________________After close to 6 months delay (thanks Verizon, go ahead and pat yourself on your back), the HTC One is finally out on the last major US network. As a long time verizon customer - over a decade - this is the first time I've seriously considered leaving Verizon for a phone.Pro:-Unibody all-metal construction with Gorilla glass 2This is BY FAR the most solidly built Android phone, ever, period. I don't usually go all gaga over construction, but this phone is a work of art. I've been fortunate enough to have used a variety of devices (HTC - Thunderbolt/Incredible 2/Rezound, Motorola - bionic/razr/razr maxx/razr maxx hd, Samsung S3, G Nexus), and I can say without reservation this phone is the first true \"iphone killer\" in terms of build quality and construction. And yes, the white strip around the edge is metal and not plastic.-4.7\" 1080P IPS RGB screenHTC has always used quality screens in their phones, and the HTC One doesn't disappoint. The 4.7\" 1080P screen uses IPS panel technology, which is generally considered to be the best quality panel in terms of color production and viewing angle. The Samsung's Galaxy series (S3/S4) uses AMOLED screens, which produce exaggerated and inaccurate color production and more importantly, are dimmer which make the Galaxy phones harder to see outdoors. Also, Samsung uses a lower quality pixel arrangement in the Galaxy series phones called pentile, which basically cheats the eyes by not using all three RGB (red/green/blue) subpixels for every pixel. Some people don't care. But personally, I can't stand reading a AMOLED pentile screen. Do a quick google search and you'll see the difference - it's a well established topic.-Dual front-facing stereo speakers or \"Boomsound\"First of all, the marketing team should be shot for coining the speakers as \"Boomsound\". But these speakers are the real deal. And don't let Beats fool ya - Beats is really just an overpriced equalizer that boosts the bass and highs while sacrificing the mids. The bulk of the amazing audio performance with the HTC One is simple physics. Put the speakers facing the user - no muffled sound and straight path to the ears. Put two speakers and restore stereo capability. Use decent op-amp for the speakers. The result is a surprisingly good mobile music player that can honestly fill up a small room at max volume. And at max volume, there is very little clipping of the sound. And the stereo effect is very pleasant to have, AGAIN. You'd think it's the 1980's when we're rejoicing about having stereo!-nice performance and specsThis phone was originally announced this spring, and even today the phone is still very competitive in terms of performance. That's because it was the first on the market to use the new Qualcom Snapdragon 600 SOC, which is a 1.7Ghz (technically 1.73Ghz) quad core CPU with integrated 4G modem and Adeno 320 for graphics duties. Paired with 2GB of RAM and a generous 32GB of onboard storage, this phone should last me very decently for the next two years.-much better battery performanceOne of the major complaints usually heard against HTC is their battery life or lack thereof. I completely agree - the HTC Thunderbolt and Rezound were fuel guzzling SUVs when it came to battery life. HTC tackled the problem finally with the One. First, they put in a decent size battery - 2300mah @ 3.8V. I would've loved to have more, but this is a respectable size especially given the slim profile of the phone. Second, the use of the aforementioned Snapdragon 600 chip helped to significantly increase efficiency. So far, using GSam battery app, I've tracked my battery life to an average of 1 day 8 hours (phone sleep enabled which turns off data while I am sleeping, about two to 4 hours screen-on time, mostly on 4g LTE, syncing 4 gmails/2 outlook email/one activesync work email). Now, I've disabled ALL of the Verizon crapware and I keep an eye on what's running to minimize rogue programs. Having experienced the Thunderbolt, Rezound, Bionic and the G Nexus, this is amazing battery life. Can't quite compare to the Razr Maxx phones obviously, but those phones have 3300 to 3500 mah batteries!-innovative camera subsystemAgain, the HTC marketing team should be shot with the \"ultrapixel\" moniker. But HTC had balls by doing what they did - enlarge the sensor pixels to 2 um, so that more light can enter each pixel. Then they added a true optical image stabilization (OIS) to the camera. The new iPhone 5S acknowledged this idea by following suit, increasing its own sensor pixels from 1.2 um to 1.5 um. However, the iPhone cheaped out by only going with electronic image stabilization (EIS). The HTC One sacrifices some resolution with the larger pixel sensor - it's \"only\" 4MP compared to 8MP of the iPhone 5s and the 13MP and more with the other phones. In full sunny outdoor shots, the HTC One will produce softer shots than the other phones. HTC's aggressive noise reduction algorithm doesn't help, unfortunately, making the final image even softer. However, in low light situations, which is pretty much all indoor shots and of course at night, the HTC One produces good shots thanks to the larger sensor and OIS.The OIS comes in handy too when taking video, as it dampens out a lot of the high frequency movements. It's less effective against lower frequency shakes. The HTC One can take 1080p video at 30fps. It can also take slow motion video in two modes - 720p at 60 fps (2x slo motion) or 768\u00d7432 at 96 fps (roughly 3x slo mo).-Sense 5 UIHTC did a good job tweaking their Sense user interface for android. It's got a very clean and modern \"flat\" look to it. Very minimalist feel, which I personally like a lot. The blinkfeed isn't as annoying as I thought it would be, and the fact that you can set another screen as your default home screen means you can forget about blinkfeed if you don't like it. Unfortunately you can't remove it outright. In my experience, I disabled Blinkfeed's auto-update, and it seems to have no impact on battery life.-TV remoteYep you can use the phone as a TV remote. And yeah, HTC came out with this before Samsung. Just that HTC really sucks at marketing its stuff, and Samsung is crazy good with marketing so most people don't even know about this.I've tested this function on my 40\" Toshiba and a couple Sony's and Westinghouse TVs at friends. They all work perfectly. The setup takes less than a minute for each tv. I especially love the channel guide - you can search and browse for shows and then just click on the show to tune into whatever channel it is. For example, if I search for \"Modern family\", the phone will tell me if it's playing today (just click on the show and the phone automatically changes the channel) or when it will be on. Or you can search by genre, time, etc. It really is very cool! Definitely a cool feature for show-and-tell at parties.Con:-\"Ultra pixel\" resolution and overly aggresive noise reduction algorithmI wish HTC could have kept the resolution at 8 MP while increasing the sensor size, similar to what Apple did with the iPhone 5s. And as mentioned before, their noise reduction algorithm is a bit too aggressive for my taste, producing images that look a bit soft even in direct sun light.-No removable battery or expandable storageThe battery is built-in and can't be user replaced. There's also no microSD slot to add more storage space. HTC made this tolerable by putting in a decent sized battery and a base model with 32GB. If this came in only 16GB, that would be a deal breaker for me. I still would like to have removable battery, if only so that I can put in a fresh one down the road when the original battery starts to lose capacity. But I guess since nowadays we only hold onto our phones for less than two years, this is less of a concern.I bought extra spare batteries when I had my Rezound. I've only swapped out batteries ONCE. It's just easier to charge up whenever versus carrying extra batteries. But still, removable battery would be a nice feature to have if given the choice. Also, wish HTC would have put in an even larger battery - 3000 mah or more would be so much better!-large sizeThe phone is very comfortable to hold, but it is on the larger side with the 4.7\" screen and dual stereo speakers. My hands are just large enough to barely use it with one hand - I basically have to \"sit\" the bottom of the phone on my pinky since the phone is so slippery. I can definitely see people with smaller hands feeling a little overwhelmed at first. But it's not too ridiculous, and I think you'd get used to it very quickly. Its thin profile actually makes it very pocketable. It feels smaller than my old Rezound in my pocket, which was almost twice as thick.All in all, so far I am truly impressed with the HTC One. I paid full retail - $199.99 when it first came out. I wish I had waited for the amazing $49.99 deal!!! And the blue HTC One at best buy - go check it out! If HTC can put in a high resolution \"ultrapixel\" camera, improve the camera OIS, put in a bigger battery (3000mah at least), AND start at 64GB for the base model going up to 128GB, then it would be the perfect phone!HTC are you listening? :)", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Ariel Ramon Echevarria", "ReviewID": "RF0KZ0IQZONC4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose 5 stars because it is the best phone I have had to date.

I searched around again and apparently the HTC one is always on power save mode (this is built into their version and cannot be disabled. My battery complaint is now moot.)Over the summer I was salivating over a new smartphone. It was between the S4 and the ONE for me.-----------------------------------Why I chose the One instead of the S4:------------------------------------It has less \"bloatware\". Samsung packed a lot in their Touchwiz that I just didn't see myself making practical use of. I prefer a simple, clean approach like the ONE has.-Aesthetics. The sexy unibody aluminum design beats Samsung plastic any day.-The display is more true-to-life/naturally colored than the often brighter S4 screen (due to different technology).-----------------------------------Things I may miss because I chose the ONE instead of the S4:------------------------------------The ability to expand memory (ONE comes with 32gb, and since I'm a casual user I didn't think too much about it.)-The 14 MP camera. HTC has coined the \"ultrapixel\" as a marketing term, but you can't compare the two cameras that way. The pixel sizes and sensors are all different. I think the S4 comes with greater detail, but the ONE is better in low light situations. There are many comparisons online at any rate. Honestly, the camera was the only hang up I had of picking this phone. But so far, it's doing well.-I believe the NFC is better on the S4, because the plastic doesn't interfere as much with the signal (or so, a Verizon rep told me.) If you want to share mobile-to-mobile, or use a camera like the Canon RX100 II, this is the way to go. But that's a feature I don't think I'll need much.-A gorrila glass screen. I'm accident prone, so I'll have to be careful with my ONE. (oops--HTC one has it as well!)My parents got the S4, so we'll see how they both hold up.-----------------------------------IMPRESSIONS-----------------------------------I adore the ONE. It's been on the market for half a year but it still holds its own among the top smartphones available. Verizon is the last of the major phone providers to offer this model. It runs Android 4.2.2 right out of the box, which is pretty sweet.So far, my impression of the phone is everything I expected. The capabilities are astounding. I'm perhaps overawed because I switched from an archaic, no-one-has-this-anymore prepaid \"dumb\" phone that I have reluctantly used for the past four years... but pretty much everyone can tell you that this is one amazing phone.The only problem I have with this so far is battery life. I turn off my Wi-Fi and mobile data when it's not in use, but that doesn't help much. Most of the battery keeps the android system running (73% in my phone--there is a breakdown of how the power is apportioned if you find \"usage\" under the \"power\" tab.)I called HTC, and a representative verified that this version of the ONE does NOT include the power save mode.EDIT: ---I searched up HTC again. It turns out that Verizon went ahead and made the phone perpetually on power save mode. Which I find really ironic since neither the HTC rep or the Verizon rep I talked to earlier had anything to mention about it.One downside to the Verizon version is that you can't root the phone--the HTC developer's tools were disabled within 24 hours of its release.... Which is pretty disappointing, since it would be really neat to play with.One month later: Yep, it's still awesome. That's all I have to say.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Smartphone That Was Worth the Wait", "Author": "Average \"K\"", "ReviewID": "R34R713ON67PXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HTC One has been out on Verizon for about a year at this point, and even though HTC has announced that it's successor will be hitting carriers soon, I chose to opt for the tried and true original for my recent upgrade.  There are several reasons that I didn't get one of the newest android phones, and having previously worked in the cellular industry for several years I no longer feel the need to have the latest thing.  Following that kind of mentality often gets you burned, and you end up with buyer's remorse when things don't go as advertised.These days, I prefer to stick with phones that have already established themselves as capable and dependable devices.  Furthermore, I've owned phones with just about every operating system available, so I feel confident about what software can offer a smartphone user in terms of an overall experience.  My wife and I both had our choice of devices to order, and she chose the Galaxy S4 which is also an excellent Android device with more features than she will ever need or use.  I chose the HTC One, because I wanted something more simple yet powerful and technically diverse enough to make my experience as smooth as possible.In many ways, the S4 and the HTC One are the best Android phones on the market right now, and their popularity reflects that.  The \"One\" is a great multi purpose phone that shines in all of the right areas.  It really doesn't overspecialize in any department though, so there are some features that may fall short for some consumers.  For example, the camera isn't as capable as the ones found on competing devices, but it's good enough for the user who wants to be able to capture shots on the go.The \"One\" gets wonderful reception and really takes advantage of the 4G LTE network with an impressively speedy processor that provides lightning fast response for web browsing or loading apps.  HTC also fitted the \"One\" with an exceptional high resolution screen that provides vibrant, colorful images in high definition.  Watching Youtube videos on this thing is as good as watching on my computer monitor at home.One of the shortfalls of this device is that the phone only comes with 32GB of internal memory without an external expansion port.  That's fine for me since I only stream music and take a few photos here and there, but if I really wanted to download movies or download all of my digital albums, the internal memory wouldn't cut it.  The sturdy aluminum body also precludes the ability to remove the battery from the phone which might be inconvenient for some should it need replacing.I really can't say much else that other people haven't said about the device in terms of features, but having used pretty much every smartphone OS, I can say that Android is my favorite hands down.  My last phone was a Windows phone, and despite the fact that the user interface was perhaps the most fluid and simplistic of the operating systems, the lack of platform support from outside developers was frustrating.Android has found its place in the market over the years, and their support base continues to grow.  That being said, the HTC One is a great phone, and with the price its a tough act to beat.  Even though there are phones out that might outclass the \"One\" it still holds its own for those who may be late adopters like me.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Victor", "ReviewID": "R1LOJ27C0VVBVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best phones to date, i personally love the full metal casing giving the phone a very sturdy feel to it. the front facing speakers with beats audio was one of the best designs that HTC put into the phone and it is a night and day experience when compared to the sound coming from other smart phones. the camera is pretty good although when it comes to bad lighting the photo does suffer a bit but i didnt buy the phone for the camera. the phone hasnt slowed down a bit since i got it and runs smooth i have no problems with it whatsoever.my only gripe is that i cant install an sd card into but i dont use that much space on my phone anyway it comes with 32gb standard so thats all im going to need for now anyway. i would definitely recommend this phone to anyone", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Latest upgrades solve some gripes; good overall phone", "Author": "Hobbes", "ReviewID": "R3M2GQUGTH4PYN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just purchased the M7 just following the release of the M8, and I have no reservations about buying last year's model.  Coming from two years using an up-to-date iPhone 4s, I was worried about the move to Android, but I am relatively pleased with the choice so far.  Of course, the M7 has its drawbacks, which Apple iOS brings into focus.  My old iPhone 4s serves to highlight some of the strengths and weaknesses of my new M7, but this is not meant to be a comparison between the two.  Here are my thoughts.Design+The HTC One is (even) better looking in person.  I was surprised at how thin it is.+/-Size-wise, the HTC One M7 is exactly how big I want it to be for functionality.  Unfortunately, it is a little big for jeans pockets and the M7 is just small enough that I can handle it one-handed.  My old 4s looks dainty in comparison to the HTC One, and I would not want a bigger phone.+Buttons are placed almost ideally for me and I no longer miss the physical iPhone home button.-However, the keyboard is no easier to use than Apple's, despite the large screen size.  One major annoyance is that when I type keys near the bottom of the keyboard, I often-very often-hit the back buttom \"<\" by mistake.+The mini usb charger cable stays firmly in the HTC One.  I cannot stand the iPhone 5 charger that falls out.+The speakers are nice, but they are not deal makers by any means.  I just do not use my phone like that.+The camera is a big improvement over the iPhone 4s, and it is probably in the ballpark of the 5s.  It's no DSLR.-I miss the physical mute button on the iPhone, but truly, the HTC One volume buttons are better than iPhone's.-I miss not being able to dock the HTC One in my Bose iPhone dock (I really blame this on Apple for having proprietary connections)FunctionalityIt took me some time to become accustomed to Android.  It is less intuitive than iOS, but Android feels far more capable and customizable, if not quite so smooth as iOS.-I suffer through way more hiccups, stalling and crashing with Android than I ever experienced with iOS.  Could be me.  Could be the phone.+The HTC One came loaded with the latest Android OS (4.4); some people are concerned about update support from HTC.+/-There is an entire Android environment out there.  It is not as cohesive as Apple's environment, but it is clearly more flexible.  For example, I have easy access to integrated Amazon content that I did not have with Apple.  I had immediate access to my entire Kindle library just by entering my Amazon logon/password.  Google Play is just as easy to use as the Apple Store, and I do not miss iTunes at all.+Android has many of the same security features as iOS, even if it does not control Apps in the same way.  For example, I easily encrypted my phone during set up; Android now has a \"find my phone\" feature that allows you to disable the phone (and it is ON by default).  On one hand, I do not like are the constant \"requests\" from Apps to log in or approve permissions.  On the other hand, Android is far more transparent about what kind of permissions your Apps require.+/-The user interface, such as scrolling, swiping, and typing, is not bad, but it does not have the refined feel of an Apple.  However, in my experience, the Android auto-correct and fill-in features are much better than on iOS.-I have not tried to migrate my iTunes music to my phone yet, but I do not look forward to it.-My vehicles and stereo equipment are compatible with iPhones, but have no built-in support for Android.  When I connect my HTC One to my 2013 vehicle radio using the AUX jack, I get hissing and fuzz, and cannot browse the player or advance or pause songs using the radio controls.  Moreover, I lose all of the radio-based menu control I had with the iPhone.  This is a potential safety issue for the careless driver and perhaps my greatest disappointment in switching to Android.+Blinkfeed, which is part of the proprietary HTC user interface that streams semi-customizable news and social updates to your phone, can now be turned off or moved to a different screen.  Yes, you can now turn that off.-Bloatware.  This is something Apple users do not have to put up with.  There is way too much preloaded software on this phone that you cannot remove.  A lot of it is vulnerable social media kinds of software like Facebook and Google+.  I like my privacy and would prefer to be able to remove most of this bloatware.  Also, the phone comes preloaded with redundant software.  For example, I have multiple programs for saving and viewing photos right out of the box.  Most people just want one good one.-Following the last comment, the HTC One/Android is very pushy about trying to get users to download more bloatware and interconnect all of their media and electronic life.  For example, I rarely, rarely, use Facebook.  But once I opened it, the HTC One would not stop harassing me about giving Blinkfeed access to Facebook (it wanted to stream Facebook updates to the Blinkfeed \"wallpaper\").  Likewise, the HTC One wanted me to update several bloatware apps I never use.  When I closed the update notices, they simply reappeared each and every following day.  Apple iOS would not have done that to me.-/+Battery life.  This phone uses about half its battery in a day's use.  I am not a heavy user though.  My old phone, which only ran 3G, and not 4GLTE, used about 15% of its battery per day when it was new!  It's not horrible; I don't need to recharge my phone halfway through the day, but it could be better.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "HTC will never top this phone", "Author": "rockchalk06", "ReviewID": "R11C0F5D99Z33U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone now for about 6 months. I have nothing but high high praises for it.I shopped for about 2 months tapping into every youtube video, review and social media site I could. I finally settled on the One. I really haven't found much negative about it.As for Features, where do I start? One of the most beautiful screens I have ever seen. Gorilla Glass to prevent scratches, clear, very vibrant colors in all settings. Being outside with this phone does, diminish the visual aspect, but this is the draw back to smart phones. The Zoe feature is where this phone shines above all others. I have made some amazing short movies with really no work at all. I have programmed my One for all major TV manufactures with the remote feature. This is one of my favorite features on it. I can control most TV's in restaurants and bars. Nice little feature during basketball season when some fool wants to watch Jersey Shore in a sports bar.I gave the ease of use 4/5 stars as this isn't the easiest phone in the world to operate. I had been an android user for years and switched to IOS for a few years. Switching back to the One was difficult at first, but with the power of youtube, I have tapped into every feature I have. With the upgrade of Kitkat, it made it a bit easier to run. I love the larger screen of the current generation of smart phones, but you can get too big. The iPhone fits well in your hand, but your left wanting more. The One fits this bill perfectly. Its 4.7\" screen fits well in the hand and give you the ease of one handed operation even with small hands. I have an Otterbox Commuter series case on mine and the overall size is still perfect. I really cant tap into all the amazing features of this phone without taking up 2 hours of your time!Battery, Here is where gave the phone another 4/5 stars. Its running the Snapdragon 600 @ 1.7 GHz so battery life is not going to be that of the old Nokia 5120's, but it does lack some of what I think should be coming out of a 2300 mAh battery. With the new Kitkat upgrade, you are able to turn BlinkFeed off giving you a good increase. I never had much use for it as I have Sports Center for well sports and each social media/news site provides updates. You are able to turn off all unused apps as well. It comes preloaded with a bunch of stuff I will never or have ever used. You have the ability to hide them and force stop these apps. This was a major increase in battery life for me. You can also limit the CPU, but lets face it, you bought this phone for its speed so that not the best idear. Adjust your screen brightness and your set. I will take the phone off the charger around 0430 hours and use it as my morning news and sports updates, spend an 8 hour shift running texts and some twitter updates. Around 1500 when I arrive home, i am usually sitting at 55% battery life. By the time I hit the sack, its still around 25%. Not to bad for my lifestyle.Performance. I compared this to several different brands and style of smart phones and I was overly drawn to the One. It may not have the larger Snapdragon 800 or over 2 GHz, but it still runs super fast.Call Quality is better than anything I have ever experienced. It will filter out back ground noise which is great for being on the road. I log over around 1200 miles a month and am on the phone much of these miles. The filter has made it much better while on the road.Overall I can't say enough about this phone. I was blown away. Unless HTC pulls the new M8 out of hands of God himself, its going to be hard to top this phone!", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "By far the best phone I've ever had.", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R1NKRSVI6A2F10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I go into the review, a little background: This is my first Android phone, my last phone was an iPhone 4 which I really liked.  I do have an Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1) that I've owned for about a year, so there was not much of a learning curve switching from iOS to Android.  I got the HTC One about 5 days ago and I will most likely be updating this review in the future.Review:First of all, I want to say that I'm in love with this phone.  It's sleek, it's beautiful, it's smooth and, most importantly, it functions nearly flawlessly.  Here's a breakdown of the pros/cons as I see them:Major Pros:- The design and aesthetics: The HTC One truly is a beautiful piece of technology.  It's gorgeous and feels like it was designed for my hand.  The weight of the phone strikes just the right balance and the chamfered edges and rounded back make the phone a pleasure to hold.  This feels every bit like a device that costs $600, which is not something that can be said for any other Android phone.- The display: Incredibly sharp, vivid and bright.  I have never been able to make out an individual pixel on this device.  Even the smallest of fonts is sharp and clear.  The colors are vivid, but not over-saturated like my sister's Galaxy S4 and the display can be very bright.  I haven't used it in a full afternoon sun yet, but there hasn't been a single instance of the display being hard to see.- Performance: As long as I have a decent connection the phone doesn't miss a step.  I had a friend tell me that all android phones tended to suffer from stuttering and being generally a bit glitchy, but I haven't noticed that at all with this phone.  It never slows down.  I've had multiple big apps running in the background in addition to multiple widgets and it's still lightning fast.  It's also marginally faster than my sisters Galaxy S4 and absolutely crushes my friend's iPhone 5.Minor Pros:- \"BoomSound\" Speakers:  I'm a bit of a stickler for audio quality so I generally use headphones, however, for sharing the occasional youtube video the speakers are a huge improvement over my iPhone 4 and absolutely overpower my sister's galaxy S4.  They can easily fill a quiet room with sound and are much clearer than any other phone speaker I've ever heard.- Size: I find the size to be just right, but my hands are a bit larger than average.  Having a phone this size does enable having the beautiful 4.7 in display and the speakers, but if it were any larger then I think I would have problems using the phone with one hand.- Sense 5: My only other extended experience with Android is with my Samsung tablet which has Samsung's touchwiz skin.  I find HTC Sense to be considerably smoother and more aesthetically pleasing. In addition there is very little bloatware.  My sister's Galaxy S4 (and my Galaxy Note 10.1) may do a thousand cool tricks, but few are actually practical.  I haven't found anything about Sense that I would change with one exception: BlinkFeed.- Camera:  HTC is catching some flak because the photos taken with the 4 MP camera aren't as sharp as photos taken with higher resolution phone cameras, but this doesn't bother me.  The photos it takes are plenty sharp for viewing on the phone display or a computer and, more importantly, the colors are accurate and low light performance is brilliant.  Zoe is also pretty cool, but I haven't used it much yet.  There are enough software features for me, but those that like to tweak settings and filters, etc. will probably like the Galaxy S4 software better.Minor Cons:- BlinkFeed: [EDIT: NO LONGER A PROBLEMS SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF SENSE 5.5]- Battery Life: While it's really not as bad as some people make it out to be, I definitely need to charge it every night.  It will get through a solid 16 hours of moderate use and have about 15-20 percent battery left.  While at college I'm going to have to bring a charger with me wherever I go because I use it much more heavily during the semester.- No MicroSD slot: Not a big deal for me, but if you have a lot of HD quality movies that you want to put on your phone then this isn't the phone for you.  32 GB is plenty for me, however.- Headphone jack: [EDIT: THIS IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM]- Beats Audio: For those who are not familiar with what Beats Audio actually does, here is a brief explanation.  Beats Audio is actually a type of equalization that boosts the bass and treble frequencies while reducing the midrange frequencies.  This makes the more \"interesting\" frequencies pop out and hides the \"duller\" midrange.  The problem with this is that the midrange carries most of the musical information and is the frequency range that I appreciate the most.  Now, since Beats can just be turned off, why is this a con?  Well, apparently as part of the agreement between HTC and Monster (The company that produces Beats) HTC removed the equalization tool from the google play music app.  That means that I had to download a 3rd party equalization app that is compatible with google play music rather than being able to use the one that is normally integrated.  Not a big deal, but annoying.Major Cons: None so far, but I will update in the future if I find some.In conclusion, this is by far the best phone I've ever had.  The problems i have with it are minor and I find that the phone is worth every penny paid for it.  More importantly, this device truly does make my life easier.  It's never distracting and always provides a high quality interaction.  I also want to note that I don't mean to bash the Galaxy S4, I was only using it as a comparison because it's the only comparable phone I had access to.  My sister absolutely loves her Galaxy S4 and I'm sure it's also a great choice.  If you have any questions, comments, etc. then feel free to leave them as I will probably read them.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "The ONE To Rule Them All", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R3BQSHCNVCL6DB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What is there to say about this phone? If I just write about it, I'm just going to ramble on and on. So to save everyone some grief, here are bullet points (my direct comparisons are to the iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note 2, but mainly to the Galaxy S4):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5 is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the Droid DNA/HTC Butterfly's screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 4.7\" 1080p(468ppi) form. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Why do most reviewers laud the iPhone 5's aluminum construction so much, when it chips and nicks so easily?? If you want a true masterpiece in design and craftsmanship, look no further. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other case). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication(*cough*Samsung*ahem*).3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick!5) For a near 5-incher, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 2. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance.6) The UI and software design is now very minimal and simplistic. For better or for worse, if you are used to the old Sense UI's, you will need some readjusting. Personally, I like this new one better. If you're a casual news reader, then you'll like new default home screen which displays a gathering of news sources - some of its own partners, some for your Facebook and Twitter, etc. - to form a Flipboard style of news reader. Personally, I'm a huge Pulse news reader fan, so I only use that.The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2300mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. Another bad thing that I've noticed is it charges slower than most other phones.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4, the One is lacking. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4's fancy functions. The S4's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light. The S4 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and MUCH better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S4 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S4 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones right now.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Harry", "ReviewID": "R6NLIBUEVSN9C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If your Verizon contract is up get your phone on Amazon instead of the VZW website.

After reading many reviews, watching you tube video reviews and unboxings, I decided on the HTC On. The phones I were debating on were the HTC, Samsung Galaxy S4, and iPhone 5S. And, ultimately I was sold on the HTC One.The good:1. Build quality. The phone is solid. Made of aluminum and glass, with zero gap construction. There is no creaking or other signs of sub-par construction.2. The display. The lcd screen produces a beautiful picture with dark darks and bright whites. The display is great.3. Sound. The much talked about Boom Sound front facing speakers are something that must be experienced. I used to use my headphones to watch You Tube videos even when I was alone and there wasn't a chance of disturbing others. Now I use the sound through the speakers.The sound is phenomenal!4. HTC Zoe. I won't get to much into this because there is a lot to do in this feature. But, I will say that the built in feature allows the user to create 30 second videos with sound and editing at the push of a button.The end product is totally shareable directly after creation.5. Speed, storage and battery. The processor being used makes the phone very speedy. There is practically no lag. Switching between screens and tasks is fluid and smooth. The phone has 32gigs of storage which is more than enough for me. I have to say that I don't use my phone as a music player so I don't fill it up with music.  Battery life has been pretty good after I got over the honeymoon stage of always using my phone. I do consider myself a power user, minus gaming, and I get through a twelve hour work day without charging.6. Size. I believe that HTC has found the \"sweet spot\" with the size of this phone. Coming from the Samsung Galaxy S3, which I found to be a good size if not a little wide, I think the HTC being a little taller and thinner is a better form factor.  And I feel the size of the screen is better than the more petite iPhone 5S.And now the Bad;1. The camera. I mentioned HTC Zoe as a great feature, but the camera used for this feature is kind of bad. The auto focus is spotty and the clarity of the pictures are also hit or miss. I have found that I can stand in the same spot and take the same pictures and get widely varying results. At this price point and quality of product, the camera should be much better.2. The aluminum body. Here we go again. I know I said the build quality is a plus, and it is a solid feeling phone. I prefer plastic because in my experience while plastic will often scratch when dropped,  aluminum will dent. I think scratches are easier to live with than dents.And that's it. As you can see. The plusses far out weigh the minuses. Of the two cons the camera is the one that is find to be the most egregious. The competitors at this price point are putting far superior cameras in their products. My wifes iPhone 5S produces pictures that blow the HTC out of the water.But overall the phone is probably the best smartphone available. I have had the chance to work with the iPhone 5S and the new Samsung Note 3, and i am still sold on the HTC One. And there are rumors of software updates that may help with the camera.I would give the HTC One 4 1/2 stars.

The phone is in general as great, but it is missing a few features like: (1) the radio (Sprint phone worked as a radio by using the cable of the headphones or speakers as antennae. I used the radio every morning, so it was a big disappointment for me that verizon does not have it), (2) the power saver mode (which really saved the battery without me having to pay much attention), (3) the visual voicemail (it is available for both, but Sprint's was free and a lot easier to use). The other thing that bothered me with Verizon, unlike Sprint, is that it does not allow me to uninstall many applications. I disabled the undesired applications, but it's my phone so I should be able to uninstall anything I want.Overall, I love the phone and Verizon does have faster signal than Sprint!

While I really liked some things about the update there were other things that just did not work for me. My first week with the HTC One was tough since I was missing several iPhone features. None the less I persisted and it grew on me. Several months into it I can tell you that iOS is a better OS for a phone than Android- it's just easier to get things done. Android is more flexible and powerful, however, it's a phone and I don't need power and flexibility. For me, an appliance is better than a computer since I just need to make calls and get stuff done.The HTC One hardware is every bit as nice and well made as the iPhone but there are some shortcomings. For example, the iPhone is easier to turn on and off (no small thing) and I really miss the dedicated silencer switch. Perhaps the biggest drawback for me is the fact that I can't pull a preamp signal when plugging it into my car audio system. The iPhone is way ahead in car audio integration.So why is this phone the best I've ever had despite my gripes? Well, the HTC One is an amazing portable multi media device. Its screen is the best I've seen and the Beats Audio is not just a gimmick- it works surprisingly well. I find myself watching YouTube and Netflix regularly. I had both of these programs on the iPhone but the experience was nowhere near as good. No phone is perfect- they all have their pluses and minuses. The best you can hope for is that the sum is greater than the parts and HTC hit the ball out of the park with this offering.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love This Phone, but Bluetooth an Issue", "Author": "D. Violette", "ReviewID": "R29NA8V5LRSGBI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What a deal I got from Amazon vs Verizon!  Saved hundreds of dollars on this phone.  VZ hit me with a 30 dollar upgrade charge, but better than $599 they wanted for continuing my unlimited data plan if I bought the phone from them!The One is sleek and sexy and works very well for my non-nerd needs.  No regrets with this phone;  VZ's LTE service is another matter...Updated review, minus one star, to add that it's now well known that this model has significant problems with bluetooth devices.  My prior Plantronics BT worked very well with my old HTC Thunderbolt; but not with my current One.  The forums are full of similar complaints; apparently it's more an issue with the One than with BT devices themselves.  HTC's supposed to be working on a fix, from what I've read.  I'm reluctant to spend more and more trying different BT devices.  Shame on HTC for crippling such a nice phone.  If you've found a good BT device that works very well with this phone, do tell...Updated 2/26/14: based on more research and generally favorable reviews, I purchased a Samsung HM3300 BT earpiece on Amazon.  It was so affordable that I had doubts it would work well.  Though I haven't used it extensively, the few times I've called land lines 3000 miles away it performed so well that the callee didn't know I was using a BT device.  I (but not they) could hear a bit of an echo when I spoke, but maybe there's some setting that I should tweak.  No echo when they spoke.  All in all, at this point, I'm thrilled to finally have finally found a suitable BT that appears to be working well on my One.Samsung HM3300 Bluetooth Headest (Blue)", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "In-depth review: as tested on Verizon", "Author": "John L Murphy \"Fionnch\u00fa\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y9GDHFIM81ML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found out about this phone when I was on the verge of ordering between two others. Here's why I decided to choose the HTC One. I wanted storage for music, an Android interface, and a solid device with a larger screen and an easier keyboard to use. (I updated this review 2/26 as the KitKat 4.4 Android update changed for the better a key feature, allowing me to hide Blinkfeed entirely, as well as adding battery saving mode to location and making widgets slide from the left differently than before. The phone works fine after testing it nearly two months, glad to report.)Upgrading my loyal but dying Droid X after 3.5 years, I was urged by a genial Verizon representative to opt for the HTC One rather than Moto-X or Droid Ultra. It was with my contract half the price of those, so I wondered why it might be better. I researched the statistics, found out it had 32 GB memory (more like 25 after VZ bloatware, Google apps and the usual installations, but as 7 GB is similarly added to fill the smaller 16 GB of Ultra or Moto, well worth considering), and the tech site and user reviews were consistently and measurably stronger than its competitors.The aluminum component is handsome. It generates heat when the USB cord is attached to the computer or when it may charge or sync. While the guide states this is normal, be aware. I have a slim plastic case to cradle it in. The 4.7 inch screen is the right size, neither too large nor too small, and the device fits the hand well. The fonts are readable and the customization of accounts, apps, and widgets is easy to understand after playing with it for a short while.Using the phone, the touchpad and the sound quality work well. I did not notice any problems and any smartphone user should encounter no problems in getting the hang of the layout. A helpful site via the HTC page allows you to sample select tones, install wallpaper, sync e-mail accounts, pick apps and widgets, and do all but import contacts before you get the phone. A sync via FB or HTC for the old phone's contacts offer two options once this new phone is activated.I find the larger size in my hand easier for bigger fingers. Fonts are handsome and the layout is well-designed for touch and vision. The keyboard allows foreign accents far more smoothly than the Droid (Android 2.2) and the interface is friendlier and faster to type with. (4.4 adds a blue line under misspelled words, so if you use other languages you may want to save the foreign words typed in so it recognizes them.) HTC One allows more apps customization and at least you can hide the likes of VZ Navigator, Verizon Ringtones, or Madden NFL a bit deeper than before in folders. I bundle a lot of unused apps within folders, minimizing those on screen.This does mean that Google is more aggressive to \"offer\" you its guidance, and even when syncing photos and music via the HTC system (clunky) it pops up to peep in on your actions. The Google+ personalized interactive service wants to sign you up, and the HRC interface does sell the installed Blinkfeed as prime real estate for lots of bright feeds. This may entice or annoy. The Android Jelly Bean 4.3 upgrade (my phone came as 4.1) eased if it did not eliminate one major complaint from customers. (4.4 eliminates it, however). BlinkFeed can be shifted left from another choice for your home screen and under 4.4 it can be removed or turned off. Glad to note this feature, much lobbied for, is finally here.The Zoe camera feature to capture three consecutive shots (to make as it were a flipbook?) is novel. I am not a camera buff, but customers may like or loathe the abilities of this camera vs. others. Also, neither the video nor the gaming elements enter into my normal usage, but others may want to look into specifications, as these speakers may tempt them.Thought has been given to the way the gestures by fingers can work, and HTC adapts different combinations for various purposes. While the speakers were touted as much better than the usually awful tinniness of a phone speaker, the front-facing combination on top and bottom do not sound to me that drastically different from, say, a little laptop, but it is progress, I suppose, from squawk. Still, I expected more oomph. A nice touch is the pair of little headphones that are included, to enhance the bass-heavy (naturally) Beats Audio feature that is installed (and engraved) on the phone.Speaking of inside, its commendably hefty (against the competition) 2300 mAh battery is not removable. I've charged it from the danger zone of about 5% to full in 2.5+ hours from a wall socket. The battery life of the HTC is debatable, and 4G LTE is very demanding. I try to minimize my apps or widgets and follow suggestions to ease up both power demands and non-WiFi usage. The guide tells you not to charge it off a USB cord attached to a computer...There's no SD sound card, either; a mini SIM card is all. I wish Android phones did not mimic Apple's lockdown, as this was one reason I chose Android years ago. This trend may push users to download more data as unlimited plans appear to be fading for many carriers, or soon will be when you upgrade. Still, 25 GB of \"real\" capacity for memory allows much of one's files, music, or photos to be stored here, or uploaded in a cloud.Therefore, despite some small caveats, I can't say this phone does not deliver most of the goods as promised. It's up against the Galaxy with more name recognition, the Droids and Moto, not to mention the iPhone. Consider the metal build, the care in an easily understood interface, and the Android range of options as recommending this, with general approval.While not all of these details may please everyone, HTC's attention to improvements shows some welcome progress. For instance, although one more feature not in this phone despite claims some places to the contrary (for Verizon at least) is the lack of a on-off power-saver mode. Yet, this apparently is embedded by the newer Snapdragon installation into the phone's system itself. I do note that a sleep mode is the default and that it appears to replicate most of what a power-saver setting does. It appears that HTC and Verizon are following the lead of Android's more recent phones in shifting some choices away from the consumer, but arguably they are stowing away within this phone what used to be accessible. As phone consumers, we need to press our case to carriers. Google and Verizon pack a lot of clout, admittedly.I'm willing to give HTC's Taiwanese makers the benefit of the doubt, as I encourage competition and not rushing after the phone that has the highest market share as my ultimate criterion.

For context my last phone was a droid 2 global which I had for 3 years, loved it, never had any problems other than somewhat poor battery life. The HTC One is a substantial upgrade over the last phone, which was android 2 based, HTC one is android 4. Mostly used for texts, email, news, podcast, web, navigation, minor games. Have not used it for any work functions.  I will just list below but overall I highly recommend the phone, it's fantastic. My cons are really all minor and would not negatively influence me from purchasing the same phone again.Pros:-Very fast both in phone functions and network (4g lte)-Camera is great, excellent photo quality, limited zoom though.-Google Now service is interesting if not always useful.- phone settings all available from pull down screen at any time.- Thin but has great weight to it. Feels well built and has survived a couple 5 foot falls without any dents or damage-Boots up very fast.- IR blaster surprisingly useful for tv/cable box at home.- very easy transfer of pics and contacts from old phone with HTC app.Neutral:-Blink feed. Frankly never used it, never saw the need to. You can't turn it off but I just pushed it to the far left of my home pages and it never gets looked at. Social media users might like it, I don't see any need for it but doesn't detract from the phone in any way.- cosmetic, I don't like the the curved back of the phone. Also there is a black edge all around the screen. I wish the actual screen ran to the edges of the housing.- miss the hard keyboard.Cons: - Screen scratches very easily. Just get a screen protector on it and you'll be fine.- infrequent freezing or not recognizing touch when using built-in browser. Other browsers no issues.- Volume toggle is very smooth no differentiation between vol up and vol down. In other words without looking at the side of the phone I can't tell if I'm pushing vol up vol down or just futiley pushing the side of the phone casing.  Not an issue when using the phone in front of you, but I often listen to podcasts or music and it's annoying to take out the phone from my pocket and look at it to find the volume toggle. I just wish it had a better feel to it.- also Volume function does not rotate with the screen. I wish the Vol slider rotated when holding the phone sideways. In other words when watching Netflix I have to push the left volume button (usually volume up)  to make the volume slider move right. Previous phones I have had switched the functions based on the orientation of the screen.- Phone speakers and tones. The speakers are front facing and very good for a phone my issue is the phone is very loud. Even at the lowest volume setting the phone is way too loud. and then holding volume down strangely puts the phone in vibrate mode not silent mode. So to go silent you hold down vol down, and then push volume up to go silent. Odd. On top of that the selection of ringtones and alert noises is ridiculous.  There is a total of 1 out of the 20 or so ring tones that actually sounds like a phone and not some random cyborg playing the flute or the theme from bambi.- headphone jack - guessing here but it seems like the switch to headphones is software and not hardware. When you plug in headphones there is a delay before audio switches , and sounds still play through the phone speakers when headphones are plugged in. So when listening to a podcast I have missed calls and texts because the alert chimes play through the speakers not through the headphones so I didn't hear it.-Battery- could be better, but still very good, will last a few hours of constant use. Takes longer than desired to reach full charge.- can't turn off WiFi notifications. Phone constantly alerts you that WiFi is available, and then when you turn off WiFi, the phones alerts you that your WiFi is off and you might want to turn it on. Bizarre. seems to only be an issue with Verizon version. Not huge issue but annoying that it always takes up a spot in the staus bar.Again none of these issues would keep me from purchasing the phone again, just personal preference things I would change if possible.

After 2 days can say I'm very disappointed. Phone arrived in timely fashion but would not activate without Verizon's help. No instruction book, have to use on line manuals. Very hard to operate the basics (apps, internet connectivity, screens, settings, etc.). Battery life sucks so far, could be just using a lot of juice for original set up. Back of phone does get warm but a cover will solve that problem. Call quality was fine.  Will proceed further with set up this weekend and will advise further after some studying and practice.Part 2- Much happier today. Still learning the ins and outs (on-line manuals at Verizon and HTC,and YouTube videos help). Have phone set up and customized and can say I am totally pleased. Battery seems to be lasting longer (first couple of charges may not have been a full re-charge) but since the battery is sealed we will have to live with it. Upgrading rating to 5 stars.Part 3/FINAL- Solidly built phone and beautiful screen images. Easy navigation once you get familiar with HTC. Camera OK for me (don't use it that much). Battery life seems acceptable for calls and lite use of apps, heavier users (games/vids/music) will encounter problems, may be a deal breaker for you.DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.P.S.

I did a lot of research and was choosing between a Samsung galaxy s4 and the HTC one m7 to save money since I didn't want to pay $200 for the newest phone. I'm so glad I went with the HTC one. As a new user to smartphones, the HTC one was easy to navigate and walked me through personalizing the phone the way I wanted it. The processor is great and quick and the screen is big and clear compared to other phones. HTC really put a lot into this phone and keep getting better with their new HTC one m8.The phone is light and I love having the speakers on the front instead of the side or back make watching or listening to music awesome and plus, I don't need to cup my hand around it to hear anything. I use a UAG phone case which protects it well and doesn't inhibit the speakers or use of the phone at all. I wish it had a sd card slot, but 32 gigs of internal memory is a lot, but with all the online storage programs available means I hardly use any phone memory.The android store and program I think is better than apple's store. I have a chromecast too which works great when I control it with my phone. I highly recommend this phone to anyone wanting to save money and get a great phone. I got my for 0.1 cent on amazon after amazon refunded me $50 after I had bought it for $50 and the price dropped the same day.

I've dropped the phone a few times from around three feet and nothing major had happened, just a few minor scratches. Unfortunately I did recently drop it onto asphalt and took a small chunk out of the corner of the phone. The screen didn't break though.As for the operating system... It's what I expected, an Android OS with some of HTC's extra stuff. The Blink feed isn't too annoying, in fact I have forgotten about it since I set my home page to a different screen. I haven't turned it off though, because sometimes it is nice to get an overview of my topics.What I like the most about this phone, aside from the look of it, is the gestures HTC has included. It saves a lot of time when doing somethings. The thing I like least is that the phone will get fairly hot when watching Netflix for a few hours, but nowhere near high enough to be harmful.

It's beautiful, really well-designed. The construction is suberb--you can really see the craftsmanship--and that's why I prefer HTC over Galaxy phones. I had an old Galaxy phone and it looked and felt very cheap. This screen is flawless! I agree with everything that's been said in the reviews. Obviously it's too early to give an in-depth analysis, and even if I've had it for a while I don't think mine would be full of tech lingo and wisdom (I'm moderately techy; I know what root means, but I don't know how to do it nor do I want to try...), but I'll give my pros and cons list nonetheless:PROS:- Aesthetics: The screen is absolutely amazing. Coming from an old prepaid Galaxy phone (I refuse to say which, although you can probably guess...), I was VERY impressed with the screen. It's clear, it's sharp, and very true to colors. The screen is bright and--combined with the phone's beautiful metallic-blue exterior--makes for stunning aesthetics.-  Speakers/Sound: The front speakers are what really drew me to the HTC One. Music's very important to me and I think this phone's got the best sound. It should be standard to put speakers on the front of a phone. Also, Beats Audio is integrated into the sound and I like the effect.- Layout/Firmware/whatever you call it...: The operating system/layout is pretty good and I Iike it more than the old version of Android that I was using because it's more up-to-date (with some reserves which I'll list in a sec.)CONS:- Charging/Battery Life: Takes a long time for a full charge (and I agree with a previous reviewer--I'm not one of those paranoid people who always need a 90-100% battery--this takes a long time to charge up yet drains the battery at a fast rate.-Lack of a Menu Button on Front of Screen & Tiny Power/Volume Buttons: Coming from a Galaxy phone, I felt this lack immediately. Not having a Menu button gets frustrating. Again, I agree with a reviewer: not having a menu button forces apps to provide their own thus taking up real estate. Also, the power and volume buttons are barely there so I frequently have to look down to press them. Definitely not a deal-breaker but noticeable enough. I might overlook that after a while; who knows :)... That's it! Oh yeah the camera's great, but I'll need more time with it. Overall, the HTC One on Verizon is amazing. It's obvious HTC really cares about quality and I'd say this is the best Android phone out right now. Very happy--and thankful! of course--with my present this year :)Edit: Just a side note, I downloaded Go Launcher which has always been a favorite of mine because it's highly customizable. It solves the homescreen rotation issue and allows you to delete Blinkfeed as a screen.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever owned", "Author": "Taoshaman", "ReviewID": "R8JS0W0LIQDQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my fourth Android phone, and sixth smartphone.

The processor, gpu, and ram are all also on the nicer end for hardware, more than powerful enough for all common smartphone usages.My only real complaints would be that the battery life isn't great, probably comparable to an iPhone. Whereas the Maxx and Razr Maxx can last for 2 days without a charge, this needs to be charged daily with average use, maybe even in midday under heavier usage. Not terrible battery life, just not the best available.Also, the power button is a bit difficult to press. The top left corner is less accessible than the top right in my opinion for a right-handed user, and the button itself is very recessed and doesn't travel much when pressed. It's a minor complaint, but I've had the phone for a few weeks, and it's still tricky to press the power button, and there are user reports of it wearing out rather quickly. Especially with a case, it becomes even less accessible.For those interested in custom ROMs, recovery installations, and getting root, RumRunner lets you S-Off and then fastboot flash a recovery to gain root and flash ROMs. If unfamiliar with the process, XDA developers has more info on the process and its advantages, but it's probably not something the average user would care about,Overall, the HTC One is a very well made phone with a great screen and nice performance, and the only drawbacks for me are average battery life and a tricky power button.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased", "Author": "coffee hound", "ReviewID": "RL5NZ2J8833VW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a nice phone.

OK, it's not really \"possessed\" -- I don't think -- but at 2:30 am last night, it just started ringing on its own and wouldn't stop. I pressed the \"volume down\" button, and it kept ringing at the same volume. I went into \"Settings\" and put the sound on \"Silent,\" but it kept ringing. I checked all alarms, and there were none on. And here's the kicker -- I then powered the phone off, and it kept ringing! I wanted to remove the battery, but you can't on this phone. I then unplugged the charging cord, and after a few minutes, it stopped ringing. But as soon as I plugged the phone back in, it started ringing again even with the power off. With the power on, it kept ringing regardless of whether it was plugged in or not. I put the phone in my car to get it out of the house so I could try to sleep. I returned the phone to the retailer this morning as soon as the store opened, with the phone still ringing. The tech staff was amazed and had never seen anything like it. Luckily, I was still within my 14-day window, so I could return it for a full refund, rather than get another HTC One and hope for the best. I am not alone -- look it up online. Apparently there is a history of this happening with Droid DNA by HTC as well.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I hate it!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"jilleybeans\"", "ReviewID": "R1EWLE844Z51TT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is supposed to be so fast, it will not connect to the internet half of the time using wifi or data, it will process until it times out.  I thought I had 30 days (my fault, had I known I would have done this before, it's been crap since the first week) to return this junk but I only had 14 and I have had it for 27 days and I can't exchange it for a different phone without paying full price until they receive this phone and then will refund the difference.  I am so upset with HTC and Amazon.  I got the new phone because my old one was so terrible with the hopes of not having these worries but it is crap.  I have a bill pay app that backs up daily and I back it up manually once a week and this app and all of its information is gone and when I went to back it up, there was no backup information.  I have had this app for the last two years and never had this problem before. Once I figured out and was trying to put all of the info in and I was late on a bill and charged a late fee.  I hate it!  These two petty major (to me) problems and I am so unhappy.

Industry reporting indicates 44 percent of Android users are still using versions 2.3.3 through 2.3.7 - known as Gingerbread - which were released in 2011 and have a number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions. The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date.\"The bulletin proceeded to identify SMS Trojans, rootkits and fake Google Play domains as security threats and offered various mitigation strategies.For example, to fight against SMS Trojans it advised, \"Install an Android security suite designed to combat these threats. These security suites can be purchased or downloaded free from the Internet.\"To protect against fake domains, \"Install only approved applications and follow IT department procedures to update devices' OS. Users should install and regularly update antivirus software for Android devices to detect and remove any malicious applications.\"The IT industry and tech-savvy users have known about these types of security concerns - stemming from Android fragmentation, most mobile phone manufacturers' sloth and indifference, and user inertia and ignorance - for a while now. But apparently the DHS and FBI just noticed this summer. \u00b5", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "NULL", "Name": "HTC One M7, Silver 32GB (Verizon Wireless)", "ImgURL": "NULL", "ProductID": "B00EN68XJC"}}
