This phone finally looked promising combining a rugged design with solid performance. Its specifications are exactly what I wanted: a good processor, a lot of ram, decent battery runtime, microSD slot and even Ant+ support (for heart rate monitors etc.).I especially like the feeling that everything is well thought through, for instance the charging dock, to preserve the water protection of the USB port.Actually I planned to install a different system (CyanogenMod) on it directly, but I gave the Sony firmware a chance and even like it so much, that I'm going to stick with it for now.", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Gabi", "ReviewID": "R2E2FPYZP4WJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone, stylish, fast, great pictures under water. the apps are great.

Be sure you do a HARD RESET (Factory) after installing the update to get rid of the T-Mobile Mobile Network setting.  It will cause you problems on AT&T; with tethering assuming you have that provisioned on your plan (confirmed bug by Sony).Then the phone defaults for mobile networks are the wap.cingular APN  BUT ... If you go into settings and have it 'load carrier' settings you get the phone APN.  BUT ... it won't work (can't use phone APN) unless you have your Acro S provisioned by AT&T; as an iPhone device.  You might need an iPhone IMEI to do this.  It makes a huge difference using the phone APN vs. wap.cingular in speed.  I regularly see 5 Mbps during the day and have had 7-8 Mbps late evening.  Only got 2-3 Mbps (on average) using wap.cingular lucky to see 4 Mbps at night.My phone shows in my AT&T; account settings as:  DataPro 5GB for iPhone 4S Personal Hotspot", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent cell phone", "Author": "castillor", "ReviewID": "R3P9HE8T9NGFDM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was made \u200b\u200banxious to get this phone, to open the box and see it I liked its size because it is a cell phone not too big but it is small.

It can handle whatever I throw at it. Good reception and call quality. Music playback quality is excellent, even over Bluetooth. Nice camera for a smartphone. The screen is very clear, but it is LED and not AMOLED if that is what you're after. Jelly Bean update is coming soon, hopefully Sony won't mess it up. Sony integration with Android is not intrusive, which I like. There are some useful apps bundled with the phone but nothing super exciting. Walkman music player is good. May be the phone is a little bulky for some but I have no issues with that, and it is water proof. Included charging dock is a nice touch. Uses standard size Sim cards, can be more convenient in some cases.Some complaints:- smallish camera/power/volume buttons that can be difficult to operate- soft buttons take some getting used to, it's very easy to hit Home instead of the space key when typing in portrait mode which hides the app, annoying- one of the reasons I got this phone was the microSD support, however I'm not having much luck with it. I have 2 SanDisk cards one 64Gb and second is 16Gb, both would randomly unmount and/or generate write errors if saving photos to them. Yes I know 64Gb is not officially supported, but the 16Gb is, I don't exclude the possibility that the card is the culprit but it passes all read/write tests on my PC.- the body of the phone is not that drop proof, make sure to buy a protective case, speaking from experience, the phone took a light 1ft drop to a hard surface and sustained noticeable damage.- the screen is glass but has a factory-installed plastic shatter film that scratches easily, so you'll want to install a screen protector from day one.- aftermarket accessories for this phone are hard to find- unable to use the supplied charging dock when the phone is in a protective caseIf you're after a plastic protective jacket for this phone and don't plan to switch the Sim and microSD cards often I highly recommend the \"Melkco Poly Jacket TPU Case for Sony Xperia Acro S\". Very good quality and tight fit. What makes it especially good is that the plastic is nicely trimmed around the power/volume/camera buttons which makes it much easier to operate them. You may have to order it from outside the US. I had mine shipped from Hong Kong for $15 total.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent device", "Author": "geek451", "ReviewID": "R2AETZYA7NCAUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this device primarily as a replacement for my subsidized Motorola Droid 2 Global.  That device is off contract this month, and was looking for an unlocked GSM-Based device that I could run on Straighttalk or similar service in the US.  Important features for me were as follows:Unlocked GSM serviceUnlockable bootloader for potential customizationUSB OTGHigh quality displayHigh quality cameraBattery lifeSome sense of ruggednessI would say that it has lived up to my expectations thus far.  I love the Camera.  With average use, I am getting a bit more than a day out of the battery.  Sony needs to be commended on their approach to open development platforms.  They did provide the unlock code for the boot loader within the hour I requested it.  The skin they provide to the Android OS is lightweight by default.  While some feel the specs of this device are a bit behind, it has handled anything I have thrown at it.  The software runs well and I am please with the performance.  No lag or general slowdowns observed yet.While I like the device, it may not be for everyone.  I have larger hands and some people may feel the device it a little thicker.  I think that mostly has to do with IP57 water proof rating.  One complaint that I would have is that the waterproof doors do get in the way and are a tad annoying for any wireless peripherals, including headphones.  Luckily I have a nice bluetooth stereo headset.  Another item which could be considered a con, is that the volume rocker is lower than it might otherwise be.Everyone should also be aware that this phone is not yet compatible with TMobile's (or there MVNO's) 3G networks in most US locales.  I hear that T Mobile is in the process of migrating their 3G HSPA networks to the standard frequencies this device supports within the year.  Otherwise you would be stuck to 2G rates for data.Overall I would recommend this device to most people.  It has a premium feel and feature-set without the price tag of a premium unlocked device.  Between the display, camera, and what this device can save me a month (prepaid services  around $50/Month).  It will pay for itself rather quickly.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "Mikhail", "ReviewID": "R3TRZLW56ARR64", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone was a gift from my husband, and i love it.

Speaker phone volume is way too low , No removable battery ,but i knew that just didnt think it would be a pain in the rear when the phone freezes ,and it will freeze from time to time you can bet on that .I spent $100 on a Galaxy s3 from at&t; after rooting and installing custom os the Galaxy was clearly the better phone even before i rooted it . At&t; will recognize unlocked smart phones now so your going to pay the smartphone fee anyway might as well enjoy a better phone . Screen not as clear as one would think but still very clear . Kind of clunky in the hand maybe due to the sharp edges not being rounded or the back not being curved .If the phone goes dead from needing to be charged , when plugged in the phone turns on and off without charging over and over again until you get the phone turned on then plug the charger in , I have no clue whats up with that but i have an older SE Xperia Neo that does the same thing . NFC is only compatible with other Sony's so thats kinda worthless.I do like the water proof feature but thats about where it ends i have been a loyal Sony/ Ericsson customer since the SE 790a. I think im about done with Sony until they fix that annoying charging problem, start using removable batteries  and turn up the WORTHLESS speakerphone .APN settings you will need to input manually , the auto settings loaded into the phone via setup wizard for AT&T; are incorrect and will cause the internet connection to go in and out . Not a big issue just do a Google search for at&t; apn settings and you will find the correct settings.Battery life - You will need to plug the phone up at least once during the day from a full charge in the morning or it will be ready to die by early afternoon.Screen display is NOT gorilla glass! Sony uses a scratch resistant mineral glass so get a screen protector period ! I am very careful with my phones but i am starting to see small scratches in the screen . My 3 year old Nokia with Gorilla glass has no scratches and has never had a screen protector.Volume rocker is in a terrible spot you will wonder why Sony did this every time you need to turn the volume up or down.Reception is great i get a good signal almost everywhere without issue .Call quality is good but you will understand very quickly why i use my bluetooth headset all the time .Phone froze the first week with a full charge and i didnt know what to do so i called Sony for help. Sony quickly answered and instructed me how to do a reset . Press & hold power + volume up until it resets and it was fine after that .Anyway you have been warned .", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice hardware, subpar Android integration, awful Sony service", "Author": "NS", "ReviewID": "R202HE0AMBK5UK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First thing first - this is a review from a longtime iPhone user who wanted to get in the \"get control of your own device\" world. Judge this review accordingly.I wanted to get out of the iphone world as a matter of principle: I simply was tired of overpaying for the high storage versions of the iphone (yes, I DO need more than 16gb of storage on my device, and I DO want to be able to swap memory cards fast, without having to go through a computer). So the micro sD card slot on this phone was one of the main reasons for this purchase (made me skip that Lumia 920 I liked so much, as it comes without one). The water protection is a nice thing too. Any event:PROS (any of those can be reason to buy by itself):- Nice looking.- Beautiful screen. No, really. Beautiful.- Better antenna. One of the main reasons to get a new phone was that in my office, on my desk, coverage with my provider is really bad. Move 20 feet aside - it's ok. Get back at my desk - all hell breaks lose. Tried a colleague's iphone 5 - same stuff. Bad reception.With this Sony, reception is not perfect but way, way better. So if you actually want to use your phone as a phone...CONS:- First ordered from Sony, on Dec 19, overnight, to get it for Christmas. It was guaranteed to be at my doorstep on the 21st.On January 5, after being lied at my face one time too many from the Sony support line (\"yes, yes, it IS shipping tomorrow this time, but wait, actually not, it will ship in 4 business days, this time - for good !!!\"), I called it quits. Cancelled, ordered from Amazon overnight. Got it the next day. That will teach me. Amazon rules.- Email client is sub-par. This is a Sony, not an Android issue. As opposed to my Motorola Xoom tablet mail client, which looked just as ugly, but was able to consolidate Gmail and Exchange emails correctly, AND was giving me check boxes next to my emails by default for batch delete (very important for my usage), this client gives you the choice of either deleting emails one by one (Open email message / press and wait for \"delete\" to pop up / Press \"delete\" / Confirm \"Yes\"), or Menu key / Delete / select check boxes / press \"delete\" / confirm.This is light years behind the iOS mail client, which I thought is not that terrific till I tried this one. Might sound irrelevant, but for me the difference between swipe / delete  and getting through a gazillion steps procedure matters when I have to do it dozens of times per day.No, I can not test every email client available on Android till I find the right one. Not to mention they all look like lotus email for Win 3.1. Wonder who designed them.- Contacts: the Sony app sorta kinda managed to pull the emails from my iphone backup. Kudos for that. So here I am, with thousands of contacts (pretty much everyone I have ever exchanged an email with), in my phone list. Looking for an option \"Show only contacts with phone numbers\" ? I'm looking too. Apparently this has been taken off from Android for no apparent reason. Actually wait, there seems to be a reason after all: if you sync your contacts with your google account, you can manage them from there. Go ahead, folks, give them your contacts. It's not like they know anything about you yet, right ?Sony support's advice on that ? \"...Errr...download another dialer...\". Good work, folks !- Voice dialing: Had a \"Voice dialer\" icon in my menu. Updated to the latest android version as per Sony's suggestion - gone. Went into the apps settings menu - it is here, listed, but it takes 0.00 bytes of storage. Something tells me it's not there.Call to Sony support: \"...Sir, it depends of what software version you have. If it's not there, download a third party voice dialer...\".Really ? This Android thing is being heralded as the second larger thing since chocolate candies, as the \"big freedom OS\", but I have to give my contacts, my voice dialing habits, my everything to Google or some third party company I know nothing about ? Good one.- Because of the above, in its current state, this thing is useless and worse - dangerous in a car in its original state. I consider it NOT having voice dialing capabilities at all. No, I don't want to use google to voice dial, I don't want to teach it, I don't want Google to \"learn\" my voice habits after having almost forced me to sync my contacts with them.- Headset: That one was the one which came one too many, and the main reason I'm packing this things and returning them both to Amazon. The provided earbuds sound like tin cans banging each other, and comes with only a microphone and a button. NO VOLUME BUTTONS !!! It's 2013, and there's a phone company out there which sells a $600 phone (that's what it came at in the beginning), with $3.99 earbuds ! Which you actually need in order to use the FM radio !That one was the one that drove it down the ditch.Long story short:Compared to an iphone, this thing looks like an early Linux computer compared to mac OS: it is supposed to be better, it is nice to think it's faster, it is fancy to claim it's better than the other guy, but the time you spend making it work to your taste is time you have spend doing something productive on the other os. Thanks but no thanks.I have spent two full weeks giving this thing a chance. That's it. I am an IT guy, but this doesn't mean I have the time to recompile roms, root stuff and whatnot just to get it close to efficient. Doesn't mean I want to neither.Should this thing have had just the following:- \"Apple like\" email integration of Exchange and Gmail accounts (with swipe delete AND email and contact search on the Exchange server)- Simply working voice dial with decent car mode.- Favorites which allow you to call the contact with a press, not giving you more options when pressing- A decent pair of earbuds with at least the controls an iphone gives- A decent contacts control (with \"Show only contacts with phone numbers\" option)- Most important: Someone at customer support who knows to say anything else than \"I understand your problem and I am sorry you are having it\" in bad Hindi.I would have gladly used it.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Go for an iPhone", "Author": "Guido A Uzcategui P", "ReviewID": "R4MHJ8X1P91JZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm trying Android after several years with an iPhone (3G and 4)The screen has better size than the iPhone 4, not sure if you compare it to the 5.I'm not liking Android at all (ICS, still waiting Jelly Bean) iOS is much more easier to use, elegant and easier to set up.With all the problems that iTunes may have it is millions of times more capable to manage the phone and content than the Sony software.Good hardware quality and finishing.The camera is a POS compared to the iPhone 4.The battery is a joke, even compared to a 3 years old phone.I like the design and size much more than the Galaxy S3 and I don't need 4g because it's not available where I live.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$619.99", "Features": "Enjoy a movie evening with your friends, or dance the night away to party music.
