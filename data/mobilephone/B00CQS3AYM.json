And - wow!!!  The phone is so close to my Ipod 4 in size and design it's trippy and makes it feel oh, so familiar. And then, - well in all honesty on this phone, Google OWNS you, so you need to be prepared for doing everything through Goggle play.  But once you've gotten past that, the phone will knock your socks off.The actual browser button is so slow I'm not sure it works, but the Google search does, and quickly and there's also a pull down of different search engines and browsers - you can even Bing! although it still took me to Google play to download the app; if you really objected to that, I'm sure there's a work around.Apps download easy and quick, the screen is incredible; it's so small yet a Youtube video looks almost the same as it does on my Kindle, if not clearer!  IHeartradio sounds great, there are widgets to customize your screens and take you straight into things like settings - two more pages after \"home\" to add things to and apparently you can augment its 4 GB with a SD card up to 32 GB!Absolutely amazing phone experience - it even makes me glad the one I got was defunct, and makes me a lot less mad about the at least 8 hours I had to spend discovering it, changing them out, and dealing with Straightalk.  The phone features are good, intuitive and there's a ton of customization going on with it.  If you want to decline a call, you can pull up a menu and shoot back a reply from a quick menu of things like: \"I'm busy, will call you right back.\"Just all in all a ton of fun and a very interesting read on 4G Ice Cream Sandwhich if you want to Google more of what makes this phone unique.

Maier", "ReviewID": "R1DMBT90G0JWT8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was in a jam - I needed to port away from Sprint due to their horrible coverage, but I could not afford another Galaxy S series phone. So I purchased this phone using Straight Talk. Verizon Wireless coverage is good in my area, so it should have been a win/win situation... I just needed to adjust to an entry phone. I can do that, as the extra functions I used my higher-end phone for where more as a substitute for a tablet anyway.But there are some shortcomings worth mentioning that will matter to many people. One is the lack of a LED to indicate a missed call / message. Yes there appear to be LEDs there - but nobody is home. The NoLED app fixes this. The camera is basic, but dang - what do you/I expect. The sound quality of the music player is poor when using decent headphones, a non-issue for many, a breaker for others (I've tried different players - the problem is the electronics of the phone). However taking the positives into account (Android 4.xx, decent screen, good voice recognition, great battery life for an Android phone) I can deal with that.BUT what I can't deal with is the terrible reliability. Between friends and family, I have been involved in the purchase of 3 of these phones. One had a microphone failure within a day, and it's replacement failed 2 weeks later with another problem (was replaced with another model). Mine has become very erratic and shows gibberish on the lock screen, and I am facing a cumbersome replacement process. Only 1 of the 4 phones are still working correctly... as far as I know. Now we aren't talking about kids here - but adults over the age of 50 who take care of things.This is not a good reliability track record so far. Such a good phone for the price - but if it can't be trusted to work, is it a bargain or not?UPDATE: PLEASE READ - Samsung does not service/exchange this phone under warranty, you must contact Straight Talk for warranty service. Straight Talk is impossible. During my call to them, I was asked \"Does the phone make and receive calls?\" (Yes) \"Does the phone make and receive text messages?\" (Yes) \"Does the phone receive data?\" (Yes)... \"Then the phone is working... is there anything else I can help you with?\"Amazing, simply amazing. I understand that the carrier is often the provider for product warranty - but the carrier does not stand behind the warranty that they are under obligation to fulfill. I've had good luck with Samsung products, and view the problems with this model of phone as an exception. But Straight Talk is turning out to be even more of a problem here.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a lot of phone for the money...", "Author": "oyobass", "ReviewID": "R3QMH84FDNF70T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone for my wife as an anniversary gift, and wound up being a hero...

The battery life is a lot better than my last smart phone.I wish I had done some more research before purchasing this phone because I learned the hard way that it lacks some features that I had grown accustomed to on my last(more expensive) phone.1. The camera has NO adjustable focus, so close-ups may be blurry. Bar code scanner apps weren't able to get a crisp enough shot to work.2. No LED light, so no flash photography or flashlight apps for this phone.3. No internal compass. There are many apps that take advantage of the compass but since it doesn't exist in this phone, the apps won't work as well. I tried to go geo-caching with this phone the other day and was border line lost in the woods most of the time even with gps because deep in the woods on the winding paths neither me or my phone was able to keep track of which direction I was going or facing.There have been a couple times when the phone said I have no service when I was in a place that I know for a fact has service. Restarting the phone was required to get the service back on both occasions. It's like the internal cell radio became glitched or something.These \"missing\" features I mention might not even be things that other people even use and may make zero difference to you.Overall a good phone for the money so I give it 4 stars.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for the Price", "Author": "Sherry Covington", "ReviewID": "RNU0O1EUCUX7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone at Walmart just a few days after it came out.

A recent change to AT&T;'s gophone plans made me want to use a different provider. As a user coming from and an older model Iphone, I am quite pleased with this phone. Please understand that at the price point of 100 dollars, it will not compete with some of the higher end phones out now, but annihilates anything near its price.  The overall speed of the phone is acceptable, I feel like the 3gs ran a little bit more smoothly, but not by a significant margin. The gingerbread software works great, but I did not like how google + seems to dominate this phone as it is stock. Doing a little bit of research, and rooting the phone can take care of that. As far as the hardware involved, it seems to be decent.  The glass screen looks very nice.  It is bright, and clear. The resolution is not as high as the newer phones(same as 3gs), but for its small screen size by today's standards it still looks great. The camera is not great, but I prefer to use a real camera for serious pictures anyway. Its camera performance is similar to the 3gs. The physical build of the camera appears to be very good quality. It does not feel light, flimsy or cheap. Battery life is very good as well. From what we have covered, its almost like I have my 3gs still.  Now here is where everything changes. The Android software, for me, is a huge upgrade from apple. Now please understand, I am a mild techie, and and avid fan of Linux. Being able to modify the software in about any way is fantastic.  My phone OS, is trimmed up, neat, and powerful. It is fully customized for my uses now, and anything that I didn't like is gone. It is basically a mini computer now, filesystem, download manager, terminal commands, backup programs, 3rd power power management software, and no bloatware. It can pretty much do anything, and I am still just learning its capabilities.  My iphone was not stock either as it was unlocked with extra apps, but I just feel Android Gingerbread is a better platform.

Android 4.0, nice size factor for a device used primarily as a phone (I mostly use my tablet for web browsing, etc).  And a very reasonable price, especially when coupled with Straight Talk's $45/mo unlimited plan.  The negatives...slow, very limited internal memory and an internal \"emulated\" SD card.  The OS does not allow offloading (most) apps to your plug-in MicroSD, just data files.  I found I had to get rid of Google Music player to have control of where my music was stored to free up space, and also uninstalled some \"low priority\" apps to free up space.  All in all a fair tradeoff.  This is no Galaxy S4...but it doesn't cost $500 either.  Nor is it as big and bulky as an S4 or iPhone, it still fits comfortably in my back pocket.  It does have an internal GPS; I downloaded Co-pilot for \"disconnected\" navagation, and it works perfectly.  For someone that has a tablet and uses this as their \"secondary\" device for mobil web surfing, I think this is a good fit, especially if you have reasonable expectations.  If you're spending hours a day on it and it's your primary mobile device, not so much.My experience with Straight Talk customer service was only so-so.  I tried to transfer over my old Tracfone number...the web based service \"dropped\" me before the process was completed.  I called customer service and was told we were \"in the que\" and it might take up to two days to transfer the number and activate the phone.  I waited one day and decided \"screw it\" and got the new number, was up in about 10 minutes them.I'm happy with the phone and plan.  It met my expectations and is the lowest-cost approach for unlimited talk/text/data that I know of, that offers a decent-quality Android experience.  My Google Play account, apps and data purchased/set up on my tablet transfered to the phone perfectly (contacts/Kindle books, etc).  The most significant limitation is that teathering is not sllowed under Straight Talk's plans.  I was aware of that going in, so there were no surprises.  I'd give it a higher rating, based on my expectations; but again, it's no S4 or iPhone in terms of performance, don't want to make anyone think it is.

I have had three of these so far mainly because I have a problem with dropping them and they really don't like water.These are 3 G CDMA phones (there is no port for a SIM Card) and have the usual features that come with them: wifi, single front-facing camera (no flash), blue tooth, voice features, touchscreen, Android 4.XX, headphone with mic input though the new apple headphone's mic doesn't get recognized so you will have to use another brand with that feature.The time on this phone sometimes will change at random, tapping on the automatically detect time setting twice fixes it quickly and temporarily, some third party apps fix this completely, but for some who use this as an alarm clock it might be a deal breaker.The google driving directions app is kind of quirky on this phone compared to others, if you pass a road you were supposed to turn on it doesn't calculate a new route automatically, it sends you in one big circle to get back on that road you passed.  This can be fixed by exiting and re-clicking on your destination and it is possible 3rd party apps might fix this I haven't tried any others.Another quirk is that you cannot tether this phone to your laptop for internet connection sharing, some third party app may make this possible (I don't know), but by itself with just the software it comes with, it can't be done and seeing as it is straight talk this is likely intentional.Sometimes the phones freeze actually a lot of phones on the market freeze and these ones do more than most.  Even my iPhone 4S a while back did this, for me its a non-issue.Overall, it's okay, it has a number of quirks that might be a problem, but it's also laden with features not on your standard cheapo phone.

In that time you might mistakenly think that the phone is not responding, and you might attempt the call again.  Sooner or later it will make two calls to the same person.  The phone may be in your pocket by then.  To read an email it sometimes take 5 attempts to open it.  Messages are fine as long as they don't have an attachment.

I wanted something similar to my Samsung Nexus S 4G so I read many reviews about numerous phones on several websites. This one came very close to the Nexus and, after a few months use, actually performs, in almost all cases, better. I rarely use my phone to surf the web, only on occasion to check something in a hurry if I need to but when used it has done well. Mostly I use this phone for talking, texting, and for sure to access personal and business email when away from home and office. The one thing I do appreciate with this phone is no excessive initial bloatware that demands juice and drains my battery. That said, there is a lot that can be done to customize it to your taste and use. As it is an Android 4, Ice Cream Sandwich, you can get pretty much anything you want from Google Play. The music playing feature is not that great, better than some, worse than others, but I don\u2019t use it for that. Likewise, for me, the camera (3mp) is okay if I just want a quick snap of something and my DSLR is packed away. I rate this on connectivity, which, for me has been excellent. Not one dropped call. Sound quality when talking has been superb. Likewise, connecting to the network and placing calls. Text messages seem to arrive in an instant. The email synch is great. I have 4 different emails connected to it. The touch screen is not too sensitive and operates great for me. The 3.5\u201d screen is a good size, but may be slightly small for some. And, if needed, there is a micro-SD slot. The one little quirk I have experienced (twice in 4+ months) is that, for no reason at all, my clock went bonkers. My digital read-out lost 5 hours, both times. Easy fix by rebooting, but strange nonetheless. Other than that, this is a very good phone. I generally get 3, sometimes 4, days before recharging.
