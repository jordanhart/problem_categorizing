{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfomance Powerhouse with Sophisticated Functionality", "Author": "BottomLine", "ReviewID": "R21VYW8DIM181M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The GT-i9305 is truly a performance powerhouse. This phone is in a class of it's own, unmatched by any other to date. Why? Several reasons, the first being hardware. There are several variants of this phone, each with their own configuration of hardware. This particular model, the GT-i9305, brought them all together in one phone while adding LTE support. Like any PC running software, hardware matters most with regard to performance. That said, this is also true for smartphones as well. This particular version has a quad core CPU coupled with 2 gigs of ram. That's more than enough power 'under the hood' to handle anything you throw at it, namely the superior functionality of Android Jelly Bean v4.1.1 that comes stock.Not only does it run this operating system quite effortlessly, multitasking flawlessly along with Touchwiz is a sight to behold. The user interface is absolutely astonishing. This amazing display features a high definition 720p super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen utilizing Corning's Gorilla Glass 2. Blacks are truly 'black' and colors vibrantly 'pop' making for a beautiful viewing experience. Whether it's gaming, taking pictures, recording 1080p video, watching movies, running various apps, or surfing the web. hardware like this truly makes a huge difference in terms of quality and performance.Battery life, unless your using this all day viewing movies, videos, music, gaming..etc, it should last an entire day. However, this phone isn't short on possibilities either. If battery life is an issue, it takes all of 10 seconds to replace the battery with a fully charged spare. Another factor worth mentioning is the ability to add additional memory up to 64 gigs by mounting a micro-SD card, again, takes all of 10 seconds.I've read the negative reviews on the Galaxy s3, most of them were in regard to dropping the phone and the screen shattering. This is true for any smartphone under various conditions. Certainly accidents happen so it's always good to take safety precautions like using an otterbox. Using a nice case also addresses another issue people complain about, the build quality. I've read it feels plastic. Throw a nice case on and problem solved. Personally, I think the build quality is outstanding with great attention to detail, rounded corners, and ever so slightly curves giving the phone another five stars for aesthetics.One other issue I've heard is the phone is too big. This is utter nonsense, really? I highly doubt they even held one in their hand. Anyone can handle this phone with ease. The only thing too big about this phone is it's massive functionality, enhanced feature rich customizing ability, and truly awe inspiring ZERO LAG performance! Put this phone in the hands of anyone for a few days and I seriously doubt they would go back to anything smaller no matter the manufacturer, performance, reputation, and superior marketing strategies. You have to think, this phone is the most sought after, must have, number one, best selling phone in the world today for good reason. Size, shape, and fell being one of them.The only drawback to this particular model is that it is an unlocked international version with remarkable LTE on a quad core smartphone. If your living in the U.S. it will only work on a GSM Carrier utilizing a micro-SIM, another 10 second installation, to have functionality. By the way, it does send and recieves calls very nicely with outstanding sound quality. Although you may never achieve 4G speeds, this in no way diminishes this phone in any way whatsoever. More than likely you will be using your private or public WIFI for data anyway. When you do need data on the go for various reasons, you will still have data speeds that will satisfy your needs.One last thing to mention, the Samsung brand is second to none when it comes to seamless integration and synchronization of various media platforms such as televisions, computers, smartphones, and the like with ease via wire or wireless WIFI. I would be awestruck if anyone could possibly utilize the many different features and variations possible with such devices. The Galaxy S3 GT-i9305 is no acception. It makes light work of synchronizing the peripheral devices. Having played around with it, I realized the possibilities of taking advantage of all the features of this incredible device are virtually unlimited.I would have compared it to it's top competitor, but seriously, who walks around with 2 phones comparing them side by side every single day? When it comes to the remarkable hardware, detailed attention to style, and the endless possibilities of its functionality...this phone has got it all. You will never find a better smartphone with more sophisticated features than this Samsung Galaxy S3 GT-i9305.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best smartphone !!!!", "Author": "JOSE MORINIGO \"Waly\"", "ReviewID": "R3MAVL92XAUZPO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is very fast, hardly any lag whatsoever and run games and aplications smoothly. battery lasts a full day with normal use.

L. Augusto \"Sectoid\"", "ReviewID": "R31IQCJJBFMTMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll not cover the phone features here because a lot of other reviews cover this. I'll just warn you that the phone may not be factory unlocked as advertised. Also, I confirm that it's the i9305, with a quad-core processor and 2GBs of RAM.I bought this phone expecting what the title said, \"factory unlocked\". I even asked the seller beforehand if it indeed was, as I read a review that warned about it not being so. The seller confirmed it was factory unlocked without any carrier logo, but as it arrived, it was an orange carrier phone, with the expected bloatware and even an altered browser (which I'm skeptical to use, so I use chrome). Most of the bloatware cannot be removed without changing the firmware, but there's a way to disable it if you know which programs to look for (please tell me if you do!).The seller, FGS Trading, claimed that was not to be expected from their distributors and promptly offered a full refund plus payment for shipping charges to send it back. Also, their after-sales communication was really good, so overall I rated the store positively, even with this problem. I also chose to keep the phone, as I'm in Brazil now and I need it. Maybe when Samsung releases a software update, I can get rid of the bloatware.Bottomline: if you care about it being factory-unlocked, be prepared that it may not be or consider buying at a local store where you can see what you're getting.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware: French Galaxy", "Author": "Soul", "ReviewID": "R3202D4WRBG7SX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone works internationally but it is not the original international edition.

Just i have one thing to say. The seller sell the phone as factory unlocked. In my opinion factory unlocked means factory unlocked and not by software. If you buy a factory unlocked cel phone means the cel phone has the samsung logo and nothing else. This cel has a telekom logo from germany, it means that cel was unlocked by software and it is not a factory unlocked cel.

Nagll \"fitness freak\"", "ReviewID": "R2J4NNC2NBXGOU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this baby for about 4 weeks now. Features are great. Bluetooth is excellent. Network connection excellent. Touch sensitivity of the screen and clarity is awesome. Stability of the software as well. The only thing that keeps annoying the crap out of me is the battery life. So much that I regret getting it. Unfortunately, I bought it in the United Arab Emirates, where return policies for electronics is pure fiction.I am only running Skype and Google Talk in addition to the standard programs, and the maximum stand-by time I am able to achieve (e.g. with no use whatsoever) is just 11 hours. That is with both wi-fi and mobile data active. For someone who travels frequently and works long hours, this is far from good enough as a portable mobile work-horse!In comparison, the Blackberry BOLD 9900 my employer has supplied me with (which was known for poor battery capacity compared to earlier blackberry versions) lasts at least 18 hours. And the Galaxy Note was using before (I gave it to my wife when I bought the S3 LTE - big regret) held it up for at least 24 hours on standby. And the Galaxy Tab 2 7' (which gave to my mum, expecting that the S3 would be enough) lasted an amazing two days (wi-fi only).I am now considering getting the Note 2, without LTE.
