A good phone for the price.  Has two SIM cards and a microSD slot.  Not all singing and dancing but delivers on what it promises.*** UPDATE ***After purchasing and using this phone for a week, I started getting reports from folks on the other end of my calls that there was a loud static/buzz/interference on their end.  Unable to resolve the issue with the vendor, I purchased a second unit here on Amazon, but it exhibited the same problem.  The problem is quite bad to the party on the receiving end.  Based on this issue. I cannot recommend this model.  I have had a BL\u00dc phone before this one, and I carry a BL\u00dc phone now, so this is not a condemnation of all BL\u00dc phones, merely this model.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good buy", "Author": "Mary Collins", "ReviewID": "R23KW6AGOKANZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this phone for our daughter to use while living in Paraguay for 11 months.
