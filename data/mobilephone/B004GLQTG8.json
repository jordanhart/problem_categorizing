I can't comment on the browser features since for some reason the phone is roaming in the Wyoming area where I am located and it says data restriction 36 but from videos the browser is nothing special.It is also worth mentioning that you can record your own ringtones and transfer audio and images back and forth from your computer via a data cable or blue tooth adapter. Picture quality is better then my old 1.3MP camera which was a scoop but it's still nothing amazing, I'm sure everyone has seen what most cell phone pictures are like, and this phone is no exception, but still it is nice to have the feature.Also you can lock the keypad by pressing and holding the spacebar down.Features aren't great but you can get around 300 minutes or about 1200 text for 20$ per month on this phone which is very cheap for those of us who don't talk much.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thank you SO MUCH for this great deal!", "Author": "Mrs. F \"GdlyWom\"", "ReviewID": "R3R27NTR7N5O65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After recently becoming one of America's newest smartphone customers, I was going to pass my pristine Samsung A797 Flight Red At&t; Qwerty Keyboard Touch Screen 3g Gps Cell Phone to my youngest daughter until I saw this phone listed on Amazon.com.First off, the deal is crazy.

You cannot watch YouTube videos, but you can use your mp3's for ringtones, something that too many contract (read: expensive) phones still won't allow you to do! The calls themselves come in clear.

This is a Solid phone when it comes to net10 pay as you go phones and I have had a number of net10 phones over the years. I have seen some reviews on other prepaid phones and see the compliants about the browser speed. This is not an Android phone, if it's speed you want, buy an android, if it's just a basic Talk and text phone, then this is the type of phone to buy. This phone is a CDMA phone, it doesn't have a SIM card in it. I have read in an online forum that this phone actually uses the Verizon Towers so the signal is carried by them. I have had no signal problems thus far with this phone no matter where I have been in my area, though there are different factors that can come into play when it comes to cellphone signal strengths and weakness's. The keyboard on this phone is easy to navigate, I do wish they had made the keys just a tiny bit larger but it is not a deal breaker as I have adapted to it and it's not an issue for me. There are several other functions with this phone, one of my Favorties is the Tip calculator, I'm admittedly lousy at math, it's handy to have! There is a Memo pad, another handy tool to have to write a note to save, Remember, a note...not a book. It has a calendar as well as a calculator, it also has a camera, again, this is a prepaid phone camera, don't expect over the top pictures, but they afre not bad at all...for this type of phone.

Granted, it's not top quality but considering that it only costs $9.99, this phone is certainly worth the purchase, that is if you're looking for basic phone use (i.e. making phone calls, texting, as well as using the calendar, calculator, alarm etc.).  However, if you want a phone that includes a fast internet connection, a camera that takes quality pictures, or video recording ability, you should look elsewhere. As for me, I'm happy with this phone so far and I'm also happy with Amazon. As usual Amazon delivered on time and the merchandise was in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon :-DHere is what I've experienced & observed so far:BATTERY POWER: I tested the phone out a lot during the first few days. In other words, heavy usage. It took a little over 2 days before I had to recharge the battery. Then when I hardly used the phone (just a few short calls and several texting), the battery lasted for 5-6 days before I had to recharge. As of now, I'm happy with the battery. I just hope it'll stay this strong for a while.CALL RECEPTION: Solid reception. I can hear the person on the other end clearly and vice versa. With regard to dropped calls, I have not had one yet.CAMERA: Pictures aren't the best quality but they come out good enough. Unfortunately, there's no zoom which is a huge bummer for me since I'm a frequent user of the zoom feature. However, there are other features which make taking pictures fun, such as the series shot; mosaic shot; and my favorite, fun frames. For me that makes up a little for the quality of the pics.INTERNET ACCESS: This feature is ok for occasional use. However if you're looking for a phone mostly for internet browsing (if you internet daily for hours), you may want to look around and see what other choices are out there. As for this Samsung r355c phone, it's 10 cents a minute to internet; and be aware that the first minute will be deducted as soon as you press the browser key. The downloading of website pages is a bit slow to complete. I could not browse or navigate through any site until the downloading completely finished. I got 2 minutes deducted, once, for just visiting one page w/o hardly reading anything. If you do get this phone, this feature is not too bad if you have the time to wait for pages to download.KEYPAD:1). The key buttons are really small which worried me a bit because my fingers are medium sized and I keep my nails really short so I thought I'd have problems (i.e. pressing 2 keys at once or pressing the wrong keys). Surprisingly I've had no trouble typing. It's pretty easy.2). When not using the phone, it's best to lock the keypad down by holding down the space key for a few seconds. When the keypad is unlocked, it's easy to accidentally hit the browser key unknowingly and be charged for every minute the browser is on.3). Fyi the red \"End pwr\" key is the \"home\" key. I didn't know that until I read the instruction booklet a few days later. I kept pressing the \"back\" key a few times to get out of features like the camera mode, text messages, calendar, etc. just to get back to the home screen. Doh!SPEAKER: The clarity is excellent. MUCH clearer than my 2 laptops' speakers that's for sure.TEXT MSG: It was nice to find out it only costs 2 &1/2 cents (0.25 minutes) per text compared to the 10 cents (1.00 minute) I used to pay prior to switching to this phone. I also like that there's a character count which lets you know when you're about to hit the maximum (160 character per text). The one thing missing is the copy/cut/paste features. But it's a minor issue considering the price of this phone.TEXT PICTURE MSG: It cost 35 cents (3.50 minutes) to send & to receive a picture text message. I was a little bummed about that but oh well, it's still good.VIDEO RECORDER: there is none :-(I know I'm leaving out info about other features this phone offers, but hopefully what I already have written down will help some people decide whether or not this phone will suit their needs.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little phone", "Author": "Hanna Hach", "ReviewID": "R3COVQJH6E8W4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want a no nonsense kind of phone that works reliably and you don't have to charge it every single day, get this phone!", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great basic phone", "Author": "E.H.", "ReviewID": "R3L83O3VDXUKCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read all the good reviews on this phone and the price was right so I ordered it.

My unlocked HP Pre 3 messed up and I saw this for only $9.99 FREE PRIME shipping. It was a steal.This phone is exactly what I needed. It has features many basic phones don't have nowadays. Things like a dedicated camera button, a cover for the USB charging port to avoid dust getting in and a standard headset jack. The menu is very basic, nothing out of the ordinary, easy to read. As far as the network goes, I did some research and after activating this phone I am certain the networks got switched from T-Mobile to Verizon Wireless coverage. This phone runs on Verizon's CDMA 1X network. Which is also a big plus for me because I have better signal and I'm saving $5 with Net10 over Verizon's Unlimited for basic phones plan. Very happy with my purchase. The only negative thing I would point out is the keyboard itself feels really cheap. It has good tactile feedback but you can definitely feel the cheapness of it. I don't really mind as long as I can text fast on it. Which I think is achievable once I get used to the keyboard. If this phone messes up I can always get a second one.

Beforehand, I owned the Motorola flip phone, under Net10. Paid $30 for that, it was great as a starter for my first cell phone, paid for by myself. When my mom was paying my bill, I had the LG900G and it was great, loved the feel, the keyboard, all the little gadgets; absolutely awesome.I decided to shop around for an upgrade, something a little more my speed than a flip phone. After seeing this phone, I read all the reviews because I wanted to make sure I was getting the bang for my buck, even if it was only $10 ($16 & change because of shipping) and I decided that between this and the Net10 with the slide up keyboard, that this phone was the better deal.I've had it for two days now, transferring my number took five minutes online and then another 10-15 minutes with the phone physically. Quick, easy, and done in less than a half hour. I love the feel of the keys (I have tiny hands, so it works well with me) and it can do a lot for the price.Bought a case too, which should arrive to my house today, which I also paid $10 ($5 for the case, $4.95 shipping.) In total, I bought a brand new phone and a brand new case for $26.91, under the price I paid for the flip phone without a case ($30) and I'm very satisfied so far.I'll update if anything changes, but so far, it fits all of my needs.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better Than Expected", "Author": "J.

The phone clarity was great, texting was easy for me, alarm clock worked fine, all the things I really needed it for.  It has a good speakerphone.The camera is not that great, because there is no zoom, etc.  No extra features. You can't even enlarge it at all when someone sends a pic message.  Sometimes you have to ask them what it is a photo of. That is the state of this camera. (the LG900g has a nice camera).The browser, well, it's a browser.  Not a smartphone.  You definitely can check email and news, sports, whatever you want.  It is slow, though, and not a computer experience.  But it does work and you can indeed get your Internet fix if you have to.As a phone, as a texter, as an alarm clock, as a calculator, etc., it is wonderful.  I was really sad to lose my first one and really happy to find another one here at this price.*** UPDATE ****  The first one I received now was DOA.  Not sure if battery or phone itself.  Ordered a replacement for it, and now this one is shutting itself off after a few minutes.  I need to return both.  Should I try this model again?  I don't know...

Don't expect Internet access, Facebook, etc, with this thing.My friends mostly have phones costing 2-4 times this much per month (I use the $25/month 750 minute plan). But their phones don't work in buildings, elevators, on the subway, etc., and mine does. It seems that Net10 rents working wireless access from expensive companies and then sells it to us.I have purchased 3 of these phones. One was defective enough to return it, and a second one refuses to go into autolock mode, so I often find it browsing the net or writing its own text messages. To my knowledge it has never actually butt-dialed anyone. I can lock it by just holding down the spacebar, but I often forget. It has never managed to use up my minutes, anyway.A fourth Net10 phone also died before I started with these Samsungs. So why do I give them 5 stars? Because they are practically giving these phones away, and the per month charge is reasonable by US standards.The only reason I don't get yet another phone and dump my slightly defective one is that I'll have to type in about 300 digits to reprogram the new phone to take over my account.As far as usability, the phone is great. The keyboard is fine, even though the keys are tiny and I can barely see them without glasses, it is miles better than my previous 'cheap' phones, which cost much more than these.

However it Is not without A few aggravating features. The keyboard is small, as others have mentioned, so if you have large fingers it might not suit you. Also, there is now way of deactivating the browser that I am aware of and believe me I've looked for one. The browser is a one button push, and the only defense from doing this is to lock the keyboard by holding down the space button, which I forget to do sometimes. I just learned you can set the phone to lock the keyboard after a time of inactivity, in case you forget to lock it like I do.I was skeptical that this phone only charged you .25 minutes a text that another reviewer mentioned but sure enough it does, although I just noticed it also charges you 1 minute a call whether the person you are calling answers or not, which to the best of my knowledge doesn't happen with other net 10 phones.The mp3 player is a nice feature and can use up to 16 GB of ...which is quite a lot of music.Can't comment too much about the camera save for the fact you cannot zoom in after you snap a photo.Speaker is on par with other cheap phones.I would suggest this phone to anyone who has small fingers that likes to text, additionally they have a very similar phone at Kroger grocery store at the moment if you want to get an idea of the keyboard size.

First two were AT&T; phones, lots not to like about AT&T; in southwest CT (IMHO), so I made sure this is Verizon, and it is! (G at the end of the name indicates AT&T;, C means Verizon.)Most important functionality for me is good coverage (Verizon), good voice commands (reliable Bluetooth) and decent texting ability (not bad on this device).My first phone (Samsung T401G) was a slider, which really does beat the fakeBerry style phone for texting, but the phone had no voice dialing, so Bluetooth was not fully functional. Scratch that.My second phone was a Samsung R455G (AT&T;). It looked much like this phone and was actually heftier, nicer casing, a kind of mini-track pad for moving the cursor. It looked more like the $40 I paid rather than this $10 phone. BUT, the Bluetooth was the weirdest I've ever encountered (I wrote a review on Amazon), and any time you hit the space bar when texting, you were equally likely to get a period. So you. Would get. Sentences. Like this. Scratch that.So, with the R355C I get Verizon connectivity, a NORMAL fully-functional Bluetooth, and the ability to text relatively easily. I actually find typing on the fakeBerry much easier than I would have thought. The worst is all the overlays (for punctuation and things like $ / etc.), which, if you have started losing your fine eyesight as I have, is murder, because it's very hard to see what's on each key. I suppose over the life of the phone I will get used to the most common things I use, but while the phone is new it's a bit of a drag. Not the phone's fault.Unlike some phones with exposed buttons (like the R455G), this phone does not lock itself every time it goes dark, which is a feature I actually like. You can easily lock it (hold the space bar) before putting it in your purse, but if it's sitting on your desk, it doesn't lock up every time it goes dormant, which is great if you're in the midst of a somewhat sporadic text exchange. Somewhat unusually, to unlock the phone you press a soft key and the space bar rather than the center or \"ok\" button, which seems the more common configuration.Haven't had it long enough to comment on battery life, but it seems better than the 455, which had terrible battery life.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall, a solid performer", "Author": "Joel", "ReviewID": "R2ZARUVZRBP4GE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you want just talk n text on verizon consider this phone.

There is a speakerphone button above the send button.  Also, text messages are 1.00 minute for outgoing and receiving.  Buttons are small but easy to get used to.  The only drawback about the actual phone is that you cannot customize any of the shortcut buttons.

Oh, what I would give to have that phone back!My main complaint about this phone is that whoever designed it didn't give too much thought to usability/ease of use. In the Web design world, there is a general rule that a user should never have to click more than twice to get to any page on a site. The developer of this phone certainly did not have that rule in mind. I may be missing it, but I have not been able to find a speaker function on this phone. That means I can't drive while using it (no Bluetooth feature either) and I can't use the speaker when I am typing and making business calls. The phone often has to be reset because the clock stops or the date is wrong.The keyboard is also kind of weird. I thought you could use the shift button to switch from letters to numbers, but you can't. You have to click 123/sym, write out the number, and then go back to Abc/abc to write the rest of a message. This is a pain in the butt if you are trying to write several numbers in a message, as you have to keep switching between 123/sym and Abc/abc.

I bought this as a cheap efficient way to make and receive important calls. Unfortunately it\u2019s never worked. Out of the box, the phone proved incapable of keeping a charge longer than one day. What\u2019s more is that after a painstaking activation; I say this because after registering the product on Net 10\u2019s website the phone still didn\u2019t work. I had to call Net 10 from a land line so that a customer service representative could walk me through the process of putting in about 8 to 10 activation codes. After this, the phone couldn\u2019t receive a signal\u2026 almost anywhere. In a very few locations we were able to make calls, but nowhere that it actually counted. It wouldn\u2019t even work at our home whereas we\u2019ve had AT&T; and Verizon phones which work just fine. After calling Net 10 again, the customer service representative deduced that the produce was defective and that they would send a new phone. I was fine with this even putting aside that we\u2019d had the produce well over a month and never got to use it. After repeating the home address to the representative three times, he still got it wrong. The package ended up at a FedEx several miles away and they couldn\u2019t resend the package. So, I called Net 10 yet again to explain the problem to them. They said that they\u2019d send another phone and never did. Instead they cancelled my service with them which is just fine as I would\u2019ve done that anyway. The bottom line is that I gave this item three stars out of grace. I assume that if you get a working product there will be no problem, but be forewarned that costumer service is terrible should you have an actual problem.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just one thing wrong", "Author": "bootz", "ReviewID": "R41QQ5R9YU77Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was really excited when i received this phone so when i opened it i discovered that the battery did NOT go with this phone so i called the net 10 co and told them about a problem with a product and they sent me out a new battery and when i received it, it was still the wrong battery so i instantly became angered so now i am trying to find the CORRECT battery.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "I don't know how this phone works......", "Author": "HD Rider \"HD Rider\"", "ReviewID": "R3OVNVBBA29PTH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "....because I was unable to activate it.
