{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I really was reluctant to purchase a Samsung device but then all that changed", "Author": "Critical Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R2Y8K2F9UZWGSD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All right here is an honest review about the note 3. It's something that I will approach from the perspective of someone in the Medical field, who needs to get things done quickly, and efficiently.First of all, I received my phone on October 10th, and I had pre-ordered it but DID NOT pay 299. Well initially I did, but there is a promo code of VERIZON30 that drops the note 3 down to 209.99. I bought the Note 3 for myself and the LG G2 for my wife. Needless to say, at the price of 139.99 for the G2 and 209.99 for the Note 3, we returned the G2 for the note 3 despite the G2's incredible low light camera performance. Here is why.Backstory: prior to buying the note 3 I have had the Droid Razr Maxx, which for its time was a great device. Now that apps are becoming more memory intensive, something needed to change. I needed a phone that wouldn't lag on me, and I really don't care about gimmicks such as scrolling while looking up or down, or pausing a video if I look away. Who really cares about that stuff? If I want to pause, I tap on the screen, which is less time consuming that looking away and ensuring my phone has paused playing a video. In addition, I really don't want that front facing camera on unless I am using it. Also, I was always reluctant to buy a Samsung phone because of the plastic build, but you know I always keep my phone in a safe case. I will talk about this a little later.Now, right before I let go of my razr maxx, I briefly upgraded to the note 2 for 2 days. I chose the note 2 because I was in best buy and was comparing the HTC ONE which best buy had on sale for $50 and all of a sudden I decided to listen to the note 2's speaker. I was blown away in comparison to the razr maxx, but blown away which how much more I got in comparison to the HTC one. We are all going to large screens now, and frankly who the heck wants to hold the phone closer to their face? I certainly don't so I upgraded to the note 2. I really did not fall in love with it until the day I was sitting in my senior human cadaver anatomy course, and realized I had forgotten my Anatomy atlas and my notebook. I frantically searched the note 2 and found an app called S Note. I opened S note and began using it. I was blow away, there are blood vessels that are large and really thing, and I used to be able to only differentiate that on paper. Not this time, with the note 2 I was able to use the thin and thick lines as differentiators thanks to the S-pen. I then made my decision that I would return the note 2 and wait for the note 3 because of the larger screen, and faster processor. In addition, I had a memory intensive Anatomy app running on the note 2 that smoothly ran it, when my HP touchpad running android decided to begin hiccupping.Now with all that said, this is why I feel the note 3 is the best choice on the market. First of all, if your going to purchase a phone that you are spending your hard earned money on it, it should be in the most secure and safest cases. It's an investment, that when 2 years later you sell back, you can almost pay for your new device. Second of all, we will ALL drop our phones at SOME POINT, and its important to protect them. I purchased the Spigen Bounce case despite it being slightly ugly; I got the gray one because Incipio NGP tpu cases are NOT yet available for this phone. That case kept my razr maxx in like new condition.Now, I really protect my phone because I have my entire life on it, my class schedule, my hospital schedule, my family schedule, my kids doctors appointments, my appointments, my tests etc. EVERYTHING. So I needed a phone that was behind me 100% and never let me down. It has been the case with the note 3. I have customized it and it still hasn't hiccupped yet.Now the actual review:Screen & Productivity: The large display is fantastic. It is large enough to hold a full month calendar on one home screen and 3 days on another. I absolutely love the vivid screen because my anatomy apps, as well as using it to take notes is an absolute breeze. My only recommendation is to add many pages before you begin in lecture or whatever you want to take notes in.There are many times where I find inspirational quotes on Facebook (FB) and wish I could save them and tag them to share not via FB but text messages etc. Scrap book has allowed me to do just that, I can share inspirational quotes and pictures with anyone and it's a breeze to look them up by placing my OWN PERSONAL tags for each photo. I hold the menu button, type inspiration and BAM; I have all my things that are tagged inspirational.Sometimes I also need a list of diagnostic medical conditions, and it's easy to quickly create a scrapbook memo or create a flow chart in S-note. Etc. In fact the other day, I was talking to Verizon and needed to write down the conformational code etc. for my second note 3, and you know what I did? I was on the dialer page, pulled out the S-pen and circled the page, then I notated it with all the information, it contains the date, the time, and all the information I need to have in case something went awry.I absolutely love this feature and it is very important.Another feature I love is that when I am on YouTube, I can load HD very quickly, the LG g2 did a good job in this too, but the razr maxx despite being an LTE phone did not handle this very well. Another thing I really love on this phone straight out of the gate is that it tells me how many text messages I have (like an unread count). Its something I like, it also has many accounts built right in, such as amazon, Facebook etc. I was able to disable most of the bloat ware by going to manage applications and clicking disable in some of the pre-loaded Verizon apps.The IR blaster is great, I've already started using it on all my TV's however, it wont turn the volume up on my LG TV but do every else. In addition, I am able to have in memory which room has which TV and so when I switch rooms, I also switch rooms on my phone, which allows me to use it as a remote. Great when you have to hide the remote from your little ones.Battery Life: Used it for an entire day hardcore, and its still at 31% at the end of the day after about 6 am to 1 am usage.UPDATE 10.23.13- see the attached screen shot of battery usage. I was pretty impressed. I do know for a fact though that S- health eats battery life like crazy.Also I LOVE the speaker placement on the bottom of the phone, because it's just smart. When I hold my phone, it cups around the speaker channeling the sound directly to me, and not the entire audience behind my phone. Smart.People have complained about the flip board app, but keep in mind, this is android and not IOS. We have choices here. Download an app called home 2 shortcut and it allowed me to configure double tapping the home button to start Google now rather than anything else. Its fantastic and a great use of android capabilities.(I will update more here)The S-pen I received was faulty with my phone, and so Verizon sent me a brand new one for free. Not taking off stars for that, during the pre-order stage stuff like that happens every once in a while. The Spen was completely usable I just had to add a little extra pressure. But no worries, it's taken care of and all is well.The power button has a slight lag when you just tap it to turn on the screen; if you give it a robust tap it comes on quicker. It is quickest to turn on the screen using the home button when it's sleeping. It kind of irritates me that it is that way.NOTE 10.23.13 It maybe quicker to use the HOME button to do the same thing.I wish Samsung allowed customization of the LED colors for the types of notifications.Note 10.23.13 Re: reception issues- I know people have complained about reception issues, but truly I haven't had many. Just a couple here and there. I think the reality is that the Note 3 is SLOW at switching networks etc. So rather than wait, I have just downloaded a refresh network app, which does what I need in less than 15 seconds and gives me a fresh connection. I don't see it as much of an inconvenience especially because the many positives of this device outweigh this one negative. I haven't had no reception anywhere.Tethering by the has been pretty amazingly fast with this phone, and it DOES NOT GET HOT!!!! I love that! My razr maxx used to be a meteorite when it was tethering.More to come.UPDATE 12.13.13I apologize it has been a while to update. I absolutely still love this phone, and I wouldnt change much about my review. I will say that I have experience reception issues but they are SOOO SELDOM, I believe ive refreshed the network about 4-5 times since I have wrote the initial review and now.Ive been informed that there IS an app that allows you to customize the colors of the LED to what you want. Excellent, so thats definitely a negative taken away.I had been using my phone with a Spigen screen protector and initially I liked it, but now with using the S-pen and it aging I really am beginning to dislike that screen protector. I have just ordered a tempered glass screen protector and will update later about that.ONE thing I have learned is to save EVERYTHING from action memo to Scrapbook or S-Note if you want to hold onto it in case your phone needs to be reset. I had to reset my phone once, but it was due to the FoxFi app and it causing certificate issues. Once I reset it it fixed it.Another note, the Spigen case protector I was talking about, it is great, however I have found that the squared edges make it uncomfortable for my hand to hold, when I remove the case I can handle the phone pretty easily with one hand (even though I have hands on the smaller side). So I have ordered a case that has rounded edges rather than squared edges.Whatever you do, do NOT get a metal case for your phone because it will reduce your signal quality.Other than that the phone has been running great, and I will update it again soon!", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Great Battery Life, Ignore 1 star review", "Author": "Jeeper", "ReviewID": "R383UG6IQ1KMCI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Galaxy Note 3 is a great phone with great battery life and features.  The screen is big and beautiful, the apps and features are great, and the battery lasts a long time. I have used the phone pretty heavily through a 12 hour shift and still had 40% left at the end of the day.Don't let the one star review fool you, any apps you do not want can simply be disabled and the magazine app that is brought up by double tapping the home button can simply be disabled by checking a few boxes (no registration necessary), going into the app settings and unchecking the option for the home button.  Leaving a one star review for something so simple to change to your liking is absurd.This phone is also slim and light, back cover is a nice feeling faux leather and the phone is built to last.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "My perfect phone", "Author": "Ashton P. Johnson \"Zepaw\"", "ReviewID": "RG6QTAMCI9PPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a fan of the bigger sized phones for some time and Samsung has been paving the way in terms of quality large phones. I remember when I had the 4.5in screened Samsung Infuse and it was considered large. I've had a Note and Note 2 and loved both. Note 3 continues the tradition of keeping everything that worked, improving where needed, and adding features I wouldn't have even thought to ask. So many of the little annoyances I had with my Note 2 have been addressed.  Its clear they put a lot of thought into finding out what people loved and wanted changed.When I first held the phone I fell in love. The form factor is just great and the screen is a noticeable jump up. That's saying something when the Note 2 already had a stellar screen resolution. I don't feel the need to have this one in a case. The slippery back of the Note 2 required a case as I dropped it a couple times when holding it bare.Rather than go on feature by feature I'll suffice to say everything feels like a great and noticeable improvement. S-pen, camera, battery life, screen, on and on its the phone I loved before but better in every way I could have asked for. I've tried dozens of smartphones over the past 5 years. The Note 2 was the first one I actually held onto for a year. I easily see myself holding onto the 3 that much or longer (depending on when they bring out a 4th ;) ).I highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it but.... **EDITED**", "Author": "Irishlady", "ReviewID": "R228M5AKUX7HUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a fantastic phone--fast, beautiful screen, fun to use S-pen, etc. so I'm giving it 5 stars because IMO it is the best phone out there right now. But I have small hands and my hand does get a little achy from holding the phone for a longish length of time. I knew going in that this is a big phone and that's what I wanted because it's tough to read web pages and emails and watch TV (via Slingbox) on small screens. The back of the phone has a faux-leather cover that makes the phone a little bit less slippery. The back cover is VERY thin, too--which helps make the phone alot thinner than you'd think it would be given its size. (I just compared it to a friend's iphone, and this phone is actually thinner!) Some people have rated this phone lower simply because they don't like the plastic back cover. To me, I couldn't care less what the back cover is made out of since I will be using a protective case anyway! I love to draw, and the S-pen makes it fun to doodle and even write with. Although the phone has a setting where you can make the screen more sensitive so you can use the touchscreen even with gloves on, I will use the S-pen instead because it's more precise.There are so many features on this phone that I still haven't figured most of them out yet--after all, I just got the phone yesterday. Those who have a Galaxy S4 will already be familiar with a lot of the features of the Note 3.It comes with the usual Verizon bloatware, but you can remove the icons from your screens (but not remove the programs from the phone itself). You can disable them too. This phone packs 32gb of storage plus you can add an SD card if you have lots of music, pictures and videos that you want to store on your phone. So no worries for me regarding the space that the bloatware takes up. My last phone had 8gb of storage and I never used that up, even with the bloatware. If you are new to later Android versions, you may be surprised to learn that you can no longer store programs/apps on the SD card, which can be worrisome if you have less than say, 16gb of internal storage and you like to have tons of apps on your phone.**EDIT*** This phone comes with Android 4.3. I've just discovered that it does, in fact, allow you to save some apps on the SD card! Even so, this phone has so much memory, I will be hard pressed to use most of it.So far, all my favorite apps work great on this phone, except for HBOgo and MAXgo.*2nd EDIT* HBOGO has been fixed and it now works! Still waiting for Max go to be fixed. For now, I'm happy that my Slingbox works with this phone.Because of its size, this phone is not for everyone. But if you don't want to lug around a tablet but still want a screen you can see easily and use as a phone too, then this is your best bet.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Never thought I would switch from iPhone - until Now", "Author": "Michael D. Newcomer \"Photography Junkie\"", "ReviewID": "R45EGTZ1A34SN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even though I was heavily invested in the 'Apple Ecosystem' (iPad, iMac, iPhone, iPod, all that stuff), I just wanted a big screen!  I had the iPhone 4S before, and waited patiently for Apple to come up with a bigger screen, and the iPhone 5 was a huge letdown.  Yes, longer, but not wider.  Texting on that tiny screen, even in landscape was slow, and I never liked the autocorrect on the iPhone.  Just mad they wouldn't listen to their customers.Then I was at the Verizon store and saw the Note 3.  The display is beautiful and crisp, and I love how you can customize this phone to your heart's delight.  First thing I did was purchase Swiftkey and can almost text as fast as I type on a computer (100 wpm).A lot of the same apps that I had to pay for from the iTunes store are free on Google Play, and that was nice too.  The Note 3 blows away the iphone on processing speed, so I can finally play graphic heavy games like Dead Trigger 2 without freezing or stuttering.  Web pages load instantly, and with a screen this large, watching Youtube videos no longer has me switching to my iPad.  My iPhone  4s was only 3G and going to 4G LTE was a real treat!  Blazing fast!The iPhone had to be charged every day, without fail.  I can easily get 2 full days of battery life out of the Note 3 with light usage, well over a day with heavy usage.Call quality is crisp and loud enough for me, although I see others who say it isn't. The stock ringtones that came with it were not loud enough, but Google Play has lots of free ones that are pretty good.The stylus is a really nice option, and I can tell Samsung really put time into designing it, but for my purposes it's just faster to do it by keyboard.  Artistic folks will love it.Another thing that's nice that Apple doesn't allow, is access to the battery.  I picked up the Samsung spare battery charging system so now I never have to plug my phone in to charge; just switch out batteries.  The only drawback is it makes using a defender case a pain, so I just have a screen protector and nothing else.  It's also nice to have a backup in case of power outages, etc.Holding the phone takes practice.  It's much thinner and lighter than the iPhone 4s and a lot wider.  I find myself touching the screen and selecting things by accident when picking it up.  It looked so huge in the Verizon store, but after having it a few days, it looks like a normal phone, and everyone else's looks tiny.I know a lot of my fellow tech heads bash Touchwiz, but I have only ever used Apple, so I don't know what stock Android actually looks like.  To me, it's pretty fluid.  I like lots of blips and beeps, so it works for me.  Not once has this phone stuttered or lagged.  Seems like Verizon is slow getting Kit Kat out to us, but have heard others say that is pretty typical.I would recommend this phone to anyone.  If you spend all day and night with your phone, you will not be disappointed by the Note 3 at all.

Search Samsung's site for an app called Samsung Smart Switch. If for some reason that app fails you, move all of your text messages from your old phone to this one by loading a free app called SMS Backup & Restore and following the directions I outlined in my November 30, 2013 review of that product. Another free app you may want to consider is Software Data Cable, which allows you to back up your old Android phone to a laptop or PC, then move it to your new phone from that backup. You will need to load that app on your old phone and the Note 3, but it's simple and very handy.I'll attempt to not parrot the excellent and informative reviews that have already been posted. I do want to share my experiences with this phone and the ease of moving from the Note 2 to this model.The first thing I noticed is despite the small differences in size, the screen on this one if brighter, has more vivid colors and can be easily viewed in direct sunlight. That alone made my upgrade worth it.A second thing is this is a faster phone. I do not use it to anywhere near its capacity, but it zips along from one screen or app to the next with no lag. I was more than pleased with my older Note 2, but this one is even better.Having 32GB of internal storage is a treat, especially since I have a 64GB external SD card to augment it. That comes to 16GB more storage than my 80GB laptop, so it's easy to forecast that the next version of this phone could finally wean me off computers. As it is I am spending a lot more time on my phone doing stuff I use to do on my computer.I appreciate the greatly improved camera resolution and the easier and more intuitive interface, but that is icing on the cake. What I truly love is even though this one runs under Android 4.3 versus 4.1.2 on my Note 2, there are no major differences in the user interface. In that respect there was zero learning curve. After tweaking a few settings that did not come over when I restored my old ones, I was up and running as before in practically no time.While this ships with a cable that supports USB 3.0 and has what looks like a connector that is incompatible with existing micro USB chargers, that is not the case. You can still use existing chargers, battery packs and the such because their micro USB connectors will plug into one side of the charging port. If you have a computer capable of USB 3.0 your transfer rates will be lightning fast.With respect to battery, the Note 3 is about par with the Note 2 for use time between charges. Since the Note 3's 4.3 Android operating system does include Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support you may notice a slightly improved use time if you use bluetooth a lot. As it stands there is a very slight difference between the Note 2's 3100mAh battery capacity and the 3200mAh one in this phone.I am still exploring the nuances of my new phone, so as I discover noteworthy features that I have missed or emergent problems that I should warn about I will update this review to reflect them. In the meantime, if you are considering an upgrade to the Note 3 from the previous model and are wondering if it's worth it - I say yes. Read the other reviews for other perspectives and information too because combined there is a high level of customer satisfaction.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best thing ever!", "Author": "Alexia A.

I hope bug/performance fixes get released in a timely manner unlike with my Verizon GNexus.Might need to be patient and give the phone a few days\u2014I got a replacement and for the 1st 3 or 4 charges the battery would drain easily to 50% after 9 hours of usage and I was not even using the same amount of features as with the 1st phone nor even using it as much, but it improved over time.  The 1st phone did not have this issue and right out of the box would have only dropped to 80% after the same usage and only dropped 2% or 3% overnight instead of 4% to 6% like with the current one.Positives:Battery LifeCharge TimesScreen SizeSound Quality of both speakers -- so nice not to hear chipmunks anymoreSignal Quality (wifi and LTE)Camera Quality in decent lightingPhone stays cool during heavy usage (gaming, phone calls, etc)Overall Keyboard LayoutNegatives:Intermittent unexplained battery drainage\u2014Maybe NSA is spying on me? :)Auto-corrections on native keyboardThe way that the Phone and Contacts features work\u2014should be simpler to use with a screen this size but requires 2 hands or might be more suited to left-handed people with large handsIntermittent TouchWiz feature malfunctions (s voice, gestures, 1 handed mode, etc)Inability to remember audio settings for head set and constant prompts about volume safety--I only use audio jack while in the car connected to a cassette adapter (not earphones) since I don't have Bluetooth or any native support for smart phones in my car.Some Notes:TouchWiz adds much needed functionality to native android that is nice, but I\u2019ve turned off a lot of the features because some were overkill for my needs and too unreliable for every-day use.  I only have prior experience with Native android and Cyanogenmod and although I prefer TouchWiz over Native android, it still needs some serious work.  For instance, I find that the swipe to the left or right to message or call a contact works intermittently along with some of the other advertised features such as Smart Stay, S Voice, Hand Gestures, etc, so I\u2019ve turned most of them off and only enable some while using hands free mode while driving or at home.  It is also more difficult to do some of the most basic of tasks using TouchWizBattery Life and charge times with stock charger is very nice although at times since I got my replacement Note 3 it seems like something drains the battery much faster than with the 1st one\u2014going to eventually reset phone to see if it is some kind of OS malfunction.  With normal drainage I can usually go for 2 or 3 days on a single charge with what I consider moderate usage (Hangouts chatting, phone calls, iHeartRadio, gaming, and watching videos).  Considering that I have a larger screen than I had before, use more of the phone\u2019s features and for longer periods of time while running TouchWiz; I\u2019m impressed.  The battery is not even 2x the capacity of my GNexus which would have required 2 charges daily with the same kind of usage on Native android or Cyanogenmod.The screen is fantastic and I\u2019ve enjoyed watching both 1080p and 720p videos without problems\u2014native player can handle most video formats, but does NOT have the same support for audio encoding.Phone feels light weight and although it is aesthetically pleasing to look at, the materials feel kind of cheap so I\u2019ve invested in a cheap case to prolong the aesthetics.Things that I don\u2019t like:I currently know 2 other people who\u2019ve bought this phone and 1 of them along with myself had to get replacements.  My 1st one had issues with USB3.0 connectivity, a faulty charging cable, strange tapping sound during phone calls, and a few other bugs.  The other party had issues with the charging port\u2014not sure if the 3rd person had issues.  My friend that always buys Samsung phones says that the issues with charging ports are common, but this is only my 2nd Samsung phone so I cannot say for sure if this is the case.Auto-correct and word suggestions on native keyboard are a pain to use and so unnatural.  I\u2019m used to pressing the back key to have my words reset to what I initially typed in the event that auto-correct is not needed, but with this keyboard you are sometimes presented with a undo button and sometimes you just have to get creative and use the Sym button or write with the stylus pen to bypass the auto-corrections\u2014this is a major flaw in my opinion and should have been fixed by now considering that several updates have been released for the apps and the phone itself.  Should not take so much effort to type on a touch screen phone.  Hopefully Apple hasn't patented this feature.As with my Galaxy Nexus, the auto screen brightness is too dim for standard use.  Not sure how well it would prolong battery life for those who walk around a-lot while using their phones.Stylus is hard to remove\u2014good that it won\u2019t fall out on accident though. Surprisingly, it has not damaged any of my nails.  Interestingly, my protection case makes removing the stylus very easy--You go Cimo S-Line CaseIn order to use USB 3.0, it has to switch to airplane mode--transfers don\u2019t last very long at these speeds anyway and it has a built in feature to turn back on USB 2.0 mode if 5 minutes go by and USB 3.0 is not being used.  This feature can also be problematic if you try to let Windows Convert a video file to be transferred to the phone which would take more than 5 minutes.Wall charger has USB port on the side of the wall unit which too me is an invite for bent prongs considering that it is recommended that you remove it to save power and it wastes a port on a lot of Surge suppressors.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone, ridiculously great screen - but has keyboard annoyances that Motorola does not.", "Author": "TL Hord \"tlhord\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y4X8EKLQC2CA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is pure awesome. End of story. Lightning fast, full 1080p screen (which is mind-blowingly clear) - this phone has a lot going for it.However, Motorola has Samsung crushed when it comes to user-friendliness regarding typing. Let's face it - everyone gets annoyed now and again with auto-correct. But at least Motorola's auto-correct is intuitive, and understands when it changes \"Staind\" to \"Stained\" - and you go back to change it back to \"Staind\" because it's actually what you meant....  Motorola understands \"OK, you really meant to spell it that way...  we'll let it go.\"  Samsung corrects you again.  And even better, on a Motorola Droid - when you hit \"backspace\" after an auto-correct, it changes \"Stained\" back to \"Staind\" because it realizes you actually meant it that way. And, again on a Motorola, when you hit \"Sym\" to get your comma, then you hit comma, when you hit the spacebar to go to the next word - the keyboard changes back from symbols to letters for you. On Samsung, you have to hit \"Sym\" again to return to the qwerty keyboard.Minor things...  I know....  but it's very surprising Samsung gets these things wrong. I'd think by now, they would've had time to realize these inconveniences in their keyboard programming, and fix them for us.  Maybe someday....Regardless....  the phone is a true power-house of performance.

And I constantly read tech news and keep up to speed on advancements in mobile computing.  Only having my Note 2 for a year, I was in the market for a new phone because I decided to switch to Verizon.  I was torn between the Note 3 and the HTC One Max.  Most would say these are not fair comparisons because they are not in the same tier.  But for me, the One Max was very enticing.  I loved the idea of the front facing speakers, slightly larger screen, and better build.  But what sold me was:  replaceable battery, better GPU in the Snapdragon 800, and amazing AMOLED screen.  I'm partial to the screen due to the deep blacks and infinite contrast.  What has surprised me about the phone is the new quick charge 2.0 feature in the SD800.

I've had it for several months now.I can't think of anything I particularly dislike about the phone.I love:- the s-window so I can have YouTube playing while I surf other pages- the multi-window function, especially when researching stuff- the battery life. I have never had this phone die on me. I am on the phone often, both on calls, messages and apps and have never had a problem. It will warn me and I still have a long time before I need to plug it in- the screen size. It makes reading things (especially as I'm long-sighted) far easier. I find iPhones and my old Incredible2 comically small now- the s-pen. I love screen shots- action memo. Love that it works from the lock screen by using the s-pen. Love the loop function where you can google, or email, or add to contacts or map etc anything you type- WatchTV app utilising the NFC (near field communication) so I can use my phone as a remote for my TV- wave commands so I don't need to touch the phone (i.e. when cooking so dirty hands) to check the phone- that it's water resistant (it fell in the snow/slush over winter and was undamaged)- that you can resize the screen to use it one handed if neededI have no problems with the size. Fits in my normal sized pockets without problem. Sound quality is fine as well.I honestly cannot more highly recommend this phone. The only thing would be that if you have small, dainty hands this is not the phone for you.

Excellent battery.  I haven't found aftermarket apps, but in my transition i've noticed:What I do love:Great screen size to read everything comfortably, watch video clips, and appreciate pictures.Great battery life.  I had to charge the iPhone I had twice a day.  This I abuse and it still gets me through the day.  It also has a removable battery for instant juice.  Family I have in the Philippines have had to charge theirs 3-4 times a day due to the network infrastructure.ResponsiveIn my transition, things I have noticed:-Native list syncing is not present.  I decided to go with Wunderlist.  I would have used Google Task, but it's not developed yet.-No button that pulls up voice command like Siri does in the lock screen.  The voice command is not universal and not as easily accessible like Siri was.  You can have it activate in the lock screen with a double tap of the home button, but it doesn't work if the phone is unlocked.  If it is unlocked, you have to find the app.  There is a buttonless voice activation (\"Hi Galaxy\"), but it stops working sometimes.-Google maps will persist in lock mode, but only if you don't hit the home button to summon the unlock screen.  When you do that, the map disappears and you must unlock the phone to see it again (the iPhone will always show the map when navigating while locked, which was really nice).-Some apps tend to freeze.  I simply hold down the home button and swipe to close a running program and then reopen it.-The text size kept changing on me every time I tried to text.  I found you change the default text size with the volume buttons.-I had to be creative to migrate my contacts.  I moved everything to Google from my iPhone, then synced with my phone.  One thing that is great is that I can manage my contacts now through Google Contacts through my Gmail (they have a tool to remove duplicate contacts!-Text to speech engine is awesome, better than Siri in accuracy and speed, I think.-Camera and playlist controls aren't available in the lock screen as they were with the iPhone, UNLESS you disable security.I've used the pen when in phone calls to jot down and auto-call the numbers I write afterwards, which is really nice.  After the novelty of the pen, I reverted to using the on-screen keyboard.  I still use it on occasion.  I like the availability, especially when sending information to people or writing on maps.  I have used the S-Note notebooks to draw guitar chords and strumming patterns, so that's really nice.  I just wish there was more integration, so I can see my notebooks on my computer.For a case, I used the Otterbox Commuter, which works well.  It has no belt clip, but I would imagine I'd get tired of putting on the clip after a while anyway.  This just slides into my pocket.Did I enjoy my iPhone? yes.  simple, works, well integrated, robust, although sometimes non-responsive and poor battery life.Do I enjoy the Galaxy Note? yes.  Totally different experience with the larger screen, great battery life, more enjoyment of pictures, video.  It's not as well integrated, but it works and does what I want.  In a mobile computing device/phone that I have on me all the time the screen, snappiness, battery life, and pen bring really make it and are much more important in the experience.Will I stay?  I think so.  I will learn the phone soon enough.  The experience is just different.If you have any comments, please do!  I'm still learning the phone.  It is a great piece of art and master craftsmanship from Samsung.  It comes from South Korea, a powerhouse of cutting edge technology and force in the global economy (I was there for a year and can appreciate the history).

Check my video review for review of phone, some apps and GPS capability at the end. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone.  It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 2 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them. Phones don't get obsoleted. The previous gen phones still make phone calls and take great pictures as they did on day 1. Both Galaxy Note 2 and 3 have Micro-SIM. I have played around with a Note 3 and using on a regular basis and it is gorgeous phone in itself. The following paragraph applies to buying unlocked phones..DISPLAY: Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen.Note 3 has 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm (5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in) and weight 168 g (5.93 oz).Note 2 has Dimensions 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4 mm (5.95 x 3.17 x 0.37 in) and Weight: 183 g (6.46 oz).Note that it has become slightly less taller and 15 gm lighter! This is great as weight is a very important factor in handholding and for long uses. Both the phones have excellent S Pen stylus.Note 3 has 1920 x 1080 pixels, 5.7 inches (~386 ppi pixel density).Note 2 is 1280x720 pixels, 5.5 inches (~267 ppi pixel density). Note the superb increase in resolution. This is great as Note 3 has full HD finally. For comparison, Galaxy S4 has 5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display (441 ppi).MEMORY Both Note 3 and Note 2 has Card slot : microSD, up to 64 GB. Internal: 16/32/64 GB storage, Note 3 has 3 GB RAM whereas Note 2 has 2 GB RAM.WLAN: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band, DLNA (Both Note 2 and Note 3)Bluetooth: v4.0 with A2DP, LE, EDR (Both Note 2 and Note 3)NFC: Yes (both Note 2 and 3)USB: microUSB v3.0 (MHL 2), USB Host (Note 3, finally USB 3 on phones!)microUSB v2.0 (MHL), USB Host (Note 2)CAMERA:Note3: 13 MP, 4128 x 3096 pixels,autofocus, LED flash, Video 2160p@30fps, 1080p@60fps (Note 3, Note the substantially improved camera resolution)Note 2: Front: 8 MP, 3264x2448 pixels, video: 1080p@30fps, check quality; Back: 1.9 MPI feel for low light the camera did not perform well and this is an improvement I would like Samsung to make in low light sensors.Chipset:Note 3: Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400 (LTE model)/ Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 (3G model) Note 3 has Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 and if you see they have several technologies for different models.Note 2: Exynos 4412 Quad CPU: Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9 GPU: Mali-400MPSensors: Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometerGPS: with A-GPS support and GLONASSBATTERY: Li-Ion 3100 mAh battery (note 2) 3200 mAh (note 3)SAR (radiation level is often not considered in many reviews and it is an important level of comparison).SAR:Note 3 US Model: 0.55 W/kg (head) 1.49 W/kg (body)Note 3: EU Model: 0.21 W/kg (head)Note 2 US Model: 0.23 W/kg (head) 0.95 W/kg (body)Note that SAR ratings have increased for Note III version.Galaxy Note III is an awesome phone for its use cases. It is a delight for note taking purposes. I have used Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, Galaxy Tab 2/3 and I really love the Galaxy series. I can see the high end smartphones really getting saturated. For users with Note II or S4, I will not recommend upgrading unless you always want the latest and the greatest. You still have a great phone and it is not outdated just because Note III has come out. Your camera takes just great pictures as it did last month. Just like Detroit/Japan rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades. If you have a different phone or a low end phone or you are from that iSomething world, welcome to Galaxy series!Battery life is good.  The video playback was crisp. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs. I am not that annoyed with the Samsungware as I really like S-Health and some other apps. Mainly note taking apps are awesone.  People of course can root and put Cyanogenmod at some point later.I used to put a 64 GB microSDXC card SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging for video/song/ebooks.  I have since upgraded to 128 GB MicroSD and it works great! No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are: AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.Note III infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. Games were very buttery. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Smooth and Stunning display! NFC works awesome. I use a Qi charger with a Qi wireless receiver and they work great as well.Some Extra Accessories:NFC has lot of use cases. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAldiko Premium and Kindle Reading AppsAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoiceTemple Run series of gamesPlenty of WidgetsAPPENDIX: If you are comparing multiple phones, here is the quick highlevel breakdown of top phones as of mid 2014.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance.  External storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don't advertise or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version): 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.Ask questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy Note III.

I find this phone serves the purpose of both.  I love how everything is in one. I was always in love with the Android operating system, so I never really had much of a problem.  I found I got really frustrated with Apple products a lot, and switching to the iPhone was the biggest regret I had made.  I just don't like how everything is set up for you and you can't really customize anything.  Secondly, I love how the Note syncs with my Google account, from my Gmail to my calendar and my contacts.  I am currently taking online classes, and I am able to log on to my school website without a problem.

In many ways this phone really bridges the gap for her between a phone and a tablet.

I always hand write my text messages as I've never liked using a keyboard. I also love that I can jot down notes with my stylus pen, I use this feature a LOT for my work.  The speakers sound GREAT - when listening to music, the mix of tones is crisp and clean while blending beautifully!  I use my phone ALL of the time, and the battery life is AMAZING and especially compared to all of my previous phones!  I can't say enough GOOD about this phone.

The S3 is not a sloth by all means.High-Definition screen - what a different again. As clear as an iPhone or better.Screen Size - I can compare it to my stand alone GPS when I hook it on my windshield. Like LCD TV, bigger screen is better.Camera 13MP - much more clearer in interior settings and almost no lag time - quick, that's the quad-core at workVideo -  So much clearer, faster, and nicer than the GS3Battery Life - much longer - I have to charge the S3 daily.Wi Fi Signal strength - way better than the S3.Work as a PDA - That's what I use it mostly for and the pre-installed bundled apps from Amazon, Google, tools, and Samsung on a folder. The rest can be had through apps download.Sound -  Phone and music are much clearer than the S3. It has better bass sound.The Note -  Pad, Notebook, Scrap book, to name a few is amazing. What else it can do are to many to describe but they're great.OS Android version 4.3 Jelly Bean - is much improved.Plastic back case - Nice design. I have no problem because I have it on a hard case.More short cut icon to choose from. I can't believed I have it. . . . . .What I am not fond about:The Screen Page is limited to seven and it does not go all the way around. However, I decided this time to use folders and bunch similar together.Google Navigation -  It's not provided, don't know why?  Those available on Google play store does not let the use of contacts for destination.  This is the one I'm missing.That's my personal opinion.

The picture is great, reading is excellent, and the stylus is a bonus.  I use it sometimes, but not as often as I thought I would.  i do draw with it sometimes and also make notes.  Helpful, but not completely necessary.  I like that it stores right in the phone though.The camera is better on the iPhone 5.  Heck, the camera was better on my iPhone 4.  There is no macro at all.  So, you have to be pretty far away to focus - there is no low light.  I mean, none.  You have to use the flash which is only so-so or you have to just not take the picture.  Same situation, my husband will take the picture with his iPhone 5 & it will come out.  So, if a camera is your main focus, choose an iPhone.The audio quality is also not great.  When played on speaker - music, or speaker phone, audio book - it is fine, but when talking on the phone, the quality is less than stellar.  It is hard to hear (volume could go higher) because it does not come through as clearly as it had on my old iPhone 4 or on my husband's iPhone 5.  Same network, same people I'm talking to, so I've tested and it is actually this phone.ALSO - it does not fit in a normal sized pocket and falls out, so consider this when purchasing.  If you carry a bag all the time, that's great, but if not, do you have pants or a jacket with very large pockets?  If no, you will have to carry it all the time.  Also, in an evening bag, it is hard to fit.  I was at a wedding last weekend and carried it separately.OVERALL - I love to read on my phone and it is amazing for that.  I text almost all the time - also amazing for that.  AND, when you do get good pictures, the viewing and editing on this phone is great.  You can also draw over your pictures with your stylus which is fun and silly and amazing!  So, I do love this phone, but wish the camera was better.

It wouldn't charge in my apartment, which was strange.  I tried every outlet.  When I took into Verizon, they plugged it up and it worked just fine.  So, I thought it was just a fluke, so I took it back.  Now I just moved into a house and plugged it up there and guess what?  That's right, it didn't charge again!  Now I plugged it up by USB to my computer and it started to charge, so I left it there overnight.  By morning, it only charged to 85%, which is horrible.Then there is the voice command on this phone.  I asked to call someone in my list and it literally took 1-3 minutes for the phone call someone from list, which blew my mind since I just came off a Samsung Proclaim from Straighttalk and the voice command works flawlessly in seconds and connects me.  The Note was so sluggish and long!  Now this phone should be light years better than the Proclaim in this area, but no way.The size was bigger than I thought and was very difficult to put in any of my pockets.  Now if you have a purse, briefcase or bag, then it might be better.  It does have some weight to it as well, which wasn't bad.  It is very difficult or impossible to use with just one hand.Lastly the phone call quality was very good at first, but then got muddy and hard to understand over the 2 weeks that I had it.  Seriously the phone call quality was the exact same thing as Straight Talk!  You don't see many reviews that talks about phone call quality much, but the Note in the end was not good.  On the other hand, that could be Verizon.But pictures look stunning!  I took a few shots and was very impressed by the quality of the pictures and video.The pen function was different and unique, but not useful to me.All in all I sadly had to return it.  I really was looking forward to this phone for a very long time and it let me down.  Yes, it was probably defective, but as I searched about it more I found more and more people having similar issues if not now, eventually.I am considering something totally different and maybe more reliable like the Blackberry Z30.

I had to do this to read the SIM card number to Verizon Wireless, so they could activate it.I noticed that when I had device on maximum brightness (NOT on \"Automatic\") and was working on something over extended amount of time, the brightness would dim for a few seconds, then return to max. This would keep happening, at random intervals, and to seemingly random brightness levels. If I continued still to use it... say after 45 minutes or something, it would dim to MINIMUM brightness for few seconds.Now, it wouldn't show me or tell me in any way what brightness level it was changing to... I could just tell when it was putting to MINIMUM brightness. I got it replaced for another Note 3... The replacement had same issue... I called Verizon Wireless and then they revealed to me that this was a feature built into device by the manufacturer. I even spoke to Samsung to verify this.So, stay away from the Galaxy Note 3 at ALL COSTS! ANYONE that owned this device might need to operate the device on maximum brightness for extended amount of time...

I am new to Samsung, so I figured the UI would take a little getting used to. I was right; the interface is very different from Motorola or HTC. I think of myself as tech savvy, but the phone had little logic in the design of the menu's or locations for any of it's 80 important settings. The camera rocks at 13MP with crystal clear pictures, as long as you use the flash... The S-pen working on the \"back\" and \"list\" buttons was very nice but palming the pen to push the home button is tedious. The display is stunning and the \"adapt\" features on both the sound for headphones, and visuals are great. Speaking of sound, if you like listening to music or watching videos, I suggest you pick up a decent pair of headphones with your order. The speaker is terrible, its distorted and very sharp on c and s sounds. While loud, it lacks clarity in its volume. Additionally, the microphone is trash. I've had some one talk to me using my phone and the distortion is present here as well. If you talk on speaker a lot, as I do, this probably isn't for you. It, like every other phone I've purchased in the last 2 years, comes pre-installed with a ton of \"instant disable\" apps. (I would love to get the choice of what I want to store on my phone for a change.) It also functions poorly with the Youtube and Spotify apps I run. Aside from this, there is also the voice activation. It turned on at its choice of awkward moments, calling and texting without my knowledge. This, more than any other reason, lead me to the decision to send it back and choose a different phone. I'm going to miss the S-pen and Scrapbook but I think I can get over it. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 might be a great phone for some, but not for me. I wouldn't recommend it, but I won't say it was a bad phone.

IF I WANT TO DELETE PICTURES, SOME I CAN AND SOME I CANNOT. SOMETIME THE PICTURES MOVE AROUND TO DIFFERENT CATEGORY BY ITSELF WHEN I TRY TO SEE MY PICTURES.IF I TOUCH A SCREEN. IT MOVE LEFT OR RIGHT. IT STILL HAVE PROBLEMS AFTER I GOT ANOTHER NEW PHONE REPLACEMENT.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "\"My Magazine\" is baked in the HOME KEY. YOU CANNOT REMOVE IT", "Author": "D.

You integrate the most used key (center home button) on your phone and add \"My Magazine\" function to it. If you press the home key twice you are AUTOMATICALLY greeted to the \"My Magazine\"feature and then YOU MUST register and \"AGREE\" to the terms BEFORE you can \"disable it\". I BOUGHT YOUR PHONE FOR THE EXCELLENT HARDWARE NOT YOUR HALF BAKED SOFTWARE. BY FORCING ME TO \"agree\" the terms in order to \"disable\" it, you've achieved the exactly opposite. This is EXTREMELY INFURIATING and OFF-PUTTING. VIRTUALLY 90% OF REVIEW SITES MOCK YOUR BLOATWARE AND YOU INSIST THAT THE CONSUMERS WILL LIKE IT. YOU'RE NOT GOOGLE AND NEVER WILL BE. STICK WITH THE HARDWARE - SOMETHING YOU'RE SUPERB AT IT AND LEAVE THE BLOATWARE FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES. THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE RETURNED IMMEDIATELY DUE TO YOUR INABILITY TOLEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKE. THOSE WHO FAILED TO LEARN FROM HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO FAIL SO THEY SAY. STOP FORCING PEOPLE USING YOUR CRAPWARE SERIOUSLY. I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO USING MY NOTE 3 BUT THISGARBAGE \"MY MAGAZINE\" SINGLEHANDEDLY TURNED ME OFF TO THE POINT OF SWITCHING TO ANOTHER DEVICE.
