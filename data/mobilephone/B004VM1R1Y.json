The fact that it has its dedicated controller is a step up compared to most smart phones that just tries to imitate the iPhone.It's really good to play those old school games using an emulator on this phone... I was able to relieve my childhood again! Haha! I was playingold school contra, castlevania, megaman (rockman), life force, gradius, jackal, etc. Graphics is excellent, OS is fast and snappy, browsing websitesis a breeze as long as you have a fast connection. So many apps in the Android Marketplace that is free to download!If you like gaming like me... I highly recommend this phone and this seller \"Justbuydeals\" You won't be disappointed!This phone will instantly get rid of your boredom! lolP.S.I got this phone lower than what it is priced now here from this seller.

I have installed few emulators such as ffps from Playstation 1 and it was smoothly running most ps1 games.However, the biggest letdown is the phone memory and bloatware. The phone has a very small internal memory (Close to 380mb) and all apps must be installed in the internal memory first (You could move some apps to the micro SD card later). I run out of memory after one week (eventhough I moved all movable apps to the SD card, which is really a hastle to do so). The phone got really slow aswell.I tried to delete some of the unwanted apps listed below: (that I never used and some were always running on the background)1. Android Live Wallpapers2. Live Wallpapers Catalogue3. Chinese keyboard4. The Sims5. FIFA6. Star Battalion7. News and Weather8. Street View9. Office Suite10. Crash Bandicoot (as playing Playstation games using FPSEis batter)11. Media Server12. Event Thread Block13. Timescape legacy extension wrapper14. Twitter15. Anonymous usage stats (slow down the phone and useless)16. Distributed demo version17. Sony Ericsson sync18. Sync19. Sony Ericsson Sync master client20. Timescape21. Postcard22. Chinese social app (name is in Chinese)23. And even more.All the apps listed above are locked and cannot be removed or stopped unless the phone is rooted (hacked or jailbreaked in iphone terms) and doing this will void the warranty (as per sonyericssons website.I tried to root my device and accidently flashed the wrong image and now my phone is bricked. I hated android and sonyericsson. Yes the phone had some features but the overall experience is nothing compared to the iPhone.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004VM1R1Y"}}
