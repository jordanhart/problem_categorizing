Just set it on the magnetic Touchstone base, and you won't ever buy something that needs a cable again.5 minutes to learn 5 gestures and you have full command of the phone. Effortless one-handed use.

It's compact, looks unlike anything else on the market and it feels great in the hand. The small form factor is perfect for one hand use and the rubberized materials stick it to your skin without fear of slipping. On the construction side the phone is also pretty good; a satisfying strong slider mechanism makes it feel sturdy and purposeful, while the full QWERTY keyboard is perfect for everyday use. The WebOS operating system is also a treat to use and has some very unique features current smartphones are only adapting at the moment; most notable of which will be RIM's BB10 line of phones that copy the gesture feature that the Palm Pre 2 utilizes. The OS is strong and useful, however, its lack of support by a manufacturer means there are hardly any apps available. One the plus side though; being Linux based and open source, it is backed by a whole community of modders, developers and creative individuals who have come up with with some spectacular apps of their own.

I even put up with Palm QA problems to carry the T|X.  I own two Treo 680s and two Centros -- they are all in use.  The Pre always intrigued me, but the problems with build quality were troublesome.  I bought this Pre 2 based on reviews suggesting the build-quality issue had been addressed; I considered a Pre 3, but the cost was more than I was prepared to pay \"on spec\".  There are more things to like than otherwise, though I think the older PalmOS devices are more generally flexible and the QA on both the 680 and the Centro has proven excellent.  The Pre is what is in my pocket these days (though I miss some flexibility...).  Best of all, it is not an Apple; it lacks Apple's seriously flawed \u00e6sthetic.A comment on the vendor:  Noble Planet did a good job here.

I left webOS for other systems and I wish i never had. Coming back I settled on the cheaper pre2 vs. the pre 3. I cant be happier with this phone.The caseing has a thicker rubberized feel and just feels more solid. The keyboard is definately stronger and wont wear out. the keypresses feel like they should. The slider is also higher quality construction. The old pre- would rock side to side when opened and got slightly loose after a few months.Because the shell is a little thicker the holster i got with the pre- was a little snug but the phone still fit. it just didnt pop in/out as quickly. a slight modification to the holster and it was perfect. You may want to look into a different case/holster.The phone is faster than the pre- (double the speed @1Ghz) and has double the memory (512MB Ram) as well as double the flash memory at 16GB (more than plenty for me).battery life for my usage is superb. I average a few hours of calling and moderate txt per day. Wifi hasnt been shutoff once since i purchased the phone and after a 10 hour workday im still at 27% without recharging. My spouse has a new LG lucid with a 1700 mah battery and it has to be charged while at work to finish off the day.Altho webOS itself is dying for the current devices (check webosnation and look at open webOS) it doesnt mean what is already there doesnt have support. There are tutorials on how to \"Doctor\" the phone to the latest firmware (2.2.4) and heaps of homebrew developers with tons of apps and patches. This is my ONLY phone and it will be for a long time (until i get enough cash to get the pre 3 lol).I also recommend getting a touchstone the entire package on amazon is under $10 and i cant imagine not having it.

My speaker on my phone went out of whack, no problem I thought as I did a hard reset to start again.  Now the phone will never connect to any cell site and I have gone around and around with HP and their \"bullet-proof warranty\" and they refuse to warranty their product.  I am out the money and wondering how a wonderful company like Palm can die at such a bad hand of HP's doing.  I won't relate HP disaster on stealing my laptop and not responding to the police report.  STAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY far away from any HP product and you will live longer.One more lost American consumer in HP's hell.09-28-2012 Update, HP never changes after 7 years.....HP Never changes, the stole my Laptop about 7 years ago and just continue with this phone.  I finally got it approved to send in my phone after 3 months, and it got back from the HP repair center without my back battery cover.  I called HP and the said they are not responsible, so my phone still does not even work.  What Junk HP supports, stay far away from HP on everything, they have no ethical backbone.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Nicholus C.

The gesture-driven paradigm is brilliant.Integration of Cloud Services: Seamless. It supports multiple Exchanges profiles and integrates both my work Exchange accounts and my Gmail information nicely.Voip Connectivity: Doesn't support Skype calling and, apparently, there is no Skype applicaton. Moreover, there is no built-in sip stack so I cannot use my voip account on the phone.No turn-by-turn navigation (although there are Google maps).Camera is sh_t - no autofocus. Camera flash is atrocious.I have found the keyboard cramped and hard to use.The biggest disappointment, however, is the craftsmanship. After having the phone barely two weeks, I find that the hinge mechanism joining the device to the keyboard is loose and wiggles! What! Are you kidding. In addition, the cheap plastic with which they made this phone is an embarrassment.Bluetooth: Apparently part of the design, buy one cannot use bluetooth between this phone and another one. Hence, in order to transfer any contact or photos from my other phones, I have to configure some kind of cloud sync. This may be a philosophical point, but I want bluetooth connectivity.Battery is terrible. Used extremely modestly, I can sometimes not get even a day's use.SUMMARY: The software is interesting and fun; the other stuff lets the phone down.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great PDA, Terrible Phone", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R908P03658HCO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I love everything about this phone, except that.. well.. it's a crappy phone.  WiFi, Web browsing, all the other \"stuff\" is great.  Ease of use is wonderful, but at the end of the day it needs to work as a phone and this one gets great reception only if you camp out on a cell tower!  My old phone, a Motorola, worked fine both walking in my neighborhood and inside my house.  This one drops calls if a butterfly flaps it's wings in the next state.  My kids el'cheapo Nokia phone brings in 4 bars inside my house and works great.  My expensive Pre 2 might get 1 bar in the house and drops calls frequently.If the phone had good reception I'd give it 5 stars, but considering how important this one piece of functionality is I struggle to give it 2 stars despite how amazing the other aspects of the phone are.  The only other negative I can give it is that it sucks through battery faster than any phone I've ever had.  I'm lucky to make it through the day without needing to charge.  Granted it's doing a lot more than my old phone in terms of battery use, but the designers should have provided a larger battery.The Pre 3 is out soon.  I'd suggest anyone considering a Palm wait for it as hopefully this antenna problem is fixed and the specs on it are much better.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "i want my money back", "Author": "sherrie from baton rouge", "ReviewID": "RLXIC941MTAOU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I receive this phone from tequia and the phone wasn't wht I wanted.
