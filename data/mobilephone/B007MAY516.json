That and it didn't come with things the box said it did. However it was unlocked which saves one star for this review, since I was going to put it on T-Mobile. Speaking of which if you are planning to do that, please not that the 2g speeds are unbearable and I am not exaggerating. 1-3 minutes to load up a webpage on average. The speeds are so poor, I can't even use the Google Play store without the connection timing out. Luckily I have wifi at home. I can't complain too much though; the price was really good. Got it for emulating (which, by the way, is AMAZING) but sucks for anything else. Also, it used to run n64 games perfectly but now it has serious lag. I don't know what's up with that. It won't run games in the background due to lack of RAM. This is horrible because I'll be playing GTA and I get a text, I'll reply but then I have to start the game all over again. Speaking of games, DO NOT GET BIG GAMES. Big games take up lots of room on the 150 MEGABYTES of storage. Too people who aren't tech savy- the cheapest iPod touch has 8 gigabytes of internal storage that's about 55x more than this phone. Now some people say that you can just instert a microSD card. You can but not all games will move to the SD card and even if they do, some parts of the game have to stay on the phone. All-in-all I'm sad too say this phone does not live up to my expectations and I do regret buying this phone.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "VERY BAD EXPERIENCE", "Author": "ERNESTO OTERO", "ReviewID": "R3VDP4ACPZY6Q0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My shopping experience Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY R800 4G Android Phone (AT & T) Unlocked GSM has not been satisfactory, they offered me an unlocked phone and sent me a locked phone.
