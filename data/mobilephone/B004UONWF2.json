They are great.  I can afford a new fancy one but I like the size and durability of the defy. I haven't found anything that beats it for these features. The defy is well supported over at xda developers, google it.  It helps to be a little tech savy but it is more important to put the time in  to read and understand thoroughly how to upgrade the phone.  I have android jellybean on mine.  I wish there was something better out there for me but nothing beats the size, support and durability of this phone though I have never soaked it in the sink or Intentional dropped it. I've had chunks of plastic break off of the otter box skin/protector their not worth what they claim to be but the phone has survived climbing under cars in my pocket and general abuse. All Motorola defy MB525's have the same radios in them and there is nothing anymore international about this one that any other one that is unlocked for sale elsewhere.  I just talked to Motorola about it.  If you want a fancy big screen super fast latest and greatest phone this probably isn't for you.  I love it.  It's a legendary phone. Especially since I think it came out in 2010 and has a strong following. It helps if  you clear out the bloatware that Motorola adds and upgrade the software (this can void your warranty if you don't follow the directions but you can't permanently fry it from making a mistake upgrading it) .Update: After a lot of searching I found a picture of \"International\" kit and it seemed to include a European charging adapter. I think it might be helpful to explain the International component in the description. It took me a lot of searching to see if there was some sort of electronics in the phone that would make it work better abroad. Motorola no longer produces the original Defy so they had no information on the International part.  The new Defy plus is essentially the same as the original but they put a larger battery in it, overclocked the same old processor and updated the the android version. You can do the same thing with the original defy with a little work and even make it better.  Motorola isn't very good about updating their software I think they would rather just have you buy a new phone than be supportive.  But that's where the xda developers and similar sites really come together to make it a great and regularly updated phone.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Personal opinion.", "Author": "Oscar Vazquez", "ReviewID": "R3P8ZXNY3WF7YZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The reason is that I expected more speed and reception of internet web and the sourse works so slow, I think is because there are more modern cells and this product can not works like G4 but the phone calls are ok.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Jesler G.

With no *physical* button, taking pictures is tedious--taking self-pictures is almost impossible.- Power button is tiny and sometimes doesn't work. It has to be pressed in a specific way for it to work.- Motorola transfer software to PC is not user-friendly and crashes a lot.- Gallery - looking at picture folder thumbnails often freezes and doesn't unfreeze until you rotate the phone 90 degrees so the orientation updates. This happens regularly.- Adding app shortcuts to your home or other screen always takes 2 tries: the first time, it always stops responding.I'm rating this phone a 2 because as a working phone it works; as a smartphone, it's horrible.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bastante bueno", "Author": "Rafael Salas", "ReviewID": "R16K54XJTVF6CR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "El equipo se comporta muy bien, cumpliendo con sus caracteristicas sumergibles y anti polvo, arena. algunas veces se guinda por lo que hay que reiniciarlo, adicional a esto el telefonono llego sin auriculares. la bat dura solo 1 dia con uso normal.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "still a great phone", "Author": "rian", "ReviewID": "RBO88QF7VSKE1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I lost my last mb525 defy overboard so bought another. the later model so far has not had any of the minor problems that others have reported such as frozen screen requiring power off on to fix.
