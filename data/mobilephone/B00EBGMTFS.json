Thanks LG and also Tracfone for the triple minutes.PS - I would get a protective case for the phone, the approximate $8 cost likely saved the phone when I fell down the steps ( the phone was still working in case I needed to call an ambulance!  ).", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "I LOVE MY NEW TRACFONE!!!", "Author": "Erica Morgan", "ReviewID": "RXP21CN9KJIRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tracfone in March and I'm still loving it! I can get on Fb were it's got wifi and 3G and it texts great and I ported my att number to my tracfone and I have 956.53 mins left I just can't say enough about it. It is AWESOME!! Oh and the camera and speaker phone is great too. Thanks :) for an awesome product.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "FYI, before purchasing, this is not an Android Smartphone.", "Author": "Kvasir119", "ReviewID": "R1HN862NB55J1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let us get this out of the way first. This is a touch screen Feature Phone. Do not expect a Smart Phone experience. I have a rooted Nexus 4, running CM 10.1.3rc2, and I tweak it when I have time (so, yes, I use my Smart Phone for more than the average user would). This LG phone is nothing like my main phone and I did not have any expectation it would be. Only purchased it for work so I could have a totally separate mobile line from my personal and to make/take long calls while working and not destroying my main (have dropped my main a few times, and only while troubleshooting/working in the field; thankfully I have the main protected to the hilt (though my main's screen protector has already been damaged due to the drops... but I'd much rather have damage to the protector than the phone!). So, separate note, make sure to buy a screen protector for this phone. They're cheap (like $2, including shipping, just look around amazon). Would also suggest a case.Pros:Touch Screen! (kind of a con at the same time)Triple Minutes! (with a promo code shown on the Tracfone site you can get another 250 mins!)Call Quality (no complaints)Battery Life! (I am not a heavy user, so YMMV, but I'm on day 5 and it still shows 3 of 3 bars of battery life; on my android phone I'm lucky when I get a day and a half)Cons:Touch Screen! (the responsiveness is slow, but usable)Telemarketers??? (received a few calls within the first 24 hours; immediately registered the number on the do-not-call registry! Maybe someone had this number before me and was kind enough to spread the love of this number to others)All in all, I like it for what I purchased it for. Only wish it was android based so I could easily transfer my piles of contacts to it. I will probably look up how to do this via laptop to do the entries, instead of by tap tap tap times infinity using the on screen dialpad.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Great Deal from Amazon", "Author": "Larry W. Carnes", "ReviewID": "R25BBLDNMDYT75", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works great.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the mediocre manual and the difficulty transferring ALL my minutes from my old Tracfone to this one.The manual has almost no information on using the Wi-Fi and 3G Mobile features.  Since I had never used these on any cell phone, I could have used some guidance in the beginning.My old Tracfone flip phone had 60 days and 3500 minutes remaining.  When I called Tracfone for assistance in setting up my new LG 840G it took a while but when it came online a few hours later the 60 days from my old phone had been added to the year of service on the new phone.  However, the only minutes were the 1200 that I gotten with the purchase of the new one.I called Tracfone again and explained that they had neglected to transfer the 3500 minutes.  After nearly an hour of trying, the best they could do was transfer 2750 of the old phone's 3500 minutes.  They gave me a service ticket number and promised if I called next month they would transfer the rest of my minutes.  Apparently their software won't allow the transfer of more than 2750 minutes per month.Aside from that, I'm very happy with the phone.  It's not a good choice if you're a heavy Internet user but for checking your email or doing quick searches online it's fine.  And the reception seems much better in remote areas than my old Tracfone.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "kathryn s pione", "ReviewID": "R2UY81IQT9W62X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love using this phone!
