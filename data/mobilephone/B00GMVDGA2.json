People like them for different reasons. I like this phone. Most phone reviews tend to ignore these devices are primarily used for voice TELEPHONE calls. The Alcatel ONETOUCH Fierce is an excellent voice telephone call device. Really. Some more expense phones are crappy for simple phone calls. The telephone call volume is excellent. Contacts interface is gorgeous. Plays youtube videos like a true champion. If taking photos or videos is very important to you, forget this device (front facing camera and all). Truth be known, I like this phone better than higher priced \"Ga-ax-\" phones I have used, which have much better cameras. Screw it. I use a \"real\" camera for picture taking. I like the shape of the device and the way it fits in my pocket. (The portrayal of this device as \"5 inches\" in the picture should indicate the DISPLAY is 4.5.)", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!!!

I'm now waiting to see if the phone lives a long and happy life. I'm tentatively giving it four stars based on what I believe are its best features:*Fast Processing--From my perspective, the phone processes data fast (quad core processor).*Big Screen--I've seen other phones of this type, and the screen on this phone is the largest I've seen.*Responsive Touch Function--It's rare that I've had to double tap on the screen.  It's quite responsive.*Easy to Navigate--In my opinion, the options are simple to access.  I had the phone configured within a short time.*Preloaded Software--There are a good number of programs preloaded on the phone.*Optional Mobile Data--You can shut down the mobile data and simply surf on WiFi.*Optional Addition of SD card--Add a memory card for additional memory.*Doesn't Seem to Drop Calls--I haven't made many calls with this phone, but those I have made were good.*Adjustable Volume--There's a button on the side that you can use to adjust the volume, and it works well.On the down side, I don't like the idea of a fixed battery.  Should the battery in the phone die, what are the alternatives?  Also, in my opinion, the images from the camera appear soft (out of focus). It might be okay in a pinch, but I will be taking my digital camera for those special events.This is my first Android phone, so I'm easy to impress.  Keep that in mind.  I don't know how this phone stacks up against others on the market.  And I'm not certain that this would have been my first choice had I bought a phone for myself (it was a gift.)  As it stands, I'm watching it to see how it functions in the long run.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Cool", "Author": "Abel perez", "ReviewID": "R2G4JFRBWU4DH1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When my mom arrived home with this phone I was really skeptical about it specially because my mom doesn't know a lot about phones, so she asked me to see how it is. My first reaction after looking at the screen turned on was surprising it is in HD. Then I noticed that it is powered by android and it has Google play as the app store which is great. It has many features like voice search, playing youtube videos in normal quality and high definition and flash and panoramic camera. Which leads to one not so important, or maybe important to some people, both of the cameras are pretty good but not excellent. After inspecting it I felt very jealous of my mom so I decided that I should get it too.I recommend it if if your notthat in to camera quality, its awesome and I like it a lot.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Alcatel's Horrible Phone!", "Author": "Paul \"wds\"", "ReviewID": "R3DELP1T0VRF3L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I usually do not push any product to one-star rating, unless they deserve really, yes I mean really.(1) Purchased 3 phones of this model 7024W. Out of three, one died within a month.  You cannot remove the battery and try with a new battery because this phone comes with a non-removable battery.  For this happened within the first 30 days of purchase, I could easily return the phone for refund.(2) The camera does not produce quality pictures that a 5MP camera supposed to. Plus, the camera lacks auto focus.(3) The touchscreen is horrible because when you touch a particular number on the dial pad, it pick up a number up or down to the touch location.  Couple of attempts required to get the right letter or right number on the screen.(4) Some phones in this model has battery problem. They do not give enough back up.  The battery indicator shows one bar within an hour of use.  Charging takes more time.For the aforesaid reasons, I rate this phone for one-star and highly discourage others from buying because you are taking a chance with this product.  I have nothing against this brand or model or OS but the performance is far below the standards. At the same time, I have used some of the Alcatel's basic phones. They appear to be ok.

I went through 3 of these phones before I gave up and looked elsewhere.  The first phone was glitchy with the kindle books app.  I thought the sd card mounted fine and then I turned it off overnight to find out that all apps loaded on the card were gone and the card unmounted itself.  Phone number 2, the card seemed to mount fine, but the screen would sometimes not come on after the phone was asleep. Then after about two weeks I lost the apps on the sd card.  That same day, it took about 10 minutes to get the phone to turn on. Phone number 3: the sd card would not mount.  I gave up and started looking elsewhere.  Overall, I would say this phone is junk if you want to use the sd card.  If you want to just use the 2Gb of usable internal memory the phone would probably work fine.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dead on arrival", "Author": "Pando", "ReviewID": "R37UFLORO2DDBM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Charged for 2 hours.

It is not at all counter-intuitive.  Features that I easily figured out in my previous phones have been so complicated I have had to look them up on the internet.  The user-manual is piss poor.  Even my husband who works at Google could not figure out features that *should* be simple, such as editing contacts, adding bookmarks, finding settings, etc.  It is maddening, maddening, maddening.  The camera is poor quality and gives a blue, pink, or yellow tone to the photos.
