Fresh charge in the morning and by the next morning it is beeping that it has a low battery and needs charging.The touch screen is rather sporadic in sensitivity. Sometimes it works fine and others it takes MULTIPLE taps to do anything. Very frustrating. The included \"apps\" on the menu are worthless and CAN NOT be deleted off the menu to make room for others. Very slow getting online but that is not the reason I got the phone but I did try it a few times and it was sluggish as heck. Virtually useless. Sound is OK on calls but the reception is rather low.....steady 2 - 3 bars out of 5 no matter where I go......many times reception drops completely while in non-use but I have yet to get a dropped call. Phone beeps when it loses signal and it has done that multiple times.The most annoying thing is many times the screen and side buttons become too sensative.....whether it is in my pocket or in my hands the screen will pop to something I never intended it to. Taking it out of my pocket it will already be on and on a random screen. In my hands many times just a brush of my finger or hand and multiple layers of screens will open.Wouldn't recommend this to anybody. Going to try and return it, too frustrating to use and keep.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "HATED IT AT FIRST, IT GREW ON ME, AND GREW", "Author": "Leif A. Ostgard \"ostgard\"", "ReviewID": "R3TY3XV0K6VJJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone with my new contract because it wasn't internet service plan requiring.  I at first was irritated by the touch screen always activating when I talked on the phone, but eventually I got used to how to hold the phone not smashed up against my face as the screen is very receptive.  The aps off the bat I loved, but still getting used to where and what things did was annoying, eventually I got the hang of it and started to really like the phone.  The apts, photo center, etc are very good on this phone with the panacamera being the best.  I used to have a karma, which I loved because it broke down text messages into conversations by name.  This doesn't do that which is the only flaw I can think of.  Battery life, speed and durability are very important to me and this exceeds expectations.  So far its the best phone I've ever had.  I would recommend this if you don't hang out on the internet all day and use your phone for texting and talking with occasional interent use.  If you are looking for a laptop phone its probably not the best.  This is good for someone like me that doesn't want a huge phone bill and doesn't use the internet on his phone unless he has too.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005M1OPUI"}}
