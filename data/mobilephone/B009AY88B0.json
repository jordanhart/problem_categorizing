It is a little under powered compared to the top of the line devices but it's also hundreds less. I have had a few strange things happen with random reboots, but this is my first unlocked phone so I'm not sure if that's a problem with the SIM I'm using for service or the phone but it hasn't caused any problems and has only happened once in the month that I have had it. Battery will usually last me between 24 and 36 hours but I'm not a heavy user by far. It came with a 2 GB micro SD card in the slot when it arrived it seemed a bit hard to get out but the trick is to slide it loose from the contacts then face the screen toward you and it will fall out.

It it certainly very durable and has yet to scratch though I keep it in my pocket with keys and coins and don't use a screen protector. However, my proximity sensor was broken from day 1 and this caused the phone to freak out when I'd actually try to use it as a phone. I ended up rooting it and flashing the Chinese version of ice cream sandwich, which did not fix the sensor but it stopped freezing in-call. Other than that, the phone is pretty fast for the price and runs ICS smoothly, once you root it and get rid of all the Motorola bloatware... :)", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "The phone was faulty, couldn't write, did not charge the battery", "Author": "Marcela", "ReviewID": "R2GD7CTXJVJG6M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone was useless, I couldn't write anything, the virtual keyboard dindn't pop up.

Waited this long to insure that I knew the quality of my purchase before I commented.  I don't use a cell phone much but this one is really different from previous models I've owned.  The battery life is exceptional and the sound quality is the best I've heard.  I'm a bit hard-of-hearing so I use the speaker phone mode most of the time.  It works great.  Additionally, I'm a cheap bugger so I have a pay-as-you-go program with AT&T.;  I'm actually thinking of spending the money so I can get some of the applications offered by the other contract type programs.Anyway, this is a quality phone and I think you'll enjoy one as much as I do.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "No thanks.", "Author": "Mr Peve", "ReviewID": "R2J3T5UFJD1TFK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not a good purchase.
