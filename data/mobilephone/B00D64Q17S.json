The main things that differentiate this Android phone: big screen, big battery, and dual SIM.  I almost bought the BLU Life Play (grew tired of waiting for the Life One and Life View), but ultimately decided on the Studio 5.3 S because of its larger 2800 mAh battery (vs. 1800 mAh for the Life Play).  With light-to-moderate use, this phone/battery will go the entire day without needing to recharge.  I wish this model had the 720x1280 screen and higher HSDPA speed of the BLU Life Play, but having increased battery life was more important to me.  The camera seems \"OK\" but will need to test it more.  One CRITICAL ITEM to note: my phone did not come with any APN (Access Point Name) settings for AT&T;, so I got frustrated trying to figure out how to get mobile data working.  Go to [...] (or Google \"BLU apn settings AT&T;\") to find this video, which was a lifesaver.  Dual SIM calling feature works well.  When you dial a number, press button #1 to call using that SIM and press button #2 to use the second SIM... pretty straightforward.  Overall, the BLU Studio 5.3 S is a very good phone and a great value.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not locked, no contract big phone", "Author": "Alex V", "ReviewID": "R3GP1LBQT9W4ES", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I do not like the Term, unlocked phone. That would indicate it was locked or can be locked. I would say non-carrier specific mobile device.When buying a phone not sold by providers I do not expect much for the price. When I received it I was surprised to find a back case cover and a screen protector. The case only covers the power button; its hard to push, but if your out and about you cant go wrong. I may consider cutting the covered power button. The volume rocker is not covered, I want the power button to be the same.The only cheap part of the phone is the charger (besides the case.) I may want to use something that does not get as warm and cheap feeling. Most people talk about the features; it's Android 4.2.1 without the carrier customizations. It's all the same. Since it does not have all of the Samsung or HTC bloat-ware and features most people don't use, you don't need all of the power other carrier locked phones have.I was looking for a bigger phone that allows me to read email, text and use the browser once in a great while. I came from the HTC one, I did not use most of the features but I do miss the screen resolution. Given the size of the screen and battery, I am finding it harder to miss my last phone. For those who want LTE, why complain? LTE is really nice when using it with a laptop or desktop. But for a phone, I have no issue waiting the extra second for a mobile page to load. Be careful if you use a dummy phone data plan, AT&T; will add the smartphone app. I would turn off data and use it when you need it. Then connect to WIFI when available. If you live in a major city, WIFI is every place.The camera is 8 Mega Pixel. Like all camera phones they work best outside. I had both the iPhone 5 and HTC One. If you are used to the indoor quality, don't expect it on this phone. I have a point and shoot camera I will start to use after storage for 3 years. The cost, size and commitment free features make this phone worth it. If you break your contract phone, you will have to pay 100-600 bucks to replace or fix it. That cost can go towards the same phone, or newer model. I don't think I will get new subsidized phones if I have the option to pay the same price contract free.The best part for me is not having to carry 2 phones.  Personal SIM as SIM 2 (avoid paying for data) and my work SIM (using for data)Some people have issues with setting up APN settings. I had a few issues, but I did a few more Google searches to find the settings that worked for me.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone, great price", "Author": "Francisco Delgado", "ReviewID": "R1ND0B3AS3X6QF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone works very well.

So, please excuse me if none of my comments are \"constructive\".I have owned various makes:  iphone, kyocera, htc, lg, and more recently blu.  I purchased the BLU Studio 5.3S because it was being sold/produced by a company based in the USA, and presumably \"Made in...\" too.  Needless to say, I have not been at all impressed.  In fact, I've been underwhelmed!I had an issue with this particular model's board after only a month or so of use.  One day suddenly, it would not power on at all.  I immediately reached out to BLU's technical support, and the response time from them was lacking.  They had virtually no support queue, and when the line rang, it rang, and rang, and rang...  I ended up having to reach out to BLU's business development team just to get a more prompt response.When I finally did get an RMA to return my device to BLU for support, they kept it for over a month.  Ok, so maybe it was a subcontracted 3rd party, but really!?!?!?!There's more!The case enclosure is cheap.  The buttons glued on horribly, and thin flimsy pieces of rubber not attached to the main chassis, but rather to the case itself.  Zuh?!?!?  Right side power button fell off after some time.  I use a paper clip to lock and unlock my device.  Embarrassing and cumbersome!The innards are cheap.  The clasp that held the SD card fell off after a good three times opening and closing.  (Perhaps I'm expected to leave that alone?)As far as its GPS radio, the signal constantly fluctuates in and out.  I don't believe it's due to coverage.  On several occasions I have had to toggle my WiFi and the Carrier Network just to get one running.  Is there something wrong with the onboard radio receiver of this device?  Could be me, but really!?!?!?!And maybe this is petty, but the accessories for this model are non-existent!  Maybe that's why it's so darn cheap now, and has been pretty much erased from BLU's offerings.  The blunder they want to forget.  Clearly, this device was a failure.  Sadly, I feel duped as a first-time customer.  (I paid $220 for this paperweight.  And considering the cost of the no-contract prepaid phone I needed while my BLU was being repaired, that would up my total cost for this phone at over $320.  Should've gotten a Samsung!)Either way, the series of issues I have had with this have been very disappointing, discouraging, disenchanting...  so much that I am not keen on touching BLU products ever again.  I'll just stick with the standards.

I came across this phone by happs on amazon and was blown away on reviews on youtube as well. I had did some cross reference checking and seems that this is a great phone. Look I don't need everything on the Galaxy note not do i need 1,000 apps that come with it. So, I can save some money and still get android jelly bean and get that hot spot that I want. I just ordered this phone for my friend on my account he is anxious to get his and I'm anxious to see it as well. So, soon as I sell my note on amazon I will be getting this blu phone right here. I had a unlocked galaxy note and connected it with Solavie/T-mobile phone service it was no contract sim card company. Me and my friend will be using it with this blu as well. The service is great and customer service, it's $49 Unlimited Talk Text Data 4g Nationwide no contract and if you share with others you can earn $ just by sharring so that was a huge perk for me. Anyhow, If i was you and you need to connect your blu phones with a  t-mobile service still go check them out. [...] you can find out more information about it. We are waiting for amazon to ship this bad boy out!! hurry up amazon!! I only gave this 4 stars since we are still waiting for it but I know it will be 5 starz!Quick update! 8-26-13We received the phone this saturday was waiting for me to pick up. Since this was for a friend I was there when he opened it and started it up etc. What can I say... this phone is 5starz.. who needs samsung  note when you can have this bad boy.. jelly bean 4.1 stock camera was good recording was good no issues and love this phone. .we did put it with Solavei phone service like above and works great....one thing I would say is put the sim card in slot 1 from right to left when you open the back up... don't put it in slot 2 it limits the only to 2g... had to find that out lol.. but love it!! head over to [...] hook yours up with Solavie/T-mobile he loves it can't wait to order mine!! and it's Hot spot !!", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Drivers for documents transfer", "Author": "James Wu", "ReviewID": "R3UA1TA84Z57GE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The package was missing the driver related CD or software.
