Rogers", "ReviewID": "RQVBA2ZX3RNIS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My previous phone (A LG EnV3) was a terrible phone, so I was looking forward to getting a new phone. The only thing I do with my phone is text and make the occasional phone call so I didn't want a smart phone, however, I did want a phone with a QWRTY key board. I also did not want a touch screen; therefore this phone was perfect for me.  It was a nice cheap phone (free when I updated my contract) that fulfilled all of my wants. The phone also has a demo of UNO that you can play as many times as you want. The only thing that is annoying about the demo is that after every game you have to load the game back up all over again, but hey, free UNO games so nothing much to complain about. I haven't played with the internet features and e-mail features because I don't use that kind of stuff on my phone, so I cannot review that part for you. I love this phone; the only thing I don't like is the battery life. My old phone could last a week on a single charge with very little use. I could leave this on my bookcase fully charged for three days, not even touching it, and it'll die. Someone told me I had some kind of setting on in my phone somewhere that was killing it, but I have yet to find this feature. I forgot to mention that this phone has a SIM card in it and the headphone jack is not a standard size, it's the small one a 2.5mm I believe it is called so I have not used it to listen to music on, other than the speaker which works fine.Overall, this is nice little phone if you just want to text and make a few calls, but if you want something fancy then you should look somewhere else.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "It works", "Author": "B.

Ahrens \"YARRRR!!\"", "ReviewID": "R1ICRTKIUM41S1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this a little over a week now, and I'd say I like it.I upgraded from a Samsung Intensity, which gave me frequent \"butt dial\" problems, and a camara that failed consistently.The camara on this is good, and it has even better video (although I haven't transfered it yet). I haven't had any accidental dialing, and I like the way it fits in my pocket and hand.The dial buttons have given me some problems for one because they are so very small, and my chunky frozen fingers didn't deal well with them at first. I'm over it now, and the most recent annoyance is that the dial pad doesn't include normal phone related alpha-numerics so when i was forced to call 1-800-Progressive for a car issue this morning, I got very frustrated trying to figure that out. Obviously that's not something most people will need to deal with on a regular basis.It was easy to set up the way I wanted it and the battery seems as good or better than my last phone (which was good on batts, too).It just takes a little getting used to!", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT PHONE", "Author": "Joslin", "ReviewID": "R76XU2AZ8RV8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*Functionality*I had one of the original Pantech Jest phones that had the touch \"Ok\" button, and while I liked the functionality and overall design, that part drove me INSANE! I HATED it!With this version, having the actual buttons present is a relief. No more having to double tap or triple scroll to get the button to work.I am a college student who definitely does not want to pay for all the data plans and web fees so this phone, which can be purchased without a data plan, is great! The camera is good and has the basic features you would expect from a basic phone. Making calls is easy, texting is a breeze and using the built-in apps is seamless! The only thing you MUST do with this phone is customize the settings, but that is the fun part of a new phone.Some reviews complained about the background, which is something you can change. Another review complained about the backlight shutting off, which if you customize your backlight setting to stay on longer then it will. Want to see the text messages in a thread format? Just change the settings! This little phone has all kinds of settings that can be customized easily to make this phone work for you! I love it and wouldn't trade it for anything!*Durability*I dropped this phone about 4 stories from my college's football field bleachers through the crack in the seat straight to the ground. The ONLY thing that happened was the battery back came off and the screen had MINOR scratches, otherwise the phone kept working.I have spilled liquid on it, dropped it in the sink and in a puddle outside and it still works just fine!This phone has literally been through every possible test anyone could put on it and it still works very well. If and when I do upgrade to a \"Smart\" phone I will definitely keep this little phone as a backup!*Overall*This phone deserves 6 stars for being the best quality phone I have EVER had.

Wallace", "ReviewID": "R2JKNUJWZXRFZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone a few months ago after reading some scathing reviews. I was really worried that it would crap out on me. But this is the best phone I have had. I don't use the internet on it so that isn't an issue.So I can't really give a review on that, but I'm sure if I was using the internet I would hate it. But using it as a phone and a medium to text it works perfectly. I had heard that the keys were too small they are the perfect size for me and I think I have average sized fingers. I have had none of the problems that people have claimed to have had with it malfunctioning...knock on wood! The only negative is that it does feel a little flimsy. And I am very clumsy so I'm hoping with a case that will be remedied. Over all I love it its the perfect phone for me, a college student that has a tablet and doesn't need a smart phone with an expensive data plan.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great basic phone!", "Author": "John Scott", "ReviewID": "R1KXHOP11X6PSH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone does everything someoone with a need for a basic phone could expect from it.

After ~6 months it started freezing and after about 8 months it stopped working entirely. We went to the Verizon store and they said it was water damage; we should have gone in when the glitches started I suppose but the only 'water' the phone was near was being in my boyfriend's pocket during a storm right before it stopped working.

This one however, is a different story. I've had it about a year and a half now and I'm still not used to it.Texting is tedious and takes forever- you have to go the long way around when you want to switch between upper & lower case, numbers & punctuation.  I've gone through a lot of phones, and always been able to type messages quickly & easily - but using this thing, one would think I'd never used a cell phone in my life!And then there's that locking & unlocking issue- it unlocks too easily, but locks again too quickly so you can't hang up without unlocking it first, which is easy to forget (and needless to say, can lead to an embarrassing situation!).I gave it 2 stars because it's cute, well made & durable, and I like the cool green display.

I purchased it because it was mismarked on Amazon's website as having a 3.5mm jack (the last time i checked, it wasn't fixed despite having informed Verizon, Amazon and Pantech...) and kept it only because of the terrible and time consuming process of doing refunds. Anyway, besides using a useless 2.5mm jack in a day and age where everyone is using the standard, the phone glitches and refuses to accept proper commands at least twice a day and i am forced to reboot it. The \"unlock\" button is the biggest and most prominent button on the phone so i am constantly butt dialing/texting people and in general, it is slow and terrible. The design flaws on this make me 100% sure the engineers and coders were either intentionally making a terrible cheap phone to encourage people to upgrade or they are incompetent and have never actually used a phone and thus don't know how real people operate them.Hey Pantech, why bother making total junk?", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "rf", "ReviewID": "R1DXMM5C7GL8NT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it.

I receive texts and calls just fine and it is clear enough to be heard.  If there is any background noise the phone picks it up and amplifies it and blasts the other caller with it.  The menu GUI is ok, no better or worse than any other phone.  It charges quickly and transfers data from the computer quickly, but sending pic messages is a bit slow.  So it's a passible phone.  Unfortunately the complaints I have are starting to outweigh the good.2.5mm headphone jack makes it almost useless (I've got an adapter but it sticks out way far otherwise you have to find headphones online that you like for only 1 device because stores don't really carry that size)Even though it's not touchscreen it likes to browse menu or online and even have the lock guard on while a window is opening.Final straw is the end/power button has stopped working.

Instead, the phone came with a large bulbous OK button.  Any desirable features of this phone are completely overwhelmed with this terrible design.  A slight touch of the OK button unlocks the key pad and the phone navigates itself to all different menus (including inadvertent web browsing) while you're carrying it.  This is true both carrying it in a pocket or even when inside a leather carrying case.  I don't see how anyone could use this phone.  There is a security lock, but it requires you to enter the 4 digit passcode in order to do anything incluidng answer the phone.

I thought that downgrading from a smartphone to just a regular phone would save me money and it wouldn't be as complicated. Now when I say complicated, keep in mind I am not that tech savvy, so \"complicated\" is a relative term. I do know enough to know that something isn't right with this phone. The first problem I had with this phone was how easy it unlocks. It would unlock and be on a random menu or in my text messages, which wasn't really a problem as much as it was an annoyance. This isn't the first phone I've had this problem with, and I know I'm not the only one. The one thing it did start doing that was a problem was it would unlock and get online. I don't have a data package for this phone because I wanted to, as I said before, save money. This didn't help. It racked up several charges, and even after I called my provider to get this take care of, it still kept happening. I asked them to block access, which they assured they would do, and they also reimbursed me for the charges. About a week or so ago, I pulled my phone out of my purse and- surprise! -it was online. I quickly exited out of there and then, just to see, I tried to get online. It not only got on, but it stayed on for over a minute. Now while this is more of a provider issue, the phone unlocks so easily that it doesn't really matter. It costs me so much money I should've just stayed with the smartphone!Now, the big issues, the two that are the main reason I want to get rid of this phone, are as follows:1. The phone does not always receive calls or text messages. Sometimes I get a voicemail without seeing that I even received a call, let alone missed one. Sometimes my phone won't ring. Sometimes it shows I missed a call without ringing. Sometimes when I go to send a text it will say that it had sent it, but it hasn't. It won't even be in the conversation I was having with the person. Sometimes it says it sent it, and the message is in the conversation, but when I go to check it later, it isn't, and the person never received it.2. The keyboard is horrible. It often types extra letters. First it was just one key, and now they all do it in turn. If it happened just a few times, I would think it was me, but it happens at least twice a day. The other problem is that with some of the keys, you have to pound on them to get them to work. If you want upper case letters or punctuation, then you have to work for it.To sum it up- Do not buy this phone!

What we have found out in the first week of use is that the phone: 1. has a green background screen that cannot be seen in daylight, even when one covers the glass with one's hand.  2.  The text functionality is very poor.  You can type in a text and send it, but when someone responds, you cannot see the thread.  There are scroll bars on the right side of the text display, but no obvious way to get it to scroll up or down.  3.  We took a bunch of pictures with it this weekend, but when we plugged it into the laptop, we could not download the photos or videos.  Apparently one has to take the phone apart, put the SD card, and plug it in to an adaptor to get it into the laptop.  Not something we had to do with our last Motorola.  4.  It is difficult to make calls.  One must input the local area code every time, and it is hard to hang up the phone.  Apparently the screen locks during the call, and one must unlock the screen before hitting the red button will end the call.  For a phone that is touted as a good basic phone for phone calls and texting, this is not an easy phone to use.  If my smaller children had to dial 911, I'm not sure they could figure out how to do it.  We are returning these to Verizon to get some other phone that will function as a basic phone.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005PT610O"}}
