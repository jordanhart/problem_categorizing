(this is from a webOS and Android user)-Battery life is good.Neutral--There's a lot of AT&T; logos on this thing. One above the outside screen, one below the inside screen, one on the 'OK' button, and when the phone is open, the outside screen has the AT&T; logo on it.-There is some AT&T; bloatware on this, but it generally keeps out of your way.-Shortcut buttons under the inside screen. These will be useful to some, but it can give the feeling that there are too many buttons on the thing.-A control phone with voice button. Useful to some, but a dedicated button is overkill.Cons--The outside has a bit of cheapy plastic that creaks sometimes.-The camera is placed precisely where your fingers are going to be.Bottom line-This is a very nice phone if you just want it for the basics (calling, and the occasional SMS). It's probably one of the best phones on AT&T; if you just want to call people. I originally had a HTC Aria (Android). This beats it in call quality in and out. This is also quite good for technologically illiterate people. It's very easy to use.This one deserves five stars.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Good Basic Phone for Older Folks", "Author": "Old-Lumens \"O-L\"", "ReviewID": "RPHDA1XL29WI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been a great phone for me & my wife. We don't need a fancy phone. We just use a phone for \"what it is intended to do\". To make Phone Calls! Anyone remember making phone calls?? Ha..It has enough features to keep us satisfied like the calendar for keeping track of appointments, the pill reminder alarms, the tip calculator, regular calculator and voice commands..It has a lot of stuff we don't need like, internet, email, messaging, ect..Signal strength is great all the time, but we have a great cell tower structure here. The battery lasts a good long time and the voices sound just fine, clear and sharp. I think too many people want to get a FREE phone and then expect it to wipe their butts for them. It is a really good basic phone and with the ability to have large keys and large fonts, it's a good phone for old folks.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Basic Phone", "Author": "Sundog", "ReviewID": "R1M4PC9X9B043S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My goal for a phone is a good quality basic phone, that gets good reception, makes clear calls at an affordable price.  To be clear, I am looking for a phone that functions well as a phone and I am not reviewing other functions that are so popular to use phones for these days.I can say, this phone fills these requirements fine!  I do not have full bars at my home, but calls have been crisp clear, both using the ear piece and with the speaker phone.  I have to respectfully disagree with the reviewer that says that her calls are garbled.  Perhaps there is a flaw in that particular phone since I am not experiencing this at all.  At worst, the calls are slightly tinny, but still clear, understandable, loud enough and I have used many phones much worse than this.  I live in an area with poor cell coverage, and was worried that I would miss the strong reception that my Motorola Tundra was able to pull in.  Well, it has done fine with reception.  I have to say that I have had bars in some very difficult locations and am very pleased.  I'm not having a problem with battery life, but again, I'm not doing a bunch of fancy stuff with my phone; just using it as a phone.While this phone seems to be marketed to the \"elderly\", I am not yet a senior.  I just want a simple phone that does one thing well; make phone calls.  This does have some of the extras, and as usual, they feel very extra and not needed, such as the 3 buttons on top for shortcuts.  After programing these to my frequently called numbers, I realized they require two steps (push the short cut key, then the send key).  It is easier just to use the regular speed dial buttons.  I do like having the Breeze Mode that gives you a simple menu.  I used the advanced mode to adjust my settings the way I want them, then switch it to Breeze Mode for every day use.  I can easily switch to advanced mode if I want to, but the short menu is handy for day to day use.  As far as quality, this phone seems good.  Now, understand, my last phone was a Tundra, big tough thing!  This seemed thin, and light in comparison, but it does not feel cheap.  It has a solid feel to it, buttons work well although I would prefer them raised more rather than flush.  They are roomy enough and responsive, so I think I will get used to the different feel.  I am adding a silicone case to help protect this phone.  While it doesn't seem really delicate, I'm also not delicate, and like to not worry about drops, scratches and such!  The only reason I am giving the phone  a 4 star instead of a 5 star review, is although it works well, its just not that exciting either. I still will say its a good choice for a basic phone, and not sorry I got it.In conclusion, if you are looking for a good functioning phone as a PHONE (has anyone noticed most CNet reviews don't even address how a cell phone works as a PHONE anymore???!!  your choices are getting slimmer every day.  I say snatch this one up while you can.  I believe this is the highest quality simple phone att offers now.  Ok, its perhaps the ONLY simple phone they offer, but thank goodness the quality is there!  We are a forgotten breed in the cell phone market.  Hey, and big kudos to att for dropping the long list of att contacts that you can't delete.  They are now compiled under one contact, and near the bottom.  So, here's a toast to the last simple phone!  If you still want simple, basic phones, best speak up or they will all be gone soon!", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy to use.", "Author": "Lane", "ReviewID": "RSPJU5G7IND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Breeze mode is great.

Good choice for seniors that want to push one of three big buttons that gets there son or sister on the phone.Its good for about three hours of talk time. Not bad but a 2nd battery is always a good idea. Very easy to swap out the battery.

Some sellers are not aware yet that Pantech came out with a Breeze 3 and they are getting it mixed-up with the Breeze 2 version thinking they both use the same battery. Not so.

Occasionally I take photos with the phone and the quality is decent.My big complaint is transferring files (photos) from the phone to a PC or other device. I never got Bluetooth to work (with or without PC Suite). It pairs with a laptop, iTouch, and iPad, but says \"Connection failed\" or \"not supported\" when you try to Send files. The At&t; rep thought the Bluetooth might be only for a headset, but the manual clearly states that you can Send files.Mixed results using the USB cable included with the phone. First of all you need to obtain PC Suite specifically for the Breeze III from the pantechusa.com web site [...]. Apparently PC Suite doesn't work with Windows 7 (or maybe 64-bit Windows 7?).

This is the right size, buttons don't get bumped, and has a decent amount of weight without being clunky.The inside screen is of decent size for this type of phone.Display text size is adjustable (for those of us with aging eyes).Takes decent enough photos (it is after all, still a phone)lighted notification icons on outside of phone... easy to see if you have a call or text. don't have to pic up or open phone.Call quality is good.What I don't like: Most have to do with textingThe contact list isn't alpha.  How stupid is that?! I've looked all over the phone, and had younger persons look all over the phone... no alpha. Even if you press the first letter or two of a contact's name, it may or may not come up.  First name, last name, the phone just kind of picks and chooses. VERY Annoying.Switching from T9 to numeric etc requires pushing several buttons, and then pressing again to switch back. So if I have to note a meeting time or whatever, it is very cumbersome.I haven't found a way to intentionally add words to dictionary. For one example of many instances, my daughter's name is Elise. I cannot enter that name. I have to enter, letter by letter and the letter \"i\" is entered as a capital  so it always looks like elIse, which looks weird on text.Even though I have selected a larger text for viewing, most of the texting displays are small... a little too small.Bottom line, good basic phone, but if you ever text, or have a list of more than 5 contacts, can be a bit annoying.

This phone is intended to meet that market.  It does not come with fancy applications, and its feature set is about as basic as they come.  Nevermind that pressing almost any button at any time will cause a sorry excuse for a web browser to launch, almost certainly incurring fees on any phone plan that does not include data.  Nevermind that its menu system is incredibly brain-damaged and fails to live up to the standard of barebones phones of even a few years ago.  OK, so the phone is intended to generate data revenue and has a shoddy feature set; that's *FINE* for those of us who just want a basic phone.The problem is that even as a basic phone this product fails miserably!  The audio quality can be so poor that conversation becomes almost impossible.  I'd love to use a nice wired handset to make up the difference, but in the unceasing war on standardized phone plugs, purchasing one that actually fits this phone is nearly impossible.Seriously.  If you're looking at this phone, go with something like a Go phone instead.

I don't really care about music, ringtones, videos, cameras, etc..First off, the physical layout befuddles me. I cannot stand having the 'voice recognition' and camera buttons where I am expecting the call and end buttons. I constantly press the volume up/down buttons on the side during use--I had my phone completely silent for the first week of ownership. The numeric buttons in general do not have a good feel, they  feel sluggish and unreliable.The software gets even worse. You know those three short cut keys on the top  half of the flip phone? Well, those are useless because you can only assign 9 pre-determined options to. You get things like pill reminder, alarm, tip calculator, and junk. You cannot set it to something like inbox or recent calls. Even worse is that once you press a shortcut button you need to confirm that is what you wanted to do.I'm used to predictive text on my Nokia. I press five keys and it tries to guess a five letter word. If it doesn't know it I can have the phone learn the word. On the Pantech Breeze if I press five keys it will try to guess four and six letter words before it even shows my legit five letter word. I don't know how to make it learn new words. It doesn't have the word 'scum' in it's dictionary.This phone attempts to do some kind of multitasking. If you go to a function that is considered an 'application' the phone will keep it in the memory unless you press the right key combination to fully exit it. If you don't the application stays in memory and eventually you'll get messages about not being able to more than 3 applications at the same time. There is no way to manage what applications are running unless you try to open more than three. Anything that is considered an application is useless, because they're things like email, instant messaging, and some kind of application manager. And I'm not sure what the application manager is, but it's never opened for me, it just sits there and twiddles it's thumbs. maybe it's download a bunch of stuff from the network or maybe it really doesn't do anything. Either way you lose.All of the games are 'trials' and over complicated.With that said, I would be able to look past all the negatives, except I have a hard time understanding what people are saying on this phone. I tried to have a conversation with my wife that consisted of me saying 'what' and 'excuse me' at least once in response to everything she said. On top of that I have been told that I am more difficult to understand on this phone. And for me this is the deal breaker.

At that time, the iPhone was in its second iteration, but I bought the first generation to save some money. It is a SPECTACULAR device that does all sorts of awesome things. Sadly, it does not function well as a telephone! What was worse, for me, was that making an emergency call took too many steps.

We're 31/32.  It's a decent basic easy to use phone.  When I called him the other day and he was on a military island 3000 miles away on a land line, the call was crystal clear and I hadn't been able to hear someone that well over the phone in a very long time - it was very surprising in a good way.  When I talk to him and we're both on this phone, the call quality is pretty bad.  He has a really hard time talking to his mom on this phone and having her hear him well and understand what he's saying and it frustrates them both a lot so he calls her a lot less often than he used to (she's on a cell phone as well during these calls).  When I talk to my mom on this phone, it's decent but not great; I really have to make an effort to speak clearly (this is her cell phone to mine).  The speaker phone quality is not good and is hardly usable.  The only thing I cared about when I was phone shopping was call quality (and SAR value, and this phone is great in terms of low radiation), and it's frustrating that it's so hard to find a good basic cheap phone with good call quality.  It really shouldn't be this hard.  Basic cell phones were better 10 years ago than they are now, probably by design.If you don't go to AT&T; and tell them to turn off the data plan and text messaging plan, you will get all kinds of extra charges from accidentally hitting something that will charge you.  It's very expensive.  At least they allow you to opt-out of that and will refund the money if you complain.I don't like that AT&T; won't let you pay your cell phone bill by credit card.  I had to link it to my bank account.  I'd prefer to earn the points and then pay my credit card bill off right away.  Not a huge thing but I could pay my T-Mobile bill by credit card and I preferred that.Update 6/27/13- We've had this phone for awhile now, and I'd give it maybe 3 stars but no more.

But the really annoying thing is that it begins to save the words you \"added\" including any numbers you ever typed (by holding down the keys longer), so that eventually you cannot text anything at all except numbers.  All your keys are numbers first and will match the numbers saved in the \"my words\" list.  What is that about?  I had to spend over an hour deleting all the numbers from the \"my words\" list.  It is now possible to send text using T9 again. But I'll have to keep cleaning out the list because I often type dates, times, street numbers, phone numbers, etc. when I text.  Also, it saves punctuation into the \"my words\" so that if your child is named Gerty and you ever text'd \"Gerty's\" then next time you'll default to the possessive form.  Further nuisance is that in T9, when you get to the spelling you want, if you type another character it will revert the word you selected to the default (textonym).  An example is type 87825 for \"truck\" and the default is \"usual\".  So you use the up/down arrows to select \"truck\", then add a period or anything without spacing or using the right arrow to advance the cursor, and you revert back to \"usual.\" with the period or other typing added.

The breeze mode offers no choice of ring tones, and the one ring tone you get is really lame.  Texting always starts in \"ABC\" mode instead of \"predictive\" mode, so you always have to switch modes before you start a text.  It can't remember any of your habits or preferences, nor can they be programmed.  As far as I can tell, you can not add words to its dictionary for future use in predictive mode.  If you ever want to end a sentence with ellipsis (...) or finish a sentence with an emoticon (e.g. \". :)\") you have to hit options, left arrow on \"input mode\", scroll down and select \"symbols\", then move the arrow buttons select a \".\" or a \":\" or a \")\" and then hit \"insert\".

The ring tone not being very loud is not quite the right fit for the older set.

I figured soon there would be no non-smartphones to buy for an AT&T; plan and thought this would be a good time to update our simple non-smartphones.  My mother loved the original Pantech Breeze (in white), but didn't like this one despite its similarity.  I hate it.My hearing is not that bad, but I am getting older and I find I need to turn up the volume over the years.  This Pantech Breeze II has very low volume and I could barely hear callers even with the volume turned all the way up.  Answering the phone is a nightmare because of the prominently placed volume rocker buttons on the left.  I would hit those blasted buttons and either put the phone into silent mode, accidentally hang up on the caller, or reduce the headset volume to nearly zero every time I opened the flip to answer the phone.It is almost impossible to call a person from your contact list in less than four button pushes.  What is up with that ?  How can you make it so hard to call someone ?  Isn't that what a cell phone is used for ?  Did I mention I hate this phone ?  I am a geekette and don't have any problem modifying a phone to fit my needs and can usually adjust to most menu approaches on phones.  The Pantech Breeze II seems to make a challenge out of seeing how many button pushes it can make you do to do the simplest of tasks.I finally killed the phone, much to my relief.  I slipped this phone next to my skin under some clothing while I walked the dogs and I was expecting an important call.  Some phones are more sensitive than others to moisture, and this one is a complete sissy when it comes to moisture.  Sure enough the little white dots under the battery cover were bright pink after a 10 minute walk. So I ruined the phone within two weeks.  I had done this with my Sony Ericsson with no issues for YEARS.  Yes, it was my fault, so I am not blaming Pantech, and my mother gladly gave me her Pantech Breeze II which I used for a few months until I absolutely couldn't stand it anymore.I went back to my old Sony Ericsson W580i.  Now I am obligated to two more years of AT&T; less than great service which stinks.  Worst thing I could have done since I was off contract for years prior to this.
