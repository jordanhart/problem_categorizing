It is far and away the best smart phone I have used.  I traded up from a Samsung Rogue but have used several different smart phones including the iPhone.  The first and best feature is the screen.  It is huge and the image is beyond clear.  As I grow older I find being able to see and read the screen becomes more important to me.As a phone, it does everything I need.  I would prefer a slide-out keyboard but I am adapting to the on-screen typing.  I am also finding that I LOVE the speech to text feature.  I use it constantly for everything from filling out forms in the internet to entering address into the navigator.  The 4-G connection is very fast, even in the rural area where I live and work.  I had read reviews complaining about the battery life when using the smart phone features but I am having no trouble using the phone all day without recharging and I USE all features of the phone.On the negative side, the phone as shown  a tendency to lock up with certain apps, mostly from Google.  Since it is easy to reboot or remove the battery I don't view this as a deal breaker but it could become annoying.  Fortunately it does not do so very often.  That is the only gripe I have with it.I would highly recommend this phone to anyone, even an iPhone junkie like my wife.Update: 6/25/2013:  I have owned this phone for one year now and it just keeps getting better.  I have taken it on  numerous trips to cities I have never visited before and the navigation and search features function flawlessly.  It knows where restaurants, entertainment venues, gas stations, and any other service are located.  In other words, \"the phone is wise\".  The battery still lasts a full day even under what I would call heavy use.  It works as a geo-cache tracker, GPS unit, and tracks my bike rides and jogging progress flawlessly.  I have yet to find anything that this phone won't due.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just got it!", "Author": "Theodoric58", "ReviewID": "R2VE48JSOJXJ0F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone blows everything else I've used out of the water.

Huge upgrade from my Google G2. New Google software seems very fast and smooth. Great camera and the AMOLED display is the best I've seen.4G LTE is very fast, WHEN I'm connected to it. I find this phone to be on 3G most of the day. My location? Miami, FL which brings me to this complaint I filed with Verizon and Amazon Wireless:On January 11th 2013 I switched to Verizon Wireless after spending the previous 7 years with their direct competitor. The main reason for my switch was Verizon's marketing and promise of a more reliable & stronger network. I purchased the a Samsung Galaxy S III and as a loyal Amazon Prime member, I did so with confidence and was excited that I had saved $50 off the current Verizon Wireless promotional price.After using the phone for several days I noticed some technical issues with the device. After spending several hours of my time with the Verizon Wireless technical department, it was determined that this phone was defective (not connecting to the network properly). I was assured by the Verizon Wireless technical specialist that under Verizon's worry-free guarantee, a new phone would be sent free of charge but that I had to contact Amazon Wireless directly in order to process the guarantee.When I contacted Amazon Wireless I was informed that there was only 2 options for replacing this phone. Amazon Wireless does not honor any Verizon guarantees and they have their own policy's. The first option was to ship this defective device back, thus SURRENDERING MY SERVICE and going without a phone for 5-6 days while they \"process\" the return. The second option is to pay the FULL RETAIL PRICE of $699, wait 3-4 days for the replacement, and then get a refund 7-10 days after Amazon Wireless received the defective device back.Let's recap:Option 1 = No phone for 5-6 days while you ship yours back and then wait for a replacementOption 2 = Pay $699 + shipping to get a replacement, refund in 7-10 days after they receive defectiveWhen I brought up the fact that the Verizon tech department had informed me otherwise, I was told by the Amazon Wireless representative that \"They'll say anything to get you off the phone\". I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told nothing else could be done. Both replacement options are clearly unrealistic and unacceptable. Amazon Wireless refused to replace the defective equipment that they sent me.Beware that Amazon wireless is separate division and they do not operate under the same guidelines as Amazon. Customer service is marginal at best and they will not budge on this policy. Both replacement options that Amazon Wireless presented to me reflect poorly on the Amazon brand. I would strongly suggest buying this phone at a Verizon Wireless corporate retail store.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressive Smartphone", "Author": "Michael Paul Sebek", "ReviewID": "R191KFWK4GICGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased three of these phones to outfit the family.  In a word, they are terrific.  The phones operate flawlessly, and have a host of features, \"apps,\" and \"widgets\" that are not only cool, but make organizing and accomplishing necessary daily tasks and routines much easier.  The phone is very elegant and stylish, but we have all three cocooned inside Otterbox cases that we purchased from Amazon.  I thought this was a much less expensive alternative than the $11 per month PER PHONE that Verizon wanted to charge for insurance. Only time will tell if this was a good decision, but as of now we are very satisified with the phones and its accessories (all of which we purchased from Amazon).

The phone is great. It was a major upgrade over my last phone the T-Mobile G2x (LG) and my work phone the Droid X2. I'd say my favorite feature improvement is the ability to add emergency numbers that the phone can call when it is locked. I like the idea of a paramedic knowing who to call if I were ever in a car accident. The phone is thin enough that putting the right case on it is no big deal, the phone will still fit easily in my pocket.The Verizon security app bogged the phone down and didn't work well.

I bought the 16 gb version (11 gb available for my use) and a 32gb SD card, but the external SD can only be used for storage of pictures, video or music files.  Can't place or run any of your apps on the external SD.  They also made it much more difficult to access the phone via your USB cable.  On my previous (HTC EVO 4G ) phone I could access the SD card like an external disk drive and easily transfer files back and forth.  This phone treats your external SD as an afterthought.  The carrier and manufacturer are certainly making it more of a necessity for us non-geeks to explore rooting, although I understand that Jelly Bean 4.1.1 has made that a little more difficult, but that will change as the devs have more time to explore.

To me getting a new phone always feels so refreshing but as you use it over time you start to realize that you need more power.  While I've become quite familiar with the SIII performance I've never found it to be lacking in speed.  My only complaint would have to be that the SIII's battery life is at most just average.

But so far, after about 4 days with the phone, that's my only quibble, aside from the built in TouchWiz launcher, which isn't awful, but just annoying enough to make you want to seek one of the many free options available.  The phone is fast, the display is large and beautiful (be sure to set the display to full brightness if using the phone in daylight, otherwise it's impossible to see).  I was one of those 'old-schoolers' who always wanted the security of a mechanical keyboard option, but the amazing SwiftKey app keyboard/text predictor app (along with the size of the S III's screen) renders irrelevant all of my concerns about typing accuracy with touchscreen keyboards.

The camera takes pretty good pictures from both front and back.  The videos it takes are 1920x1080, which is HD quality.  Granted, my Canon HD video camcorder and my Canon SLR are better, but for a phone this is the best I've seen.  The flash also stays on as an assistive light, and it is very bright.  Will be very handy in a power failure, or when searching for something in my black hole of a purse.  My previous phone was a Huawei Ascend II, and it was a little put putt in comparison.  This phone leaves that one in its dust.  The only small inconveniences are the placement of the on and volume buttons.  It is also hard to grasp it when taking photos without hitting the back button, unless you are holding the camera in a landscape aspect.

I bought it because i was due for an upgrade and decided that I wanted everything (phone calls, texts, emails, pictures, music, etc) all under one roof so to speak. At the time, I had one of the first internet accessible phones for calls/texts, a digital camera for pictures, and an iPod Touch for music. This is my first smart phone, so i might be a little biased in saying that, when I bought this phone in March 2013, it is the best smart phone out there. It's super light. RAM speed is fast. There aren't any random glitches that I've noticed mother's iPhone has. It's been almost 6 months that I've had my phone and, sad to say, I think I would be devastated if something happened to it. Luckily for me, I bought an Otter Box for the phone too (no, it's not too bulky with the Otter Box Commuter) so now this phone is pretty much unstoppable!The reason i bought the phone through Amazon was the price. Through Verizon's website it was almost $200 and that's with my updgrade. I got the phone for under $100. So thank you Amazon for your awesome-ness on that one.Shipping was fast. I think I received the phone within 2 days of ordering.Lastly, I would reccomend this phone to anyone and everyone. If you've never used an Android device before and are concerned about it being difficult to use compared to your beloved iPhone.. trust me when I say, you will not miss your iPhone after 1 day with the Galaxy. If you're an older person and not that computer savvy, the Galaxy offers a wonderful \"Starter Mode\" so you can get used to all of the options surrounding customizing the Galaxy, little by little (yes, Apple lovers, you can customize EVERYTHING on this phone: app icons, colors, keyboards, widgets --mini programs that display stuff like the weather, new texts, FB statuses, task lists, etc).All in all, if you're reading this review you are probably interested in buying an Android phone. I say go with the Galaxy S III (or the S IV because I've heard that it's actually more awesome than the S III --If that's even possible).

It started to slow WAY down(taking 5 seconds just to bring up the keyboard to type something), and would randomly lock up to the point of needing to take the battery out. So, yesterday it just locked up and when it went to boot back up it got stuck on the \"samsung galaxy sIII\" screen. So after a few more battery removals it just completely died. Won't even turn on.  I tried switching the battery out with my wife's phone, but obviously that didn't work. So, here I am only halfway through my 2yrs and I'm having to revert back to my trusty droidx that is still running strong after 3 years.So, moral of the story is...keep your old phone, because chances are you will be needing it sooner or later before your contract is up.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy S III", "Author": "Larry Hoezee", "ReviewID": "R34ZPIMAWFOTDM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The learning curve was possible with the help of a work colleague.

Keeps a charge all day also plus its a cinch to swap batteries, essential for traveling.  And the batteries are cheap, $9!  Just does EVERYTHING a little bit better than anyone else.  I will say this apples camera is better. Why does apple so dominate the camera thing?  Or why can't Samsung get Sony to make its camera? If apple would ever make a light 5 inch screen phone they might compete, but until then, apple 5s, droid maxx and htc one are all jokes by comparison.

I had three Samsung TV's fail in two months, a DVD player that always hangs, and a monitor that died in just 16 months.  Now the same goes for the Galaxy S III.  The first one died in one week.  Would boot, not even with exernal power.  Second unit failed with the same symptoms.  Took it to Verizon.  The manager said it had water damage, even though it had never been in water.  Spoke to a Verizon Tech who directed me to look at the moister indicators.  The one under the battery was slightly pink (I had to continually remove the battery and re-insert it to get it to boot).  All the rest were not triggered.  Notes in the Verizon tech file said \"extensive water damage\" and used words like dripping.  I think this situation is like medical insurance companies automatically denying 95% of claims and hoping to outlast the claimants life or will.  Not in this case.  I am a professional reliability engineer and know what causes component failure.  I have dealt with Samsung as a supplier and have heard many tales of releasing product with inadequately tested SW (either form them or suppliers), inadequate ESD controls and bad design.  I am sending to phone back to Samsung for failure analysis, demanding proof of water damage.  When it comes back negative I would like to solicit for a class action suit against Samsung and Verizon for this type of behavior.  A new phone is $600 and Verizon will not make concessions.  Sure you can cancel your contract - it will cost you $600 and when you don't pay your credit score.  It is time to stand up agains the gready corporations.  Use you options, buy wisely.  For me, this was my last Samsung product - EVER.  Unless consumers demand it by going elsewhere, companies will continue to believe that they can cut costs and increase share holder value by cutting quality in order to deliver products faster and cheaper.  Sorry, but $600 is too much for a product that only lasts two months.UPDATE:  In the process of investigating the possibility of a class action against Samsung, I have noted a number of States already have class actions filed over hidden and uncorrected known defects in the Galaxy S. If you have one of these phones, do you research and join a class action.  Protect consumers from corporations that ship defective products and then use the defects as a source of revenue by making false claims of environmental damage.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Neither a phone nor a computer", "Author": "Faramarz Rabii", "ReviewID": "RMXNLW24PIKM0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just to be clear I am a computer professional and use them every day. I am used to large screens and high quality keyboards. I also have large and somewhat clumsy fingers. I have also used other smart phones with similar results.I got this \"smartphone\" in January with a good promotion deal. I figured it will be useful for an occasional web access and make email reading simpler. I was wrong.The device is quite large for a phone. So it is not easy to slip in my pocket and carry. Next the touch screen makes it very hard for me to get use. I had to buy a stylus just to be able to use the virtual keyboard. I did some research and found there are keyboards that I can buy as accessories. The problem is that I will then have yet another large item added to the device and the stylus. On top of this I have to pay 30 $ more a month for a data plan.What do I get for all this? For me the answer is not much good but a lot of annoyance.* My old regular phone had email so I get no improvement.* The smartphone is bigger and therefore harder to carry.* The smartphone has a ton of apps which I do not need. For example games: if I wanted to play a video game I rather use my regular monitor.* The old phone had both touch and a keyboard this one has just an over sensitive touch screen which I have to treat like an egg shell. If it breaks I am out of luck.* It is very easy to activate the wrong app by mistake.* The old phone sound quality was better and had better reception.* The smartphone is preset to make an assortment of annoying sounds which I had to spend my valuable time de-configuring.* For web browsing the combination of small screen and touch makes it a non starter for me. I much rather use a full sized screen with a regular keyboard.* It is too big for a phone and too small for a web browser.I am still trying to figure out what the pluses are but have not found any yet.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nor pleased!", "Author": "Bill Pitt", "ReviewID": "R1EPSCUMFY9J5B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "O.K. So I'm 65 and use to a regular cell flip phone. But friends said you have to move up Bill.  Get the next generation of cell phone.  Be \"Smart.\"  Read your Email.  Connect to the internet.

They were friendly and offered me free classes. Classes?  I just want to make a phone call and get my calls and messages.  I need classes?I purchased a 400 page manual, but there are just to many steps. And it seems that there are simple things I could do on my flip phone I can't do on this quickly or just be able to do. Plus the battery life is just terrible! Have to charge it almost every other day.So the SIII is hard to use and just not user friendly for me. For others more adapt at small computer devices maybe it's O.K.  Also, I have a car charger but my blue tooth keeps disconnecting. I miss my simple flip phone and think I'll go back.

I used it when I first received the product and it worked.  I stored in my garage according to the very limited English version of the manual I found on the internet (it ships with a manual that is in German) and have not been able to get this to run for more than 5 minutes at a time.  I'm faced with taking this to the repair shop which will no doubt cost me more money than its worth for this Chinese piece of junk.  I'm going to cut my losses and buy the Hitachi system like I should have in the first place.May 5th, 2013This is a follow up to my previous review.  I feel compelled to be fair and update my previous negative review of this product, not the seller who doesn't support the product after the sale, but just the product itself.As my review above indicates after first using this product one time last fall when I first received it I was unable to get the trimmer to start this spring after storage.  I followed the English version of the manual which I found at [...].  This site also sells this same unit but they are in Canada and the freight was a bit too rich for me at the time.  However, this site does have the English version manual, not German as does this seller and the Canadian company (see url above)supports the unit with replacement parts and great \"how to\" videos.  Upon further investigation into the source of my starting problem I did a rather extensive search on the web and YouTube and talked to the local small engine repair service.  I had no idea how harmful and destructive the ethanol gasoline is to 2 cycle engines. I decided to do the tune up myself which typically consists of changing the spark plug, fuel filter (found in the unit's gas receptacle) and the air filter. When I replaced the fuel filter I found the problem, that was, the gas line from the carburetor to the fuel filter had split and therefore no gas was reaching the carburetor.  I went to the Ace Hardware, bought 1 foot of new line, a couple fuel filters for $1.25 each and a bottle of TruFuel, 50:1 mix ratio.  I concluded the gasoline with ethanol and oil mix was causing a lot of my problem with the system.  After changing the plug, new fuel lines (the line to the gasoline receptacle from the squeeze bulb also split) and new fuel filter I then added some TruFuel.  It took about 5 pulls and the unit fired up and ran great.  I let it run for about 5 minutes and I'm now a believer in TruFuel.I hope this helps.  Saying all this, I was penny wise and pound foolish.  If I had this to do over, I would buy the Husqvarna 128DJx 17-Inch 28cc 2-Stroke Gas Powered Straight Shaft String Trimmer/Brush Cutter with Detachable Shaft and the Troy build compatible attachments which fit and are much less expensive.  The Troy Built attachments are available at Lowe's and should be available at Amazon. While this would cost about $150 more than the cheaper Chinese 4 in 1 system I think in the long run you'd have a better product that is easier to maintain with parts and service.Hope that helps.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheaply made phone with shoddy workmanship", "Author": "Sunmaid12", "ReviewID": "R3CO5Q951XTHNO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Working in technology gave me the opportunity to use this first hand along with the Apple iPhone 5.
