It's biggest problem seems to be a lack of battery power, but in part that's because it has some real power using features including GPS and a brilliant touch screen.  But for someone like me, who is simply replacing by dumb gophone, I've added a GPS, an MP3 player, a WIFI enable internet browser, and any android ap that I want, all without having to spend more than $8 bucks a month I currently spend for my emergency phone.  In fact, I was able to simple switch my SIM card--easy--and I even kept my phone number and cash balance.  I do not do data, but rely on WI-FI for surfing the internet.For people who can't justify for themselves spending hundreds if not thousands on a phone over the course of a contract, this is a fabulous way to go!!!!", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pantech Crossover Go Phone", "Author": "James A. Marusek", "ReviewID": "RC79GK1A755OT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone works fine.  It meets my expectations.  There was no $25 Airtime Credit.  But Amazon made good by crediting my account for the amount of the credit.We live out in the boonies.  As a result we have zero bars on the cell phone, that is why we do not own a cell phone but rely on a landline phone.  But it is nice to have a portable phone when we are up and about.  We use a go-phone and that works well except there is no reception near our house.I heard that Blackberry/iPhones type phones can get better reception.  So I thought it was worth giving this type of phone a try as a second go-phone (for the wife) so we can find each other when we are separated in the mall or large mega store.  Well it worked.  I can now even get one or two bars at my home.I talked to the AT&T; representative and he said this type of phone can take advantage of the newer towers and that is why the reception is better than a normal go-phone.There was no $25 airtime credit even though it is clearly identified on the box.  I followed the directions given in the instructions.  The credit should have appeared within an hour after phone activation, except it didn't.  When you call AT&T;, you need to have the phone's IMEI number handy.  This is buried inside the phone.  You need to remove the battery to see it.  AT&T; uses this number to determine if the phone has a credit or not.  I found out later that sometimes phones are part of a promotion but after the promotion is over the credits disappear.  The buyer (in this case Amazon) may be unaware that the purchased phones no longer support the promotion's airtime credit.  Thus the mix-up.  Amazon refunded a credit for the lost airtime minutes.  So all worked out in the end O.K. except it takes time to work through the problem.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Entry/Mid Range Android", "Author": "kdh", "ReviewID": "R1M31Q1NXL67EK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I still have 6 months left on my contract with ATT, and wouldn't you know it, the screen crapped out on my HTC Aria. I tried to get by with a Palm Pixi, but there are just too many Android applications that I have become dependent on. At this price, the crossover is a fine replacement for an entry level Android device. It's no dual core, spec monster power house, but considering the original Iphone had a 412mhz processor and 128mbs of ram, for $120.00 you get a 600mhz processor and 384mbs of ram. There is only 512mbs of storage, which equates to a little over 400mbs for market apps. With an adequate micro sd, you will be able to load many apps and store lots of basic video, pictures, music, etc.... If you want a device to play games, stream a lot of video, and are expecting high definition, I would consider something else. Since it has lower specs , expect to manage tasks responsibly, or else you will have some periods of screen unresponsiveness.I may keep this even after my contract is up, it does everything I need a smartphone to do, and I have a nice tablet for fun.

Maitland \"Austin\"", "ReviewID": "R2VX1VFILDDB0Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone with the hopes of ditching my ipod touch which I always carried around with me mostly for the wifi capabilities, alongside my existing Gophone.  This is a very solidly built Android which could easily be mistaken for a rugged device.  The phone's screen is really quite impressive as it is glass rather than plastic, and although it is slightly smaller than some other Androids, (3.1 in.) it retains a 320x480 pixel density which more than makes up for the lost size with clarity and sharpness.  The music player is great and sounds just as high quality as my old ipod.  The processor can't compete with some of the newer more expensive devices, but for an $80 GoPhone, it works perfectly fine and doesn't hinder my experience at all.  It's great having access to the Google Play Store to get some simple time-killing apps.  The real highlight of the phone is its ability to combine my email and web browsing needs into one device that doesn't even require a data plan!  The camera also takes really nice pictures for just being 3mp.  Spectacular option for those looking for a great, solid, well-rounded GoPhone!!! To focus on the negatives, it's a little thick and heavy.  Personally I like it more because of it's incredibly sturdy and solid design.", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's not bad at all, it's just not great.", "Author": "Thowe Ritsie", "ReviewID": "R3SHPENG4OJ9DP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone obviously features the android platform which, in itself, is a 5 star product. The apps you can get for no cost whatsoever are fantastic, and it is worth noting that the phone has no trouble accessing these or anything else on the web, aside from insanely small text presentations at first. You'll have to zoom in on 80% of the content you browse, but all in all, it does seem worthwhile. The only problem with this version of android is it's definitely well beyond outdated at this point, and it will not be changing at any point in time. This means a lot of the newer programs are totally incompatible and you're totally SOL if you want to get firefox on this phone.The phone itself makes computers of last century look like dirt. Compare it to it's contemporaries and you'll find it's moreso on the average point in the spectrum. The user interface can be intimidating for new smart phone owners, but it does become rather fluid before long. It's at that point you begin to notice the speed shortage. For one thing, the accelerometer (thingy that makes the screen display correctly whether you're holding it sideways or upside down) seems to have a REALLY hard time keeping up. A lot of times the screen will display incorrectly after unlocking the phone for some reason. It's not a huge problem, but it definitely cheapens the experience.The speed while browsing through menus is relatively good. I've found programs load slower than web content, which seems a bit odd, considering the difference between local and VERY distant files, but it is what it is. This includes, and isn't limited to, the most basic of functions, including the phone function itself. It may take several seconds to open up the dialing interface or make an actual call. That said the calls aren't pitch perfect by any means, but it does get the job done well enough. I've never experienced static or any kind of echo effects like I have in other phones. The speaker phone is a bit quiet and difficult to use in a room with any noise at all. Both speaker, and earpiece have a very trebly tone that can be a bit abrasive, so you may want to dial it down a little before using the earpiece.The camera is pretty mediocre and it has no flash. But for all intents and purposes it is functional in most situations. The most endearing feature of this phone for me is the slide out keyboard. I hate onscreen keyboards. They don't work with my fingers. So the real keyboard is very satisfying, considering my use, or overuse, of texting. The buttons are large enough and well labeled and the function keys are simple and easy to get used to. It does light up as well, so in a dark room it's just as easy to use. The touch screen itself is just OK. It's better than I thought it would be, but smaller icons are extremely annoying to actually activate for me. Seems like touch screens just hate big fingers.Despite what you may perceive the above to mean, I do think this is an excellent device. You'd have to be pretty ungrateful for the leaps technology has taken to be able to ignore the fact that you have the internet in your pocket with speeds that make aol and even some forms of dsl look like turtles in quicksand. For the true yuppies out there, you're probably not going to be satisfied with a phone that doesn't have a bat signal or an on call helicopter, but for the regular folk looking for an awesome gadget, or the smart phone newbie looking to sample the market without signing a forever long contract, this will absolutely get the job done.*for the record, a 5 star phone would have both a bat signal AND an on call helicopter service*", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "Terra E. Whitmeyer \"terraelise\"", "ReviewID": "R3IW4BSS5DP1VT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Cons that keep it from 5 stars: the battery life is a bit short, the screen isn't the biggest.Meh's: you do have to fight for the $25 credit listed, I was on the phone with AT&T; for 15 min - she confirmed I could get it (via the IMEI barcode number from the packaging), but had trouble getting it onto the phone, but should have in the 'next hour'. It may not feel terribly fast, but it isn't totally slow either - plus I use Wi-Fi when at home which seems easier/saves data time. I don't keep it in front of my face all day, so I do need to remember to set email (i did hotmail, no issues) to never check automatically - otherwise you turn on the phone after a few hours to see a $3 data charge. sometimes i get random errors when using apps, but it doesn't seem to do anything / software doesn't crash.Pros: i love having a proper keyboard, as i can't manage to hit tiny screen keys properly and i'm normally a fast typer so screen keys and number keypad were too slow for me. I can 'text' like a 'normal' person now. haha. The screen, while it seems a bit small for what apps try to do with it (wish I could make the apps display 20% smaller), is very vibrant and pretty responsive / slick interface. Overall setup and features are easy and plentiful. I am also having success with the camera - for 3mp it takes well-balanced color shots perfect for web usage and easy to post to FB. I haven't tried to use it as a camcorder or it's other features. Had no problem moving over my SIM card from the puny Samsung flip phone.It's not a \"5-star\" amazing phone, but for the price + features + being a gophone it's pretty great and I'm very very happy.You will only have after-market cases and such, I had the best luck with the 'empire' stuffs (mine is bright pink and rubberized, though it does carry the 'empire' logo) - those cases stayed on/fit since they have a side of the 4 tabs that is on the corners thus keeping out of the way of the keyboard sliding action and the top/bottom of the cover (thus staying on well).UPDATE: eventually AT&T; made me use the new SIM card that came with the phone, but made sure info/settings/phone number stayed the same. They claim the old SIM isn't compatible and it was the reason I didn't get the credit. But they are calling me (3x so far) to work it out, so I'm also happy with the customer service.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with this purchase!!", "Author": "MzMoe", "ReviewID": "R1624UU9JGQVJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the item in record time. I read some of the previous reviews and saw that getting the credit might be a problem. So....I waited exactly 1 hour and then called AT&T;'s go phone c/s number. Spoke with a very knowledgeable and nice rep who was able to help me without much problem (all it took was her looking up the code I supplied to her which was right on the side of the box to see that a $25 credit was indeed due to me). She said it would take approx. 10 minutes to get onto my account and EXACTLY 10 minutes later she called me (on the # I provided to her) to tell me it was all done. It was that easy! She was even able to answer questions I had regarding the different rate plan options and the $25 credit was able to be used as my first month of the $25/mo. plan that I picked :-)  I know this review is primarily based on my experience getting the $25 credit, but seeing so many people comment about their problems, I just wanted to mention how fortunate I was to not have to experience similar negative issues.Re: the phone itself- so far, so good. I've only had it a day (purchased for my teen who will primarily use it to call/text only) and he's been able to navigate and use w/ ease. Its not the lightest phone, but that's okay w/ me. His last phone was so light, it felt like a toy! The battery lasted all day, but I'm sure if used the data/internet, the battery would drain quicker.Overall, I would def. recommend this phone, plan and pre-paid service provider.

I decided I wasn't going to give up until I received it, so I went ahead and ordered the phone. I received it promptly two days later. My initial impression of this phone is very good. It's nice looking & loaded with features. It seems solidly built, but not too large. I happen to love the slide out keyboard which has nice-size, easy to use keys. Seems like this phone will be easy to navigate, though I do need to read the user guide! I'll update my review later (if needed) as I become more familiar with this item.Now for the best part, I had absolutely no problem whatsoever getting the airtime credit! It's possible that \"porting\" your old number could cause a glitch in their system as you first need to activate your phone & receive an assigned phone number. You then call customer service(800 901-9878). Be sure to have your IMEI# & pass code available to give them. I got through to a agent quickly and told her I wanted to port my old number but also wanted her to check my account to ensure I would have the $25 credit. I did this within minutes of activating the phone. She transferred me to the dept. that handled that function but said she would stay on the line with me through the process to ensure the credit didn't disappear after changing the number. She did exactly that. She also walked me through the various plans that were available. Even though this is a smartphone, you do not need to have a data plan! Without the data plan you can still access the net as long as you're in a wireless zone. If you don't have that capability, you can get a data plan for as low as $5 a month as long as you have at least the $25 per month plan. If you opt for 10 cents a minute or the $2 per day option, you cannot purchase a data plan. You also can change your mind and opt in or out of data or phone plans as needed by calling customer service. As we speak, I'm using the $25 credit (without having added any additional funds) and am able to access the internet easily without a data plan.Hope this helps those of you who are considering this phone.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "not relable", "Author": "vcr/dvd buyer", "ReviewID": "R2IO5P1XWDFVGA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before picking the crossover.

What more can you ask for?  It works just fine with my ATT Go phone service.  ATT wanted $399 for this phone on line and in the store. They said it would be free if I bought a two year contract, but I didn't want a contract.Pros:  The price is marvelous,less than half the on line price.  Having a smart phone is a new learning experience for me.  But not only can I load Amazon Apps on it, but also Google Android Market.  So it is a win win.The keyboard is easy to use, they give you a CD manual, but I was up and running rather quickly without it.  The phone is heavier than some like.  I find it a good thing to be a little heavier.  For me it is a wonderful phone...a great price, and I couldn't ask for anything better for my go phone.Cons: I plugged my sims card in and it worked from the start.  The contacts though had to be re entered.I had saved them on my sims card, but they didn't copy over.  The Free ATT Address book is not available to go phone users.  I called and talked to them and they said only if you have a contract can you use it.But I did import the contacts to my SD card for future.  Everything works great with wi fi.  However the data plans required to use web when not in wi fi range are pretty lame.  The minimum is $5 for 540MB.  What can you do with that low a limit?  I didn't want to spend $25 a month...so I just got the $5 one. It lasts 30 days and its cost is deducted from whatever go phone card you have active.  I had the $100 for the year pre pay and it deducted $5 from it and asked if I wanted it to do auto renew every month.$25 air time free not there.  If you read the fine print the $25 air time is not for those that already have a number and a go service.  I didn't care though, the phone is still a great buy.

What I liked was that everyone on Amazon was complaining about not getting their $25, but no one seemed to have anything bad to say about the phone itself!  After having used it a little bit I see why, and I like it too.  I too have had problems getting my $25 credit though.  (!!!!)  I should add that this is my first smart phone and I am getting acclimated to this one just fine, whereas the other one was a giant nightmare.  I really would recommend this phone for anyone else trying to make the leap.Most important things I like:-- The slide-out keypad is easier to use than on touch screen only phones.  I know it makes the phone bigger, heavier and bulkier but to me it's worth it.  It's also nice to be able to really hang onto it (not like the light little touch-onlies) and not feel like you're going to break or drop it.  This phone has a solid feel.-- Unlike the Fusion, this phone has a \"face sensor\" so when you're on a call and you put the phone up to your ear, the screen turns off and you don't hang up on whoever you're talking to.  With other phones you have to get around this by pushing the on/off button, but who wants to have to remember to push extra buttons for something so simple?  Same with hanging up the call (on purpose): With the Crossover you pull it away from your face and push the touch button.  With the Fusion you'd have to turn the screen back on via the on/off button, and THEN hang up \"a second time\" via the touch screen.Other benefits:-- You don't have to turn Swype exclusively on and off from the settings menu to use it (with the Fusion you have to pick between Swype vs. tapping without by changing the actual settings in a whole different menu).-- The Voice Dial has worked better on this phone than the last.-- Dialing itself is easier because you can dial from the messaging screen and a few other fairly intuitive places.The two things I really dislike so far is that the speakerphone volume is so low it's virtually unusable -- but this seems to be ubiquitous between many smart phones.  And hooking up a Bluetooth headset takes an inordinate number of buttons, clicks, etc.  But overall this seems like a good, well-designed phone and I am once again excited about trying a smart phone.Hope this review helps; good luck on your search!", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "good replacement phone", "Author": "nic", "ReviewID": "R2788PL6KLHW73", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "my iphone was stolen and I was not eligible for an upgrade for a few months, I purchased this phone as a replacement in the meantime.

On the down side, I noticed several programs will not run on this, even if side loaded (they load, but run quirky).  It does have full access to play store, but again, some programs are not designed to run on this and do not appear.I have used nicer phones than this, but at a much higher price.  The keyboard is much, much better than I expected from reading (the keys are almost flush with the pad, but they have a much better tactile feel than you would think by looking at it).  The overall build is not bad either (I'd say average).  The weight and feel of it in my hands really just feels right.  It is a little heavy, but the size is nice.  I didn't like the shape of it when i saw it, but now I like it.  No problems connecting with wifi or 3g.  I'd even say a little above average as I can get a signal on it where other (better) phones would not.  Call quality is good.  The external speaker volume is a little low.  Has gps which works pretty well.  Also came with charger and charger for the car.I cannot say long term battery, as I have only had this for a day, but I was on it with wifi for several hours and seems about average from other phones I have used (not bad, not good).  The screen is responsive, but not the best I have used.  I like the extra \"app\" button.  The camera sucks, but all phone cameras do, in my opinion (average 3 megapixel cam).  Wish it had a front camera.  It only has 500mb total internal drive, and comes with a 2gb card which isn't labeled, but I'd rate it at class 4 or 6 from copying files to it.The $25 credit can be applied to existing gophone sims which I didn't know until i got it.  It says here only new phones, but on and in the box, it just says $25 credit.  They surely do not give you the credit right away.  I needed to dial the 800-901-9878 and kept hitting 0 until I got a rep.  They said they need to add this phone to your account and the $25 credit was on the IMEI and it would be credited, but takes a day.  I will see.  If not, I will try to get the $25 credit from Amazon as others have done.  I am even happy for this phone for $60, but for $35 + $25 credit, you really can't go wrong with this phone (even regular price of $80 is not bad if you get the $25 credit).  If I have issues getting this, I will update my review.If you missed out on this for $60, its worth $80 in my opinion.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone with a Sad Story", "Author": "Prashant P. \"Prashant P.\"", "ReviewID": "RIV4WXBB3LVTJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is nice and pretty good with the features and accessories.

It is great to see a nice mid range device for the prepaid crowd, since we mostly get downgraded phones or ones that are \"dumb phones\"  Most are over priced or the cheap smart phones have really low specs, really low.  Plus they are mostly touch screen, I prefer a keyboard I hate pecking away at screens, dealing with auto correct and smudges all over the place, blame that on my OCD as well personal prefrence.  This phone the Pantech Crossover from att, hits the spot, it gives me a sturdy slide out keyboard and the keys are big enough to register my fingers.  Perfect for big or small hands. Its also pretty lightweight and thin for a qwerty packing device, so kudos on that.  With just a 600 mhz processor, I have to say despite many reviews saying it lags or is slow, mine ran like a charm, fast and with tons of memory to spare ( keep in mind I installed an 8gb SD card, supports up to 32 ) You can move most apps over to that to create space, place your pictures and music on the SD card as well instead of phone memory. ALSO I LOVE A DEDICATED SIDE CAMERA BUTTON, yup it has it!The phone seems to works flawless in many areas such as calls, crystal clear, regardless of some saying that speaker is weak I am here to tell you coming from an HTC inspire ( WITH A WEAK TINY SPEAKER ) this thing is LOUD on full levels, alerts and calls come in clear and great YAY I can actually hear my phone again even over music, loud people, and the tv.  I use wifi to spare the data, and downloads are generally fast.  The phone CHARGES FAST which is awesome, and it seems to last most of all day with heavy to moderate use, this is due to a 1500 battery which is AWESOME to have in a smart phone of this size, since the phone has a little screen compared to others on the market, and just a 600 mhz instead of single or dual core processor speed, this helps to keep the battery full and everlasting, so that is a generous battery amount for a mid range android device.  The screen colors seem bright to me its no amoled or HVGA super screen, but it gets the job done just fine.  Works well on heavy to moderate use where I am not having to run around with my charger all the time. To me whats the sense in having a smart phone if its so big you cant fit in  your pocket, the battery goes so quick and drains, and you cant hear it ring, etc, thankfully this one feels in that void nicely.Its not so much sleek and sexy, but more manly and rugged, finally a Mans phone not saying a lady could not use it, just saying its durable, rugged, and has a cool futurisitic design to it.  I prefer something unique that will last if it falls or slips out of your hand, which I have that happen before.  I got a nice screen protector for it on amazon, you might need that to protect your screen from scratches and smudges.  The box comes with wall charger and a bonus car adapter which is very nice.The only complaint I had is when I took it out of the box, there was one dead pixel out on the screen, most probably would not see this or care, but me being somewhat young and a tech \"geek\" I noticed right away, this was handled very fast by amazon customer service and they are sending a replacement right away and paying for a prepaid label to send my current one back, so good job Amazon customer service!For the price 119.00 and free shipping that came in just 2 days, I really cant complain this once contracted only phone is awesome to finally become a go phone, in my opinion one of the nicest ones on the market IF you NEED A KEYBOARD, such as myself, Loving it so far, and the function key at the top is a great feature to have to get to apps quickly so you dont have to go searching on your phone for them.  One more note the camera yes is only 3 mega pixels, but let me tell you for what it is, very nice pictures in my opinion since it does have auto focus, something most att prepaid phones do NOT have.  Took great pictures outdoors and decent ones inside doors.  The camcorder isnt to bad either.  For what it is, a mid range device, I think it will live up to my expectations so I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a new smartphone with go phone.  I am thankful for this device \"crossing over\" to the att market, so far im happy with this phone and you should be to !", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Android Phone For the Price!", "Author": "John Smith", "ReviewID": "R1IOL0BX2M7L35", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone replaced my Windows Mobile 6.1 HTC Fuze (aka HTC Touch Pro for other carriers), and I could not be more pleased.  Let me begin by stating that the phone does NOT include a $25 airtime credit as advertised.  This was a promotion ran by AT&T; that has ended awhile back, so keep in mind this phone does not include any airtime money.  As other reviewers have stated, I e-mailed Amazon about this and within 24 hours they responded and are crediting $25 + tax back to my credit card that I used to pay for the order (this is even better imo, giving me $25 off the price of the phone!).  Now on to my review of the phone itself.  The phone specs a processor @ 600 Mhz, which is similar to the 566 Mhz of my previous phone, and I was expecting similar performance.  However, this phone blows my HTC Fuze away.  Not sure if it is hardware or the Android OS, but the Pantech Crossover outperforms my Fuze in every way.  Exceeds my expectations in every way.  Easy to use, and intuitive OS.  Very responsive touch screen allows me to easily swipe between 5 home screens, pinch to zoom, etc. No noticeable lag even when running processor-intensive apps such as GPS and Audio Player at the same time.  The slide-out keyboard has a great sturdy and spacious feel, and is very easy to use for all text input applications. The keyboard slides back into the phone very securely, unlike my Fuze that was constantly jiggling around.  The on-screen keyboard, although not really needed, works very well and is easy to use; I especially like the swype function that accurately determines the words you want to spell. The hardware buttons are useful and well located, and there are free apps available to custom program their function if desired.  The WiFi functions very fast, with easy web browsing, audio/video streaming, etc. all with very little lag. I thought I would attempt to max out the processor by running GPS, Web Browser, SNES Emulator, and Media Player simultaneously; and even with all of that the only lag I experienced was switching between the running apps.  The only cons I can say about this phone are that the accelerometer that detects portrait/landscape mode will sometimes lag for a few seconds before figuring out you have turned the phone (if keyboard isn't out, in which case it immediately switches to landscape mode, which is good), and the battery life could be a little longer.  However, I am so impressed with the phone that I have been using it extensively throughout the day, with wi-fi on, running various high-end apps, and one charge gets me about 3/4 through the day (7am to about 6pm) before needing to plug in.  If I were using it normally, which is for calls/texts here and there and occasionally using an app here and there, (as opposed to tinkering and experimenting with the phone all day) I am certain the battery would easily last through a full day.  Other than that, I have been so impressed with this little Android phone I truly hope to see more smartphones from Pantech in the future.  Even though the display is HVGA, the colors are vivid and graphics appear better than my Fuze, even though it was full VGA with a screen of the same size.  I would definitely recommend this to any tech geek such as myself who is on a budget, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pantech Crossover Prepaid Android GoPhone", "Author": "Marilyn Burns", "ReviewID": "R2USC2AAHSQJ6D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I waited for a while before choosing a phone and carrier.

(UPDATE Now working with Net10 perfectly) I have had plenty of time to fiddle with all the settings and because of WiFi I have been able to update all my apps and make the phone the way I like it.Also if you have not read any of the reviews and your used to the un-touched Android system you should know that AT&T; added and changed some of the things in the Pantech like the bottom four soft key buttons can't be changed (call,mess,net,etc).  I found a way around this using (Go Launcher Pro) from Google play.  It is a free desktop skin for Android and it overrides the AT&T; screen and has a bunch of great themes you can add to it, very sweet.  Also their call program is a bit different, but in the end I ended up liking it better than the original as it was easier to navigate and the colors are easy on the eyes. (UPDATE ON THE CALL PROGRAM) I found that I could not use the AT&T; contact list as it would just hang waiting to talk to AT&T; servers.  Since I was not going to use this phone with AT&T; I found another great freebee on Google play called \"EX DIALER\"  Not only did it by pass the AT&T; program so that I could use my contacts updated from my Google account, it also has some great skins to make it cool looking.It still takes me a little bit to get used to having the settings and home buttons as \"hard\" buttons instead of \"soft touch\" buttons but it's not that big of a deal.  I heard of some folks talk about the screen being hard to see or have a yellow tint but my phone shows none of those problems and the screen can be set to be very bright.  It does not have an auto brightness built in like my Droid.  I bought a nice rubberized case for it that fit it perfectly and ordered some screen covers to boot.The camera for me takes pretty good pictures even in lower light but one draw back it that it has about a 2 second delay from when you hit the camera button and when it clicks the pic.  You almost think it isn't going to take the picture so if your trying to get that quick before it's gone pic you might be disappointed, but I didn't need a super camera so it does just fine for me.The outside speaker on this phone is very quiet compared to my Droid.  I could hardly hear the ringer even if it was in my hand and I found myself wanting to keep turning it up.  So to fix this I found another app on Google play called (Funny SMS Ringtones) and it has some great \"LOUD & Funny\" sounds for notification and ringtones that are easy to hear.  I think that it's not so much the speakers fault but that the built in ringtones are just to quiet.  So now when my phone rings (testing it) it is very loud.  (UPDATE)  After using this phone in the real world with the new ringtones I have no problem hearing my phone even in it's case.Now the real reason I bought this phone over many others was because of the keyboard.  Most keyboards are too small for my big (meat cutter fingers) to use.  But Pantech decided to use four rows instead of 5 so that you can actually get your fingers on the darn buttons.  Some complain about that and others say it's great.  (UPDATE) I did notice that when using the screen keyboard that it does not have a T9 or any other suggestion program like my Droid had but since I use the keyboard most of the time anyway it does not matter to me except when I can't spell something right : ) Other than that it does what most Android smart phones do and I really like the phone and it's \"different\" design and should be happy with it for some time.So Now the ugly...  If you are thinking of buying this phone and using it with AT&T; just don't do it.  You will regret it and will be very upset for spending your hard earned dollars.  If you want a taste of how bad things are with AT&T; just Google ([...] ) and read all the reviews.I myself bought this phone to use with Net10 and I'm just waiting for the Sim card and Minutes to arrive in the mail.  But I was hoping to use the $25 air time to hold me until my stuff came from Net10.  Well After several frustrating talks with Amazon that kept trying to get me to the Amazon wireless (who by the way has nothing to do with prepaid phones) I finally got to talk to someone who took the time to forward me to AT&T; and wait on the line until I got to talk to a real human (Almost impossible to do with AT&T;).After talking to the AT&T; rep I found out that it could take up to 10 days to activate my phone.  I said WHAT???  Ten days, are you kidding me.  He said yes.  I told him that there isn't another phone company anywhere that would make me wait 10 days to turn on a phone.  He informed me that there was nothing he could do as it was already in the system. In the mean time my phone keeps getting texts (every day) from AT&T; telling me I need to give them more money.  And I asked him about that.  He said my information was in the system and it \"should\" activate.  But yet the stupid system keeps telling me to give more money (even today).  It does not say anything about my phone waiting to activate.  They have very deceptive practices and very lousy customer support from India.The other thing they don't tell you is that even if you buy a $50 \"unlimited\" card you still have to pay for a \"data\" plan for this phone.  The \"unlimited\" plan does not include your data (and you have to have a data plan for this phone).  So in the end you will end up paying the $50.00 and up to $15.00 for a data plan.  For a better price you can use this phone with a company like Straight Talk or Net10 for $50 bucks or under and it covers everything.  So save yourself the trouble and don't use AT&T.;  It has been over 6 days now (Update 9 days) and still I get the \"give us money texts\" and no service from them.  Even though they say everything is right and I did set it up correctly.  I did finally get Amazon to give my $25 bucks back and that helped with all the trouble.So in the end after spending months looking for a good smart phone from some of the pre-paid company's and being very disappointed with the quality as most were very cheap this phone feels great and the keyboard is supper easy to use and has a nice feel to it (Especially with the new Rubberized Case).  I would not have a problem paying the full price for it.  Though I just saw that it went up almost 40 bucks (UPDATE) Looks like they dropped it back down.  Still when looking for a great quality though not the fanciest smart phone this phone is very much worth the price.  Just don't think you will get that $25 bucks from AT&T; because you will be sadly mistaken.  I have talked to Amazon about this as I'm sure others have too but it seems that because it is sold with the credit it is not something they can change so make a informed decision and get a good phone and ignore the $25 dollar air time credit.UPDATE 9-10-12  Ok so after 9 days I still had no service from AT&T; and my Net10 sim and air time card finally arrived.  So I called up Net10 to make sure I did everything right.  Took about 5 minutes to ad my information and Activate the Sim.  Told me to turn off the phone and turn it back on.  So I did and like a normal phone service should act my phone was activated and running IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES.After that I had to update the Access Point Name on my Pantech to work with Net10 data servers (Internet and Email) and I was done.  They give you pretty easy instructions on the settings that need to be updated but I still had to go online to see where I could find these settings on my phone.For those of you that are not intimidated by this, this is how you do that.  On your home screen hit the settings button (left hard button) and touch the settings tab.  Then touch the (wireless & networks) button.  Then scroll down to the bottom and touch the (Mobile Networks) button.  The you will see the third listing down is (Access Point Names) so touch that button.  When you get to this point you will see the two AT&T; settings.  So now just click on the left hard button to bring up the settings and touch the (New APN) button.  From this point you will need the settings that come with your service provider.  Just fill in the ones it tells you and leave the others blank.  Make sure to take your time and get all the spelling right or you will have to do it again.  After that  just hit the back button and then you will see the new APN (Net10, Straight Talk).  Just touch the button next to the name to highlight it green and then click your home button and that's it.I do thank someone for telling me about going to Facebook to fix the AT&T; problem but if that is the way a company works where I can't talk to someone live on the phone and fix the problem then I do not want to do business with them.  I know for a fact that there is no way to prove who you are on Facebook and you could be talking to anybody in the world.  There are millions of fake Facebook accounts.  If you gave that person your information and then found out it was fake you would be in serious trouble.  It's just not the way to do business.One more thing that I thought I would mention is about the Google sign in when you first boot up the phone.  If you have ever had a android phone before and had a Google account then this is the account you want to use when it asks.  If you don't have one then you will at this point want to go online and make one as you will need it to get on the Google play for all your Apps.  Even if you have not activated the phone you want to enter this information the first time you turn on your phone because if you don't do it now there is a chance that it will never sync your accounts (Email and Personals like Phone #'s).  And then the only way to fix it is to factory reset the phone and start over.  Just ask me how I found this one out lol....So in the end what is my view on this phone?  I really like this phone and if it had been my first Android phone I probably wouldn't have known the difference.  I think in the end it would have been better for AT&T; to leave the phone alone and let the customer decide what programs they wanted or at least make it possible to remove them.  But thankfully by using a couple of add on's like Go launcher Pro, EX Dialer & Funny SMS Ringtones it made my phone work like a charm.  I also understand that this is not a high end phone but in the end it was WAY BETTER than the stock phones I saw in the stores for $100 bucks or more and I am very pleased with it.  So if your going to use AT&T; (not my suggestion) then you probably would be able to use this thing right out of the box (once they finally get your phone turned on).  But if your going to use it with another company then I would download the few add on's and make sure your Google account is entered as soon as you first turn on your phone and you should be pretty happy with it.  I know I am so thanks for taking the time to read my very long review and good luck : )UPDATE 9-9-13:  Well if you made it this far on my super long review then you will be super glad to know that after a year I have had not one problem with this phone.  It's still going strong with no key problems or any other problems.  Really this is one of the best phones I have ever had.  Now I have a friend that uses Verizon and has gone through more phones than I have underwear (no kidding).  Every time he tells me he had to get another phone because of this or that I just laugh and shake my head and thank God that after a year I am still going strong with this little phone.  The only thing I have had to buy is another case as I finally dropped the phone and it broke.

I used their website and had no issues getting assigned a local phone number, etc.I didn't want to pay for a data plan, and you don't have to with this phone, as long as you only use the data features when you are in the range of a wifi network.

Whether you get the credit or not depends largely on who you happen to get on the phone when you call 611. The young man who I spoke to, who could barely string a sentence together, was clueless as to the credit and said the IMEA number from the phone showed no credit. But I explained to him the box clearly showed it did come with a credit he eventually managed to add the $25 to my account an it showed up immediately. I then had to walk him through changing the expiration from 30 days to 90 days as indicated. But he did manage to change this as well and I got everything I requested.

It is easy to use, has great features, and I get constant comments from people as to its appearance.  With the slide-out keyboard, it is incredibly easy to type messages whether for texting or when connected to the internet.  It gets great reception in places my old phone could not get any.As with other purchasers, I will say that the battery life is less than with non-Android phones.  It does, however, seem to be on par or even slightly better than other Androids.  I charge my Pantech Crossover every other day.  This is with very little talk time, 20 to 30 text messages a day, and approximately 2 to 3 hours on the internet every day.  I find an every other day charge to be perfectly reasonable given these conditions.  It also charges quickly and the charging cord comes with interchangeable heads for a wall outlet, car charger, and computer USB port.My only complaint here is with Amazon.  This advertisement clearly states that the phone comes with a $25 airtime credit.  Naturally, this credit was never received.  When I contacted AT&T;, they said that the credit was a promotion that accompanied these phones several months ago.  The promotion expired, but Amazon continued to advertise the $25 credit.  AT&T; will not provide the credit and stated that it is up to Amazon to provide a credit since they continue to advertise it.  When I contacted Amazon, I was told to contact AT&T.;  After explaining the situation, the contact at Amazon simply told me to call someone else and would not provide a $25 credit.  This, quite frankly, infuriates me.  I have turned more than 100 people into Amazon enthusiasts by bringing them to the site and showing them how great it is.  I personally spend more than a thousand dollars here every single year on products and gift cards.  Now, it seems that Amazon is willing to lose me as a customer over a lousy $25 credit.  Buyer beware!!!  This phone is excellent, but buy it elsewhere.  When Amazon is no longer willing to stand behind its own advertised products, it is time to move on.  You can get this phone at the exact same price at the AT&T; website.

Smartphones with physical keyboards AND good ratings are somewhat difficult to find. Pantech was one of the better rated ones, so I went with it.It took him a day or two to adjust and then he realized how much he could customize on his phone and he's liked it ever since. He forgets to turn off his wifi (he doesn't use data so it's never on), so he tends to go through his battery pretty quickly. I'd say he charges it every other day, depending on how much he's actually using the phone. He really likes the speaker function too. I ask him every now and then if he likes it, and he always says \"yes\".One strange problem is that it occasionally stops working (like it won't acknowledge touch commands), and has to be restarted. This might be because I upgraded the OS and not be the fault of the phone at all. I'm not sure. Either way, simply restarted the phone fixes the problem.

After a few days when you call to discover they have not credited your account you will try to contact customer service to find out why. When you contact customer service it's automated and the robot does not understand anything you say. Be prepared to get angry and want to break things. The best part about AT&T; is after being put on hold and going through their million menus just to talk to a Rep, when they connect you, you will get a message that says your call cannot be completed, please try again. Oh yes, at that point the phone just about went through a window. I got the message at least 3 times. For the record, they disabled the \"press 0 to talk to a real person\" feature. Finally, I get to talk to somebody after numerous attempts. This time while I'm on the phone the guy wants the code that is under the battery. Um ok?

He tried talking me into it and I explained to him this phone is a birthday gift for a 9 year old and phone calls and texts are for emergencies only. He asked me what time it was, and I told him. He said he would call me back by 2 pm with the credit information. By 2:30, I did not hear from him and was getting ready for my daughters birthday party.

My family wanted to keep our numbers so I thought it would make more sense to contact AT&T; before activating the phone so the process could be done at the same time. WRONG! Activate the phone first and get a new number. Then call AT&T.; Otherwise you just keep getting transferred.The first 3 of my phones I activated, AT&T; wouldn't activate the credit without my purchasing more airtime. I did not purchase any data plans as I read in another review.I activated our 4th phone about a week later because it had been \"misdelivered\". So I activated the phone first and was assigned a new number, then AT&T; activated the credit right away with no additional airtime purchases.My review so far has been about my difficulties with AT&T;, but my only disappointment with Amazon is the description of the rollover minutes. AT&T; does not rollover the minutes on the $25 plan. Very disappointing! And mobile to mobile does not apply to that plan either. We've been burnung through minutes because we thought we weren't consuming minutes when we, in fact, were and we thought we'd be able to slowly build up our minutes over time, but we can't.Rollover only applies to the $10 and $15 plans.This is a very nice phone for someone who doesn't use their phone to talk a lot, if sticking with the $25 plan. My kids love it. They use the wi-fi all the time and they never talk, mostly text. They would love it more if I'd purchase a data plan. And it will be nice for travel.

I don't want to deter anyone from buying this phone, as I have no real complaints with it, but I do have major issues with the customer service from AT&T; in regards to their GoPhone plan.First off, the instructions inside this box says the $25 credit will be applied within an hour after activating the phone.  We waited several hours, with no credit. We called AT&T; to port our number from a US Cellular number, but they kept telling us we needed to have airtime credit in order to do that.  We'd tell them we're supposed to have a credit, they'd tell us it should be there within 10 minutes. And put this cycle on repeat and you get a great idea of how things went for the next couple of days. They insisted we had activated the SIM card on a Samsung phone, although we had installed the SIM card that came in the box into our Pantech phone. They were very confused and kept telling us we had used a Samsung phone, basically calling us liars, when CLEARLY we did not, we don't even own a Samsung phone. They begrudgingly ported my number, but no airtime credit. So I was unable to use the phone for several days while I battled with them over the free credit. It never arrived. I finally broke down and added $10 to my account just so people could get ahold of me if needed.  We called about 5-6 times inquiring about the credit, always being told they were doing it now and please wait 10 minutes.  The last time we called they said it could be a week. We waited the week.....no credit.  Called again. No credit.  This has gone on for several weeks and I feel the credit will never come.  I've contacted Amazon as they advertise this as coming with the credit and awaiting response, will update when I have a resolution.Overall, phone is great --- but don't count on the credit.*****UPDATE*****  Amazon issued me a $25 promotional credit, so all's well that end's well.

However I do consider myself above average in tech savvy, I just hadn't felt the need to have a high tech phone.  I did have a Samsung Propel for several years, that allowed me to check my email on the go and some simple web browsing, plus I could use it as a bluetooth jump point to use my laptop in the car.  I had been pondering an Iphone vs android for several months, and had about decided to go Windows platform with the Nokia Lumia, but my current carrier has not yet been authorized for the technology by AT&T.;  OK all the history out of the way, I saw this great deal on a Lightning daily deal, saw from the reviews that even though it was sold as a Go Phone, that it could be used with an existing AT&T; plan with Data.  I also noticed used ones on Ebay were selling for more than what I paid, so hey, a no brainer, don't like it, sell it on ebay and get your money back.  One of my reasons for hesitating to make the jump so long, was many of my friends on Android, had tons of problems, freezing up, slow response time etc.  Well my experience has been fantastic, very responsive, no freezes, fast scrolling etc.  Also and maybe this is part of my inexperience, the option to have the slide out qwerty keyboard, is an amazing plus.  It makes it sooo much easier for typing out long messages, or using a message board online.  Also I LOVE the wifi aspect, as I have been working in a department located in the basement of the building, so no signal, but we have company provided WIFI, which allows me to jump onto to Crossover and check messages, browse sites on lunch that the company filters out(Ebay, Craig's List etc).  Also call quality has been excellent, as has the 20 or so pictures I have taken, when transferred to my laptop they look really good.  I like the size and even though I do have to scroll sideways to see part of certain websites, I think it's a pretty good tradeoff for the size.

With that on GO phone, you get 12 days of unlimited service ($2/day) but it expires in 30 days - more than enough for vacation.* - Amazon Customer service emails me 4 days later states that one phone gets a $25 credit, the other does not b/c I didn't use the included SIM card. Two problems here...1) the phone that gets the $25 credit - the credit expires the same time as the money I already paid - so it's worthless. 2) the second phone was activated with the included SIM card and Amazon/AT&T; is confused.* - Contact Amazon customer Service one more time, two weeks later after vacation. Now told need to contact amazon wireless directly.Bottom line - I'm out $50. My experience with AT&T; customer service - absolutely unacceptable worst in class. My experience with Amazon customer service on this purchase - not much better.(Update: Amazon Wireless team is helping). I've spend literally $1000's of dollars with Amazon over the years and this is the first time I've ever been ripped off. I'm around 4 hrs with various customer service people trying to get this resolved and I'm not giving up yet, but right now, my recommendation would be to purchase wireless phones from some other retailer if promotions are involved and matter to you.Update:**  - Contacted Amazon Wireless...told them my sad saga.  They were pretty embarrassed.  Gave me a $30 credit and now are trying to work with AT&T; to get me the $25 credits from AT&T.;  Still not resolved, but at least they are now trying to make things right.Update 2:* 1/2 - Received $30 credit from Amazon, was told they would work with AT&T; to resolve the issue and call me back.  Received a call two days later stating they had not resolved the issue but would work it and call me back with resolution.  Now three months later.  No call back, no lovin'.Bottom line.

My answer to this is yes, I used the wifi on the phone- apps included, without even inserting the SIM card.About a week after getting this phone I found my toddler had kindly dunked the phone in water for me. I grabbed it out quickly, stuck it in a box of rice and after the next day it worked perfectly fine again. This is great because while that might work on the iPhone it doesn't always work for other androids.Using TextPlus (which is about a dollar for 40 minutes) I have FREE texting as long as there is wifi, and I also can make free calls in the USA. I use text plus because the service is much cheaper than the 20 cents a minute plan I chose. I'm alright with choosing that plan because I rarely use my phone when I go out. I use Nimbuzz which allows free calling through Gtalk, which comes in much clearer than skype.So after this, and considering my \"plan\" is only for emergencies.. my phone bill makes it about 8 dollars a month.My uncle paid at least 500 dollars for his phone and mine does the same exact things, besides the camera in the front.MY ONLY COMPLAINTS...The camera is on the back of the phone. Which to me is a little senseless, especially if you intend to use this phone for the webcam. You can use the camera as a webcam of course provided that you are perfectly fine with talking in the mirror.The back of the phone for the battery is a little flimsy. Definitely order a cover.Update: Two years later...I still have this phone. The phone has been dropped numerous times and it still works. The dog chewed the back of the phone when it fell off. (The back piece sucks. You'll need a case.) That was last year, and the phone works. I have had to do a factory restore numerous times because I have failed to replace the memory card.

P. Keber", "ReviewID": "R27U73SILJUZD1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: affordable; great intro to Android (Gingerbread, no higher); pretty sturdy with a case; slide-out keyboard; tough glass screen; takes surprisingly good pictures and videos (NOT HD); nice rounded corner design; good voice quality on calls; so-so music playing qualityCons: Weak processor; slow processor; minuscule internal storage capacity; minuscule RAM; slow access to storage card; spontaneous reboots (especially when running processor-intensive tasks like workout-fitness programs); tiny screen; incompatible with many modern Android apps; short battery life when running all the stuff (Wifi, GPS, apps, etc.); videos barely tolerableDid I mention how slow and weak the processor is and how it reboots spontaneously?Okay, so I got this about 11 months ago as of this writing. My first smartphone. Even then the screen looked small, but that was easy to forgive because, you know: *smartphone*! I set about learning all the things it could do, transferring all my contacts\u2014 manually\u2014 from my feature phone. I looked into anti-virus and other geeky stuff like file management apps. I got a 32 GB micro SD card, took pictures and videos and generally used it a lot. I totally quit using the slide out keyboard when I downloaded and then bought SwiftKey because it anticipates my typing needs so uncannily well (I'll plug SwiftKey here because it really is almost spooky how well it knows *exactly* what I want to say when I'm typing. I almost prefer it to typing on my terrific Logitech K750 keyboard. I'm just a SwiftKey customer, no other connection).One of the things I was most excited about was apps that could record my walks using the phone's GPS receiver. You plug in your personal info (age, weight, etc) and go work out. It maps out your route, including elevation changes. It figures distance covered, pace, mph/kph, calories burned and a lot more. It's terrific for cardiac cases.BUT it is a processor-intensive app. From the very first fitness app I tried\u2014 and I've tried several\u2014 the phone would run it for a while and then spontaneously reboot itself, right in the middle of a hike/walk/run/bicycle ride. All the data would be lost. The rebooting problem has only worsened over time. Now sometimes it reboots while just the music player is running. No, I haven't contacted Pantech about it, as the phone only cost me forty bucks and I plan to buy a Samsung Galaxy SII from either Virgin or T-Mobile.Oh, and the MASSIVE Android malware security hole that was recently made public? Pantech has not only not yet released a fix for this phone (as of this writing), but when it does YOU have to go to the Pantech site and download and install it yourself. You will need a Windows PC to do that, Macs need not apply unless you know how. Pantech won't push it out to your phone, I'm not sure they are even capable of doing that. If you do any banking or credit transactions with your phone, only buy one whose manufacturer has fixed that.That's the other thing I should mention: AT&T;'s GoPhone plans work pretty well for talk and text. I have been using the $2/day plan which only costs me if I use the phone, and I tried to use to phone ONLY to make VoIP calls over wifi networks. Doing that religiously is a great way to contain costs, but it really negates the whole point of having a phone for data connections: if I only connect to the 'net when I'm in wifi range, I might as well just use my laptop. Working this way essentially reduces my phone to an Android iPod Touch.So here's the scoop: it you want to use this AT&T; phone for data connections, expect to pay in the area of fifty to eighty-five bucks per month, according to the nice people at the AT&T; store. And it will be a 3G connection at best, which is fairly slow.Upshot is, I'm looking at a new phone and a new carrier. My technophobe wife will probably inherit this P8000 Crossover. It's a great starter unit (well, ignoring the possible security issues) for learning how to work with smartphones, but it will leave you wanting something better. That's the bad news.

I've been very happy with it, but it depends on what you need.SCREENFor a phone in this price range, the screen is surprisingly vibrant, and the colors aren't bad.  The resolution is low, so it can't compare to a high end phone.  Functionally, this can make reading tiny website text a headache.  For apps, I haven't had any problems.The touch sensitivity is pretty good, and it is easy to do gestures like pinching to zoom.  Typing works as well as it can on a small screen.BUILDThis is a chunky phone.  That is partly do to it being outdated and partly due to the keyboard.  The keyboard is handy when I want to write a relatively long text, email, or Amazon review.  The numbers require using the function key.  This is a matter of preference, but I like separate numbers.I have yet to have any issues with the phone breaking or chipping.  That is one advantage of plastic over glass.SOFTWAREAn easy software upgrade from Pantech moves the phone to Gingerbread.  That means that it is compatible with most modern apps.  I also downloaded the FTL loader to speed things up a bit.  Everything works nicely and moving between screens is snappy.  The unlock tab is a bit laggy for some reason, but it's not a big issue.This is definitely a smartphone, despite being so old.  I can run most apps, such as fitness stuff or Youtube, just fine.  Because of the low speed and memory of the phone (add a micro SD card to boost the memory), only basic games will function without slowdown and some of the fancier apps with sophisticated graphics do not work or are slow.This is android, so gmail and calendar integration are excellent.  I also use google voice and it works well.BATTERYI have never had an issue with the battery running down, unless I forgot to charge it overnight.  When I play games and watch Youtube for a few hours to kill time somewhere, it kills a lot of the battery life, but there is still plenty to last the rest of the day.CAMERAThe camera works okay for both stills and video with good lighting.  It is good enough to do the job, but will not trick anyone into thinking that you have an iPhone.  Still, unlike the throwaway cameras on feature phones, it is actually good enough for decent spur-of-the-moment photos.OVERALLThe Pantech Crossover is a surprisingly capable phone for the super low price.

She kept baiting me so I put there own rep on the phone and he got into it with her until she put the manager on.  He made them set it up right then and there.  A little extreme to get what I paid for but I did get it and since I needed to go in to get my sim cards sinced it was ok.

In that time, I've certainly come to know the phone's strengths and weaknesses. While I originally wasn't going to post a review (I believe AT&T; has discontinued the phone, so I doubt it's even on anybody's radar right now), recent events have made me change my mind.Almost immediately after getting my phone, I attempted to upgrade the OS to Gingerbread via the Pantech Upgrade tool available on their website. Anyway, every time I connected my phone to my computer via the USB cable provided with the phone, Windows simply told me that the device had malfunctioned and would not work properly. At this point, I just assumed my computer was too old. I'm still using XP, I don't even have 1GB of RAM, etc. More on this later, however.So, I ignored the update and just used the phone as it was. Over the months the phone began to show some of the more annoying symptoms of a failing device. It would randomly turn off or reboot, occasionally lock up, become very slow, etc.Just recently, I finally decided that I'd had enough. While I was digging around online for a new phone, I decided to charge my Crossover. Since all I had available to me was a friend's USB cable, I connected the phone to his PC. Much to my surprise, the computer identified the phone. So, I borrowed my friend's USB cable and connected my Crossover to my own PC. Sure enough, Windows ID'd it no problem. I then tried the USB cable that came with the Crossover and, as expected, Windows failed to ID the device every time. The provided cable works great when it comes to charging the phone, it just can't be used for a phone<->PC connection, apparently. I guess I got a lemon?So, after bricking my phone with a failed update attempt, (i.e. the upgrade tool actually told me that the update had failed and that I needed to disconnect my Crossover, put it in download mode, and reconnect it) I FINALLY got my Crossover updated to Gingerbread. Months later, I would like to add...Now, while Gingerbread is a breath of fresh air (to me), my phone is plagued by new problems. The biggest of which being that my Settings menu randomly \"stops working\" when I attempt to open it. The phone just instructs me to \"try again,\" but it's always the same. When this happens, a reboot is required in order for me to access my Settings.I would replace the phone, but I just looked at all of AT&T;'s prepaid phones and they're all junk. The Fusion II looks interesting, but it's hard to find any reviews for it.

I received the phone on 30-Oct-12. The Pantech Crossover doesn't seem too heavy or too awkward to handle, and the screen seems large enough for me. The price of this type of phone is too good to pass up. This phone has more features than I believe that I'll ever use, but times do change and I may find myself using these features as I move along. There certainly is a lot to learn.About the $25 free air time that's supposed to come with the phone: I had to work at it to receive it; and you also will have to work for it.The instructions for the phone say that I would receive the air time credit in approximately one hour after phone activation (this is a brand new account and I am using the SIM card that came with the phone), but the credit didn't register on my account. I gave AT&T; 24 hours and then I visited AT&T;'s wireless support web page and got a phone number to call; I used a land line (I didn't put the phone numbers here because that may violate Amazon's rules). After I made contact with a living person and stated my problem,  I was immediately transferred to another department. I verified every thing about the phone with the AT&T; representative and I was told that I would be receiving the credit in a little while. Well, I gave them another 24 hours and I still didn't get the air time. In the mean time, I did purchase a prepaid GoPhone card and applied the money to my account. I then called AT&T; again, went through the same automated answering stuff until I got to a representative, and received my credit.Tips: Be sure to write down the phone's IMEI number from the inside of the phone before you put the battery in; have your new phone number written down in front of you and the pass code for your account when you call support; when you call for support and you get an automated answering system asking you to \"SAY\" what you want, say out loud \"Talk to someone.\" The air time credit is only for new accounts. I believe that this particular GoPhone was sold at a much higher price with the air time and now AT&T; will give you a little bit of a run around to get the air time credit.

Any Class Action Lawyers out there? The class looks to be very big.My recommendation is to avoid all ATT products and services as they will only lead to grief.

I stopped using VirginMobile because I can't hear voicemails and was using it for texting to two people one stopped.  So right now I can only \"call\" out using IP Relay on a PC someplace, at home, Starbucks, library, etc. but I cannot receive incoming calls because I've got no \"personal device.\" BTW, cops do not either, so they also cannot receive incoming \"deaf\" service calls by either TRS, IP Relay or VRS! Not only that, they don't think getting a mobile relay device is a priority...! So since I never ask anyone to do something that I know is not reasonable for me to do, I am trying to find a device that works and that is relatively cheap and easy.  If I cannot use it, it's not going to work for a busy cop, ENT, fire, CSW, etc.  This is also a huge problem if my residential wifi goes down I literally cannot \"call\" for a tech person, they cannot call me back and the \"chat\" does not work, comcast hangs up on IP Relay or puts it on hold for hours (I timed it for 3 hours and finally disconnected my end).So, before you go rolling your eyes at another AbbyJo adventure with telecom, let me tell you, that I DID GET IT TO POWER ON AND PLAYED W/IT I TRIED!!!!  Just as I did try with the Corso press and the iPod Touch.  (I replaced Corso press with Wells press then with Breville, and am still juicing and losing weight, now down 18#). iPod Touch was sleek and pretty, could put it in art museum but had no contrast and if you see my product review, despite Apple's normally wonderful customer service, they could not help one deaf lady get it turned ON without telling me to go to a NOISY STORE.  (I am HYPERACUTE, I use only deaf telecom and related apps).  But I digress.I bought this so that I would know when someone is CALLING ME and have some way to tell them they have reached a person who uses only written language and/or IP Relay, which does allow me to call \"hearing\" people.  The bottom line is all the cell phone companies have lots of devices for hearing people but not many for people that need sign language or TEXT ONLY by live relay, which is a FREE service.  So we need devices that are mobile some for old fogies that have questionable eyesight and need contrast and big screens and big keys, but with cheapo data-only or wifi-only plans.  I am not seeing that on the market yet, close but not there yet...just as closed captions still aren't on the instant downloads...I am still asked to rewind, read lips, get the script...but I digress again.So I called customer service for AT&T;, they declined to try to help at all, referring me to PANTECH.  PANTECH said it's a \"third party app\" meaning the IP Relay plug in is a third party app.  i pointed out that without this type of app the device is worthless they said too bad, hung up.  I called PANTECH back, they then tried to help me connect device to wifi, device would not connect but settings were correct.  wifi is always on at home.  i do not remember putting in any password.  in any event, without wifi working on device, cannot use the app. I am not sure if amazon allows urls, but it's here, free for all deaf:[...] It shows I can use one of three or four devices, so far two have failed to work for this purpose and zero customer support for it.I did see a cool AT&T; scanner app that seemed to work for scanning the app from a symbol on a web page using the camera and the app, but could not see the app appear on the screen or try it without wifi working on the device.  If amazon editors did not erase the url (public service url, editors!) then you will see there is supposed to be a quick easy way to get the app off the web page and into the phone.  this same app would be cool to use in retail stores to see prices, get product info from similar coded labels, etc.  maybe there is a bar code app too.  but first i need to get THIS deaf telecom (IP RELAY) app on the device, or i don't have a working device!  Hello?This particular product is very small and hard to see anything without magnifying glass for me personally.  It is just the right size to lose in a pocket and leave in the washing machine.  I did NOT do that but would not trust myself to see black on black in a pocket.This is second rejected mobile device i have tried in 2 months for receiving IP Relay which i still cannot receive, I cannot get a message from anybody, but for six years until March 2012 I could without a device...the provider lost its FCC license!Can anybody reading this come up with a large screen QWERTY keyboard device for DEAF THAT DO NOT SIGN, DO NOT USE VRS but still need the mobile wifi and camera features for other reasons? instant video would be useful too, for when i cannot communicate but would like a small momento of dramas created by others before i depart.  I will read all respectful responses!i may try the blackberry next or a tablet of some sort that has wireless, but the app is designed as a plug in for blackberry, android and iPad/iPhone only, as far as i know, so not sure it will work on tablet but it should work on any computer (tablet being a hard drive, screen and Intel chip without a CD drive, what my son uses for school...)  ---", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "cant get apples app store on this", "Author": "Brian McGrath the Carny", "ReviewID": "R2BY25A06RC4KU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Greetings fellow amazonians I wanted to update my phone, but since I travel so much with my canival I felt the pay as you go model would be better than my current iphone on att.
