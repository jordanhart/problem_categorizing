{"Reviews": [{"Title": "MotoMing beats the iPhone, Blackberry, and all others -- hands down", "Author": "Lily Mazahery", "ReviewID": "RHCGF7S7CYHUY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my first Ming about 3 years ago and when I lost the first one, I went straight to the AT&T; store and purchased an iPhone.  Compared to my Ming, the iPhone was an iJoke!  So I returned it, paid the $40 restocking fee, and ordered another Ming immediately.  Recently, I upgraded to the Ming A1600, and I absolutely love it.  For someone who uses her phone as much as I do for both business and personal purposes, this phone is ideal.The only problem so far is that I have not been able to find a site to download an English version of the GPS map system, so my GPS is in Chinese!  However, because I love this phone so much, I might have to learn Chinese just for the GPS system if I can't find the English map.In sum, Motorola Ming A1600 is a FANTASTIC product with a multitude of amazing features and applications that are suitable for both business and personal uses.  I highly recommended it.", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Doesn't deliver expected performance", "Author": "LindaT", "ReviewID": "R1XEBVBUAEFDR2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I own the first generation Ming and love itI bought this Ming as a replacement for my first generation Ming.It blacks out on occasion when I need to use it.In addition, the body is not as charming as the first generation Ming. It's rather plain and bulky.I've also owned other smart phones like the iphone. I do not like the iphone and when I saw a review that raved about how they thought the iphone is a joke compared to the capabilities of this Ming I was sold on the idea of trying it out. That is because I too am not impressed with the iphone. However, I'd have to say as unimpressed as I am with my iphone, I like it better than this Ming version.The apps on this Ming version is not appealing, The speaker quality is poor, although it is loud.Don't find out for yourself if this Ming works for you its a waste of 2 big ones. I would not recommend it to any of my friends or relatives.Hope that Motorola will redesign the next generation Ming to be a ridiculously awesome professional side-kick. I do like the Ming line, just not this one. Hope that Motorola will polish up on the performance, deliver functionality + beauty. Also, bring the Ming line to the US...make some US versions there's a market for them in the US you know.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "A 1600", "Author": "Cerato12", "ReviewID": "RZWB3GPENRBW0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very best product, Motorola is a excellent manufacturer and obvious your products.
