Some people don't NEED that. I love the text messaging capabilities, the battery life, and its overall ability to withstand all the nonsense I've put it through. It's chipped all around the edges, missing the back cover (yeah I taped the battery in ;) ), etc. It still works like a champion! Because of this phone, I'll hopefully be upgrading to the Captivate here in a few weeks. This phone really helped solidify some trust in Samsung products.

When i was cell hunting this year 2011 for my next phone i looked at the eternity 2 and found out this one was way better in ratings among both eternity's. From my experience this is a great phone that offers 3G that should be at maximum about 3.6 mbps. This phone is so close to the iphone in its features and i would recommend this phone to people who want an iphone like phone. This phone also plays your mp3's and even youtube videos*.*When converted it can play but you may need to convert in most cases.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the last few years", "Author": "Practical and Quality \"Jean\"", "ReviewID": "R3LYZKSAWRTWHT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for almost two years now and still love it.

Then i thought it was time for an upgrade, so i got a htc inspire. had that for about a month then it went through the washer and died, still had almost two years till i was due for an upgrade so i pulled out my old eternity. i put my sim card in and it worked. Iv been using it for almost four years now and the only thing is sometimes the touch screen is off by a bit or for example i typed an A then when i presed the space button it put another A. But thats not a problem. So far this phone has gone through alot and still works great. One more thing that is amazingly, as it has gotton older the battery has lasted longer, no mater how much i use it it still can go a few DAYS without loseing ONE bar of battery. My best phone EVER, even when i upgrade still going to keep it just in case :)", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wouldn't buy it again.", "Author": "Valerie Rawlings", "ReviewID": "R19J8EU9NK9P8Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone when I switched from Sprint to AT&T; 2 yrs ago.  I use it for calls, texting, pics, & video.  I don't use it for the internet.  My last phone was a flip phone.  I have to say I preferred my flip.  I don't like to have it beep over and over reminding me that I have a message since I work in an office environment, so I turned off that feature.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have any other means of indicating that you have a message when the display goes black.  My flip phone had a light on it that would stay on to let me know by looking at it, that is the biggest thing I miss.  The speaker on it is terrible.  I end up trying to push the phone into my ear just to hear the caller talking.  I don't know how clear I am to the caller.  Sometimes when I turn it off, it won't turn back on....and sometimes I can't get it to turn off.  It's like a stubborn computer that freezes up and then all of a sudden starts working again.  Reception on this phone is pretty bad and I can't tell if it's an AT&T; service problem or a problem with the phone.  Also, sometimes it doesn't let me know I have messages (voice or text) for days.  It's not very user friendly either so the bells and whistles are waisted on me since they are too complicated.  Nope, I wouldn't buy this phone again if I had it to do over.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "A cellphone should not be this frustrating", "Author": "bbrain \"bookie\"", "ReviewID": "R2P6IPQACO7OEL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Man was i disappointed with this phone, first of all the screen goes blank, the menus dont respond to touch or it responds to something not pressed, you have got to restart many times, also to restart you have to take the battery out.Finally the knobs at the bottom feels a bit cheap and when a call is coming through and you press to receive nothing happens........... yes you've got it , you have to take out the battery again and rebooth.Anyone wants a free cellphone?", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "I loved this phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"ME :)\"", "ReviewID": "R27933V2CFAR6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this phone for 2.5 years and I loved it.

All the features are almost countless and I am sure I am using only a fraction that's available as a standard on this phone. I originally paid $360 for an unlocked one back in 2008, and my main reason for choosing Eternity was that it was #1 rated for lowest radiation of all phones available at that time on the US market. That is very important to me. I do not regret paying that much whatsoever. The battery life is outstanding, and I love its music player - everything this phone offers is perfect! Love it.

Wolf \"Alyn\"", "ReviewID": "R1C64R64TLZYP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The wife and I obtained two of these babies brand new on an AT@T contract over 5 years ago. They have been one of the better investments we have ever made. Mine is still rock solid. Hers finally died; probably from old age and constant use. We have tried other phones before and since with none of them comparing to the Eternity. Keep in mind that we have no desire for smartphone technology or use. This is probably one of the better basic cell phones out there. It is the right size, wonderful touch screen, great ergonomics, with wonderful clarity coming and going. The 3 meg camera produces astonishingly good photos. I can only attribute that to what must be an above average lens. Everything works correctly for our purposes. I really like the way I get the large QWERTY virtual keyboard when I turn the phone horizontally for texting. I do find it somewhat difficult to text on any touch screen, but find that this one works better than most. It has that slight vibration feedback on every key stroke. It fits quite well in a belt case. About the only negative I have is that the speaker phone can produce some distortion especially if the volume is turned up too loud. Every time we think about upgrading to smartphones we decline because of the overpriced data charges, larger size, and complexity. Besides, we would rather use a second device with a larger screen such as our Samsung tablets for wi-fi internet away from home. We are even thinking about purchasing two more Eternities used or refurbished to hold in reserve.
