{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good choice", "Author": "W. Oliveira", "ReviewID": "R1J5I01GO9P3JV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first smartphone, and I admit I was having mixed feelings after my bad experience with my \"old\" Nokia N82. However I was positively surprised by some aspects of the device, specially the responsiveness and the usability. It is really easy to use, I gave it to my mom (she's 60 and always has problems to use tech stuff) and she just started to use it! Now after 2 weeks I think I have some contribution...What I liked:The touchscreen works very well, with some inaccuracy, only perceived in rare occasions when I need to click a link without zooming in the screenThe speed: usually it is very fast to switch from an app to another.Live Wallpaper: very impressive (although I suspect it eats the battery).\"Modem\" feature: in 30 seconds my laptop was connected to the Internet using the phone's 3G network, and without any cable!Camera: comes with all those candies the modern cameras have. I liked the Panorama.Display: amazing colors and cristal clear, can be used even at direct sunlight.Unlock Pattern: Sounds like a silly thing, but I liked it!Power profile: it shows how much of the battery is being consumed and by application, and then you may have a chance to improve battery life. In my case the display is by far the most battery eater, so there's not too much I can do, except do not use it.What workedWeb browser. It was able to render every page I've visited, it is fast and easy to use.Multi screen. It is nice to have more than one screen. I know it should be very useful, I just don't know for what.Swype: surprisingly easy to use, just needs some improvement on word prediction.Maps and traffic information.What could be improvedSoftware shop definitely needs to be improved, for example: I want the possibility to sort out search results, I want more filter options, and, of course, more software available. Also, some kind of security review/karma would be useful. Some form of accreditation of the suppliers also could help. I'm not saying I want the Apple dictatorial system, but I think some basic security indication/checking/verification would be good.Wifi: It works OK most of the time, but sometimes it does not connect automatically and then I have to go to the list of networks and click on the \"Connect\" button.3G: it took me some time to understand how to configure the network.  I still not 100% sure I could do it again if I lost the configuration...Applications:  too many applications, poorly organized. I'd like to have a way to group them in a logical way or inside a folder, specially those rarely used (may be there is a way and I just need to learn how to use it).Language: The default language is Korean or Chinese (I'm ignorant and I don't know the difference between the ideograms).  It should come in English!Language Support: definitely need to have Portuguese support.Speech recognition (Vlingo): That's a bad joke. I say SECTOR, it understands SEX STORE. Hmmm, is it reading my mind? :)Battery Life: It lasts for one day, in a good day. Much less if you are a heavy user.Access device's storage: That's tricky!  I spent a whole day trying to find a way to use the device's media on Linux... And then I found the problem: the SD card need to be unmounted first! (settings/SD card/Unmount SD card). Once I did that it worked.GPS: The initial lock takes much longer than Nokia N82.3G usage: I don't know how much data is being transmitted/received, let's see the next phone bill. That \"background transfer\" \"feature\" is my concern. Also, it could have some sort of carrier/network type selection, it is always using the network even when the only network available is Edge. OK, maybe it already has this control and I just don't know where it is.Lateral buttons: I'm always mistakenly pressing the buttons.Glitches: It hanged a couple of times. One of the times I had to remove the battery to get it back.

Dimacali \"waka-laka\"", "ReviewID": "R3CXXZYMT7F9WV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is simply one of the best looking phones out there and also one of the powerful ones.this phone truly shine in the graphics department. i myself don't expect a lot from mobile games but saying \"amazing\" when playing games like need for speed shift, nova, backbreaker, etc. is an understatement.it takes 720p video and high res images up to 2560x1920. the camera has plenty of functions which you can find similar to a digital camera, like smile shutter, panoramic, burst shot, cartoon effects, action shot and more. self portrait shots are taken with the front facing camera.using this phone in a 3G network (for me, it's AT&T;), is really satisfying. accessing full websites with the browser is like using a tablet computer. pinch-to-zoom and scrolling through websites is really smooth. downloading files works well too.the UI of the phone is great. some people don't like the TouchWiz UI, but at the same time, i don't really like the stock android skin. apps such as launcher pro plus and adw launcher can add customization for the UI. so you're not limited on how the menus look.widgets are another features that i do like and this phone runs them smoothly. live wallpapers is also supported.this device support a great amount of video and image files. i tested it by putting a 720p .H264 DivX video and played smoothly with no lags. i did some scrolling through the video and yet there is still no lag considering it's an hd movie that's playing.messaging is in thread form. supports mms for sending images, audio, video. the I9000-GT also supports video calling built in using the front camera. AT&T; doesn't support that but i tried it with an app called fring and it works over wifi or 3G.calendar sync for google calendar is also supported. it also includes ThinkFree Office which lets you edit/create/view Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Adobe PDF files.the Super AMOLED screen is really great! i love to be able to view what's on my phone when i'm outside or under the sun, if you're worried about that then worry no more!it annoys me sometimes how the screen is ridiculously bright in the dark even at the lowest settings. but that's a great thing! haha!watching movies on this 4 inch screen is great although the battery won't last very long if used that way.call quality is pretty good. no dropped calls nor signal lost so far.overall, i'm completely satisfied with this phone! i'm a phone addict and when i got this amazing device, i just stopped looking for other phones.all the features that i need and want are all in the Galaxy S and apps from the Android marketplace makes this phone worth more.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "No para latinoam\u00e9rica", "Author": "Jorge Aguilar", "ReviewID": "R1XPRNTT3I6OA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "El tel\u00e9fono es muy bueno, pero muchas redes de latinoam\u00e9rica no trabajan con la banda 850 en 3G, solo en 2G, lo que hace que el acceso a datos sea lento.

Huge beautiful screen and my first Android phone. I loved it so much I bought one for myself 3 months later. Then 1 week ago (10 months into ownership) the screen showed signs of burn-in. A pink hue spread out from the bottom of the screen and now has started to form black spots with the rest of the screen retaining text and icons from the previous screen. It is so disappointing. Contacting the FGS shopfront that sold it gave me nothing, they just said \"sorry\"... I am not very happy about their response, and will let other consumers know about this.Contacting Samsung has also been less than easy. Their US website is useless for an international version of the phone that I bought because of the carrier tie-ups they have and their site does not even make provision for the GT-I9000. Direct email is unanswered also. Very disappointed in the manufacturer.Although I loved this phone, the failure of the major component (this is a touch screen phone after all) in less than a year makes the investment unjustifiable. I want a phone that works for at least 12 months if I am paying $600. I cared for it correctly. Never dropped it (I was very protective of my pocket baby) and to have this happen is very troubling.Buyer beware.Chuck", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome", "Author": "Ali", "ReviewID": "R21A6RR49R53LR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I placed my order, I was kinda doubtful about my decision, but once I received it, I thought I would never change it with an iphone!!!

But this international version does not have Digital TV as an option, although the Brazilian Version sold here comes with, but has a very higher price (almost double price). As we can find in so many differents reviews, this phones lacks a flash for its camera, but still the Photo pictures at night shoots have a very good quality.I already upgraded to Android 2.2.1, that makes it a little bit faster.I did have some trouble using its GPS without a 3G or wifi connection, because the Google Maps probably need some kind of internet connection, but you can download other GPS navigators.I highly recommend this Smartphone.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy S", "Author": "kozerog1", "ReviewID": "R1XZ8KJS1E8DMP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The main issue was that \"Recovery\" and \"Download\" modes did not work on that phone.

Root it and install Titanium backup2. Install a screen protector to protect that gorgeous screen as well as a protective shell3. Get an additional micro sd card for additional storage.This isn't a phone for your mom because things can get a little tricky for novices or non tech savvy people.

Major (and largely expected) features include a 4.27-inch 800 x 480 Super AMOLED Plus display, an 8 megapixel primary camera with 1080p video capture accompanied by a 2 megapixel cam up front, Gingerbread with TouchWiz 4.0, integrated NFC support (on some versions), and a shell measuring just 8.49mm thick, making it likely the thinnest smartphone ever to roll off an assembly line -- in fact, it's over 0.2mm slimmer than the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc's thinnest point. The biggest news here, though, might be that Sammy's going with an NVIDIA Tegra 2 core -- the same as the LG Optimus 2X, Motorola Atrix 4G, and Droid Bionic -- despite the fact that its own Exynos 4210 was just announced for March production.Update: We were originally told that the Galaxy S II would be using an NVIDIA Tegra 2 SOC, but have been informed that was incorrect -- the phone will indeed have a dual-core 1GHz Samsung chip, and quite possibly the Exynos. There's also 1GB of RAM.We were able to spend a little bit of time with the Galaxy S II today, and we can conclusively say that this is one gorgeous device. It shares the Infuse 4G's aspirations as an ultra-thin Android device and arguably shares most of its industrial design elements, but interestingly, the Infuse steps down from 4.5 to 4.3 inches -- either a nod to the fact that 4.5 is too big for a mainstream smartphone, or a sign that the 4.5-inch Super AMOLED Plus component simply isn't ready yet. You totally notice how ridiculously thin the phone is as it rests in your hand, and the effect is amplified by the fact that it's got so much surface area -- the screen-to-edge ratio is off the charts. Though we still prefer the stock Android experience, TouchWiz 4.0 (as it's being called) on top of Gingerbread is clearly Samsung's most refined custom Android skin to date; a new Game Hub in ROM has potential to do battle with Sony's PlayStation Suite and allows developers to bypass the download size limits of the Android Market, but we weren't able to test it on the preproduction unit we were given.Owing to a lack of time and connectivity, we weren't able to put the phone through a suite of speed tests, but the entire UI felt perfect fast and smooth, a testament to the processor's chops. As at CES, we were blown away by the clarity and brightness of the Super AMOLED Plus display -- picture the already-excellent Super AMOLED technology amped up on steroids, and you'll have a good sense of what we're talking about here. All told, this seems like a great upgrade to the Galaxy S; if anything, we're a little concerned that it's going to be a smidge too big for people that were perfectly happy at the 4-inch tier, but odds are good Samsung will continue to crank out smaller devices for those folks. It'll be on the market in parts of Europe and Asia as soon as this month; no word on North America, but as always, there's little doubt Samsung has some plans in the works.

In reality, I do not like the ridiculously small keyboard of the 9700 and hate the fact that when I respond to emails, the cumbersome keyboard induces typo's to the point I could appear as an illiterate ESL person. The one thing a smart phone must do, in my opinion, is get my business related emails to me within reason.While the Galaxy S is a phenomenal TOY, but it cannot be excused or used as business device. The variance in email delivery can range from after 1 minute (compared to the BB), to hopefully, while the earth still spins on a 23.44 degree axis.I normally get 150-230 emails per day consistently during a 24hr period; last night I didn't get any between 7pm - 10:15 this morning on this device. The whole purpose of smartphones is to be able to survive without a laptop/desktop while on the move and email management is the Achilles heel of the Samsung; this was my first Droid, and now i question the entire platform.If you can live without email delivery, it is a cool device.  Feature rich, superb internet (compared to the BB) browsing, extremely flexible in terms of configuration, and very quick when it wasn't doing a random reboot even when there wasn't any actual usage (because emails weren't delivered).  Also not being able to disable AT&T;'s BS Apps....not cool.This was a phone I really tried to like, and do for some reasons, but in the end - anything that made me actually want a cumbersome blackberry back has a long way to go.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$979.99", "Features": "Network: HSUPA 900/1900/2100, EDGE/GPRS 850/900/1800/1900.
