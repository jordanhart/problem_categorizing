I had the GS3 before and mostbof the features you had to find butnthis one shows you and they all work great. The eye scroll on websites gets annoying when your reading something and look down slightly but ive come to get used to it. Amazing screen and very responsive. I had actually but the international version of the galaxy s3 and it turned out to be a fake. So I'm very happy that this one was the International but it was real. You can tell by the screen. Its not AMOLED screen then its a fake.
