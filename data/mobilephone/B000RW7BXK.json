{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Krazy for KRZR K1 Cosmic Blue", "Author": "L", "ReviewID": "R26WE416NH7OX2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally decided to get rid of my Verizon cell phone (LG 8300) , freed myself from their contract and went with an unlocked GSM cell phone.  I did a lot of research on phones that offered what I wanted at a reasonable price yet maintaining at least a 4 out of 5 star rating.  If you want alot of the bells and whistles, then this phone is for you.  I'm Krazy about this phone.  The ergonomics is fabulous!The glitches that I've had were:a.  having to contact AT&T; since I couldn't get on the web and send/receive pictures.  Tech. support was able to rectify the problem within 1 1/2 hours.b.  they do not offer an extended battery for unlocked GSM cell phones.  Why Motorola?  It is good to have a spare battery just in case of an emergency.You may want to also purchase the body glove case for the phone.  If you do, you'll be quite pleased.With its large memory storage, removable memory card, camera, speakerphone, call clarity, mp3 player, and more ... I'll hold onto this phone for years to come.  Way to go Motorola!", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good if Real from Motorola", "Author": "W. Manning", "ReviewID": "RVN0IFRJQJ39H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "this was ordered after the last one died.  this was our 3rd one but the first one that was not real...as in I believe is a counterfeit...The vendor hp.electronics labeled as a new w/warranty but the words in the phone are misspelled!  The phone does not have all of the ring tones...it does not have a regular ring ring...the vendor refunded partial of payment due to no owners manual and missing cords.  The picture listed showing all to come was not to be.  The photo copy manual was a joke at only 5 pages.  Our fault for trying to buy a phone that seems not to be in production any longer.  In the process of looking for a new one...The vendor had called me over 10 times wanting me to remove my rating of them...this is a con...people need to know where to spend there hard earned money. DO NOT USE THIS VENDOR.  The calls to my cell phone and MY WORK are to the point of being harassment.  This phone was great when manufactured by Motorola but now these offered are knockoffs...Look elsewhere for a new production phone...look at the dates of the reviews.  My fault for not knowing better.  I have learned a lesson.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Voice Phone", "Author": "A.P", "ReviewID": "R3CRB8B9Y5J627", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a KRZR K1 unlocked phone (I got a silver version) to replace a broken cell phone.  I was looking for something with great voice quality and standard features such as a simple camera, voice dialing, and basic texting.  I have been thrilled with how this phone has performed.  First and foremost, the voice quality is great.  While I know my previous phone was cheap, I thought that the voice quality and erratic signal were due to my ATT service.  With this phone, my coverage area and reception are much much improved, and I can hear most everything.  There is a good voice-dialing program, and the camera is passable with a low-res camcorder.  Texting has also been very good.  Overall, I've been very pleased and satisfied, and I recommend it for anyone looking for a good non-smartphone.", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Choice!", "Author": "S.

Bell \"taco\"", "ReviewID": "R365OMZSO2M81H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, I have been very pleased with the KRZR.  It is sleek, user friendly, holds a charge well, etc.  I have noticed, however, two problems.  First, the clarity of calls (without speaker phone) isn't as good as the RAZR.  Second, the interface is kind of confusing and some options aren't where they should logically be.  Otherwise, as long as you are comfortable with the size of the buttons, I would certainly recommend this phone!", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Warren", "Author": "Warren A.

Should have the software as pictures do not download.

The colors really pop on the screen.  I found that the sound quality was very good.  I was really impressed with the battery life on this phone.  The only thing I was diappointed with was the Manual.  It looked like a re-production and left out some information.  But overall this phone met my expectations.", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "I had to search the internet to find another KRZR", "Author": "Magic Rottweiler", "ReviewID": "R255EH41MBB8FT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved my 1st KRZR so much I searched the interent to find a new one rather than try some new phone with more things to break. I use a laptop, not my phone, for the internet so I am very happy with my purchase. ATT was not happy with me asking where did I get it, but they just want me to buy into a contract and need all new accessories.Thank you", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "WOW awsome phone", "Author": "Tanya C", "ReviewID": "R3N28KJ01BF2D4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an incredible phone. After using an LG VU and wondering if I would receive my calls,stay connected to a call, or be able to hear/understand the person I was talking to due to so much static, this phone is wonderful. I still have AT&T; so obviously my problems were with the phone. I highly recommend the Motorola KRZR K1 as well as UnlockedCellPhonekings as the place to purchase it. I received my phone 3 days after I ordered it.", "Date": "January 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Unhappy Customer", "Author": "Thomas A.

Awkward differences", "Author": "VBRO", "ReviewID": "R1K4QXOSOVTBB9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned three or four true U.S. version KRZRs, and the one shipped is clearly an international version. There are awkward differences. Screen layout/customization/preferences are not as good as the U.S.I can tolerate certain spelling variations but the U.S. version was advertised and not shipped.Returning until I find an honest seller.  Otherwise I like the basic phone (preferrably U.S.) obviously after owning several. Great for voice/text users.

Everything was very good with this phone, until I removed the stickers from the phone about a week after initial use. Then it gradually started picking up tiny dust particles (it was never exposed to a particularly dusty environment) inside the outer LCD display. You can't wipe it clean, and it was getting to the point where it would have obstructed the display totally given enough time. I am hoping it was just that unit, but now I am in a wait mode before I place an order for the same model or a different phone.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "good looking phone", "Author": "slim jim \"jim\"", "ReviewID": "R20KLLFK90EM3U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very good looking phone.works well in all catagories.only drawback is the keys are a little small.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "So Far - So good", "Author": "M.
