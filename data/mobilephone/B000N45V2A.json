{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not a good buy!", "Author": "Adebisi A. Ilori \"beecee\"", "ReviewID": "RUTM1KJTKBOZO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "only reason i gave 3 stars was because the phone feels cheap.The phone is exactly the way it was described, but coming from Nokia and at that price i expected something more \"solid\". Though, the phone does work and does all it says it can do. the cheap platic feeel is what i dont like. About the phone being\"unbreakable\" i doubt it. The sim card cover almost broke when i was trying to open it. If you dont mind the cheap feel, go for it. It works.16/11/08I am adding this review after using the phone for about 5 months.1. The battery is a washout. I have had to replace the battery since the one that came with the phone stopped working  about  month ago.2. The screen goes off by itself even with a fully charged battery.3. Some of the buttons choose when they want to work and when they do not choose to, they do not workConclusion: This phone is an imitation of Nokia. I cannot believe Nokia will allow  such poor workmanship in their phones. i have two other Nokia phones which i have been using for years without problems. My candid advice: Avoid this phone!", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Cell phone; UNIQUE, LIGHT, MULTI-PURPOSE", "Author": "J.
