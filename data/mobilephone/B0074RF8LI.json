I figured well maybe its just me, either way took it to Verizon and they had a problem programming the phone..well, I decided to get all the guess work out. The phone was NOT NEW, but USED and it was NOT a Verizon Phone.Sent it back via Amazon. Love Amazon...they know what to do...I mean the phone was over 600.00  dollars why would anyone think people would not notice these things.They took it back, even apologized, well of course...Don't cheat honest people, not all of us are unaware of what we get!", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "At Last I Have a iPhone", "Author": "SBranigan", "ReviewID": "R1J3MS1E4F6EP9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No contract, unlimited data plan and a phone that works!The condition of the iPhone is great, I'm completely happy with this purchase.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great job but....", "Author": "Bug Lady \"Bug Lady\"", "ReviewID": "RACVIS33F444Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The seller did a really good job on shipping quickly.  I received the phone before the estimated due date which was great.  What wasn't so great was the condition of the phone.  It wasn't like new at all.  The bottom part where the charging port is was all dented.  There were also markings on the top part of the phone where the power button is situated.  Amazon's description of Used - Like New: An apparently untouched item in perfect condition. Original protective wrapping may be missing, but the original packaging is intact and pristine. There are absolutely no signs of wear on the item or its packaging. Instructions are included. Item is suitable for presenting as a gift.There were no instructions and no box.  The phone had been put in bubblewrap and shoved in a postage box with the accessories.  Additionally, the \"free accessories\" that were provided had seen better days.  The otterbox case was supposed to be white but it was so dirty and scratched it couldn't have been used.Now this may seem like I'm nit-picking but I really am not.  I expected a like new phone and didn't get one.  When you fork out $349 and it doesn't meet your expectations, it's very disappointing.  Not to mention the fact it's a lot of money.Overall the seller was understanding, although he stood by his description and said the condition is subjective and down to the end users interpretation.  Misleading in my book.  So the phone was returned and I did get a full refund - thankfully.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone!", "Author": "amw7464", "ReviewID": "R2CB0XEOVG1UBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Once you go Apple you will never go Back!

In fact, I'm using it right now! What's much to say about it?I absolutely love my phone. Although I'm not very fond of apple's products, but this phone is very versatile. Many people who hate iphones have androids, droids, google phones, etc. What it boils down to is that the iPhone is very simple and easy to use. It's very hard to get confused using this phone, and it could do just about anything any other phones can do. Besides, aren't all phones about the same these days?
