From personal use this cellphone works flawlessly! Never an issue! With slide out keyboard and excellent color graphics it's a fantastic value! If a person is looking for a handy size cellphone, with excellent features, and reasonably priced, they should consider the Samsung Messager Touch!!!", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its okay", "Author": "Alicia Smith", "ReviewID": "RPM78XNVQWZZ1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not what I was expecting.

It slides up and has a full keyboard. It is easy to use and navigate. When I receive texts or phone calls the phone rings or vibrates until you tell it not to. With other phones, including Galaxy 2 and a Kuwai I currently had, unless you are paying attention, you never realize you received texts unless you are contantly checking! What a waste of life to be constantly checking for texts or messages when your bloody phone can make you aware that you have either voice mail or texts. This phone is a no nonsense phone. I wish other modern phones were as smart as this one. I am looking for one but the only one they are selling is $99 used! That is what I paid for mine 4 years ago, it was good until it gave up the ghost (screen went kaput) 2 months ago. Since then I had had other phones that just have made my life miserable. I miss this phones features.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm so sad.", "Author": "Mona", "ReviewID": "R3Q3462Y608RA5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was my fault that I didn't read the full description but in my defence, I typede in phone from Cricket Wireless and this popped up. Since it IS from Allltel, it wasn't fully flashed and was a waste of my money honestly. And I like the keyboard but I wanted a touch screen also that typed but this doesn't.
