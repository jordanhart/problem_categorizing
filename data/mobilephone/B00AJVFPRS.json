My Galaxy S 4G's screen cracked and the insurance wound not replace it, so I need a cheap replacement and this fits the bill! Responds fast, and doesn't lock up like the Samsung did all the time, only negative thing is the internal memory is very low 256k, the old Samsung had 514k and that was too low for my applications!

For it's price, it is fast, call quality was iphone clear and all downloads were pretty quick also.It fits nicely into my hand and did everything a cell phone was supposed to do.Now the bad:Battery life gets me maybe a half day and it takes hours to get to a full charge. Lately it just stopped reading my SD card from out of nowhere. Would not format it or anything. The battery will not hold a charge for more than 4 hours now.

And that is the BLU Dash 3.5's greatest strength.The design isn't that bad. I like the curvy body, making it easier to hold than most newer square-ish smartphones. However, it is a cheap phone and it definitely feels like one. Back is shiny white plastic, slippery. Screen is low-res (or maybe I'm just too used to high-density LCDs. The phone works fine, but it's on an ancient build of Android making it even slower than it should be.Taking everything into account though, it /is/ feature-full and something you wouldn't have to hesitate giving your child (in fear of it getting stolen, cause nobody would want to steal it).", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible Battery", "Author": "Sarah Lewis-Stowe", "ReviewID": "R22QDVYSX7COG4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is honestly such a cute phone. It comes with a bunch of different colored back pieces, and extra battery, and it's a great size. Unfortunately the battery life on it is terrible. I bought it for my fianc\u00e9, since we go overseas during the summertime, and I thought the dual-sim would be really handy. It's a great idea, honestly. It just has the one problem with its battery life. I can't comment much on its operating system, since I am an apple user. It's an android, and I'm not very tech savvy, so I didn't play with it too much as I found its set-up to be a bit confusing. Anyway, I ended up buying him a Samsung Galaxy Mini (since they're about the same size) and he loves it. He really just couldn't deal with the short battery life on this phone.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problems with  two chip usage", "Author": "Paul Shaffer \"paul\"", "ReviewID": "R3OR3D7993C15H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am using phone oversaes. there is a problem when using two chips. the chips interfear with eachother, when only using one chip the phone works great. but thats not why i bought it. i need the duel chips because of signal location. only one will get signal in one area and the other in ia different area. now i had to buy a cheap local phone to use my second chip. not pleased with phone for that reason. i am hoping that anybody else having this problem could advise how to correct.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "garbage!", "Author": "shine", "ReviewID": "R2NSZ86AI9WO3K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this is the worst phone i ever had in my life period not one good ting to say about it!!", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "Cellular Band - Quad-Band 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 Mhz\nCellular Band 3G - 850 / 1900 Mhz", "Name": "BLU Dash 3.5 D170a White Unlocked Dual SIM Phone with 1GHz Processor, Android 2.", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41j5FWA%2BhHL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AJVFPRS"}}
