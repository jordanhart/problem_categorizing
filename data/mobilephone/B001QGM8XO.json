{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone.  Glass faceplate breaks frequently", "Author": "Conrad B. Senior", "ReviewID": "RIG1BFAL89FBV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": ".I like the phone a lot. It has some features I have to have.  One is a USB charger.  Others are a good speakerphone and bluetooth capability.  It is also a slim design.  While it fits in my pocket ok, the glass faceplate has broken four times on three of these phones (I have an unlocked GSM phone I use in Europe).  You can buy new faceplates for a couple of bucks on eBay.  If you buy this phone, go ahead and order a couple so that you have them.Now, if you keep it in a leather pouch, the faceplate will survive longer.  My current phone has not lost one yet, but I can see one corner is coming up. I tried gluing these on with epoxy.  It doesn't work.Aside from this one hassle.  I love the phone. I'm about to buy one for my brother, but I will be ordering at least four glass replacement fronts, just so I won't have to wait if one breaks.  They cost about $5 for two and are shipped from China, so it take a couple of weeks to get them in.  Hence the advance purchase.NOTE THE GSM phone is slightly different from the Verizon version.  the GSM phone is narrower.  Both are beautiful phones.  They look elegant and people who see mine are impressed with it.Pros:  Sleek sexy looks.  USB power, camera, speakerphone, and Bluetooth.  It also has MP3 capability.  I don't use it for that.Negatives:  Glass front breaks frequently.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Motorola KRZR K1 Unlocked GSM Phone (Black)", "Author": "Luiz S.

Last month I lost my three-year old Samsung A670 so I bought a Motorola KRZR K1 because it was pretty-looking. A month later, my phone quited working, went to the local store and found the battery was dead. Plus, charging by computer function was never working with either my laptop or desktop. Maybe I got a lemon, and the customer service with Verizon was excellent, but I will never get another Motorola phone again", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "Travis Smith", "ReviewID": "R2LRA6HY5499NX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about 3 months now, its I love it!  It's super slim, super sexy and has a ton of features in a small, stylish package.  It has a 2 megapixel camera, which takes beautiful photos I might add, the ability to take video movie clips, a mini SD card slot which will read up to an 8GB mini SD slot, SMS and MMS capabilities, great sound and call quality, and its unlocked, so you can use it with any GSM provider in any country. (AT&T;, Cingular, and Verizon for the States).  The keypad is great, much better than the staggered Razr keypad, and it has a beatiful, bright, crisp screen which makes it easy to see in sunlight.  Overall its a superb phone that has all the standard features of a phone, but does them the right way, plus many other multi-media and other special features.

It looked like a cool phone with impressive features for its size however upon receiving my krzr it became extremely clear that motorola didn't put enough thought into its design or at least who the target market was. The phone is not ergonomically designed for a male hand unless you're under the age of 13. Moreover the glass finish on the front panel is far too delicate to be practical. If u are a normal human being you will scratch, break or in some way damage the face of this phone. This phone may however be perfect for people suffering from OCD and will treat the phone like a newborn. In conclusion I regret purchasing this phone the razr series is much nicer and I would recomend to anyone considering this phone to invest in a razr instead", "Date": "December 31, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$69.99", "Features": null, "Name": "MOTOROLA K1 BLACK RB(ALL ORIGINAL+BOX)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/218LFTJhLwL.jpg", "ProductID": "B001QGM8XO"}}
