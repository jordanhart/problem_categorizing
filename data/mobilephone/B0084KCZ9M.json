{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good little phone but be mindful..", "Author": "David W. Francis \"David Wayne\"", "ReviewID": "R2M7KBWEW3TRM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've just bought this phone. And I'm not trying to take business away from Amazon, but you can get this phone at Walmart for 99 dollars. That's not a bad price for an android. It will only work on Straight Talks 45 dollar plan. So you have an android with unlimited minutes. That's a steal in itself seeing how all of these other companies work. So you have all the apps available in the app store, or for free. I haven't really tailored my phone to fit my needs but I'm getting there. You also have youtube on this phone. I listened to it and its loud, and the screen is vibrant. you can watch youtube either face up or side ways its doesn't matter. You've got the GPS Navigational system, maps, WiFi. This phone is a 3G phone so if you're looking for a 3G phone and you don't want to pay an arm and a leg this is probably right up your alley. The phone is sleek and fits snug in your hand. I can't see it being overly bulky or anything. It has a 600hz processor and comes with a 4GB memory card already installed. and its an hc memory card. That gives you 18GB you can store on your phone for pictures, and music. It has wall paper and live wall paper. Although I've been told the live wall paper will drain your battery faster so regular should work fine.I like most everything on this phone but here is a draw back. Although I wouldn't call it a major draw back. The touch screen is sensitive. Maybe a little too sensitive. I have long fingers, so that may be the case. You have to try a few times on the key pad to get what you want. Some times you have to add the word to your dictionary when typing. But it usually autocorrects, and its nice to have the word there even if you have to add it. Just remember that this thing is very sensitive, so be patient with it and take your time. If you're impatient learn to be patient, and this shouldn't be a problem. Web surfing is no problem. You have your standard stuff here. Facebook, weather, etc. Phone is fast enough for me. It has a 5 megapixel camera and video. The pictures so far are pretty good. I haven't taken any video yet but I will post a follow up once I've had the phone for a while. You guys here know I pull no punches with my reviews. So beside the touch screen being over sensitive I really like this phone so far. So we'll see where we are in a few months. But right now I'm loving it.Talk quality is really good. It's very clear without in static in the background. The charger has a plug and usb cable. you plug up the usb cable to the plug and tada. Also has an ear phone jack so you can listen to youtube or whatever else. Bluetooth capability. Do yourself a favor and check it out if you're in the market a new phone.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Markiee", "ReviewID": "R2T4L4MJEF3PIN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone at walmart for 99 dollars. It is a great cheap android phone that works well for basic tasks like facebook,calling,texting and some lighter games. Don't expect this to run games like GTA 3 at all more like angry birds and fruit ninja casual games like that. It doesn't run flash but that's okay because you can either use the youtube app or a web browser. In My Opinion the web browser is easier for youtube than the  youtube app because in my experiences the youtube app tends to buffer for a very long time.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Huawei Ascend 2 Review", "Author": "Andrea H.", "ReviewID": "RQL8USEA47OVU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have this phone now and it sucks.

It endlessly freezes, I've reset it 3 times, the browser constantly crashes, it overheats, and always drops calls, additionally the signal for out of state is absolutely terrible. and I have requested a replacement, and ST won't send me a different model even though the darn thing is insured. They still want to send the same phone, even though I have explained that it sucks, and I don't want another one like it. It seams that these models were made with defects, which is why EVERYONE has problems with them. I advise against purchasing one of these. If you are planning on an android, buy a Samsung, LG, or some other brand. DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE!  I personally will NEVER buy one, or any phone like it again.

Awful.", "Author": "Annie T", "ReviewID": "R3TUHC2IMJ9SKQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for 1 year (via CRICKET) - purchased summer 2012.  It's awful.  It has no grit, no real \"power\".  It started defaulting to a different language when texting (predictive text) and it would default to random #'s in the texts.  Like if I wanted to say something like \"meet you guys at 6:30\" it would default to something like \"meet you guys at 6:mnpe120ndxz230zlp63a\"  Anyway, regarding it changing languages, I'd have to go back into \"setting\" and redirect it to English.  Over & over.  Like every 2 weeks.Cricket told me a couple of months ago that since they \"updated their cell towers\", this phone just can't handle the upgrade.Don't buy it.  Also, it would throw out random stuff occasionally when I needed the GPS.  It would work great about 70% of the time - the other 30% it wouldn't have a clue re: basic directions, like driving 2 blocks to a certain bank.It's a gutless phone.  It's just way too weak, in my opinion, to be of much use.  Recently went with the Samsung Galaxy S4.  A WORLD of difference, which won't surprise anyone.I wouldn't spend any time thinking about this phone as a viable option.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "crap phone, good service straight talk", "Author": "JaredK", "ReviewID": "R3RUZUJ2DWS55Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this phone as a gift 4 months ago now and I can't wait to get a different one (its the $100 Walmart straight talk version).

We were told if purchasing this phone that it would be the $45, 30 day plan. I am used to the $30 plan, but for this phone, $15 more may be worth it, also we were told that the Android phones are operated by Sprint and we were shown a map of the areas the Android phones cover. I was surprised to see that this phone along with the other android phones Straight talk offer have less coverage than the cheaper phones with $30 plans.So, basically you are paying $99.88 (at Walmart) for a possibly great phone with $15 extra each month (if you are accustomed to the $30 plan) with significantly less coverage.
