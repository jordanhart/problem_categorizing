This phone came in what looked like good condition. Very clean. Looked like new. I was very careful so it'd last me a thousand years. But after about a month, a tiny hairline fracture in the hinge started to open up. I hadn't dropped it or anything. It became obvious that it was a refurbishing defect, a problem that was there from the previous owner. And it continued to crack further and pop.... I put some PVC pipe wrap tape on it to keep it from breaking further. This was to prevent it from closing or opening. Sad. It kept breaking more until the wires were exposed. I keep it wrapped around the hinge in PVC tape to keep it where it needs to be. It works ok. Just permanently open.  I just love this phone so much, the way it works, that I can't stand to get another phone. Great little phone. Too bad about the refurbish job not taking.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "My teenager loves it!", "Author": "thefinderofthings \"Kelsey Graybill\"", "ReviewID": "R1IH40S95H21CN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I asked my 17 year old what kind of phone she wanted.
