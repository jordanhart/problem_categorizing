This item DID NOT come in the original iPhone box.2. The charger for the iPhone DOES NOT work.3. When information from amazon was confusing at first during a chat session, the seller didn't even read the PDF file attached to a complaint including such confusing information, and I got customer service in a very rude and unpleasant attitude. I was even threatened to be reported to Amazon, situation that never happened and I have e-mails and evidence to proove it.4. I got 10 usd in reward from amazon for the whole situation, which DOES NOT compensate all I went through.Conclusion: I still have a locked phone with Sprint with a charger that doesnt work, and my problem remains unsolved.Sorry but if there was a chance to give MedMedia246 half a star or even a NEGATIVE rate i would definetely do it.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPhone 4S Pretty Simple to Use for a Novice", "Author": "electronicnut", "ReviewID": "R1X70QNEB6X1UB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my wife a few months ago since I felt that she needed to get on the smartphone bandwagon.  She was using an older Samsung Reality with the physical keyboard.  She was just a basic phone and text kind of gal, so I thought about the best phone that would ease her into the \"smartphone world\".I feel the Android OS does need a little more time to get used to with all the widgets and configuration on how you want your apps to display.  There is also an occasional freeze on the older Android OS such as gingerbread and froyo (not so much with ICS and jelly bean though)  The iPhone OS, however, is more simplified for a novice because it has a predefined layout that every user would see and no widgets (I had a feeling that she was going to hold down on the screen too long and delete or move something and wonder what happened to it)  So I thought this was a perfect choice for her.My wife was surprised by the change.  She loved the crisp, clean retina display, the beautiful images it took, and the overall ease of using the phone.  I even showed her that she could now text in a different language, which she never thought was possible with a phone.  She learned how to use the phone quickly, used apps such as Kakao Talk to talk to friends from Korea.  The phone has Siri, but she never uses it.  Although she loves the phone, she only had one complaint...the Sprint 3G network.She complained the 3G was too slow to even browse the internet or watch the occasional Youtube video when she is on the go.  I let her know that the 3G network on Sprint is not good in our area and possibly other areas as well.  I told her hopefully when her contract is up, we could switch carriers or if 4G LTE ever comes available, we could opt for a new phone. Sprint has unlimited data, but the speeds are pretty terrible at the 3G level.So to sum it up, the Apple iPhone 4S is great a phone.  The phone on the Sprint 3G network in my area is slow.  Sprint 3G speeds may be better in your area, but I read on Sprint message boards that people are mentioning the slowness as well.  So something to keep in mind if your shopping for the iPhone 4S for this carrier.", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect!", "Author": "avery richardson", "ReviewID": "R4LMELMQL623N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Came in yesterday!

I recently bought an iPhone 4s off of Amazon from ArYanna Evans for a total of $289.99. I am very furious with this seller because she lied about this item on her account. I have emailed her several times about my problems but she is adamant about not refunding my money. I feel as if she should because of the lie about my phone being scratch in the upper left hand corner when it is actually cracked. I feel as if her pictures were a misrepresentation as well seeing as how I saw no crack in the corner of the shots. I was willing to ignore the crack so I took it to the sprint store to change my phone. When the representative was looking at it she notice it was not deactivated, so she looked at the serial number and found out the account did not belong to Ms. Evans which made this phone seem stolen.  Soon after, I emailed Ms. Evans back to let her know it hasn\u2019t been deactivated and she has yet to deactivate or respond to my latest email. There\u2019s nothing I can do with this phone.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "FULL review of the iPhone 4S, Apple vs Google.", "Author": "JoJo", "ReviewID": "R4CAH2W9TSGBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPhone 4S is a really great device to have and play around. I started this review just to give the Apple iPhone a fair shake and to truly understand what exactly I hate about the iPhone and why I talk down to it so much. I have been an Android fan since the first day Google announced their first phone the G1, after that day I loved Android. However this review is not what I hate about the iPhone rather the features between the two platforms.HARDWARE:The iPhone 4S is Apple's current phone and the physical hardware of the phone makes it look elegant and professional. The Phone comes in two different colors, White and Black. I love how the phone has a mute/unmute rocker switch on the left side of the phone, although I can turn on the phone and turn the volume down this little yet helpful feature made my life so much more easier. The phone is made out of a 3.5 inch edge-to-edge glass front and back with an aluminum band all around the side of the phone. Everything about this phone feels premium and sturdy however knowing this is made out of glass also made me worry more. If I were ever to drop this phone on any hard surface above 4 feet or higher will shatter the glass. At the bottom of the phone lives the speakers, this is a BONUS for me because I often lay my phone either face down or have the phone lay on its back and on most phones the speaker is on the back. Having the speaker on the bottom of the phone helps prevent any noise muffling or reduce the quality of sound. The back is where the camera and flash is located. This phone carries an 8 megapixel lens that is capable of capturing full 1080p videos and pictures. The photos on this camera is pretty decent and the video play back is also amazing however I expected more after hearing from everyone how great the camera quality was.SOFTWARE:The iPhone 4S is currently running IOS 5.1.1 however I manage to install IOS 6 BETA 2 on the phone to see what feature I will have if I do decide to stick with this phone. IOS6 won't be release until Fall. IOS 6 is really plain and simple any child, grandparents, or even parents could pick up the device and know how to navigate there way. The apps in the Apple Store are very useful to manage my daily life and also help me manage my finance like the app MINT. Texting on this phone took me a while to get used too and after two weeks I am still not that perfectly comfortable texting. I don't like the fact I have to long press on a word and move the magnification glass to the exact letter I want to fix because of auto spell. Also the dictionary on this phone really irritates me, if I want to add a word to my dictionary I would have to go to Settings/ General/ Keyboard/ Add New Shortcut and add the word soooooo annoying. I want it where I can tap on the word and just add it to my dictionary right when i'm texting. However the keys are perfectly spaced out, i'm just not used to texting with a small screen I am used to 4.5inch screens and above. I travel a lot so a navigational app is a MUST app for me. The IOS 5.1.1 currently does not have a turn-by-turn navigation system built in the OS (operating system) and after testing the GPS (global positioning system) out it provided the long route and sometimes they were wrong. The new IOS6 does have turn-by-turn navigation and after testing this GPS out I only had one issue with it, it sometimes take me to the longer route (but no biggy I guess). Siri is sometimes helpful and can minimize time depending what you ask it. I noticed asking Siri to remind me to call someone or remind me to do something was the best feature for me because sometimes typing it out would take too long. The Geo-Location on this phone works perfectly, for those who doesn't know what that is. If you need to remember something you can ask Siri to remind you to call or do something once you leave or get to a place and when you get there Siri will remind you through a popup notification without any time input. The Note and Reminder app will sync to any Apple computer, unfortunately unable to sync with PC (SAD LIFE FOR DAYS). Adding music, photos, movies, or anything else on this phone is pretty simple. Just plug in your iPhone and connect it to iTunes (Apples way to manage your apps and stuff) and select what you want to import. The WIFi (wireless fidelity also known for wireless networking) on this phone is really slow and downloading apps could sometimes take some time depending how many apps you are trying to download. The phone app is crystal clear but I did notice the volume was a little low and even though my hearing is not that great, compared to other devices you can definitely notice the difference. I never once got a drop call and being on the Sprint Network I always had phone signal everywhere I go however once I go through heavy walls in a building like the Best Buy staff lounge my signals was very weak. The New notification is very useful and being able to still get into my notification center while in a game or other full screen apps is a BIG plus for me.CONCLUSION:I do recommend this phone to those who want something simple, easy, and have something reliable at all times. However if you want a phone that has up-to-date GPS and travels a lot then consider Android. This phone is really great and don't have much complains other than those I mentioned above. Let me know what you think and if I left anything out I do apologize this is just several feature I noticed while using this phone for two weeks. This is just my personal opinion sharing to the world.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not the right phone!", "Author": "Angie", "ReviewID": "R1YIYXNAFLFR8F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ended up returning the phone!

My 18 y/o daughter purchased this Sprint phone from snsandrze, thinking she could use it with Boost Mobile, being that Boost is a subsidiary of Sprint. Unfortunately because of her age she didn't realize that it doesn't work that way and she was unable to use the phone with Boost. I contacted the seller about returning the phone and explained what had happened and that I would pay the return postage. He responded initially that it wasn't his fault that the phone didn't work with Boost and that he would NOT take the phone back. After much back and forth between he and I he agreed to take the phone back but he was going to charge my daughter a 20% \"restocking fee\", which is NOT allowed under Amazon policy for it's vendors. I then contacted Amazon directly and filed an A to Z Claim. They approved my claim and refunded my daughters money back to her credit card. I was then contacted again by snsandrze, the seller, and was almost accosted for going directly to Amazon and was seriously asked by him if I truly thought I could return something without any \"consequences\"? Are you kidding me?! Consequences? Who does this idiot think he is?! Regardless, I actually have NO issues with the phone as we never got a chance to use it, but for a retailer to think that they can penalize you or try to prevent you from returning ANY product within the 30 day time period, is absolutely ludicrous and the reason for the 1 star rating! My problem is with THIS seller and I implore ANY and ALL of you who read this to stay AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE from the crook known as snsandrze!!! Good luck.  P.S. snsandrze also got stuck with the return postage.

The metal frame is bent at the top of the phone, making it hard to use a case. The flash doesn't work. The camera has dark spots, the charger that came with the phone doesn't work. The speaker is blown, and people can't hear me. I contacted the seller, and the response was quick, but it was as useful as not contacting them at all. They offered to repair everything minus the metal frame, but I'd have to send the phone back on my dollar, and be stuck without a phone until they sent it back. Nothing else. Of course, I didn't send it back.

They did a hard factory reset, it is still locked to AT&T.; It is an expensive paperweight now.  The phone was advertised to be in \"very good condition\" I would say the chipped glass corners, different SIM tray, the various scratches all over the phone, is NOT \"very good\" , maybe \"fair condition\" but no way in a \"very good condition\". The seller refused to accept that there were irregularities with the IEMI in SIM tray versus the IEMI within the phone , the quality of the phone  as I stated above and he made excuses such as \"you were sent the right phone, someone switched them in the mail\".

It is easy to use and very light weight.  It is a touch screen phone which can sometimes be bad because it can get dirty, but you can clean it.It has a camera on the front and back which makes it easy to take pictures.  It also has access to the internet, tons of fun and useful apps, lots of fun options for ringtones, and last but not least, it has Siri.  Siri is a voice activated robot in the phone that you can ask a question and she will give you lots of possible answers.The iPhone has a button in the center that when you click it, it takes you to the home page.  It also has a button at the top right that locks the screen.  Another fun thing is the iPhone 4s can come in white or black.  The only thing I have a problem with is when you zoom in on the camera, the picture gets blurry which is really irritating.I would recommend this product if you are looking for a phone with a quick and easy alarm clock, or a calendar that you can bring with you wherever you go.  I would also recommend this product that you can take quick pictures with.Overall, I really like this product because of the fun, quick, and easy contents it has.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like Brand New", "Author": "Betsy", "ReviewID": "R1I6B7N80NUVNZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No complaints!
