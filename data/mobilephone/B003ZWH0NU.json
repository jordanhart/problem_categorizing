I bought one used on from a supplier here on Amazon, the phone died on me three weeks later, so I brought it back into the metro store where I had insurance, they ordered me a new one, it constantly freezes, I cannot view the home screen, the keys lock up. I don't know what happened because back in the day, blackberry was a sturdy, user friendly reliable phone. now it seems to be so cheaply made and the network it runs on is terrible. I'm very disappointed that a phone I used to love because of its reliability is now just a piece of crap. personally I don't think its the phone per say, metro is selling refurbished phones to consumers. I have purchase phones brand new that died a couple months later. metro needs a class action lawsuit for fraudulent business practices.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Had this for 2 years now, but the good times are over.........", "Author": "K4m1L", "ReviewID": "R141FQWHF34QCC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone a long time ago, Blackberrys always looked the same and meant status and position in life.This one was a good companion for a quite a while and I liked it for the most part...though there are more than a few things annoying about it.8530 came with a single core 528MHz ARM11 processor, 2MP camera (without flash), a very decent keyboard (my Ironworker fingers can type without much trouble) and a couple less important things.Let me just get to the good and the bad about it:Pros:Keyboard;MP3/video player;the ease of adding files to SD card;very good sound (loud);start-up time;size - fits in the palm of my hand;external MP3 player control buttons;build quality (I kicked and threw it more than once and it worked like new);decent WIFI connectivity;OpenGL ES 2.1 support;Cons:slow CPU;small screen;very short battery life;lame WIFI transmit speed;Recently, I wanted to buy a new phone but I was kinda apprehensive to let go of this phone :DDon't care how many iPhones get released - I still think they are frigile asian made trash - if this 8530 had faster (Dual-Core) CPU and a better/bigger screen it would still be my phone even today. Unfortunately a week ago my BB started to act-up and would lose network coverage, every few minutes it would go out of service, drop calls and generally annoy me as hell - I really don't know what happened to it. Now as BB brand got basically forgotten by most ex-users it's almost impossible to find a reliable service place where they could take a look at it, but than again a good technician will probably charge a lot to fix it anyway - considering one can get this BB from ~$80 today I don't think it's worth it.The thing that convinced me that I need a new phone was the \"BB Protect\" backup experience - it just sucks !!!!!!!!I have over 130 #'s to people I know and now I can get them out of this damn backup without a working BB connected to a service - basically BB takes your info and protects it to a point where me - the owner of those contacts - can't get them out if I decide to leave the BB brand - BS !!!!!!! JOKE !!!!I figure the only option I have is to buy a new BB from here and use that to get what I need.Hope this works.Anyway, it was a good phone always reliable and always there when I need to make a call, text, use GPS or just listen to music so I don't have to listen to people on the train.It's also worth to mention this BB supports OpenGL ES 2.1 - not that there were or are any good BB games that use it (except Aces BrickBracker 3D & PBA Bowling 2), maybe if developers took time to make full use of it.............The events of the last few days won't affect my score as 2 years for any cellphone is really pushing it considering how fast technology moves today.Peace.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waste of money!", "Author": "racharooo", "ReviewID": "R8ZB3ZBG1W9EB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I loved this phone for everything but its battery life. Once I gave it a new battery I thought it would be fine but it was worse. A twenty minute phone call drains all of the battery. I took my phone to Metro PCS and the woman took the back off and showed me that it was water damaged! I've only been using the thing for two weeks and I know it wasn't from me.

It usually sells at MetroPCS for 140 dollars which I wasn't willing to pay for a phone. I was skeptical because it was used, I haven't ordered from Amazon before, and I didn't know the company that was selling it. Everything was great. I got the phone the first expected day of shipping. I've ordered from other websites that take so long so this was a pleasant surprise. Also, I thought the screen would be scratched or the phone would look used but it looked brand new. A charger and battery were included. The software had been reset so there wasn't a hassle about deleting things or not being able to access anything. I am a happy amazoner.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good phone", "Author": "P", "ReviewID": "RTMNGMNM0AOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Blackberry, cause i've always wanted one.

AVOID METRO PCS", "Author": "New Yorker \"yogini\"", "ReviewID": "R170HFKNIS57O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I know this review should be for the phone, but if you get it attached to MetroPCS, you will regret it.I have had a metro PCS phone for 2 months. I paid my monthly fee and my payment was confirmed. I was also charged an extra $5 fee to change my payment date to a date more convenient for me.  They charge you fees for anything you need to do.I tried make a call and was informed that my phone was disconnected due to non payment although I just paid.  I called the Metro PCS customer service to resolve this and cant get anything except a recorded loop.  So my money has been sucked into a Metro PCS vortex with no hope of recovering it.They have my $40.  They have an additional $5.  I have no phone service and I have no way to reach anyone at the company to fix this.On top of this,  on the first day I got the phone -- they allocated my $40 to SOMEBODY ELSE's account !!!!  I spent days trying to get Metro PCS to put the money back into MY account.As far as I am concerned, this company is a total scam.  Do yourself a huge favor and sign up with a different cell phone company.  Metro PCS steals your money and Metro PCS gives you no recourse if you have a problem.AVOID METRO PCS AT ALL COSTS !!!!!", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Telefono desbloqueado", "Author": "Osay", "ReviewID": "R1O8CKYQNU1RI1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "En la publicacion no especifica si el telefono es desbloqueado, si la venta comprende los accesorios tales como cargador, audifonos, memoria externa, etc.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "3G-enabled BlackBerry smartphone with full QWERTY keyboard and touch-sensitive optical trackpad\nEnjoy talk-all-you-want service with no annual contracts via affordable, flexible MetroPCS rate plans\n2-megapixel camera/camcorder; Bluetooth stereo music; microSD memory expansion; digital audio player\nUp to 4.5 hours of talk time, up to 252 hours (10.5 days) of standby time; released in November, 2009\nWhat's in the Box: handset, rechargeable battery, charger, USB cable, BlackBerry software CD, quick start guide", "Name": "BlackBerry 8530 Prepaid Phone (MetroPCS)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WNT6cYJ6L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003ZWH0NU"}}
