Everything works as advertised. One feature that impressed me was WiFi. Could send emails from phone over my regular internet connection and ISP. Did not deduct any time as I was not using TracPhone's airwaves. If you have trouble with WiFi and email, go through the Advanced Setup menu's until you find Port # for incoming email and Port # for outgoing email. Also check your security mode for SSL, authentication required, etc. I had about given up on emailing until I found that all the default Ports were wrong for my ISP/email connection as well as authentication. Put in same Port #'s/authentication as present email uses and worked perfectly.The Bluetooth paired with my TomTom GPS and worked perfectly for hands-free communications.Texting worked great at 0.3 minutes deducted - send 3 of these for price of one phone call. Also inserted a jpg photo. Worked well between phones. Downloaded them from computer to phone via the included cable. Sent text message to relative with 'dumb' phone from another company I guess. He said he received the text but couldn't reply by text as would have to add 'data' to his plan.Browser also worked great on websites.The manual doesn't mention it, but when entering Contacts, you can bring up the bigger keyboard by using the Menu in upper right-hand corner, after getting cursor in the entry box. Tap on Input Method, then Keyboard.Got two of'em (White for wife, Black for me). No problem transferring phone number and one year of paid-up service plus about ten hours time remaining to this phone.

The keyboard in this phone is really great; wider spaced keys (on the android keybd) and much less 'touchy' than the 800g was.  Now it is a pleasure to text again.  I also like the feature to shut off the 'phone lock' if I wish to and I use that a lot; being home most days there is no need for me to have the phone constantly lock up.  Volume on this phone is very good as I have some hearing loss and many phones I've tried I just could not get them loud enough.  The touchscreen is smooth with no glitches and scrolling (as thru contacts) is a breeze with this phone.  One problem I am having is a friend sent me 3 photos I want to save (to my sd card) and when I call up the photo, there is no option to save it that I have found.  Will have to work on that I guess.  My main complaint and the reason for 4 stars is that I cannot use the wifi on this phone.  I have a Netgear router and went to their site to verify my password; but the only way I can connect this phone to my wifi is to choose \"WAP\" on Netgear's site.  And then, I cannot use my notebook or my tablet, because they are currently under a stronger security setting.  From what I have seen (and might be wrong here), the WAP setting is a very weak security setting and not recommended.  I bought this phone specifically because it had wifi and would save me some minutes when I'm at home, but I cannot connect to it.  Other than the wifi, I think it is a pretty stable phone.UPDATE: 7/30/13 - I felt I had to add one additional feature of this phone (LG840G) at this time and that is the virtual qwerty keyboard is only available while you are texting. It will not come up while searching online or at any other time that I have found (even though I have it set for default).  For me, this was a big disappointment because I've never had a phone that operates like this.  I love the qwerty keyboard and simply cannot stand using the std number keypad.

This person just needs a little seminar on the workings of it all.... Thank you...HOW NOW, BROWN COW?.... Your moniker is confused as you are. I am here to defend the error of your negative post of TracFone. I have used this company for 3 years since Verizon became non-negotiable. TracFone has been nothing but superb, but one needs to know how to apply their business plan. It says very clearly in the directions \"not\" to buy a double minutes card for the triple minute plan on the LG840G... You are directed to buy the regular minutes; then they will triple automatically. I just did this yesterday with my new Lg840G; everything went very smoothly, but then I read the directions as suggested prior to activation and addition of minutes. My old minutes transferred from the other phone, and the new minutes were tripled automatically. It is unfortunate that the company gets a 1 star just from a misunderstanding... 3 Years and many transactions, TracFone has been excellent. I do everything on the net instead of talking with someone from Guatemala...But they are very helpful for those who need it... I wish you could retract your negative commentary...

This is not really a bad thing as tracfone buys mins from the major companies and resells them to be used on their phones. You can get tracfone mins from many location to refill as needed, but just remember tho the mins carry over, they do have an expiration date... if you don't add more mins before the expiration you loose all.How it works;  You put mins on the phone, txt messgs are 1/3 mins , pic messgs about 1/2 min (depends on size), and talk is per min. The nice part of this phone is 3x mins for life... put on 100 and get 300mins..Also a big plus is WIFI for email and browsing DOESN'T use mins at allSecond, I don't use a phone alot, maybe 20-30 mins a month and about 100 texts to stay in touch with the kids... This phone fits my bill just perfectly... I dropped my old phone and use this and cut my cell bill in half.Third, you have to find out ( ask friends ) what cell companies work best in your area... The \"G\" ending of model shows it's a GSM phone. In my area that means T-mobile or AT&T; as the carrier. Tho both will work,one may work better for coverage!***Tip... is the model number on the package ends with \"P4\" it's an AT&T;, if a \"P5\" its T-MOBILE.***As to the phone;  It's a HALF-SMART phone.. Unlike most most smart phones ( android, apple,etc ) this phone runs on JAVA OS... it will only run JAR apps of which ( other than games ) there are few and they tend not to be tested/inspected like from the major app stores, so be careful what you add if you do.This wasn't a problem for me as the phone comes with the major apps most need ; wifi/mp3/email/browser(not the greatest)/BT in both a2dp and hst for music and phone/cam or video/etc.So for me it works well, the apps provided are fine for basic needs..

Operation of the phone is a little funky but okay. For existing Tracfone customers beware of Tracfone Technical Support transferring minutes/phone number from your previous Tracfone phone. My wife and I purchased new Tracfone phones but Tracfone Technical Support did not transfer the minutes we had on our old phones. Still fighting with Tracfone to restore approximately 1200 minutes on my phone and approximately 1600 minutes on my wife's phone. Suggestion to avoid losing minutes with Tracfone: When you purchase another Tracfone phone that you obtain a new phone number on your new phone and just use the minutes that came with your new phone. Keep your old phone active until you use all the minutes you have on it, once used up you can then deactivate your old phone if you wish to. I know this is possibly a bit of a hassle for you to have another cell phone telephone number, but this can avoid losing minutes (money) and the aggravation of dealing with Tracfone Technical Support. I'll post another update on how my fight went with Tracfone.  I already have a total of  over 6 hours on the phone with Tracfone trying to restore minutes/phone number to my current Tracfone phones, both cell phones have been out of service for the past 5 days.  I do recommend this phone, but one must keep it as simple as possible when dealing with Tracfone in order to be not ripped off!Update: After a couple of more hours on the phone with a Tracfone Technical Support Supervisor all the minutes were returned to my phones. What a hassel this whole process was! Keep it simple with Tracfone and you will be quite happy with your inexpensive cell phone!", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "better than 800", "Author": "tom", "ReviewID": "R3DSZLGP46ZYDU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "except for no service in one area, a tracphone limitation, this is a great phone.  works as advertised.  easy to use.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG840G cell phone", "Author": "Robert W.

I just upgraded my LG800G to this model and I'm in love.  It is much easier to use than my last phone.  In fact, my 15 year old carries a tracfone slider and has asked to upgrade her phone to this one too.  I've already ordered hers.Some people say you get what you pay for and yes, the price is cheap.  But I've got to tell you, these cheap phones are worth it.  Tracfone covers all their phones with a 1 year warranty.  My last phone gave me troubles in month 10 of my warranty and I called tracfone to tell them about my problems.  They sent me a new phone a few days later, easy transfer and I mailed back the old phone in a prepaid envelope.  Before I switched to tracfone I had problems with my cell phone and my carrier would not cover it.  I would have had to buy a new phone, pay for a service contract if something happened to it in a year and a new contract for 2 years of cell service.  That was my clue to jump ship.For those who just want to know about the phone features I've got something for you too.  There is a web site that has an interactive tutorial you can walk through covering the features of this phone.  Check it out at [...] .  You won't be disappointed!!I bought my phone on eBay for 104.99.  It came with the phone with triple minutes, 400 minutes plus 365 days of service card and a gift card to restraunts of you choice for 10.00 through tracfone. It was listed at 109.99 but if you put it in cart then buy you save 5.00.  This is a DEAL folks!!  Get 250 bonus minutes with code 70479 when you load your card.

Occasional phone calls too but it's pretty rare.  After doing a lot of research over a week or so I am so glad I discovered Tracfone and this model in particular.  Like I said, this was not going to be used much.  Paying a monthly fee to add another phone to our family plan was still overkill for what we needed.  Again, this is perfect.  It's a modern design so it's not 'embarassing' to use but it is FAR from actually being a smart phone.  It may have the 'look' but it's not.  But it does what it needs to very well.The touch screen is responsive enough, but not in the iPhone class for response.  So don't expect that.  The screen resolution is quite low, again don't expect iPhone quality there either.  It's got a good phone book and you can add contact icons with a person's picture right on one of your home pages.  So for my daughter's I put her top 6 family contacts right on her home screen for easy dialing.  But again, there is a phone book too which works just fine.  Phone can be set to ring or vibrate.  You can easily add MP3 ring and SMS tones just by connecting the USB cable to your computer and dragging them onto the phone.  We just made our own with a sound editor program.  Keep in mind that the files need to be below a certain file size in order to show the option to make a MP3 file a ring tone once it is on the phone.  If you add something and you can play it on the phone using the music player but it does NOT give you the option to make it a ring tone, odds are the file is just too large.  Cut it down smaller with a sound editor program and try again until it works.Text messaging works fine and I like that fact that you can see if you have new messages by just hitting the button to get to the lock screen and you can see if you have any without actually unlocking the phone.  The phone has a low battery 'beep' which goes off every 3 minutes when it gets down to a critical level.  To me this is a good thing because the phone can go several days without charging and it tough to remember to charge it.  Not sure if it can be disabled.  I'm sure eventually it's going to wake me up in the middle of the night so we'll see.  We got her a nice 'hybrid' case on Amazon as well as a screen protector and I'd say it's really well protected now.  I didn't want a phone that was the end of the world if it got broken and since Tracfone's are so inexpensive to replace I don't need to worry OR put a lot of pressure on a child to protect an expensive device.  Keep in mind that there are a 'few' Tracfone models that actually include a bundle of minutes that don't expire for a whole year and still have triple minutes (hint hint) so look around and consider these models - you'll be very happy if you do.Final thought - my wife had a fit when I said I thought a Tracfone was the best solution for our child.  I think there is a stigma about Tracfones being junky and having very limited coverage areas (not true but depends where you live of course).  I believe this model uses AT&T; where we live and that is what our contract phones use so we see little to no difference in coverage.  Now that we have had the 840g for a couple weeks my wife agrees that this was a fantastic purchase and the best solution for our needs. Highly recommended.

Its not perfect- its got some issues, but most can be worked around.Basics: The phone arrived on time and I had absolutely no problem activating it via the tracfone website which I highly recommend using.  Also be sure to google tracfone \"free minutes\", as there are some promos that are regularly offered by tracfone to supplement the airtime you will be buying.  I bookmarked the pages with these codes because it appears they are always available.(Short background) This review is coming from someone who has owned quite a few cell phones for both business and private use and I've bought some as gifts.  I needed a couple backup phones in my household and I recently picked up one of these for myself (two more as gifts) and also an LG 505c tracfone.  I run my household from my no-contract Samsung Galaxy S2 from Virgin Mobile (love VM-been with them for years) and before that a Blackberry- justifying the cost by cancelling my landline.  I have a great many good things to say about this phone but it could never be my one and only phone.  Some reasons I've listed below.Aesthetics:  It does NOT look and feel like a cheap phone.  Its very solid, nice looking, slim enough and has a good combination of gloss and texture.  A relative actually picked it up accidentally to leave my house then realized it wasn't hers: she owns a white i-phone.Functions: Yes, you can look at your e-mail from it - the built-in widget proved very unreliable though, repeatedly telling me it failed to send my email, even with wifi on- and it outright ignored attachments--but at the exact same time, when I logged into the same e-mail from the browser on the phone, it sent just fine and I was able to open the attachments when logging into email from the browser.  What I was not able to do at ALL so far is send a photo or video from e-mail.  The phone has the capacity to do so, but with no explanation reads it has \"failed\" to send and that I should try again.  Using the browser numerical keypad is annoying- so you can save your e-mail login page as a \"saved page\" and just enter your user name or password to look at your mail.  But then good luck replying to any e-mail with that crazy keypad.  Perhaps there is a cut and paste solution if you must use this tiny phone to write emails.  There is a qwerty via the phones built in e-mail \"app\" but like I said, it often just doesn't feel like sending mail and sending-receiving from the phone's browser via wifi ALWAYS worked.  Opera mini is unreasonably small to type out emails on unless you know how to make a stylus out of a toothpick and the right kind of rubber.  I tried the tip of a rubber band (ha ha ha) and it didn't work.  And there is absolutely no security on this phone.  There isn't even a lock code so you can leave it laying on your desk charging etc.  There is 'one' lock function if you are in a pinch - but it requires you to reset it every single time your screen goes dark - which is ridiculous.  Also -it doesn't really work- press enough buttons and the \"lock\" just mysteriously goes away- weird.  Just the prospect of throwing it in my purse or pocket without a lock code makes me nervous I might automatically dial someone. (See my solution* below).  Is this a tracfone ploy to squeeze out more minutes?  I don't know, but my extra bargain phones of the past had codes, oh and notification lights!  There isn't one of those either.Bottom line: seriously, for 29 bucks- this phone is pretty amazing.  I think its the only bargain phone I know of that lets you surf wifi - no, there is no real app store, that's true - but having wifi opens up a lot of possibilities - and you can always pick up a \"Kyocera Event\" from Virgin Mobile for $40 bucks )don't activate it and do your mobile banking-do voice activated browsing-goof off at the play store with Ice Cream Sandwich 4.1 to your hearts content - watch hulu and netflix, almost everything--without getting involved in data plan pricing--anyway back to this little gem.People say I sound \"fine\" but a just little more tinny than my regular cell.  And I have to say I'm impressed with the MP3 player- it sounded better than I expected (album art gets transferred as well as the music, it sorts by album, artist, song and makes playlists: no equalizer) and the video camera and camera aren't all that bad either.  Yes, they are low MP, and they will get grainier when you view the videos from a larger screen on a computer, but connecting this phone to my laptop via standard micro usb and sharing music, photos and videos was a snap (nothing funky there) and the outdoor movies I took in daylight looked pretty good -indoor photos: sorta okay during day, grainy in the evening.  There is no flash, of course, but just having that video camera in your pocket is so much better than nothing.  The pics and video are completely comparable to an average Blackberry experience.  Not too great- but in a pinch, nice to have. And you get both color and black and white which is nice-sepia too.  You can increase the brightness while taking a video or picture to compensate a bit for the lack of flash when indoors.  The images opened well with Quicktime, if that helps anyone out there.Yes, you can load a micro sd card into this phone ( I think its up to 32G) so it pays for itself several times over just as a reasonably sized MP3 player- you have to take off the back of the phone-its under the battery -but that's easy enough. It comes with a 2G card.Texting is pleasant enough on this phone since that is one of the few functions where the phone provides a touch qwerty.  Its a comfy sized qwerty - not too small or too big either.  But if you are a heavy texter, just know that for some reason the designers decided to use pretty large lettering overall, and so you can only see the titles- of THREE texts before needing to scroll down in your inbox.  The LG 505c, for example, is an even smaller phone but you can see much more info on one screen. There is no threaded texting.  Again, not practical for someone who has several contacts they text daily- although you CAN sort texts by contact once opened- so there's that.Yes, you can watch a teeny little screen of Youtube on this phone.  It is SMALL- like ONE INCH SQUARE! but it works, and fairly well, and its loud enough and clear enough )for example) for two people seated on a couch to giggle over funny videos.  I only tried it via wifi by the way.  And because this is not a smart phone and has no apps running etc. navigation around the web on wifi is pretty darn fast- which is really unusual on a cheap phone-actually it can be unusual on more expensive phones too.  Its not a really weird looking or dated mobile browser either. But again, it can't render all the pages - IE you can't actually look at HULU.  But you can do Google searches to find the info you need while out and about and you can use the web to check e-mails from several sources for example- which allows you to erase the browsing history and keep your e-mail private.Battery life is good- then again I'm used to battery hog phones so I'm biased.The screens are a little cartoonish - for the price, who cares, but while I'm reviewing it I might as well say - the icons are set on a baby blue background- which makes it easy to see, but it isn't exactly slick.  The LG 505c I ordered (also a serious bargain here on Amazon- refurbished)  has nice, black screens and classier icons - reminiscent of Android smartphones-but no wifi. Also the lettering is rather pixelated compared to the LG 505c which has really crisply defined print- this LG 840g has grainier lettering both on the screens and on the browser- the browser fonts remind me of the Blackberry browser I had several years ago if you are familiar with those.I installed \"Opera Mini\" but the keyboard is SO MICROscopic that I think even a stylus would keep hitting the wrong letters.  That's one of the only real bummers about this phone- the weird numeric touch keypad for certain web functions instead of a qwerty.  Very odd. Browsing can be time consuming unless you have your favorite-frequently used pages saved.One thing I highly recommend is before you click on \"browser\" on this particular phone, get in the habit of clicking on \"wifi\" first to see that you are still connected.  I go a step further and slide the wifi onto \"off\" for a few seconds and then onto \"on\" and on more than one occasion, the phone said it could not connect (I reset my router and that resolved it).  If the phone loses the connection to wifi for whatever reason, you WILL get charged for accessing the web- even if you quickly press buttons to exit.Also- you can e-mail yourself wallpapers from a PC or a cool wallpapers app from a friend's android (or family photos etc.) to put on this phone for free.  And no, you can't stream Pandora, but with Wifi, you can at least play songs and playlists and entertainment from Youtube for free - the headphone jack can plug into any stereo system with a 5 dollar audio cord purchase.Also- I bought these as gift for two people who have cars old enough to have cassette players above the cd players.  If your car has either this, or a jack for an MP3- this will turn your LG 840g into a car-wide stereo speakerphone controlled by your car's volume so that is really nice.  You just need to buy the little cassette tape converter (amazon sells them for 8 bucks and up I think).  You can listen to music via MP3 and answer the phone if it rings with the press of a button as the music goes off automatically.  Very nice and safe feature that works with most phones with mp3s.One odd surprise was the stock clock alarm- - instead of beeping it has this soothing morning mixture of birds chirping etc.- and whimsical graphics--though you can choose other sounds of course.There's a reasonable selection of pleasant ring tones- several I would describe as \"classy.\"inadvertent call solution:  *So I bought a squishy cover, under which I hid a thick slice of a wooden teriyaki stick on either side of the screen-on button at the top so you really have to dig your finger in to activate the touch screen- its working to prevent inadvertent calling so far.Well I hope that helps some of you out there considering this phone.  Remember- you can always buy an Android and not activate it if you want lots of access to apps or way better pocket-sized access to email - but this is the only phone I've come across that can offer talk, text, camera, and touch screen combined with video and wifi all on the same device for under $10 a month.

I saw this model for around 60 bucks, and it offered so much more than my old phone.  I decided to check on Amazon to see if I could find a better price and found it for only 32 dollars!  This white one was 8 dollars cheaper than the black colored model, which was still only 40 dollars.  Since I was going to put a silicon type case around it anyway, the color didn't matter.  So I bought the cheaper white one, and for 7 dollars more added the pretty case.When I received it a couple of days later I attempted to use Tracfone's website to transfer the minutes and service time from my old phone.  After entering all the information, the \"Is this ok\" final screen showed that it was only going to transfer 1100 of my 3300 minutes.  Good thing I read it completely and didn't answer ok.  So then I used my old phone to call them.  By using their phone tree system to transfer service I didn't have to enter any information other than just the S/N of my new phone.  I guess they got the information they needed right off of the old phone I was calling with.  Just a short time later 'all' my minutes and service time was transferred over to the new phone.NOTE--You have to completely turn off the new phone to activate it after the old one says \"No Service\".  Just pressing the off button leaves it in standby mode, which isn't really turned off.  I had to press and hold the off button until it turned off completely, and then it activated when I turned it back on.I really like that it can connect to the web via Wi-Fi.  I've been able to download lots of ringtones for it without using even one of my minutes.

That took a few days and some computer work, not for the faint-hearted.As a phone this deserves 2-3 stars the most.  Voice quality is OK but I need to use the speaker phone to hear because it's not loud enough.There is a feature called International Calling for no extra charge.  First I need to dial an 800 number, wait for the prompt, for English press 1, then enter the long-long international phone #.  If I slow down for 2 seconds it hangs up and I need to restart again.  Very poor setup.  There are ways on the website to pre-program the international numbers, but it wouldn't recognize the serial number or the IME number, so I couldn't set this up.  I think they offer it as a gimmick, but they don't want that we use it.For anyone planning  to use this for e mail or Internet, here is my take: \"YOU MUST BE KIDDING.\"This is not a smartphone. It's great to keep in the car for emergency use, for calling someone while on vacation, but if you depend on your phone and use it a lot, look elsewhere.  Text and numbers input is clumsy, you'll need a password to listen to voice mail, the screen goes dark after 60 seconds and you will be poking around a dark phone to get the speaker phone back, and so fort.I can live with it because we don't like cell phones much, but again, for a heavy user, this isn't a good choice.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shopcelldeals Team Rocks", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"fountainpen\"", "ReviewID": "R3HRQXEMMXRBYU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I truly enjoyed doing business with the Shopcelldeals' team.

Only negative I can say it's too easy to type and send text messages now so we really have to watch my daughter so she doesn't blow thru her minutes :-( She did start w/a flip phone but only had that since June (she had to be more cool like her friends and get this phone)  I will be buying one now too as I checked her's out first and LOVE it!!

I don't need all that and the crazy expensive monthly bill.....  We also used the wireless option with our aircard a few times already and it didn't use any of our minutes :-)  We did have to wait almost a day for our old minutes/days to be transferred from the old phone but that just meant carrying both phones that first day (it beeps at you so you know it did it).

Again a word of warning though this is a prepaid cellphone and while it does have some decent capabilities it obviously isn't going to match up to a Samsung Galaxy and the like so if you want those bells and whistles you should just get a contract cellphone instead.The cellphone is pretty sturdy about the same as the LG800g and could probably handle a drop relatively safely(Though mine got stepped on by a heavyset person before I could pick it up again)but you can get a protective cover pretty cheap here as well if it makes you feel safer.So again for those who have needed a phone in a dire or problematic situation here's a very affordable one to get without the hassle of signing up for a yearly contract and worrying about monthly costs or early cancellation fees but also remember if you're one of those need to have the latest model to keep with the fashion crowd then obviously this phone isn't going to be for you.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "good choice", "Author": "Jerome P Dean", "ReviewID": "R1JV7T8NLK4NXD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "not a smart phone but a good choice if all you need is a easy to use phone this is the one", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "its ok", "Author": "Mrs.Gregoire", "ReviewID": "R2CJQMG2BW924K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My dauther love the phone.but it is very slow on internet and other things but its a nice phone for her.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice phone", "Author": "Deb S.", "ReviewID": "R2V76TY3O50JAM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really nice phone, folks.

The triple minutes is a great bargain and it's also great that this phone holds a charge for a much longer time than any android I've had in the past. The white is a refreshing color choice and I immediately purchased a screen protector and white silicone case to keep it looking brand new. The phone can get online with the wifi feature without burning up the minutes and takes decent photos that can easily be uploaded, texted or emailed. In my opinion, this is a choice of phone that is attractive, highly functional and reasonably priced to purchase and operate.

The touchscreen is great especially when you have been accustomed to a flip phone. Calling is easy whether dialing the number or choosing from one of your saved contacts.This LG840G also shuts down when not in use so you save battery life. I only charged this phone for a short time when I received it. For those who only want a phone (and/or a camera for those moments you want to capture with family and friends), this is the one to get. You can go online or call a Tracfone representative to transfer your current Tracfone minutes & phone #.What sold me was the reviews for this phone. With the many features included--Bluetooth, email, games, camera & video, music player, etc. you get so much for the money. With a price point less than $40.00 with free S&H; from a great seller on Amazon this made the choice even more attractive!Tracfone. No monthly billing, no \"extras or frills\" you may not want or need. A wise choice for yourself as a first time cell phone purchaser, an upgrade from a flip phone or for someone as a gift.

Tracfone has more control over their phones than what they would readily reveal, but it's hardly worth the time involved in getting everything corrected when I would never consider using it in place of an Android anyway.  The 840's Web browser is very basic.LG also made an attempt to provide a suitable clipboard memory in this 840, but unfortunately that fell short of expectations as well, so it's one and only success remains in its Bluetooth provision that received some improvement over its LG800G predecessor. Bluetooth remains as its one shining ability other than being a truly reliable text/voice phone that is made even less costly by allowing triple minutes.We can hope that the successor of this phone will be better provisioned and include reliable components, so if not yet decided about this phone, then I would suggest passing this one up for now in favor of the much more extensive and rewarding abilities provided in a variety of other smartphones that sell for about the same price as this mere toy.UPDATE:  July 29, 2013I made corrections above regarding this smartphone and should also state that a fair appraisal of this little phone would also include some features I neglected to cover previously. In fact it has a couple more rather welcome and significant improvements over its LG800G predecessor, the first being its ability to be connected to a PC as a mass storage device. This allows data files, videos, music, pics, etc. to be copied or moved from your PC directly to the phone's internal memory so they can be viewed, played, or sent by this phone. Secondly, it shows a superb ability to play recorded movies or video and sound podcasts and mp3 music.

The tracfone automated system is very poor in customer satisfaction, and if you have any issues, good luck contacting someone who isn't just reading off a script, and could care less about if you are happy. I now have two phones, and the replacement was even worse than this. Beware before buying this phone unless you live in a urban or fairly suburban area. When the phone did work, however, the keyboard was very small on screen, and there was no auto correct, half of the times I could not even get it sideways, I was punching on screen numeric keys corresponding to letters. There is no automatic orientation. And data is absurdly expensive, even on the limited tracfone browser, posting a picture to Facebook uses 8 minutes!

Plus Tracfone gives you the opportunity to be billed monthly depending on your needs or pay up front, and gave me triple minutes as a bonus for the lifetime of the phone.  It's a win -- win scenario.  I chose paying upfront because the various time amounts were really affordable, especially going through Amazon.com  One of the last reasons, is that you can travel abroad and not have to worry about connections.  As I get more savy about this phone and want to upgrade, no problem there are more models with more options to choose from. And you get to keep your old number if you so chose.

I have big hands and fingers and it takes 1.5X as many keystrokes to enter a text message. It's bad in the numeric mode, and even worse in the \"full\" text version. Worse than a nuisance.  I would probably have been happier with a slideout model.(3) This is a Java phone for those who know what that is.(4) When I used the CSV import, it didn't go well. Most of the imports ended up with no name. A lot of the data was ingested, but it didn't line up well with the contact fields used in the phone. (I was importing maybe 600 contacts from a 3 year old Droid)(5) Indeed, in wifi mode, you can browse without using minutes, though the built-in browser is a far cry from Opera Mini. You can put Opera Mini on this thing, but it's a significant effort.(6) 3G performance in our 3G-only neighborhood is just fine (via AT&T; in this case) - but YMMV.(7) I like how it handles text messages. You can ignore them; you only pay when you read one.(8) Use only for emergency browsing, otherwise the $ you're saving over a good voice/data plan like the one we have with Sprint for our smart phones will be sacrificed to pay for data transfers. TracFone IMHO hasn't figured out how to compete with the \"full\" plans from the majors with smartphones -- even at the low end. When they do, I'll be one of the first to try it, but not with an old version of the Droid OS.(9) It's sturdy and quite slim compared to my old Galaxy; easy to keep in a pocket now without bulging rudely.(10) I will eventually wish it did 4G, as 4G is all around us in other 'burbs and Manhattan.(11) I was tempted by the new low end TracFone Droid, but my guess is that that choice will present an awkward combination for the pay-as-you-go ethic of a TracFone. A smartphone wants to connect to servers, even when you don't want it to, and you'll be paying for that.(12) I did add these accessories: USB charger/adapter cable (LG makes their own silly form factor - Shame on you!), a spare battery, a few extra covers, memory card (max that puppy out), and a plastic slip-on case. These were all from Amazon, and all recommended in other posts here.The true cost of the phone includes that \"tail\" of needed accessories.(13) I haven't tried using it for music playback yet, but the card allows you to put quite a lot on it.Conclusion: You can afford to lose or upgrade this phone without agonizing over the decision.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT FIRST PHONE FOR TWEEN GIRL", "Author": "Trishnmom", "ReviewID": "RIMPF4S67CGI0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was able to take my SAFELINK minutes (250 FREE) that I get per month & transfer them to THIS PHONE!!!

I called them about it twice they refuse to reimburse me the $30 worth of minutes I purchased in the last month. I used maybe ten minutes and the rest just kept draining from my phone. I feel like I am in the Twilight Zone with this problem and tracfone refuses to acknowledge a problem with their computer system or anything. There must be some kind of virus that is programmed to steal minutes from certain phones because my mom and husband are not having this problem. When I googled it, I found out that other people are experiencing the same situation though, so something is going on in that company. I have lost all my faith and trust in them. Their employees are the worst! They keep passing you on to another \"manager\" who does not help you at all. What exactly happened to over 500 of my minutes, I doubt I will ever find out. I currently my phone has no minutes and I purchased them three days ago and did not use even one. I will not buy any more. I am going to contact my credit card company to see if they can help me get my money back and unfortunately, I guess I,will have to buy another phone from another provider.

The camera, too, is not as powerful as the much more expensive phones out there.  But that's not why I bought this phone.

But I want to \"give back\" by placing my review here.  Have been a Tracfone user for over 10  years without any problems-- as long as you don't have need to contact customer services. However, I have to say that the customer experience for activating this phone was OK.  LG840g is a GSM phone, and I was replacing an eight-year-old CDMA Tracfone with lots of remaining units.  Did not even attempt to activate and transfer via the website.  Took over 1.5 hours with Tracfone customer service (using landline), dozens of entry of codes on new phone, start/restart phone, minor discussion (resolved to my satisfaction) over why all and not just half of my old minutes should be transferred, and I satisfactorily had phone activated with old phone#, and Tracfone service & minutes all transferred.This phone has WiFi capability (surf without burning minutes), built-in browser, email downloads via 3G to phone (or, you can read emails via browser). Touchscreen & swipe sensitivity takes a bit getting used to.  QWERTY keyboard available only for text messaging and for entering URL with built-in browser; all other text entry while browsing uses the clumsy old tap-tap-tap telephone-style dial keypad).  I had no problems downloading a second browser (using built-in browser),Opera Mini 7 (suggest you find the version that is \"registered\" with virtual keypad eliminated), which does have a pretty nice albeit small QWERTY keyboard for text entry on web.  I also used standard browser to download and install NeoReader (select LG505, no option for LG840 as of this writing) for reading QR codes.  Both applications will end up under \"Games & Apps\".  I have played with this phone for two weeks, have had no problems connecting to public WiFi at coffeeshops, clinics, library, and large shopping malls.  Takes a while to understand what the 3 \"hard keys\" at bottom of phone screen are supposed to do (from left to right, they usually mean \"SEND\", \"RETURN\", \"END\" for the current screen's content). Setting up your email accounts to download to phone may take some searching & experimentation, especially with imap Gmail;  Yahoo (free) was relatively simple with the \"push on\" option.Cell reception, historically poor inside my house, is a bit better with my LG840g, with number of bars fluctuating  from 2 to 4.  Voice quality appears to be as good as my old Tracfone , if not better (persons I've called say the voice quality sounds good to them).  The sim card I received activated on the AT&T; network -- not sure if all Tracfone LG840's will do so.  In areas where AT&T; phones typically get 5-bar signal strength, my LG840g can fluctuate wildly from 3 to 5 but hovering closer to 5-- but I've yet to have trouble with sending/receiving while in these typically 5-bar areas.  Email downloads are pretty fast with 3G.My cell phone is usually turned \"off\", as it's for emergencies, dialing \"out\" only, and meeting up with friends & family.  It's easy to burn up minutes so.... I keep email push \"off\"(I think push \"on\" allows phone to dial out sporadically to check for new messages) till you want to download emails. Have yet to figure out how Tracfone charges for web browsing and download of data (LG840g may differ from other Tracfone's standard 0.5 cents per minute of connect).  Text messages cost .3 minutes to send or receive, per my own tests.  My fingers are not large, but I have a hard time hitting the correct key on the QWERTY keyboard (a  stylus helps a little).  I keep WiFi turned \"off\" unless needed, to save battery life, use bookmarks to quickly access favorite websites via browser (when going over 3G).  This is a phone, with its teeny screen,  some web pages do not load properly and can be difficult to read even if they load.  Oh yeah... I'm happy that standard browser allows viewing of  YouTube videos -- though viewing are is really tiny, tiny.  My only \"complaint\" so far is that the talk time on my old phone was days and stand-by was weeks and this phone is rated about 3.5  talk time and 10 hours standby.  On the other hand, since I keep this phone stays \"off\" a lot of the time, why should I be complaining?Overall, the LG80g has been a fun upgrade over the old Tracfone candybar Nokia.  Hope it lasts as long.Phone is a bit slippery to hold, so I bought one of those jelly skins for LG840g from an Amazon vendor for around 2 bucks, shipping included-- works great, all openings exactly where they should be, and on/off button is easier to use.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very limited apps", "Author": "Printed Page \"Printed Page\"", "ReviewID": "R1STFDYSO0WZRA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If all you need is a phone with an easy interface, this is a great value.

Even better than wal-mart!!  I have only spent $70.00 total for  the phone and minutes and that is all I have to pay for 90 days.  When I top up again I can just do $30 for then next 90 days.  Plus it has WiFi.  With the WiFi turned on and I am home or anywhere with WiFi I can surf the web and it does not go against my minutes.  I could not be happier!!

The touchscreen is responsive.  The triple minutes is a great bonus.The browser defaults to Tracfone site, to type in a new web address the qwerty keyboard doesn't pop up, instead it is alpha-numeric like old-school texting, which is a pain.  It does have a qwerty keyboard that appears for texting.  It would useful and more logical to have this keyboard for the browser as well.  There is another quirk.  The dial pad disappears once you dial and if you need it to, say \"press 1 for English\", you must push another button to get the dial pad back up; an annoying, extra step.The accompanying instructions are not very detailed, many of the features must be figured out on your own.  I have only owned it a couple weeks and have not had time to do further searching on the Internet to see if perhaps more specifics of the phone are available.As a phone I would recommend it, as a tool to surf the Web, not so much.It would be nice if Tracfone would introduce a smart phone.

Time-consuming customer support.", "Author": "Wen C.", "ReviewID": "RJW7C7U56BQF9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "A friend of mine recommended Tracfone, so I purchased one for my kids thinking it is affordable and should be easy to manage. We had to call for a new SIM card. It took the staff more than 30 minutes just to enter my ticket. I'd heard buyers complaining about this process so, it did not come as a surprice. After I finally activated my phone, I went to Tracfone website and found this gorgeous Family Value Plan ($9.99 only for 50 minutes every month for the primary phone, then $5.99 for each additional phone.) I was very excited about it and purchased two more phones for my husband and myself, thinking that I can add them to the Family Value plan when I received them.My nightmare began soon after I received my two other phones. First of all, I had to call for new SIM cards for them. I endured the 30 minutes TIMES two for the staff to create two separate tickets for me and he was pretty new in his job. After I received my SIM cards, activated my two new phones, and added them to my account, the website did not let me add them to the family plan my first phone was in. I tried and tried to figure out a way to do it online so I don't have to call customer services but no matter what I clicked in my member account, it always led me back to Tracfone homepage and asked me to login to my account again. At this time, I was very frustrated. I reluctantly called the customer services and was transferred from staff to staff to fix the issue. Just when the last staff was creating my tickets, when I had already been on the phone for about an hour trying to get things resolved, I got disconnected and my account information was incomplete because she was still trying to fix it. I called the customer services again, and was transferred from staff to staff one more time until someone could create tickets for me. It took me another hour to finally had the two tickets created. My account view is still messed up but none of the staff could help me so I have given up explaining what's going on with it. I'll try requesting a ticket online myself because my neck is hurting from hours of waiting and talking to the staff on my home phone.Thank goodness I have a landline! All the waiting could have eaten up all the minutes on my cell phone. I have come to a realization that Tracfone is not a service you can solely rely on to meet your daily communication needs. Every text message costs you 30 cents (CORRECTION: .3 of one minute). You answered a phone and said \"Okay, see you at noon.\" one minute is deducted. Even if you're calling a 1-800 number, your minutes will still be deducted.. Before I purchased this phone, I was reading as many customer reviews as I could to find little catches like this but nobody said anything about it. If I knew this cell phone could eat up my minutes like crazy, I wouldn't have purchased them in the first place.  I should have tested the first phone a few more days before I switched phone plans. Now I'd rather stick with my old phone plan. Even though it's a bit more expensive, it's so much easier to handle than Tracfone services.My conclusions: The staff was okay. They were polite and genuinely wanting to help. Not all of them knew what to do in situations like this but eventually they transferred you to the right person. For each customer service phone call, expect to wait for at least 30 minutes to resolve your concerns. The member account page on the website is a joke. It's the worst design I've ever seen. You can't do anything it promised you that it would do. Every little thing you want, you need to pick up the phone and call Customer Services. I've talked to at least six of the staff members and none of them are native English speaker. Some of them are more knowledgeable and easier to understand than the others. The ticket system the staff was trying to use must be very bad as well because the poor staff would keep telling me they were looking up some information or waiting for a page to load every one minute during the entire 30-60 minute phone conversation. Tracfone really needs to upgrade their ticket system and website functions. If they have strong ticket system and website functions, they don't have to waste so much time on trying to fix customer issues.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is the second one that cratered within a month.", "Author": "Bruce A Jacobs", "ReviewID": "R1ZRZ9XY5QOZXT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't make a lot of calls but it is my only phone.

Since I already had a Tracfone this seemed to be a good solution in the mean time.I was pleasantly surprised by the intuitiveness of this phone's functions and the ease of transferring my old number, minutes & service to the new phone, which I did thru my online account. Being able to browse online using the WI-Fi capability without using minutes (as long as you have access to a network) is a big plus, and of course you still have the option to burn some minutes to browse if a network isn't available and you have a cell signal, which doesn't seem to be all that bad since Tracfone has some data to minutes formula rather than charging for the time you actually spend online. Another plus is this phone came with Triple Minutes For Life verses my old phone's Double Minutes For Life, adding more justification for the upgrade.As other folks have mentioned in their reviews, there are some compromises when it comes to the operating system, other software, & availability of the virtual keyboard, but I think there may be apps that can be added and tweaks to be sniffed out as workarounds for the encountered deficiencies, which I've yet to have the chance to fully explore.

The adds are misleading and if you buy something by mistake they won't give you a refund. I bought the 800 minutes card to go with this phone for $120. The phone says it will triple all minutes added. They would not triple the 800 minutes. For $160 I could have bought 1000 minutes that would have been tripled so it would really be stupid to buy 400 minutes for $120 wouldn't it. But that's really the whole point of this deal. It's to confuse the consumer and rip them off. I complained and they tell me that I really only bought 400 minutes and that was doubled to 800. They won't even upgrade to the 1000 minutes.
