I have been using WP 7 for sometime now. I just upgraded to Focus S. People talked about WP do not have enough apps? well.. may be for some people, but not so mcuh for me.. The phone is very solid easy to use. My sister uses Android. To me, they are great toy and fun. Practical and smart user interface? WP7 is very solid phone and has very smart interface. Focus S is probaly the best WP7 at this moment. Soon, Nokia 900 will be avaialbe with similler spec with cool Nokia Drive - GPS. Till the Nokia 900 is avaiallbe, Focus S is the one you should get...BTW: if you want to use 3G SIM, you will need to download wireless Manager from Samsung Zone from Marketplace and change APN setting to 3G, then you can still use 3G SIM, you do not need to get 4G SIM (ATT store told me that I need to get 4G SIM and give up 3G unlimited Data)", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stop Judging By Someday It Might", "Author": "Ron Lunsford", "ReviewID": "R3R1Z3BA1EOW1F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I keep reading reviews for devices that list \"lack of upgrades\" as a con... Well, if you purchase a car,you buy it for what it does right off the lot... not what it will do if... So, that said, what does the Focus S do and what doesn't it do?Overall: Great phone, amazing organizer, and edits Office on the go! I couldn't ask for more from my smartphone. I teamed a $300 Focus S with Red Pocket Mobile Service from Getsmartphones.Info and will never look back!Operating System: WP 7.5 is pretty stellar overall for calls and messaging. It doesn't have the skins that Android has, but it doesn't need them with the live tile home screen.Camera: The 8MP main camera does a great job in mid to normal lighting. It does struggle a bit in low light, but that is to be expected in even some of the nicer point and shoot models now. The 1.2MP front shooter is great for video chats and self portraits.Apps: Sure WP doesn't have as many Apps as Apple or Android, but have you looked at many of the titles? Many of the 500,000 A/A apps out there are just resounded versions of the same games. Sure, you like tower defense games - Apple has 50 types, Android the same, WP has 5... Multiply this by 50000 Apps, that will explain alot.Screen: This is a \"good and not so good\" rating. With black backgrounds, the SAMOLED screen is fantastic. But... when the background is white, it shows an almost blue color compared to standard LCD's.Battery life: My Focus S has 5 email accounts syncing every 30 minutes. I spend about 60 minutes a day on the phone. I send and receive about 100 texts a day... I also use the music player at the gym for about an hour a day and catch up on my web browsing when I can... the battery runs 15+ hours for me. That's about the bet of any modern generation smartphone I've had.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Focus SGH I937", "Author": "usubmariner", "ReviewID": "R2WQOB2MYNJ0PR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have purchased it for my wife a few months ago and would say that it has been an excellent phone in every aspect of its applications as well as user friendly with a very advanced interface.
