Truth.But the only time I opened the phone was to insert the 2 sims (different providers)So it does not matter at all. maybe even better as for the total weight.I bought this phone as I have lost my money with the previous one I purchased, which was the CECT Airphone 4.This LG is so much better then the CECT Airphone 4. Which was a disaster.Going to change my review on that one.The LG GX500 is 100% to my liking. The picture quality is ok, not moving objects. And with good lichting.The MP3 sound is exceptional good. The FM-Radio is perfect. I use 2 SIMS and it works flawlessly.Serving the internet is not as fast as on a PC (ofcourse) but is good enough for me to check my mail or need to google something. Not for extensive web serving of course. Maybe the more expensive models?The most important thing of course is the phone. The sound of both sims are perfect.And dialing is as it must be.I have not found one fault with this phone after using it for 6 weeks now. But again I have to say, with the experience I had with the Airphone 4, this is just so good.This time I took more time experimenting with the phone before posting a review. So it get the full 5 stars.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "LGX500 Good enough", "Author": "Rolando J. Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "R2R00XBMIBI5F4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the LGX500 because of its 2 simm capability, and it works just fine.. I was an Iphone user my self, so the touch screen sensibility is not something that will easely compare to an Ipone but it does the job, 2 sim are simultaniuo standby that means you can make a call with either Sim witouth any change of settings.It is a quad band on Sim1 but it is only TriBand on Sim2. (it worked fine for me as i have 1 850 and one 900 sim)Speed of the OS is fair overall except for the SMS menu where there is a lag when Deleteing messages it takes the phone about 1.5 secs to delete the message and get back to work. everything else is fine.. (agin it is not and Iphone on terms of speed)PC Connectivity is not as easy as you would expect, but once setup, it works fine and the interface is user friendly, and it let you hanlde all aspects of the phone, you can even send text messages out fron the pc software.. (nice)Over all good phone.. (I just wish apple would have a double sim iphone some day before teh end of the world)", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG GX 500", "Author": "Nur", "ReviewID": "RYST796YOYP5N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this mobile from amazon about a week ago. I like it. Delivery was good, less than a week.This is my first touch screen cell, but can not complain. It was kind a hard to make my mind between Samsung and LG, but finally I went with LG because of its battery (1500mA), very stylish design, price which is pretty reasonable and features like Wi-Fi and touch screen. But, of course the main plus of this cell is ability of 2 sim cards. I was using 2 cells for 2.5 years and got tired of it. It is really pain to carry 2 mobiles with you. But with my LG GX 500, this problem is solved out. 2 sim card ability works just fine: just define the primary and secondary sims and go ahead! I would definetly recommend this cell.Advantages: 2 sim cards, wi-fi,toch screen, long life battery, designDisadvantages: I can not find how to put a password lock when keyboard is locked.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "perfect traveler phone", "Author": "redman", "ReviewID": "RIULX4RV5U9ZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the phone due to constant traveling and having to buy a new cell phone in which ever country I found myself in.  What usually happens is by the time you learn to use said phone you leave the country.  So I thought I would give this a try.  Bought an international sim card and a local sim card of which ever country I am in.  So far I love it.  It serves its purpose dual sim your always have the option to call home and local sim so your local customers and contacts can get ahold of you.  Its not comparable with a smart phone if thats what your after but if your looking for a phone for a person on the go this is perfect.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone But...", "Author": "RJ", "ReviewID": "R2Y5FX1MKSCM5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "brought this phone recently, first i must say its very nice phone. but the wireless seem to give problems, connection keeps on failing, also some of the apps aren't responding, like the music and gallery apps. also i am having trouble finding this model on LG website. in the end the choice is yours..", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "I like it", "Author": "KKris", "ReviewID": "R3K2MNEVMRZ9Q1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I liked this cell phone.

I tried the Wi-Fi and it works pretty good. Phone came with software already updated to version 10 and the PC Suite software works just fine for me. If you use this phone a lot, get an extra battery. I don't use mine a lot and the battery lasts about 1 1/2 to 2 days. This is not a smart phone, but the menu looks pretty good, at least for an average user like me. Although some of the YouTube videos I've seen about this phone came with a stylus. Mine didn't, but then again, it's not on the description.

For what I use a phone for (I don't tend to browse the internet--I sometimes check my email or Facebook), it is more than sufficient.The Dual-SIM capability is amazing--you can set it to automatically switch between the two based on the incoming call or turn one off until you activate it once again.The screen is crisp and clear to look at for an extended period of time and touch capability is very sensitive for the most part.  Sometimes, it's a little difficult to get it to realize that you're trying to unlock it, but it's a minor annoyance.Sound quality during a call is clear and it picks up reception in classrooms that previous phones were unable to--it caught me off guard a few times in class.Battery life is surprisingly long--I only have to charge it every 4-5 days with my typical use (about an hour of texting and half hour of phone calls a day).The camera takes beautiful, clear pictures.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hard to use, touch screen not very responsive", "Author": "Bruce Fenton", "ReviewID": "R3O2UWYVWJSCTW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Decent phone & price but not very intuitive and a bit hard to use -- overall features decent and the dual sim is cool.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "EXCELENTE CELULAR", "Author": "SODAK", "ReviewID": "R2AU86P98BG8PF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EL LG GX 500 ES UN EXCELENTE DISPOSITIVO, ME GUSTA MUCHO PORQUE TIENE LA OPCI\u00d3N DE USAR 2 TARJETAS SIM A LA VEZ, EL MANEJO DEL TEL\u00c9FONO ES SENCILLO Y AMISTOSO, LA PANTALLA T\u00c1CTIL QUE POSEE RESPONDE R\u00c1PIDAMENTE AL TACTO, TODAS SUS FUNCIONES SON PR\u00c1CTICAS Y FACILES DE UTILIZAR.EL TAMA\u00d1O DEL TELEFONO ES TAMBI\u00c9N MUY BUENO, NO SIENDO NI TAN GRANDE NI TAN PEQUE\u00d1O.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "perfect for the price", "Author": "Marie Sonie Bossa", "ReviewID": "R244IKG61OYFS3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This smart telephone is wonderful.
