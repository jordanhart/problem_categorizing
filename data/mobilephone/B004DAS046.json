{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great battery life, sometimes a bit quirky.", "Author": "Bookworm2010", "ReviewID": "R1QULGK5D4OYGY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about a year and a half now; I bought it the day before I moved off to college because I needed a cell phone before I left. Getting used to this phone is a bit odd, since the talk/hold and the end/back buttons are backwards from most of the other phones out there, but after you have it for a few weeks this setup just becomes your new normal.The battery on this sucker is pretty great. Being a college student, I use my phone a lot for texting, pretty regularly (5x a week or so) for calling, and about 5 times a month I use the Navigation app. With the usage that mine gets, I need to charge it maybe once every 2-4 days, depending on how social I am and how often I use my phone.It is a bit quirky with the touchscreen sometimes; there are times when my brain moves faster than its brain does, and I have to wait a few seconds for it to catch up with me.  Sometimes this means that I accidentally cancel a message (you can go right back in and resend it), while others this means I accidentally check my email when I'm trying to check my text inbox.Since it is a touch (pressure) screen, I have had some accidental pocket dials or empty texts, but that's a user error factor that comes into play with whatever phone you get. Just remember to lock the screen when you're done, and it will be fine.There are some issues with it not sending/receiving text messages, but part of that is just the Sprint service (my sister has had both an Evo and a Google phone, and they both have had this problem too).  Super easy solution, just restart the phone and you will receive all of the texts that were being 'hidden;. It's easy to notice when this happens if you text regularly, because if you are unable to send one out, then you're unable to receive them too.I've had a Body Glove case on it for about 10 of the 16 months that I've had it, and having a decent case definitely makes life a bit easier, especially if you tend to drop your phone down a metal staircase, like I commonly do.Overall, this is a pretty good, sturdy little phone. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice touchscreen and qwerty phone.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone, but so-so touch screen.", "Author": "CramerDesign", "ReviewID": "R1F8072I7LZ2BD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a few of these phones from Sprint a couple years ago when I was up for a new contract.

It has the best keyboard to type on for large fingers (with 4 rows, the top row with just numerals), the email works amazingly well, texting is simple, fast, and 100% reliable, the battery life is an exceptionally long 7 hours on one charge (per Sprint, but over 8 hours per my own experience), the call quality is crystal-clear (both to the caller and to those on the other end), 3-way calls are a breeze, and the camera is excellent. In fact, no one ever knows I'm using the speaker phone, as that feature also sounds crystal-clear to those I'm speaking with (I used to ask the person on the other end how well I sounded, all the time, and they'd always say, \"perfect,\" whether I was using the speakerphone, blue-tooth, a headset, or via the normal earpiece/microphone!).This phone is highly reviewed on the Sprint website, by hundreds of customers (one of the reasons I first bought it)-- and most of the (few) poor reviews there (and on other websites) were from people who bought it USED--and then only \"Good\", yet they then somehow blame LG or the phone for its arriving in beat-up condition and things not working. Hey, folks, somebody sold you broken and damaged phones . . . and why would you ever buy a cell phone in less than \"New\" or \"Like-New\" condition, anyway?? (Many people really abuse their cell phones-- they use their phones in the rain and they drop them, and their kids break them . . . or does this not occur to you?)Anyway, ALL three of my Sprint LG Rumor Touch (LN510) phones work perfectly in all respects to this day. And I never would have opened and activated the 2nd and 3rd (which I did only to see that they worked fine upon purchase), because #1 is still working perfectly and even still LOOKS brand-new and shiny. Basically, for the main functions on a phone-- crystal-clear calling, texting, email, a great keyboard, and long battery life-- this phone simply does them better than other feature/basic phones, and better than most SMART phones, too (I've owned an i-Phone and two Androids). Calls on this phone are crystal clear; texting works perfectly-- always, both sending and receiving-- and the physical (QWERTY) keyboard has the best touch and most easily visible letters/numbers (in ANY light), plus has FOUR rows (the top one with just numerals); and the Internet, at 3G speed, works well, though not as fast as 4G.You also get the benefit of paying the lowest monthly fee on Sprint calling plans (and lowest monthly data fee), since it's a basic phone and not a smart phone. But, it does almost everything a smart phone does, almost always better, except efficiently running \"apps,\" many of which it cannot use at all. It DOES download music, ringers, and it streams video and music. I read the news (CBS, ABC, CNN, Yahoo!, etc.) on this phone daily. You can text to one person or CC up to 40 people at a time with one text. You receive \"whisper alerts\"-- one line of text, highlighted in white, when you receive a text message while you're on a call (you can turn off this feature, but why?), and the Call Waiting, 3-Way Calling, and Call Forwarding functions work perfectly and easily. The \"phone book\"--the Contacts--works perfectly--you press for a second to make a letter appear, and then can scroll IMMEDIATELY to the letter of the alphabet you need to look up your particular contact-- whereas even many smart phones today make you scroll through ALL of your hundreds of contacts, which would take forever. Not with this phone, this is far better.Speaking of contacts, this phone works perfectly with Sprint's \"Wireless Backup\" system, which let's you load 600 names, each with up to 6 phone numbers plus an email address. When you add, delete, or change an entry to your Contacts on this phone, it backs up, accurately, to Sprint's servers, within seconds, and then notifies you of such (you can turn off the notification feature). And you can go online to Sprint's Wireless Backup website to add, delete, or modify phone numbers and other info there; it then backs up those changes to your phone. Again, within 60 seconds, usually within 30 seconds-- and notifies you that it did. So, if you ever lose or break your phone, when you get another one, all of your contacts will load to the new one perfectly within a few minutes of activation. Oddly, all of Sprint's newer feature phones (ALL brands) do NOT have this feature, including the two that replaced this very model. But, this one, the LG Rumor Touch, has it. An invaluable feature. Why risk ever losing all your contacts when you don't have to?Brand-new, this phone comes with the battery, wall charger, a micro-SD card, a holder for the micro-SD card, an instruction manual, and plastic bag to return old phones for recycling if desired. This phone is FAR superior to its two successors, the LG Rumor Reflex and the LG Rumor Reflex S-- it has better-working email by far (works perfectly), FAR longer battery life, a better touch-screen, a FAR-better QWERTY [manual] keyboard, it's the only model of the three that 1) comes with a micro-SD card, and 2) works with Sprint's \"Wireless Backup\" of contacts. Oddly, the two successor phones have email functionality that is FAR inferior to use (email works illogically on those two--you actually have to BACK OUT of your Inbox to refresh it!?-- and it takes much more time to view or send an email; whereas all of that on THIS phone is smooth, logical, and fast). Oddly as well, many have complained on Sprint's website (about the other 2 phones) about something I noticed, too, on those two successor models: their keyboards are not visible under certain light--they're o.k. in bright light or darkness, but the letters/numbers are almost invisible at dusk. NOT a problem at all with THIS model, the Rumor Touch-- the physical keyboard is easily viewable (ALL keys) under ALL lighting conditions, as is the touch screen (though the touch screen, like all phone screens, is a challenge to view easily in bright sunlight).The phone's blue-tooth function works perfectly, and allows you to connect up to 8 or so different blue-tooth devices to it. And it has a headset jack for the use of a headset-- again, which makes the calls sound crystal clear to both you and to the person you're speaking with; I've tested this. Music sounds wonderful via headset as well.The only possible negative for this phone? Barely a negative: the touch screen, while very good, isn't as high-tech as those on much more expensive smart phones. It still works wonderfully and in no way seems cheap; but it's the only thing on this otherwise premier, luxurious phone that isn't truly luxurious. It's good, though!This is the BEST Sprint feature/non-smart phone ever! Excellent phone calls, emailing, and texting. Plus LONG battery life (7 hours talk on one charge, per the Sprint website and my own testing of it that gave over 8 hours talk on one charge). Also has excellent functionality in music, video, downloaded ringers, social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), and more.

Also shutting off and turning on your phone will help with text but it gets annoying.

It was my first cell phone and I was able to get it for about $10.00 with Sprint(mine was purple).  Through the time that I had the phone, I didn't upgrade it at all, so the technology was lagging compared to other Rumor Touches.  I loved the phone.  But I must say it's for people who don't want apps and sorely use it for texting and phone calls, as well as just checking your email and internet(if you have that plan).  It doesn't allow you to do a wide variaty of things, but it is an exceptional touch screen/texting phone(I recently got an HTC Evo 4G LTE).  The style and color is hip.  The camera was no where near the best, and it doesn't have a front camera, but this phone was made in 2010, I believe, and plus keypad phones don't usually have that.  It was durable and didn't break however many times I dropped it.  I recomend a screen protector and a case!

One of the many annoying features is that every time you go to touch something on the screen, the slider has reappeared, so you have to slide it out of the way before you can enter something. I was unable to find a way to delay the slider from appearing so fast, nor was the person at the Sprint store. (Both of us searched through all the menus.) The menus are annoying to use. You may know how, on an iPhone, a stroke of your finger slides the menu down until you find the item you want, which you then select. On this phone, stroking with your finger does nothing. You have to press down hard to move the menu. Usually, in the process, I end up selecting the item on which I press. I also got tired of pressing on the screen to make a bubble disappear, but it's still there, and I sometimes needed to press many times before the bubble finally disappeared.

At first I liked it because it was easy to text but now I can't wait to be rid of it.  The touch screen requires sliding your finger across the screen to unlock the phone before you can answer a call - then you have to press answer - by the time I do this, more often than not I have missed the call.  It also requires unlocking again before you can end the call.  Whenever you have menu choices, for example during voice mail or if you call a business, you have to unlock the phone to use the dial pad.  It becomes a real nuisance.  I thought there was a way around this that I just hadn't figured out so I took it to two Sprint stores and found the phone is just designed this way to prevent inadvertent touches from messing up calls.

I'm the type of person to not bother discussing this kind of stuff, but this phone, and my resulting 2 year nightmare relationship with it has changed me. I cannot allow others to share my fate.Let me begin by saying that this phone is unreliable in nearly every way. It fails to receive calls, the touchscreen will become unresponsive, and it will turn off at random times for absolutely no reason. This phone, being the little trickster it is, will often play a fun game in which it saves up all the text messages you receive, then given the to you all at once a week later! Fun!The image quality of the camera is great, as long as your into having photos that look like they were taken through a lens wrapped in a dirty condom.Never before have I seen such a shoddy display of modern technology. After you open the box you will be filled with a feeling of intense regret mixed with disgust for your terrible life decision in buying this phone. You will often wonder to yourself what type of insanity made make such a purchase. I soon learned that a special hell awaits for users of this phone. You will never be sure if that special someone is not responding to your text or if their missive has been pulled into the depths by the demon that is the LG Rumor Touch. Calls will be missed, alarms will fail to go off. Do not rely on this phone for anything, you will only be rewarded with failure and loss.On the upside, the case is sturdy. My phone has survived many accidental drops to the floor (aka my subconscious attempts to kill this phone).This phone comes with an instruction booklet, a charger, and a feeling of intense self-loathing for the lack of quality in ones life. Every time you take this phone out of your pocket a tiny part of you will die inside. You will grow to hate it more than anything else in your life. Please. Spare yourself. There is no need for you to go through my pain. Tying yourself to this phone for 17 months is lunacy. I can only tell you the overwhelming feeling of joy I felt when I ordered a new, different phone today. I have one weekend left with this pathetic excuse for a cellular device, and the days cannot go fast enough.I fully intend to take this phone to the range on monday, and see if I cant hit it to at least the 150 with my 9-iron.If you take anything from this long and convoluted review, it should be this: do not buy this phone. Dont.Do not buy this.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!If looking for an alternate product, I would point you in the direction of something more reliable.

If I leave it off the charger for more then one day, with talking on it less then an hour that day, it dies. The buttons were easy to push at first and then as time went by, the buttons won't work. Have a new text message or voicemail? Don't both touching the little bubble, because it won't work. Its like the phone registers you touching the phone, but in a different spot. I've tried reworking it and it still acts up.I don't know if this is just in certain spots or just the carrier or the phone, but my phone drops calls all the time.So if you want a phone to just talk on and text message, then this is your phone. If you want to do anything else, it's really not worth it. The internet on the phone sucks and the apps run horrible.
