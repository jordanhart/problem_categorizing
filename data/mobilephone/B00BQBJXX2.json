To use data u have to set a new APN (google it). Set up the new one and DISABLE! the old APN. Problem solved I have full bars and an H+. I have bin rock'n this thing for a month now and am happy with my purchase.  The screen is huge, the batterie lasts 8hours of heavy use  and is root able.  I am  using H20 mobil dispite their reviews and l have to say im impressed. Not only do I have filull bars in my basement but HSDPA as well .My favorite features of this phone are the hot spot, some camera features and obviously dual sim.Believe it or not the phone comes upgraded to jellybean 4.2.1 which is nice.It is a quadcore and my Antutu benchmark score was 13065, and it said the rear camera was 12mp! My device was damn close to the nexus 10 performance wise.If you are sceptical about this phone look up videos about it , the pros outweigh the cons. For the price u pay it is worth it. Any other brand name phone with this size HD screen is $400+  something to think about. Hope u enjoy whatever phone you chose! This one is a keeper in my book;)", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super awesome phone", "Author": "Kerry Brown", "ReviewID": "R1LZGDVV4KWLE9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Im not sure why people do not do more in depth reviews of stuff like this. Sometimes its like gambling...That said..Lets get started.The phone comes with 2 batteries, a screen protector, headphones, 800ma usb charger and usb cable, manual and s second back that has a flap attached to cover the screen.Supported freq: 900/1800/1900/850 gsm and 2000/1900/850/800 in wcdma  ..all this I have tested..Translated that means any att mvno generally will be able to use this phone to its full ability.Hsdpa and hspa+ both work, and since i am using att, i have been able to get 10mbps downloads out of this phone. Coming from a samsung note 2, internet access feels just as speedy as lte did..and as a data hog..its fine by me.Battery Life: So this is a weird one...it discharges so much slower then my note 2, and lasts about a day of actually using it like your supposed to be able to..In my case I stream music via bluetooth all day..and most of it is in the cloud..so its not local..so thats data transfer and bluetooth radios being used constantly. Top that off with a bluetooth data connection to my smartwatch and there you go... expect to be able to use it all day without charging. Note...I don't have any fancy live backgrounds or many other apps running, and the screen is generally fine on the auto brightness setting.Speed and such: I thought that since I broke my note 2 and didn't have 700 bucks for a new one, I would be hating my spoiled nature with these phones... This one exceeds my expectations as a nerd. Sure the anutu scores and such are lower then a note but it feels a bit more snappy. For example..to get a day of battery life out of my note 2 with the same sorta setup, ie music, bluetooth,etc..I had to use the power saver mode of the phone to make it almost happen, I don't have to do that with this one. It has a gig less ram, but again..I am not doing tons of things that require anything like that.Feel: It feels heavy...But at least I can feel it now.Screen: I love love love the screen..But I hate hate hate ..not that much but have noticed a \"blue\" tint to it, and it just seems to be the led backlight. I figured this out with a light meter and by playing with the flash. It too is a tad bit blue.. not a show stopper, but if you come from an amoled screen or something it will catch you.. But resolution wise..its awesome..for an under 250 phone... and its pretty bright.Sound: So the speaker on the back is loud..a tad \"tinny\" but again.. I like it more then my note 2..its a bit louder. Headphones sound great as well. I was worried about this, but it sounds great...Stuff it came with: So the case is ok..Hope to find a better one. The charger sucks..Invest is a 2 amp charger.. headphones are horrific...Almost as bad as having a tone deaf person sing you your favorite song....and the fact it came with a second battery is awesome..alto having an external charger would be of some use..I have retrofitted my note 2 external charger to work with the battery so I didn't have to find a new one. Screen protector is nothing special.. It works.....And the flip case is made of some super cheep material and its white ..and will break easy..but.. its a nice touch.Wifi: speedy and stable...seems to have better range then the note2, and it is b/g/n and connects in n mode at 135/135 mbpsBluetooth : I'm so so so happy I didn't have to do any hacks to make things work. pairing was easy, and I have had my headphones,watch,ipad connected at the same time with no issues at all..Range seems to be better, I have walked far away with my headphones and not lost a connection. Kudos..Annnd it comes with google's app store... soo..Ok now for the stuff for nerds and people that want to get everything out of the phone....Fun stuff.. So my data connection and network connection would die..I thought I had a bad phone but realized that this baseband might have a problem with fast roaming. Sure enough Disabling it with mobileuncle tools located in the app store took care of that. I also forced the phone to wcdma only to help..so far its been rock solid....SD cards....So I had a 64 gig sd card in my note 2, and naturally migrated it to this phone. Every place that sells the phone says 32 gigs max. Well I can tell you that it does work with 64 gig micro sd cards. At first it said the card was damaged..And that only ment that the phone does not support exfat, and that is what the card was formatted for. Simply copying off my files and formatting as fat 32 and copying them back will get you a working 64 gig sd card.Storage space and you....  This model has 4 gigs of storage, with only 1.8 left for you and I... That sucks....This phone has a root and I would hope you would at least root it for just this quick storage fix...Since the phone has no space..you can make your sd card the primary sd card for storing apps and such on by editing the void.fstab file(google is your friend) and replacing sdcard0 with sdcard1 and sdcard1 with sdcard0 ... reboot and all the sudden you have (insert your sdcardsizehere) amount of space!Camera:8mp, and actually it sorta sucks...in the wrong light...in good light its great.Front camera: 4mp , but of course it tries for 5mp like the rear tries for 13.boo.. so stick with 8mp and 4mp for shooting. I have googled the datasheets for the camera modules and that is there native resolution.Video: the rear camera rocks...full 1080p and clear as day... For some reason it shoots in the 3gp format...wish it was mp4.. but when set to \"fine\" , you can take some darn good video with it.Bug: Avrc commands work however the play button acts like a back button for some reason...I am sure it can be fixed...Gaming: Not a big gamer but I have ran modern combat 4 on it(after the sd card mod) and it runs great.. no lag and super responsive. I have also ran ppsspp(psp emulator) and it actually runs better ..might just be the gpu is a lil better then the mali400..who knowsAll in all ..worth it and hope this answer's lots of questions people may have..", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does not work on T-Mobile USA 3G/4G", "Author": "Js", "ReviewID": "RK79IXFLD3HS7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased the phone from hotglobal shop.

The screen is beautiful, the battery life superb (and it comes with 2!), super fast and responsive, camera takes great daylight pictures, the interface is very user friendly,comes with a battery cover to protect the screen,and is thin and lightweight.Let me also say, this is my third Android phone, previous phones being the HTC EVO on Sprint, and the HTC EVO 3D on Virgin Mobile. Those were great phones, but out of the box, this phone seemed to blow them away.I chose this phone because I wanted a \"phablet\". I watch a lot of video on my phone and also enjoy e-books. A standard smart phone is just a little too small for my middle-aged eyes, but I didn't want to be chained to a full size tablet. Had I unlimited funds, the Galaxy Note 2 would have been my first choice. But for the price, and it's specs, this phone comes damn close at a third the price.The first major disappointment was that Netflix would not play on my phone.  Netflix was a primary reason I opted for a large screen phone.  Netflix was pre-installed, but would not play. I removed the app and re-installed it, but still no go. Everything else on my phone works beautifully, but I am at a loss why Netflix does not play video. Unfortunately, there is no customer service to turn to. Nothing comes with the documentation, and a search on the web yields nothing. So you're on your own. I don't believe I have a defective hardware issue, because everything else on the phone works great.I was willing to live without Netflix because I liked the phone so much, but the deal breaker was data speed. Unfortunately, though it is listed as a 3G unlocked phone, you can only get 2G speeds on Tmobile and it's associated MVNO's. This sadly, I learned only after struggling on the phone with customer service and then going into a tmobile store for help. The seller should have made this very clear that it is not fully compatible with Tmobile's frequencies for 3G.I wanted Tmobile service because it offers the best plans for me, with up to 5 gb of data without throttling down to lower speeds. And the ability to tether. Other reviewers say this phone works great at 3G speeds with AT&T; and it's related MVNO's.  But I've read that they throttle the data down to 2G after 1.5 gigabytes, tethering is not allowed, and you are penalized with permanently reduced speeds if you go over your allotment.So, I'm packing up this phone and back it goes. It could be a great phone for you, but if you are on Tmobile, you're stuck with 2G. Do your homework on GSM,WCDMA, APNs,MVNO,HSPA, because you will be on your own without any customer support. By the way, if you do buy this phone, and you keep it, invest in a better charger.  The included charger is garbage and takes forever to charge the battery to 100% (I clocked 7 hours).", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "make sure you have the sim card in the right slot", "Author": "JFrank", "ReviewID": "RZOOTOLOYV9OJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this item as an emergency replacement to my wife's blu quattro she lost. She is very satisfied with it. The screen is huge but is easy to get used to. It came with android 4.2.1 installed and was significantly faster than her old blu quattro phone (even though the quattro is supposed to be faster on paper). When the Sim was initially installed, I accidentally installed it in the CDMA slot when our provider is GSM. Please pay close attention to the type of carrier you have. Overall the only complaint is the lack of protective cases for it. The phone itself looks and performs great.
