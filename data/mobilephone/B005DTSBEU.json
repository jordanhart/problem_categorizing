{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great value on Virgin Mobile and an excellent phone.", "Author": "S. Power", "ReviewID": "R38EVRI13UMA95", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If this phone came out a year ago, it would be among the top performing phones from any carrier on the market.  Its very fast Snapdragon processor, vivid 4.1\" touch screen, and rock-solid Android 2.2 performance were cutting edge 12 months ago.  I don't say that in a disparaging way, but rather want to show where this phone fits into the spectrum of available devices.  If you want the newest, best, phone, you'll still have to go to the contract carriers.That said, this phone does everything I need very well, and at $300 upfront and $25 a month for service, can't be beat.  It works even better than the Samsung Intercept that I replaced with it, and is reasonably priced.  $25 a month, compared to what plans cost on the contract carriers, and you'll make up the $300 upfront cost in about 6 months.  Brand new customers, may have to pay the $35 a month that they are changing their bottom plan to, but that is still a great deal ($35 a month for 300 minutes, unlimited web/text; $45 a month for 1200 minutes unlimited web/text; or $55 a month for unlimited everything).This is my second phone on Virgin Mobile, and it made me realize that a lot of the problems that I was attributing to the network were actually the fault of my Samsung Intercept.  This phone is more stable in every way.  Wifi, GPS, 3G, Voice, the touch screen, applications, everything about this phone works better and is more stable than they did on the Samsung.Beyond this comparison to my previous Virgin Mobile phone, here are a few comments about the phone:+ very thin and lightweight. I miss the physical keyboard of my Intercept, but only slightly.  The thinness makes up for it.+ durable design.  There aren't many cases available yet for this phone, but even without a case it seems durable.  I already dropped it once, on concrete, and other than having to replace the back cover, there were no issues.  The battery didn't even come out.+ vibrant screen.  The screen looks great on this phone.  I almost say that it looks as good as the display on my wife's iPod Touch.  The only concern with the screen is that it is 4.1 inches instead of 4.3, which has kind of become the new standard for Android phones, but I don't really think that .2 of an inch makes much difference.+ very good touch screen.  The touch screen on the Intercept had issues, compared to this phone.  We are finally able to play games on it, and type quickly on the touch screen.  Again, I think it is safe to compare it to the iPod Touch's performance.  Very good.+ fast processor.  Cutting edge Android phones are now starting to have dual-core chips.  The Snapdragon chip in this phone is single core, but that hasn't stopped it from doing everything that I've asked it to instantaneously.  Very snappy.+ Cameras.  The main camera on this phone is awesome.  Probably not as good as in an iPhone 4 or a real camera, but every bit as good as the stellar one in the iPod Touch.  The pictures and video it takes are amazing.  I don't think I'll ever be taking my real camera or my video recorder with me again.  Even the flash works well and doubles nicely as a flashlight.+ battery life.  The battery life on this phone is very good.  With any Android phone you can expect to have to recharge it daily, but this one at least uses its battery consistently and gradually.  That might not seem like a lot to ask for, but even with Android 2.2 many phones have battery management issues.  This one does not.+ GPS.  The GPS gets its signal pretty quickly and does a good job.  Not perfect in that sometimes you have a wait a few seconds, but none of them are.+ Vanilla Android.  I really like the fact that Virgin Mobile doesn't \"Skin\" their phones or put a bunch of bloatware on them.  This phone is pretty much stock Android 2.2 with a couple extra applications pre-installed.  Much better than the experience with other carriers that fill the phone up with their own software and interface.A few comments on Virgin Mobile:+ Network.  Network performance always depends on your location.  In some cities Verizon is great and AT&T; is terrible.  In others they both work great.  Virgin Mobile's phones operate on their parent company, Sprint's network.  Sprint and T-Mobile's networks as a whole, are not as good as Verizon's, but that does not mean they are terrible.  In my experience, this phone works very well in metropolitan areas, and pretty well in rural areas.  If your cell phone is your life-line and you spend time in rural areas, you may want to check the coverage for your area on Sprint's website.  Otherwise, I really having had any problems with the network.+ International.  Sprint and therefore Virgin Mobile only have network coverage in the US.  That means you can't roam internationally, which is both good and bad.  International roaming on any phone is very expensive.  When I travel outside the US with this phone, and want to make calls, I connect to Wifi in my hotel or at a shop, and use Skype.  It works perfectly and is much cheaper than international roaming, and is often free.I very strongly recommend that you ditch your contract phone and consider this phone or other Contract Free carriers.  AT&T; especially, and Verizon to some extent, are trampling all over their customers, and people are letting them.  The way to fix this situation is not archaic government regulation or laws, but rather consumers showing that they won't stand for it.  Get a contract free phone because it is the best thing for your wallet and works very well, but also know that if enough people do it the big carriers will have to improve the way they do business./// Update after 3 months of use.  ///I don't have much new to report on this phone, but wanted to provide an update after 3 months of use.  They are still working great.  Both my wife and I have had one from the beginning.  Neither of us have it in a case, and it is holding up very well both to purse life and hip life.  No scratches or anything despite normal drops and use.  A few points:+ Service continues to be great on this phone.  Virgin works much better on this than it did on the Intercept.+ I have had about 5 unexpected restarts in the three months of having the phone.  That isn't bad for an Android phone that gets a lot of use.  I think that some of those might have been caused by putting the phone 'power button side down' in the case, and inadvertently keeping it pressed.  Either way, I don't think that 5 is bad, especially if 3 of them were caused by the case.  My wife has never had an unexpected restart on her Triumph, though she doesn't use hers as much as I do.+ Screen.  The screen on this phone is great.  You do have to push a little harder on this phone than on some others, but you get used to it very quickly, and in the long-run, it is better.+ The camera is great (for a phone).I continue to be very happy with this phone, especially after its first three months of real life use.//// Updates after well over a year.  ////I haven been using this phone since the day it came out, over a year ago.  Although I'm disappointed that they haven't updated the OS to Gingerbread, I am overall still very happy with it.  I am especially happy with Virgin Mobile who seems to be improving every day.  They have always been acceptable, considering how cheap their plans are, but every aspect of their service just keeps getting better and better.  The 3G network is definitely getting faster, although possibly because they implemented a 2.5GB per billing cycle 'soft cap'.  Compared to what the contract carriers do when you use a lot of data, I think their soft cap approach is fair and benefits everyone on the network.  Their voice quality, network coverage, and availability also have improved dramatically over the past few years.  Also, their technical and customer service have gone from mediocre to excellent.I recommend Virgin Mobile more then ever.  I also recommend this phone, until they come out with better 'premium' phone offering to replace it with.By the way, Amazon's current price of $209 for this phone is a steal.//// Update as of summer 2012 ////I still think this is a great phone, especially for those who are grandfathered in to the $25 a month plan, but I have now upgraded to the HTC EVO V 3D 4G.  Anyone who is interested in 4G data speeds and carrier endorsed tethering capabilities might want to look into that phone.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Too many 1 stars and I think I can clear up this negative rating!!", "Author": "Danny K", "ReviewID": "R32H6K13IHNRI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I've been an Amazon reviewer reader and writer for many years! I use Amazon because I know the reviews are from real people like myself and I can tell from these reviews if a product is a problem. Now as a Virgin Mobile Samsung Intercept owner I wanted to upgrade and this large thin screen with a 1ghz processor seemed like a no brainer, so I read the reviews and what? There are many 5 star and many 1 star reviews....this confused me, but knowing that that is most always a 30 day money-back guarantee with the Virgin mobile phones I took my Amazon discounted Motorola Triumph page to my local Bestbuy electronics store and they matched the price! So if I may I would like to go into a quick past with my old Virgin mobile Samsung intercept for a second....I purchased the Samsung Intercept and had all sorts of problems, I upgraded the system operating system and with the correct apps made the Samsung a very stable smart phone but slow. I was pleased, but after a year and seeing that Virgin Mobile has a new DROID X phone called the Motorola Triumph I had to go for it. The Motorola phone size is thin, sturdy, beautiful screen and fast, in fact compared to the Samsung, super fast. The memory to run programs is about 1gb. This is just for programs!!! Everything works perfectly, Blue-tooth on my car, wifi, mp3 player,(I'm using power amp app which is fantastic)for videos I added the MX player app which is a must to play HD videos, speaking of HD videos/pictures the camera has a flash and takes perfect pictures and the camcorder can take 1280x 720 videos!  2x free app is a must for saving the battery draw. The 3G speed is about 3 times the Samsung Intercept, the screen is larger than an Iphone and super thin and the detail on the screen is just like my friends HTC fancy large android phone. I checked and my phone software ends in .39  Maybe if you check the one stars on this phone you will their software ends in .38  I don't know the difference and I don't care. I love this phone and I can tell you the reason people are complaining about the battery life is because this phone is so fast, so bright, so detailed and holds so many apps its hard to put it down and shut the screen off!!!!  In conclusion, I would like to point out that I did have a problem with the GPS starting time, so I did much reading and loaded the free GPS tester app on the phone (free on the market) and now I can run the tester if there is a problem and see the satellite signal etc and when I switch to the navigator GPS on the phone it shines!! This is the best Virgin Mobile Phone on the market! I'm one  still on the #25 dollar plan. BTW use superbox app, it does everything you need.PROS:Fast,runs every app I can throw at itVery bright screen and very detailedMemory for holding and running apps is 1gb (great)Memory for running the processor is 200mb or moreProcessor speed is 1gb  (fast)Pictures and Videos are fantastic taking and playing (set to high)Camera flash works wellCase is well designed with a rubber none slip feel and very thinCons:Battery life drains faster than I would like1. because the phone can not be put down!!!!2. Use the battery saver apps like 2x battery or others.IF you have a problem with the GPS starting,try running the free GPS tester app first.UPDATE:Everything above still stands. I also found the black Empire kit that Amazon sells with the pouch, car charger and AC charger to be a must. Also the phone comes with the side power button programmed to drop cellphone calls. You can unprogram this in settings. This is a must for me because I was cancelling my calls while taking the phone out of the pouch. I also downloaded the super keyboard app and it works better for emailing /texting on the screen. This phone is now my emailer, texter, mp3 player, camcorder, camera, flashlight, gaming device, newspaper reader, weather monitor, GPS (better than a garmin) my calculator, VM Minutes monitor, barcode reader,google voice search and much more anyone who gives this phone a one star is crazy, this is the best VM smartphone to date!UPDATE: April 2012 all above stands, except this phone does take a while to connect to the GPS signal and I now found that the fastest way to connect to GPS is to run the App GPS Status and toolbox. It is better than GPS tester and seems to help the phone connect to the GPS signal faster also I'm now using the GPS app Waze...wow Great GPS to Traveling...Try it!UPDATE: August 2012 all the above still stands. Love this phone. I noticed that Virgin mobile is now selling the HTC Evo 3d with 4G and a 1.2 ghz dual core processor. Then I looked at the PC mag reviews and the Amazon reviews and it appears that the HTC Evo 3g has problems receiving phone calls and texting. Too bad, I was ready to upgrade. PC Mag also says the Motorola Triumph is the best smartphone on virgin mobile to date. I agree!UPDATE: September 2012 Because I was frustrated that this phone took too long to connect to the gps satellites, I went to my local radio shack store and purchased the new Virgin Mobile HTC Evo 3D 4G phone. Radio Shack gives a 30 day money back guarantee, so how could I go wrong? It is noticeably faster than the Triumph but has a glich with texting. Glad I don't text much. My BW now has my Triumph and it works fine for her. See all the reviews on this unit!", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Triumph Means a Win for Users", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Patrick Justus\"", "ReviewID": "R2JAV4NIVRD5ZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Motorola Triumph is a thing of beauty and comes closest to the handheld device I've been dreaming of.  Ever since the days of the Palm T/X I've longed for a versatile PDA that could also make phone calls in a pinch. Using Wi-Fi to communicate makes so much more sense to me. Since then, I've watched communication devices increasingly become locked down money makers. (I get that you love your idroid, or whatever, but for me, I just don't see the value of paying a hundred bucks a month for what I always had for practically free.)  So for me, the biggest advantage of the Triumph is the very reasonable cost of ownership thanks to Virgin Mobile.  VM has cut their service to the bone, but like other savvy tech providers, has set up a mechanized operation that works on its own.  If you need help from Virgin, as a general rule for tech, stay away from the phone line and go to the forums, or use email.  Virgin Mobile Facebook is all you need to get over the hump of confusion caused by new adoption.  I have had no problems with the Triumph once I got dialed in.  The signal matches my LG Optimus V and both data and calls are clear even indoors in my suburb digs.  The Triumph has a larger screen, easier to use data entry, longer battery life, and a front facing camera for those \"free\" video chat calls.  All of that makes it worth the initial cost to me.  Once the setup (rather challenging at times) is over, it all works like a champ.Thanks to Motorola, Google, and Virgin, my dream of a handheld device that doesn't make me feel like I'm being gouged by the big providers has been comfortably sublimated.  Every time I pick up the Triumph, I feel like I'm sending another kind of message: a wake-up call to the big providers.  Triumph indeed.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "excellent, inexpensive phone", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R2TYPVGM3SRCGC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned a lot of Android phones.  The Triumph has a good screen, good build quality, good touch screen response, good processor, good reception, good voice quality, and good battery life.  The camera is decent (5 MPixel) but lacks a dedicated camera button.  The battery door is easy to open without being loose; however, you do need to remove the battery in order to change the MicroSD card.  The phone uses soft buttons that light up in the dark (I prefer physical buttons, but fewer and fewer phones have them).  It is refreshing and nice to see that the Triumph runs almost unmodified Android 2.2.2 (note that this is not the latest version, but it is compatible with most apps).For comparison, the Galaxy S II (which I also have, for use in Europe) is slightly better in all of those areas, but at more than twice the price; I find that none of the Galaxy S II's improvements over the Triumph in these areas are practically important.  The Triumph is an inexpensive and powerful workhorse, the Galaxy S II is a nice luxury.Some other reviews have noted poor battery life, crashes, poor responsiveness; I have not observed any of those on my Triumph.  With Android, it is easy to provoke such problems by installing badly behaved applications; if you are having such problems, check which applications are using the CPU and battery (there are built-in tools under Settings for that) and uninstall them.  The one software problem I have had is that Twitdroyd crashes on startup, but it does that on the LG Optimus as well. Reception is perhaps slightly worse than the LG Optimus (based on the number of bars), but I have had no problems with it.Some words about the plan (as of August 2011): at the increased price of $35/month, Virgin Mobile's service is still a good deal.  There didn't used to be alternatives, but now AT&T; also offers a prepaid plan with $25 for 500M/30 days plus voice; Verizon's prepaid plan on an Android phone will currently set you back $75/month at a minimum, and you end up using the truly awful Motorola Citrus.  Coverage on VirginMobile is more limited than Verizon or AT&T;, but it is still excellent in many parts of the US, including most urban areas I have been to.  Unlike the Optimus, where the WiFi tethering setting was accessible using a standard third party widget, however, you can't fool the Triumph into WiFi tethering anymore.In terms of apps, I like to use SlideIt as a keyboard (it's similar to Swype), and there is a Virgin Mobile minutes checker in the market that keeps track of plan minutes.Given its excellent price/performance ratio, I think the phone clearly deserves five stars.Added 2011-09-05: I noticed in forums that people had some problems.  First, there were complaints about slow GPS location acquistiion; the Triumph is slower than the Galaxy S II, but I haven't found it to be a practical problem.  Also, people were complaining about instability; I can't confirm that, my Triumph has been rock solid, despite tons of applications installed on it.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "For a prepaid carrier, you're not going to do much better right now", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R3FHU8GJ7DYOXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: I rooted and reflashed the phone almost immediately (two days) after getting it. This review is based on my experience using the phone with Gingerbread (Tickerguy's CM7/Reloaded).I've been using Virgin Mobile for almost a year now, having owned the LG Optimus V before the Triumph. The Optimus V is a robust phone with great battery life, but I wanted a bigger screen and a quicker processor, and the Triumph was the logical next step on the same carrier. I caught the Triumph on sale on Cyber Monday, and despite the mixed reviews I decided to order it and give it a whirl. I'll be making frequent comparisons to the Optimus V as it's the only other smartphone I've had, and I'd imagine many people looking into getting the Triumph are upgrading from the same (or a similar) phone.First impressions of the phone's build were quite good. It feels solid in my hand, and the Gorilla glass screen is fantastic after having used a plastic touchscreen for so many months. I cannot stress how nice having a glass screen feels. There is very, very minor creaking of the plastic, and I suspect that has more to do with the battery cover than anything else. On that note, the battery cover is one of the most annoying things about this phone. It will infrequently come off as I'm pulling the phone out of my pocket, and it took a little practice to learn how to put it back on correctly. It's not a huge deal and it would probably be remedied by putting a case on the phone, but I don't like the extra bulk that would add and I shouldn't have to do that anyway. The good news is that this problem doesn't seem to have gotten any worse over the few months I've had the phone.The screen itself is not great. I appreciate the larger size and resolution, but those are the only two advantages this phone has over the Optimus V. Contrast is somewhat poor compared to nicer (AMOLED) screens, and my particular phone has a not-insignificant amount of backlight bleed at the bottom, although it's only noticeable when it's displaying mostly black. Touchscreen responsiveness is okay after the phone has woken up, but sometimes it is unresponsive and there is the occasional weird bug (unlocking the screen using a gesture will sometimes only pick up certain \"dots\"). I can't tell if this is due to the ROM I'm using or the factory screen protector. Speaking of screen protectors, it is not needed on this phone, as it already has a screen protector installed. I haven't removed mine and I have no interest in doing so, but if you want to use your own screen protector, I highly recommend that you *carefully* remove the one that is factory set on the phone.As for the speed and general usability, I've found that it is MUCH quicker than the Optimus V. The Triumph has a 1ghz Snapdragon processor as opposed to the V's 600mhz Qualcomm processor. The difference is clear, and I will never go back to using a slower phone. The CPU and the larger screen real estate are easily the two best features of the Triumph. The few Android games I play (Cut the Rope and some Angry Birds) are smooth and responsive. Emulators (up to the SNES) work quite well, assuming there's no special hardware emulation involved. Star Fox, for example, is somewhat choppy but is about as playable as you're going to get on a touch screen. RPGs and platformers are smooth as butter.The battery life is clearly not going to be as good at the Optimus V, as the Triumph has a more powerful processor, larger and more power-hungry screen, and a smaller battery. With that said, I can get the phone to last for over 24 hours using Juice Defender and no task killers. This figure includes frequent texting, infrequent 3G data usage, and at least 30-45 minutes of phone calls a day. I do not have any personal experience with how this compares to the stock ROM, but I've seen anecdotal reports from others that battery life is significantly increased using CM7. To me, the decreased battery life as compared to the Optimus V is worth the advantages the Triumph offers.The camera is pretty decent, enough so that I haven't used my actual digital camera in months. It has an LED flash, but I really don't take many low-light pictures and the few that I have were perfectly visible, but washed out. This thing will light a room up, though, so I guess it does its job. Focus isn't super fast, but it's a camera phone and I'm not expecting the world of it. I haven't taken any videos but the ones I've seen on Youtube using the Triumph were average to above-average. The resolution and sound were pretty good but there's a kind of choppiness to the videos, like the phone couldn't absorb enough information during the recording process. Maybe this would be remedied by a faster SD card, but I don't have any personal experience on the subject with this phone.Nitpicking time... the Wifi and GPS radios on my phone are *terrible*. Wifi usually takes at least 15-20 seconds to turn on, and while I have not done any measurements or tests, it seems to drain the battery faster than using 3G. I'd imagine this is due to the time and power wasting activating the Wifi radio and then struggling to make a connection. For this reason, I almost exclusively use 3G (which works great in my area) unless I'm watching Netflix or updating a lot of programs at once. Once Wifi is connected it works well enough. The few times I've tried using the GPS, it never got a lock and I consider the feature worthless on my particular phone. This seems to be a \"luck of the draw\" kind of thing, although it may also be partially due to the ROM I'm using.The buttons have slowly but surely begun to feel rather chintzy. They weren't amazing to begin with, but now they just feel cheap. They still work fine, but it makes me uneasy as to the long-term life of their functionality. Again, nitpicking, but I feel it was worthy of mention.Last but certainly not least: call quality. 95% of the time I can hear others well and they can hear me. There are one or two people I talk to that have to repeat themselves every so often, although I suspect this is either their phone or the way they're holding it, so I can't conclusively blame this on the Triumph. On the receiving end, others have no problems hearing me. On occasion, maybe once every two weeks or so, my call will drop completely and the Triumph will completely shut down without warning, but this seems to happen more with one particular person than anyone else. I dismiss this as using a nonstandard ROM, and it's infrequent enough that it's a minor annoyance, although I would certainly be happy without it.In conclusion, if you'd like to upgrade from a slower phone on Virgin Mobile's network and you can get a good deal on the Triumph, I'd say go for it. I would certainly not pay $300, but I feel like $150-200 is a good middle ground. I've been mostly happy with the phone and will continue to use it until it breaks or something much, much better comes out. If you're on a post-paid network looking to switch over to prepaid, I would take a serious look at the LG Marquee on Boost Mobile's network. The screen is nicer and the phone specs and price are very similar, if not identical.This is my first review on Amazon (and a cellular phone, for that matter), and I hope my stream-of-thought review was thorough enough and not too disjointed. If anyone has any questions I'll do my best to answer them.*** UPDATE 12-15-12 *** - I'm looking at getting another phone soon, so I took the screen protector off, and WOW does it make a difference... After the initial touch, the screen is now *very* responsive. It's only been off for a day or two, so I don't know if it's going to be way more prone to scratches, but right now it feels like a new phone.I will also say that, after having bought two different phones (the LG Venice and HTC Evo V 4g) with the intention of switching, neither has come close to the battery life I'm getting with Triumph and the ROM I'm using (Whyzor's CM7, if I remember correctly), and each have their downsides. I'm probably just going to go straight to the Samsung Galaxy S2 and an extended battery pack.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "A few key facts - UPDATED with Problems", "Author": "Gabe W", "ReviewID": "R2WFALG10XH1HP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "[UPDATE: My initial review was posted after using the phone for 2 or 3 days.  I've now used it for one or two more weeks, and numerous problems have been revealed, leading to me downgrading my review from 5 stars to 2.  See my new comments further down.UPDATE 2: I've had the phone for nearly a month now and it is getting returned.  The final update is at the bottom.]I won't do a comprehensive review of this phone because they're already out there.  In general, I will just say that this phone is far faster and smoother than the LG Optimus V I was using.  Download speeds are also greatly increased - apparently this has as much or more to do with the phone itself as it does with the network.  It's easiest to see the difference in download speeds over your Wifi at home, where the speed should be the same as it was with a different phone yet in fact it's now much, much faster.A few key facts then, both pros and cons:Swype: The phone does not ship with the Swype keyboard pre-installed.  Nevertheless, it is possible to get Swype for the phone easily, and without rooting the phone.  Just go to Swype's official website and click on the \"join\" link to get access to Swype \"beta\" (I'm not sure what's beta about it, it's unbelievable and vastly improved over the version of Swype I was using on the Optimus V).  Swype will then send you an e-mail with a link in it.  Open that e-mail *on your phone*, click on the link, and the rest just happens.Screen Protection: I'm 99% sure this phone ships with a screen protector already on it.  I know this because 1) I saw a video somewhere (I think Howard Forums) of a guy who claimed that his came with a screen protector on it, and who then removed that protector on the video (he didn't like screen protectors), and 2) now that I have the phone myself, I can see that at the *very* edge of the screen, there is a line that can be seen that seems to divide between a layer underneath and something that's on top of it but doesn't *quite* perfectly cover every millimeter of the surface - though that's probably on purpose, so that you can remove it if you want to or it becomes necessary.  With the factory screen protector on, the screen nevertheless looks vibrant and clear, and feels quite smooth.  I'd think it was just glass if I didn't know better.  It's pretty glossy and picks up a fair amount of glare, and is prone to lots of smudges and fingerprints.  FYI, the guy on Howard Forums claimed that after removing the screen protector the screen was somewhat more vibrant but also had more glare.  However, he was most impressed by how much more responsive the screen felt now that there was no separation between his finger and the actual glass.  If you don't want a screen protector, or want to swap out the factory one for a different one (perhaps at a later time if the one from the factory gets scratched up), you can remove the factory one.  The video guy pulled up the edge with a thumbtack.Internal Memory: Initial reports indicated that this phone had only 512MB of internal memory, and as of now the Virgin Mobile site also indicates that.  That appears to be incorrect.  According to the App2SD app, I have 1.05GB of internal memory.  By contrast, the Optimus V had only 140MB of internal memory, and for me that ran out VERY quickly.  With Android Version 2.2 and above, many apps can now be \"moved\" from the phone's internal memory to an SD card.  Nevertheless, how much usable *internal* memory you have is critical, because 1) many apps are not movable to the SD card, regardless of what version of Android you're running, 2) many apps only have full functionality if you're keeping them on the phone's internal memory (this most commonly comes up for apps that have widget functionality - the widgets cannot be used if the app is on the SD card), and 3) EVEN when you move an app to the SD card, all apps *still* leave portions of themselves on the internal memory.  You can see how much internal memory an app is using by going to Settings > Applications > Manage Applications and looking up the particular app (if you want to see how much memory an app is taking up on an SD card, use App2SD).  On the Optimus V, I had a number of apps that, even though officially \"on the SD card\", still left 2, 4, even 10 MBs on internal memory.  Thus, having 7 1/2 times the internal memory of the Optimus V is huge.Conclusion: I give the phone 5 stars because it not only does everything I expected of it but is also snappier and has more internal memory than reported.  The addition of a factory-installed screen protector (without air bubbles!) is also, to me, a plus.  The only negatives are that the screen is prone to smudges, and that the phone ships without Swype - but, as I explained, that's easily rectified.UPDATE: After using the phone for another one or two weeks, numerous problems have cropped up.  First, two additional positive points:LED light - The Triumph has an LED light that is located behind the earpiece grille.  It glows red when charging (green to et you know it's done), and pulsates when you have a new notification message.  This is a handy feature that the LG Optimus didn't have.Netflix - The free Netflix app is now available for the Triumph in the Android marketplace.  Streaming to the Triumph over a Wifi connection works nicely.  Last I saw the Optimus didn't have this app available, and maybe it couldn't because the phone needs more processing power to handle the streaming.And now for the problems that have cropped up:Restarts - The phone randomly restarts itself every so often.  It was not dropped on the floor nor did it get wet.Battery life/Reception - The battery life of this phone is decidedly worse than that of the Optimus.  I can only say this anecdotally as I haven't done \"testing\" per se - the phone just dies way too fast, and this is with options like Wifi, GPS< and Bluetooth turned off.  As further evidence, I have a widget from the \"Juiceplotter\" app.  On a full charge for the Optimus, it would say I had something like 17 hours of battery life (presumably in standby conditions, not if you talked on the phone for 17 hours straight, obviously).  On the Triumph, the same widget gives me a maximum of 10 hours on a full charge, but in practice the phone doesn't come close to matching that. The reception is also definitely worse than the Optimus was, but again I can only comment on that anecdotally.Non-responsiveness - Sometimes the \"back\" button on the phone simply won't work for a while.  I'll be using an app and won't be able to get out of it except by using the \"home\" button.  The fact that the \"home\" button works indicates that the phone's CPU isn't just completely choked on something.  The app and phone are working, it's just that the back button checks out every so often.  The \"menu\" button  does the same thing, but a bit less often.Build quality - In the lower left corner of the phone, where the glass screen meets the outer hard plastic border of the phone, there is light leakage whenever the phone's screen is on.  It's only in this one spot.  I find it distracting and annoying and wonder what it says about the build quality of the phone.NEW Conclusion: It's always possible that the problems I've had are isolated to my particular phone, but all I can do is report on my own experiences.  If other people have the same experiences, then I think this phone's problems seriously outweigh its advantages, and you're better off going back to the more humble but more reliable Optimus.FINAL UPDATE: I've had the phone now for almost a month.  Its habit of restarting itself randomly has only increased, and the touch screen and touch-sensitive buttons remain unresponsive at times.  In addition, the battery life has been revealed to be absolutely abysmal.  In standby mode, the phone can lose up to 10% of its charge per hour, and of course loses it far more rapidly if it is actually being used.  I've decided that even if a phone wipe could somehow clear the first two problems, it certainly wouldn't improve the battery life or poor signal strength, so the phone is being returned.

I waited to write a review because sometimes issues with the phone aren't going to be evident until you've messed around with it for a while.Before purchasing this phone, I did loads of research on the internet. There were many complaints about the device, so I was contemplating the actual purchase. I've heard many complaints about the GPS not connecting, the front-face camera not working,the lock screen flashing, not being able to get service and many other things. But for Virgin Mobiles $25/month [I've been with them for a while, so I haven't had to change to the $35/month yet. Still... $35?!] I figured I would give it a shot, and return the phone within 30 days if it was really that bad. I'm very happy that I made this decision.When I first took it out of the box, I was surprised on how sturdy the phone felt in my hand. With a 4.1 inch screen the phone itself is beautiful. After letting the phone charge I turned it on and was delighted to see how bright and colorful the screen was. It was very quick, with its 1 GHz processor. It literally whips through pages and it's menus.I noticed, though, after I activated the phone, that on average, I only get about 2/4 bars of service while in 3G. I thought this would be an issue [keep in mind I live somewhat in the boondocks... or outer suburbs.] but after using the phone for the last 30 days, I can happily say that I have NEVER lost a call, or not been able to receive/send text messages. Ever. But! Sometimes, if I go into a basement, or somewhere really out in the boonies [like a cornfield] I will drop down to 1x and not be able to use the 3G internet. But dropping down to 1x has never stopped me from using the phone... as a phone. A reminder:: You're on sprint's network. Point made. If you're looking for the best service... go pay $100/month for AT&T; or Verizon. Other than that, the internet was quick [comparing to the blackberry bold, motorola cliq, and sidekick]. Flash is available. Videos load pretty averagely. Quicker than any of the phone's I've ever owned, but I've seen other phones [like the galaxy S II] completely beast on YouTube.People had a problem with the GPS. I don't know if it was just their phones, or their location, but my Triumph locked me in a location quickly [within 2 minutes]. I never use the GPS, but I had to try it out because of all the complaints. It worked just fine for me.This phone is really a beauty, though. The pictures come out crisp with it's 5 megapixels. I know that doesn't compare to the 8MP that are on some of the higher end phones, but 5MP is enough. Has flash and zoom. Good camera overall. I have NEVER had an issue with the front-face camera. It works every time. I have not tried using it for face talk though, so find another review for that. The video is great. 720p. It does blur when moving it, but most videos do. Sound is great as well.It is a droid, so you get all of the perks of the Android Market, plus the beauty of a solid motorola [without motoblur, might i add (: ..]. Just be careful with what you download because the phone only comes with 152 MB of internal memory. It also comes stock with a 2GB micro SD card, but you can get up to 32 GB for all the extra space you need.Overall, this phone is great. It's quick and powerful. I can do anything I want with it, without any problems. I have yet to see the lock screen flashing/flickering. It's been absolutely fine for me. I love this phone. It works wonderfully, calls are clear. Texting is fast [the keyboard is great, and I like that it doesn't auto correct for you. But there isn't a dictionary that suggests words for you. I never used that anyways. It does help you with words like I'll.. Where it will capitalize the \"I\" and add an apostrophe for you. Other than that, you're on your own. People will have to actually have to learn how to type correctly without relying on auto correct. Bummer. (; haha]If you have the funds to afford the iPhone 4S or the Galaxy S II, then by all means, go for that phone, but if you're on a budget and want a decent phone that is closer to high-end, than I highly recommend the Moto Triumph. I've gotten a lot of compliments on this phone, and I haven't had anyone guess that I'm on a prepaid plan for only $35/month.

Particularly because i have big hands and fatty thumbs, this phone has solved my problem due to the large screen and keys i can type very accurately and quickly.The phone is quick and never lags. pictures are pretty good with the 5mp camera, the video recording is not that great but for a cell phone i found it to be reasonable. internet browser is pleasant and doesnt give me any trouble. videos works great. found the phone's performace to be on par with the iphone 4 the only real difference being that it has a slightly smaller screen resolution, but that hasnt been noticeable. the android operating system is very nice, allows lots of access to apps and is simple to use.As for the carrier. Virgin mobile has been pretty good. they are low cost at $35 per month for unlimited data(3g) and texting and 300 talk minutes. there signal is great in the city and close to. When i go camping is the only time i dont get service. I certaintly cannot complain when i was paying over $60 at other companies.

Haggard", "ReviewID": "R2PEF73FOP4POV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been a user of the Virgin Mobile Optimus V phone for the last few months. As a former iPhone 3G customer I was impressed to see such a snappy device on a no-contract plan. Well a few months later Virgin announced the Motorola Triumph. After a few weeks of hesitation I went out and bought it for $299 from my local best buy.  Not even 48 hours later it's been boxed back up and is going back. I've reactivated my old Optimus V and will stick with that one.What's wrong with the Motorola Triumph?1. QualityThe build quality isn't bad. In fact it meets my expectations for the most part. I have zero issues with the design of the battery cover, the buttons, etc. My issue is with the light leak and this is the most minor of my complaints. You can see where the screen is held onto the frame because on the bottom of the screen there are 2 points where you can see a gap and light coming through around the screen. This is minor, but when I tried out the netflix app I found it distracting.2. Touch / ResponsivenessThis is the #1 reason this phone is going back. My phone (wonder if it's all) has serious lag problem when you scroll through the app drawer. At first it's ok, but if you scroll all the way down and then back up and let it sit for a second to find the app you want you'll find that the phone locks up for a few seconds and is unresponsive. This is a STOCK phone with only the standard default apps. Then as you browse through the phone the back button at the bottom of the screen is often unresponsive and requires several pushes. At times I had to push the power button to turn the phone off and back on to get the screen to respond. Personally I've never had this type of issue with the Optimus V or my iPhone which leads me to believe this is either poor design or a software flaw.3. Customer ServiceThis is a problem, I haven't actually called Motorola but in searching to see if my phone was defective Sunday or not I came across Motorola's official support forums. In there I found a thread where a customer found that his version of the phone came with firmware ending in .38, other people however had .39. When he posted a question on how does he upgrade the response from Motorola was poor to say the least. In fact if you go to motorola's website and try to use their device update tool the Triumph isn't even a supported phone, there is no way to download the new firmware and even OTA updates say the package is missing. A few weeks back the question was asked when would current users on the .38 get the .39 update, and WHAT was in that update? The response from Motorola was \"we will try to find out the difference in the firmware\". I think this should be posted clearly on the motorola site saying new firmware is avaialble and here's what it fixes. Not hide the fact they released a new version and some phones come with it, some phones don't and if it doesn't you can't get it.... So then the question was asked when would it be available and below is the response:Motorola: We are currently investigating the difference between the two software versions. As soon as we have information I will share it with you.Customer (5 days after previous post): What is the ETA?Motorola: \"As I said before, when there is information to be shared, it will be shared. In the meantime there is no news.\"That last post was on August 10th, 2011. That means as of today it's been 10 days and still no answer on a firmware software update for triumph owners with the .38 version.I'm not even sure .39 will fix all the issues I'm having with the touch screen, but the fact remains customer service from Motorola sort of lacks here.4. BatteryThe battery leaves a lot to be desired. It actually gets worse life then my Optimus V from initial tests before I installed any battery saver apps. I'm sure once I installed an app it would help out greatly, but stock phone/battery life is dismal at best. Be prepared to have a charger on you at all times if you plan on USING the phone for any purpose like reading a book on the kindle app, getting on the web or even just tinkering around in the screens. You'll see the battery life fall pretty fast.So what's right with the phone?1. CameraThe main camera is pretty good. I took several pictures at the lake and they all were in focus and had no issues. It's not the higest MP camera I've used but for what it is it works well. The front facing camera in good light looks great, in low light it looks terrible.2. ScreenThe main display is bight and crystal clear, it looks great which is a plus when the phone lags and you are stuck at least you have something nice to look at.3. Slim designIt's a bit bigger then an iphone 3G, and a little larger then my blackberry Bold in terms of height and length. It's thinner then both in terms of width.4.

I used the money I saved buying from Amazon to purchase a micro 32gb sd card and found right away that most apps are movable between the phone and the sd card.

I was happy with a LG Optimus V before this, but the deal was too good to pass up. I knew it had a lot of problems from the user reviews all over the internet (ignore VMUSA's website since they filter only good reviews).I upgraded to CM7 gingerbread custom ROM right away and it fixed some of the major issues on stock ROM. But there were still a lot of problems with the phone's hardware and quality control. I've been active and following developments on a few forums regarding this phone the past few months. Some of the persistent problems reported by many people are:1. GPS flaky and takes a long time to lock on (open source developers report aGPS has never worked on the Triumph, cold GPS locks take 1-3 minutes)2. Touchscreen misses or ignores often (even on completely rewritten touchscreen driver)3. Capacitive buttons freeze up occasionally (same problem in different ROMs)4. Running out of internal memory due to some logging mechanism that fills up internal storage and can't be turned off except by factory reset (only on stock ROM)5. A lot of devices have cameras that take pictures with a green blob in the center in indoor lighting (I have this problem no matter what camer app is used)6. Charging port goes bad prematurely (I have to jiggle mine carefully)7. Light leakage from bottom capacitive button LEDs when screen has dark background.I've noticed most of the good reviews are from people either new to Android or coming from the Intercept (which was a very poor phone to start with). VM does have a 1yr replacement policy, but many people report having VM send them a refurbished replacement that has a different set of problems. Given all these problems, the phone is ok for the price I paid (around $100), definitely not worth it for over $200. Motorola & VM-USA dropped the ball on this product and cut too many corners.

So far, my wife and I love the Motorola Triumph and we love Virgin Mobile.  The Motorola Triumph feels like a high end smartphone with great pricing (we chose the $45 per month Virgin Mobile BEYOND TALK plan).  We had the iPhone 3G for 2+ years.  My wife upgraded to the iPhone 4 and I upgraded to the HTC Inspire 4g.  While we both enjoyed the phones, we did not enjoy the monthly bill...as high as $450 (normally $200+).  I am in the military stationed in Japan and I've used Virgin Mobile for the last 6 years while I've been stateside on vacation and business.  The coverage area (Sprint Network) for Virgin Mobile is great for my needs (major cities, suburbs, major roads and interstate driving).  The Motorola Triumph is a great smartphone that's more capable than the iPhone 3G but it's not in the iPhone 4S or Samsung Galaxy Class.  For me, the price, functionality and coverage area more than compensates for the technical specs.  The GPS has some issues and the camera freezes from time to time...nothing that a restart doesn't fix.  Overall, I don't buy smartphones for their camera & GPS.  Similarly, I don't go to Pizza Hut looking for a hamburger.  If anything, these features are merely a bonus and \"nice to have.\"  The phone works great and the Apps Store (Google Play) has more apps then I know what to do with.

What I find really distressing is that there is no plan in place to address these serious issues that essentially render the phone useless for prime time usage. I am surprised that the phone was released with so many serious and glaring issues. The team that did QA on this product was simply incompetent. There are no other words for a failure of this magnitude.Here are the biggest issues for this phone:1. Bluetooth doesn't keep connection live. Connection time varies between few seconds to a few minutes. Most of the time it will not connect on it's own. Both A2DP and handset profile suffer from this. This is the most complained about issue on Motorola's forums. How does a $300 phone not have simple bluetooth working is beyond me. This one just  slipped through the cracks probably. Big thumbs down.2. GPS takes 3-15 minutes to lock. This is also unacceptable and basically makes the phone useless as a GPS.3. Wi-fi also shows finicky behavior where the connection stays open but nothing can be sent or received. Needs wifi to be disconnected and then reconnected to work.All of the three issues are \"known\" but there is no plan to release an update to fix these serious issues.I heard some rumors on internet that a fix will be released in 18 months!

At first I had some of the same problems listed in other reviews, but found apps to solve every one of them. The three apps that helped a LOT are Android Assistant, Lookout & ESPECIALLY Juice Defender. I do have an extra battery & a wall charger to keep a fully charged one on hand, but the life is greatly extended with Juice Defender. Android Assistant keeps my phone running well also - it's \"cacher cleaner\" keeps it running at full speed & can be set to run automatically at various intervals. Without that the phone will slow down to a crawl after a while on the internet.I have seen a few people talk about the SCREEN PROTECTOR they think comes on the phone in addition to the thin plastic sheet that peels off. I dropped my phone last week & unfortunately shattered the top corner of the LCD. Since I have another on order, I decided to try to peel this thicker sheet off. You can see this added layer around the edges of the screen. YES it does come off & YES it improves the screen clarity & sensitivity. It is a very thick , very sticky sheet of plastic.IMPORTANT UPDATE: I have done some research & decided to NOT pull the plastic layer  off my new phone. The display is 262k TFT which stands for Thin Film Transistor Liquid Crystal Display. PLEASE look up \"TFT LCD\" & \"Liquid Crystal\" on Wikipedia before you peel it off. There are good explanations of the construction of such screens & I now believe it is meant to stay on!! Maybe I'm wrong but please look up those terms first.For me the memory is great (I have about 100 apps on it including stock), the processor is very fast (I've tried newer phones & the increase in speed is very little), and it is VERY customizable. I've changed the look completely & love it. There are many icons, themes, fonts to use. And you can find enough to make your phone look & behave a lot like an iPhone or like it has Gingerbread or Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS).In my opinion, don't be scared off by initial \"problems\" if you want to call them that. It just needs a little work & customization & you can have an incredible phone for no contract & a CHEAP monthly fee through Virgin Mobile.

Needless to say, using a virtual keyboard takes some getting used to and I do text a lot but also needed a larger screen to view webpages and wanted to give Virgin Mobile a try after some disappointment with larger, more traditional providers.The Good: Virgin Pricing/BusinessVirgin does a great job of being a low-cost mobile carrier that appeals to a wide variety of consumers and utilizes a major network of cell towers (Sprint) that follows large cities and the US Interstate system.  Plans for this phone are $35 up to a modest $55/month for everything.  Data is unlimited but speed throttling starts at 2.5 GB/plan month (change occured in March 2012).  Set-up, number porting, and support is easily done through Virgin's telephone service or website.  (Unfortuantely the website does not have chat support, but holds are short or non-existant on their support line.)The Good: Camera/ScreenThis is by far the best camera I have purchased inside a phone.  The rear-facing 5MP camera (I have yet to use the flash or front-facing 3MP camera) takes incredibly clear photos and uploads them quickly to Facebook when attached to a 3G or greater data connection.  Daylight photos are astounding and it has some type of image stabilization that is the best I've seen in a small lens camera like this.  The screen is very clear and I can even read some webpages when they are displayed in a desktop-computer type view.  Controls are all on-screen, not sure if the side button can be programmed to act as shutter.  Pinch/Expand is quick to respond as well.The Good: Processor and AudioI've used this phone at my office and in my car to stream Pandora digital music and it handles the app and reproduces audio beautifully through it's headphone jack to an aux audio cord for my car stereo or through earbuds.  The speakerphone is average and not a good music player but serves its purpose adequately for calls.The Good: DurabilityI've had this phone for a month and while I haven't put it through rigerous paces, it can withstand a short drop (hand to counter) and has a slightly rubberized case for shock-resistance and ease of grip.  The surface is Corning Gorilla Glass so it is unlikely it will crack or scratch.  The four ports (micro HDMI Out, Micro USB charge/data, and 3.5 mm headphone jack) are uncovered and reasonably simple to keep clean.The Good: AppsThis phone will support almost any app on the Android Market/Google Play, I have yet to come accross one that refuses to install due to incompatibility and Verizon doesn't load on too many that are unnecessary.The Bad: AppsFacebook's App (Ver 1.8.4 for Android) really hates this phone.  I've used that version successfully on older phones and it doesn't have critical failures like it does on the Motorola Triumph.  No damage to the phone or other applications, but it will close instantly when trying to load Facebook for no visible reason.The Bad: Coverage/WiFi compatibilityI live in a metropolitain area and believed there would be good coverage; unfortunately I am in a brick building and the network Virgin uses is Sprint-only (not their affiliates), so only a few area towers are accessible but this device overcomes that dilemma by using my WiFi network.  Unfortunately I can't find a good VOIP application and unlike my old Motorola, this one does not have it installed or I can't locate the mode.  The result is I can get quick internet inside my apartment using my WiFi network but when a call is coming, I need to lean out the window--with the weak cellular connection the phone keeps detaching/re-joining my wireless network which is frustrating for sending text messages or using data.The Bad: Something every phone should haveEvery manufacturer who puts a \"flash\"/high intensity LED on the back of their phone should keep a \"flashlight\" app/button to give you 15 seconds- a minute of light while dimming the display to make it easy to find things in the dark.  I know it drains battery fast--everyone does, but we want this feature!!!The Ugly: As with all smartphones, battery technology hasn't kept up with power-hungry processors and displays and like all phones, this one will not maintain power on standby for a full 24 hours without recharging.  Motorola should know we'd gladly carry around a phone 2mm thicker with an extra 2 ounces of weight if it could hold a charge longer than a day!Bottom line: This phone is a good start for Virgin Mobile to carry an Android phone and the price point is appropriate but there are a few improvements needed in this model as well as the Virgin network before it can satisfy customers used to the coverage and handsets offered by traditional cellular carriers.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "Author": "A. Deger", "ReviewID": "RXDBZGGAPNTEW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was suspecting the worst about this phone (especially in terms of battery life) but I've been pleasantly surprised so far. I was formerly using a T-Mobile HTC MyTouch 3g which T-Mobile had pushed a major update to (Froyo possibly) but which essentially crippled the phone in terms of responsiveness.  Before solving that issue I switched to Virgin (for the cheaper service) and, overall, have been pleased.  Note that I'm not a mobile phone power user and just use it for occasional web browsing, checking email, text (sometimes storms) from my IT firm's monitoring/alerting system and a few apps here and there; I do not \"live\" on the phone as many do.  I also don't really miss the data rates that 4g provides (as compared to this phones 3g service). Highlights:Pros==========* I like this phone's form factor (although it is somewhat larger) and it's bigger viewing area.  My eyes suck so this brightness, clarity and size of the screen compared to the MyTouch is superior and it seems good compared to friends' \"more modern\" phones;* Pretty responsive overall;* Battery life has been ok so far.  I generally keep the GPS off (but it really sucks the battery when on) and I occasionally turn WiFi off when I know I won't be near an access point (e.g., bus ride home).  Phone will certainly make it through a whole day for me.  I was careful to do the full discharge/full charge cycle which some users have suggested to avoid a theoretical \"short memory\" condition.  I also don't do a ton of voice calling and will be WAY under my monthly allotment of 300 minutes. I'm also pretty good about using the Advanced Task Killer Widget to keep (draining) apps killed and don't use any battery intensive animated wallpapers or constantly-updating widgets;* Camera is decent and serves my needs;* I like the plain vanilla Android implementation as opposed to things like Moto interface, etc.Cons===========* Signal strength isn't that great but has rarely been completely out.  This of course is pretty location dependent but seems noticeably lower than from when I had Sprint (which Virgin resells) some years ago* Laggy when waking up from sleep.  Have to hit the \"Home\" button repeatedly before it decides to respond.* Somewhat larger form factor which can be a con for some.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you want to use Virgin Mobile buy the Optimus V, NOT the Moto Triumph", "Author": "Mike Crabtree \"Constitutional Guard Dog\"", "ReviewID": "RZQS1P945IOWJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned every Android Virgin Mobile has had to date. At first I thought VM was just a bad provider because my Samsung Intercept had so many dropped calls, late or missing text and other problems not related to the service.When the Optimus V came out, I traded the Samsung in for it. I had had the Intercept for less than 30 days, less than 30 days that felt like a life time. Unless you like pain and headaches don't buy that phone.When I got the Optimus V nearly all those troubles were gone. Few if any dropped calls, Text went through quickly, GPS worked great (but to be fare, the GPS on the Intercept worked well too) and all the dire problems that were warned about because of the phones lower hardware specs never came to pass. Of the three VM phones I have had, the Optimus V was the best, Not the fastes but the most stable, where the phone worked as it was supposed to.Then came the Motorola Triumph. What can I say about this phone that is nice...........The screen looks good.........when it works.Easier to say whats not nice about it.Have tried to hook up to a half dozen phones by blue tooth. It will see the other phones but no talk to them. Screen flickers all the time, There is a dead spot that runs up and down the middle of the screen, some times it works and sometimes it is dead, back button only works about 60% of the time, Internet gets me a white screen more often than not and is pretty much useless, GPS only works if you use GPSfix first. Run GPSfix app before you need to use the GPS on the phone or you will never get a GPS lock. I have had to add a third party launcher to the phone which has helped a little with the phones stability. On my phone at least the launcher is not handling things well. I had to add Android Assistant to manage the apps and hardware usage to free up resources to reduce glitches in the phone.I am still trying to find apps that might help this phone, and it looks like people are getting the word that this phone is not worth the 300.00 that Virgin Mobile and Motorola think it is worth as no one wants to buy my phone. or even trade for 3/4 value.About Virgin Mobile. Their service is good if you live in an area where Sprint is well received. If Sprint service is spotty where you live, no phone is going to make it better.If your in a good Sprint area buy the Optimus V, it cost half that of the Triumph and works. It does not have flash but for me I would rather do without flash and have a stable phone than have a phone that does flash but I cant get on line with because the browser is goofed some how.If the Optimus V is not to your liking, wait for something better to come along. The Optimus Black/Marquee is thought to be out around Christmas and there is word that a couple other phones may be out before the end of the year. I strongly suggest that what ever you decide to get, do not get it the moment it is released.

You may think well its just your area, but no, I had the optimus V before this one and never had signal issues or GPS lock issues.

This is my first phone with real usable internet service. It's kinda slow at times, but I think in my area, the signal is very weak, making internet very slow. I have used the phone in areas with 4 bar antenna strenght, and both 3G arrows on, and speed is great.After about a year of use, it did not want to charge unless I played with the charger plug in order to get charging light on, then after a couple months of that it would not take charge at all. I cleaned out the charge plug of all the dust and dirt, and it started charging, but that repair only lasted a week or two before it failed again. I purchased 3 batteries from amazon, and a charger that charges batteries on the wall, and just change batteries when they die.Phone reception can be great to awful. Usually bad calls are due to low signal, and most times, people using cheap junk phones on the other end that transmit blurred audio due to cheapness.I don't mess with most of the apps that come with phone, and when updates come in I don't accept, due to taking up too much space. The message will come up \"Low Space\", so inless I use that app, like useless, silly, facebook screw it.For my use its been a good phone. It will be 2 years old on 2/14/14.

Its been banged around and dropped alot, and at worst, all I had to do was pull battery and fire it up again.This phone isn't available anymore from virgin, so I'm thinking about going with an HTC phone when this one hits it's second birthday.

I wouldn't want to offend any old ladies or teach any new words to the chillen's. It's just difficult to express how burned I feel on this purchase without a little harsh brusqueness, but here goes.This was an upgrade from an LG Optimus V which was my first Android phone. The LG was a great phone and I was mostly happy with it, but it was woefully short on RAM and built-in memory, so it was always complaining that it was out of space. It got so that there were no more programs I could uninstall or move to the SD card. So I went all out for the Motorola. The Triumph has a great form factor. It's thin with a nice large screen with great resolution. And it has plenty of RAM and onboard memory. AND it has a decently fast processor! Animation and response is good. So why do I blankity strongly dislike this blasted piece of stuff??1. Touch sensitivity - Sometimes it is as sensitive as it should be and you can lightly brush your finger to scroll or gently tap the screen. A VERY GOOD PART of the time, at random, it ignores your presses and swipes and you end up angrily and repeatedly STABBING at it and SCRAPING your finger over it. I never had this problem with the LG.2. Network connectivity - I have used several wi-fi devices at home, from my old LG phone to my Kindle Fire and asus netbook. They have NEVER EVER had any trouble connecting to the house wi-fi. This stupid thing very very frequently can't even turn on the wifi and and just says 'Error' in the wifi status. Solution - yank out the battery, pop it back in and reboot. Then it works.Sometimes, not very often thankfully, it can't even connect to the PHONE NETWORK!!!!! SOLUTION?? Yank out the battery, pop it back in and reboot. Then the network magically reappears. And no I never had this problem with the LG.3. Randomly reboots itself. While sitting alone with nothing touching it. Hmmm, the LG didn't did this either. Wow!So hey, I'm still using it, since it cost me mucho dinero less than six months ago. But I have to think that Motorola isn't trying or doesn't even care about putting out a quality product. I don't buy Apple iProducts, but I know 'gosh-darn' well they would never release anything as shoddy as this. There are so 'golly-dang' many Android phones out there, they are like commodities where we only judge them on specs, expecting them to all behave the same. But that is FAR FAR from the truth. They all have their own hardware quirks. I can't wait to switch to something better and I will never buy another Motorola because of this thing. Don't get suckered into buying it by the people who can't admit how much they hate it because the cognitive dissonance from their buyer's remorse won't let them. Thanks for reading my review.

After three months my opinion has changed. First I noticed the signal strength was a lot weaker than my previous phone that was on the same network (Sprint). I chalked up the poor battery life to using a lot of apps and WiFi. Now I realize that it should last more than 9 hours, especially when that nine hours is over night when I am sleeping and not using the phone. The icing on the cake was when it started rebooting at least once a day, sometimes 2-3 times a day. Then, while I had it plugged in and charging, it shut off but did not reboot. Eventually I removed and reinstalled the battery. This got it to reboot. I got a phone call a short time later. While I was talking, the phone just rebooted again. I called Virgin Mobile and they are sending a replacement phone. I hope it works better than this one. A quick Google search reveals that this model is known for having these problems. I wish I had researched a little better before I took the $220 plunge. Before you ask, yes I uninstalled every app I installed and even did a factory data reset to no avail.

When I began shopping for my first smartphone, I immediately ruled out the contract carriers: a $90/month plan is simply too pricey for a college student. Since I was already a VMUSA customer, I looked at their smartphones on the beyond talk plans and fixated on the Triumph. I wanted to make a well-informed decision, so I scoured the internet for known issues. I was almost dissuaded from buying the phone after scouring the forms: people were absolutely full of negative comments about this phone. Complaints about a defective GPS chip, growing log file that easily fills the memory, screen sensitivity issues, dysmal reception, dropped bluetooth connections, a flickering screen, and faulty camera autofocus were commonplace. After considering my other options, however, I decided to take the plunge and buy the phone. Trust me when I say that this is the ONLY VM PHONE WORTH A DAMN; all of the other phones are WEAK SAUCE compared to the Triumph. I expected a plethora of issues. I even took the time to familiarize myself with Amazon's return policy. However, I experienced NONE of the issues that people were complaining about, and I've owned the phone for three months.

I use the Virgin Mobile $35/month plan and it has enough minutes for me.No, the Triumph is not as good as an iphone or a Nexus, but you can't expect that for half the up front price, half the monthly price, and no contracts. What you do get is an above average smartphone with a good operating system (and very little crapware). The 4.1\" screen is easier on my eyes than the little 3.5\" screens that were common a year ago. The CPU and memory have double the specs of my old phone and it really shows when running Android apps. The camera is adequate for my use, though not nearly as good as a decent point & shoot.The negatives to this phone are slow GPS lock (for you people that like to check in everywhere), mediocre battery life (barely lasts through the day with average use), and below average signal quality. Cell service is noticeably worse than Verizon; probably comparable to AT&T; or T-Mobile. Virgin Mobile is owned by Sprint and uses Sprint's network, but apparently not all of it, so coverage is worse than Sprint.If this phone cost as much as an iphone or Android Nexus phone, I would give it only 2 or 3 stars because of the negatives. I'm upping that to 4 stars because of the cheap price; especially the monthly rate. The cell service is probably not adequate for serious professional use, but I don't mind being a little hard to reach if it saves me a lot of money.For your best price, buy this phone directly from Virgin Mobile instead of 3rd party sellers.

Virgin Mobile's monthly rates are excellent, and have significantly reduced my phone bill after switching from Verizon. Furthermore, porting my old number from Verizon wireless was a very simple process.The Good: The Triumph is a very nice looking phone, it comes with stock Android 2.2 without any modifications by Motorola. The phone feels nice and responsive, apps and screen transitions are definitely more fluid than on my old Moto Droid. The battery life feels adequate, at least in my case. I don't stream a lot of media content, but for standard browsing and app usage, the charge easily lasts a full day. The AC adapter/USB cable is standard Motorola, additional chargers can be found very cheaply online.The Bad: Signal strength is very weak. I typically only get one or two bars. Consequently, upload and download speeds are much slower than what my Motorola Droid was capable of on Verizon's network. Online forums and reviews have led me to believe that this is an issue specific to the Triumph, and not indicative of Virgin Mobile's service. Call quality is acceptable, and I haven't dropped many calls in the month I've had the phone. So, it seems to do that well, even when only showing one bar. Your results may vary. The screen is difficult to see in direct sunlight, even with auto brightness enabled. Light leaks from where the screen meets the body of the phone. Lastly, the phone has been out for several months now, and the problems I've outlined seem to be very common. Motorola hasn't done anything to address or acknowledge the connectivity issues, and frankly, I don't think they intend to at this point.In summary, I would recommend Virgin Mobile as a service, but not the Triumph as a phone.

When I went to the pharmacy to pick up a prescription and I needed to contact the dr, the pharmacy gave me a fax number to call-- not a problem since it is easy to look up the number I need with the browser.  Finally, I see a point to using a gps device, I just look up the address I need on the internet, click on it, and am directed to the navigation program.  So cool.  When my children want Dunkin Donuts, I can look up the closest one and get there, easily.  And the Google Calendar was SO worth getting a gmail address.

I did open and activate the phone only to find out that it had almost all of the issues that other people had.  Light leakage in bottom left hand corner, gps would take at least 10 minutes to lock when it actually worked, black and white screen flicker when unlocking from idle, unresposive back button, unresponsive screen and  poor battery life. I was able to extend the battery life by downloading advanced task killer. The one area I didnt have any issues with was 3g speed seems I had a signal compairable if not better than the Rumor touch that I had previously. I never recieved a voice signal more than 2 bars however the only time I noticed any connection issues was when I was on the phone with Amazon. Which means I was probably speaking to a call center in another country which could have caused the poor reception. This phone has an awesome camera and the flash works great.  I did not expierence any blue tint to the screen as other mentioned.  It really is like playing russian ruelet when you buy this phone.

Once it locks the first time for the day it then starts locking within a minute.  No screen flickers to be seen.  No sudden reboots like the other one. The screen does however have a slightly blue tint when the brightness is turned all the way down.  The battery life is still horrible but this is to be expected with any smart phone from what I understand.  No problems with 3g connections and I have actually seen 3 bars on this one in places I barely got 1 bar on the other one. There is however a light leak on this one which is in the bottom corners on both the left and right sides but it is not as bright and noticible as the light leak on the other one.

Perhaps there was a batch of bad devices that slipped through - that would make me angry, too if I got one of those - but it does NOT make the Triumph a subpar phone.Quite the opposite:I replaced my Intercept with this phone and was a little leery about the absence of an actual keyboard.

The 5MP camera was a little disappointing at first, for a camera of that resolution I expected a little more. But then again - this is really not a camera per say with a much bigger optic and proprietary software etc. I downloaded an app (HDR+) which takes 3 or 4 pictures and then interpolates the pixels. Those pictures became so vibrant that I hat to play with the settings and tone it town a bit.I did miss the physical buttons the Intercept has at the beginning but that has faded now, too. A big gripe would be the awkward positioning of the power button - even for a right handed person with decent sized hands it is hard to push that button.

When reviewed using stock ROM, I'd have to say this is a 3.5-star phone because of those issues, and Motorola's decision to ignore those problems.Thankfully, the Android community doesn't let stuff like that go without fixing it, and so there are a few different custom ROMs to run on the Motorola Triumph. CM7 runs great, fixes the GPS issues, and grants all sorts of OS improvements that should have been there from the start. It does have some negatives, like taking time before they get around to implementing the HDMI port, and having minor issues with having both WiFi and Bluetooth running at the same time (major battery drain if you do this), but the gain in having a fully-working phone that can hit the GPS satellites, maintain call quality, make WiFi calls, do wireless tethering, and other improvements and upgrades is worth it, if you ask me.With CM7 installed, the phone is stable and performs like it should have out of the box. It's a little tricky getting it installed, but once you do it you'll be happy you picked up a Motorola Triumph. Add to that the fact that you can still use Virgin Mobile's super-cheap thirty-five dollar monthly plan to get 300 talk minutes plus unlimited data and texts, and you've got a winner here.Even if you do stick with stock Android, you'll be happy.

Honestly, this phone is great considering the competition on vm's lineup. I saw alot of negative reviews on this  website and I'm here to clerify a few issues. The screen is amazing, 4.1 inches with a responsive ambient light sensor make it easy on the eyes and nice for light reading and decent for viewing content. I've seen no \"blue hues\" as some people claim plague the handset. An issue like that is more likely to be a faulty handset not an issue seen on every product. I have had the device reset on me a few times while putting it through heavy use but if you think of the processor to ram specs this could be an issue on any device in its performance range (1ghz to 512 ram ratio). The form factor is mostly screen which makes sense with it being a touch screen phone. thats a good thing in my opinion sinse it's touch screen. No fluff, no problem. The physical button orientation can be a bit unnerving if youre use to the traditional android device configuration but grows on you quickly. This isnt a power house device that you would find on contract based companies, but it gives them a run for their money with its 5.0 megapixel camera with flash and front facing 1.3 megapixel cam. It cant run gameloft games, I cant stress that enough because thats the main difference. Other than that most of the specs make it a decent front runner for pre paid customers looking for a phone with good specs capable of keeping in par with top shelf phones.

This being pre-paid, of course the technology behind the phone is about 2 to 3 years old now, a solid 1Ghz single core processor, and 512mb of RAM, while current contract phones have moved on to dual core processors and 1gb of RAM. To get an idea, you could say that the Triumph is about on par with a iPhone 3gs.Physical design - For me, the Triumph teeters on the line between being too big and just right in size, anything larger is not practical for a phone, and anything considerably smaller would leave something to be desired. The Triumph is satisfyingly thin and light-weight, but the boxy design with it's rather large dimensions kind of make it a slightly uncomfortable phone to hold in your hand, despite the soft almost rubber-like material of the plastic. So far, I have not purchased a protective case for my phone. I strongly recommend that you do buy a protective case, as I can see how a phone of this size and shape would sustain some pretty catastrophic damage if dropped onto a hard surface. Unlike some other phones offered through Virgin, the Triumph only has three side buttons, a standard standby/power, and two media/ringer volume buttons. I was slightly disappointed to learn there was no physical button for shooting pictures. In addition, there is a standard headphones jack at the top, and a standard USB as well as a mini HDMI-out on the bottom. I've yet to use the HDMI-out function, as mini cable was not included and can be very expensive. The capacitive keys for menu, home, back, and search are a nice feature, but can occasionally lock up where they don't want to respond and you must tap the home key to regain full functionality. There are two speakers on each side and they can get pretty loud, the sound quality is pretty sharp.Screen - The screen is vibrant, colorful, pretty to look at. The resolution isn't as high as an iPhone, but is still the standard for any Android phone. The screen automatically adjusts levels of brightness to accommodate your needs by detecting the level of external light which is nice. There is a noticeable screen \"leak\" in the bottom left and right corners below the screen. For me, it's not a big deal at all. My only complaint would be that there is one tiny \"dead pixel\" on my screen, and a couple of small blotches behind the factory installed screen protector. Touch sensitivity is a little too rigid really, could have been a bit more responsive.Performance - The phone performs quiet well in every capacity. Apps and widgets are quick to load and install, games run nicely, web surfing is fast and smooth running even on non-mobile sites, videos run nicely without lag. Note that performance with any data related app will partially depend on Sprint's 3G service and coverage in your local area. The first three days I had the phone I also had problems with the GPS being very slow, soon after it began working much quicker, but still struggles to pinpoint your location from time to time. So not the greatest GPS, but with a little patience, it's fine. Unfortunately, app do crash occasionally, and have been doing so more often than when I first got the phone which is disappointing. I have on occasion experienced some general malfunctioning as well, such as the screen flickering green during a Youtube video. I've also woken up from standby to a washed out screen. I'm not sure what causes these issues, but they don't occur very often.Camera - Very disappointing for me. At the price point, I really expected a better camera. It's a 5 megapixel, apparently capable of shooting stills in 1080p, and video in 720p. You're offered a lot of resolutions in the settings and on the highest the still shots are good, but I wouldn't say great. Lots of light will greatly benefit a still shot, while dimmer locations will be less impressive. Perhaps the biggest let down of the phone for me is the camcorder. While the picture isn't bad, especially on the 720p resolution, it tends to suffer a lot from motion blur and lagging with a very low frame rate. In fact, a video shot in 720p will often result in 10fps, which is unacceptable. It's disappointing that the camera in the Triumph isn't up to par with my standard definition Canon from 2007 in that regard. A standard 30fps would have been nice. The mic in the camcorder is very quiet and muffled as you would expect with a typical camera phone, again very disappointing. I would have really liked the Triumph to have a overall good camera for $300, but I'm afraid it's very mediocre. The front facing cam is about on par with typical web cam quality.OS / pre-loaded apps - The phone comes pre-loaded with an outdated version of Android, 2.2. This doesn't make sense as 2.3 was already out when the Triumph was released, and now there's a 4.0. As far as I know, there is no \"official\" update as of yet, your only option is to install a custom ROM if you don't want 2.2. This particular Android is pretty straight forward, but of course there are at least a two or three apps on Virgin's end that most will find unnecessary or useless, and unfortunately they're hard to get rid of if you're not big on hacking your phone. The rest of the pre-installed apps are pretty much standard, except for the camera and gallery apps, which I'm not too fond of. I don't really like sloppy way the gallery mixes still shots with video, and doesn't seem to allow any sort of custom organization or editing. I also find that the zoom is horrible, you try to zoom into a still shot and it will just blur the image.Pros- Powerful and fast.- Quality screen/video.- Quality speakers/audio.- Forward and front facing cameras.Cons- Camcorder lacks tremendously.- GPS can flake out.- Android 2.2 has occasional hiccups and app crashing.- Capacitive keys freeze up.A very solid phone, and I'm going to stick with it until Virgin decides to release the LG Optimus Black , which stands to offer everything the Triumph does with a crisper LCD display and a much nicer 720p camera/camcorder.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3CMPFR0P2SHQG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is Virgin Mobile's best phone. A fast 1ghz processor works decent with 3g, great with wifi. The camera is good at 5 mega pixels. Internal memory is good at 2gigs to run android 2.2 without using all the memory and having to remove apps to free up space. I'm not sure if there is an updgrade to gingerbread 2.3 but 2.2 is reliable and works fine. I had the HTC wildfire S which has 2.3 but I do not notice a difference and the internal memory in the wildfire is horrible at 150 mb. The memory got so low(under 10mb), that I couldn't receive texts without clearing cache all the time. The only thing better on the htc was more effects for the camera.  The Motorola Triumph has a 4.1 inch screen which seemed too big at first but now I'm used to it and wouldn't go back to a smaller phone. Sometimes I have to tap the screen several times to click on an app for it to open. No phone is perfect although the expensive ones should be since they cost a lot. This phone would be better if it had an 8 megapixel camera. Hopefully Virgin Mobile's next flagship phone will. The battery if you use the touchscreen constantly to play games, wears down of course. In standby, talk and text it is better.  The screen size is great and clear to zoom in on pics and on websites. It's better to pay half as much prepaid unlimited everything than be stuck in a contract with verizon or another provider whose service and phones are not perfect either. Also I would recommend buying this phone through Amazon as you save $50 over buying it in stores or through Virgin Mobile. Slightly under $230 compared to $280. I've dropped this phone once without a hardshell case and it worked fine after. Fell several feet to the kitchen floor. I would recommend a hardshell case so not to risk breaking the phone.

Service has improved as has coverage and they have always provided a reasonable value for their product, especially compared with 2-year plan larger service providers such as Verizon and Virgin's parent company, Sprint Nextel. I have been through a number of phones throughout the years, most operating fine with an issue here or there, typically resolved with little difficulty. About a year ago Virgin go into the smartphone game aggressively, unveiling the Moto Triumph. Excited, I purchased it as a present to myself in November and enjoyed the product for about 8 or 9 months. By and large it worked well, though there were some software issues, especially with storage and GPS location, that have all been well documented on the web. By now, I am sure it's well understood what the pros and cons of this phone are. What people do need to consider is what happens when the phone begins to fail. From what I have seen around the web, the issue of the soldering on the charging port at the base of the phone has been poorly engineered. Consequently, after a certain degree of use, it begins to become flaky and phone will have trouble charging. There have also been ongoing issues with batteries unable to hold their charge.Anyways, in July my phone began to experience both issues. I contacted Virgin and they sent me a replacement phone. No problems yet. Then, about three weeks into owning the replacement phone, it began to exhibit the same problems that my old phone had. A week later and it would not turn on. Another replacement was sent. This time, when I received the phone, it would not turn on at all. Very frustrated, I wrote Virgin how upset I was. They immediately sent out a replacement battery and charger. A few days ago I received those, swapped everything out, tried the phone, and still nothing. It's clear that Virgin is dealing with a mass failing of this particular phone. Worse, their solution is to simply swap broken phones among customers until their 1-year warranty and they are left up s*** creek with no paddle. Of course, I contacted them again, very frustrated. They told me they would deal with this immediately.A few days passed, then I asked them what was going on - I had been paying for service now for the better part of the month without actually having a phone. They told me they could not send me another replacement (which I expressed concern about being just another dud, to which they dismissed my issues) until they had received my previous phone (that had been replaced with the phone which would not turn at all). I had sent that back a few days before. I explained how ridiculous this all was, considering I as the customer was sitting with my thumb up my a** waiting for all variety of broken phones to be flown back and forth across the country to kill time for their corporate regulatory purposes. Even better, my demands that I be recompensed for all these days of service I was paying for and not receiving was largely dismissed. Now, they have called my childhood home (I guess that was my additional phone number back in the days when I lived at home in high school 8 years ago) and threatened my parents that they would cancel service to my phone because I had failed to return a replaced device.Go ahead, Virgin, cut off access from a phone that won't even turn on, which was sent by your refurb department to layover a previously shuffled dysfunctional device. At this point, they have not only insulted me a stunning number of times, but also taken me for granted, and indicated that they think their customers (such as me) are fools and will fall for this phone shuffle. There is little they could possibly due to remedy this behavior and I have made it my duty to invest the time to relay this story and warn other prospective customers in as many forums of report as possible.

My understanding is that Google now owns Motorola. Maybe Google has stepped in to fix  the build problems with the early phones? It seems that way because I haven't found any deal breaker things wrong with the phone. The battery door stays firmly in place and the voice navigation works fine after gps gets locked on. The phone's 2 speakers are on the edges of the housing so there is less chance of their being muffled( with the Intercept's one rear facing speaker ringtones were often impossible to hear).

The phone feels in hand like it has a custom silicon case except better because it's not bulky.The Triumph also has a real, working notification LED that tells you if you have missed a call or received a text even when the screen is dark. It's great to get back this feature since you don't have to constantly paw at the phone to see if you've missed something. Why they took this feature off other phones is a mystery to me.The USB port(and also maybe the HDMI)is upside down so you have to be careful to not force the plug in the wrong way.

I bought a 2200ma battery from ebay and get about 12 hours of moderate use on one charge now.- Light seepage from lower left corner of screen.  For me this is only evident when I unlock the phone and only for a second at that.Overall. I would recommend this phone.  Do yourself a fwvor and spring the $15 for a aftermarket bayyery.

Here are some of the best pre-paid smart phones in the market.Virgin Mobile hit the ball out of the ball-park for me with its prepaid smart-phone. The Motorola isn't just sleek, it also comes packed with some nice features. The Motorola Triumph is thin, with a huge enough screen:Height4.8\"Width2.6\"Depth0.39\"Weight3.4 ozIt comes with 3G, Wi-Fi capable, Bluetooth 2.1, internal memory: 2GB, expandable memory: 32GB, 1GHZ Processor, Android 2.2 platform, RAM: 512 MB. It has 4 hours of battery life. It also features. It has dual Cameras, 5MP rear-facing and VGA front-facing. You can record and share HD videos in high quality 720p. It comes with an HDMI output. Record videos on your phone and watch them on your computer in HD.The Motorola triumph comes standard with several applications: Google maps, Google navigation-you can search for addresses, businesses, and landmarks and get directions to your destination. You can also view real-time traffic conditions and navigate hands-free using spoken, turn-by-turn driving directions. It comes with a YouTube app and a free Virgin Mobile live app which allows you to stream music.The plans are affordable:The phone is fast and rarely drops calls. The only disadvantage I found is that there is no update to 2.3 platform which would allow you to video chat via its `Google talk' app and the speaker is low when playing videos. Other than that the Motorola triumph is a sleek beauty.Virgin Mobile has some affordable plans:$35/Month, free web, data messaging and email with 300 minutes$45/Month, unlimited web, data  messaging and email with 1200 minutes$55/month, unlimited web, data messaging,email and unlimited talk.review by: John thuko.

I've owned this phone now for about a month & I must say, it's one of the best phones I've had so far! It has it's moments, but so does the iphone! Honestly, I'd pick an android over the iphone any day. I feel too limited when I use iphones. Sometimes, the motorola triumph does lag a bit, & occasionally freeze, but it doesn't really bother me. The design is flawless & I love how sleek & skinny it is. Now, here's a few things that DO bother me. First, I was so excited when I heard it comes with a front facing camera; until I saw how crappy the quality was. The main camera is 5mp, not bad. But the front is only 2mp & I have to say I was very disappointed with that. I also hoped the front facing camera would AT LEAST have LED flash capability, but sigh. Another let down. Another thing that bothered me was the sound quality. Music is my life. So when I uploaded a few songs onto the device, I was so excited; but once again let down by the horrible muffle sounding quality. I mean, with a phone this high up, you'd expect a decent clear sound. But that's pretty much it for the negatives. I primarily use the phone for texting, internet & the camera.

During the decision process to buy that phone, read all the 1 star, and 5 star reviews for this phone, but decided on the OV due to the cheaper price.  As fate would have it on Cyber Monday Virgin had the Moto Triumph on sale for $120.00 with a coupon code, which I could not resist.  Am using both now and have only ONE issue with the Moto T, the GPS.  When comparing directly (from cold start) to the Optimus V, the Optimus is literally GPS ready within 10 seconds of finishing booting, whereas the Moto seems to take quite a bit longer.  There DOES seem to be a trick to getting it to acquire (lock) quickly, which I am still working on.  When using only GPS Test (app) it seems to take longer, as opposed to just choosing \"navigate\" (phone function) and letting it acquire.  It is def. nowhere as fast as the Optimus, so if GPS is a major concern the Optimus wins.  I did notice on the Optimus that due to the smaller screen some icons had jagged edges, using web pages were more laborious (zooming), but on the Triumph everything is bigger, no icons with jagged edges, less scrolling.  The processor is very snappy, games, movies, menu navigation, etc.  Right now I am using Go Launcher EX, with Classic Blue 1.0 theme, along with the BatStat app, and the Sense Analog (dark) clock and it looks razor sharp.  Either the Optimus or the Triumph will have to go back, and I'm leaning towards keeping the Moto Triumph even with the minor GPS lock issues.  The phone has had NO other issues I read about on some of the earlier ones including any screen flickering, touch screen innacuracies, restarts, etc.  Just the GPS issue.  Please note both phones are on WiFi only, so no 3G signal comparisons could be done.  Because I have GPS units in my vehicles, having to wait a bit longer to get the GPS to lock on the Motorola was not a big deal breaker.  Also please note, the slow GPS lock was from a cold boot, and/or GPS disabled/enable, and once it locked it stayed locked with no issues.  Realizing I paid less than half price during Cyber Monday at Virgin, with the full price being what it is, the buyer will have to decide if a slower GPS lock is worth it or not.

I bought this phone primarily to escape my contract. My wife and I were on a Sprint family plan, with 1200 anytime minutes and unlimited any-mobile-to-mobile through Sprint. This was roughly $140 base, plus $10 data charge (per line) and taxes/fees/etc ($160 /mo total). I had a been a Sprint customer for 6 years and would have stuck around if the price was comparable to Virgin.Network Coverage-----------I have the same amount of coverage and can not tell any difference between Virgin & Sprint. Interestingly, the Virgin website claimed I was in a 'limited' coverage area - however, since my Sprint service was rock solid, I took the leap and have had no issues.Triumph----------I love the phone. It reminds me of what the \"Razr\" would be if it was still in production. The screen is big and really nice to look at ~ the rest of the phone is metal coated in a black rubberized finish (which i love). The phone has a bit of weight to it, which is something I like ~ it feels substantial, like the Rolex I daydream about.I only have one gripe and that is the bluetooth. I previously owned a Sprint LG Optimus S Android Cell Phone (Black) and used my earpiece (Motorola H17 Bluetooth Headset (Black)) religiously. With the Optimus, I would flip open the boom on the H17 and it would pair nearly instantly. On the Triumph, pairing is very spotty. I frequently have to turn off bluetooth and turn it back on to make it pair. I also notice the range on the bluetooth is not nearly as good. With the Optimus I could leave my phone in the kitchen and walk about my entire house. With the Triumph, it seems I only have about a 20' radius I can stay within, before it starts to break up.Overall----------I love the phone.

The reality of this means that there will be different experiences for different people and uses.Out of the box, there are no issues I can find. There is no lag in the display (unless one starts to use it right after turning it on, like most desktop computer systems, the GUI is available before everything is finished loading), and scrolling through the apps menu is consistent and responsive throughout the entire menu and it still is. The only lag I can find would be in individual applications, but that is really the application which needs to be judged. The specs of this phone are what they are. I do not play games on it and so I have not explored the limitations of the hardware in that regard.The connectivity is better than my old Virgin Mobile phones (Samsung Intercept and LG Optimus V). In those, I had to power cycle more often to get things working properly, but the Triumph works well without power cycling. I can count on having a good signal and am able to watch Youtube and Flash videos on websites (with Opera Mobile) with no waiting usually.The large display is the reason why I bought it however. I use my phone frequently for the Internet and the large display coupled with the good network connectivity have left my very satisfied.And, as I am prone to do with expensive things I own, I have already dropped it while it was in the case I have clipped to my belt (unclipped at the time, but the phone was in it).

On the whole I was impressed with the LG Optimus V and with VM's service (and price).  My LG has withstood quite a bit of abuse, but a couple of weeks ago it took a tumble out of my pocket and into 4 inches of standing water.  The still worked--but it hasn't been quite right since (it randomly dials people and the touch screen is not working well).  So, time to buy a new phone.  I was torn between getting another Optimus V (on sale for $125 at Target) or picking up a Triumph $300 at target, but it came with a $50 target gift card.  Despite some of the reviews on line, I decided to give the Triumph.Although there are a lot of complaints about this phone including: flickering screens, light leakage from the screen, poor touch response, poor bluetooth connectivity, poor cell reception and 3g performance, I can't say I have experiences any of these issues in the three weeks that I have had this phone.  For the most part, I would say the wifi reception, 3g reception and voice performance is on par with the Optimus V.  It is true that, where the Optimus would show a 4 bar signal reception, the Triumph might show 3 (I have my wife's optimus for comparison), but I have not seen any real world difference in performance.  It's no secret that manufacturers can play with the devices to show stronger signals that the device actually has (iPhone 4 anyone???) and that may be the case here.  On the whole the phone is much snappier than the Optimus.  The Optimus would get bogged down a bit on Angry Birds once you hit the second round of level--not the case at all with the Triumph.  The Optimus struggles to handle video streaming from HBO Go, Max Go and Netflix--the Triumph has no such issue.  The larger size screen is a definite improvement on the Optimus as is the bump in resolution.  However, the viewing angles on the Triumph are just ok and the screen is really just an average TFT LCD display.  Don't get this phone expect Samsung Galaxy Super AMOLED or Apple Retina Display-type performance.  It's just not happening.  Believe it or not, the biggest improvement I have noticed is the bump from 756 ROM to 2gig.  I would constantly run out of memory on the optimus because, even when you move apps to the  micro SD card, some memory remains on the phone.  When you only have 40mb to of space to work with, you really can't have many apps on the phone.  The Optimus is really limited in the number and size of the apps it could handle.  The Extra 1.5 gigs of available space on the Triumph makes a huge difference.In terms of battery life, that depends a lot on how you use the phone.  It doesn't have the battery life of the Optimus by any stretch, but it's not terrible.  It's a typical smart phone.  It has enough juice to get the average user through the work day and you have to plug it in every night.  If you're a heavy user, you may find that you're getting down to 25% by the end of the work day.  If you a task killer and a battery saver app, you should be able to get through a full day.  It would help to have a spare battery, but for some reason it's harder to find extra batteries for the Triumph than for other phones (I picked up 4 spares for the Optimus for $4 each).Call quality on the phone is good--about the same as the optimus.  3g speeds vary by location--but overall performance is about the same on 3g with the Triumph and Optimus.  Wifi is actually better on the Triumph--the snappier processor makes a big difference here.I wish the Triumph had Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), a sharper screen and better battery life, but for a pre-paid smart phone, it is currently the best one on the market.  The LG Optimus Black (probably a different name when it hits VM) may be a better phone--at least a better screen and better battery life, but it isn't available yet.  Even when it does hit VM, it is using an older TI OMAP 3620 processor.  The Qualcomm Scorpion, with Adreno 205 GPU in the triumph is a much better chipset (same as the LG Revolution and HTC Thunderbolt).  There's give and take as with anything.

Lg's rumor was so good to me that i didnt feel the need to upgrade when the lg optimus v and samsung intercept android phones came out.  But when the bigger screen, android-based, triumph was announced i knew it was time to move on.  After only 2 wks of heavy usage this is just my take on my 1st smartphone and 2nd android-based device.I really like...*  The  4.1 inch screen.  It was the main selling point to me and it looks great.  The screen is very responsive for me too.  I still have the thin screen protector that i think you are supposed to take off but i decided to keep it since the capacitive screen works fine with it on.*  The rubbery feel of the cell.  Some would say its cheap feeling, but i like the better grip/no fingerprints aspect to this.*  Access to android market.  Lots of cool or useful apps.*  The ability to use your mp3s as ringtones.  I thought i would need an app for this but the pre-installed music player has you set out of the box.  I also love being able to set up playlists(this was my main gripe about the rumor touch).  The mp3s sound loud too from two small speakers on the lower bottom.*  The built in camera.  It takes pretty good pics and videos for the most part.  Videos(720p hd) i think could be smoother though.*  Netflix and youtube.  Both work fine usually.  I have occasional buffering at times but most of the time they play smoothly.*  Great to be able to access full sites instead of mobile versions.  I know there are plenty of apps for the mobile sites, but i just bookmark the full sites and specific pages.  The full sites look microscopic at times even on the 4\"screen but in landscape mode and with pinch and zoom options most people should be fine.*  Setting up email accounts was easy.  Also, transferring my account from my touch to the triumph was even easier.  You can activate online from virgin mobiles website or on the phone itself.  All the money, minutes, and my $25 status was kept intact.*  3G & wifi-enabled options- best of both worlds.  2gb micro sd card/case/adapter included with support for up to 32gb cards.  Hdmi output also a plus.What i dont like...*  Im a big texter so the touchscreen keyboard is killing me.  Ive gotten better and faster but i miss the slideout keyboard on my rumor touch.*  The back battery cover can get loose.  Im not a case/shell person and i like to keep my cell in my pocket.  So if it rubs up against your pockets or something over time it might cause it to loosen and come off.  However ive never had it come loose by just holding it extensively for calls or browsing.*  Like others, the battery really gets drained pretty fast on mine.  Im in the \"barely gets a days usage\" group.  If i use it heavily i have to charge it twice.  I have bluetooth and wifi turned off too.  It does charge back up pretty fast though imo.  Btw i havent installed any app killers.  But if i know i wont use the 3G internet option for awhile, i just turn it off(settings, wireless networks, mobile networks, uncheck data enabled)  to save the battery life.*  Speaking of which, like others i only seem to get 1-2 bars out of 4 for the 3G service.  However, that seems to be just enough for anything i want to do on the internet.  As mentioned earlier, i sometimes have some buffering issues with youtube and netflix but im not sure if its a 3G or website issue.  For the record i have seen 4 bars on my triumph before, when i was in midtown.*  On rare occasions i will find the back button or touchscreen a bit unresponsive at times, about a second or two.  Im thinking they have to do more with the apps/software side than the triumphs hardware.  If you have ever read reviews about android 2.2 from android fans, apparently it can get buggy at times.  I knew this going in so a few seconds here and there doesnt bother me.  But make no mistake, most of the time the screen/buttons are buttery smooth like it should be.*  No offense to virgin mobile, but i tried all their VM-related pre-installed apps once...then deleted them off the homescreen.  I didnt care for them at all.Finally, im afraid i dont have wifi at home yet, am not a big fan of facebook/myspace, and dont plan on using this as a gps system so i cant comment on those features.  Most reviews ive read though seem to say the gps function is not that good.  *shrugs*Overall i really like this cell.  For $25/35 a month(maybe free if you got wifi) you can have a mini- tablet of sorts with unlimited data, unlimited texts, and 300 minutes of talk.  300 is not a lot, but with unlimited texting, social networking with unlimited data, and free skype calls(calls work for me but i cant get the video option to work)  to help out, most peple shoud be fine on the lowest cost plan.  In the past i was jealous of my friends smartphones.  But those costly contracts always scared me away.  So im glad VM finally added the triumph to its optimus and intercept line-up....and that lg rumor touch aint too bad either.  Definitely recommended if you are in the virgin mobile coverage area and are tired of those costly contract (albeit cool)cell phones.Note:  target is offering a $50 gift card with purchase 9-4 through 9-10-11 if you cant find one cheap online.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good prepaid phone on stock ROM - Awesome prepaid phone on custom ROM", "Author": "James Barkman \"James E.

It runs smoothly and I'm happy about my purchase. Keeps up pretty well with a friend's Motorola Atrix, though it's certainly not faster.Alos, the build quality of this phone is top notch. Soft touch alround, Gorilla Glass front, metal back. And really quite slim. The biggest issue I have with the body is that the battery cover is almost too easy to get open - it sometimes comes off when I pull it out of my pocket. Though this is easily fixed with a case.Camera quality is great outdoors in even sunlight, but terrible most of the time indoors and in dark enviroments. The flash does help though. 720p video looks good on the screen, but not the best blown up. Again, it's much better outdoors in good, even sunlight. The front-facing camera, at VGA resolution, is crap. But still good for video chat. And the bonus of Gingerbread is that you can actually use it for video chat on Skype.The screen is gorgeous, bright, and crisp. It's no qHD, but it looks as good as the screen on the Droid 3 or Droid Bionic. At 4.1 inches it's a perfect size, and not so big as to make it an uncomfortable phone to hold.The biggest let down of this device is the battery life though. It is improved by CM7, but it's still a bit lacking. An extra batter and external charger solved the issue quite well, however.Some problems that CM7 solves are: screen flickering when waking device, random reboots, sound quality, it gives you Wi-Fi Hotspot support, and so many other things. Not to mention you can tweak the appearance to your heart's content. As far as UI goes, you can't tell the difference between the one on my Triumph and the one on the DroidX/DroidX2.Again, this a good prepaid Froyo handset, but, with the right modifications, it's an awesome prepaid Gingerbread handset.

I tolerated all the chiding from my friends about my enormous clunky phone because in the end I was paying a 3rd of their monthly plans. Let's face it, we all got into Virgin Mobile because it was the cheapest plan out there, not because we were the trendiest people (those guys buy a new iPhone each year).If you're like me you figured that one day you would upgrade your phone. After a lot of research I figured I would pick up the Virgin Mobile HTC ONE V when it dropped at the end of this summer (according to rumors). Unfortunately Virgin Mobile recently announced a policy change whereby IF YOU SWAP YOUR PHONE AFTER 5/27/2012 YOU MUST UPGRADE TO THEIR NEW SERVICE PLAN/PRICE. If you are one of the lucky people to get in on their $25/month plan (less if you buy your refills online with coupons/discounts) then to keep being grandfathered in at that price you must upgrade now.The choice came down to the MOTOROLA TRIUMPH or the much lauded OPTIMUS V. I suggest stopping by your local Target so you can fondle the different phones. Ultimately the screen size of the Triumph won out for me. I was a little worried after reading the Triumph's review here - I read a handful of 5 star reviews and then almost all the 1 star reviews. The gist of most negative reviews talks about spotty service, difficulty switching over, and poor battery life.Well, I figured I had better order the Triumph now so that I could address all these concerns before the 5/27/2012 deadline. CONCERN 1: \"Spotty Service\" - I live in Northern Virginia, about 30 minutes outside of DC. So far my service is fantastic. Last night I was surfing the internet on my phone on the lower level of a 3 story townhouse while it was thunder-storming outside! My Intercept won't even connect to the web when it rains! Sure the Triumph isn't as fast as a direct connect, but it does a fairly good job - and having tried the WiFi at some of my local shops, it almost is as good as a direct connect! CONCERN 2: \"difficulty switching over\" - okay, this was a concern for me too, I hate calling Virgin Mobile and t-a-l-k-i-n-g s-l-o-w-l-y because the guy on the other end would rather not be speaking English - well if you log into your Virgin Mobile account, on the right-side menu there is an option for PHONE SWAP! About 4 steps later you should be done. Well no. I didn't realize there was a lag and for about 5-10 minutes I was completely without a usable mobile device. In a fit of panic I tried to call VM's 800 number, but neither the INTERCEPT or the TRIUMPH would work! Well shortly after that I received an email from my account saying the swap was successful and low and behold they were right - maybe what was taking so long was that they were porting all my phone numbers over. CONCERN 3: \"poor battery life\" - there are several apps for this, and if you are careful with your settings (i.e. screen brightness, timeouts, vibration functions) you can easily get more than a day's use out of your phone. Since I have a charger on my desk at home and at work, this is a non-issue for me.PROS*Screen is huge compared to the Intercept!*Screen is much more responsive than the Intercept!*Phone is faster than the Intercept*Swapping over was a piece of cake and did not involve a call to India or the Philipines*Camera is fantastic and unlike the Intercept the Triumph actually has a decent flashCONS*I miss the Intercept's keyboard, even though the touchscreen on the Triumph is big enough to avoid most mispellings*The phone feels a little more delicate than the Intercept - I'm worried about how it would handle a fall*The battery cover is a pain in the b*tt to take off and put on; thank goodness you only have to do this when upgrading the memory cardOn the whole I am very happy with my upgrade. Some folks have complained about their phones resetting or acting splotchy, but 9/10 times this is due to some software conflict with whatever they've been downloading. I really recommend the Triumph and suggest anyone that was sitting on the fence like me hurry up and buy it before you are locked in with your old phone, if you're like me, $23.80 a month for phone, internet, data, and texting is a deal I don't want to give up any time soon!", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Triumph is as good as it gets with Virgin Mobile", "Author": "Joey Troy", "ReviewID": "R2DB7UHYVL1441", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I have read and watched all the reviews on this phone before I popped for it. This is the first cell phone I have purchased since 2004. Since then I have always had company provided cell phones (Motorola Q, BlackBerry this and that, flip phones, and other Windows Mobile devices). This is the second Android phone I have used. My Wife has the Samsung Intercept. It's a decent phone but I didn't like using it the times I messed with it. It always seemed very hard to find stuff. So getting into the Android OS has been a change since I own both an iPod touch and an iPad.After activating the phone I decided it's time to root the phone and get full control of my device. I mean hey being a techie I like taking all my devices to the next level. So after rooting it and following some very easy instructions off YouTube I reloaded the OS with MIUI which is a Chinese port of Android that has been ported to work on this phone, version 1.9.30 at the time of this post. Since reloading the phone I have had a few issues but nothing major to complain about. I have had a few lock ups using the Video Recorder but again these are things you sacrifice when not using the normal Virgin Mobile load.My first overview of the phone is I simply couldn't be happier with it. After getting all my email, facebook, and chess dot com application setup I have been extremely satisfied with the phone. It keeps my up to date on all those things and works like a dream. Size wise it reminds me of the Motorola Q. For being on Virgin Mobile it's the best device they offer, and works well. It may not be perfect since I have rooted the phone but it's part of the pro's and con's of pushing your device in this manner. However the biggest plus is I don't have to listen to the stupid Virgin Mobile boot screen anymore so to me it's worth it. If your like my (cheap) and can't see spending more than $35 (+$5 for insurance) a month on having a cell phone, then you just can't go wrong! I will post more updates in a month since I have only used the phone for about 72 hours.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Motorola Triumph should NOT have been released in its current state", "Author": "Hellfire99X", "ReviewID": "R2YGKWFQ5KPRRX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "A word of warning: This was my first ever smartphone purchase. However, I did a lot of research beforehand, and made an informed purchase of the Triumph hoping that the flaws I'd read about from pre-release buyers were minor. Sadly, they weren't.I picked up this phone from Best Buy on release date, July 20th, despite the fact that I was out of town on vacation. After giving it nearly a month's worth of usage, I ended up returning it on August 17th for two very big problems. For this review, I'll list the two deal-breaking issues I had, plus the phone features that impressed me, and will sum up my thoughts at the end. I'll begin with the bad stuff:- The 3G reception on the Triumph was just miserable. My entire town has 3G coverage according to Virgin Mobile's coverage map, yet this phone had a hard time maintaining a web connection from anywhere in town. What prompted me to finally return it is that I borrowed a family member's iPad 2, which runs on AT&T;'s 3G network, and did some DSLReports speedtesting. The iPad was quick to connect -- the lowest speed that the iPad posted was 600 kbps, with most of the rest in the 1000-1200 kbps range. In side-by-side tests, the Motorola Triumph had trouble even loading the website, and the few speedtests it posted were below 100 kbps -- the lowest being a pitiful 28, which I took a picture of. Remember, dial-up is 56!To be fair, over the course of the month the Triumph would occasionally post an 1100 kbps result, proving it was capable. Most of the time it just... didn't. I'm baffled as to why.- The GPS reception was poor, as well. I'm talking about satellite-only GPS here -- I'm aware that one can allow the phone to \"cheat\" by letting it connect to nearby wifi, to determine its location. Still, that's cheating, and I don't like connecting to hotspots without a good reason. No, satellite GPS should be fully functional... but on the Triumph, it barely was. Be prepared to wait 5-10 minutes for it to \"find\" a satellite, especially in a car. Time to grab a burger!Occasionally it'd pick up the sat in a snap, meaning I'd nearly drop my burger in shock... however, I found this to be a rare exception. Even placing the phone on my car's dashboard for a few minutes didn't help -- about the only thing I didn't try was rolling down the window and holding it outside, which would be ridiculous. Who would want to do that?!Now, for the good parts!+ The wifi on the Triumph is great! It was able to connect and maintain wifi connections without any hiccups, which made it fantastic for watching Youtube, streaming music, and browsing websites at hotels or at home. It did have a couple quirks, such as not usually connecting to a security-enabled wifi on its own in the background -- I'd have to open the wireless settings page and rest on it for about 15 seconds for it to go, \"Oh hey, I should be connecting!\" Minor quirks aside, the wifi on this thing was amazing, way better than my netbook's. I'll give it an A here.+ This phone runs Adobe Flash. In my regular usage, I found Flash playback to be very stable and fast -- no performance issues that I saw. If you want to run Flash on a wifi connection, this phone will do it very nicely. The only thing I couldn't get it to do was play live video streams from Justin.tv... not quite sure why. Flash will be the other thing I'll miss about this phone.My final thoughts: the Triumph is great for doing all kinds of stuff through a wifi connection. However, buyer beware: the Triumph has serious 3G and GPS issues, and there's been no official word from Motorola acknowledging the problems or any fixes. I've told friends this: it feels like Motorola forgot they were designing this as a smartphone until 3 months prior to release, and on a tight budget they rushed to outsource the 3G and GPS bits. This device is the result. Motorola... please fix these problems! I want the Triumph to work properly, and I want to recommend it to my friends!For comparison's sake, I've since picked up an LG Optimus V and have been testing the 3G and GPS for about a week now. The Opty's 3G generally pulls between 300-900 kb/s and doesn't have any major issues I've noticed, though while on the move between towers it'll occasionally drop out, say, a live music stream. (I expect that, and I won't be using the phone for 3G music-streaming anyway.) The Opty's GPS is fantastic, usually able to lock a satellite in less than 5 seconds, and it has my location pinpointed within a minute at most -- even through some buildings!Somehow I doubt that Virgin Mobile's 3G coverage has drastically changed, or that the GPS sats were all magically fixed recently -- which further reinforces my conclusion that the Triumph is very flawed. If you want a nice Android pocket-tablet, it's great for that. If you want a 3G phone with GPS, save yourself the trouble, do not buy the Triumph until Motorola fixes it.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad Phone", "Author": "DBiker", "ReviewID": "RJZJ7MRH7RKO3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "On paper, this phone is supposed to offer a lot.The only problem is that the quality is very poor.I went through three of these phones before giving up on it.Problems include:-Crummy GPS-Buggy interface-Battery cover that slips off-Lousy display (that cracked internally without dropping applying extreme pressure)I know this phone is, for all intents and purposes, obsolete.

You can tell Motorola just threw a bunch of Frankenstein parts together to make a cheap prepaid phone.-phone is slowwwwww and so is the data. People on the other end can't hear me. My phone freezes in between toggling texts.-battery life is abysmal. I'd say 3 hours talk time vs their advertised 4.-too many background tasks and this phone goes insane and sometimes does not turn back on.-the headphone and audio software and chipset is greatly faulted. This is well documentd. The volume is very low unless you make a phone call before plugging your headphones in and play music. So ridiculous for a $300 phone! I'm considering buying a used iPod to listen to music bc my phone that should do this well does not!- many tiny misc bugs you'll notice after using this phone for a while. I cannot wait to get rid of it.Stay far far away from this phone if you want a reliable working phone with an ounce of quality in it.

Full disclosure - this is my first smart-phone. But I am starting to hear many, many people complain about having an iPhone but being locked into an $80/month contract. Look, if you like to text, call, run any of the popular apps and occasionally browse the internet - especially if you have a wi-fi router in your house - this is a great phone. With Virgin Mobile's $35/month and NO CONTRACT plan it's almost a steal. I have had plenty of contract laden folks do a double take when they see what the phone can do and find out how much I'm paying a month. If you're a serious data user, this might not be the phone for you, but then again you'd probably already know that. But for the average Joe or Jane just looking to get into the smart-phone game I would recommend the Triumph.I have had to do about 4 battery-out resets, which have solved every software glitch or frozen screen that comes up. From what I hear that isn't the best, but it isn't altogether uncommon, either. Especially when you rarely if ever turn off your phone. Sometimes the 3G speed isn't lightning fast on its own, but then again I find myself around wireless hotspots more often than I realized. I do heavy surfing from those, including the one in my house, and the speed is just fine. I've never had a dropped call on this phone. Battery life...eh, it's a smartphone. Before you go to bed, plug the damn thing in and it's charged in the morning - it'll get you through the day. I believe it comes with an HDMI cord which you can use as a USB connector or a wall outlet charger (with included adapter). I have a desk job and I keep it charged all day through my work computer using that USB cord.Make sure to grab the free video chat app Tango, as it works well on this phone. The phone has plenty of room for those apps, too. Tune-In Radio works great, as does Google Sky, Words with Friends, et.al.I still am amazed that people who actually do less with their smart-phones than I do with this one are paying what they pay a month. If those people can get over their embarrassment, they should consider switching when their contract is up to VM. I've never had anything but positive experiences when I've had to talk to them directly. Yeah, they do try for their \"cool\" vibe a little too much, but don't let that turn you off. Saving $40-50 a month, still getting pretty good service and being able to switch whenever you want will always be cool.And with the Triumph, you are getting a high end phone for a budget price.

If I use the phone a lot during the day (streaming a few hours of radio, browsing the web, downloading apps etc.) then I need to charge it each night. With light use (an hour of streaming radio, less than half an hour online) the phone will need to be charged every 2 to three days. I do have a couple of apps like Juice Defender that help preserve battery life. Overall though the phone allows a ton of customization for people who like to geek out on their phones. The screen is a good size and it's got decent speed for games etc. Overall I've been really happy with the phone and the $35 dollar a month plan has been perfect as I make most of my calls at home over wifi (after paying for an app called grooveIP) so the 300 minutes hasn't been a problem. I would highly recommend this phone for people in the market for a solid android phone on a prepaid plan.

Being one of the first Android phones for the prepaid market I can understand that it is going to lag behind its contract phone competitors. I like the the Android OS that came prepackaged and the 3g coverage in my area is nice. I like being able to watch Netflix movies or listen to radio.com. Certainly the OS could be improved, but it's still nice out of the box. As for service, that depends on where I am. Frankly anyone getting any cell phone should check the coverage area and ask around before spending the money. I have noticed that sometimes the buttons do not respond. I assume this is because there are too many programs running in the background. I am constantly shutting them off, but they find a way to restart themselves! Another issue that I have is with the placement of the camera button and the use of a touchscreen button at that! For those that don't have this phone, the camera button (when you select the camera option) comes up at the bottom of the screen along with several other buttons for options. Now, this camera takes decent mobile photos for a camera in its price range, but I find the location of button very awkward. It is hard to get a stable image when you are both trying to press a touch screen button and stabilize the phone as well. I think a better option would have been an actual button on the top sides of the body. Also the location of the end call touch screen button makes it easy to accidentally hang up with your cheek.

I agree with other reviewers who have complaints about the GPS.  It seems to work well sporadically.  The first time I used the navigation it took about 1 minute to lock in my position - since then I have tried 4 other times and gave up on waiting each time after 5 minutes.  The Optimus has a great GPS, so that is a disappointment to me, but not the end of the world.  I have not had any problems with reception.  It works in my office where people have issues with their iphones, so I am happy with the reception.I definitely recommend downloading Swype Beta.

However, this phone with it's 1Ghz snapdragon processor is finally a good replacement for the HTC Evo I've been using for the last 18 months.  I won't say that it's perfect, but I have about 90% of the functionality of the EVO and a cell phone bill that is more than half off the monthly amount I used to pay.The major downside of the Triumph is that there aren't any extended batteries available yet.  The EVO battery life wasn't great either, but I purchased a Seidio Innocell 3500 mAh Extended-Life Battery which doubled the battery life of the EVO, so I could use it all day.  The Triumph really has to be charged at least once during the day to make it through an entire day.Also, I've received some feedback from people I've called that the speakerphone isn't as clear on the Triumph as it was on my EVO.Other than those two issues, the phone has performed very well.  I did experience some random reboots on the first couple of days, but I haven't seen that happen since then.To remedy the battery life issue (and until there's a better option available), I just purchased a New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 11000mAh External Battery Pack and Charger for iPad2, iPad, iPhone 4S 4 3Gs 3G (AT&T; and Verizon), iPod Touch (1G 2G 3G 4G 5G), HTC Android EVO, Blackberry, Samsung Galaxy S, Droid, Nintendo, Sony PSP and much more, which I've read will give up to a week of use on a phone like this.UPDATE: I returned my phone to Amazon today and replaced it with an LG Optimus Slider.  The LG Optimus Slider specs aren't anywhere near as good as the Motorola Triumph and the screen is smaller, but at least it's reliable.  I've only returned a handful of products to Amazon over the years, so for me to return this phone, it had to be bad.  The main problems I found are as follows:1. Random reboots.  The phone just reboots itself sometimes for no reason at all.  I was able to live with this because it wasn't that bad, even though it was annoying.2. Speakerphone microphone isn't clear, so callers are unable to hear you clearly when using speakerphone.  I always used speakerphone on my Evo, but never could use it on the Triumph, so I opted for bluetooth instead (see below)...3. Bluetooth is unreliable.  I tried to give this phone the benefit of the doubt literally for 2 weeks.  I was using an older Jawbone Prime, so I figured, maybe the bluetooth was randomly disconnecting because I needed to upgrade.  So, I purchased the Jawbone ICON from Amazon - same issue.  Then I purchased the LG bluetooth headset and same problem.  Turns out that bluetooth issues with this phone are a known issue.  If you google Motorola Triumph Bluetooth Issues, you'll see what I mean.  I was hoping there was a fix out there; I even considered rooting, but found out that there's no way around this issue.  Bluetooth will work for awhile (maybe 1 or 2 calls) and then won't work again until you turn off bluetooth in settings and turn it back on.  The bluetooth issue is what prompted me to return the phone.  I've been using the LG Optimus Slider for just a day now and it is so nice not having to worry about whether my bluetooth will work on the next call.4. Battery life is awful.  I was going to try living with this.  I know battery life on smartphones in general is not that great.  I'd hoped there would be an extended battery available for this phone eventually, but the phone just simply couldn't go more than 12 hours without a recharge.

The Camera on the Triumph is a 5mp one but the quality wasn't as great as it could have been. I can also record in 720p which i liked, the playback was a little laggy but that might have been because of the slow memory card preinstalled with the phone.

The camera takes really crisp pictures and video is a bit shaky but suitable for a camera phone.The only problem that I have experienced is sometimes when I am on the app screen it is slow to respond.

Upgraded from my horrible Samsung Intercept which I had for 18 months.  I approached this purchase with a lot of trepidation due to the schizo nature of the reviews - either loved it, or they hated it.  So far, I love it except for the battery life and sometimes slow GPS acquisition.  I will post an UPDATE after a few weeks or if I encounter problems.One of the reviewers wrote that a lot of the problems are due to conflicts between apps, so I've only loaded a few apps: Google Gestures (incredible app!!!) and its accompanying Gestures Bar; Google Voice; Yahoo Mail & GPS Test.  So far, no aut-reboots.  I'm keeping track of the apps I install & when in case one of them causes  problems.BATTERY LIFE - not great.  After 11 hr 39 min of up time the RED LED light came on - battery status showed 8% battery remaining.8% remaining @ 11 hr 39 min6% @ 12hr6min3% after 12hr45.1% after 13hr30auto powered off due to drained battery @ 13:32.I let the battery run out to test the life & to condition it.  I've ordered a 2000 mah battery from eBay which should run a lot longer than the stock 1380 mah battery.  Battery status showed for my usage, the GPS caused the most battery drain:- Google Maps (i.e. GPS) = 40%- Cell Standby = 30%- Cell Idle = 21%  (wonder what's the diff between standby & idle??)- Display 6% - generally used a medium brightness unless in bright sunlight, then used max brightness.  I do not use the Auto Brightness feature but control the brightness with the Power Widget that allows control of the brightness, & lets you turn on/off the Bluetooth; GPS; Synching; & WiFi from a homescreen toolbar- WHERE app, which uses GPS = 4%NOTE about the WHERE APP - I set the phone to NOT use my LOCATION in the apps, but WHERE used it anyway.  I only used the WHERE app to look at the weather, then 10 min later, I noticed that the GPS was STILL RUNNING because of the WHERE app even when I was in a diff app!!!  Google Map stops the GPS signal acquisition when you change to a diff app, but WHERE did NOT.  In that short 10min of \"use\", the WHERE app used up 4% of my battery life! Fortunately the WHERE app has an EXIT app option as the phone does not have a task manager.GPS - sometimes slow to acquire - a couple of minutes; sometimes less than a minute.  I was usually moving.  I used the GPS TEST app to see the signal strengths and saw that generally, the phone was able to receive strong signals from at least 4 or 5 satellites and often as 8 to 10 satellites. This indicates the Google Map app is the slow factor.  IF I stand still, signals are much faster to acquire & show my location.  NOTE -some wrote that it didn't work at home - GPS signals don't generally go through walls.  Try it by a window with a clear sky view.  This is true for all GPS devices.PLUSES ++++ great screen+ great VM service plan prices+ light+ not too much bloatware+ fast enough for the price+ good amount of internal memory unlike my Intercept that kept running out of memory+ Camera seems good as are the videos.+ nice to have a flash.  Will have to install a flashlight app (Quick Settings has it - see below for more Quick Settings functions).  Of course, that will drain the battery!!!CONS ---- Short battery life- sometimes, though, not always, slow GPS acquisition - one reviewer recommended the GPS STATUS & TOOLBOX app that can reset the GPS.  Will have to try it.- LACKS a FILE MANAGER app!!!  How can this be?  Transferred files via Bluetooth & couldn't figure out where it was placed.  I don't know if it is in internal memory or on my SD card. I'll have pull the micro SD card out & load it into my PC or connect/mount via USB.- LACKS the TASK MANAGER which is useful for seeing what apps are running & allows apps to be killed to save battery life.  File Manager & Task Manager were on my Samsung Intercept.- No attachment point to attach a short leash through which to put a finger or two.  Nice to have a very short leash to avoid dropping the phone. Looks like I might be able to thread my Samsung leash through some chassis holes under the battery cover - we'll see.- THE BIGGEST NEGATIVE!!! Cannot turn off the VM Power on & Power Off scream!!!  On my Samsung,I had installed the QUICK SETTING free app which has a \"system volume\" setting that when set to ZERO, mutes the Power OFF VM Scream, but not the Power ON Scream.All in all, I like this phone and have NOT experienced any of the problems some posters have listed : light leakage? auto-rebooting - maybe from installed apps? so I'm going slow with the installs & keeping track of when I install apps; flicker ??? I wouldn't return a phone for a power on flicker, my compact fluorescent lights flicker sometimes when I turn them on - doesn't seem to be a big deal as it does not affect the function of the phone.Will update in a few weeks.UDPATE >> 2 weeks later...Have had 2 auto reboots, but none in the past week.  One day, had a major screen problem whereby the bottom half of the screen was darkened, like when the virtual keyboard is showing, but no KEYS are shown.  This accompanied several problems, such as not being able to shut down phone w/o removing battery.  Then not starting up.  The 1/2 dark screen problem occurred when pressing the search button.  Had to pull out the battery several times to restart phone.  RESOLVED PROBLEM by RESETTING the phone back to original factory condition.  That was a week ago and the problem has NOT reoccurred.  I was ready to send the phone back to AMAZON, but then the GPS started working better.GPS - was slow to acquire or not acquiring at all.  Called MOTOROLA who was no help. They treated me like an had now idea what I was doing. Then about a 5 days ago,  around 6 UPDATES auto-installed.  These were either bundled apps or OS embedded apps, such as the voice recognition app, the bundled SCVNGR game, etc.  After that, the GPS worked much better.  As far as I could tell none of the auto-updated apps/modules were directly GPS related.  Perhaps one or two of them was interfering with the GPS???Bottom line, the now GPS works acceptably.  Usually could find my location within 2 minutes, sometimes much more quickly.  There are still some instances when I could not get a location fix, but generally, the GPS performance is acceptable, not stellar, but good enough.NOTE - I have the GPS TEST app installed which shows the # of satellite signals acquired & their strenght.  Google Maps has a LAG between when GPS TEST shows 4 or more signals.  It almost seems that running the GPS TEST app helps trigger Google Maps to recognize the GPS signals but that's difficult to ascertain.Battery - bought a 2000 mah battery from eBay for only $5 shipped.  It did not seem to last any longer than the standard 1350mah battery, but a 2nd battery is good to have.  I can generally get 12 - 16 hours on a full charge on either battery.  Obviously your results will vary.  I use the GPS often for transit directions which is a heavy battery drain.BOTTOM LINE, after 2 weeks, it works much better despite the aforementioned rebooting & screen freezing problem that have not reoccurred.

To each his / her own , I guess.We do not have insurance on the phone nor have we had any major problems so I cannot speak to that, but again so far, it is much better in terms of price of the data plan, and as an old Apple fan from way back, painful but true, just as good as an iphone (if not better) for our purposes.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "A little bit of hacking and this went from below average to outstanding", "Author": "T.

The UI was pretty standard Android, without too much pre-installed bloatware; in other words, good, but nothing to really write home about.After I rooted it and installed the MIUI interface, then another hack to fix the GPS, this phone is pretty easily the best of the no contract phones available.As far as form factor, I love the size of the screen and the rubberized coating eliminates the need for a cover. Gorilla Glass pretty much eliminates the need for a screen protector. The speakers are very good, but I have yet to use the speakerphone function much. I largely use the bluetooth mic, but after the replacement OS, sound quality when just using the handset is more than satisfactory. If I could change anything, I might round the edges a bit to make it fit more comfortably in a pocket.The only real caveat that I've noticed is that when using wifi and bluetooth at the same time, they apparently have a conflict.All in all, if you're comfortable with rooting your phone and installing a third party OS, I'd highly recommend this phone.

Brody", "ReviewID": "R3CPQE4DJA2Z43", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After losing my job, I needed to cut costs.  I have become very reliant on having a smartphone, after having 3 different BlackBerry's and an iPhone.  But I needed to chop that $125 a month down significantly.  I researched options, and saw that Virgin Mobile offered a pretty modern Android phone for $55 per month, unlimited everything.  I did my research, read reviews, and decided that I'd take the plunge.  I cancelled my AT&T; contract, sold my iPhone on eBay, and I was set up with Virgin Mobile and the Motorola Triumph.After 3 months, I can say, that this is a very serviceable phone.  It does everything I need it to, and it's very reliable, for the most part.  The phone DOES have a lot of different bugs and quirks, but I can deal with them, if it saves me $70 per month.  This is certainly no iPhone, but it does the job.  I can surf the web pretty darn quickly, the apps in the Android Markerplace are ok (not nearly as good as Apple though), and my texts and calls are pretty reliable.  The sprint network, which is what I'm connected to, isn't bad.  It's not as good as AT&T; was, but isn't as bad as T-Mobile.  It's somewhere inbetween, and like I said, it's serviceable.The phone has a lot of bugs and quirks, like I said.  The GPS is horrible.  I downloaded \"GPS Fix\" apps to try to remedy the problem, and it still stinks.  The GPS cuts out often, and sometimes can take as much as 2-5 minutes to connect.  I used my BlackBerry and iPhones as a driving GPS, but can't really do it that well with this phone, which kind of stinks.  This phone also freezes a lot.  Not for long, but it's still kind of annoying.  It also just randomly shuts off and restarts a few times a week as well.  All of sudden out of nowhere the phones says \"VIRGIN MOBILE!\" and shuts off, then says it again when it starts back up.It's pretty embarrassing having a Virgin Mobile phone, so I got a phone case, which covers the Virgin Mobile logo.  I say it's embarrassing, because I'm a person who has made a six-figure income, drive a $60,000 car, yet I can't even afford my freaking iPhone anymore because of this awful economy!  Thankfully my $60,000 car is paid off.  I've toyed with selling it, but it's de-valued so much, that I might as well keep one nice thing!The camera on this phone is pretty good.  5.0 megapixel.  The video claims to be 720p, but I beg to differ.  I have taken quite a number of videos on different settings, and the video camera is horrific.  It's no better than the video I used to take on my BlackBerry Curve, when that was a popular phone back about 4-5 years ago.  I do have a Video Camera that shoots in 1080, so I'm not too concerned with the video camera, although it would be nice if it were better.The battery life on this phone is EASILY the worst I've ever seen for any smartphone I've ever been aware of.  Be prepared to buy chargers for your car, work, and use the one that comes with the phone for home.  You'll easily need 3 chargers to maintain proper battery levels, because this phone SUCKS up the juice like nothing I've ever seen.  I've downloaded all kinds of \"battery fix\" apps, but all they do is shut turn off internet and GPS when you're not using it, so it has to constantly re-connect when you need it.  Sure, you can get better battery life, but it makes the phone perform worse.All in all, this is a very good phone for someone on a budget. $55 per month plus tax, I think it's like $59 or something per month, all inclusive.  I use the word \"serviceable\" for this phone, because it does a serviceable job at replacing the high end phones like a BlackBerry or iPhone.  It will never be an upgrade for those phones, but it pretty much does what they do. Not as well, but not that far behind.  It's a good value on a shoestring budget, if you must have a smartphone, like I must.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not worth $300 but it is better than you think", "Author": "13 Ways And Counting", "ReviewID": "R3DW5D82BQMKYH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently decided that paying $180 a month through Verizon for service on 2 HTC Thunderbolts was getting ridiculous. I looked into prepaid and decided that Virgin Mobile's service was certainly a lot cheaper and seemed to be adequatte for my needs. My only apprehension was a phone. I went from a top of the line device to tech that is - at the time of my posting - about two generations behind. So here are my thoughts on this phone as they come to me:I am overall very happy with this purchase. The phone has good call quality - not the best but better than expected. Voices are clear on my end and for the person I'm speaking to.The virtual keyboard is among the worst I've ever used. It needs to be noted that you cannot calibrate the keyboard. This is typically a standard feature on droid devices but for whatever reason it isn't here. There is no auto-correct either. This can be fixed though thanks to the Play Store (android app store). I tried various keyboards from the marketplace and found the \"A.I.type Keyboard\" to be the best option. After using this keyboard for a week now I would recommend this for use with this phone and ANY android pwoered device. You will want to have that keyboard for this phone or you will run into a lot of frustration. Get the paid version of the app.I was worried that downgrading from the HTC Thunderbolt's 8 MP camera to the Triumphs 5 MP camera would be a pain point. I have a 2 year old girl and like having the ability to grab quick, good quality pictures on the fly - other parents will understand this. The picture quality is suprisingly good though the shutter speed is a bit slower than I would like. However, I found that you just have to get a feel for the camera. What I end up doing is hitting the snapshot button (good placement on the screen too!) repeatedly. I have gotten some good pictures of my daughter playing at the park with it. I am not dissapointed at all. I cannot speak to the video though as I personally don't use it.The touchpad home, back, menu, and search keys can be a bit unresponsive at times but it is a non issue for me and causes no frustration. Lock the screen and do what you were doing again and it works every time.The touchscreen takes a bit to get used to. My thunderbolt's was VERY sensitive. The Triumph's requires a bit heavier touch to get your action to take to it. I tried a few other's Motorola phones and it seems to be a characteristic of the Motorola devices in general. I don't see this as a setback. Just takes a bit to get used to.The phone can take a moment to catch up at times. If it has been idle for a few hours and you go to send a text (for example) it will take the phone a moment to catch up with your inputs. That is where you can tell this is not the current generation of smartphones. It just isn't as fast but not really noticeable.The biggest drawback on this phone is the GPS. It rarely works and when it does the GPS signal is not reliable. I don't know if it is the hardware, firmware, or the 3G service coming from the Sprint towers. This renders the Google Maps Navigation feature on the droid os useless and that really is a dissapointment.The 3G service can be unreliable at times. It never completely drops out and my city (Omaha, NE) is completely covered by Sprint. That comes down to the old mantra of \"you get what you pay for\" and when it comes to the service Virgin Mobile is bargain bin but it really IS adequatte.So overall; I like the phone and the service is acceptable. I have found that I don't need the fastest service possible or the best phone on the market. If you are of this mindset then this phone will work. I bought mine when it dropped to $180 locally. This phone is NOT worth the $300 price. I would say it is a $200 phone.

It has many, many issues:* Ultra-short battery life and unreliable charging. USB cables that work fine with other phones don't work with this one. Five hours of use is fiction. A couple of hours *at most*  with a brand new battery. Motorola says that five hours is talk only. But why did put in 3G, WiFi or GPS if it was going to be useless on battery power?* Ultra-feeble GPS. Often it simply will not find satellites outdoors. On a clear day it takes several minutes of driving for it to find the satellites, worse in overcast or rainy weather.* Very poor built-in microphone: people are constantly asking me to repeat a little louder.* Spontaneous freezes, shut downs, reboots, and switches to silent mode. That is why I exchanged my original phones. I thought the third one was better. But it started doing this after a couple of months --too late for a store exchange or refund--, and it has grown worse over time.* A severe memory leak clogs up the built-in flash memory with junk log files until the phone becomes useless. Only solutions are factory reset, losing all data and apps you installed, or rooting the phone to nuke the offending log files. Motorola has known about the issue for at least a year; they've done nothing to fix this garbage-collection bug. Other Android phones don't have this defect; it is a product of Motorola hacking the Android platform.* 3g/WiFi (data) stop working. Apps won't update, web times out even on a five-bar WiFi connection. Only solution is to do a \"hard\" reboot (pull out battery and put back in).* Crippleware product: The phone can't be used as a wifi hotspot, even by paying extra. Motorola intentionally created a defective Android OS which has had a core Android function amputated.* No update of Android to 4.0 or 4.1, not even to Gingerbread (Android 2.3). Motorola is making  many of its current (2011-2012) phones obsolete, and to add insult to injury, it is offering a $100 rebate if you turn in your recently-bought handset and buy certain (overpriced) Android 4 phones. None of which work with Virgin, only with the dinosaur carriers (Sprint, Verizon, AT&T;).If you think I'm exaggerating, drill down into the 1- or 2-star reviews here, or check out the reviews on the Virgin site, where scathing reviews abound and even many \"positive\" reviews recognize the problems but make excuses like that it's much better than the idiot phones prepaid services had 2-3 years ago.Google --which now owns Motorola-- is making a huge mistake in not ordering its subsidiary to withdraw this phone from the market and offer credits or rebates to make amends. A year ago I would have unhesitatingly given Google a five-star rating as a company.

Still fits in my pocket, though a tad more awkward.Even though it has a faster processor than the Optimus, it *seemed* like the same speed or even slower - until I rooted it. Not sure what was going on there. Rooting it was pretty straightforward.Amazon's Kindle app had worked fine on the Optimus, but for whatever reason caused the Triumph to be totally flaky. I was seriously considering returning the Triumph until I figured out it was just the Kindle App at fault. Once I got that off of there, it has been as stable as the Optimus. (Since I just used the Kindle app to read free \"classics\", I had alternatives. I'd probably be pretty ticked though, if I actually had a library of paid Kindle books that I wanted to read on the phone.)GPS takes forever to get going. It often did on the Optimus too, but it seems even worse on the Triumph. I've learned to turn GPS on early if I think I'm going to need it.Feels flimsier than the Optimus, somehow, though in reality it has proved to be pretty durable so far.Overall, a good but not thrilling step up for the price.

I have pretty good grasp on technology and I tried every possible workaround short of flashing a custom ROM to make this phone work as it should. I own also LG Optimus V (Virgin Mobile) and will draw parallels between the two phones.Pros:=====+ 4.1\" large bright screen. After that screen size, it is tough to go back to 3.2\" screen of Optimus.+ Fast CPU/GPU combination. Angry Birds, Greed Corp, Age of Conquest run smooth like a butter. Optimus stutters on some Angry Birds levels.+ Great for browsing web.+ Great for watching videos.+ Thin case.+ HDMI out.+ OK front facing camera.+ LED flash that works.+ Can shoot mediocre 720p videos.+ 1Gb of internal RAM allows to install tons of apps. LG Optimus has only 140Mb.Cons:=====- Angular design makes it harder to remove from / put in the pocket and not very comfortable to hold to ear. My next phone will have rounded edges.- Weak cell signal strength compared to LG Optimus.- Weaker 3G signal strength compared to LG Optimus. Pandora on normal quality setting results in incomplete and looped playback.- 1380mah battery drains very fast (drains 10% per hour in standby with 3G off, GPS off, WiFi off, animations off, haptic feedback off, vibrate off). Optimus has 1500mah battery that I recharge only once every other day.- Light blue hue of the display, like color temp was set to over 6,500k.- Touch screen gets often unresponsive. It takes sometimes 3-4 presses to launch an app.- Calls using speakers result in low volume and echo on the other side.- Calls through ear piece were sometimes reported slightly distorted and low volume.- While listening music, notifications lower the volume of music and it stays low after the notification sound.- Very low call volume over Arctic Sound P311 Bluetooth Headset (Black). LG Optimus had no issues at all.- Android keyboard does not auto-correct and auto-suggest, no matter if all settings are set up properly. I recommend downloading Gingerbread Keyboard app from the market which has it working.- Very, very slow GPS satellite acquisition. It takes up to 5 minutes sometimes outdoors.Conclusion:===========The main mobile phone purpose for me is to make good quality calls. Most issues I described are reported to be fixed by custom ROMs, which I will not do. Motorola Triumph was shipped back last morning. In my opinion as it stands now, LG Optimus V is the best Android smartphone on Virgin Mobile. If you want to stick with Virgin Mobile, I recommend keeping Optimus V. Triumph is not worth the hassle.I hope Virgin will bring more 4.1-4.3\" phones. I will test drive Boost Mobile 4.3\" ZTE Warp. Boost also offers slick looking 4\" Nova Display LG Marquee .

This helped me greatly with my typing because I have somewhat large fingers.The screen is pleasant to look at. Colors and darks show up very well from what I have seen so far.This is probably the best part of the phone...fingerprints and smudges hardly show up at all. The biggest disappointment for me with touch electronics are the smudges that eventually start to show up on the screen. This screen is fantastic for reducing nasty, visually unimpressive marks.The design is cool. The square look is something I wanted coming from a rounding phone and the thickness is also just right. The phone has a certain weight to it as well that makes it feel like it is durable.Cons: I have my processor set up to reduce performance when the screen is off so that may have something to do with it, but sometimes things seem to be working a little slowly. An app will sometimes take a couple presses to register that I touched it.And a very minor thing but it may annoy some people so I'll put it here.

This doesn't bother me because I never look at a black screen, but if you prefer a black wallpaper this may annoy a little.I can't comment on batter life because I have rooted the phone and can control the processor which greatly increases battery performance. I can use it for a 3-4 days before I have to charge it again, under light use.Overall I was impressed with the phone. It doesn't compare to some of the other phones that are offered by the contract companies but for a pre-paid phone it definitely fits the bill.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not so much a \"triumph\" as a \"enough to get by\"", "Author": "J.

To start with, the 4G coverage at work and home was horrendous so I left it on 3G the whole time.  I say this because I'm sure people will get upset with me for comparing a 4G to a 3G.  This is not the case.Anyway...the phone:  It sucks.  It's the worst touch screen myself or my family has ever had.  I generally have to click on an icon two to three times before anything actually happens.  And the physical keys are just that much worst.  There are times when I want to hit the back button and would have to try with different angles of my finger in different spots on the button in the hopes that it actually goes anywhere.  Also, frequently while listening to music and I pause it when I come back and hit play it just sits there.  The pause button turns back into the play button button as if it's playing but no music no movement on the progress bar.  I found if I clear the app data and fore close, I can relaunch the app and start playing music again.  Major pain.  Next, the power button is in probably the worst possible spot.  It's directly across from the volume buttons...I occasionally accidentally press the volume buttons when I hit the power button.  I've accidentally powered up in to some weird boot screen because as it turns out, if you hold the down volume when you boot up.  Call quality is pretty crappy.  It's hard to hear and be heard sometimes.  My phone randomly drops calls if I've been on for more than about 10 minutes.  And finally, the data speed.  I don't know if it's the Virgin network (which I thought was running on Sprint) or the phone but my 3G coverage is abismal.  A speedtest.net test has me running at about 400kbps down and up.  This is the first time I've turned on 3G since my month renewed so it's not throttled.  My EVO's 3G on Sprint ran much much better than that.I'm holding onto this phone just long enough for the change to make financial sense (5 months) then I'm kicking it to the curb...HARD!", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "fail", "Author": "vinny pie", "ReviewID": "R3VXKIGJXF4ZXK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "well i got my phone quiet fast thank you seller, but activating it was a bit of a pain cuz the virgin mobile website kept saying url not found and in the end i had to call and even after that it didnt work until like the 12 time so theres that. but once i got it working it was awesome its my first true smartphone and it worked (< -key word) great for awhile there seems to be a little delay when the motion sensor when u turn it from horizontal to vertical. then my new phone took a crap i turned it off and put it on the charger came back an hour later tried to turn it on.....and it went to a screen that told me all my info and at the bottom it said battery adc = 4096, no clue what this screen was so i tried again, did a factory reset and tried to reboot several times finally i called virgin mobile and after 5 mins of telling the computer i wanted live help they told me my battery doesnt keep a charge and they will send me a new one so.....now i must wait to enjoy my phone. though i must say the customer service is actually good besides the automated part.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "flashed immediately", "Author": "aserve80", "ReviewID": "R3RXOWDKL3B96A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I switched from the intercept to this phone and love it.

I have a BB Bold for work and an iPod Touch 3rd Gen as well and the Triumph, well Triumphs both of these devices for my use. As far as touch screens go, the MT is larger and sharper than the iPod and just as responsive. I have not used it as a music player, so I can't compare that feature, but for everything else I used the iPod for, the MT equals or exceeds it. Comparing it to the BB, well screen size and resolution is not even comparable. The BB is less than half the size and I have never liked the zoom in and out on the BB. For internet use, the MT also wins, quicker page loads, better performance. This must be attributed to the phone itself since Virgin Mobile is using Sprints 3G network and my BB is on Sprint. The BB does have the physical keyboard which is pretty easy to use, but I don't spend enough time using it for it to be a major factor. I did develop a pocket dialing problem with the BB and had to enable the keypad lock which then requires a code to be entered everytime you want to use it, the finger swipe to unlock is much easier to use on the MT.The MT runs Android 2.2 Froyo and Flash Player 10.3 can be downloaded from the market. I have owned 2 Android based e-readers, so I was already familiar with the OS. There is no Motorola or Carrier crapware in between the user and the OS.Oh yeah, this thing is a phone. I use this primarily as a portable computer and texting device, but the calls I have made have been clear. The speaker phone works well and all functions are intuitive and easy to use. I recently made a trip from upstate New York to the Outer Banks of North Carolina and only once did I look at the phone and not have any signal. I have not yet paired my blue tooth headset.Battery, I have had no problems with the battery life. I can get a days use out of it with no problem. I did intall an app that lets me turn off the wifi with one press and I only have it on when I need it. I also don't require the use of the GPS, so I keep that off as well. I haven't felt the need to install or use any 'task killer' type apps. The battery life seems about on par with my BB when used in a similar manner. Heavy graphics games with birds or cars will of course use the battery much quicker, just like on any device that can run them.Overall I have been very satisfied with my Motorola Triumph and Virgin Mobile.

Let me first preface this by saying I am not a tech wizard, just a normal student who is looking for a functional smartphone.  I will not be spitting stats, processing times, or any technical jargon at you in my review.The Good:Android OS is much more flexible and less campy than the Apple's.  I have often heard that there is a serious lack of app availability with Android, but I honestly didn't notice going from one to the other.  The phone is sleek and small and the touch screen is responsive.  The ability to link up to your google account is quite nice.The Bad:Where to began...  The biggest flaw by far is the battery life.  Removing the phone on a full charge at 10 am and not looking at it all day other than to check the time and it will be dead before it hits the charger again at midnight.  That's what GPS off and very, very light use.  Standard use, a few apps per day and GPS on and it will barely make it to evening.  Absolutely unacceptable.None of the default e-mail programs allow you to switch outside of your inbox.  There is no way to insert a photo or video from the default text interface, instead you have to do it from the photo itself by manually entering in the contact or their number (what a pain).  The battery cover is really easy to remove by accident (I would recommend a phone cover to alleviate this).  The screen on/off button is on the top left, juxtaposed with the volume button creating a potential to accidentally turn the sound on without really knowing it (a nightmare for a student in a quiet class room).  The home and return buttons sometimes fail until you shut the screen on and off again.

I upgraded from the Rumor Touch so by comparison this phone is much better, but for a smart phone it has a few quirks that are not so smart.1.)  The #1 purpose for any cell phone is for talking, this phone has a poor design for talking.  Any and everyone that I talk to say that they can't understand what I'm saying because my voice is extremely muffled and distorted.  Other people just say \"please call me back when you get to a better area\".  I'm too embarrassed to say that it's not the area; it's the new phone that I bought.  I text as much as possible now to avoid the difficulty in achieving a general conversation.2.)  Speaker phone....A bigger joke than normal phone.  It's just simply bad.  The sound from the speaker is constantly being picked up by the mic which cancels out the sound from the speaker.  So the result sounds like this - \"ip...op...yip...nop...yap...bip...bup\" You get the picture!  But the speakers work great for games, music, and text-to-voice.3.)  The reception is weak.  Sitting in my house I have full reception bars on my old Rumor Touch but on the Triumph it will only reach half bars at the most.  And that's with the two phones sitting side-by-side on the table.4.)  GPS signal is erratic.  While using the navigation it is not unusual for this phone to lose the GPS signal.  This is extremely inconvenient during turn-by-turn navigation when all of a sudden it stops telling you where to turn next.The Triumph has the potential to be a great phone.  It has a nice weight, nice screen size, and it's great for gaming and texting.  Also the HD video has great quality.

So I tried using the car charger. Still nothing. Then I plugged it in to my computer via the USB cable. A message popped up that said there was a malfunction with the device I connected via USB - to unplug it, trouble shoot it and try again. I took the battery out to try to reset everything. Still nothing. I contacted Virgin Mobile's phone warranty company (which is a big scam also) as I had purchased the phone insurance. I was told this is a manufacturing defect and it is not covered. I contacted Amazon, and because it has been more than 30 days since my purchase, they cannot help. I contacted Motorola. They will only repair or replace the phone - I can't get back any of the money I paid. So I am going to send it in for repairs in hopes that - at minimum - I can get my contacts off the phone. I will then turn around and sell it to someone on Ebay who might have better luck with it than I have! I WISH SOMEONE WOULD HAVE POSTED THIS EARLIER... DO *NOT* BUY THIS PHONE!

I like the size of the screen and I have rooted mine, seems to be very easy to do. Some of the features I was surprised for the price of the phone, I like the fact it is using Gorilla Glass as well as HDMI out although I rarely use that feature. GPS is not all that great on stock, it works for me but can take 5 minutes to lock, rooted I can get it in about 30 seconds. Battery life is awful on this but I kind of expected that on this phone, if I leave mine on a full charge off the charger over night for 8 hours while I sleep, the phones completely dead. Ordered a aftermarket charger to see if that fixes anything. The signal seems to be slightly worse than my LG Optimus V but the audio seems to be alright.

It has a nice big screen that is decent for web surfing, email, games, etc.  For someone new at using a smartphone, this is a very good choice.  It is fast enough on most apps and 3G is fast enough for basic surfing and email.  However, I do have a lot of problems with reception (Virgin runs on the Sprint network.)  I have had several dropped calls and problems connecting.  The customer service also leaves a lot be be desired.  (And if you call the 888 number for support, whatever minutes you use while on hold and with the CS rep still comes from your monthly allotment.)  As for the phone itself, I have trouble getting the Bluetooth to connect to my hands-free systems in my cars.  Although I succesfully paired them, the phone will often not connect automatically and often even when I attempt to do it through my settings.  When it does connect, sometimes it will disconnect on its own.  Depending on which side of the screen I tap, sometimes it will not respond or it may take several taps.  The volume on the phone could be louder.  I usually use my phone as my alarm, but can hardly hear it event with the volume all the way up.  Last thing that I have noticed so far it that the camera is really slow.  It is a fairly decent camera, but pictures are really dark without the flash.  However, with the flash on, by the time the camera takes the picture, people in the picture are squinting from the flash.  (try taking a picture of a one year old baby!) I have not yet been able to take the picture that I wanted with my phone.  It is very annoying and disappointing.After almost a year with this phone, I get more disappointed every day.  As I mentioned before, the camera is terrible and I do not use it as often as I would otherwise.  I have just about given up on it. The phone does random restars when I least expect it.  It sometimes freezes without me realizing for a while. Also, when I first got it, I could go a couple of days of limited usage without having to recharge.  Now I have to carry the power cord everywhere with me so I can plug it in. It won't last half the day even if I turn off bluetooth and do not make any calls.  I use very few apps and only have the Yahoo email which regularly checks for updates.  I don't think this is the cause. As previously mentioned, this service is off the Sprint network which is not the best out there, but I had it a few years ago and did not have as many issues as I do now. I can not remember when was the last time I saw all the bars on my phone lit up. If I go into a store, I can not count on checking prices of items against online stores. I usually get no reception.

I think it may be downloading the whole dang newspaper...don't know, but I have no problem reading articles from most magazines or smaller newspapers like USA Today.There is no Adobe Flashplayer for android yet, so I can't watch videos from CNN and others.

Granted vm's 3g is not as fast and the Motorola triumph is not the latest and greatest smartphone. However I have to say with cm7 2.3 installed this is one hell of a phone and with the cheaper plan its saving me $540 a year, offering me close to the latest smartphone speeds and comparable service.

The phone also has many custom roms available if you would like to go that route. Call quality is also good on my phone the internet is slower than what i expected but that has nothing to do with the phone it has to do with virgin mobile, your location and the time of day (at least for me) as internet speeds are constently 3 to 4 times faster during the mornings and late at night because theres not as many people using the internet obviously. The phone also takes excellent photos with its 5 megapixal camera and takes high def 720p video the only nock on the camera is that while shooting video, it has a blur when you move it around fast.

Also, it just doesn't seem to be as easy to operate for some reason.The data and voice reception issues are far more pronounced with this phone than the Optimus as well.  I haven't taken it out of town yet really, but I don't expect good things up in Tahoe or outside the big urban areas of NorCal.Also, the GPS is pretty troublesome.  It takes 2 to 3 minutes to get a fix on Google Maps, and even then, it's usually off by a few blocks.  That makes it pretty difficult to use for driving, even if you have GM up and running when you start the car.It does have much bigger internal memory, and it can run a few apps much better than the Optimus did, however.One of these is Caustic for Android, a synth/sequencer app.  That's a pretty solid win for the MT, because its my favorite Android app.I'd say buy the MT if you can get it at a sharp discount, but not for full list price.********************1/7/13After a year of ownership, the USB port broke and I obtained a warranty replacement from VM.The replacement phone has a much better gps, although it still takes its time obtaining a lock.I recently took it on a trip to SE Asia, where it outperformed my girlfriend's iPhone 4S as an offline map tool.

Since the plan was so well priced, I thought I would go with their high end phone.  Little did I know how much problem this phone had.  The phone arrived quickly from Amazon's affiliated seller quickly and it was packaged nicely.  Charged it up and activated the phone.  The switch to Virgin Mobile from  AT&T; was simple but the phone would not fully activate.  When I called Virgin Mobile, the live assistance was helpful and I was underway in 5 minutes.The phone ran ok for about a week.  The problem started once you updated some of the stock applications and installed new applications.  The phone would just randomly reboot itself while in a standby mode or while you are actively using it.  There's no predictable pattern on when it will happen and it affects the way you use the phone.  The rebooting also happens at night while you have the phone on the night stand and the Virgin Mobile theme comes on and wakes you up.  About a week after the re-booting problem occurred, the phone would sometime lock up after you have turn it off and the only way to resolve that is by taking out the battery.  I talked to Virgin Mobile and they say all of these are known hardware/software integration problem and they have been trying to get Motorola to resolve it.  I also did some search on google and found out this is a wide spread problem on this phone.I returned the phone to Amazon after two weeks and did additional research online and found people have been very happy with the LG Optimus Slider.  Got the phone earlier this week and the phone swap with Virgin Mobile was done in about 1 minute online.  The LG have a much smaller screen but the UI is much more responsive (probably due to android 2.3).  The one thing I did not realize until I got the LG is how bad the antenna on the Triumph is.  While I got 1 or no bar on the Triumph at home, I had 3-4 bars with the LG.  So far I am very happy with the LG.If you are thinking of switching to Virgin Mobile, it's a good choice.  Stay away from the Motorola Triumph and go with the LG Optimus Slider if you can live with the smaller screen and less internal memory.

I had a slight issue switching from my old cell, but with a a call to Vrigin customer service the issue was resolved within five minutes.I upgradet from my LG Optimus V, and it is by far better with a bigger display, faster surfing, and the touch screen has a better responsiveness too.Granted I do not like the short battery life, which does last for the day and with my workload and with a phone that size it was to be expected, and it is quick to charge. I just downloaded a battery app and it helps a bit extending the life. It does come with a 2G card, but I would recommend buying at least a 16G for it depending on how much you work with it since most apps are already big.I even find apps that I was unable to find with the Optimus. My reception is the same, and even the GPS works fine altough it takes a bit to start up. I would like to see the android upgrade but since it is an older phone I don't forsee any in the nearest future, but one can hope.It does not have swype, but there are tons of apps that can be downloaded for it.I could not get the flash player working on it so if somebody has any idea how please let me know, cause I couldnt get it even downloading the app. I guess since it is still a 2.2 Android.It does restart on its own once in a while, but it has no negative effect on it. I have not had one dropped call and I did have a few with the Optimus.With the rubberized frame it sits nicely in your hand and you almost don't need a cover, but I ordered one anyhow for the good looks.I give it four stars so far for the easy handling, fast browsing, and super responsive screen.I would give five if it would have the newest android and a bit longer battery life. I will update in about one week since that is the time frame people started noticing issues to see if mine does the same.For the people who had issues putting music on I just dragged and droped my music into the main compartment and when I pushed the music button it was right there.

I ordered it and it seemed to work, but it had a strong light bleed coming from the lower left of the screen, you could see it when the screen displayed something dark, that became annoying real fast, the other issue was, the battery life was terrible, it would die within 3 hours or so with some usage but not much.Anyway Amazon sent me a replacement the next day, now this phone has a great screen display, no bleed and the battery life is way way better, still have to charge it every night, but I get 10+ hrs of my personal normal use, like today I unplugged it at 9am, and here it is 11pm and it still shows 30% battery life.. pretty good I think, considering..

Neither was I impressed with the quality of what I was hearing either. That sounded muffled too.I just can't handle the hassle of returning the phone, so I will purchase a Bluetooth set to see if the sound improves. Not exactly what I had in mind for an almost $300 phone purchase, but I am stuck in a corner.It is like, during manufacture, they installed a 30-cent microphone instead of a 45-cent microphone. You would think the incoming and outgoing sound quality of a phone would be a priority. How come they got so much else right with this phone and skimped on that critical feature!Another relatively small problem I have with it is, the battery runs out with minimal use over a 24-hour period. So, I now put it on the recharger every night.Feels solid and well-built otherwise. And the Android operating system is very nice.I am inclined not to recommend it, though. Go find someone who has one, make a phone call to a friend and decide if the sound quality is something you can tolerate. Some RadioShack stores hold them in stock, so they can probably help you test the sound quality. Otherwise, you may be disappointed.[Addition to this review, after I got phone replaced]The seller replaced this phone -- at no extra cost and no extra shipping -- and the replacement had no issues with sound.

With the rumors of a buyout from at&t; on the horizon and virgin's very attractive prepaid unlimited data plan and this phone announced for release it seemed like a no brainer to jump onto this plan. When I looked at it on paper the phone with the cheap contract was the best bang for your buck out there in the cell phone market.Well the specs may have been good, and the price may have been right, but the phone was a dud. In it's ideal condition the phone suffers from several livable, but annoying flaws. There is a screen flicker when you awaken the screen sometimes, sometimes the screen goes all while when you hit the power button, and sometimes the picture gets wavy. This is rectified by just turning the screen off and on again but for something that cost me at the time $300 new I was pretty annoyed to have such issues. Besides that the gps takes forever to lock on, and no it wasn't a faulty model they all have this problem it's an issue with the gps chip. So yes you can have 8 satellites in view, with a good signal but it might not lock onto you for ten minutes. Of course sometimes it just turns on after 2 seconds. Another minor but annoying enough issue is that the touch screen is just not very sensitive. It's a huge step up from my tiny, nonresponsive, non multitouch g1, but that thing had a little track ball to help when I needed precision that my screen refused to give me, this phone will make certain tasks like selecting text a bit of a pain. All together these issues don't ruin the phone entirely, but for something I paid a decent amount of money on these are pretty unacceptable and it really makes the device seem cheaper and less polished.Of course my biggest issue with this device is poor build quality. I didn't expect a motorola phone to be this bad given that this isn't their first android device and the company seems to have a decent enough reputation with regards to quality but early adopters of this device were punished with phones that died numerous ways. My phone personally lasted from july until november without issues, and then my phone died. No real reason for it, I just turned my phone off, and when I tried to turn it back on again it wouldn't turn on despite removing the battery and putting it back in again. Now virgin mobile was very helpful, all of their phones come with a year long warranty and I called them up and told them what was wrong and they sent me a new phone in the mail in a couple days. The day after that my second phone died of the same death as my first. I called again, virgin was just as helpful and another phone was shipped to my home. This time the phone doesn't even last a day. I turn it off, and it refuses to come back on. After the third phone I bought a used nexus s for about the same price as this phone and decided to go back to t-mobile.T-mobile has a $30 prepaid plan now(though it only has 100 minutes voip programs can make up for it on android) and the it looks like the AT&T; is not going to be able to buy out the t-mobile and corrupt their plans and service. Virgin is a good company, the signal quality while hit and miss was about as good as t-mobile, and the price is certainly appealing, the only problem is their top of the line phone is a turkey. When the phone did work at it's optimally it was as advertised a solid midranged device, but there are a lot of duds out there. If you get a solid one, that's great.

I had read some disparaging reviews online about the Triumph which made me apprehensive about moving my service over to it, but my experience has been purely positive.Even though others have said that the Triumph is pretty \"vanilla\" Android 2.2, I would have liked to see some kind of built-in task manager (holding down the Home button on the Samsung Galaxy Tab, for example, brings a list of recently-used applications and a \"task manager\" button that allows you to selectively kill apps).

These steps mainly include rooting and installing custom ROMs both of which the average user is unwilling (voids warranty) or unable to do. The main strength of this phone is a decent Android experience with no contract commitment. (It is not worth full MSRP, though. I would recommend the Galaxy S II 4G if you're looking at that price range.)I bought my phone new in July 2011. I was pleased having upgraded from an Optimus V. Out of the box, this phone runs stock Android 2.2 aka \"Froyo\". There is some bloatware that cannot be removed without rooting your phone, but the OS is stock Android otherwise. The stock experience on this feels much more responsive than the Optimus. Everything is faster. The browser, apps, and games all launch more quickly and play more smoothly.The trade off for the performance is battery life. I was getting about 15 hours on a single charge with 3G enabled. That time was drastically reduced if I played any games or turned on Wi-Fi. I keep GPS off at all times unless I need it for Google Maps. The phone takes anywhere from 10 to 45 seconds reacquiring signal from the satellites and fixing your position. This is longer than my old phone.Cell and 3G coverage will vary from location to location. If you have Sprint coverage in your area, VM service should be available as well. Call quality is the same as it was when I had Sprint. I've had a single dropped call;  However, I don't talk on the phone too often. The 3G speeds are adequate enough for me to stream Pandora while driving.I've dropped the phone several times. There is a single small scratch (1/4\") in the upper left corner that is noticeable only when light hits it at just the right angle. The rest of the phone's casing shows no evidence of damage.

Bought for its key selling features: pay-as-you-go service with Virgin Mobile, screen resolution, front facing camera, 5 MP/HD rear camera, processor, and the 3G data.Overview:This is an aggravating, buggy, flawed phone that delivers mediocre to poor quality on all of the above features except for the screen resolution, which is good, but not bright enough outdoors.Called support with Virgin Mobile, they replaced this phone 2 times. Customer service was fair/average. Bugs were made worse by subsequent replacements. Finally I just gave up.Bugs:Some of these bugs accumulate gradually after getting it out of the box. I noticed there were significant problems about two weeks after I exceeded my  return policy deadline. Yay.* Phone occasionally (1+ times a month) locks up completely to where I have to remove the battery to get it to respond.* The HD video camera usually freezes frame as it records, but keep recording the audio. This isn't just a playback issue. Even a short 5 minute video will have 2-5 \"dead\" spots where video is simply frozen.* Drop the video resolution setting to a crummy sub-HD resolution, it will cope better, only occasionally freezing video. But there are other phones with cameras sporting lower resolutions that are far, far cheaper than this phone.* Front facing camera, used for video calls, is adequate. Not great. Rear camera still shots are fair/good quality for a phone camera.* RAM memory (running apps) constantly needs to be cleared or the phone will become sluggish / unresponsive. Usually this is right when I have an urgent need like a phone call, or to look up something on an app. Very irritating.* Unless you download very few apps, the internal hard disk memory gets so full that you will have to wipe and re-install everything on this phone at least once a month. You can move every possible app to the SD memory card, and still the system files will slowly fill up and you'll be wiping the phone within 2 months.To sum up, I would never, never buy this phone. If you barely use most of its features, and hardly installed any apps, you may not have as much frustration. But there are far cheaper phones that would fit the light user better.

I previously had their LG Optimus V Android phone which I like just fine with the exception that my hands are too big for the keyboard.So, I ordered the Motorola Triumph from Amazon hoping that it would have exactly the same functionality as the Optimus and a larger screen.Indeed, the screen was larger and the keyboard worked just fine.  I was delighted.Unfortunately, after the phone was activated, the problems arose.  Most damning were the fact that I had zero bars in my office and the 3G would not connect.  With the Optimus, I had 2-3 bars and a weak, albeit usable 3G signal.To add insult to injury, the Optimus provided me with a wi-fi hotspot which I admittedly used very sparingly, but it was nice to be able to update map on the Xoom while traveling.  The wi-fi hotspot did not work with the Triumph.  This alone was not a show stopper but considered along with the weak reception became deal breaker.I readily admit that I could have received a phone that for some reason did not receive as well as it should have, but the idea of returning it and trying another was not appealing, so I simply returned it.I'm back using the Optimus (which is smaller and easier to carry) but with limited typing ability.I think the major point though is that Virgin Mobile has enough sense to sell their phones and then offer no-contract service.  If you are looking for decent service at a great price then I highly recommend you look at Virgin Mobile's Beyond Talk.  If you are in a better coverage area, the Triumph may well be a great solution for you.

Lucier", "ReviewID": "R2T9NANWOR0E8P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first Android and my fourth VM prepaid phone, I had the Rumour Touch for 8 months prior.Observations, and I'm in the coastal area of San Diego (ocean beach) for those concerned with reception:Phone is very well made, feels solid and chunky but not heavy. Nice soft rubbery case, according to Dow Corning this has their Gorilla Glass anti-scratch glass screen.  I must criticize the battery door, it seems to not be real secure and like another reviewer mine fell off after a drop- mine just 2 feet onto linoleum covered concrete. Phone didn't skip a beat and door is fine, but I think if gets bent or tweeked a bit it would be an issue. I have some domestic skills and came right home and made a well fitting vinyl case, double thick, so hopefully the next drop will be in it.Activation or swapping phones was a breeze, I sent my contacts from  the Rumour to the Triumph via bluetooth. Virgin had it activated on the second try, which is pretty good.  Phone is intuitive, I read the directions for about 1 minute and haven't needed them since.Reception....  I'm on the coast on a hilly peninsula, receiving FM radio stations other than those on the coast has always been hard, the graph on this phone is usually pegged at 1-2 bars inside, 3 outside. It does seem to affect the phone's performance at 1 bar- browsing the android market or sending messages seem a little bogged down. 2 bars, not noticeable. I can improve from 1 to 2 by simply moving around and if I go to another room 3 bars is possible. Overall I can't say it's a big deal, and the Rumour never had a bar meter so who knows if it wasn't the same. However I can see how some may have issues with it. I think it depends on your area, and the phone's reception is not defective but not top of class either.Here is a caveat to this as a complaint: As cell phones transmit their location to towers as they receive, and of course when transmitting, it is possible that reception issues inherent to this phone may have little to do with a bad antenna design and instead that the Triumph had less transmitting power back to the tower. Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you know the jury is still out on safe SAR and biological effects of RF energy. This could well be a blessing- provided you can still use it as a phone, and not a brick. I'm speculating of course but it could be the case.Battery life is not so great but I'm comparing this to the Rumour which is apples to oranges. This will run down its battery pronto (like overnight) if you leave some apps running and forget about it. As a phone and texting machine I will say I kind of miss my Rumour's physical kbd and gawdawful loud speakerphone. A few times when the background noise was sufficient the speakerphone on the Triumph was a no go, had to kill speaker to complete the conversation. I don't miss the way the Rumour seemed to hang up every call as I tried to unlock it, and its horrible touch screen.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and VM is tops in my book, I kept my $25/mo plan, that alone has my friends with iphones finally jealous with envy, as much as I was at their hardware. (though I discover the game apps are still far below theirs-the drag racing game is so dumb, why am I so addicted to it?) As for apps they are great, my non android friends are most impressed with Google Sky Map- hold your Triumph up to the night sky and sight up any star or planet, and there you go. I will give the Triumph four stars for its relatively minor flaws, let's face it, five should be perfection or it's diluted.Updating this. After a couple of months living with this I have a couple of gripes. The reception is spotty still. The touchscreen well sometimes it's buggy as hell, have to touch your selection up to ten times (really!) other times it seems to select everything in a list above and below it EXCEPT what you select, over and over, it's like fighting the phone to get it to do what you want. Speakerphone is as good as useless. And the really major annoyance is alerts only sound once and you can't program them to repeat. So if you got a text and did't hear it the first time, tough luck. These flaws do make it easy to not love. Some good: It's pretty durable, the voice recognition works really well.

Unlimited texting and internet for $25 a month was perfect for me. I decided to upgrade my LG to this touch screen Motorola. I paid $300 for it new, and I have had it for approximately 5 months. The touch screen for texting is terrible, I can't type one word without it entering a random letter ( I have small fingers, and even when texting slowly it inserts letters randomly). This phone also opens apps on its own, and runs slowly if you don't go in and manually turn them off. The lock screen often freezes, so I spend 5 minutes trying to get it to unlock, and most of the time I have to actually take the battery out to reset it. Once in a while the phone will turn itself off, or reset itself. When I try to answer an incoming call, sliding the green arrow on the touch screen actually hangs up on the person. If I make an outgoing call from the phone, the call quality is so bad the person on the other end can not hear what I am saying, and they come in unclear as well. Typically I don't receive text messages until hours after they were sent, sometimes not at all. I take really good care of my belongings, so this phone is not acting up because of abuse.

I love it, and 6 weeks in, I still love it which is something I haven't been able to say about any HTC, Samsung, or LG phone I've had in the last 10 years.Pros:- It works. Its rock solid.- Fast.

At first it worked great - I installed a 16gb micro SD card and downloaded a few apps from the Google app store. I'm not an app freak, I don't care to use my phone as something to keep me constantly occupied, I use it primarily for texting, GPS navigation and a few word games. I don't even have Angry Birds.For the first 4 months it seemed to work well, no complaints. After that I noticed the occasional self-reboot about every two weeks. Now, it self-reboots about every three days. It causes certain apps to then run which were previously off. I thought maybe certain apps triggered this but after a combination of different circumstances around which the phone would reset, I don't think it's any of the apps I installed (no third-party, btw). If I don't turn off the apps, my battery will drain. The problem is the phone has rebooted when I'm not around.Navigator now takes much longer to find a satellite and sometimes the app just gets stuck - I have to exit and restart and then it seems to work fine (it would be stuck for up to 5 minutes, after which I would reset since I'm not going to wait any longer). Occasionally I would lose the signal while driving and Navigator refused to work for what it seemed several minutes or more (at this point I would use my Tom Tom which had no issues getting satellites).While watching Nexflix (phone in landscape position) I usually accidentally hit the power button since it's opposite the volume controls.The phone seems unstable and I'm reading a lot about people being frustrated with it. Some have suggested bad or corrupt hardware/memory. I've read about scanning for this and fixes, but this is more than what a VM customer should have to do to fix what seems a known issue.I wouldn't recommend this phone to a friend. I can usually deal with not-so-great technology if it's cheap. I paid $200 for the phone at the time and am on the $25 a month plan. ICS is not available for this through VM.Also, the phone already has a very thick screen protector on it when you buy it.

I offer details below, but in brief I say this: Do not purchase this phone, and do not use Virgin Mobile.I had this phone for approximately six weeks before it completely died. Virgin Mobile (henceforth VM) replaced it almost immediately, but a few months later the phone began to restart suddenly several times a day. It would also frequently freeze. It got to the point where I was taking the battery out about three times a day and putting it back in just to have a phone that would work. I asked VM to replace it, and they did--unfortunately, they replaced it with a phone whose speaker didn't work, so I couldn't use the device as an actual PHONE. Again I emailed VM, and again it was replaced--with a phone that wouldn't even start up! It would freeze at the logo screen. I have asked for a replacement phone that works properly; VM has been uncooperative. Because I paid full price for a brand new Triumph, and kept getting phones that weren't working, I filed a complaint with the FCC. I told VM about this, and they offered me a Class A refurbished phone--apparently they had been sending me \"Class B\" phones, because anything after 30 days means you get a Class B. They assured me Class B's had been checked by technicians; I argue that this is a lie because they are all defective. Furthermore, when I authorized the shipment of the class A, they emailed me back saying they could only send Class B, as was their policy--in the very next email after they told me I could get an A. So, twice now they have lied and/or misled me. Additionally, I contacted Motorola about all of my broken phones; the best they could offer me was to \"ship my phone in and have a technician look at it, and it will be returned in 5-7 days\". Who among us can be without their cell phone for a week just to have a technician look at it? VM had already claimed to have had a technician check it--why should I go without for a week to have Motorola make the same claim?In short, I would warn people against this phone. Although I think the concept is good, there are a ridiculous number of faults. If too many programs are running, the phone will slow so far down as to render it unusable--so forget trying to have Facebook, GMail, and Scramble With Friends all running in the background. There seems to be a common problem with sudden restarts for no reason; the speaker on one of my phones was broken; my camera on another was broken.Avoid this phone, and I think all Motorola products. Motorola did not back their phone when I contacted them, and how can you trust a company that has no trust in their own products? And avoid Virgin Mobile; they think themselves infallible because they lack a brick-and-mortar store, and they take advantage of their customers.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy this phone.

First the signal was very poor in my area and texting was even worst it would take me multiple times of sending the same message before it would send and some people would recieve double and triple of that message days later. At this point the phone has had some minor falls but nothing serious, the next problem i encountered was the battery was draining very quickly and having to charge it at least 2 times a day. Once in a while the battery would not charge and i would have to play with the charger to finally get the phone to charge. I called virgin mobile and they tried to do some resetting thing on their side which did nothing. And after a couple days it happened again with the charging, but this time the phone would not show that it was charging once screen was locked. So i did the resetting process again which was shutting the phone down and taking out the battery for a minute. When i put the battery back in and turned the phone on i was shocked to see my phone has wiped itself out all the settings, contacts even ringtones was gone. I called VM once again and sat for 20 mins on the phone to only be told oh well we cant fix it. Now my phone does not lock, the home button does not work the ringer is broken ( it says silent mode selected) when i cannot turn it off. Holding down the power button use to give me 3 options now all i can do is power off. Contacts will not save even if you re enter all the persons information.

I gave the two stars not just for the phone but also the poor customer service with Motorola. The last time I use the Motorola Triumph was in January now it is June. I first got the phone in Black Friday after looking at the reviews and little research I spent $300. When I first got the phone I was excited. I never had an android phone before and was Impress by the features as compare to the iPhone/iPod touch I have. For example you can upload files in desktop mode on the Internet, the amount of free apps on the market, the keyboard.  I notice I never had more than 2 bars regarding signal for phone services. Alot of people talk about how big the phone was but I was a little disappointed since I expected a bigger phone, it was not a big issue to me. The big issue major issue was the phone not charging properly. When I first got the phone I had no charging issues. A week later I would have to position the cord a certain way for the phone to charging weeks later the phone just stop charging. I research and saw many people had the same with the charging port. I called the Motorola customer department to have the phone repair. At the time I was moving and I really could not be without a phone. I cancel the repair. I brought a can of air. It work... For a week then it when back to it old tricks. I was at my new house and decide to sent to have my phone repair with a new  address. I sent the phone. One week later I check the status and it said the phone was deliver to my house. It was not. I called the Motorola customer service regarding the issue. It turned out it was delivered to my old address even though my address on my file. I went to my old apartment to see it was not there. Although it was verified they deliverEd my phone to the wrong address they insisted not to mail me a new phone until they had a UPS person go check even though I told them I already did. I am and always friendly but a lot of staff are flat out rude and ugly. I the process of getting my phone fixed and replace took over month. When I called the customer service i get place on hold 15 min or longer on several occasions, when though I have a case number I asked to be transfer to another department, they insisted on having me tell what happen for the tenth time (no over exaggeration) then the person tries to verify if they mail my phone to the wrong address when mean them calling FedEx again me being place on hold for 20 min by the time they transfer me I am on hold again for god knows how long then by the time i get transferred to right department the person is not here to help with my situation. By the time I do talk to the \"right person\" they say will talk to someone else and called me back. 4 days pass and I get no callEd then I have to go through the process again. By the time I got my cell phone at the end of Feb it still was not charging, so I brought another charger. It still was not working. So I gave up. I went to cricket. Well I about to go to college and the city I am moving to cricket does not operate there. I still have the phone so I did some research and read on the android forum if the battery for the Motorola triumph have been dead for a long period time it will not charge. I should get another battery tomorrow and I will update if it works or not. Motorola should have test the phone out longer before releasing it and they need to train their customer service staff. I understand they work long day and encounter rude disrespectful people but not be that does not give them the right to be rude to a customer because it is the end of the day and you wanna go home.

Hahn", "ReviewID": "RGRW3T8BERJKZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have now owned Virgin Mobile's top-of-the-line Android for approximately 8 months now. While I was extremely happy with the phone initially, I have unfortunately since changed my tune.Let me just start by stating right off the bat I have had to send it back for a replacement, TWICE. The biggest problem I had the first few months of having this phone was it's annoying habit of constantly turning itself off. One day it turned itself off, and wouldn't turn back on. To make matters worse, when I called to get a replacement, they insisted on sending me a battery instead of an actual phone. I was skeptical it would work....I was right. The battery was indeed a failure and so I had to wait nearly a week for a replacement phone. In all, I was without a phone for nearly two weeks. Totally unacceptable.It's good to also keep in mind that the Triumph runs on Android version 2.2 AKA Froyo. It works fine, and I have no major complains BUT in a world where Ginger Bread and most recently Ice Cream Sandwich are commonplace, it can feel a little dated. I have asked a number of times of the Triumph will ever get a proper OS update, but have never been given a straight answer.I will say that the replacement phone cured it's bad habit of turning itself off all the time. Unfortunately, fast forward to about a week ago, and I found myself needing yet another replacement phone. This time it was the screen. It was inexplicably turning very dark to the point where you could barely see what was on the screen. Also, lines and distortions would show up. If I gave the back of the phone a couple of taps, this would correct the problem. But alas, it started to happen with much more frequency.After all this you might be wondering why I am giving it a 3 Star Rating. Well, in all honesty, it isn't ALL bad.The biggest draw to this device is that if you want a nice Android with a big screen from the No Contract/Pre-Pay market, the Triumph is one of your few options. Virgin's pricing is also appealing. $55 bucks a month gets you all-you-can-eat minutes, texting, and data. But be warned: As of last month, Virgin announced that the unlimited data (The unlimited minutes and texting still stand.) isn't so unlimited. After 4 or 5 gigs, they will start to throttle you. I also have to say that call quality is pretty solid. The ear speaker is quite loud and I rarely have problems hearing anyone. The same can be said for the mic. I have been told many times that I sound loud and clear on the other end, even when bars are low. Also, the 3G is perfectly snappy. Most web pages, even ones loaded with video and content, load within 10-30 seconds. Not bad at all in my opinion. The 4.1 inch screen is handsome, big, and bright. Perfect for web surfing and watching video. The speakers are also pretty good. Like most smartphones, they can be a bit tinny, but they get quite loud. Videos and music are actually a pleasure to listen to, as well as watch.At the end of the day, I can really only recommend this phone to someone who REALLY wants a \"proper\" smartphone from a No Contract/Pre-Pay company.

I'd get it from Amazon now, but it wasn't on here back then.For being one of the first Android phones to hit the prepaid market, it's great. But now that they announced the HTC EVO V4G phone, Im going to upgrade. HTC is, in my opinion, superior to Motorola in many ways. Motorola phones break. A lot. They always shut down, don't start up, screen will go awry, keyboard will stop working, etc., and it never ends. Mine got stuck in a continual boot cycle (Motorola's bios, not the Android/VM one) and I had to send it in. Then they said they didn't get the old one back, so my new one shut off. Long story short, hundreds of minutes were wasted on tech support. Oh well, it's all past and done now.If you get it, you have to peel off the screen protector that comes with it. It makes it so much more vivid, saturated, responsive, and brighter. I don't think it voids the warranty.BUT. I wouldn't get this phone any more.

The first one would not connect at all, to any Bluetooth device and was returned. The replacement phone connects just as it should, but then disconnects after 20 or 30 minutes. The only way I have found to reconnect is to go into the phone settings, turn off the Bluetooth, turn it back on and go through the reconnection process again. That's an annoying fault at anytime. For me  however, it is way beyond just being 'annoying'. I drive a tour coach and, because we can only use a cell phone if it is hands free, I need the Bluetooth capability to work correctly for more than a half hour at a time.

Unfortunately, the old saying of \"you get what you pay for\" reared its' ugly head.  At a glance, this looks like an awesome phone.  It has a big display, it has the Android Market, so it should support plenty of apps, and it is on Virgin Mobile's Sprint MVNO.  Service should be reasonably good, right?First, the hardware.  The phone rarely showed more than one bar of service anywhere in town.  Other phones on Virgin Mobile would show 3 or 4 bars in the same location.  Secondly, the GPS reception on this thing is nearly non-existent.  It takes five to ten minutes for a lock.  The screen on this phone is cheap, plastic-y, and scratches quite easily.  I was used to the glass screen on the iPhone.Now on to service.  I signed up for the $25 per month plan before it was axed.  It gave me 300 minutes, unlimited texts, and unlimited data.  The call quality was slightly worse than using two cans with a string between them.  It constantly cut in and out.  The unlimited texts was nice, so long as I could get a signal.But the worst was the data speeds.  Unlimited data, sounds awesome.  It sucked.  I could sooner draw a picture of a website than load it on this turd most of the time.  I like podcasts and I would periodically try to download one over 3g.  It took about 45 minutes to an hour to download about 40mb.  By then the battery was drained down to 20 percent, so I couldn't listen to the podcast I just downloaded.I know that mileage may vary with Virgin Mobile's network.  But not this phone.  It is terrible.  Don't waste your money.  I am now back on ATT, which I hate, but the phone and the service work.  They have since killed the unlimited data plan that I had and they now only offer unlimited texting, which I don't need.  I only wanted the old 200 message plan for $5.  Now I have to pay $30 for family texting.

Well I found it in the Motorola Triumph.  I've owned this phone for about 7 months and it seems like with each passing month, there was a new \"problem\" with the phone.  The first month was fine.  Second month I noticed the Wi-Fi would randomly stop while using it within my home's wireless network.  Actually it did this everywhere I went....if I went to McDonalds and used their Wi-Fi...I would only get about 10 minutes of use before the phone loses the connection and then I either have to restart the phone entirely or \"stop & restart\" the wi-fi service on the phone.  Option B rarely worked, so i usually ended up having to restart my phone to get the wi-fi back which at times was a major pain in the butt.Around the 3rd month the phone's headphone port became loose....so loose in fact that the wire would randomly fall out of the phone.  This became annoying when listening to music off the phone in my car...seems i would bump my phone and the mp3 wire would fall out.Around the 4th month a big scratch across the upper right corner appeared on the phone.  I will recognize the fact that it's my fault that the scratch happened.  As some would like to believe this phone does NOT have gorilla glass, so buying a screen guard would be a good idea.I put up with these problems until last week when the phone stopped syncing with my computer.  Everytime I plugged the phone into my computer the screen froze and the only way of getting the phone back was to take out the battery to reset the phone. I tried different USB ports on my computer, restarting the computer, restarting the phone....everything you can think of and still the phone would freeze as soon as I plugged it into my PC.  I figured enough was enough and ended up bending the phone in half like a taco.  It felt good actually....I wish I could have destroyed 3 more like it!Overall this phone has problems.  I didn't really cover the fact that it has worse reception than my previous Virgin Mobile phone, Optimus V, and because of that I never made that much phone calls from it.  I did use it for the unlimited data...which came in handy when watching Netflix movies on the road.  Only problem is I could never use the wi-fi for more than a couple of minutes (as described before) and had to watch movies on a subpar 3g data connection.  Seems on full data bars, a Netflix movie would stop every 10min to load.  Compared to today's 4g data connection (like Verizon) the data connection on this phone is very subpar.  To download Android app updates is fine, but heavier loads like streaming video can become a headache while watching.This phone (along with Virgin Mobile) seem to be behind in technology with the wireless wars going on with the bigger wireless companies, so I would only recommend going with Virgin Mobile if you're on a budget crisis.  After crushing my Triumph phone, I bought a new phone (HTC Rezound) with a new Verizon contract and have been in love ever since!  Sure I pay $50 more a month and I don't have 'unlimited' internet anymore, but the speed of Verizon's 4G LTE is amazing and all those headaches I experienced with the Motorola Triumph are not present on this phone.....yet.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone, BAD COMPANY!", "Author": "cassidy1", "ReviewID": "R118FTY758AHG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I discontinued my service with ATT and got rid of 3 Iphone's that we had on a family plan.

Don't waste your money. This phone is riddled with problems that neither Motorola nor Virgin Mobile have any intentions on correcting. I'll start with my biggest complaint which has me on my 2nd (going on my 3rd) phone. The usb port which is used to charge the phone & connect it to a cpu is flawed. Its a small tab which over time wore down with all the plugging in that a android phone (& this one in particular) requires. It came to the point where I would need to have the phone sitting in a certain position to make a connection & charge which made the phone useless while charging because it would lose the connection if moved even a little. The sad part is that straight out the box it never made a solid connection 100% of the time & gradually got worse. & it didn't help that the cord included is like 2 feet long which necessitated the use of an extension cord. The phone that Virgin Mobile sent last week immediately had issues with the hdmi. I had to wiggle the cord to get it to connect. As with the first phone I was never able to get the bluetooth to connect for more than 2 minutes of conversation & the GPS will not lock my location at all. Two basic features on smartphones that do not work. The \"snapdragon\" processor has an incredible lag & I'm wondering if the 4th phone will correct all my problems or if it will need replaced every couple of months to correct the usb problem which is sure to wear down again with the normal use that is expected of a smartphone. Fortunately Virgin Mobile warranties their phones for a year & I put a 2 year replacement plan on the thing when I got it at Radio Shack. It seems now that it will be well worth the extra money. I guess I have to suffer through until a high quality & reliable phone is released on a prepaid carrier. I thought this was the one but I couldn't have been more wrong. I have since filed a complaint with the BBB & i suggest anyone experiencing similar issues to do the same.Update 2/2/2012: After filing a complaint with the BBB I was contacted by Sprint's customer service department. The rep told me that Motorola has acknowledged the issues with the gps & bluetooth & will be sending out a software update fixing the 2 issues by the end of the 1st quarter. What they have yet to address is the biggest issue which ultimately renders the phone useless. The Usb charging port. I let the rep know about the issues I am having with the replacement they sent me (more than the one they replaced) & they are sending me a replacement phone & the rep assured me that it would be a NEW phone still in the original packaging instead of the refurbished ones that they usually replace defective phones with. Hopefully the charging issue was fixed on later phones that Motorola put out. I will upgrade my review to 3 stars once the update is released.Update 2/4/2012: I stayed at a friends house last night & since I forgot my charger at home I plugged his into mine thinking that it wouldn't connect as most cords with the same tip do not charge my phone. To my surprise it did charge. His phone is some old flip phone from years past but his charger fit the phone perfectly. Then I realized that I could use the phone while it charged. Impossible with the plug that came with the phone. After further inspection I think the issue isn't actually the tab in the phone but the cord that Motorola included. Whenever I have my phone plugged in with the charger it came with I always noticed wiggle room. It can be moved up & down but not side to side. My buddies plug fit tight. No wiggle room. Then I put 2 & 2 together & came to the conclusion that zero wiggle room means that the tab in the phone will not come loose. I'm going to try & find a different cable that leaves zero room for movement.

If you compare the dbm readings in the system status compared to other phones it should show one more bar most of the time.In conclusion it had potential but between a phone with issues pointing to an unpolished rom build and a very spotty network.

Ellis", "ReviewID": "R2QAGD3SKOF0WR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I give the Motorola Triumph a star for the one week it worked.  Then the saga begins.The phone would not turn on, no matter if plugged in or how long I charged.  Since the phone wasonly a month or so old, it was clearly under warranty.  No problem, I thought,  I'll send it in to Motorola's repairfacility.  About 10 days pass, and I receive my \"repaired\" phone back.  With the eagerness of a child on Christmas morning, I open the package.Problem is, the phone still won't turn on.  That's a problem for an electronic device.Back I send the phone to Motorola's repair center.  Another 10 days pass (their guarantee is the phonewill be \"fixed\" and returned within 5 business days after receipt.  They do hold to the delivery part.  If only....), and the phone returns.With less than child-like glee, more like lingering dread, I open this second package, with my less-than-beloved Motorola Triumph inside.Need I tell you .... the phone would not turn on.  Like a kid on Christmas without batteries for the shiny new toy, I was not happy.So, I resorted to the phone-line customer service.  After I explained my dismay at having a dead phone after two tries at repair, I was switchedto Johnny in the \"Repair Escalation\" department.  He was apologetic, sympathetic, and said \"yes, we will replace your phone.  However, we do nothave any of your model in stock.\"  When I asked if we were talking days or weeks until new phones of my model would arrive, Johnny said,  \"We just don't know.\"He called a week later to check in (nice fellow) and told me still no phones.  A couple of weeks go by and I notice on the Virgin Mobile website, that they areselling the Motorola Triumph once again (they were out at the time of my first chat with Johnny, lending some credibility to the assertion Motorola had none either).I called Motorola's customer service, was directed to the \"Repair Escalation\"  department, and explained my observation that since Virgin Mobile now had theMotorola Triumph again, it seemed logical Motorola would have a few now also.  Ah yes,  I was told, the status had just changed.  My address was verified and my replacementwould be sent out.  .... A week goes by...I call to check on the shipping status of my new phone .... only to be told \"No, that was a mistake ...We have no Motorola Triumph's availableto send you.\"  I politely expressed my frustration with this situation, calling it simply unacceptable.  Carol, of the \"Repair Escalation\" department was very, very apologetic saying shewould check with such and such department and call me by the end of the day.  That was yesterday morning.  It is now noon.  No call.  No working Motorola Triumph for over two months.To say I am disappointed in Motorola is an understatement.  I had one of their flipphones.  It still works like a champ.  I thought Motorola meant quality, and when defects occur as they always will in production, the problems are taken care of efficiently and professionally with as little disruption to the customer as possible.  My customer service experience with Motorola would be a tale to amuse IF not for the fact I paid for a working smart phone and have $299 sunk in my currently lifeless Motorola Triumph.

This time, after owning it for a while, I can honestly say I unfortunately agree with a lot of the negative reviews now. The phone just isn't nearly as good as advertised...My husband bought two of these phone, one for me, from amazon, and one for himself, from best buy. I should have known something was coming, when he said he had to go through six phones, and two stores before he was able to actually buy and use his phone.Yes, he found at least five defective phones while trying to buy one from best buy. He was given three phones that wouldn't work for the sales rep, who was apparently insistent that the phone was the greatest. So he went to another store, and after two more wouldn't work, he said he was ready to give up and just go without a phone, forever.But a different rep found one that worked, and began the set up with him. And I've had the same issues as he did with mine:My google account password was reset somehow when we first tried to sync it with the phones, forcing us to request a new password so we could access our own accounts!Then the phones would reset during set up, forcing us to start over, no less than four times each!For the first day, the buttons on the bottom, wouldn't work. At. All. None would respond to any touch, or even when my husband got mad and slapped the phone.Even to this day, you never know if the buttons are going to work, especially the Back button. We've just gotten used to hardly, if ever using it.The battery runs out fast, no matter what. I did a factory reset, and didn't sync up my account, didn't install any apps, and just let it sit, at around 60%, and within an hour, it was almost to 30%. Of course, using the phone, as it was intended, just makes the battery run out faster.Call quality seems to depend on who you're talking to, and what they're using. For example, my grandmother on a land line, can hear me, with a bit of an echo, she says. My mother on verizon, with the old droid 1, says I'm constantly dropping out in sound, and there is often static. My husband, with the same phone, through the same provider, can barely understand me, says I sound like a guy when I call, and often gets our calls dropped.I'd tell you about the camera, but I've never been able to use it. Ever since I first tried, it got stuck in between front and rear cameras. I went to take a pic, and bumped change to front when I was looking at settings, and I've been stuck with a black screen ever since. No amount of soft, or hard resets has helped. Turning off, or removing battery didn't help, factory reset didn't help. So no camera on my phone.Even with wifi, the browser is terrible. So I tried another, same thing... This phone just doesn't want anyone using the net. Even most of the apps that require a connection are constantly telling me there is no signal to be found. My kindle works fine with the wifi in our house, but the phone seems to think there is none.Then there's the overall responsiveness of the phone. One word: BAD!Too often, do I press an app, and nothing happens. Too often, I press the button to 'wake it' and nothing happens. Too often, I try to just use the phone, as a phone, and it refuses to work.I had high hopes for this phone, and even though it was free for me, I think it was too much...", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Great Price!", "Author": "ktw2626", "ReviewID": "R3L4DFXS13RD61", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone online because all of the retail stores wanted $299.99!

I am an old school typist----I am used to not looking at what I type.  The new trend in the marketplace to shy away from physical QWERTY keyboards has been a big problem for me.  For other people ---- those who do not know how to type or spell, I do understand that swype is nirvana.  For you people, this phone (assuming it doesn't break as soon as you buy it) just might be a dream come true.I purchased this phone approximately one month ago after using an I-Phone 3G for the past two years.  Although I enjoyed my iphone, I found the iphone keyboard annoying.  I never really got used to it, even though my friends who convinced me to buy the iphone told me I would. So, although what I really wanted to buy was a phone with a slide-out keyboard, I was instead convinced by all the rave reviews to give this phone a try in hopes that the swype keyboard would somehow be an improvement.  The short answer:  NOT!!!!!I absolutely hated the keyboard on this phone!  I tried different settings.  I turned swype on.  I turned swype off.  No matter what I tried, this phone was even worse at sensing my typing than even the i-phone. So if this something that matters to you, you've been warned.  I wish I had!Additionally, the screen broke within an hour of me turning the phone on for the first time.  A vertical white line of pixels running down the center of the screen appeared.  No, I didn't abuse it.  I hadn't had a chance to yet!On the plus side:  I was impressed with the camera and video (compared to my i-phone).  The voice actions for android was really cool, I must admit.  It was easier to use that than trying to swype!  And the screen is huge and beautiful (again, compared to my iphone).  Watching youtube was great!  If only it had a slide out keyboard, and the screen hadn't broken.  On to the next phone!  I know there has to be something out there with my name on it.

After hours on the phone with customer service trying to get my phone to function properly (I am not able to download anything) the representative actually suggested  I switch back to At&t; since they have no idea why my phone won't work.

I live in Tacoma and work in Renton. I get crappy reception. Whenever I want to go online, check my email, use an app it thinks forever then tells me network is unavailable and to try again. This ACTUALLY means..turn me off and reboot and I will work until the next time you want to use these and then you have to reboot me again. I leave me phone plugged in all night and use it for my alarm. Well when the phone is completely charged it shuts off. How the HECK am I going to be able to wake up on time for work because the alarm doesn't ring if it's turned off so its a good thing I made sure to have a back up alarm the first time I used it for that purpose. I thought aw fine for $35 bucks what more can I ask for. I have unlimited text and calling and data after I reboot. Then I downloaded pandora for in the car. Yay I thought. At least Pandora works. Um well...it doesn't. It will shut off in the middle of a song. What the ????? I am so frustrated with this phone I don't care if it's 5 dollars a month it is annoying the crap out of me with all the issues it has. Oh did I mention I had issues with logging into my home wifi but not anyone else's. Figured that out with google. Oh and the battery life. not even an hour it seemed and one phone call and it goes dead. I installed juice defender and that helped some but this phone sucks banana's big time. I'm returning it after only two weeks of use. I read all of the positive reviews here on amazon.com so I thought cool. But uh NOT cool. Phone needs lots of work. Look online anywhere but amazon and you will find this phone has a ton of issues. I've read about other people with the same issue's as me and they got a different phone and had the same issue. I have an AT&T; HTC Aria for a year and a half and not one single issue. I had an iPhone 3g and no issue's. Maybe I'm just spoiled. I think I am gonna get a AT&T; Go Phone instead and just pop the sim in my HTC Aria. I'm done with the expensive plans and didn't want to continue but switch to a go phone. What a pain.update 11/10/11I returned the phone weeks ago but got charged for another month. Tried to cancel it but I had to have the phone number. One gal found me on the computer with my name and address but had to transfer me and those people said they couldn't find me in the system. If you got the phone and return it due to sucky service keep the phone number and pin so you can take care of any issues after you close the account and return the phone.

It can take an act of god to get the phone activated. In order to activate the product, you must unpack and assemble the unit by installing the lithium battery then charging it.

They are fine if you never have a question or problem, but if you do, the customer service is painstaking and deplorable.  Nothing can be done in a timely manner, if it can be done at all.  I tried to import my number from a previous carrier, and in a few short minutes instead of having the number all my contacts know on the new phone, I was left with a phone having a number nobody knew, including me!  To make it worse, it would take at least a day, and quite possibly three just to return it to the number it had.  Then it would take another one to three days to try and change the number to the one I was trying to import.  This is number portability?  This is the age of digital control and service?

If you use bluetooth, you will be grossly disappointed.  This is a known issue, thousands of complaints.2. Phone often reboots and sometimes just shuts down without you knowing about it.  Known issue, thousands of complaints.3.  No program to sync it with.  Motorola didn't revise their syncing program so this phone could use it.  You must use your ingenuity and several different programs to load and maintain your data and music.  If you aren't comfortable storing all of your information online in your Google Mail account, you are out of luck.4.  Battery cover doesn't \"snap\" in place, it just slides up over the battery.  If falls off when you pull the phone out of your pocket, and the battery falls out.5.  Phone and battery get very hot when searching for a signal6.  GPS, Navigator, and compass do not work.  This is a known issue, thousands of complaints.7. Battery runs down quickly.  Motorola put a battery in this phone that is undersized compared to most other phones.  There is no replacement battery with more juice.  Thousands of complaints.8. Touch screen freezes for no reason at times and battery must be removed to reset the phone....so if you bought a cover to keep the phone protected and to keep the battery cover on it, you are always taking it off to remove the battery and reset the phone.9.  3G is much slower than the 3G was on my AT&T; phone.  Yet, Sprint is supposed to have a better 3G system.  Maybe for Virgin Mobile they make it as slow as dialup.10.  No note-pad app came with it right out of the box, you must download one.11.  No % key on the calculator, you must download a different app to have one12.  Motorola doesn't list accessories that are compatible with it on their website, you must \"buy, try and return\"13.  Motorola has not responded to the complaints about this phone by correcting the software or hardware issues.  It has been silent, and so has Virgin Mobile.The only pros:1.  It looks good2.  It has a large screen3.  It will keep your hand warm this winter when you hold it.  But I'll bet you can buy a very nice pair of gloves for a lot less to keep both hands warm.4.  You won't get fat from all the money you save or lose your voice from all the talking you can do on it.

Yes, it has a 1 GHz processor, but it is not dual core. Lacks a certain umph because of the 512mb of RAM. Now, there is one thing that is annoying about this phone. It seems to lack the ability to wirelessly tether. I absolutely HATE the stock Android 2.2 on this phone, and with no OFFICIAL new Android updates ever coming, I decided to try some ROM's. So far,  I have only liked 2 of them.Froyocream Sandwich ROM (Android 2.2 based)*Hence FroyoThis is still Android 2.2 yes, but because it is 2.2, all things still function on this phone. With any other version of Android(2.3+) the HDMI output wont work, and Android 4.0 the camera is not working as of now(hard at work fixing though). This is a 2.2 build, but if you have ever tried to put a theme on your phone via a launcher, this is almost the same, but better because it is built into the OS. It looks like 4.0(in ways), and though it isn't as good as the real thing, it has more features than the stock ROM.[...]Codename Android (Android 4.0)*Personal favorite and current ROM on my phoneThis is a full version of Android 4.0(from the Galaxy Nexus). It has the best multitasking by far and just seems to be the smoothest. As mentioned before, the camera as of NOW does NOT work. The guys that have made this ROM are hard at work fixing this though. I think this is the best ROM because it is so slick and smooth. This ROM also has one of the best battery lives of all i have tested so far.[...]Remember that this CAN damage your phone.
