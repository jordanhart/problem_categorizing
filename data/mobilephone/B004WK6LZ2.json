{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great First Android Phone", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "RY0R1G2C3PTTA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the HTC Hero for a few years now, and I have to say that it has been a fairly enjoyable experience. To start things off, it has HTC Sense, something I would say is a nice modification to the original Android. Sense as I would describe it is basically (at least for the Hero) a completely new GUI. It allows 7 main screens, extra widgets, and as HTC says, is more developed around \"you\". The phone is easily rootable through the XDA app Universal Androot, which is a big plus for me, but somehow, when you shut your device off, the Hero reverses the root. I'm not sure if this has something to do with my carrier (Alltel) or the actual device, but it can be tiresome to have to reroot your device to turn on WiFi tether. I am a fan of the HTC music app thats on it, it seems to be easier to navigate through than some of the main music apps found on more generic Android phones, but it seems comparable to the Brilliant Corners rom (for Viewsonic's Gtab) music player. Recording voice with the built in voice recorder is pointless due to quality, but I have found that .wav recorders found on the market proves that the built-in microphone can handle high quality recordings, and I have to say, I am impressed by it, and speaking of audio quality, tests show that it in fact, has higher audio quality through headphones (and it does support regular headphones) than most other phones, but to be truthful, I honestly can't tell a difference.Ok, so far I have been stating the pros, but lets get to the dreaded cons.First, if your looking for a phone that will make it from 7:00 AM, to 7:00 PM, this is not the phone for you, and if you are using it throughout the day, dont expect it to last to 5:00 PM. I have found though, with constant use, battery life can be as low as 4-5 hours. I have found online an extended phone battery [...] Which I have not tested, but seems to have good reviews. If you are looking for a phone to play all the latest games... well, ANY, games, forget about it! With the CPU clocking in at 528 Mhz, (and not being overclockable without a new ROM) you wont even be able to play angry birds, which by the way would take about 10 minutes to load.(I must mention here that it does come with a game on it, that seems to play fine, and doesn't lag, its called Teeter) The phone lags a lot, but it seems to get a bit better with advanced task killer. I do like to play mod files (those songs Future Crew put together, a few of the feature on Bejeweled) and if i try to do anything while i listen, it lags up and the music skips. If you are one of the people who like to install Busybox, or increase you VM size, I cant strain this enough. DO NOT DO EITHER OF THESE. I tried it, and when i restarted, my phones showed no cell connection, WiFi would not work, Bluetooth would not work, and the camera took black and white pictures, basically all the \"drivers\" failed. Luckily, it was fixable, I took it into Alltel, and they got it working again. The 5 Mega Pixel camera on it doesn't do much for me. If you try to take a picture when the sun is out and you are outside, you will get these strange white outlines on any objects. Video isn't much better, the highest quality video you can take, is 352 X 288, so don't expect to be uploading any Youtube videos (although it has the capability to...) Last, I have noticed an extreme amount of light bleeding as time has gone on, there are a few bright spots, and a large one in the middle. Not much of a problem, except when I'm trying to watch a video, or movie on my phone.Alright, so basic overview:PROS:* Has HTC Sense* (Temporarily) Rootable* Comes with an array of useful apps* Great sounding audioCONS:* Excruciating battery life* Unbearably slow CPU/GPU* CANNOT INSTALL BUSYBOX OR INCREASE VM HEAP SIZE (Do not even think about trying it)* Not the best quality pictures* Video has about 4 pixels and the sample rate is about 13 Hz (Ok, a bit exaggerated... then again on second thought...)* Quite a bit of light bleedingIf you have any other questions about the phone, even though you shouldn't even be thinking about buying it since it is pretty much out of date, feel free to ask!", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for its time", "Author": "Sheistah", "ReviewID": "RVXFGOG2DKHY3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone since I started my contract with Sprint slightly over a year ago. I love it, but compared to some of the newer phones out there and the operating systems they currently run on this phone seems a bit out dated.HTC did a great job with what they had to work with at the time. I would recommend this phone to anyone whos looking for a good starter driod. There was a recent Operating System release a few months ago that did improve a bit of the phones functionality going from droid version 1.7 (kind of a guess) to Droid Version 2.1... which is good but not as nice/fast as 2.2.There are some issues with lag now and then but its completely manageable. HTC makes fantastic phones with very user friendly and nicely designed apps and widgets already installed. My fav would be the time and weather app.. I bought my girlfriend a LG Droid and the only time/weather app on the market close to the one I have from HTC is a pain to setup and lags a bit more then I would like... unless of course you don't mind London's time and weather showing now and then lol.A great app that only works for select phone makers is called PDA Net. it comes from junefabrics.com and works as a free online tether allowing you to access the internet from your computer by plugging in your phone via USB cable. This has come in handy alot while working on the road or if you have unlimited Data (like what sprint offers) and you dont want to pay internet fees to your cable provider etc.I still currently have this phone and it is the main reason I will prob only buy HTC phones from here on out (Evo 3D looks fantastic).

In hindsight, not a very good deal.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Are you serious?", "Author": "William Prewett, Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1SUQIDWDWLBYN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me preface with Amazon being a really great service, love it for paper towels. toilet paper, and boxed mac n cheese.  Unfortunately, their electronic vendors are awful.  I got this phone on a saturday, 2 days before the earliest estimated delivery date (good thing), but it didn't come with a charger.  Ok, that is acceptable.  I scrounge around the house and find a USB charger, and Lo and Behold it doesn't fit.  No, its the older fatter USB chargers.  After rummaging through boxes in a garage, I find the thicker charger.  HOORAY!  Once again, I would inevitably be disappointed.  Attempting every single outlet and computer in the house with the charger, and discovering the whereabouts of old MP3 players to make sure the charger worked I discovered one of the most frustrating false advertisement tricks in the history of mankind.  The phone didn't come with a FREAKING BATTERY!  How could they not mention the absence of the 2nd one thing that makes a phone go???  There are 2 things one needs for a phone to work, the actual phone and a battery.  The phone being pretty damn self evident, but a battery one may just expect is PART OF THE PHONE!  GOOD LORD THIS ARDUOUS TASK TO GET A PHONE WORKING MAKES ME MISS SKY GRAND PAGERS.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!!", "Author": "israel", "ReviewID": "R7AS9E5MIR6N9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the phone is awesome came before the day it was suppose to and nothing is wrong with it love this fone !!!! :)", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "htc hero", "Author": "DINIp", "ReviewID": "RTPBSZSPVLC8U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "after using the phone for a while i must say besides the worn out buttons the screen is in perfect condition and the phone is very fast", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "Data Plan Phone\nNo Contract\ncamera, video camera\nThin Cell Phone, Sleek\nCalibrated Touchscreen", "Name": "HTC Touch Hero Sprint CDMA Phone with Android OS, 3.2\" Touchscreen, 5MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and microSD Slot - Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411XehPPn8L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004WK6LZ2"}}
