My first Android experience and very exciting the way it comes out in this Samsung Galaxy Fit.

It may not be the most powerful phone out there, because it has a 600 MHz processor, it feels more like 800 MHz. It charges very fast, but the battery is very bad, only 1350 mAh. The screen is also pretty grainy, but you'll get used to it. The screen resolution is 240x320. I do like the design of the phone, especially curved screen. Another problem is you have to buy a microSD card for this phone. You can't put any music on it and you can barely download apps without it. Overall, it's a great entry-level phone!UPDATE: I just realized this phone is not fully compatible with T-Mobile's 3G Network. That's why I'm always getting EDGE. But, my 3G coverage is getting better due to the refarm. T-Mobile's 3G Network requires the 1700MHz frequency for the device to be fully compatible, unfortunately, this has 900/2100. Also, the product model has L at the end of it, meaning it's the Latin model. The Latin model has Android 2.3.4, while the regular model (GT-S5670) has 2.3.6.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone for new android user and none technical person", "Author": "Clintroy", "ReviewID": "R1SF5LSRX2S4RQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this phone for my mother and before this she was not into technology but now it helped her to have social networks and and android at her disposal.great for persons breaking into the technology world.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Greta phone", "Author": "D.

She is an older teenager so the phone gets constant use but was not dropped in the \"water\" or otherwise abused.  It was sold with, \"US Warranty\" as part of the description.  But BREED, the seller, only gives it a 30 day refund warranty and a 90 day exchange warranty.  I had to contact them to get this information.  They don't say a word about the limits or conditions of the warranty until you need to use it.I, for one, will be vigilant and make sure I not only never buy from BREED, but also not from any place that doesn't give me info on the warranty.I'm also disappointed in  Samsung.  Seven months is too short even with planned obsolescence.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "good ole Samsung quality", "Author": "pjctk", "ReviewID": "R2XJUP5W6CL8NL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only one regret-No. sync with caller ID or pic missing.

Works fine in the U.S. (am using Tmobile network)and came with a charger that works here.  It does everything an android phone should, and fits in your pocket.  The touchscreen is responsive.  Sound is OK, reception pretty good over 2g, 3g, wi-fi.  Battery life leaves something to be desired.  I found that letting it charge until it definitively TELLS you to unplug the charger makes a big difference, but it's still wimpy in this regard.I use it for: Phone calls, texting, email, some web-surfing, calendar/day planner, listening to music, taking pictures, and running credit card payments using one of the devices that plug into the headphone jack.  It is working well for all of this.Overall, a very good phone for the price.The packaging was authentic, it arrived quickly, box was complete and new, with the charger and headphones, securely packed for shipping, no complaints regarding the seller.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00766BFH8"}}
