I've dropped it and soaked it, and it still works perfectly.  It has lots of nice features like a notebook function for jotting notes to yourself, a camera (although the photos aren't as crisp as with more hi-tech phones), alarm clock, calculator and stop watch.  The original battery (from Verizon) didn't last more than a year, but replacements are inexpensive, and I adore this phone overall.I don't like touch screens, and don't text enough to need a full keyboard, so this phone is perfect.  I have the Internet capability turned off, although it would be useful for looking up addresses while on the road.  While my husband and kids have gone through two fancy phones each in the time I've owned this one (one dropped in the toilet, one shattered on the floor, one just died on its own, and one started typing random letters in texts) I've had the same bullet-proof phone.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than expected", "Author": "copr165", "ReviewID": "RSGFSGNPKBJRQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sellers sent this quickly and when you order something useful don't know what to expect.

Showed a little wear, but really in great shape.  They were as advertised.  Service is Excellent!  One of the phones had a wall charger that didn't work (didn't receive electrical current).  I contacted them through Amazon.  They responded immediately - shipped out new charger same day AND said I could throw the other one away. They saved me from having to do anything!  No return shipping, etc.  That, to me is Outstanding Customer Service!  We love the phones!  Perfect for people who prefer flip phone.  Durable - which is good for my hunter and my 85 yr old mother!  Mother likes to text some, but gets real confused with a qwerty keyboard.  Texting is smooth and easy with the dial pad on this phone - works really great for her.  The feature to announce who's calling helps her because some ring tones don't register with her hearing aid.  The voice announce works perfect.

I take mine in wooded areas, industrial plant areas, and even under vehicles.  I don't ever remember submerging it, but it has been in water soaked clothing on numerous occasions.  Call quality has been good.  I am now starting to notice some more breakup in calls as the phone has aged, but at this point it is hard to complain.My biggest complaint is that it does not stay connected with blue tooth headsets as well as I would like.  It almost needs line of sight if you are just sitting idle.  I have tried a couple of different headsets with the same results.Sending text messages is a little difficult without a keyboard but that is a given.  The camera is average.
