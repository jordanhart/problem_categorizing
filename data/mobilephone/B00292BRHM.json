After 7 calls to t-mobile and hours of trouble shooting, T mobile contacted balckberry. Blackberry said that the phone was not new! It was used in England and was reprogrammed and the issues I was having with the phone will keep on happening as it was never made to be used with T-mobile. So according to blackberry Amazon sold me a used phone.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Won't buy again.", "Author": "Adrian Bose \"feeldavibe\"", "ReviewID": "R527DTRBZH3MB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone was very pretty and looked brand new, however within 10 minutes of using the phone, the famous blackberry trackball began to give problems. It would scroll all the way to the left without warning and then stick, and then you could here the 'clicking' noise goin haywire! I thought i'd let it slide and see if the problem fixed itself, but it only got worse! The trackball would fail countless times and the phone would be rendered useless until i rebooted several times or just left it to work itself out, usually a few hours later. I wouldn't recommend buying this phone as there are much better blackberry's out there.PS I sent the phone back and am yet to receive a refund.", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Used equipment- BlackBerry 8100 Unlocked Phone with GSM, 1.3 MP Camera and Email--International Version with No Warranty (White", "Author": "JOSE MARTINEZ", "ReviewID": "R2GYM7A852TZBE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This equipment was sold like new, and is reconstructed, furthermore this lined, the broken cover and presents/displays problems in the connector of data.", "Date": "December 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "bad dispositive", "Author": "Ermida L.
