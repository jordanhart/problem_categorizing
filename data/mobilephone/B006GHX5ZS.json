{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Almost Perfect Phone", "Author": "Fortune Doll", "ReviewID": "R1OFTVBYZ0W63K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my White Droid 2 phone the week it was released so it has been some time and I still love it. The phone is sturdy, very attractive, and reliable. The material is solid (not plastic), with a pearly gloss. I have multiple email accounts loaded to the phone.  The web access is great, my business apps work perfectly, and the camera takes very clear photos. I've used multiple Bluetooth devices from different manufacturers and did not have any problems what so ever. The call clarity is great with or without the Bluetooth. The speaker phone works pretty good but it could be a little louder. I actually upgraded to an iPhone a few months ago and returned it because I prefer the functionality of the Motorola Droid 2. The only thing missing to make this a perfect phone is a 2 way camera for video calls. You can use Skype but, you will have to continuously turn the camera back and forth (front to see other caller, back for you to be seen by the other person). I plan to keep this phone as long as my wireless carrier supports it.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "freeze", "Author": "lorielleng", "ReviewID": "R38BS1R9CBSO82", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone was in good condition, and had a clean esn.

I was enticed by the reviews I read, but since I have owned it (for about 2 weeks) I've been mighty disappointed.  It cannot hold a charge with normal phone functions being used for the entire day.  If I use simple apps, Facebook, e-mail a few times a day it dies by 6PM.  If I use Candy Crush or Navigation it dies by 3PM, and during candy crush or navigation it becomes overloaded and restarts the phone loosing all recent activities.I have not attempted to use Bluetooth since it's been a nightmare to keep a charge without using Bluetooth, but when school starts in a few weeks I'll be forced to connect to my car during my long commutes.  I'd imagine the battery will need to be recharged even sooner.To activate this phone I had to increase the data on my Verizon account.  My old plan had 1GB which was plenty, but this phone requires 2GB so now my phone bill is more expensive and I still only use .5GB.However, using this phone is very nice and the layout is user friendly.  It works excellent with Google apps.  The exterior is not cheap and feels very durable, the slide out keyboard retracts smoothly and the buttons are raised enough to locate the correct key without bumping the ones around it.Overall I wish I had my HTC Rhyme back, but only because the battery lasted for a few days even when I used navigation and candy crush, and the phone only required a 1GB data plan.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "Shellb", "ReviewID": "R17JDO1R59N1SL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the Droid 2 it does everything and more and I hate touch screens but this phone is a great buy.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOO!

Also it would act as though buttons were stuck, and not buttons on the keyboard, mythical buttons on the screen. It would open and close screens on its own.

When i recieved the phone I knew immediately it was a refurb because the Battery cover was a different shade of white than the rest of the phone, and the screen had some dust under neath it. After using it for a few days i found that it would not play video content, but honestly all i needed from it was GPS navigation, and it did(and still does) that just fine. So i was disappointed, but it did what i needed it for and i figured i'd just keep the phone. However, the last week or so it has developed a wonderful new problem. The touch screen does whatever it wants. I want to browse the web? Too bad, my phone wants to text \"ujnunujnunununjnunununjnun\" to my grandparents. I'm going to look into a refund, but i'm pretty sure its too late.Anyone who is considering this phone take note that the physical keyboard has no buttons, instead it has a smooth surface with little bumps for the letters. I personally do not like it and even after several months of using it, am slow and inaccurate when texting.

SELLER REFUSED TO PAY TO HAVE THE PHONE UNLOCKED OR REFUND ME SOME OF THE MONEY OR WHAT IT WOULD COST TO UNLOCK IT ALTHOUGH I SAID I WOULD FAX THEM A RECEIPT. THEY KNEW THIS PHONE WAS UNLOCKED AND WILLING SOLD IT TO ME! NOW I HAVE TO USE ONE OF THOSE ONLINE SITES THAT UNLOCKS PHONES OR GO TO A LOCAL STORE AND PAY $75.00 TO HAVE IT UNLOCKED!
