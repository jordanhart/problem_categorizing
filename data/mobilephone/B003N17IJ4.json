{"Reviews": [{"Title": "PEPPY PHONE, DOES WHAT I WANTED & MORE--READON...", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "R249F5070XJE4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my FIRST REGULAR ANDROID phone(other than ViewPad7 by Viewsonic). And before this, I had a HTC HD2 with Windows 6.5 (it was too buggy) and decided to go to an Unlocked HTC Android Phone. Since I am a huge HTC Fan (have been since HTC Excilabar-Dash). That said, this is how I gave a rating of 4.95:1) Fast - goes into programs, apps very fast. 5 stars2) WiFi - No problem QUICKLY hooking up to WiFi anywhere (at home or on the road). 5 stars3) Good basic Music Player - I love to play music and audio files and this does the job nicely.4.8 stars4) FM Radio - Easy to use and wonderful sound. 5 stars5) Easy to use menus - I learned this phone within 1 hour without referring to the manual!6) Added bonus--After I installed apps to my phone, I wanted to move them to my SD card. I downloaded the FREE APP called SUPERBOX from the Android Market (it is free and has 10 superb utilities including: Move to SD Card, UNINSTALL, File Manager, Task Killer, Battery Info, System Info, Memory Manager and more). Because of this program SUPERBOX, I was able to move my apps from phone memory to the SD Card! Android 2.2 and higher ASKS you at the time of each APP download if you want it on the SD Card or on the phone. Android 2.1 by default places the app on the phone. However, now that I have SUPERBOX, I have moved my APPS to my SD Card (after I installed them on phone). Note that Android prior to 2.1, you cannot move APPS to SD Card. (One of the reasons that I bought this phone it has 2.1).CONS (however, these can be \"fixed\")1) No File Manager! Minus 1/2 star! To fix this I went to the Android Market App and searched for FILE MANAGER, I found one I liked and installed and it is free and works great!2) Needed better Music Manager to move songs around in my playlists. Again Android Market App to the rescue, downloaded a Music Player FREE that I like and am so so happy that I can move songs around in my playlists.3) Poor TASK Manager! So back I go to the wonderful Android Market App Store! Yes, there I found a TASK Manager program FREE called SUPERBOX that has an Task/Memory Manager and a TASK KILLER and it frees memory so quickly--keeps this phone running smoothly and fast, fast fast!!!!4) MMS/INTERNET Settings: WiFi works right out of the box, however, as in ANY unlocked phone, you need to get the MMS/Internet settings from ATT or T-Mobile or whatever your carrier is. In my case, I am a ATT Customer and paid pre-paid for $25 worth of data and wanted to try this out in a non WiFi area. It did not work. So I placed the APN settings in myself and opps, they still did not work! Now I am somewhat of a techie so I knew most in the APN settings were inserted by me OK, but something was missing as I could not go on ATT Internet or MMS! Every phone accepts APN settings differently. So I called ATT and had to sweet talk them for about an hour because I am a pre-paid customer. Finally after I insisted for about one hour, the support person sent me to the post-paid department and the tech there simply SYNCED the settings to my phone and in just 5 minutes, I had data (internet) and MMS! I was so blessed in this because ATT does not like UNLOCKED non ATT phones, nor do they like to deal with Pre-Paid customers. However, I explained to them that I paid $25 for the LARGEST Monthly Data Pre-Paid Plan (ATT offers $5,$15, $25 good for 30 days)and I was very upset because I could not use my data, and when the ATT Rep heard this he was very helpful and this is why I was able to speak to the \"higher end\" Post Paid tech who within 5 minutes synced my phone with proper settings for both the MMS and Internet Data , both have worked rigtht then and have ever since! I mostly use WiFi at home and on the road, however, about 15% of the time, I need to get on the Internet in a location that does not have WiFi this is when I use my ATT Data. If you ONLY use WiFi and don't plan to use a pre-paid data plan as I do, then you will not need these settings from the carrier unless you MMS (send pictures or receive pictures).*I hope this helps you the person thinking of buying this phone or any unlocked phone as maybe my experience with this will assist you in making up your mind. As far as this phone is concerned, it is a wonderful phone for a beginner to smartphones, android phones and even wonderful for the more advanced person. This phone has gone BEYOND my expectations! And being an HTC/ANDROID phone icing on the cake! If anyone would like to comment or ask a question, I will answer. Hope that you have enjoyed my review.**Update August 16, 2011: Just checked the software OS and it showed 2.2.1 Android! At the time that I purchased this phone in May, 2011, I assumed that it had 2.1 Android OS. However, since I have been using the phone, I get on the internet often and notice that the phone automatically updates my APPS and programs (I set it up to do this). This is why I believe that the phone possibly updated to Android 2.2 Froyo since I just checked and it has Android 2.2.1! I do not think that this phone is upgradable to Android 2.3 Gingerbread. However I did a search on my computer and found that in the Android Marketplace there are apps for Gingerbread theme and other OS themes. Since I love the theme I have now, I am going to keep my 2.2 true to form and when I buy future Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) or 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) future phones, the themes will be real! There is only one CON about this phone: Screen is kind of small just a 3.2\". My next Android will have a 4.3\" at least!", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice Phone", "Author": "Claret Esther Zarraga", "ReviewID": "R1FHHZ8WGOJXO8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live in Venezuela and it works great,I can navegate and all the app avalible are amazing!

IT officially supports HSDPA 900/2100Mhz, bands that are mainly in use only in Europe, though I believe some US-based operators use that frequency as well.CONS:Up to android 2.1, no support for the lastest GINGERBREAD. No plans to offer an upgrade either.Short battery life, specially if you are an intensive data-and-calling user.Doesn't support skype. Although you can install it, the processor is too slow for the lastest release. No way making calls with it.Virtual keyboard: Doesn't feel as accurate as the iPhone, but you can get used to it.It can become hot when you're using intensive-processor tasks.You need to have a google account in order to take advantage of the phone. I don't know if I feel that familiar sending all my data to google......PROS:Removable battery: It trully helps to keep one on spareMicro-USB charger: It's becoming the standard, and I appreciate the fact that I don't have to carry yet another charger (the one from my blackberry works just fine)Response time: usually very fastSmall form-factor: I thought it would be bigger based on the images, but feels very comfy on hand.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Smart Phone...", "Author": "Nicky \"techky-nicky\"", "ReviewID": "R33GDVRKM4EBU5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone isn't the best smart phone on the market but it certainly isn't the worst either.

On the cosmetic front, it's a pretty good-looking device. On functionality, it offers what you need in a smart phone- 3G connectivity, Bluetooth, Friendstream (live status/photos/links updates from your friends on Facebook, Twitter and Flickr), massive storage capacity, excellent call quality, the syncing of emails and social networking is awesome... Overall, I think you get more than you pay for.I only have two gripes:1. The battery life.

A pleasant surprise is it has about twice the battery life of most smartphones, so mine is working long after everyone else's has died.Cons are it only runs about half as fast as the others, so will not run Skype at all, will not run many games, and does not have a front facing camera.  Of course I'm being redundant.  Without the horsepower to run video over IP, it couldn't actually use a front camera.  On the other hand, a low resolution front camera might enable the video to work, due to lower processing requirements.  It is great for Kindle book reading because of the long battery life.  Takes a long time for the file system to come up when plugging into my computer.  But has a great camera.

This is a good idea, but then if I needed to press numbers like a voicemail password, it would not allow me to do it.  I calibrated it three times, and it showed no improvement.  The most frustrating thing, was that if I gave up and decided to end the call, the phone would not disconnect the call.  I had to remove the battery to get the phone to end the call. I sent it back and decided to keep my Blackberry for now.  I was looking forward to upgrading, but will probably wait until Verizon gets the Iphone now.I have a hard time believing that I got the only two broken phones, I believe this is an ongoing problem for HTC.  I was not using a protective cover for the phone so it was not the reason there was a problem. I hope this helps some people make an informed decision.  I gave the phone 2 stars because I liked the concept.  It looked like if would be fun if it would only work.

For about the first month, it was great, but after that it all went to hell.  The phone locks up all the time, not allowing to anwser phone calls, or hang up when you want too.  The text keys actually stick, yes I said stick.  ITS A TOUCH SCREEN, THE KEYS SHOULDNT STICK!  Battery can be unpredictable.  When it goes to 10% life, sometimes it takes forever for it to fully die.  Other times, it can say 10%, and then die within a couple of minutes.  This I find frustrating because I do not charge an electronic device until the battery completely dies.  This allows the battery to last longer and does not put as much of a strain.  Also when I type in a phone number and press send, it will just clear the number away and wont call.  My final complaint with this absolutly horrible, and I mean HORRIBLE phone is that it will go into roaming at random.  I can be sitting in my car, and have full signal, then BOOM, I'm roaming.  I will never buy another HTC again for as long as I live.
