Kong \"DK\"", "ReviewID": "R17WF8BPH6LBR5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is light, made of plastic, and cheap as can be. Call quality is good and the built-in speaker and mic are clear enough to use in a moving car but probably not in situations much less favorable than that. It's easy enough to use but you probably won't want to do anything other than make calls. Texting is a pretty big pain coming off a smartphone. Battery life is about 3 days on standby, maybe 4 hours of talk time. Worked for me in Italy with a prepaid sim card.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "How to put in the SD card", "Author": "Steve Richardson", "ReviewID": "R2YKVSFCEZZE4J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here is a trick to save time and frustration installing an SD card in this phone.DO NOT SLIDE the SD card under the silver metal retaining clip as instructed, you will bend the contacts. Instead, use a slight downward pressure on the clip and SLIDE it toward the center of the phone. When loose raise the clip and seat the SD card into position. Then reverse the process by sliding the retaining clip toward the outside of the phone until it snaps in place. Put the battery back in and snap back the case and you are good to go.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R31V8D1A52M1UJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it is light and easy to set up and carry.  I didn't know how to set up the key guard so that when it is in my bag it doesn't make mistaken calls.  I used it in the US to test it out and it worked well.  I picked a SIM card that was for over 190 countries before leaving for Mexico. It was confusing at times, but once I figured it out, the phone worked like a gem.  It is good to have a simple phone like this for traveling to other countries.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great for the money", "Author": "Lucas", "ReviewID": "R396RMSOMIXBGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great functionality and use for the money spent.

Not sure what the difference is. The User Manual, besides being tiny print (you can download one online though) is useless. It doesn't explain how to use any of the main features or what they mean. For example, what are \"user profiles: Meeting, Outdoor\"? How do you activate the camera or video recorder (neither are listed under \"Multimedia\" as the manual suggests it is)? Confusing. So the review is based on setting it up. Haven't tried a SIM card yet when travelling out of the country.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looking for an inexpensive phone for international travel - try this one.", "Author": "James H.

Battery life is awesome lasted the whole week with one charge! Could never figure out how to use app sharing features but mostly because the SIM cards we purchased were in different languages than our native English. Also this has 2 sim card slots and a spot for a mini SD card.

But despite the specification that the phone battery will hold standby charge for many days, it doesn't even hold charge for half a day (9-10 hrs) even when not talking at all and in a good cell signal reception area. If you actually use the phone to make calls, it lasts even less. I had even fully charged the battery per instructions before first use. Completely useless because of this.BTW, contrary to another reviewer's finding, I found the ringer to be pretty loud.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Ato", "ReviewID": "RG8A0PT0GVLIT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent phone for the elderly who have no need for all those fancy \"stuff\" on phones they will certainly never use.

It has a good keypad. It's light. It holds a charge. It has a nice, bright screen. It has a camera. It has an MP3 player. It has Bluetooth. HOWEVER, the menu is hard to use. It took me forever to figure out how to find the ringtones. There aren't many ringtones. The camera isn't very good. I still haven't found the Bluetooth so I will have to get my salesperson at the dealership to pair it with the Bluetooth in my car. If the menu were a simple table of contents like on many simple phones, and I could change the volume myself, it would be perfect.

Schlies", "ReviewID": "R2XJWOGHBQ3JAZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for a trip to Brazil.  I bought the phone and then purchased a world SIM card from another vendor.  The phone worked great while in Brazil.  I had no problems just putting in any old GSM SIM card.  In the US the phone connected with AT&T; with no issues.  In Brazil TIM Cellular worked the best for me.  While in Brazil I did set it to manual mode for finding networks and then went through the list it displayed until I found the one that worked best.  It is a very simple talk and text phone, don't expect much more for the price, but what it does do it does very well.  It will hold two SIM cards that you can switch between via menu settings, very nice!  I was never able to figure out how to turn the volume up on the ear piece but it worked for what I needed.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it , very simple and a good price!", "Author": "oumou", "ReviewID": "R2LUKBWROV9LHU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it , very simple and a good price! send it to my family and it works great for them.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice one", "Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "R1EV5Q68VI1G0N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Its smaller than it looks but we like it , works fine and its simple , good for the $$, wish it had more sound options.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Ralphie \"Ralph\"", "ReviewID": "R3JNGIKFKAMDBP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far so good.
