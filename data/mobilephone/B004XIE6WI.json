{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice middle range smartphone. Buen Smartphone!!", "Author": "Jose Ml.", "ReviewID": "RUATT987AH8C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for a couple of months and to be honest is my first experience with smartphones, because it has taken me several days to get familiar with its operation, and I went from having a regular phone to this incredibly functional gadget and change has been a noticeable leap, its 800 mHz processor is quite fast and efficient. The touch screen is very good quality, sensible, scratch resistent (gorilla glass), decent amazing definition and brightness. It's camera takes pictures of acceptable quality, and the video runs smoothly. The size of the phone without being small makes it suitable for carrying in your pocket without a problem, or the discomfort of smartphones largest and highest range and price.Android as operattivo system is very friendly and intuitive, easy to use and I love power because all you can do with a phone and more!Works great with the 3G network from my country (Costa Rica). Simply insert the SIM and voila, a few minutes I was conected and running properly, I did not think it would be so simple to be honest!The only negative thing I could say so far is the short battery life when using multiple functions simultaneously (common problem with smartphones) as already mentioned in other grades here ... But this is easily solved with an extra charger in the office and at home, and upload daily ... jeje!At last I can recommend this phone without fear for those who like me (not being a fan for the latest in technology) nedd the benefits of a smartphone that have a good average performance, but with several extra applications that allow you to grow and evolve according to your needs as a user ... By the way I wrote this review from my phone, which I think is really amazing!Adquir\u00ed este telefono desde hace un par de meses y para ser sincero es mi primer experiencia con smartphones, debido a esto me ha tomado varios dias para familiarizarme con su funcionamiento, ya que pas\u00e9 de tener un telefono regular a este increiblemente funcional aparatito y el cambio ha sido un salto cualitativo notorio, su procesador de 800 mhz es bastante rapido y eficiente. La pantalla tactil es de muy buena calidad, sensible, resistente a rayones (gorilla glass), con decente definicion y brillos asombrosos. Su camara toma fotos de una calidad aceptable, y el video corre muy bien. El tama\u00f1o del telefono sin ser peque\u00f1o, lo hace adecuado para llevarlo en el bolsillo sin mayor problema, ni la incomodidad de smartphones mas grandes y de mayor rango y precio.Android como sistema operattivo es muy amigable e intuitivo, facil de usar y me encanta ya que potencia todo lo que puedes hacer con un telefono y mas!Funciona muy bien con la red 3G de mi pais (Costa Rica). Simplemente insertar el SIM y listo, a los pocos minutos ya estaba enlazado y funcionando adecudamente, no crei que seria tan sencillo para ser honestos!La unica cosa negativa que podria decir hasta ahora es la corta duracion de la bateria al usar varias funciones simultaneamente (problema comun con los smartphones) como ya lo han mencionado en otras calificaciones aqui... Pero esto es facilmente solucionable con un cargador extra en la oficina y otro en casa, y cargarlo diariamente... jeje!En fin puedo recomendar sin temores a este telefono para aquellos que como yo (sin ser un fanatico por lo ultimo en tecnolgia) ocupamos los beneficios de un buen smartphone de desempe\u00f1o medio, pero con varias aplicaciones extra que te permitan crecer segun tus necesidades y evolucionar como usuario... Por cierto he escrito esta critica desde mi telefono; lo cual me parece asombroso!!!", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "My new phone", "Author": "I.T.", "ReviewID": "R1OSRZ6MAY4TSN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone is good and works with different SIM Cards as advertised,but comes without the Manual and/or the Software which took me a long tome to find on the NET without paying somebody.The disturbing fact is that it is falsely advertised as having a 1 year US Warranty, however it is not supported by Samsung USA at all and I was advised to contact Samsung Philippines by e-mail (no toll-free number)and their response was below any expectation, but lucky I have managed to resolve the Bluetooth problem myself. The Manual I have found has mistakes regarding the correct settings in some areas.I wish Amazon will review the Warranty Policy for this product and advise how to proceed if the Service is neededI.T.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Order At Your Own Risk!", "Author": "Just The Facts!", "ReviewID": "R1GOQIZ3PATADQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone on Saturday March 7, 2012 and was pretty excited as this was to be my first smart phone. I know that's funny even to me. I added next day delivery and got it on Monday as projected, so everything up until this point had been satisfactory. Opening the package, I found everything to be as it should be at first glance. However, when anyone drops this kind of money, they are going to do a thorough review of the product no matter what it is. Upon closer inspection of the box, I noticed that the language on the back of the box was in spanish but that is not what really stood out. What really stood out is the fact that it said the model number whas not an S5830L as ordered but instead it was an S5830M. I had researched this phone before purchase and was not familair with an M model. I though maybe it's just the box...Lol. Not a chance. I took the phone out of the box and took the back plate off to check the Samsung manufaturer sticker for the model and sure enough it was in fact a S5830M model. I thought, what could be the difference. I tossed in the battery and started it up. The native language on the phone was Spanish...LolOk, now I was concerned. Was this a knockoff or what? So I next called Samsung and gave them the S/N off of the sticker on the inside. The customer service rep told me that it came up as \" No Information Available\". The rep then told me that that was because it was not a model that they supported in the U.S. I asked, ok so what does that mean? The rep told me that this phone was not meant for sale in the U.S. and that there would be absolutely no support for it here! No warranty, nothing. Now let me say this. I switched the language setting in the phone over to English and tested the phone out. Everything seems to work as it should. It also has the latest platform for gingerbread 2.3.6 . The ICS platform (also called the Icecream Sandwich platform is not available at this time for the Galaxy Ace). So everything seemed to check out with the exception that if anything ever happens to this phone then I am just screwed...LolNext I called Amazon and gave them the information about the phone and what I was told by the phon's manufacturer Samsung. Amazon appologized up and down and extended a 20% refund as well as offered to replace it with a full refund within 30 days should something not work. They (Amazon) also told me that they were going to investigate the seller as well as the rest of the stock that they have on hand for this phone. I want to be clear that Amazon has been very helpfull in this matter in standing behind their site and customers. Today, I called the 3rd party seller that is selling this phone. They are out of New York. I talked to the manager and he said that the SKU numbers matched up with their product and that it had to be Amazon's fault. He went on to say that he would send me the correct phone if I would call Amazon and return the discount that Amazon gave me first. Now come on people, I didn't just get off the boat. I did tell him that I would be happy to give the discount back but I would have to have what I ordered first. No Way would I give it back first and then still be stuck with a phone that had no warranty and would not have any assistance for should something go south with it. He agreed and said that he would send me an email with the tracking number within the hour. Lo and behold, that hour came and went with no email.It just shows me that I was correct in my assumtion. In short, be careful and order from this merchant at your own risk. You are deffinately rolling the dice.Amazon still **ROCKS** though!", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "One phone has the \"Sleep of Death\" issue", "Author": "Larry", "ReviewID": "R2UE1U2EIFC01B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Have two of these phones for a couple of weeks.  One phone works perfectly, no issue whatsoever.  The other one has the SOD ' Sleep of Death' issue multiple times.  SOD = phone shuts itself off.  Google solutions and tried them all but nothing works.  Downloaded the lastest OS - Gingerbread 2.3.4 thru Samsung Kies but issue remains.  This one is going back for an exchange.  Neither of the phone is rooted.Overall I really like the phone, value vs. price and I think you are not going to get a better deal.  A good beginner android phone that is almost iphone like.Pros: Screen size 3.5\" is perfect for me.  The overall phone size isn't too big either.  Plenty of free apps to download.  Gingerbread improves the battery life.Cons: Internal memory is small.  You won't be able to download a lot of apps.  And you can't install the apps to the external SD card unless you root the phone (become a superuser) but that immediately voids the warranty.  I read somewhere that you can un-root the phone if needed...  Last minor issue, the touch screen isn't as sensitive as I like it but this could be the problem with having a Zagg shield on.Update 9/9/11:  Received the replacement but it is also going back to Amazon.  This time I didn't even power up the phone, the problem is on the touchscreen, there are 6 spots (about the size of a dime) that cannot be cleaned, looks like it is actually on the other side of screen.  This is really getting old, all I want is another phone withour issue.  And dealing with the exchange process is a nightmare.  At least exchanging wireless phone is totally different than exchaning anything else Amazon sells.  Stay tune...", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung S5830L Galaxy Ace Dead battery.

It looked a good phone at the beginning, everything worked as expected. The only drawback at the time was the battery life. You have to be charging the phone every single day. Then suddenly the phone started to make a weird thing. It detected like if I were plugging in the charger cable showing the battery icon in the top right as if the phone were charging then 3 seconds later the phone said the cable was disconnected. Weird! At the first day of this weird behavior the phone did it like two times at the day. But then next day it went crazy, it had the same behavior but now the phone displayed it was plugged to the charger and then 1 second later it was not and it did it until I turn it off. I tried by removing the battery and give it the phone a rest like 15 minutes, then I put the battery back and turned it on again. It looked like the issue went away but one hour later guess what. It started again. So GOOD BYE, nice to meet you worst phone ever. I am returning it to Amazon.

The battery life is mildly good, it lasts about a day with heavy use. The camera is pretty good, a little pixally but overall ok. Also, the GPS works awesome when outside.there is one problem with this handseat. The internal memory (or ROM not RAM) is only like 200mb! That is way too small! After around five apps being installed your memory is too low and you recieve an error message as well as a messages that says you cant recieve texts. I find this a major problem espeially for a smart phone! To resolve this issue i had to root my phone and install LinkToSD which works pretty well, however even with all of my apps on my sd card the phone still stores the apps data on the device causing, again, an internal memory issue.

It does have some reduced visibility in direct sun light but it is way better than older touch screens I've used.The multi-touch works great. It is really sensible and the screen size is enough to type comfortable in landscape mode and almost comfortable in portrait mode.The only thing I haven't tried so far is the GPS and navigation functionality.The phone arrived without the 2GB microSD Card, but can't go against the phone and score it with 5 stars.

The phone worked for less than two month before, for no reason (never dropped, submerged, etc, the phone), the phone stopped turning on due to hardware issues.  When I called Samsung, they told me that unlocked phones are NOT eligible for warranty.  This policy is Samsung-specific (Apple, for instance, honors warranties regardless of sales channel).  I have had other smart phones (Blackberry, iPhone, HTC, etc) for many years and have never seen a phone malfunction so quickly.  CAVEAT EMPTOR - SAMSUNG PHONES HAVE MAJOR QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES.  BUYING AN UNLOCKED PHONE ONLINE VOIDS THE ONE-YEAR WARRANTY.In terms of the phone itself, it runs extremely slowly.  I'm not sure if it's the service provider or phone itself.  I've used the phone in France on the Sfr Network, USA on the AT&T; Network, in England on the Vodaphone Network, and in Spain on the Orange Network (all pre-paid service) in the <2 months that the phone worked.  Of these places it worked best in the UK but data speed was still significantly slower than my iPhone on AT&T; in New York.  The screen resolution is so poor, you won't be able to read anything on the 3.5\" screen without enlarging the text.  The phone itself feels plasticky/chincy.  I would consider HTC for higher end Android phones.  For lower end phones, there are better options from Motorola or others.

The manual that comes in the box is also Spanish so that didn't help. Luckily, after some guessing at the setting options I finally found the language setting and selected English.  First problem solved. Actually an easier way is to have a friend who has an English Andriod so you can follow his setting tree and find the language setting without guessing.Then I have to download the English manual.  The Samsung US site does not even recognize the S5830M model number.  I had to go to the Samsung UK site with this url to download the English mauual:[...].

That is not good as I cannot use the free GPS without Internet. I brought the phone to an experienced tech who specilizes in connecting unlocked phones and finally I'm enjoying the whole phone.I would have given it 4 stars if the phone comes set in English and duo languange manuals which is usuall for phones sold in the US.

And while the phone itself preforms okay, I say okay because the in phone storage is inadequate and even with a SD card I can't down load many apps to my phone because the internal phone storage wont allow it. Someone said the battery life is good but I think it is poor, mine doesn't stay charged for more than a couple hours if me or my kids are playing games on it. I have since learned the reason that the storage is so low and the battery life is so poor is that it comes with many useless apps that you can not remove and that stay running in the background so they drain your battery power.I'm actually surprised this phone is even allowed on the market or has not been recalled, the power cord that comes with it is extremely dangerous. It is cheaply made and because it has to be converted from the European standard it has two different prongs hooked together. They don't stay together very well and are very cheaply made. It comes with two and both broke very quickly, my five year old got a very bad shock and there sparks and smoke appeared when she tried to unplug it one day. Half of it just stayed stuck in the outlet while the other half came out leaving bare metal sticking out to shock anyone who didn't know better like my daughter. I turned of the power and got it out. Luckily you can buy power cords at most stores as it is a common one, so if you do get this phone be sure to throw away the cords that come with it and go buy new ones that are made for US outlets.But the biggest problem is this. If something happens to your phone. And I just dropped mine and called Samsung support they will not help you. This phone is made in China and the US based Samsung is not affiliated with them. So they would not even answer any simple questions. So basically I have had my phone for 3 months and need it fixed probably a simple fix and there is nothing I can do about it. They did give me a number to the support in China but it is a international call like that is any help at all. Thanks a lot Samsung!!!

However, it was not a \"plug and play\" process and I made one mistake.  The description of this product didn't make it clear which size SIM card you need. For this model, you need the larger sized SIM card (I think it's called a mini card) from your carrier, and the smaller sized card (micro card?) for additional storage (optional).  That mistake cost me $15 but not a significant tragedy.In my case, the provider also didn't seem to know how to get this phone to use the data services needed for internet connections or apps without using wi-fi. Once I read up on GSM networks and saw that it's a 2G technology, I remembered an option in settings for \"only use 2G connections.\"  Once I tried that option, I had could browse the Internet.The GPS capability and the Navigation app are very nice.

After that, I started using it and made a few phone calls. Good phone quality. It was much easier to hear on this phone than with the HTC Nexus One I previously owned that died on me a week before I purchased this. 3G appears to work well here in southern California, and it's on T-Mobile.I did notice the phone was set up for Canadian English, and was even set up with a Koodo Mobile splash screen (Canadian mobile company). That doesn't bother me so much as far as the splash screen goes. The Canadian English wasn't a problem until I installed the Amazon MP3 Player (because I purchase MP3s from Amazon, normally). Apparently Amazon MP3 will not work with the Canadian English locale. The phone doesn't come with the US English locale, but if you go into Google Play and type in \"more locales\" you will find a number of apps that will add more locales to your phone. I was able to use this and Amazon MP3 Player started working.Messaging is easier with the Swype keyboard already included with the phone.I tested out Angry Birds on the phone, then removed it. The responsiveness was pretty good. I only removed Angry Birds because I prefer to play it on my larger tablet.Space is pretty limited on the storage, so I was happy to see the seller, BlueTekUSA, included a 4 gigabyte MicroSD card, and I can move some apps to my SD Card. (I'll be able to move just about any app to it once I root the phone and use Link2SD).As I said, I mainly bought this to replace my Nexus One that had died but I also use my phone for testing websites and HTML5 mobile apps I make. I do most of my work from home or from Starbucks, and sometimes the internet goes out on the Starbucks or home connection, and I will sometimes use tethering and use my phone as a backup internet connection and continue with my work and stay connected to everyone at the office.I've not experienced any of the lag issues or 3G issues others seem to have experienced.

Most of the time it has no reception at all except for the 911 call.  It might be a good phone with other providers but not with T-Mobile. The other features of the phone were fine.  The camera was pretty decent too. The touch screen was not terribly responsive though.I have now bought another phone (this time from a store) for my son which was a lot cheaper, looks similar, and which has excellent reception.

I do not believe myself to be a very big app person, but you have to be an incredibly basic app person to find this to be adequate.  I have dropped this phone countless times.  I may even have dropped it off a roof (I'm a roofer).  No need for a screen protector.  I've never really used the case and I know I've dropped it face down in rocks before.  In 2 years of abuse I think I have one tiny scratch on the screen that I barely notice.  I want to get a Moto G now...I hope it isn't too bulky and huge!  I used this phone with Att and used the unlimited data with tethering (att didn't know).  I then used this phone on a prepaid Gophone plan and tethered their unlimited data for a basic phone for a month and a half before they saw the countless GB I used and shut off the data.  Now I use it with an actual smartphone plan on Gophone.  I took it to Nigeria and popped in the MTN sim card and it worked perfectly fine.

Where is the 2GB SD card?", "Author": "RaulKing", "ReviewID": "R1CCU73RUCF9IT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Positive side:- I ordered the phone on January 21 in the evening. And, I received it in Florida today January 24. The estimated delivery time was between Tuesday, January 28, 2014 and Wednesday, February 12. So, this was a good surprise.- The phone looks OK. I still need to test its proper functioning over a long period. But, all looks fine to me so far.Negative side:- The instructions book cover is in French. However, because I speak and read French, this was of no problem to me.- But, the instructions are in German - no French and no English. And, I don't speak nor write German. I downloaded the instructions from the Web. This German instructions booklet with a French cover is odd. I would like to make sense out of it.- I found no list of the parts included in the package. There may be some parts missing, but I wouldn't know it. An exhaustive list is only standard for any phone.- One of the plastic wraps containing small parts was visibly torn open. There may have been some tampering and some parts missing. How do I know?- I was expecting a 2 GB SD card included as described on the gsmarena dot com website. Their description concerns the US market. There is none. So, It may be missing, but I wouldn't know since there is no list of the included parts. Samsung typically includes a small SD memory. Anyhow, this does not appear to be a phone initially destined for the US region. Features may be lesser.- I didn't find a clear mention of the seller's company whereabouts in the package.- I find no mention of the warranty, and no warranty card as is to be expected with a Samsung phone.- A flyer was included in the package. It mentions: \"Leave a positive feedback within 7 days of delivery to extend your warranty to 45 days\". I don't buy into that. I realize that I was influenced in my choice of vendor by the positive reviews. This may explain that.Conclusion:It's too early to jump to a conclusion. But, I find these unprofessional practices not reassuring. I have doubts as to whether my phone is a legit unlocked new phone and not a refurbished one or a manufacturer's defective series.

This is also used as a back up phone because I still have my expensive VZ plan with locked phone still under contract and it's not GSM. On recent Costa Rica vacation this phone was perfect! Few dollars to get a Kolbi ICE SIM card near the Liberia airport and after activation I put $25 USD on it. I called the USA each day, text and local Costa Rica calls daily, Had GPS/navigation while my husband drove our rental car all over, data when I was away from free wifi, looked stuff up on Internet and sent emails while husband drove, took photos and videos and quickly uploaded to Facebook, and after ten days vacation - I didn't even use all the $25! Easy to check balance and add money if necessary. In the USA, I popped my AT&T; SIM card back in once we landed at airport. I was able to text and make calls again. My only complaint with this amazing phone is that the internal memory is too small. Have to be stingy with apps and move any I can to the SD card (supports up to 32 GB).

I have a memory card that came with the phone and for some reason the phone goes blank when i use the usb cord to upload pictures. sometimes while trying to initiate a function, the screen goes blank/black. dialing is another problem. in the middle of dialing the screen jumps to the home screen or it just sticks on one number and the others become unresponsive. Another problem is it gets super super hot. even when not in use.  My daughter told me maybe my battery is swollen so I purchased a new one.  SAME PROBLEM  Also the battery life is very low. during the course of the day with no special activities taking place on the phone by about four p.m the battery is dead.

Buen Smartphone!!", "Author": "dayana", "ReviewID": "R2VFGN8WUUWFI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for a couple of months and to be honest is my first experience with smartphones, because it has taken me several days to get familiar with its operation, and I went from having a regular phone to this incredibly functional gadget and change has been a noticeable leap, its 800 mHz processor is quite fast and efficient. The touch screen is very good quality, sensible, scratch resistent (gorilla glass), decent amazing definition and brightness. It's camera takes pictures of acceptable quality, and the video runs smoothly. The size of the phone without being small makes it suitable for carrying in your pocket without a problem, or the discomfort of smartphones largest and highest range and price.Android as operattivo system is very friendly and intuitive, easy to use and I love power because all you can do with a phone and more!Works great with the 3G network from my country (Costa Rica). Simply insert the SIM and voila, a few minutes I was conected and running properly, I did not think it would be so simple to be honest!The only negative thing I could say so far is the short battery life when using multiple functions simultaneously (common problem with smartphones) as already mentioned in other grades here ... But this is easily solved with an extra charger in the office and at home, and upload daily ... jeje!At last I can recommend this phone without fear for those who like me (not being a fan for the latest in technology) nedd the benefits of a smartphone that have a good average performance, but with several extra applications that allow you to grow and evolve according to your needs as a user ... By the way I wrote this review from my phone, which I think is really amazing!Adquir\u00ed este telefono desde hace un par de meses y para ser sincero es mi primer experiencia con smartphones, debido a esto me ha tomado varios dias para familiarizarme con su funcionamiento, ya que pas\u00e9 de tener un telefono regular a este increiblemente funcional aparatito y el cambio ha sido un salto cualitativo notorio, su procesador de 800 mhz es bastante rapido y eficiente. La pantalla tactil es de muy buena calidad, sensible, resistente a rayones (gorilla glass), con decente definicion y brillos asombrosos. Su camara toma fotos de una calidad aceptable, y el video corre muy bien. El tama\u00f1o del telefono sin ser peque\u00f1o, lo hace adecuado para llevarlo en el bolsillo sin mayor problema, ni la incomodidad de smartphones mas grandes y de mayor rango y precio.Android como sistema operattivo es muy amigable e intuitivo, facil de usar y me encanta ya que potencia todo lo que puedes hacer con un telefono y mas!Funciona muy bien con la red 3G de mi pais (Venezuela). Simplemente insertar el SIM y listo, a los pocos minutos ya estaba enlazado y funcionando adecudamente, no crei que seria tan sencillo para ser honestos!La unica cosa negativa que podria decir hasta ahora es la corta duracion de la bateria al usar varias funciones simultaneamente (problema comun con los smartphones) como ya lo han mencionado en otras calificaciones aqui... Pero esto es facilmente solucionable con un cargador extra en la oficina y otro en casa, y cargarlo diariamente... jeje!En fin puedo recomendar sin temores a este telefono para aquellos que como yo (sin ser un fanatico por lo ultimo en tecnolgia) ocupamos los beneficios de un buen smartphone de desempe\u00f1o medio, pero con varias aplicaciones extra que te permitan crecer segun tus necesidades y evolucionar como usuario...

However, the internet is not 3g, nor even fast enough to make it usable. I  can't even send or download photos successfully unless I continue to keep the screen lit and still it will take twenty minutes. I use a straighttalk sim, so maybe with other companies it could be faster. I also connected it to wifi which is only slightly faster when it decides to work. The phone is durable, I dropped it in a puddle and have thrown it in anger and it still works fine as I expected. Only the good die young. Also, while texting (even before the puddle and the tantrum) it will not read what buttons I am hitting. The screen works but the keyboard is unresponsive. This happens frequently and closing the app and locking and unlocking the phone doesn't help every time. The phone memory itself sucks, and there's only certain things you can put on the memory card. It should only be sold for fifty bucks tops, it's so buggy. The only reason I kept it is because I needed a phone and didn't want the hassle. Upsides; camera quality is nice and there is a flash.
