{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Arguably the best ONE", "Author": "WiseShopper", "ReviewID": "R1Y4H1I9D63738", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You are probably interested in buying a new phone but having a hard time choosing the right phone because of all the choices that are out there. After researching the best phones that are available or soon to be available (HTC One M8 and the Samsung S5) for weeks, I pulled the trigger on the M8 and picked one up when it was released to Verizon. The LG G3 is too far away to be considered. I can't tell you how awesome this phone is without writing 10 pages but I will try to keep it short and straight to the point. I hope this review helps you decide if this is the phone for you and why this is the best overall phone available right now. Honestly do not get the S5, because you will regret it. If you want a plastic phone that is powerful and probably the best in the Spec department, just wait for the LG G3. It is coming near the summer of this year and it will have amazing performance and the best display. It will probably outperform all phones including M8, but I will be happy with my HTC M8 because there isn't or will be any better looking phone that also has competitive specs this year.Why and who should get this phone?People who want a phone that:-Is well crafted and probably the most beautiful phone ever made (yes better design and materials than iPhone)-is one of the fastest phone currently available-Can live without having the best camera-Simply works without buggy software crashing and want a smooth android experience-Is one of the best phones available this year-Is a solid phone that is 90% metal and feels elegant to hold in your hand-Has very good battery life (not the best) but most people will be satisfied-Makes other people wish they had a sexy phone like it, even iPhone users-Has many \"cool\" features like motion launch, dual camera, step counter, IR blaster to be used as a remote for TVs and more, double tap to wake up, few other tricks that make it fun and easy to useWho should buy something else?People who want a phone that:-Is an iPhone (Apple lovers)-Is a Windows Phone (Microsoft lovers)-Is slightly faster but mostly plastic-Has an amazing camera and loves taking highest quality pictures with a phone-Has the best battery life and does not have a car charger-Is ugly with amazing performance and unnecessary specs.Skip this paragraph if you don't care to know what type of person is giving you this information:It is very difficult to choose a phone today because of all the choices that are available. But I finally found the ONE without compromising much. I want to give a little background about myself before you think I am just an average smart phone user. Like many of you I always want the hottest gadgets and especially the best phone. I honestly love iPhone's design but I hate their software and that is why I have always used Android phones. A few of my previous phones include: HTC EVO 3D, Galaxy S3, Droid DNA, Galaxy S4. I also had the Nokia Lumia for a very short period of time and I was not impressed by the phone or the Windows software. The only reason I did not get the original One (M7) is because of the lack of microSD slot.HERE I WILL LIST THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF THE PHONE WITH RATING COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES THAT ARE AVAILABLE OR WILL BE SOON:Overall Rating 9.6/10Positives:Design 10/10 : Arguably the most well designed phone available right nowPerformance 10/10 : One of the, if not the fastest phone currentlyDisplay 9/10 : Easily the top 3 displayExtra Features 9/10 : Missing few extras (fingerprint, heart rate monitor) but it has other features that makes up for it.Storage 10/10: Finally a microSD slot that supports up to 128GB and it has a 32GB model.Software 9.5/10: HTC Sense UI is the closest OEM software that is as awsome as the stock Android UI, I personally like the HTC sense more, it is smooth and not buggy like the Samsung TouchWiz. It has useful apps such as: BlinkFeed, Sense TV, and FitBit can be downloaded serperately and the sensors provide very acurate step counts.Negatives:Battery 8.5/10 : The battery life is above average but could have been a little better. Overall it's better than 92% of other phones. Not bad at all. A new update called \"Extreme Power Saving\" is soon to be released and it will help save a lot of battery when you turn it on, almost 70% increase. It basically turns off useless services and will probably increase the rating to 9/10.Camera 8/10 : Kind of disappointed because so many other phones have better cameras (iPhone 5s, Galaxy S4, LG G2, etc). There was no upgrade to the camera from the previous model. But I give it a 8 because the camera is decent and it has other interesting features that make up for the slightly low resulution. The camera is not bad by any means, its just not excellent. It is the first phone with dual camera and it can do some breathtaking and useful trick to the pictures using the depth information captured by the second camera. Overall I am happy with the camera.As you can see the phone is just too good to have extreme negatives, the negatives are just slightly below what is expected of a smartphone in my opinionBelow are more specific details of the phone, read if you pleaseDesign 10/10: \"This is the best looking phone in the world right now\" and that's a fairly accurate statement. Some might disagree but not many. The pictures does not do enough justice, it is truly gorgeous to look at and to hold. It feels like holding a metal artwork. It feels very solid and premium in my hands. I am only 5'3 and I have fairly small hands and I honestly think it is the perfect size, maybe 5% longer than I hoped for. Overall it's hard to find a well-crafted and more beautiful phone than the HTC M8, yes it is more elegant than the iPhone. Don't worry it is not all about design, it packs some serious power.Performance 10/10 : Let's just say it is the fastest phone available right now according to the benchmark tests I have done. The phone is amazingly smooth, everything just opens up instantly. I have not experienced one bit of lag or any errors. The Sense UI is closest as you can get to the stock Android UI experience with any OEM UI. The Samsung Touchwiz and LG UI is a mess compared to the Sense. The Qualcomm 801 processor is a fast and efficient processor. I can almost guarantee you that performance will not disappoint you.Display 9/10: The phone gorgeous inside out. The picture quality is extremely sharp and vibrant. It is easily top 3 in the graphic department. It is very bright and crystal clear. But there are a few phones currently out that outperform the display. My brother's LG G2 has a slightly better display. I hoped for it to be number one in this department but overall its nothing to complain about.Battery 8.5/10: With all the advances in technology I am not sure why there has been such little innovation in the battery field. It is not just cell phone batteries but all batteries in general. Some manufacture like Motorola has done decent job with providing large batteries in recent years. HTC has always disappointed me in this department and this phone is no exception. But I have to admit it is above average and I am fairly satisfied so far. I am able to go through an entire day without a problem. My day starts at 6 and ends at 7. My normal usage include: Frequent texting, 1-2 hours of talking, 3-4 hours of surfing and email, 30-45 minutes of games and the rest standby. I am able to get through the entire day but honestly most of us have chargers at work and in our cars. So overall I am not too obsessed over battery but the M8 does provide fairly decent battery life. Most of the tests reported a full day of normal to somewhat heavy use and I can confirm that. It was supposed to come with a setting called \"Extreme Power Saver\" but apparently it will be provided soon with an update. It supposed to limit the phone to only email, phone, text and few other basic things to save a lot of battery. Supposably up to 70% more battery. I can't comment on it until I receive the update.Extras 9/10: What's a flagship phone without some tricks? The M8 has some cool tricks up its sleeve.Camera Affects: I will complain about the camera quality later but let me state the positives in this section. Basically the camera has some tricks that help me deal with the moderate quality of the images. My brother has a$1200 DSLR camera that he uses to take cool pictures and I can do the same now with my $600 new phone. My favorite feature is the U-Focus which blurs the background and focuses on the object, like your face. Obviously the DSLR camera does an exceptional job but most people can't tell the difference with the first glance. The second camera on the device captures depth information and you can add cool affects to the pictures after you take it using that information. There few other ones like Sketch and Cartoon and Zoom effect but I find the U-Focus to be the most interesting one. But most people will use all of them because they work very well and are very easy to customize a picture.Motion/Sensors Stuff: My favorite trick is double tapping the screen to wake it up and turn it off. It's amazing how this simple feature can be so useful. I hated pressing the power button to turn on the display and now all I have to do is tap the screen. I can also swipe from the bottom to top in order to unlock the device and go to the last app I had open. You don't have to go to the lock screen, you can directly go to the home screen if you don't have a passcode setup. Swiping from right to left take you to the awesome BlinkFeed screen. Swiping from top to bottom brings up google now (voice command). Swipping from right to left take you to the home screen. The final motion trick is answering the phone by simply lifting the phone to your ear. Thre is also a feature where you hold the phone in landscape orientation and press the volume up to activate the camera app.FitBit App: The phone has a built in barometer and bunch of other sensors that can track your steps very accurately. Most phones have some of the sensors but only the iPhone and Nexus 5 has all the sensors like the M8. As a result the M8 and the few other phones can track your steps very accurately without buying a pedometer like the FitBit Flex or Force. The FitBit app was supposed to come preinstalled but you can easily download it from the play store for free. I am currently using it to track my steps and its about 96% accurate.Remote for TV and more: The M8 has an IR Blaster built in, you can control all your electronics with your phone. HTC has this app called \"Sense TV\", it's very interesting and useful. You basically select your cable provider and select the channels you have and the app gives you show times and what's currently playing based on your favorite stations and shows. Basically it's a smart guide on your phone and you simply click on the show and your cable box will bring up the show. The setup is easy, you simply select your cable box model, TV model, home theater model and you can control all of them using your phone. But I highly recommend getting this app called \"IR Smart Remote\", it's about $6 and it is the best remote app for your phone. You can basically throw away all your remotes and use your phone to control everything; it does a very similar job as the Harmony remotes. Do some research on it, you may like this app.Camera 8/10: Compared to all the other phones available, I am very disappointed at with the picture and video quality of the main camera. It is the same exact camera as the previous model except it has an extra camera. The picture quality is not bad but it is not excellent like many other phones. The main problem is the lack of resolution and bright light pictures. If there is too much light, for example capturing the sky in a sunny day might be hard; the picture doesn't capture blue sky properly. Overall it's a decent camera but I was expecting more. It is an average and maybe slightly below average camera.Final Verdict: If you want a beautiful, fast, elegant and a phone that simply works, then just get this phone as soon as you can. I know many people are comparing the Galaxy S5 and honestly the S5 has several advantages but the HTC One M8 is the clear winner to me. If you don't mind the plastic and somewhat of a bland look, then get the S5. If you want the most elegant phone that is available, then get the M8.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "The (New)ONE to Rule Them All!", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R3CVQ8RXK1RE8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love HTC phones and I have both last year's One(m7) and this year's(m8). I am NOT affiliated with HTC or compensated by them in any way. I just feel that competition and the underdog companies are crucial and essential for a healthy free market economy, and ultimately, us consumers. I have had the iPhones 4 through 5s, Samsung Galaxy S3/S4 and Note 2/3, and several Nokia(n95-97, n84/85 and several lesser phones) and Sony/Sony-Ericsson(Xperia) phones over the years, and I have loved most of them. For a healthy and positive technological evolution, we NEED the small or struggling companies like HTC to succeed. If Apple and Samsung become duopolies, that will be a dark future indeed. Pick up an HTC One(M7 or M8) and any Samsung Galaxy phones and compare the quality and craftsmanship, and tell me why it's Samsung and not HTC that have more successful phones. It's all about the MONEY and marketing, the bigger guy trying to squeeze out the smaller guy, and that's NOT how a healthy free market economy should be.Now that that is out of the way, let us get down to the nitty gritty. This is my direct comparisons to the iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 and Note 3, but mainly to the last HTC One(M7)(and yes, I am mainly updating keypoints from the m7 review):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5s is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the 2013 HTC One's(M7) screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 5.0\" 1080p(440ppi) form. The main difference between the M8 and the M7 is the color reproduction on the M8 is better and more true-to-life. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Once again, the new One continues the HTC tradition of making really high-quality phones with high-class material and craftsmanship. This version has more of a matted-brushed aluminum finish than the glossier M7. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other issue). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5/5s. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication, unlike the plastic-y feel of the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5. The One is one real looker!3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution. Compared to the M7, the M8 loses the Beats audio engineering, but it actually sounds louder than the M7, which although has really high-quality speakers as well, was known for being too soft in certain scenarios. The new moniker is just BoomSound.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick! What's really cool about the new camera is the duo camera functionality - each photo you snap is recorded from both cameras, so afterwards, you can re-focus the image, ala Lytro camera style. This is really cool and quite revolutionary for a phone camera. So in the real world, this means no more out-of-focus photos! You can now always re-focus your photos after the fact, so you will not have to regret missing out on a great memory because your photo was out of focus - awesome!5) For a phone with a 5\" screen, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 3. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance. However, it is very TALL, even taller than the M7, so trying to reach the power button with one hand while your holding it in a normal position is almost impossible. HOWEVER...6) The One borrows the features of the LG G2 where you can double tap on the screen while it's off, to turn it on! While the screen is off, you can swipe left to turn it on to see Blinkfeed, which is HTC's version of Flipboard/news reader, and swipe right to turn it on to the home screen. The one thing HTC forgot though, is you can't double-tap the screen while it's on, to turn it off, which the LG G2 CAN do.7) The user interface(UI) and software design is now even more polished,minimal, and simplistic. Sense 6.0 is the on-going improvement from the previous versions. It's really quick and light, not bloated like Samsung's TouchWiz UI. It improves on the older, but still good, Sense 5.0 and 5.5. You can move from one screen to the next lightning quick, almost as good as the iPhone UI.8) And FINALLY, HTC has included a microSD slot so you can add your own memory card for more storage(the HTC DNA/Butterfly and M7 didn't have any). You can add up to 128gb more!The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2600mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. At least it is a lot better than the M7's 2300mAh battery, which drains super quick, yet charges SUPER SLOW.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4/S5, the One is not as good. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news. The coolest feature so far for the One has been the tap/swipe to turn the screen on.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4/S5, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4/S5's fancy functions. The S5's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light, and with a more true color reproduction. The S5 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S5 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S5 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the new HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones(at least for now!).", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "best phone ever used", "Author": "Seymorebear", "ReviewID": "R1Z6IADZAWVHU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used a Moto X, Droid Razr, S4, Note 3, etc..... am on sprint now and this phone is the quickest, snappiest, and best built solid phone i have ever had.

Plenty of fun features to take advantage of. Beautiful external design. The camera comes packed with gimmicky extras. Some you may use and some you may never use. But they are there to stay, I guess. The speakers sound great. Literally, blew me away. I like that they are front facing speakers. That\u2019s a big plus! There are tons of great things about this device. No need to go into them. There are plenty of full reviews that point them out.Cons---Biggest problem on sprint: network issue- CDMA/LTE network setting. Drops calls unless network is set to CDMA only. This is a major set back since at the moment, it forces you to manually switch from LTE to CDMA if you are not on WIFI before making a call (when taking advantage of LTE/Spark).-I made a mistake of not ordering a case sooner: Don\u2019t get me wrong, the casing of the phone is metal. This does not at all mean stainless steal. Yes it is strong. But do your self a favor and get a case ASAP because this sucker is slippery. Not kidding. I dropped it on concrete and my M8 has a nice little dent and scar to prove it. Get that case!-Gorilla glass...really?: Now correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but isn\u2019t this supposed to be tough glass? Mine has scratched a bit. My old EVO 4G LTE was tougher to scratch. Maybe it was the concrete, maybe it was something else. But, I am not impressed. So I guess that means get a screen protector too.-And as expected: I have experienced odd and random system lagging and screen freezing. I say expected because this is a very new device.Coming from a Evo 4G LTE, I am very happy with the M8. The M8 is equipped with a fresher and more modern lay out. The battery life is solid (cant wait for the extreme battery saving mode update!). The speakers are awesome. It charges very quickly. The HD screen looks great. With later updates, I only see this device getting better.Over all, I have high hopes that the updates will fix some, if not all, of the problems I have come across.

It's thin, light, amazing screen, great speakers, decent pictures.  It's basically everything I expected and more.You know what's not great?  Sprint!  Sprint should not be selling any Spark enabled phones as they are all completely unusable.  If you don't believe me, just do a google search of \"Sprint Spark Connection Issues\" to see the pages and pages of unhappy customers.  As I type this a co-workers Sprint iphone5 has strong LTE connection.  My phone?  Can't load a web page and not even 3G data.  This is not the phones fault.  This is Sprint rolling out a phone before their network is able to handle it.  So us early adopters are basically paying for the privilege of owning a really expensive WiFi device.BUYER BEWARE!

After being frustrated with the S3 I saw a commercial about the new HTC One M8 and figured I'd give it a go.The Pros:Man I can't tell you just the instant gratification upon feeling this device, it really does have a solid build quality to it, rather than holding an object that feels more like a toy (Glares at the S3). The system/OS is smooth as butter, if I could I would slap that on some toast and eat it I would, it's that damn good. The display is nice and bright, colors are more natural and feels more on point rather than the over saturated Samsung AMOLED displays. The sounds are bombastic, night and day compared to S3 due to Boomsound front facing speakers. The on screen capacitive buttons aren't a big deal for me, I actually like them.Cons-My only gripe is the camera quality, its not terrible, it's not great it's somewhere right in the middle and if you take a lot of night/low light shots it excels here-Not a major gripe here but it's noticeable, phone is a bit slippery and a bit heavier but the trade offs is totally okay in my book but for some users it may be an issue.I can't see myself going back to Samsung products after giving this a go, if you are on the fence you needn't fear, take the plunge cause I certainly don't regret it.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "HTC does it right! again!", "Author": "John A Maddalo", "ReviewID": "R1KVCAS1DR3Q3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast, fast, fast!

I have been using this phone for past one day with a friend helping him migrate from a different OS. I have personally used Samsung Galaxy and other Android phones. I resisted HTC one previously due to lack of expandable memory, but glad they have fixed it. The design is beautiful and I root for all Android phones to succeed so that in the end we users win and get superior products. The phone/data connections was excellent! I will put down the key specs of popular phones as of now 2014. I may have missed some, but these are ones I have used. Note S5 is not yet out, but I am pointing the specs as the war will happen between S5 and One M8 in 2014.TOP Phones as of 2014 beginning:In my opinion, following are key specs to consider.

Aluminum body frame is great. It is indeed strange that front camera has more pixels than back camera. This may be a sign that selfies are becoming popular. There are two cameras in the back one is taking the depth information and you can do post processing changing focus in  camera. Features are : Back-illuminated sensor (BSI), Autofocus, Manual focus, Digital image stabilization, Face detection, Smile detection, Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Burst mode, Geo tagging, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Macro mode. Battery life was excellent. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend.

I reconfigure network settings via the sprint app on the phone that sets it up for the sprint network.  Sometimes this fails, sometimes it succeeds, never results in a network connection.  So, as long as I can maintain a connection to sprint's 3g, 4g (LTE), I'm fine.  If I lose it, it takes a hard boot to recover, and that only works until the next time I lose the connection, which is anywhere from 15 min to 6 hours.Amazon is sending me another.

Purchased the Sprint version from Amazon and activated in mid April.  I'm fairly familiar with customizing an Android phone. It took me 3 days to get it the way I wanted. Two things did not worked properly from the beginning:1. the message (email, text, calendar) notification front led did not function (known issue, documented all over the web). The led works when the phone is charged but it does not flash when an incoming message was present. I've contacted HTC support and open a ticket. The technical support was immediately available and professional. They supposed to call me back with the solution/answer. As of today I did not received a call back from HTC support.2. the Bluetooth connection to my car was inconsistent. I drive a 2012 Mazda CX 9 and my previous phone (Galaxy S3) worked flawlessly. I performed the pairing several time with the HTC M8 with the same result. Streaming music and phone calls worked after the pairing was completed. However, after a day or two the communication became  \"broken up\" to the point that it was unusable. Some time I've just turned off and on the Bluetooth on the phone and all worked for a period of time. Ultimately I  had to delete the device on my car Bluetooth menu  and pair it again.I was ready to call HTC when, after 18 days of usage, on a Friday evening (of course!), the phone semi-died. The screen went blank (black) and all my attempts to restart failed. Some of the phone functionality was still available - I could hear the email notifications, but no way to access them.At this point I've called HTC support again. The tech support was available immediately and very professionally they explained to me that the phone has a hardware issue  - more than likely there is a loose connector between the main board and the screen. Unfortunately the only solution to fix the problem was a replacement. HTC has different replacement options - all of them would cause me have no access to my phone number for a minimum 3 business days. They also advised to go to a Sprint store and get a replacement.I took the advice... and that it is another Sprint \"horror\" story  not for this posting.I've returned the HTC M8 back to Amazon, re-activate my old Galaxy S3, and cancel my 2 years contract extension with Sprint (I'm in the process to move to a different provider)Bottom line: HTC M8 is a good phone, and maybe I'm one of the \"lucky\" guys that I had a defective device.

There really aren\u2019t too many negative things that I can say about the htc one m8.  First lets talk about the build which is easily the best in its class.  The One m8 all metal chassis really is a work of art and its an incredible improvement compared to the one m7 which in itself was beautifully designed.  When you look at an One m8 it really looks and feels like a device you spent $700 dollars on.Second is the UI or user interface.  Typically any android device that has some sort of UI overlay tends to suffer to some degree in the performance department but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with the One m8 running sense 6.  It is easily the smoothest running device I have ever used.  You click on an app, any app, and it opens immediately.  Also switching from app to app is just as snappy with absolutely no lag whatsoever regardless of how many apps you throw at it.  Sense also doesn\u2019t throw all sorts of useless features at you, you have a simple overlay that should meet the needs of any smarthphone user without getting too crazy on useless gimmicky features you would otherwise not use on a regular basis if at all.Third, lets talk about those front facing speakers, I don\u2019t know why on earth more OEM\u2019s haven\u2019t gotten on board with front stereo speakers.  Regardless of whatever comes on the phone, the boomsound speakers on the One m8 by itself is enough of a reason to get this phone.  It isn\u2019t just about the loudness of the speakers but the actual quality of the audio and it pretty incredible considering the size of these speakers.  I really hope this is something htc will continue to improve on because I don\u2019t think I will ever own another device without front facing stereo speakers.Fourth, that camera.  Yes, most other reviewers seem to knock the One m8 camera because of it being \u201conly 4mp\u201d but don\u2019t let that fool you.  The One m8 is capable of taking some pretty good looking high quality photo\u2019s.  Not only that but it takes superb photos in medium to low light as well where most of its competitors will struggle in the same lighting conditions.  Same goes for video, an excellent all around camera that is more than capable of handling taking videos in almost any lighting condition effortlessly.  One thing to add about the camera which I think many take for granted is the time it takes for it to focus, it happens in a fraction of a second and while other camera are taking their time trying to get ready you would have already took 15 plus photos using its burst mode, the whole camera setup is very fast and very easy to use.  I am even willing to say that the camera on the One m8 is arguably one of the best \u201call around, most versatile\u201d smartphone camera\u2019s on the market to date.Finally, the battery life.  The One m8 comes with a 2600mah battery.  At first I was a little disappointed that it only came with that much, I was hoping it would have around 3000mah but using using the device on a daily basis I can see how surprisingly easy the One m8 is on the battery.  With light to medium use I can easily get a day and a half or so out of it before having to charge it up and for those days that I can\u2019t get to a charger it has an extreme power saving mode to help whatever juice you have left to last that much longer.  For me though, on a typical work day, I would probably send and receive 50 to 75 texts and emails with an hour worth of phone calls while streaming Pandora for at least half the day and by the end of my shift I will still be sitting around 40% to 50% of battery left which is amazing in my opinion.To wrap up, I think htc did a fantastic job taking what worked with the One m7 and improving on what didn\u2019t quite work to come up with what we see on the One m8.  As a user of several android devices the m8 is easily my favorite device to use and to hold, can\u2019t wait to see what the m9 will bring.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Premium phone worthy of your upgrade", "Author": "USCarlos", "ReviewID": "R3P9MMSP6VSYN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for two months now and have thoroughly enjoyed it from the start.

That's when I switched from my iPhone 3G to a Samsung S3.  At first I liked my S3, but in time I found it was failing in several key areas... although the specs were good on it's camera - the camera produced lifeless images.  The UI of the Samsung had a lot of issues for me and it was loaded with tons of carrier/samsung apps that were killing my performance.I just recently upgraded again to a HTC One M8.  I reviewed it against the S5.  There's a lot of Samsung people who seem to have a need to knock this phone - especially for the camera.  I have to say, I don't see the limitation. I realize it's only a 4Megapixel camera, but it's quality is pretty amazing. It's immediate usefulness is also nice.  Just click, shot taken.  Instant refocus using ufocus ... the Zoe video maker is pretty slick too.uFocus:It's basically a social camera.  It's not going to give you images you are going to turn into canvas wall art at 11x17\" or larger.  It can't do that with a  4 MP camera.  Nor will it produce Super HDR Video.  But what it will do is give you fun social tools - like the camera... it's ufocus is much better then the other alternatives I've tried.  Samsung has a selective focus, which you do post photo. I found it failed to be accurate 80% of the time I used it. Most images I see with it, have large parts of the background in focus, along with the foreground.  That isn't to suggest that uFocus is 100%... it fails too at times, but at a much lower scale - i find somewhere around 10% of my shots have issues with uFocus.  There's ways to work around the limitation, but you may still get some non defocused material showing up. However Samsung's selective focus is pretty bad, leaving large sections of background mixed with foreground - and a lot more often.  Google Camera has a defocus ability... but it requires a lot of work.  You have to take multiple shots. You start out with the first shot, then move your camera upwards while it takes more shots.  It gets a good result, ONLY if you do it right.  I found in the lighting in my living room it wouldn't even work.  This of course won't work for fast moving targets (like kids!)  If you have kids running around and you are trying to use Google Camera to get the defocus, it's most likely it won't work, the'y'll have moved out of the frame by the second or third shot it takes.  What I've read/seen in the new Xperia Z2 coming out, is that their defocus requires an actual mode you go into.  Then you take two shots.  It then lets you blend the images, and it merges the focus/defocused images per your liking.  In the HTC One uFocus: it's simple... you have to be in Auto mode and you take a picture.  That's it.  You click and it refocuses.  There are limitations... 1) you can't refocus if the image was taken in a special mode  2) you can't refocus if the image was altered and saved out (you loose the depth info if you adjust the image and save it)  3) if the light is too low it may not work.  4) if you use a flash it won't work.  I found it worked in my living room, using nominal lighting (at night).  But if you are in a dark resturaunt, the image you take may not be refocus able.  it just depends on those above factors.For all daytime shots, I never had a problem.  For all shots in doors I didn't have a problem (where Google Camera did have a problem.)Zoe:Zoe is pretty slick.  You go into your images, and it will select random ones and apply a music soundtrack and video effect to them.  You can also pick the images/video you want, and then the theme and music (even your own music) and it will apply a cool flowing video from your content. It's really impressive.Could a person do better with post processing software like iMovie?  Maybe... but then you'd also have to download the video/pictures, get some music together, put it together yourself and adjust all the effects, movements, zooms, etc.  Zoe is there to give you a quick and fun video of your content... not be an aftereffects replacement.UI:I love the UI.  I never liked the Samsung S3 UI.  The UI on Samsung S3 was confusing for many people who used my phone... they found it too confusing to do basic things like send a text message... why?  Because the carrier + samsung + android all have their own software to do each thing... so you had like 3 ways to do almost everything.  You are constantly asked \"do you want this to be your default software choice in the future?\" and no matter what you say you'll get prompted again for the same action tomorrow!Not so with the HTC One M8.  I have the T-Mobile version, and it has little carrier apps... and the apps and UI work together... It doesn't feel like 3 different parties are living on your phone and not working congruently together (like my old Samsung.)  It is so slick, that my wife who is an avid iPhone user... was thinking this looked more fun to use then her 5S.What about all the hype on the camera not being as good as a iPhone/S5 etc?Ignore what people are saying... reviews that deal with 100% crop sharpness are pointless. You want to see what the best this camera can do, not the worst.  My advice... go to flickr.com and do a search for \"htc one m8\" and see the images and video that come up.  Do that for any phone/camera you are considering.  Many times you'll see pictures straight out of the camera with no post processing.  Look at uFocus and decide if the results you see look pleasing.  Check out Zoe on youtube of Viemo and see if they have results that are pleasing.Slo-motion video:it also does slow motion video... I found it does a great job at this, but you are limited to 720p at slow motion. Other cameras probably shoot slow motion at higher resolution.  So if that's important, it may be a drawback.Dual Camera shots/video:Something I don't see reviewed/mentioned often is the dual camera capture... there is a mode where it will shoot video or take still images with both the front and back cameras... it's pretty cool. That way people can see the main footage, and your face cam at the same time.selfie camera is 5mp:I don't do much selfies, but again, to the social aspect of the camera... the selfies are 5MP (one of the highest around.)  It's also a wide angle lens... so it captures more then the back lens.Camera Settings:I don't know if the S5 does this, but the camera can be saved out as different cameras - each version having it's own settings... like you could have a low light camera setting saved, a camera with +2EF saved, etc.  Then you click the named camera with those settings and are instantly in that mode.Guesture controls:if you have the camera in landscape lift it up, and click the volume button, it goes straight into camera mode.  pretty fast access to the camera.Downsides:  - main camera is only 4MP, but... the main limitation here is no zoom or cropping later.  - HDR Video (I haven't tried, but from what I've seen) is flickery and awful.  - slow motion is only 720pUpsides:  - Awesome back camera (despite neg. reviews)  - selfie camera is 5mp  - Great social features (that's what this phone is all about.)  - Slick UI (even my wife who is an avid iPhone user is drawn to this phone.. the first time an android every was pleasing for her to use)  - metal construction feels great.  - uFocus works pretty well compared to it's rivals (Samsung's selective focus, Google Camera and the Z2.)", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beware Buying throught This Avenue", "Author": "C L Jarrett", "ReviewID": "R3URX9S1SFLZF7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When my phone arrived the higher button on the right side was rattling.

There are lots of great reviews and comparisons of the M8 out there. I want to address two specific issues I've had in less than two weeks that indicate HTC's quality control is not doing a good job - both involve the screen.Dead screen in under ten days: My first phone's screen died less than ten days after the phone arrived. I turned on the phone when I woke up and there were lines streaking down the screen, like a bad electronic connection. Within ten minutes the screen was dark. I could receive calls because I knew where the answer icon was, but that was it.Screen polarized along wrong plane: I ran to the Sprint store and they luckily had two M8s in stock. I swapped out my first phone as defective and walked out with my new M8. As soon as I got in my car I realized there was a problem. As soon as I put on my polarized sunglasses I couldn't see the screen in upright/portrait mode! When I turned it sideways/landscape I could see the screen fine. This was not an issue on my first M8. I went back into the Sprint store and the only other M8 they had also had bad polarization.If you don't wear polarized glasses, the bad polarization won't be an issue for you, but between that and the dead screen on my first phone it points to quality control issues at HTC.I love my M8. The problem is it's pathetic that HTC can't get the polarization right. (95% of the time I use my phone in the upright position. I doubt I'm unusual in this respect.) Oh yeah, the screen dying was a slight issue as well. Yes, I could take my sunglasses off whenever I need to do something on my phone, or I could turn it sideways; but that is a ridiculous solution (one proposed by an HTC tech).If HTC and Sprint address the issue and replace my phone with one with proper polarization I will instantly upgrade my review to 5 stars and add more details.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "sprint network sucks", "Author": "Jhery", "ReviewID": "RSCWRF0F5K4UI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Okay I've head this phone for maybe 4 days with Sprint and the first day it disconnected from the network and could not reconnect for anything only way to fix that is to restart the phone which may not seem like a big deal but today only I've had to restart it maybe 7 times 3 of which being in the same hour the phone is amazing but sprints network is too unreliable as of right now if you do not believe me Google HTC one m8 connectivity issues it appears that I'm not the only one with the problems IT IS NOT THE PHONES FAULT BECAUSE IT IS GOOD,AMAZING IN FACT but the network I chose was obviously a mistakeUPDATE as of 4-25 : well the phone runs on Sprint spark which is fairly new and Sprint hasn't fully finished bringing it to all the cities of the US and well it's only in about 7 (guessing maybe a few more) cities if you're in those seven you're lucky if not well you'll be fairly upset but if they do bring the spark network in it'll be the fastest network out there but they need to speed things up", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Brilliant buy!!", "Author": "Parth", "ReviewID": "RLT6CQYKA4MRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using HTC One M8 since one year and it is a brilliant phone with great functionality.

The best thing about the handling is it is very comfortable in hand if you are using it without a hands-free. The battery backup is also very good and would keep you tension free as it lasts really long.Most of the other phones you come across may have issues with the software as you may experience lag and time to time slow interface but with this set you will never experience such disruptions. With good amount of RAM and memory size you can be rest assured that no such problem will arise. HTC once again is spot on in it's product, may it be the picture or the sound quality it exceeds my expectation. The dual front facing speakers are really very good and awesome clarity to beats and you can also change the presets to the way you want.The physical appearance is slick and tough with less worries if you accidentally drop the phone.I can say that the phone is worth each and every penny and it's a must buy if you are looking for a phone in this price range.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice sleek designed phone", "Author": "Violet F", "ReviewID": "R3GL7JG31QXGRI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So far I enjoy this phone I think it takes a bit of getting used to especially from switching from an iPhone to HTC android but overall it has been pretty decent some of the key functions are a little strange and they are a bit touchy and small keys so sometimes ill have a hard time typing or doing whatever correctly because of this but thank god for auto correct.

I've had different HTC phones all the way back to the original HTC Evo 4g for Sprint, back on their wimax 4g.  My problem with those HTC phones is that they don't hold any value, whatsoever.

A Samsung Galaxy S4 trades in for around $140!HTC and it's fans can call the Galaxy \"cheap plastic\" all they want, but I think those numbers speak for themselves.  To be fair, one of the newer HTC One's trades for like $120, but that came out in Feb of last year.Also, Amazon's pricematching for cell phones kind of sucks.  It's one of 2 categories they claim they are willing to pricematch, but it has to be from a select list of online retailers.  However, if you have to go into the store to get a low price at one of those retailers, they will not price match.
