{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Phone for the Moola", "Author": "C. Hawke \"oldmoviequeen\"", "ReviewID": "R24MEI4X13JMIP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is plenty of phone for those who want nice little extra features without going android.  Fairly low EMF, functional camera that is not all that bad really for just taking fairly close up phone shots.  Decent sound but does take a bit of getting used to as the sound quality itself projects differently than on some cellphones. Hard to explain but you almost want to figure out where the speaker is on it, precisely! Speaker phone is adequate if you are in a quiet setting.  I don't use the other functions but they are all there including the web and blue tooth.  Hubby uses the bluetooth on his for driving and says it works fine.  Size is sturdy if you don't like the super slim phones that easily slip out of older fingers and will just fit tidily into a backpocket.  Ringer is nice and loud at full volume and can be turned down to the point it only vibrates.  The vibration will catch your attention in a pocket for sure but can also make it jump off a counter so keep it away from the edges of surfaces.  Front display is good sized and clear and the well lit keypad is large enough even for middle agers to be pleased with.  Nice size photo display inside also for placing your favorite snaps of loved ones.  We have had ours several months without any notable issues using Tmobil.  If they last as long as the previous Samsungs we will be more than happy with this purchase also.  Plain phone for plain good use; nothing more and nothing less.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "gus", "ReviewID": "RUS8HVZUXDJ52", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great phone for the price.
