{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone at a decent price, beware of other biased reviews.", "Author": "Gold Fish Lung", "ReviewID": "R18LOK7YBSILNO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I'm reading some reviews on the Treo 750 and it seems all the negative reviews are by people who are completely incompetent with technology and using Google.  Let me first warn anyone who is technologically handicapped, do not buy this phone.  You will get lost in all the OPTIONS, that are available within the phone.On with my review:Windows Mobile can do basically everything you want, just not in the prettiest manners.  Upon receiving my Treo 750, it came with Windows Mobile 6.  It worked well but had some slight bugs, so I upgraded to 6.1 which also has bugs but none that bother me.  6.1 is definitely snappier than the bundled version of windows mobile 6.  You WILL NOT find the upgrade on Palm's Website, you'll need to Google this.Call Quality: 8/10Calls are crisp and clear. I have no problems hearing the other person in a busy street, and they have no problems hearing me.  Although the speaker phone is slightly distorted at higher volume.Battery Life: 8/10Windows mobile devices and any other smart phone/pda (ie. Iphone, Blackberry) are known to have battery life that doesn't last.  This is because of the processing power in these devices.  The Treo has a 312mhz processor.  My first Pentium II computer had a 300mhz processor.  Seriously, what do you expect?  My experience with the treo is that it will last me an entire day with heavy usage, but when I have it on standby (meaning not using it for anything) the battery last for at least 2 to 3 days.Overall Design: 7/10It's a little thick but this phone came out in Dec 2007, so it's not surprising.  The curves on the side make it feel thinner than it really is and makes the phone feel very nice in your hand.  The rubbery feel of the body is nice, and not slippery.  The small keys take getting use to, but once you do, you type extremely fast.  The screen is nice, bright, and big, but I wish it was at least 320x320 instead of 240x240.Usability: 8/10Windows Mobile is a powerful operating system, there are programs to do basically anything, but it isn't all in one place like you have it on the Android phones or Iphone.  There are thousands of free programs and others are paid.  I personally don't need any programs that you need to pay for.Cons:- Windows Media player will absolutely not goto the next song in the play list unless you have the ringer set to on instead of vibrate.- In 6.1, the screen is still enabled when you press the power button to view the time while in locked mode.-Interface isn't fun to look at.-Lacks wi-fiConclusion:I'm waiting for version 6.5 and 7 of windows mobile to come out which drastically changes the way Windows Mobile looks and also includes a app store.  If you can get this phone for under $200, i would say do it.  If you like to text message, the threaded sms is great.  Few bugs in the OS but doesn't affect the overall usage.  And the amount of software available for windows mobile is overwhelming.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excelent phone, great price!!!", "Author": "C. Molina Colina \"C. M.

Hurt \"Loving Husband and Father\"", "ReviewID": "R3M722JV2G0RW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the Palm 750.  It is a great durable phone that works well in a 3G environment.  Finding SD Ram in \"Mini\" format is still easy, but may require a bit of a challenge in vendor location, due to very few providers using \"Mini\" SD cards any longer.  Kingston, a memory manufacturer, makes an adapted that fits the \"Micro\" SD card, which is now the standard for all 3 and 4 G phone.  The Palm Treo 750 is a hardy phone and will take some abuse with a flexible stylus that stays in place.  The phone could use a little better camera but does offers unlimited video sizing instead of the maximum 30 seconds some other phones limit you to.  The Palm Treo 750 does not require using the Palm interface software, although it is available through Palm store.  In fact, the Palm Software store has a section for the unlocked Palm 750 which is great.  Downside to the phone is that the screws will work themselves loose from time to time around the case, but that is a small fix, with a little hex head driver and just a quick check every few weeks will keep everything manufacturer tight.  Keeping the phone' case helps the phones performance tremendously.  Microsoft software Mobile 6.0 is good enough and interfaces with Google apps with only minor bugs.  To summarize, I love this phone over the smeary touch screen phones.  I suppose, for the price of this unlocked phone it is a great deal for the person who uses the windows office features to stay organized.  Great primary or back up phone.  Just let your provider know, if you switch back say from an android phone to your old trust worthy Palm750 Treo.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worst phone ever!", "Author": "Wendy W.

Andrews \"Sunsh!ne\"", "ReviewID": "R3DWNV8MWRDTKZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well, it does the job. It is a wonderful pda. As a phone, I have to say that it has a few things left to be desired. For instance, the clarity of the phone is just not that good. I have seen cheaper phones with great clarity.By now, I would have thought that the size would have decreased. It is still a bit large.The feature that I have not figured out is the hold button. When you are on the phone and have an incoming call, you switch over. But, when you switch back to the original caller, it still keeps the second caller on hold - even if you chose to hang up. All the while, you see the minutes adding up - go figure.What I do like is all those features. When there is something that I do not understand, I simply go and chat with someone at palm.com. They will usually walk you thru whatever issue you have.Because of so many features and having the ability to hot sync, I will certainly keep the phone - it is a small price to pay.", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Hardware ok, but OS is horrible", "Author": "Nikhil Jaisinghani", "ReviewID": "R1MF0DLXETBBFF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Im a long time treo user and have had 2 600s, 2 650s, and a 680. I was happy with each and still have an old 650 (bigger than the 680 but has lasted so long I have to say it may be the overall best treo). I ordered this as an upgrade and because I found out I could use an external wifi card that fits into the mini sd slot. I was a bit worried about using Windows Mobile but willing to give it a try. The first one arrived but didnt work. Ive had the second one for a few months and must say the functionality and ease of use of the Palm OS was completely lost with the transition to Windows Mobile. It takes longer to get to applications, notifications appear and disappear too quickly (hanging up after a call can trigger the closing of any notification that comes as a result of the call you just made), the screen unlocks on its own at times and makes calls from my pocket, I cant see how long previous calls were for or what time they occurred at, the today screen is messy, and the mini sd slot is less usable than a full size sd slot (since I have plenty of sd cards but no mini sd cards). Alarms take more steps to set, I still dont know how to set shortcuts though I havent dedicated lots of time to trying, and the sync application is a pain in the butt. It took days and some creative computing to transfer my contacts from my 680 to my 750. Menus dont include the full set of options youd like to see. To lock the screen you have to exit out of any applicaiton you are using, return to the today screen, and then lock the screen. It has been an enormous disappointment. The rubber exterior is nice but other than that there is little difference in the hardware. Ive given up and just bought a replacement 680 on amazon a few minutes ago. If you are buying this because you like treos and are looking for an upgrade, I strongly advise against it.", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Quirky", "Author": "S. Roberts", "ReviewID": "RUAKRL9XO7881", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I ordered this Palm Treo I intended to use it strictly as a phone, for messaging and taking pictures. There are other features I could also use like notes, calendar and calculator. I found the device is very quirky. It keeps turning on in my pocket, dialing and performing other functions.When I want to make a call it won't go through. It continues to say it's dialing but nothing happens. Also, I don't hear anything when I try to call, like the line is dead. When I put my sim card in, it read the numbers I had on the card, but the phone acts dead.Some of my phone numbers had to be put in manually. Thats when i noticed that some letters are not registering when I hit the key, so I have to backspace and put them in again. Apparently all the letters do work, but not all the time. I typed in several numbers and it continues to skip letters each time.It does show that I should be picking up towers, two is the most I could get, while I do get more with my old phone. I don't have a landline so I need my phone to be reliable, which this is not.This is very unreliable for the two main purposes I need this, as a phone and for messaging. I don't know if the problem is with the Palm Treo, this particular unit, or part of the problem is T Mobile, but whatever the reason, this phone does not work for me.

After about a month of searching I specifically choose this phone as it fulfills a number of roles that others just (surprisingly) don't.1.  Brand-new, unlocked GSM models are floating around at rock bottom prices (I picked mine up for $100 USD).2.  The Treo 750 remains one of the only affordable, unlocked GSM models that has both a manual QWERTY keyboard and a touch-screen.3.  It's international.  The GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz bands will provide you with 3G capability in most countries.  Most people don't bother to check their band options...such capabilities are extremely important if you travel internationally in order for you to enjoy all aspects of your phone.Yeah, it's a bit big compared to the latest stuff and even with WindowsMobile 6.1 installed, it runs slower.  But come on...the latest unlocked GSM phones run upwards of $800-1000USD!

Honestly, this phone makes me miss my old Nokia 5190 brick just because of its simplicity. The Treo is a pretty decent PDA and good for making calendars, but the sync function (especially via Bluetooth) is pretty bad, and its cell phone capabilities are even worse.The most important function of a phone - picking up calls - simply DOESN'T WORK. If you are writing a text message or trying to call someone and receive an incoming call, the whole phone freezes for about 30 seconds and just sits there. I have missed more calls in the last 8 months than the last 8 years because of this phone. It just doesn't pick up! I personally blame Windows mobile for making the whole thing sluggish and unusable.

You cannot personalize the desktop with icons, or I haven't figured it out yet.2.  I haven't been able to figure out how to get the call log on the desktop menu.3.  There seems to be buttons with no real purpose unless you program them.4.  It doesn't sync with the old operating system, so all the information, call logs, etc are lost.5.  I see no advantage over the Palm OS...windows for mobile doesn't load any faster, pick up email any faster.6.  The OS is larger, leaving less space on the HD and is prone to freezing.I would not recommend this device to anyone who likes the Palm OS...this system, device is awkward to use, not user friendly, is hard to dial..", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "unlocked Treo 750", "Author": "Steve49", "ReviewID": "R2JWZFK260NAPC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phone came as advertised and before scheduled--excellent.
