{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For once a fast Android phone with no lag!", "Author": "Kayla", "ReviewID": "ROZ2971BNY8PC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is the best straight talk phone (in the less than $400 price range) on the market. It has a great size screen, android 4.0 operating system, and a good design (no cheap plastic look/feel). One of my favorite things about the phone is they seem to have everything geared towards google instead of bing (score)!!! It runs on Verizon towers so I have great service everywhere I go. It has a 5mp camera which is good for its price range but unfortunately it does not have a flash. I recently switched from Verizon to straight talk to save money and let me tell you, this baby blows my laggy lg revolution out of the water when it comes to speed. It opens/closes apps quickly, surfs the web quickly and with no problems, and you dont get the annoying system crashes and errors android is known for. It's nice to have a phone that actually functions as a phone rather than a paperweight. It has very limited memory but if you save your apps to your sd card and get a good task killer (I use \"advanced task killer\" - you can set it up to automatically kill apps youre not using), it will run smoothly. The battery life is average for a smartphone but it charges pretty fast - it can go from dead to full charge in 2 hours. Another thing I love about this phone is it has a data on/off button conveniently on the pull down menu so it's not a hassle to turn the data off when im not using it (which greatly extends battery life). Overall, this phone is great and a force to be reckoned with even when compared to the most expensive phones on the market. I would recommend it to anyone who has ever wanted to smash their laggy phone against a wall.Let's recap: Pros Android 4.0 Low price Verizon network Fast/no lag or crashes Runs netflix/hulu smoothly Google search/chrome Data on/off toggle on pull down menu Charges quickly Large screenCons No flash on camera Low memory - can be easily fixed by storing apps to sd card (not included) and getting a task killerAnd by the way, dont pay $300 for this phone. It is only $150 on walmart.com and straight talk's website.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Huawei big name in global market, just not in USA", "Author": "zoo kat", "ReviewID": "R57CU9MU0U6KR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did some research on the brand, and discovered Huawei is a Chinese brand, and they are the world's 6th biggest manufacturer of cell phones. They have more market share than HTC, Sony, TCL, Blackberry, and Motorola, only slightly less than LG and ZTE, and 1/3 that of Apple. By the way, It's pronounced \"WAH-way\" and the 881C is a very nice phone. Don't be scared off by a brand you've never heard of. I am thinking most people will hear of them soon in the USA.This is my 4th ST phone and my second android. My previous android was a low end LG. The experience with this phone is 3X better than the previous. So far it runs every ap smoothly, Runs Youtube videos without a glitch when signal is 2 bars or more (though there may be some buffering at the beginning). This phone runs on Verizon which is much better and faster in the area where I live, rural Michigan. I should have been on Verizon long ago.The look and feel of this phone are quality. The 4\" display is beautiful and it's a good blend; big enough screen yet still small enough to fit in a pocket. It feels thin and sleek and not bulky. While I would not claim this to rival an I-phone it does have that look and feel and a similar experience. Compared to an iphone it's 500% cheaper and almost as good in my opinion. No brainer. For the $$ you will be hard pressed to find a better bang.Do yourself a favor and buy a micro SD card immediately (well under $10). Then go into \"Settings, Storage, Default storage location\" and set the SD card as the default storage location for installed aps. This will prevent you from running out of memory quickly by installing too many aps, as there is not much extra internal memory.The only area I would appreciate a little more performance is with the battery life. The phone has a 1750 mAh battery, which is big. However, battery performance is just average. Not a deal breaker, if you want a fancy phone with the bells and whistles this is the price you pay. Having a charger in the office or car to top it off is nice to have with this phone.We shall see how this phone does over time. My LG developed lots of bugs and glitches after a while. So far this phone has exceeded expectations. If you want a great Android on ST through Verizon this phone will not dissapoint. I doubt there currently an ST phone that delivers more bang for the buck", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "lildude", "ReviewID": "R22YJ23L66TMY9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy with this phone, been using it for about a week now and have had no issues with it at all and don't anticipate any. Very pleased with the camera as that is one of my priorities in a phone. The only minor problem was activating it online only because it is so new (just released 2 months ago and just now in Walmart stores). Had to call ST customer service to activate it as the ST website popped up a warning saying it was not compatible in my area even though it uses Verizon towers. The activation went quick and easy and the customer service was very pleasant. Looking for a case and holster for this particular new phone has proven to be very challenging :(", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Huawei Ascend Plus", "Author": "lisarrt", "ReviewID": "R15C55QDV8TDKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this phone for about 6 months now. Great phone at a great price:)Can't beat the screen size and only 149.00!!!", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mine is a Page Plus Cellular product", "Author": "Danny K", "ReviewID": "RTS5KO9GVJYV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I realize this review site is for the Net 10 Huawei Ascend, but since I have the same phone from Page Plus I thought I would share my thoughts. I purchased this phone from Page Plus Cellular which uses the Verizon network. So far the phone is very nice. My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone on the VirginMobile / Sprint network. The Samsung phone would reset itself constantly and the it damaged my SD card also the Sprint network at my location was terrible. So back to the Huawei Ascend Plus, screen is bright, has a nice rubberized feel. First thing to do which this phone is to install a SD Card! I installed a 32gb micro sd card. Remove back cover and you will see the install location above the battery. Next set the phone to use the SD card for the apps instead of the internal memory) THIS IS A MUST WITH THIS PHONE! due to its low internal memory. Just go to settings, storage and click on default storage location and set it for SD Card. Next I set the phone to connect to my home wi-fi and downloaded  26 of my favorite apps. There is an app called Super tool box 10+. Use it, it will clear your cache, free your memory and do many more things for free. I've used it for years on all my android phones. Now back to the phone. Phone is fast and works perfectly so far! MP3 player sounds great, I use the Poweramp app for music. Videos play well, I use the free MX player for videos. (Set it to use SW codec). The phone only handles 3G data , but on the Verizon network it blows away my old Sprint network. Phone calls are clear and I am now connected in areas I could not get a connection before. This Phone with the Verizon network just works well!UPDATE: Still using the micro SD card I am up to 34 apps on my 5 screens + the apps that came with the phone that I don't use. I've added 2x battery for power saving (shuts on and off the data at a frequency that you select) I've added super keyboard app (I feel it is a better keyboard than what came with the phone) I added Zedge app which gives many many ringtones to choose and more. Phone Reception monitor that give me a digital read out of the Verizon cell signal. I added Waze which may be the best GPS app out on the android market. Who says this phone doesn't hold much!! And its still fast and working great! Don't forget to open Super tool box and run and erase your cache from time to tome. Love this phone with the Verizon network!Second UPDATE: I am now well over 40 apps with NO PROBLEMS. My internal memory ram for apps is at 250mb. I am impressed with the battery life! Blows away my old Samsung S11. I bought a 4.2 volt Life Tech battery charger (which is the max voltage for this Huawei Ascend Plus H881c battery) Just remove the back of the phone, and battery,  insert the pins of the charger on the + and - of the battery (polarity does not matter the charge will adjust)When the charge stops blinking you are charged. I purchased an extra battery and now I switch them in the morning before going to work. To show how long it lasts, I put the phone on my belt at 4:30am and check emails, listen to my music etc while com-mutating to work at 12:10pm lunch time I am at 98%. Crazy good!", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good budget device", "Author": "sonic6422", "ReviewID": "R2VGIZHTMNNOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1.0 GHz dual core CPU, 512MB of RAM, 2GB internal storage + (empty) SD card slot, 800x480 screen, Android 4.0.4 are the basic specs on this device. The first thing that jumps out at you is that it's almost bone stock Android ICS, which is good if you don't like the usual assortment of useless bloatware. The only add-on app seems to be the FM tuner, which actually does work.It's all plastic, but has a good solid feeling and is comfortable in the hand. The screen, while not very high-res or a fancy OLED, has good color and looks reasonably sharp. Performance is generally quite good thanks to ICS and the lack of bloat apps, but it can sometimes get choppy scrolling high-content web pages and a little vague on the touch-screen sensitivity. Reception seems very good, right up with Motorola's I've had in the past. The voice quality is however average, and the speakerphone is quite poor. Battery life is exceptional, a full day of heavy use, a couple days of moderate use, and four or more days of light use. This assumes that you don't load up with apps that constantly drain the battery. The only major, obviously negative is lack of a camera flash (i.e. flashlight).A major concern of mine was the screen glass / plastic, but it's held up ok after three months. Nothing else has fallen apart or otherwise failed. Other features, like bluetooth pairing for hands-free calling work fine, even with the notoriously fickle Audi system, so I assume it will work with most vehicles. Rooting was easy with SRSRoot, and you can USB tether as well, at your own risk of course. Wi-fi hotspot does not seem to work at all, I assume because it was never a feature this device was designed to have being Straight Talk branded.If you want an Android ICS device on Verizon with pre-paid, this is your ticket. Verizon has, perhaps intentionally, made it very difficult to get an ICS or higher phone activated on Page Plus without fiddling with a used 4G phone. You can find tax-free 90 day refills for Straight Talk at slightly less than retail on eBay, bringing the price down to almost $40 / month. That less than half of the basic $80 plans with Spring or AT&T; (after taxes & fess), and nearly one-third of Verizon post-paid. The only question is whether you can live with 3G speeds, and how well Verizon will maintain their 3G network. I'll sit on the fence with a cheap pre-paid plan until they get serious about pricing and loan shark level subsidies for the cool phones. The Samsung Centura is another option, but this device has far superior hardware and features for only $50 more.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "4 months in and it just stopped working.", "Author": "Pamela Neville", "ReviewID": "R3A8EZPFYXF93P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I first got this phone, I loved it. It has a sleek design for the price, had all the features I wanted, and I got really good reception. I mean, not a lot of storage space or RAM but I made it work for my budget. I've had it for about 4 months and didn't mistreat it. I don't overcharge it or anything like that, the battery was holding a decent charge still too...But then it just kind of stopped working. I noticed that as it was getting around 10% battery life the other day, it started to get really hot but I didn't think too much of it. When I got in the car I put it on the charger but it wasn't gaining any charge, although it said it was plugged in, and the battery would heat up when on the charger. Eventually I took it off to cool down, took the battery out and all that, and put it on the charger a couple hours later and it would heat up and the red light that shows it was charging kind of flickered uncontrollably, but I could never turn it on. I'm really disappointed, because I have no idea what went wrong.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "A GREAT PHONE!!!!", "Author": "Sherri", "ReviewID": "R17ZWBUU2LJMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone works very good. the OS is Ice Cream Sandwich and works great. but some apps can take a while to load. It might lag sometimes but not all the time. It also plays games very good most of the time. But i am just saying if you're attached to Itunes i'd prefer an Iphone. And the camera lag when you open it at first but it takes a while to load. So if you don't like android DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!! But overall this is a great phone.

The first month was great but after that, things went down hill. It randomly drops calls and closes out of apps, occasionally wont charge or will drain the battery when put on the charger, has random pop ups, over heats very easily, wont save anything it the SD card and has very little phone storage, will not pull up the phone dial pad but when it does it has a delay when dialing, also it won't call people without closing out of the phone app first and waiting for one to two minutes, the camera also has a delay and the picture quality is not good at all! But the only good thing I can say about this phone it that it does not break easily. I have dropped it several times without a case and it has not broke and that is the only reason I have kept it around!

The phone quality is ok and it has some nice features. It had some initial drawbacks as well. The camera takes a while to get into focus, and once in focus doesn't stay that way for long. I consider it a cheap phone.I've come to consider it, in terms of ability to use apps, e-mail, and text,as almost worthless. As others have said, there is not enough RAM memory quickly.  There is a lot of bloatware, and many google apps which cannot be moved to an SD card, and constant updates either for those apps, e-mail or others (facebook), that completely clog RAM.The result is tasks like checking e-mail or using apps become close to impossible.  Almost every time you access it, it will say unable to establish connection, insufficient storage available, and you can't respond.In short, all you can end up using is the phone, camera, and music player, and only on occasions where you have great wifi, some apps and e-mail. I'm not sure which entity deserves more blame, the phone or Google, which clogs the RAM with updates, apps, and bloatware you can't get rid of.This is just like the Microsoft model in it's heyday.  Every computer that rolled out had minimum RAM, causing it to slowdown and crash as time went on and updates and programs got bigger, requiring the consumer to buy a new computer just in time for the rollout of a new Windows version.I don't know whether to blame the phone, or Google, who makes it impossible to get rid of it's apps or reduce memory taken up by its many programs, or straight talk, which is a bait/switch company that throttles internet access very quickly despite offering \"unlimited\" access.

So if you like to keep restarting your phone a few times a day and like having that feeling of smashing your phone into the ground because of beyond frustration well this is the phone if for you.

I thought I had found an excellent phone at a great price, but after that first night it went downhill fast.First, there was not nearly enough storage, I was fine with that, and I purchased a 32gb microsd. Not a problem, a little irritating, but still a great price for a smart phone.Second, the first phone call I made after having the phone for a day I ran into an issue with the other person being unable to hear me. After some googling I found a few people having the same issue. The only fix I found was to restart the phone, which would be all well and good as long as it never happens to you with an important call. This happened 3 times within 8 hours of the first instance.Third, after getting the SD card, moving the things that were filling up the memory is nearly impossible. You have to download a third party app and hope that it doesn't screw up your phone. After all of that, out of nowhere my home screen began crashing. The apps wouldn't show up, and holding the power button down would only get me a flashing shut down menu that I had to play a stupid version of whack-a-button to make sure I could get the phone to restart.A lot of my apps crash with minimal usage, there's no flash for the camera (which isn't a big deal on its own, but with everything else... well I'd at least expect some flash. If nothing else will work, why not that?)In short, if you don't mind restarting your phone often and probably in the middle of trying to do something, it's not THAT bad of a phone. The sound is good on it, and when the screen isn't flashing, the screen is very receptive. It doesn't seem like a lot of other people have trouble with the muting calls problem, so maybe it's just a few defective phones.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Skip this product if possible.", "Author": "Stanley Elkins", "ReviewID": "R9X0WA6FR1PLV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worse phone I have ever used.
