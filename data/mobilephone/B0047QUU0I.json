I'm using it now. Sprint had no problem making it work for me. Only bad thing is if you needed the cd with all the extra programs,(music download, program to sink with your computer...) it wasn't included. I didn't need it as I was replacing the phone sprint couldn't fix or replace. So happy I found a new one I could use. Think I'm going to order a few more so I will have them.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Since it's release", "Author": "Amazon Addict", "ReviewID": "R318IS7QHA4LEH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this model since its initial release with only needing to replace it once, thus far. This purchase will be my third and as long as these phones are around I will continue to buy them. Like the other reviewer mentioned, there are more advanced phones now but this one has everything I need without the pricey data plans. But here's the best part:THIS PHONE CAN TAKE A BEATING!!!!I can't say the same for the new pieces of \"advanced\"/\"smart\" junk. I've dropped this phone in puddles, in the sink while brushing my teeth, down flights of stairs (on more than one occasion), on concrete and other hard surfaces, and it just keeps ticking. There's no way any new phone would be able to survive the way this one has. It has heft and you can feel the durability. The ONLY reason I'm purchasing a new one is bcz at the very bottom (where the wrist strap attaches) snapped off when I yanked it from my tight pocket by the strap to answer a call. That area is a bit exposed, but the phone works just fine. This new purchase is for the day, hopefully not in the near future, this one takes a wrong dive or gets water on it and ruins completely. Until then, I'm keeping my phone. I love this model.", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid Smartphone - Even in 2012", "Author": "Uncle Benny", "ReviewID": "R1I6GSIIXICQ7W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A solid smartphone with all the important basics: messaging, email, maps, etc.  Sprint lists it as a feature phone thus, it does NOT require the pricey smartphone plan.
