Was delivered long before the estimated date of delivery, looks just like the picture. I downloaded Next Launcher 3D from Google play app store and it makes this phone look awesome! Everyone thinks it's the Samsung Note 2 and when I tell them what it really is and how much I paid for it, they all want to get one.I well tell you this:- Do not install Go Locker and use the lock screen that comes with the phone because when it locks and you get a call you will be able to answer the call but after your call ends, you can't unlock the screen it keeps blanking off. I thought it was a problem with the phone so I keep taking out the battery to restart the phone not realizing that having 2 screen locks, the 1 when the phone starts up and the 1 when the phone goes to standby running at the same time seems to be causing the problem of unlock the screen (DUH). When I uninstall Go Locker the phone worked great.5 STARS without hesitation.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Have 2x and a good bang for the buck", "Author": "Derek J.D.", "ReviewID": "R3UPLGAQCAQRRZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Seller: ProKat DVDI purchased two of these units as I was tired of contracts and refuse spending 300-600 on a smart phone out right.Service: T-MobileQuality level: good for making calling but since they have not re-framed my area to 1900mhz only 2g dataHave currently only used 1 sim at a time as I have yet to use it in Canada.I have seen other people complain about signal quality for both cell and wifi data but I have not experienced either issue.Display: overall it is acceptable but off angels are a it tough to see and directly in sunlight is pretty much a no go.  If you're use to hi-res phones you will have to adjust to the lower end display but the screen size does helpStorage:Internal: 2 gig on board, extended description does say 4gb but it is not accurateExternal: 32gb and 16gb confirmed working, have the phone set to load apps to preferred storage SD will save you a lot of painSpeed: if you load everything to SD and have a very slow card, you will take a performance hit.  Now if your familiar with android the device feels fine and really there is no issue with casual gaming on it.  I've tried Asphalt 7, NBA Jam, Riptide 1 and a few others with no lag.OS versions:  mine came with 4.1.1 but my wife's came with 4.0.4, I found this to be a bit puzzling and would like both to be current but all your current apps will still run.  I've been looking at ways to root the device preferably GUI but it seems most have to be flashed (XDA forums has some info but there is no specific board I've found for these devices)Battery life:  I don't have specific times/apps/etc to give you as I don't have the time but for the size of the display I'm fairly impressed with it.  It definitely gets much better battery then my Galaxy Nexus CDMA and if you don't beat the hell out of it gaming you could easily make it through the day.The good: battery life, 2nd battery in the box, an extra back with flip cover, doesn't feel that big (might go 6 inches next go round), bigger displayThe bad:  headset jack is deeper into the phone, trying to find a 3.5mm cable that will fit snug, 4.1.1 on one phone and 4.0.4 on the other, screen protector that came with it seemed way to thick, there are a few apps pre-installed that I could do with out (backgrounds, Docs to go)Overall for $150 you can't ask for much more, maybe the addition of 1700mhz", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good phone", "Author": "upset buyer", "ReviewID": "RID1LI6XB4ZBN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "if you wish to own a samsung note and cant afford it this could be it.its cheap and great i bought one and i am enjoying it .i love mine", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mango Natural Star i9220(n9770) 5.0 Capactive Android 4.0", "Author": "gregory neve", "ReviewID": "R2CH2AT9MWL7VR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone was very nice with a eligant screen and it came with everything including a case.
