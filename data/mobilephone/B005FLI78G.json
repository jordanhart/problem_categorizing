I was so tired of paying so much for my cellphone through \"Big Red\" AND constantly worrying about having a charged phone.  I decided it was time to switch to something smaller, more simple, and hassle free.  You see, I'm kind of weird: I seem to use my cell phone for calling and texting.  I don't need to run 1000 high-speed apps and play all the latest games.  I need to make calls, send texts, and occasionally look something up on the internet or use a quick app like for Redbox or something.  I can do all that with this phone, and get this; my phone lasts for 5 days without having to recharge.  Love this phone!  And no contract; I can swap out SIM cards, take it overseas, etc.  Buy it!!!

When I got it, I was a little surprised to see that it came from Europe, as it had a European charger. There was an EU to US power converter inside the package (but outside of the actual phone box). Another thing that is important to know, is that this phone IS unlocked. For some reason, amazon doesn't make that very clear on their website. I took a gamble and assumed that it was unlocked, and ordered the phone.

I am rating based on the value for the money. This phone is for my son since he had an older feature (basic) phone that finally died. This Galaxy 5360 is a Andriod Smartphone with WiFi and GPS. It is unlocked so it works on my AT&T; network without a data plan. I have the HTC One X, a great phone; however, I cannot find anything that this Samsung Galaxy Y S5360 can't do that my 5 times more expensive phone does. It surfs the net, downloads apps and data, has GPS navigation, a camera, music, voice dialing, fast processor a newer OS (2.3.6 vs my OS 2.3.5.) messaging, video, music, etc. Sure it's smaller and lighter but better for him. It starts fast, long battery life, clear screen and works on any GSM network. I use AT&T; 850 in California and he has no problems. Watch Netflix with stereo headphones in Hi Definition and clear audio, YouTube, video games, conference calling, voice to text messaging and email,....everything the big phones do. I can't believe what a bargain it is. It came fast and when I started it the default language was Serbian/Slavic. The owner's manual was written for Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro. No big deal, just pop in the SIM and the battery and fire it up, choose the language button on the right side of the screen, (not the obvious emergency button) and choose American English or any language you like and that was it; Now its an American Cellphone; we were off to the races. It connected and was ready to go. The wall charger is the European variety but came with an adapter for U.S. and an additional typical Computer USB to (micro-usb) phone cable connector. It did not come with headphones.The headphone jack is the standard 3.5mm type, available anywhere. It uses the standard charger/data cable Micro-USB type and connects to the computer to charge and modify so I use the same charger as my HTC or Blackberry. Like all new phones it ships with the smaller SD card that is only 2GB so I suggest buying a 16GB or 32GB if you want to fill it with photos, videos and music. In this respect it has the same storage capacity as any of the best androids or iPhones. All the features of an expensive phone for 1/5th the price. I am very pleased and so is he.

The order was Sold by OG Wireless (Open Group Wireless).The phone is unlocked, it is Galaxy Y GT-S5360 that is produced for the Far East market and you will not get service from Samsung in US (I tried and they refused to help in anyway).There is no mention to warranty, so, I assume there is no warranty, especially when Samsung people in US will not service this phone.It came in a box and start up menu that are written in Germen. Had to use a dictionary to translate the two options that popped up to determine which one is the word for language setting. That is easy.When I connected it to my Windows XP computer (after installing Samsung Kies) it requested a bunch of drivers that Windows XP could not find anywhere on my computer or on the internet. It showed a few entries on Windows Device Manager screen with a warning mark. Somehow, after restarting the computer and reconnecting the phone, everything works fine and the entries on Windows Device Manager are gone.Overall, I have the phone for 7 days and I like it. It is small and light weight compare to other smart phones, have good Android version (Android OS, v2.3.5 (Gingerbread)). Does not do everything, but good value for the money. Battary lasted about 3 days.Cons:1) The speaker is not laud enough. Not a fit for an environment that is not really quite.If you plan on using it for video chat, you better buy a phone with a front camera - this one has the lens on the back.2) Some software updates dismount the SD memory card, the phone will indicate that there is no SD card, and you have to open the back, pop it out and insert it back in.3) It had 290MB of internal RAM. The number of applications you can install and run at the same time it limited by the RAM size. If you plan on adding more than 5-7 applications, it will probably not be enough for you. The smaller the RAM size, the more you need to go to task manager and clear the RAM from applications you are not using at the moment.4) If you plan on doing video chat, take a phone that have a camera lens in the front (same side of the screen).", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Y value-for-money", "Author": "Alex Racho", "ReviewID": "R5BUPTEZW5LNM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SAMSUNG Y GALAXY S-5360.It's been a few days that I've had this phone.

I don't do much more than calling and texting, so if you don't use too much data, then this phone is great for you. Though I don't use it for much more than it's phone capabilities, plenty of apps work with it, and surfing the web and listening to music are very easy. Simple games like solitaire are great, but games like Angry Birds are best played on something with a bigger screen, though.The most impressive thing for me is the battery life of this phone. I have an iPod touch and am frequently in WiFi zones, so I use that for web surfing and apps most of the time. Because of this, and also because of the phone's efficiency, one single charge lasts for days on the Galaxy Y.

Well, I seem to be one of the forgotten consumers of mobile phones, because with all the bells and whistles phone manufacturers cram on phones these days, they seem to have forgotten that above all else, I just want to make a call on a phone that is, you know, mobile? Samsung Y is everything that I want from a phone: compact size, clear and clean interface that is very easy to use, solid build but very lightweight, and with all the features that you need from a phone (look, if I want a 10mp camera I'll buy a camera).And all these comes at a very affordable price that is, from what I have seen, among the lowest of new generation phones (meaning those released in the last 2 years). So if you, like me, are looking for a phone that goes back to the very reason why we even need a mobile phone in the first place, well look no further. This is the one.

I put in my AT&T; sim card and it works just fine, connect to my home wi-fi and I get full functionality. The only nick I have with it is it came with a European style charger and a US adapter, but I could not get it to charge through the adapter, fortunately I had an adapter lying around, so I was able to plug it in and charge, but other than that its great, not worth deducting a star. They also include a USB cable so I guess you could use one of those 5v USB wall outlets to charge through, though I'll probably end up buying the right charger.  Now I have a nice little android phone, which I can use via wi-fi and still keep my old plan rates. The screen on this phone is fine for emails and such, but I don't know about game play, kind of small I think.

It's Android, so I am able to add apps from the play store. Everything is good, except for these two issues:1. The Android version is 2.3.6 - so Chrome is not supported2. Again, because of the Android version - the phone does not vibrate. There are the options to set the Vibration to \"Always\", \"Never\", \"Only when not Silent\" and \"Only when Silent\". No matter what option I choose, the result is the same - the phone doesn't vibrate. A few folks on the internet asked to check about setting the \"Haptic feedback\", but that option has been disabled/removed for 2.3.6So essentially I have to keep checking the phone every few minutes to see if I missed a call! I tried to research online, and apparently almost everyone is facing the same issues. I plan to try and root it if possible, and if I'm successful, then will update this review again.If it had not been for these two issues, I would given it a solid 5 stars.EDIT 1/22/2013: I had the vibrator issue checked out at a mobile repair shop. The vibrator was faulty and needed to be repaired. However, the reason why I've reduced the no. of stars to 1 is that the person said that someone had already tried to repair the vibrator - scratch marks were evident.In other words, the seller knew that this was a faulty phone, tried unsuccessfully to repair it and still sold it as a \"New\" item.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Y GT-S5360", "Author": "Tony Collins", "ReviewID": "R2W0AR599XP2LH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone worked fine upon arrival. Immediately, out-of-the-box, the following tests were performed:1. WiFi connection: Great. Flawlessly connected to our home wireless router. Also, flawlessly connected to the free WiFi at the famous coffee shop chain and the famous hamburger chain.2. KIES Sync: Flawlessly connected with, and identified by, Samsung's KIES desktop software. Be patient, it may take a minute.3. Outlook Sync: KIES performed a flawless sync between OUTLOOK and the phone, including all Contacts, Notes (Memos) and the built-in phone calendar.4. USB interface worked fine, as evidenced by the USB connection with KIES.The screen is pretty fast and sensitive, and you'll get used to the sensitive keyboard in a short period as you use it for a while.  The multi-touch screen works just fine and have not experienced any lock-ups yet. Some people have complained about the screen size, but with the multi-touch screen you can easily \"pinch-out\" (i.e., zoom in) and read a little easier with the magnified (zommed-in) section.Guys, this is not a sell job for Samsung.  I returned a Samsung Galaxy i5500 Europa within a day because it failed the above tests straight out-of-the-box. This Galaxy Y S5360 passed these tests on the first try for each step. Maybe I just lucked out this time. If you are migrating from Palm, this type of phone might work out good for you.  Export your Contacts and Memos from Palm as Tab Delimited files. Be sure that you highlight all the Palm records that you wish to export.  Import the Tab Delimited files into OUTLOOK.  Take your time to map out the fields for your contacts to make sure you get as close of a cross-over match that you can. It took me about three tries until I resolved the mapping issues and then it imported everything very well.  Then, to protect all of your private information with an extra level of security that you enjoyed in Palm, go to the Android market and evaluate some security applications intented as a secure wallet, e-wallet, password keeper, safe-lock or vault file, where you can securily maintain your passwords, credit cards, and any other sensitive membership or customer-client information.", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty good LITTLE phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2FBDTDR1HGZZX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice little phone.

I needed a 3G Quadband Unlocked phone so I could pick up inexpensive prepaid voice/data sim cards during my travels and not get clobbered with roaming fees. This phone is perfect. It is inexpensive, has most of the important bells and whistles of Android, and just works. It even runs Netflix streaming, though a bit jerky. Talking GPS works great too. I agree with another reviewer that stated it would be a great alternative to an IPOD touch. Even on WiFi without the sim card installed, the phone pretty much was fully functional (obviously no voice). But the best part of all is the built in tethering feature. You can activate the phone so that the phone can share its data service with other devices (with security and encryption if desired). This was vital for me as I need a \"connected\" laptop in these out of the way places. I agree with other reviewers' comments about the small screen and more basic nature of the camera. But at the $120 price point, this phone is a steal!A note regarding my seller \"Open Group Wireless.\" I ordered from the Northeast US on Thursday evening and it came in the US mail (FedEX smartpost) Saturday with my regular delivery. The phone appears to be designed for the UK market as the power adapter had the unique UK style plugs. This didn't bother me at all as 1) the package also included a US style converter plug (in the factory sealed box), and 2) the phone uses the now standard MicroUSB style connector. Most cell phones (and Nooks, Kindles, etc.) use this standard. I have tons of these chargers and in the car. They are super cheap an ubiquitous these days anyway. I would also note that the package from Open Group Wireless came with English instructions (though the phone came with default settings of British English, a quick fix) which is consistent with comments from other reviewers and of course the style of power adapter. Also very important, the sealed package came with a 2GB MicroSD card (with full size SD adapter branded by Samsung). Some other reviewers complained about the lack of an included SD card, but mine came with one. Don't know if this is vendor specific.In summary, I could not be happier, especially for the price paid.

However, I was not able to see my contacts.After playing around with my old phone and the Samsung, I was able to migrate all the content over. It's not just as simple as swap the SIM as it would be between phones on the same service plan. Here are the steps that I took to successfully complete the migration:Copy all contacts to SIM card that required a command entry in my LGCopy all other files to a memory cardCopy individual text conversations that I wanted to keep to the SIM, then import them into the SamsungThis was a trial and error process, but once completed all content was available on the Samsung. The phone works on my AT&T; plan and appears to be fully functional.

The only CON is the 3.5\" screen size.  It is quite small and makes it difficult to type in the vertical mode. However when you turn the phone horizontally the typing pad gets larger and is a lot better to type in. Since I already knew upfront about the screen size it didn't bother me that much. It is actually the average screen size in most phones in the market. The phone did not come with micro SD card and when you try to take pictures it asks you to insert one, so be prepared to get a micro SD card as well.

Nevertheless, I took a chance because he loved the phone. It turned out to be a GREAT product, it came in immaculate condition, absolutely perfect, no scratches or anything and it had the factory package. I tested the phone to ensure the speaker was working, and it was! I did this because the above mentioned seller sent a phone that had a damaged speaker for which I did not replace because the speaker had to be ordered! I live in South America so that explains why I didn't even bother, because the cost to do so was nearly the cost of the phone and time was of the essence. So, my recommendation: buy this phone, it has a clean display, you can download apps hassle free, it is very easy to use and has a slick look. It is a product worth investing in, I would definitely buy from this seller again.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Y Galaxy", "Author": "Sena", "ReviewID": "R2A0ODI7Q5XERG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say that this phone is perfect.

You have to tap on the phone twice to unlock the screen before you can end the call. It's good when the call gets disconnected automatically after you hang up, but if you have to tap on the screen twice to unlock it, it gets annoying.

It was about 60$, it was a Black Berry but pink. I got the Galaxy S it was awesome and I love it! The other phone you could not go on the internet. You could not text very well because the buttons were so small. You could not play any games on the pink phone, but you can on the Galaxy S. It's very nice!  The phone is durable but don't throw it across the room. It's black & big it has a touch screen its rectangle. And has a very nice camera you can change the settings on your camera. It's a fun phone. It has a big screen. Its screen is good to play games on because it is so big. It has very good graphics, which is a nice bonus for the big screen. It has a slide up keyboard. It is pricey about 100$ or more but that's a good price for such a nice phone. And it's big but other than that I like it.  I think the people who would like this kind of phone would be people who want a touch screen and internet and to play games on. Maybe for work and people who want to play games on their phone.  People who could maybe deal with the bigness of it, and who could deal with the price of the phone. People who want a good fun phone from Sprint.
