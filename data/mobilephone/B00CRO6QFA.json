{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Phone is OK, but it is not fully unlocked", "Author": "Jaime Crespo", "ReviewID": "R1DP2SFCJJBUJJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me tell you the truth about this phone, and also about what is being offered vs what you get.  I work in the Telecom market so I know the details about this phone.The phone itself is great. The problem is the type of S4 you are gettingFirst thing, this phone is NOT unlocked, once you insert a SIM card different from ATT, it will tell you that the phone is locked and you need to insert the PIN code.  So if you want to use a different SIM from other carrier-country, you need to find-buy the code from the internet, then the phone is fully unlocked and any SIM will work.Second thing I encounter when trying to use a T-Mobile SIM Card.  The AWS bands of T-Mobile for 3G/4G HSPA+ service are closed so you need to look on the Internet to find a way to open it if you want to have coverage on those technologies.Phone connects to T-Mobile LTE only after I dialed a number !!!Bottom line you are not getting a fully operating unlockable phone that can be used anywhere.You have to play with the configuration and search-change its configuration to make it work as a fully unlocked phone to be used with any SIM Card worldwide.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "AT&T; 4G LTE for $45/mo!", "Author": "Griffin M.", "ReviewID": "R3SN0I8O24GNB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review will be less about the product itself (because we all know this is an amazing, powerful, fast, feature-packed flagship smartphone) and more about SIM Compatibility/Network. Because that's why we're looking at unlocked phones, right?I digress. In June, I bought the Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy SIII from WalMart for $459.99. I thought it an amazing purchase that I would not regret... I was so wrong. Little did I know it was a CDMA phone (locked to Straight Talk) and it ran on the SPRINT network. This meant little to me then, but it means the world to me now, because I now know that Sprint is the most awful, bogged-down, spotty, insert-derogatory-phrase-here network on this entire planet. I live in Hawaii, and Sprint's network in Hawaii is an absolute joke. I had no service at my own house OR my workplace that was right on the convergence line of two Sprint towers (Sprint can't switch towers very easily so just went into roaming). The closest Sprint tower to my house had a coverage radius of roughly 1 mile, and still does. And worst of all, it's a 3G-only network. Not a regular 3G network, either. I got EDGE speeds at best. I've never pulled more than 1Mbps on the up or down. Straight Talk's S3 was also very watered down, with a locked bootloader and very limited software accessibility. It was a sad life for me.I had had it. I was done with this pitiful excuse for a carrier. All my friends had either AT&T; or Verizon, who both had full LTE buildouts here. They always pulled webpages and videos like lightning. Their coverage was broad and consistent. I figured it was time to pinch a few pennies. I had heard that Straight Talk had released an LTE-capable AT&T; SIM Card, and I needed a phone for it to power. I had my heart pretty much set on the S4, but didn't know which one to get.This was the one.The product arrived brand-new and completely unopened. Shiny new S4. I put it in the wall, popped the SIM in, edited the APN settings ([...]) and BAM. The 4G LTE icon popped up in the status bar, as well as two consistent bars of service. My experience thus far has been wonderful - I've been pulling a pretty steady 15up/19down everywhere I've been thus far. I now have coverage in my home. I have yet to see the NO SERVICE icon. This may not be a problem for many of you as you may be already coming from AT&T;'s network - but it's a whole different world for me.TL;DR? This phone works perfectly with Straight Talk's AT&T; Micro SIM card. There is no hassle and no fuss - I set it up entirely online in 10 minutes. If these qualifications meet your criteria, buy this sucker - you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bad IMEI", "Author": "Devin Smith", "ReviewID": "R3AS74GE2F5406", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was excited to purchase the Galaxy S4, however this buyer has misled me by selling me a phone with an apparently bad IMEI which is continuously reported as stolen after a service update by my provider.

I had purchased online, so it was international i9500. Battery bulged and had standard issue that is widely reported in the press. I called Samsung USA. They refuse to change the battery and say that it is international. The phone is British EU based. I checked with IMEI number also. Samsung US claims the phone is from Syria! and refuse to replace the battery. Well that's it for customer Service. So warning that the international phones have no warranty!UPDATE: 10/8/2013:An updated NFC Tag from Whiztags is just awesome, has 450 bytes of memory and I use several of those in office and home with my Samsung Galaxy S4 NFC tags - Topaz 512 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writeable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 3 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee!I have been using TechMatteTM Qi-compatible Wireless Charger for the Nexus 4, HTC 8X, HTC Droid DNA, Nokia Lumia 920, LG Optimus Vu2 (With AC Adapter and Micro USB Cable). and TechMatteTM Qi-standard Wireless Charger Receiver Coil for SAMSUNG Galaxy S4 SIV for wireless charging and they are very convenient for charging by placing on the mat.UPDATE 9/15/2013:I thought I will update since it's been a while. We have two Galaxy S4 in the family. One black and one white both unlocked. There has been few firmware updates to the 9500 International series. I have been asked about the heat issue. Other than normal electronic heating feeling, it does NOT get super hot etc. In the initial days some people had issues, but apparently firmware has patched it. Version 4.2.2, BUILD: JDQ39.I9500XXUAMDX. Kernel 3.4.5-526212. I use Battery Widget Pro and has been watching battery usage. Easily for a day with normal usage. If I use video streaming and use NAVIGON indiscriminately, of course battery usage will shot down. Camera app does crash with latest updates. If I don't use camera for a day and use it, sometimes it crashes and phone reboots. After that no issue in subsequent sessions.  I have been using NFC a lot. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with  NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.Get a spare battery if you are using phone in an intense manner or if you are on long road trips or for just peace of mind. Timetec 2*2600mAh High Capacity Li-ion Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 S IV SIV, I9500. Samsung Galaxy GT-I9500, Verizon SCH-I545, AT&T; SGH-I337, Sprint SPH-L720+Free Bonus TimeTecTM Multi-purpose USB Travel Charger is a great choice.Another great gadget to have in your backpack while traveling or at home is an excellen remote for this phone. Yes a remote for media and camera. I have reviewed it at Satechi BT MediaRemote Bluetooth Multi-Media Remote Control (White) for Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, S4 / Note, Note II / Galaxy Tab / Galaxy NexusORIGINAL REVIEWGalaxy S4 is an incredible phone. I have been using this unlocked S4 for past 2 days helping a friend to migrate from iPhone 4S. My friend has been on iPhone and it also gave me a unique perspective. I used iPhone for couple of years and been using Android for past 3+ years.I have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvTriggerGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4.

It has neither crashed, nor shown any lag. The screen and back of the phone can get a bit hot to touch. I find this happens with most Android phones I have owned (i.e. Captivate, Skyrocket, S4), especially if you have the back light raised to maximum output for longer than several minutes.A word of caution: if you are a developer or like to root your devices, you should be aware that you need the MDB/MDL firmware versions of the phone in order to install a recovery.  If you have MF3, firmware, you will not be able to install recovery and it will be trick to root the device. I believe \"safe strap\" is the answer but I do not know the details. Look into this issue before purchasing.  Further, if you do purchase a device and it is rootable, your carrier will likely try to push an over the air update to your firmware changing it to MF3 or beyond. If you want to root and install a recovery, you will have to stop this process. I advise you also look into this.Update Nov 2013: I believe there is a way to root and install a recovery on S4s with MF3 or later firmware.

I had an I-phone 4 and I didn't want to change it at all because I was so used to it but once I got this phone I saw a big difference between phones. The Samsung S4 is waaaaaaaaay better than the I-phone, it has a bigger screen, better graphics and you don't have to jailbreak it to get all the good stuff.

Reviews by anyone who don't rate the screen at least good have no credibility.Pros: Awesome screen. Didn't reaize how bad my old phone's screen was until I used this one.  Ringer and notification sounds are loud enough... you won't have to search for extra loud ringers.  Thin, light  Great features  Decent battery life, even using extra bright screen settings  Fast and smooth. Apps run fast, scrolling and page turning are lag free.  The voice control is nifty and actually very useful.  GPS works just great, is fast enough and has enough features to be useful (unlike my old smart phone)Cons: Can't use it as an external USB drive without installing klunky Samsung software on your PC.  Micro SD card is hard to access, you have to remove the entire back of the phone to get at it. What was Samsung thinking?  No built-in FM tuner hardware. That was almost a deal killer for me, but few others use it.  The merry-go-round software is aggravating. It even interferes with screen unlocking if you aren't careful.Overall, very happy with the phone. My aggravations are probably not so important to most people, but needed to be said.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "MMS", "Author": "Sherhonda M.", "ReviewID": "R10CZPCTC988X5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "works fine but cant send any mms messages so I have to call and get it checked out I don't know if its a network error or phone error!!!", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Galaxy s4", "Author": "Daysi Leon", "ReviewID": "R3EHR5C4H1L844", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "loved this product ! workes great i just wish it came with instrustions because i am an iphone user and im new to android .", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's ok", "Author": "Lex", "ReviewID": "RXJROSA7FXDDK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Besides the fact that the case is made of plastic and when it vibrates it makes a weird sound, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "RTM4A09E0XJDV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am basing this review on the Samsung S4 only and not the seller who is a five star. The phone has been great on battery life to my surprise. I had assumed since it was bigger and better it would use more battery. My wife only charges hers about every third day, mine about every second day. It has great features that I didn't have with the S2. I wont go into all that it can do as you need to decide for your self what phone is best for you.  The features that are advertised for the S4 work great. I DO like the fact that you can create folders instead of having single icons. It also has a quick access side bar that I think is convenient. The only reason so far that keeps me from rating the PHONE five stars is the ability to connect to wifi. Do your homework and read the forums concerning the connecting to wifi. I would still get the same phone knowing what I know but we are not big users of the internet on our phones as we have tablets and laptops for that. I will post later how much data it uses compared to what I used to use with our S2's.
