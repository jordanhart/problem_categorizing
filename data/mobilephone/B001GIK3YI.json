A phone which performs the basic functions easily, that's your phone. If you look for something a little bit fancy you can take a pass at it. If you don't mind using a thick cell phone, it shouldn't bother you, that's a thick one. If you like slim phone forget it.I was looking for a cheap and solid phone to replace my Motorolla Razor, and this one made the trick well.

I bought my Nokia 6010 from Walmart in 2005 and signed up to the T-Mobile prepaid plan. I am retired and an empty-nester. I keep in touch mostly by email and FB. You couldn't ask for a simpler, easier to use, or more reliable basic cell phone than this. I replaced my original battery 2 years ago. You have to buy generic batteries now as factory batteries are no longer available. As far as I am concerned the generic battery is better, cheaper and holds its charge longer than the OEM battery. It is what it is. It is not an iPhone, or a flip phone or a texting phone or a camera phone. If you want a cheap, reliable cell phone you cannot beat this. My previous cell phone was a Moterola flip phone with Nextel. And, I have seen my brother's Samsung Android smart phone and I am just not interested in anything but a basic cell phone.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hard to hear, sometimes garbled", "Author": "Bobby Bamford", "ReviewID": "R32ZF9054KK0NH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone speaker is not clear.
