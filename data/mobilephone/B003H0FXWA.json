{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent basic phone!", "Author": "Cheri", "ReviewID": "R1QD1ASJ8U7F3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone as a downgrade from a smartphone to a basic phone. I had owned this phone in the past and it was just as I remembered it to be. Simple and easy to use, yet very elegant looking. I must admit that purple is my favorite color and the first thing that attracted me to this phone when I saw it in the Verizon store a few years ago. But the fact that it is a solid sturdy quality phone makes it an even better purchase. I had no problem what so ever activating this phone on my existing Verizon account.. I recommend this phone to anyone needing a nice quality basic phone.I have read reviews that say battery life is bad, but I have had no problem with that as of yet I am still on my first charge after two days and it reads almost a full charge still. Sound quality is great during calls, clear and crisp on my end and no complaint from the other end when I asked. I don't really use my phone as a camera so the camera feature is not as important to me.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good as kids emergency phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3RNZ1YTV1KOS8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I feel more secure having my grade level child carry a phone that is solely used when he needs to, either when his pickup rides didn't show up or other emergencies after school or on family/school field trips. This phone is one of the few left that is simple, works on current Verizon network, and also allow me to turn on location tracking when I need to. My son likes the purple color. The chrome accent/trim gives a real handsome look overall...in my opinion.Since it is 99% on standby in vibrate mode (didn't want to ring in classroom), the phone can last a week on a full battery charge. The re-charging of the battery when low, took less than one hour!", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "no instructions on using phone", "Author": "Gerry L.

Found out Verizon no longer supports any app software for this phone.........so no apps ever. Other than that the phone works fine but it looks like talking is all anyone will ever be able to use it for. Maybe seller didn't know about the software app issue. I ordered this phone because I have family members who also have this phone and I knew it would receive a signal where I live which can be a real problem. I will keep the phone for that reason but the selling price definitely way too high considering the app software issue.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "........stinks", "Author": "Vickie \"/J.Walker\"", "ReviewID": "R29WVHS32RSKHG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone was good, but a month later, when i shut it , it turns it off by itself and restarts, itself and all that, soooooo ezxcatly how new is this? im DEF! done buying phones from amazon cell phone sellers!.....", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for mom", "Author": "Lahiru", "ReviewID": "RSCYFKXJQVSMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone for somebody who is not technologically advanced but still appreciate a goodsolid phone.

I've had a lot of phones, and this one is my favorite! Sure, I can afford an Iphone or something similiar, but I prefer simpler times and things.
