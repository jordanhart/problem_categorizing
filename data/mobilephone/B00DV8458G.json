{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Best starter smartphone ever for KIDS for the price you", "Author": "Shrimant K. Patel", "ReviewID": "R2M31GYHFEGK4W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By now I have almost tested out all the features on this phone and I am satisfied enough to be writing this review. Having used the Iphones for over 7 years now my fingers were used to the iphone/ipad touches so initially I had problems but soon I learned that the touches needs to be a bit harder than the I-devices and problem solved. Another problem I faced was with the keyboard which is by default phone style and was having a hard time typing in anything, but soon I realized that inside settings->Language & Keyboard there is a LG Qwerty keyboard available and problem solved.One of the reviewer had given a 2 star because his phone auto dialed...and I did test that out too and did find out that , that was in fact a problem as with the slightest slide of the slider physical keyboard the tough screen comes alive...., but I found another quick fix to it...just enable the screen lock from Settings-Locations & Security and enable screen lock.Imagine a unlocked iphone at $600 plus and without extended warranty and replacement imagine your kid loosing it or jumping into the pool with the iphone in his pocket....???? $600 + gone right away...with this one all you loose is 50 bucks...Well this one solves all the purposes and beATS THE IPHONE PRICE BY MORE THAN 1/12 THE COST OF IPHONES and still has almost all the basic featured that the iphone has including Voice navigation to all popular apps, Wifi, Cellular data, 3mega pix camera. Oh yes with the iphone the price difference between a 16Gb Vs a 32GB is over or around $200...but in this one if you needed extra memory for your songs and videos you can upgrade to UHS(Ultra High Speed) 32 GM micro SD card for just around $20.No kidding...you need to try out the power of this one to believe it...I am a fan...of it... I am using this one on a H20wireless SIM and get decent 2G speeds on cellular.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Its a great phone for the price!", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "RZIK0K276XG98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its a great phone for the price.Many android apps work on it.

McGinnis", "ReviewID": "R3V5YWPXT7FJ9J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have just recently purchased this phone for use with Consumer Cellular, and it seems to work well enough, especially for the price.  I don't have any problems with the phone itself - yet, at least.  The problem that I have encountered is that there are no accessories specific to this phone.  No screen protectors that just fit, no rubberized covers to keep it from slipping out of my fingers (very smooth and slippery, like most phones).I called LG support to find that this phone was manufactured for sale in Canada.  If you are in the US like I am, they say that you will have no warranty, and no way to buy replacement parts.  That doesn't bother me so much, since the cost of the phone probably doesn't justify the hassle of sending it in for repairs.  It's just the availability of accessories that bugs me.UPDATE: It's been little over a week with this phone and I've encountered a problem: I cannot send or receive picture or video text messages.  Bummer.  I CAN send/receive emails with image attachments, though.  My daughters will just have to send me emails instead of text messages if they want me to see their photos. I put an SD card in the phone right after I got it, but that didn't help any.Another problem that might not be a problem with the phone as much as with the operating system (or perhaps with the entire cell phone industry) is that my phone doesn't use the SD card for most apps.  I keep getting notification that I'm running out of storage space, even though the card is practically empty.  And from the forums I've searched, it looks like you need to be a courageous geek to by-pass the operating system to get practical usage of the SD card.  I'm still researching this problem, and if I find a reasonable solution, I'll update my review again.  It's entirely possible that solving this problem will also solve the problem of no images with texting.My opinion has slipped from 4 stars to 3 because of these problems.UPDATE 2: I took the advice of several websites and \"rooted\" this phone, so that I could manage the applications.  However, none of the applications that came with the phone can be moved to the SD card, so I still get \"Phone storage space getting low\" notifications.  The internal storage of this phone is only 140MB which really limits your ability to add apps. I no longer recommend this phone. I'v dropped my rating to one star. You'd be better off with a good old flip phone.  Again, if I come up with a solution, I'll re-consider my rating.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Qwerty", "Author": "BASIL BERNARD SURUPA", "ReviewID": "R1JWI7MQEWFXUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I work in the shop floor and have to get into all sorts of postures- I wanted an android and also Qwerty for Whatsapp or e-mail on the go .

(I have an iPad and macbook at home with my calendar and set up a gmail account *for the phone calendar* and was able to link them all!)  You just need to enter every event as a \"gmail\" event, not an iPad event, or it won't show up on the phone's calendar.  This phone does the trick.  The price was reasonable and the android system is good, even though it is older.  I did have to set up the APN settings in order to get data with a help desk specialist at consumer cellular for  the data to work.  Also, it was doing a little \"butt dialing\" until I discovered how to stop it.  Not only do you have to set up a screen lock, BUT ALSO, you need to always hit the \"HOME\" button, then the red button before putting it in your pocket.  no more \"butt dialing\" or \"butt texting\" going on here.  You also need to buy a micro sd card to take pictures and download any games to increase the memory.  Now, we have 3 phones (home, mine and one of my kids) through consumer cellular for $80 per month.  We share 5000 texts, 2000 minutes and 500mb of data.  If my son wants to use a bunch of data at home on his phone, he just turns on the wifi (he bought an unlocked nokia lumia 900 and also had to set up the APN with the help desk at consumer cellular).  great way for me to have a cheap smart phone. If you want the latest and greatest, this is not it :) (the nokia is great though and much cheaper than an iPhone) but I personally do not need an excuse to look at my phone any more, I just need it to communicate and see my calendar!", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Magaly C", "ReviewID": "R3OJU6KEO8FQIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent budget cell phone. I've been using it for about a month and a half, and I have no issues so far. The keyboard it's pretty good and the phone it's fast if it's not loaded with too many apps. I haven't seen the messaging bug yet, although once the sms app crash when opening; but I erased some conversations and then everything has work out fine. Good signal, it recognized my chip immediately and I had no problems during a call.It's a really really good budget phone. I think it's pointless comparing it with other phones since it's just a $60 cell phone, not a $600 phone. You've got limited internal space, not so fast if you download many apps, it doesn't support big resolutions in youtube, battery doesn't last so long when wifi it's turn on. But if you keep it with not so many apps and have a battery app, it will work good for messaging, whatsapp, listening music, reading news, etc. And the camera it's so good.

You can get a better one for the same price from your cell phone provider and avoid a lot of headaches!  This is a cute phone and works fine for very basic functions like calls, text messaging and wi-fi access, but mine, at least, was unable to ever connect to 2G or 3G networks for data (despite tech help calls to T-mobile, LG, and Breed) - which is, after all, why I bought a smartphone in the first place.  The version of Android is also already so old that it's incompatible with the current versions of many apps - for example, Instagram and TuneIn Radio won't work with it.  I ended up having to return it.

With no front camera to sense when the camera is up to your face it has been coded so the phone app locks the screen as soon as a call is in progress.  If you are dialing into anything requiring key presses- like your voicemail- you will have to unlock the screen every few seconds.2.  There is no update available from LG, there is no rom mod available from cyanogen, there is nothing you can do to update the OS (without risking bricking it by installing a ROM built for another model)  I have tried several no-lock apps, and not one can over ride the coding for the screen lock.3.  Regardless of the screen lock and display timeout settings applied in Security or Display settings the phone screen locks right about 30 seconds of inactivity.  Again, there seems to be no way around that.4. The LG App Adviser wont connect over wifi- and there is no updated app available from LG or in the Play store.The screen is small.  I'm not saying that as a complaint, just be forewarned.Form factor is not bad, it is a little fat, as to be expected for a phone with a physical keyboard, but otherwise it is all around small.The slide out keyboard is actually quite good.It makes voice calls with about the same reception as any other phone, and it's not bad for text.
