Probably not. But this is the phone for people who are looking for a phone and a tablet put into one. Literally. I've had the honor of using this phone for about a week now and the large part of the reason I wanted to pick one up was that I wanted to see what the benefits of having such a large phone like this is. And this phone is Large. I mean, my primary phone is the Galaxy Note 3 so one would think that the Galaxy Mega wouldn't be such a jump from a 5.7 inch display the Note 3 has, but immediately I could tell the significant jump in screen real estate that I got from using this phone as opposed to the Note 3's Screen. The phone itself looks like a giant Galaxy S 4. I thought that the resolution would suffer from the larger screen size but surprisingly it is vibrant and nice looking. It's not a top of the line specs kind of phone like the Note 3 is so I could tell that the Galaxy Mega resolution was of lesser quality that the Note 3's but I would say it is better than than alot of other phones. It's worse than that of the iPhone 5, Note 3, but probably comparable to the S3. The benefits of having the phone is that watching videos is a pleasure. It's like i'm holding a mini TV in my hand. Furthermore, browsing web pages on the phone feels like i'm using my laptop. And, the battery life (3200 mAh) is the same as the Note 3's battery (they are not the same size). So, I get about the same usage time on the Galaxy Mega as I do on the Note 3 which is to say, I get alot out of the battery. A full charge will last me a day and even until the next day midway through. I use my phone frequently during the day to check the news, text, etc. But, Let me remind you that unless you are an NBA basketball player or have abnormally huge hands you will NOT be able to text with one hand. I'm 5'8 so imagine how big my hands are, but I could still type texts on the Note 3's keyboard with one hand if i position them correctly, but not with the Galaxy Mega. But, with that being said typing texts on this phone is awesome when one does have two hands available because the keys are so large that I rarely make mistakes typing sentences out. I sometimes have the need to type texts with one hand so that bugged me a bit because, even for just basic swipes across the screen sometimes I needed to use 2 hands. This took a bit of getting used to for me. So, this is definitely not a phone for people who need one hand free frequently when using their phone. The camera is decent, not great, as one would expect from a 8 mega pixel camera. Further, using the camera feels like holding up a tablet. But once I got used to the size pictures were easy to take and so were videos. And, the speaker and sound are pretty decent and loud so no complaints on that front. Surprisingly though, the Galaxy Mega as big as it is, fit in my pocket. I'm not going to say comfortably but it fit nonetheless. If you wear any type of tight fitting pants you will not be able to put this phone in your pocket. But I imagine it would do just fine in a purse or hand bag as it is light for its size. Some of the things that I didn't like about the phone were that every time I take this phone out people either, one, gather around me and ask me about it or two, crack a smart alec joke on me about it. (insert your favorite private part joke here). So, however you put it whether one likes it or not the phone will draw attention. Furthermore, Holding the phone up for a call is not as bad as I thought, it seems natural, nothing awkward but I imagine I look sort of off, holding a big slab of a phone up to my head. Another thing that I don't like about the Galaxy Mega is the build quality. It feels cheap because of all the plastic around it. But if you're used to a Galaxy S phone this shouldn't be too much a problem for you. So, with this experience under my belt I would only recommend this phone to people who can't read small texts, have really big hands, or want to get rid of their tablet and have a phone and a tablet all in one device. And even then I would recommend going to a store first and trying it out first before purchasing it online and realizing that it is too big of a device to handle. I personally will keep using my Note 3 as my primary device (because of the better specs) but, I am intrigued with the phone's ability to be my phone to text and take calls and be a pretty decent tablet too. I also like the ability to upgrade the phone's memory (16 GB internal and 64 GB can be added) and replace the batteries if needed by removing the back plastic. But I can go without all the attention it brings. It also takes a few days to really get used to the size of the device.  In the end, the reason I'll give it four stars is because it is not a phone for every one and it does lack in top of the line performance.  But, let me add that it is a great value for the price (500$) compared to, let's say the iPhone 5s or the Note 3 (750-800$), but of course you're not getting top of the line specs, but the difference is negligible, and only a phone geek will really care about that kind of stuff.  As for me, I'll keep it around and use it a bit more before I make anymore conclusions on it.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for what I got it for", "Author": "A. Green \"Boilrmakr\"", "ReviewID": "R35GVWX5KWEWPO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased my phone from an AT&T; store. The deal went pretty smoothly as the fellow said he was going to be the first person to sell one there. This was a couple of weeks after it was available.I wanted this phone for its large size. I make a lot of Skitch notes and mark them up in the field. The large screen gives me better control of items in the image in order to note equipment failures. I was using at 7\" Tab 2 before but wanted to consolidate my phone with my tablet. Why carry two devices? I also have a Next Issue account and can read magazines on it. Also, I use it as an ebook reader.Having the microSD card is great for storing movies while not on a network. My area has spotty, and that is being generous, coverage. If I want to watch a movie I may be able to use Netflix but maybe not. Having a few movies, songs, ebooks, or other media on the external sd card gives me access to entertainment. It was actaully the reason I bought this instead of waiting for the Nexus 5. I have not found a reliable way to move apps to the external SD card.As others have said, the screen is not as sharp as one of the higher end Samsungs. But it is good for watching netcasts and movies on the go. The sound is ok. The rear facing speaker works if you cup your hand over it to bounce the sound to the front. Otherwise I use external speakers.I am not a fan of the Samsung Touchwiz launcher. I put Nova Launcher on it as soon as I could. But launchers are a personal preference. After about 6 months I try to put Cyanogenmod on my phones. I haven't made it that far yet.The processor works fast enough for me. I do not do a lot of gaming but the two I tried worked well. I use this mostly as a work phablet, not a game pad.The latest update from AT&T; has hurt my wifi connection. It checks for \"Internet Connection Qualtiy\" and if it doesn't find it is fast enough apparently it disconnects you from the wifi. At work I have a wifi network which isn't very fast. I connect to equpment in my office and not the net. It drops my connection very often. Before the update my connection was strong.The phone is pretty slim. Without a case I could put it in a pocket very easily. Being in an industrial environment I have put it in an Otterbox Defender Case. It is a lot larger but I don't worry about dropping it while climbing ladders at work.All in all I am pretty satisfied with this unit.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "A 5 star win!!!", "Author": "Gail Potter", "ReviewID": "R21D2JIELZGCN4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exceeded all of my expectations!

Not too small for my very nearsightedness, not too big to fatigue my arm as quickly as my Galaxy 3 8 inch tablet does.Big Pros:1.  Micro SD card slot can handle up to a 64GB card!2.  The back shell is removable - that's where the battery,  SIM and MicroSD live.  Allows for very sleek body styling.3.  Large, user replaceable battery.  I'm old fashioned.  I like a battery that I can replace if it gets where it no longer keeps a charge all day.4.  Humongous 6.3 inch gorgeous screen.  Is it a tablet that makes phone calls ?  Is it a phone that is also a wifi tablet ?  Who cares ?  It suits my needs and my wifes needs.5.  Price from Amazon locked on ATT carrier - I have been eyeballing this phone and a few others for a while.  Was just given a new work phone, HTC One M7, it's pretty darned awesome, was considering that one also for our personal phones.  ATT website had refurbed Mega 6.3's for Zero bucks, but they went out of stock befor emy payday.  Started poking around the internet and found Amazon offering NEW 6.3's for a freaking penny!  I'm not leaving ATT, and our 2 year contracts had expired, so Hello New Phones !!!6.  Amazon's freaking 2 day shipping was included in the already sweet deal for FREE!  My wife and I are impatient.  Two days is Amazawesome!!!7.  It's SO SHINY!!!!!!!  Mmmm...Black and Chrome - reminds me of our black 2004 Mercury Marauder that we loved.8.  My wife LOVES her Mega 6.3.  This is a woman that already owns a desktop pc, a netbook, a 17 inch laptop (for Sims 3, of course), Nintendo DS, two Xbox360s, and a Galaxy Note 3 8.0 inch tablet.  She is NOT easily impressed.  Oh yeah, she still has her two year old Acer 7 inch tablet, too.  LOLCons:1.  It's a bit slippery, make sure to order some kind of case at the same time is you can, even if it's just a cheap rubbery one to get you by while you decide on what type you will user permanently.  I dropped the wife's Mega on the floor already (don't tell!).  It didn't scratch or damage any part.  This was a slide off some papers on the desk onto the hard faux wood composite floor.2.  I have to wait for this weekend to finish setting up and configuring our phones.  :(  But I got the numbers switched over to the Megas easily on the ATT web site.3.  It does not have Android KitKat yet, but is slated to later this year.4.  It took me a while to find and peel off all of the protective plastic on the shiny chrome  metallic looking edges.5.  Took two whole days for the new phones to get to my house.  STOP SLACKING, AMAZON !!!  When I spend TWO WHOLE CENTS on my debit card, I WANT IT NOW!!!  ( I do predict that Amazon will be the first corporate entity to perfect everyday use of teleportation.  After that comes mind-reading...Amazon will know what I want before I want it due to predictive algorithms and will have it standing on the transporter platform waiting for me to authorize the purchase with my card.  Really, Amazon, there is a mountain money to be made here.)6.  Seriously, I am having trouble finding serious cons here.  The above cons are intended for your amusement only.I know these are heavily discounted due to a newer model on the horizon, but that's what I do.  I generally buy a little behind the bleeding edge and save huge bucks while owning cool stuff.  I've got a feeling that I am going to have to up our data plan some more.  :-)", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect, a tablet and a phone.

Mega isn't premium phone in today's standards as it uses last year's specs. It's bigger but not better. STILL, that is perfectly fine by me. I wanted bigger display. I didn't need better specs. The phone isn't slow at all, but it just isn't as fast as the today's premium phones. Still upgrade in speed in real life is not very noticeable in my opinion. As for the display, now smaller 5\" display phones are sporting 1080P Full HD display, but Mega \"only\" has 720P HD display. Can't you tell the difference in real life? I doubt it. The display looks beautiful. Period. I have Nexus 2nd gen with 1080P display with bigger 7\" display. When I compare 720P and 1080P videos on Nexus, I don't notice the difference in extra resolution in a small 7\" display. So what benefit do we gain in getting higher resolution after 720P? Hmmmm... perhaps a satisfaction in \"knowing\" that I have higher resolution although I may not \"see\" the difference. You will see the 6.3\" vs 5.5\" difference very clearly though. Bottom line, if you don't mind carrying around a big phone, you will enjoy the mega. If 6.3\" mega is simply too big, don't get it. This is a love it or hated phone.

Awesome for playing games on, watching movies, listening to music  or just reading. Web pages have font that is clearly readable with this screen size without having to zoom in. E-Book apps are nearly the size of a real book on this baby, and it is a joy to use as a kindle type reader. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is torn between a tablet or phone.Pros:-Awesome Display size-Galaxy 4 gpu provides good performance-8.5 hour continuous video playback battery life-Nice sound from the speakers, loud enough not to need externals-16gb storage standard-Android App Store installed and easy to use-voice activation features work well-People stop to look as you make a phone call on your tablet :PCons:-The side mounted buttons are sometimes accidently pushed while trying to hold the phone-If you choose a wallet style case (which work great for most circumstances) it can be a tad cumbersome to use as a phone-No stylus, I don't care, but it is a difference between it and the Note.-A bit too large to fit in your pocket, unless you have giant pockets lol", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "I'm trying to compensate.", "Author": "O.
