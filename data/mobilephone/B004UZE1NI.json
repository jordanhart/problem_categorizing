I also like that you can open the phone for larger screen and it sits firmly for hands free talking using the speaker option. I had one several years ago until I updated to a smart phone model. I purchased this one for my mom, since I really enjoyed using this model before. Some nice features, and easy to use / understand. I purchased a refurbished one this time,and the first one arrived in 3 days in wonderful condition. I had a problem with the item working correctly and the vendor answered within a few hours (it was even a Sunday!) Wonderful response, they sent a replacement out the next day, and it arrived very quickly. The replacement phone has some wear on the corners (not important to me), and seems to be working just fine after several days. I'm very impressed by the fast response and resolution from this vendor and would definitely use them again.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect.", "Author": "Laura S.", "ReviewID": "R3FTICLG5QVW91", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was nervous about buying a cell phone, something I rely on and use everyday, on the Internet, but AppleWireless exceeded my standards with customer service and an amazing product.

I purchased the phone and the one I was sent was a piece of crap. Then I was offered to have a replacement. It is an ok phone. It definitely isn't what I was hoping for as a replacement of my old phone. Both phones had been damaged by water. The first phone I received was a waste of my time. The phone I was wanting to replace with it was in better shape. The second one works, but the battery is crappy and it doesn't always fully charge when I plug it in. The only good thing about this transaction was the shipping. It was fast and arrived before it said that it was going to.

My daughter was searching Amazon and for this phone and I was so happy to go back to the enV phone.  When I got the phone, it came without a battery.  Once the battery was sent, it would not charge, so they sent me another battery which also would not charge.  After trouble shooting everything, I found out the charger they sent was not for this phone so they sent out a new charger which again would not charge the phone.  I gave up and finally found an old charger I had that worked.

However, the seller neglected to say the phone is no longer manufactured, packaged it in a box for another phone, and sent it without directions. Because it was to be a gift it would have been nice to have had this info included in the description prior to my purchasing it. Had I known I simply would have passed over it. When I contacted them about it they were cold about it. Obviously their customers mean little to them. They did offer to give me a refund, but, it was too late. Christmas was here. I wouldn't have had a replacement in time to have it under the tree. Honesty up front would have prevented the whole thing. Oh and they provided a PDF online for the directions.

We didn't need all of the bells and whistles of a smart phone and the pricy data package that comes alone with them. It's hard to find a inexpensive phone out there that is going to meet my needs as to what I need for it to do for him as a mother and what he wants as a teenage boy. This phone was the perfect compromise. He likes, I like. Win win!On another note, I was sceptical about buying from a third party suplier. I wasn't sure how difficult it was going to be getting the phone set up with my phone carrier once I got it. But since buying a uses phone thru verizon was much more expensive and they didn't have a great selection of non-smartphone options to chose from I took a chance. I must say getting the phone activated took one phone call and a few prompts on an automated system. As long as you know your password it is a breeze!!
