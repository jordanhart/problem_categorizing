{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible smartphone, best Android device ever", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R14Y3NMFMA4VFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simply put, this is the best Android device ever.Pros:1. Incredibly sexy: thin but not too thin, slightly contoured, more rigid than other Samsung Android devices thanks to the internal metal frame2. Large, bright, detailed screen.  However it doesn't come off as huge due to minimal bezel and the use of the bottom portion of the screen for contextual soft-keys.  The screen uses a pentile-matrix configuration, but the pixel density is so good that you really can't notice unless you look very closely and even then it's difficult to tell.  The blacks melt into to the bezel beautifully and the colors pop.3. You get the very latest version of Android, with instant updates from Google.  I have grown to despise carrier/OEM UI skins and their accompanying OS update delays.  The Android 4.0 UI is a huge upgrade and behaves much much better, making such carrier/OEM skins even less desirable.  The interface seems to have been reworked from the ground up for smooth, responsive operation.  Transitions are slick, and apps run great.  I haven't had app compatibility issues some others have mentioned; some games haven't been updated for 4.0 yet but most apps I use work fine.  The whole experience is leaps and bounds over any prior version of Android.  4.0 seems made for this phone and works perfectly.4. If you get the unlocked GSM version, it works on any GSM network in the world with up to 21mbps HSPA+ speeds.  I bought it overseas and popped in a $30/mo T-Mobile SIM and it works perfectly, I get speeds between 3-8mbps in the SF Bay Area, with seamless transitions between EDGE, HSPA/HSPA+.  Not to mention no carrier bloatware!5. Everything in the OS works great: Wifi hotspot, bluetooth tethering, bluetooth HID (I tried Apple wireless keyboard and trackpad), battery and bandwidth monitoring, music controls on earphones, built-in equalizer, HDMI out over MHL.  I am amazed at the relative lack of bugs in the OS given how new it is.6. The device is relatively easy to take apart (according to iFixit.com) and OEM parts are popping up on ebay, so if you break something or something stops working, you can fix it relatively easily and cheaply (except the screen, don't break that! You would have to replace the whole screen/digitizer/housing assembly)7. Thanks to having a single worldwide GSM model, there are plenty of compatible accessories available already8. Touch sensitivity on the screen is great.  The UI 'sticks' to your finger much closer than other Android devices I've used, though still not *quite* as close as iPhone -- however the iPhone people who have used my phone don't seem to notice.  In fact, this is the first Android device I've had where iPhone people don't immediately fault-find when they use it, and seem kind of thoughtful and chagrined instead9. Battery life seems pretty good for an Android device.  Not as good as an iPhone, but I can easily make it through a whole day of moderate-to-heavy use.  The removable battery means you can improve the battery life with an extended battery and can replace it when it starts to give out.  The OEM extended battery provides a modest boost in battery life and fits the phone's shape very nicely -- I highly recommend this upgrade unless you really like the phone's recessed backCons:1. Lack of an SD card slot and only 16GB of internal memory.  This is the only thing that bothers me.  However USB OTG solves part of this problem (with a special cable, you can plug in an external mass storage device -- this does not currently work without rooting, but official support will be included in a future firmware update as confirmed by Google)2. Screen is scratchable... it's not Gorilla Glass but the point is, even Gorilla Glass scratches given contact with the right material.  Order a good screen protector when you order the phone and don't take off the retail packaging screen film until you are ready to put on the screen protector.  This will keep your display perfect for years.3. Screen doesn't seem *quite* as bright as the SGS2 screen, but it's still brighter than any LCD I've used.4. You still can't buy the GSM version with a Samsung USA warranty... but if you buy it from a reputable international retailer they will broker your international warranty claims, or you can get it with a 3rd-party USA warranty from such as Newegg.  Maybe one day you will be able to get the GSM version with a Samsung USA warranty, but I'm starting to lose hope.  I even tried contacting Samsung USA support but they won't touch the i9250 for repairs, even if you're willing to pay5. Most of the software issues I previously noted have been fixed with updates from Google.  Camera quality has definitely improved, but still falls short of some Android phones and definitely the iPhone.  Hopefully this will continue to improve with further updates6. Buying the unlocked GSM version is still moderately expensive, and will always be more expensive than buying it subsidized on contract.  However no USA carrier has announced they will be carrying the GSM version so maybe it will never happen.  I had a hard time parting with the money until I received the device... but after owning it for a day, any regrets were completely gone.  I would pay that money again in a heartbeatHere are some additional cons if you decide to get the VZW version:1. Locked down to the VZW USA network on an expensive monthly plan (about $80/mo minimum, and a $350 ETF) with data caps (2-4GB/mo)2. LTE drains battery life (this has improved considerably with software updates, but still drains battery quicker when the LTE radio is on)3. VZW bloatware installed but can be disabled, they charge an extra $20/mo for wifi hotspot, firmware version disparity with GSM model4. A little bit fatter and heavier, making it less compatible with accessories for the international GSM version5. IMHO: you're not really getting the pure experience in terms of the OS, it's sullied by VZW's strong-arm business decisionsSome pros for the VZW version:1. You can pay around 100+tax for the device with new/reup contract2. VZW LTE is crazy fast (but you will hit the data cap that much quicker)3. USA warranty and carrier support4. 32GB internal memoryBottom line: if you like Android, you will love this phone and won't be able to go back to anything else unless you need/want some hardware support outside of these specs (eg. you really prefer a smaller phone, or you really need an SD slot)", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Device, although Price is High", "Author": "Stephen M Knipe II", "ReviewID": "R9VAA59H0ASWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Galaxy Nexus is an awesome device with a stunning display. Despite many other reviews online, ICS (the new version of Android launching with this device) is pretty easy to navigate/figure out. It does have a learning curve (even for die-hard long-time Android users), but much of the OS has been made more intuitive- one just has to step back and quit over-thinking what you are trying to do (or remembering previously complicated menus for those of us that have been around Android for a while), as (generally) everything you need is right there on the screen (unless you can't do it).  My only two complaints are:  1.)  Many apps still have not been updated to play nicely with ICS by  their developers (but this will change when Verizon launches the  device and ICS becomes more prevalent), and  2.)  The price. This phone is expensive, and while completely worth it for  power-users such as myself, many people will struggle with this. The  main reason for expense right now is the fact that it must be imported  to the US from the UK (and soon Japan/Germany/elsewhere?), so there  are fees and shipping associated with that. Also, once the device does  officially launch here in the US, Verizon (and other carriers  hopefully) will subsidize it and bring the price down a  bit).  Some people complain about the camera on this phone, but as with any other camera phone, there is a lot of variation. Yes there are bad pics out there on the various forums, but there are a lot of really good pictures taken with it by people who know the ins and outs of photography. The shutter and operation of the camera is lagless (perfect and fast), and I have found it to perform better than any of my other phones in low-light situations. It performs (in my experience) on par with the iPhone 4 (I have not played with a 4s yet so I can't say anything about that device). At the end of the day, if you want professional pictures, buy a professional camera. No phone will give you the quality of a DSLR. This phone is much more than sufficient for capturing the quick memories relevant for sharing via email/text messages or social media.  Also, there is a bug where the firmware does not debounce the volume rocker properly (there is an unshielded radio amplifier located near the rocker's circuitry that when connected to or near 2G signal on the 900 mHz band the volume rocker will think it is being pressed due to the interference), a software OTA update began being pushed out to phones yesterday (11/30/2011) to fix this issue (verified by many user reports to have fixed it). This issue affected only users outside of the US (we do not use the 900 mHz frequency band here in the states). If nothing else, this illustrates the greatest reason to buy this phone. The issue was discovered as widespread Sat. 11/19, Google's firmware fix is dated (as being compiled on/completed on) 11/21 (the following Monday), and the 9 days in between fix completion and deployment is due to testing and logistics of pushing out an OTA update. 11 days from issue identification to resolution, which is outstanding. The main reason to buy this phone is Google's dedication to this product line (the \"Nexus\" Series) and its software. No waiting on carriers and OEMs to write/modify/reject/etc. each little update the phone gets.I hope this helps someone realize this truly great device.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "If you like vanilla Android OS this is the one.", "Author": "D. Harry", "ReviewID": "R3D21VN8ERS1H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my Galaxy Nexus (GNex) for about a week and this is what I have observed.PROS:1. Super slim profile.2. Vanilla ICS. No Motoblur, Sense or Touchwiz on this. Just stock Android which helps with speed. I think this is the only phone available with the stock experience.3. Runs on T-Mobile HSPA+ and AT&T; HSPA. The fastest speeds I have gotten were with T-Mobile, 5MBup/5MB down.4. 720p screen. Super amoled. People make a big fuss about it being a Pentile matrix screen. It isn't a big deal, I can't tell even when I press my nose up to the screen, and you shouldn't worry about it either.5. Build quality is excellent. Again people compare it to the iPhone and it's metal and glass construction. But for that you pay with it being easily broken. The Gnex has a internal metal frame which makes it rugged. Also although the screen isn't Gorilla Glass, it still is fortified glass, which is the same thing as Gorilla Glass, but without the Corning branding.6. Decent battery life. On stand by I have no problem getting through 36 hours, also there are extended batteries available right here on Amazon that will extend your battery life even longer. Unfortunately most of them don't come with NFC.7. NFC! It stands for Near Field Communication. It is a small wireless chip in the battery which allows you with your phone and the app Google Wallet to pay for purchases with your phone. I use the Google Prepaid card, load it up with money then wherever you have a place that supports wireless payments(tap) you just select credit, hold the phone over the terminal till it beeps, inter your pin and hold it back over and bam you've paid!  LOL it's still sort of a gimmick but I think it's better than Siri.Cons:1. Lack of an SD card slot. This might be a dealbreaker for someone who listens to a lot of music but I have found a compromise. You go to Google play store, and upload your music to the cloud. The service is free, I believe you can upload 20,000 songs for free and stream it unlimited to your phone.2. No US warranty. If you are buying this to use overseas you might get a warranty overseas, but when I bought my phone and called up Samsung and gave them the IMEI they said it wasn't in their system. I would advise US customers to buy the phone directly from Google because you get a 12 month warranty. I hear if you buy the phone with American Express you get a 1 year warranty as a benefit of the card.3.Software. The 2 builds that you should have on your phone are \"Yakju\" or \"Takju\". If your phone does not, there is a chance that you will not be able to update your phone over the air from Google. You will be at the mercy of Samsung for your Android software updates, which they have a terrible record of. There is a free app in the Play store called GN Official Update Checker that will tell you what build you have. If you are experienced with flashing bootloaders this can be changed to one of the 2 Google builds easily. If you don't want to deal with this please buy your phone from Google directly.I ended up returning this phone and bought it directly from Google. Your miles may vary.Essential Software: This is a list of software every Galaxy Nexus owner should have installed.I am only listing free software.1. Lightflow: The Gnex has a multicolored LED at the bottom of the phone near the virtual buttons that flashes and turns different colors depending on the phones status. Lightflow allows you to customize this. One thing about the LED is that it blinks slowly, so unless you are staring at it for a few seconds you might miss the blink. Lightflow can help you speed it up.2. Juice Defender Free: All GSM phone owners should have Juice Defender. it turns off the mobile data radio when your screen is off, saving valuable power. I have easily doubled my battery life. Unless you \"need\" to have your phones mobile connection on all the time to get email and Facebook status updates, use this. So when your screen is off you won't get any emails/alerts. You will get texts. When you power up the screen all of the will come at once. I don't think this works with Sprint/Verizon Galaxy Nexuses3. Volume+ (note do not get the free version on the market) The Gnex speaker can be too quite for some people, luckily there is Volume+ to boost it. Go to the Play store, find Volume+ and note the person who wrote it, then Google for his name. He has a web forum where he lets people download the paid version of his app for free once you register. The free version has a maximum volume boost of 4+, the paid version on his site goes up to 15+ I think.4. Waze. Google Maps is excellent but not really made for the serious driver. I have been using Waze almost exclusively for the last few months on my previous phone as a well as my Gnex. It is a free app but differences its self from GMaps is that it is community run and connected. You can either stay anonymous or create a profile. It will give you real time status updates of every driver in your area who has Waze on their phone and the traffic conditions that they are in. It also notifies you of speed cameras and radar traps.5. SMS Popup. Does exactly what it says.Update 3 weeks in: This is the best phone I have owned. It is super quick, everything works. I feel like it is a mini computer and I don't have to worry about stuff running out of memory or lagging. Just get this phone. The HTC One X and S are faster in benchmarks, but that doesn't make a phone better. Having stock android, decent hardware and direct Google support instead of dealing with the manufacturer for updates makes this the deal.7/3/12STILL the best phone I have ever owned. I installed Jellybean 4.1 on it and it is flowing! The phone is so good Apple went to a judge to ban it from being sold. Haters gonna hate.7/30/13 UpdateStill rocking this phone, rooted and running paranoid Android 3.68 with Android 4.2.2 off XDA forums.I guess the only downside to this phone is the limited internal storage, 16GB isn't enough. Also the camera sucks, but I didn't buy the phone for the camera. it's nice to have but I don't really care too much, all my photos go up on Facebook. I bought an extended 3700mAh battery and I can easily get though 2 days of heavy usage. Not sure what's going on with my original battery back, it doesn't fit properly anymore. The battery is fine though.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Price of the phone Average", "Author": "Streak", "ReviewID": "R7C5BRWLEFD5Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everyone needs to realize the price of this phone is average for a brand new phone that's unsubsidized.  I paid this much for my Nexus One when it came out.  You have an option here, either you can buy it from Verizon for $199.99 with a 2 year contract and only be able to use it on verizon (Not bad if you're already with verizon) however if you want to use this phone with AT&T; or T-Mobile then you will have to buy the GSM unlocked version which is unsubsidized.  The benefit of this is you can use it on any carrier that has the correct bandwidths (Pretty much an GSM carrier) in any country.  So if you're with AT&T; now, you can buy the phone, have full data service but later if your decide to go to T-Mobile you can take your phone with you, exchange sim cards and ta-da...your phone works again, with full 4G data service on T-Mobile as well.So, there's a plus side and down side to both.  You can make the choice, but don't rate the phone poorly because you don't think it's a good deal because you can get it cheaper by being put under contract.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Generally pleased", "Author": "Giovanni Glass", "ReviewID": "RY8DOJFK7FFZN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "----3/22/12 Update----I have the 4.0.2 update. OTG USB works with any USB keyboard, USB mouse or Bluetooth keyboard or mouse. Supposedly there is an Ice Cream Sandwhich 4.0.5 update for the Verizon Galaxy Nexus that will trickle down to the GSM version. I hope USB memory stick support will come with that update.I can only seem to get 720p output from the USB MHL adapter. Some others have been able to get 1080p output. Note it's a *shared* screen, not a special screen for videos. What you see on the phone is what you get on the screen.I get occasional random reboots like once a week, but it rarely happens.Battery life is OK. I have a lot of apps installed like Facebook, Twitter and Skype that poll and gather data. The phone will last all day in standby. While surfing or using apps, I can get 2-3hours with the screen continuously on. On balance, I have to leave the phone plugged in at night to stay charged for the next day. The extended battery is available overseas and on eBay.Regarding Google Wallet, I side-loaded it using an APK from XDM. I was able to pay for some stuff at DuaneReade and 7-Eleven. It also supposedly works at RadioShack, CVS and RiteAide. None of them work with their rewards cards although you'd think it would. It works at the NJ Transit ticket kiosk at Penn Station. Google Wallet has been locked down tight recently and rooted users will have problems using the app. You are basically loading up a pre-paid credit card. When the balance is low, you have to fill it up more cash. It's hard to get to $0 balance. I think it's a neat feature, but I don't find myself using it all that much. Google *really* needs to open this app up to all NFC enabled phones, not just Sprint and AT&T; Galaxy Nexus phones. I think there is an issue where the carriers want a cut of the transaction since it goes over their network. As it stands, NFC payments is a non-starter technology with very little market penetration. ISIS, the other competing technology, will release later this year and will probably become available on more phones with more carrier buy-in.I still haven't used NFC tags. I haven't seen them anywhere in NYC yet.T-Mobile GSM is decent in NYC. At times it can get really slow (2-3Mbps) with 180ms+ ping. That's not good for real-time gaming or VOIP. They also throttle you even though you have yet to hit your cap. Their web proxy will compress JPG images. You'll notice websites will look more block and pixellated. If you switch to a https/SSL browser connection, your JPGs will look normal.The OLED screen uses a pentile sub-pixel layout. To my eye, it kind of looks like film grain. You notice it on solid dark colors on the screen. You won't notice it on photographs which look vibrant and bright on OLED. Detail is good, but not as good as high as an iPhone 4s. There is definitely more resolution (1280x720, some of the pixels on the right side are used for the on-screen navigation buttons). 1080p H.264 videos up that I downloaded from Youtube up to 5Mbps streams play well on the phone.----------------------I have the GSM version of the Galaxy Nexus. I can't add anything new to what's already been said at length in other reviews. But I can add some observations.The bad:- OTG USB cable doesn't work with the current ROM 4.0.1 of Ice Cream Sandwich on the phone. Plugging a keyboard or mouse with the cable doesn't work. Bluetooth devices work however.- Even with a 4.0.2 ROM, plugging a USB memory stick won't mount. You have to hack around it with 3rd party apps to mount FAT32 partitions.- There is an issue where in landscape mode, the lower right side of the screen doesn't respond to touch input while in a game.Supposedly these issues will be fixed in a future update like 4.0.2. So far, I haven't gotten the over-the-air update.- Using Google Wallet and NFC is useless until Google officially releases Google Wallet in the US. I haven't tested the NFC share feature yet.- The GSM version only comes in a 16GB model. A 32GB model is supposedly available overseas for pre-order.- At the moment, you can't buy an official OEM battery that has the NFC antenna built in. You can find knock-off batteries sans NFC antenna for the phone from eBay.The good:- The phone accepts a T-Mobile SIM card and an AT&T; SIM card in the US. I have a T-Mobile pre-paid SIM card and have a $30 Monthly4G 5GB plan. It works great. I'm getting 5 to 7 megabits down and 1 to 1.5 megabits up on HSPA+ in NYC.Overall I am pleased with the phone and will hold onto it for the next few years.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid phone that needs a bigger battery", "Author": "Dave A.", "ReviewID": "RBOD6O0T2M3LT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've used an unlocked HSPA+ Galaxy Nexus for a month. Overall, it's a very good phone. Having switched from a Blackberry (RIP!) this is my first Android phone so I can't compare it to other Android phones. It is thin, light and feels comfortable in my hand. However, it is a large phone and probably feels comfortable in my hand because I wear men's XL gloves.The screen is fine but not outstanding except maybe in ideal light. I've seen other phones with sharper screens including iPhones. I believe this phone uses a Pen Tile display and that type of display has been criticized for a lack of sharpness.The phone is fast and lags are not a problem. Some of that may be due to Jelly Bean, see below. HSPA+ seems to deliver data quickly. I understand that LTE is faster but this phone is plenty fast enough for me.Sound quality with calls is good. Pairing with my Blue Ant was no problem.The camera is relatively good but I've seen better pictures from other phones.The major drawback with this phone is it's battery life. It can make it morning to night only with very light usage. To preserve battery life I find myself turning off wifi, bluetooth and GPS if I am not using them. Fortunately, the operating system provides an easy widget to do this but it's still a pain and even then I have days where I have to recharge. The GPS in particular seems to consume power. To compensate I have USB charging cables in my car and briefcase and at my desk. I understand that LTE tends to use more power than HSPA+ and if that's true I would avoid this phone unless they have compensated somehow. This is a pretty good phone but it's of little use dead. I'd much prefer a somewhat thicker and heavier phone that relieves me of power management.One of the biggest benefits of buying an unlocked phone is that right after I started it up I received the upgrade from Android 4.0 (ICS I think) to 4.1 (Jelly Bean). The geek news regularly reports that users with locked Android phones must wait or do without Android upgrades. Bypassing carrier controls for operating system upgrades is a luxury usually reserved for iPhone users. Jelly Bean is supposed to be smoother and faster and that may be why this phone doesn't lag. If so, then unlocked is definitely the way to go.Another obvious benefit to buying an unlocked phone is the lack of a contract. I paid 349 for the phone which is a very low price for a phone barely off the cutting edge. I'll make up the premium I paid over a comparable phone had I bought it on contract in less than a year and then I'll be free to move to another device if I want.This phone would be a 5 if it had better battery life and a better screen.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Android 4 rocks!", "Author": "Leandro Cassa", "ReviewID": "RUNMBV3B3KH0D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let ms try to briefly explain my 3 months of Galaxy Nexus.The phone is fast, responds very well to touch (indeed the best I've experienced on an Android device). The loud speakers are poor and sometimes I fell the ear speaker could be louder.The mic does not have noise reduction, I used to have a Motorola Droid and I could speak at the subway that the person on the otherside would hear me as if I was locked in my room.The phone is very light and although is big, it is not uncomfortable holding or putting into you pocket. Probably because its quite slima as well.The screen is big, bright, beautiful and somehow avoids a lot of finger print. The phone might get a bit warm if you abuse 3G (really abuse!Im not talking about syncing your services or using social networks).Both cameras do a great job and are very very fast without losing quality or resolution (again, the fastest phone camera I've ever seem).Baterry holds with no problems a whole day of pure abuse, this means I wake up and start hearing local music using my bluetooth headset, when I get to work I turn on wifi and keep on using my bluetooth headset, but now listening online music. Im usually playing around on g+, feeds and browser. So you can count that as well. If I do not abuse as I do usually it can hold on for 2 or 3 days with sync on.Last but sure not least, Androi 4 (or ICS), this just made ALL the difference. It is beautiful, smart, stable and has a good usability. I wont get in details on that, check out android site or youTube to see what is new.Bottom line, great device I strongly recommend!", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Nexus gt-i9250", "Author": "thos25", "ReviewID": "R3OQCB765Y2XNU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this phone for about two weeks. I am very happy with it so far. It is a developers phone, so getting in and unlocking bootloader, rooting, and installing custom ROMS, etc is very easy to do. (Not that most phones arent).One of the main things people should be aware of is the different builds that are out there. There is a build known as yakju. This is directly updated by Google. You will get the most frequent and timeliest OTA updates with a yakju build. There are other variants out there as well. Yakjuxe, jakjuse, and a few others. These are not as desirable, as they are updated by either Samsung a carrier. You may wait longer to get android updates with these builds.If you wonder which version you have, install GN official update app, and the app will tell you which build you have. If you have yajku, great. If Not, search the net on how to unlock bootloader and flash yakju image onto it. It is a simple process, then you will be 100% pure Google. Of course, I am not responsible if you brick your phone...! And of course, this is only if you care to do so. Keeping a non yakju build will not harm you in any way. You will still get updates, just not quite as timely.Second, be aware that many retailers are selling DoCoMo branded Galaxy Nexus devices as a gt-i9250. These are in fact, SC-04D devices. Essentially the same, but often times have a sim lock issue associated with them. They will sometimes lose the unlocked sim and revert to a locked state. There is an app available to unlock it again, but it will lose the unique IMEI, and thereby could cause issues. I would personally stay away from an SC-04d.Now, to the phone. I love the camera. Coming from an HTC Evo 3D, the camera is very quick to capture the image. In low light situations the flash will slow down how quickly you can take pictures, but not too badly. If no flash is required the camera will take multiple photos quickly. Maybe 1-2 pics per second. Very quick compared to my previous phone. Also, I find that the image quality is superb for a 5mp.Software is terrific. ICS 4.0 is a huge leap from even where gingerbread left off. I like the ability to make folders especially. It helps me de-clutter my screens, which is always nice.The screen is very nice. Even though it is a pentile display, it is very nice to look at. Very clear. Again, coming from a QHD resolution on my Evo 3d, I am impressed.The phone also has a terrific form factor. I love the curved glass. The phone is very thin as well. I also like the overall form being slightly thicker on the bottom than at the top.The only thing that is potentially a negative is that Google and Facebook are in a bit of a spate with each other. I have found that the facebook integration on this phone is not as nice as on some others. Facebook is not allowed to sync contact info to your phone. So, if you are used to seeing peoples facebook photos on their contact info, you wont see it on this phone (at least for now). You can manually do it via the facebook app, but going through and assigning a pic to each person individually is tedious.Also, I recommend \"myalbum\" facebook photo uploader. Coming from my Evo 3d I was used to \"FB for HTC sense\". It allowed me to upload multiple photos at the same time, which was very nice. The stock FB app will not allow multiple uploads at the same time. MyAlbum is the app that will assist you in doing so.Overall, excellent phone. Amazing screen. Pure \"Vanilla\" Android.

The interface is awesome.  If you''re coming from Froyo or Gingerbread expect a learning curve from what you're used to.  Newcomers, welcome to Android 4.0.I imported mine, but it is the international unlocked gsm version.  To those who care, the cellular radio is average on this phone and par for Samsung.  Perhaps radio flashes might help.  If you're coming from a Nokia or Motorola phone expect a step down in reception.  Earpiece and loudspeaker are kinda low volume but good quality.  Perhaps an app like volume+ might help.  For those who care, it comes with a Texas Instruments sound chip.  Expect sound comparable to a Wolfson found in phones like Samsung Galaxy S or Motorola Atrix.  (extra tidbit, Texas Instruments bought Burr Brown a few years ago, wink) If you don't know, that means exceptional sound quality for a phone.  Bluetooth works great.  No issues so far.  Wifi speeds are great.  Mhl works great and looks great on a big screen.  As of now, using mhl you can only use landscape mode.  Notification led is limited to white with the stock rom.  There's a few bugs here and there but as par for a nexus phone, they will be fixed by google or if you're into flashing roms, fixed even faster by the development community.If you read my review you might've noticed I mentioned a lot of it's minor flaws.  In reality, this is Google's Developer Phone and will have/has a large development community.  A lot of the flaws/glitches/bugs will be fixed or improved upon.  Or if you prefer, replaced.  And that is part of the beauty of Android.  I was very hesitant to pay the over $700 USD to have this phone imported.

Bought it from Global Mobiles and it came in 2 days.  Popped my T-Mobile sim right out of my Nexus One and into this phone and it was off and running (gotta love GSM).  Was worried that it wouldn't be a \"yakju\" device like others have reported and I would have to re-image it to get the proper Google updates.  Checked it and it was a \"yakju\" device out of the box.  It asked me to update the phone minutes after I turned it on for the first time to 4.0.2 which was great.  Haven't had any of the issues that others have reported.  It did crash and reboot once while I was in the middle of using an app but this was a little while after I had went into the developer setting and set the phone to force hardware 2D rendering.  I promptly went back and turned this setting off and it hasn't crashed since.  Better to wait for developers to enable this in their apps.  The phone feels really fast especially compared to my Nexus One (as expected for a dual-core device).  The phone has pretty good reception, I get HSPA+ in most places averaging 3 to 4 bars.  I'm still getting used to some of the changes in Android and the size of the phone as well.  Even though its made of plastic,  the phone feels well put together (other then the battery cover, see below), its no iPhone, but I feel it holds its own.  The screen is amazing on phone.  The camera is so so, if you want to take nice pictures then buy a real camera.My big gripes with the phone are:- The battery cover is a bit of a pain to put back on.  I was a little nervous I was going to break it putting it back on.- 16gb only with no mico-sd card slot.  I was holding out for the 32gb model which would have taken care of this but after it was confirmed there would be no 32gb GSM model I went and bought this phone.- The phone felt a little slick in my hands and I felt like I was going to drop it.  I bought an Otterbox Commuter case and I can't recommend it enough.  Best phone case I've seen so far.  Otterbox SAM4-I515X-20-E4OTR Commuter Series Hybrid Case for Samsung Galaxy Nexus - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black-Charging adapter is kinda cheap looking and the way the U.S. plug inserts into it feels really loose.-Some apps aren't fully ICS ready yet.  Example: the Twitter app will not sync with my contacts.  Not a deal breaker and will subside with time.If you want a pure Android phone and you don't want to go to Verizon (or eventually Sprint) this is your best bet.  Like I said above I ordered it from Global Mobiles which qualifies for Amazon Prime and I ended up with a \"yakju\" phone so keep this in mind when you buy.  They also include instructions for setting up the APN's if you're an AT&T; customer which was nice (I didn't have to set anything up for T-Mobile).  So far I'm very happy with the device they sent me and I would recommend them to everyone else.  Except for one crash which I'm convinced was my doing, I haven't had any of the issues that other users have reported.  I'll update further if I run into any serious issues.  So far this phone has been a great upgrade from the Nexus One.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Near to Perfect Smart Phone, overall better than any nearest Rival", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2I8F3CN8073UL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have just completed one month of owning of Samsung Galaxy Nexus and I have no doubt declaring I am very happy with this. This is the best smart phone on the market for the time being until iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy S3 releases. I had iPhone 4 for 2 months and I like many other people who could not be satisfied with beauty and fruit brand alone threw that 'dumb beauty' . For me that was more of a 'show off' rather than of practical use.Apple itself in a recent patent suit directed against google termed this as the \"most creditable competitor to iPhone'. Apple co founder which is not a apple employee anymore and hence free to speak truth freely declared iPhone easy to use but 'Android more feature rich'. He dismissed Siri totally saying he could not understand how come internet could be needed to make a call through Siri. Do I need to say more now? If yes then here is the detail review:Like ->(1) Bigger HD contour display-> Though you can distinguish between pixels while looking closely unlike iPhone's Retina display, Nexus's display is gorgeous. Colors are very vibrant and rich. Black is real black (because of Super AMOLED display technology) which creates the whole difference.The Screen is large and with medium hands I can reach to the whole screen stretching the thumb or fingers. Sometimes I tend to use the other hand (luckily I have two hands and both are fully functional so can't complaint).Because of bigger screen this phone is more useful or convenient for what Apple invented iPhone for ie Browsing web, playing games, watching videos. And because of this I tend to depend lesser on PC/laptop/tablet. With bigger screen, power and customization of Android OS this phone is closer to our old friend PC/laptop.**I run the same HD video both on nexus and iPhone 4S and nexus one was better to watch.**(2) Soul-> The soul of this device is ICS OS which is now equal to iOS in terms of user friendlessness but is better because it is much more customizable and hence you feel completely in control and power. This is different feeling than using dumb iOS. After using ICS I really struggled to use the iOS or same iOS based apps. ICS is lightning fast and smooth.Face unlock, NFC, android beam and google wallet (not available on Verizon version) are very cool. Face unlock works perfectly.Built-in Data usage monitor is very helpful for not letting you go above your data limit.-> Mine is international unlocked version which within a week got automatically updated to 4.0.2 from 4.0.1.This has Best notification, better customization for web browsing.Ohhhhhhhh... did I tell you android has taken two steps which is miles ahead of time and going to change the things completely? (i) No Physical button-> The buttons are in fact part of OS itself and function well. Hence the buttons can now be context specific and smarter. They change their position depending on how you are holding the phone or what you are doing. While watching video they disappear completely giving you the whole screen for watching, and yes they will reappear on appropriate place when you need them. (ii) Same OS for all devices: Unlike Apple now same application can run on any device running on ICS. For apple the applications need to be written separately both for iPhone and iPad. That's why Apple has lesser applications on iPads. With new approach of ICS now people will just write once and run it anywhere hence number of apps is going to get multiplied faster on ICS.(3) Eco System (Apps)-> Android eco system (or app market) is there on par with Apple eco system. In the same period I have installed much more applications ($150-$200 of worth in Apple world AND YES ALL FREE!!!!!!!) than I did on iPhone 4 (because most applications are free compared to Apple). I am more functional on Android than I was on iPhone 4. There is nothing which I want and its not there. And yes now google going to start monitoring of applications so less argument against Android apps.(4) Form factor-> I like its form factor more than of iPhone's. Countered makes it more convenient to use and keep in the pocket. Now to me iPhone is just any another device and I look on iPhone with pity.(5) Battery-> I need to charge it once a day with low to moderate usage which is what other iPhone 4S customers are also doing. And if you are going to use it like laptop you will need to charge it more (is not this same with your laptop?). Better part is unlike iPhone you can carry batteries and change it easily. No complaint here.(6) Reception-> Decent.(7) Call quality-> Nice.(8) Volume/Speaker-> Low, could be helped with volume control plus application.(9) More social-> Very well integrated with google.(10). Build-> Except the battery cover everything else is of high quality. I don't care about plastic versus metal debate. iPhone even with metal and corning glass are equivalently fragile and people have been reporting iPhone being broken having dropped just from 12 feet or so. And with gorilla glass on both ends iPhone 4 is more fragile. Remember gorilla glass is just scratch resistant not damage resistant.(11) Typing-> is a breeze and it seems to read you mind and hence make typing a different experience than on iPhone. And big screen helps every here again.Unfortunately this phone decided to do have some deliberate suicidal traits perhaps to avoid wiping away other Samsung devices. So here are the things which could have been improved upon:(1) Speaker-> Could have been better (Minor+ issue)(2) Reception-> Though not much complaint, Could have been just a 'little' better (Very Minor issue).(3) Camera-> Could have been better definitely.(4) External Storage-> Either they should have allowed adding external storage or given the device with more alternated with respect to storage capacities. (Minor issue)(5) Display-> Should not be able to distinguish pixels (Minor issue but this should be ultimate goal for the display)Conclusion-> This is the best smart phone on the market for the time being if you can live with some minor issue with volume. And all issues reported so far with this device seem to be software issues and should get corrected with updates or third part applications.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Only Android phone anyone should buy!!", "Author": "Earl", "ReviewID": "R3HPD80SSQRHM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is the ONLY phone anyone interested in Android should purchase!The main reason for getting this phone is that it is updated directly from Google.

I had the nexus s and like it alot but this improves upon that. Lets talk about the Pros and Cons. Yes they are cons but you can judge how much they matter.**Cons:1.The back plate/panel that lets you access the battery is cheap. Dirt cheap. I hate it! Its too flimsy...but at least its flexible enough not to break. The nexus s back plate was stronger even though it too is plastic.2.The engine that guesses the words your trying to type and displays the options doesn't seem to \"learn\" as fast as the version on Ginger bread. Go figure. By this time my nexus s was a literal robot churning out those words seemingly before i could think em. This fellow is taking its time. Its improving but the difference is noticeable. I mean i type along quite nicely but i got accustom to just clicking a few letters and selecting the majically presented words before me.3.I have seen one instance when the OS seem to stutter as if it forgot what it was doing then..remembered and moved on. As i said.. thats more the OS than the device but never the less is part of this baby so it gets chewed . It wasn't anything intensive just a simple scoll when it happened.

Budrow", "ReviewID": "RGCTB0XL9JCMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even though the market right now shows phones like the HTC One, LG G2, Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy S4, and iPhone 5S (see what i did there), that doesn't mean you should ignore this smartphone. The Galaxy Nexus is one of the best devices still available. I use this device as my main smartphone, and it has probably been the best smartphone I ever owned. This review may be a little long, but I'll assure you it's worth reading some of the points. I'll start off with the pros.1. This is a NEXUS device.Nexus devices are Android phones and tablets that get the latest updates from Google, so your device will have the latest operating system, something that is rare on other devices. It currently uses Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean. Nexus devices also have no overlay, or skins from other manufacturers (There is no Touchwiz from Samsung, or Sense UI from HTC). However, recently, Google is starting to add stock android to current premium devices coming soon. They will most likely be known as Google Edition Devices, or Google Experience Devices (See my edit section for more info). Because of this, the phone is slightly faster, more memory is available for apps, etc. (not expandable), and no extra BLOATWARE!2. High resolution screen. Strong screen as well.The Galaxy nexus has a 316ppi display, and it is a HD Super AMOLED display. This means it has better viewing angles, and it turns off any unused pixels, for example, any black areas on the screen. This conserves lots of battery power. The screen is also less than 5 inches, something that is becoming a trend, and I honestly don't like this. Even though I do have big hands, and I have held a Note 2 with one hand, and I am able to use it without problems, I still think phones should be small enough to hold and keep in a pocket.Although the screen is not Gorilla Glass (I thought it was when I bought it), the screen is still strong. It uses a stronger fortified glass. It is also curved glass (contour display), so I believe its supposed to feel better in the hand.3. It gets things done, performance wise, and the software doesn't lag.The phone has a Texas instruments dual core processor, and for what I do (mainstream and average usage), it doesn't lag. On some games like Beach Buggy Blitz, it does lag a little, but nothing major. Jelly bean is very smooth and fast, and the softkeys (back, home, recent apps) on the bottom of the screen rarely freeze. They immediately respond.4. Other extra features included.One thing that I do use frequently is NFC or near field communication. I use it with NFC tags and TecTiles, so I can program basic actions. Its not something I completely recommend, as there are some tweaks needed, but the hardware part of NFC is perfect. I also use Google Wallet sometimes, as well as Android Beam to transfer files. The phone also has dual microphones (minor feature), and Bluetooth 3.0. Something unique is the POGO pin on the right side. When the phone first launched, there were accessories that allowed the phone to be charged faster with this connection, and other uses as well.The things that I didn't like from this phone (and NEXUS devices in general for some points). Most of these are not present in the \"Google Edition Devices\" made by Samsung and HTC.-DOESN'T HAVE A MICRO SD EXPANSION PORT. One of the reasons I switched from iphone to android, is so that I could expand my memory. The phone has 16 GB, but sometimes its not enough. Pretty much, no Nexus device has ever had an expansion port, except the first nexus device.-OK Battery life. I don't have a big problem with battery, but I have to charge this phone every night, and it won't at least keep even 50% for the next day. I don't use 4G LTE on this phone, so it could be worse. The phone does have a removable battery, which is a plus.-Camera... The camera is ok as well. The front facing one is fine, but the rear facing one is 5 megapixels. Sometimes 5 megapixels isn't enough for me. I'm still in school, and I do take lots of pics so it is important to me. Luckily, this phone does have 1080p recording, zero shutter lag, flash, autofocus, and Android 4.2.2 has built in editing functions. So it is a good camera, but it should be at least 8 megapixels. (The iPhone 4S had an 8 megapixel camera and it came out a similar time as the Galaxy Nexus.)*SMALL DETAIL: The phone is made out of plastic, but Samsung added a feature on the back of the phone, hyperskin, which allows for better grip and a better overall look to the phone.So in conclusion, the Galaxy nexus is a great phone. It is the best phone I have owned. Of course if I could personally customize it a little, it would probably be the best phone period, but it doesn't work like that. If you could ignore the 4G absence, no microsd expanison, and mediocre battery, then I recommend it.If you're considering this or the Nexus 4, the only major differences are that the Nexus 4 has a glass back, it has no removable battery, but it has wireless charging capabilities (have to buy an additional $60 charger), and it does not have a curved display, but it has Gorilla Glass. I would still recommend the Galaxy nexus over the Nexus 4.EDIT 1: Included mentions about the new Google Edition Devices- At Google I/O 2013, and at the D11 Conference, Google introduced \"their take on Android\", on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One. These 2 phones are very premium phones that are currently available through their carriers and manufacturers. These Google Experience devices will ship with stock Android (4.2.2). Although these seem like great phones, keep in mind that Google will sell them on their Play Store, unlocked starting at $599, for the HTC One, and $649 for the Galaxy S4. They will begin selling on the Play Store on June 26.The Nexus 4 is still expected to stay in stock on the store, and Google will not discontinue or replace the Nexus line of devices, so these devices will continue to be supported and updated by Google, so it still is a logical decision to buy the Galaxy Nexus.EDIT 2: Slight Issues with Speed and Performance- I have realized some lag on the phone after the phone was upgraded to Android 4.2.2, but I was not sure at the time if it was based on my apps on the phone. But I have now learned that the lag is also on the Nexus 7 tablet. So to be quick, this device will have slight lag whether it be on the home screen just scrolling pages, or playing a game of Dead Trigger. The lag is probably due to the amount of RAM available on the phone. Luckily, there are some ways you can avoid the lag. If you go in the developer settings on the phone, you can speed up the animations. Or you can also use another launcher from the Play Store (I am using Nova) to get rid of the lag on the home screen. In addition, the launcher app will have settings to potentially enhance your phone's performance. Lastly, try deleting apps, videos, or games that take up lots of space in your phone, or use up lots of RAM. Until this issue is solved in the next Android OS update (either Android 4.3 Jelly Bean or Android 5.0 Key Lime Pie), this remains a slight issue.EDIT 3 (8/2/2013): Google has recently announced Android 4.3, the latest operating system, and it is indeed compatible with Galaxy Nexus, and it runs perfectly. When I did update the phone, most of the lag seen on stock Android 4.2.2 disappeared. In addition to performance enhancements, there were also new features, notably the addition of Restricted Profiles (enhanced parental controls/limiting usage on other device accounts), Open GL ES 3.0, which brings graphics improvements for games, as well as Bluetooth LE, which allows better connectivity of \"low energy\" devices, such as smartwatches and upcoming wearables (Google Glass, maybe?)EDIT 4 (11/10/13): Google has announced Android 4.4 KitKat and unfortunately is not going to be available for Galaxy Nexus owners, so 4.3 is the last update until further notice. However, if you can take the risk, you can root the phone and flash a SlimKat custom ROM to have an unofficial build of KitKat on the device. For a few weeks, I have used this ROM and though there are some graphical glitches, I still think this is a good option. I am rooted, but I'd still prefer 4.3 with KitKat-based apps, including the Google Experience Launcher.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE this phone!", "Author": "Paul S. \"Paul S.\"", "ReviewID": "R7P8LDH1FQ3SV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first got introduced to android by the HTC G1/Dream, a few months after it was launched; I loved it. Last OS I remember using on it was FroYo (CyanogenMod). I replaced that phone for a Motorola Droid X, then I replaced the X for an HTC Sensation. I've always enjoyed rooting and romming the s**t out of my devices; and I was thinking about 3 devices when I got this one:HTC ONE X:  The Good: Quad core 1.5Ghz (the european version.. the att us version is dual core), fairly priced now, 1GB ram, 32GB, 8MP cam, FullHD video, GORGEOUS huge display, SenseUI is gorgeous and Sense4.0 is speedy and stable, rooting community likes the device, so theres plenty of development for it.  The Bad: No memory card expansion slot... that's a MAJOR problem for me... NO removable battery (just as bad).SAMSUNG GALAXY SIII:  The Good: Samsung seems to have done an excellent job on the TouchWiz interface, 16gb storage WITH microSD slot (for up to 64GB more!), 2GB ram (on the dual core, or a 1GB ram on a quad core), newest phone on the market, great display. Rooting/romming community response is uncertain, but this is a massively commercial device, so Im sure theres tons of devs out there working on this thing.  The Bad: price is still through the roof, its a Samsung... I hated the fact that they offer either a 2GB ram w/ Dual core OR a 1GB ram w/Quad core. I'm certain a 2GB ram dual core is way better though; but still, didnt like how theres no way to get the \"abolute monster phone\".SAMSUNG GALAXY NEXUS:  The Good: Cheapest of the 3. Its a Nexus phone! You get googles updates first. You get the full Android Experience. No bloatware. Sleek design, feels great on your hands (and pocket). Removable / replaceable battery.  The Bad: NO memory card slot. ONLY 16GB on the GSM version. NOT gorilla glass. Apparently Corning (manufacturer of gorilla glass) can't do the curvature on the end of this phone. But samsung states that its scratch resistant. After a full month or normal usage, theres not a single scratch, and I usually have it in my pocket along with coins and sometimes even keys.Note how \"it's a samsung\" is not a \"con\" for the Galaxy Nexus. As I hardly even notice it being a samsung phone. It feels nice and sturdy.I bought the Galaxy Nexus for ONE simple reason: It was the cheapest. I couldn't rule any of those 3 phones out, so, if these 3 phones were equally as desirable by me, and one of them was cheaper by a significant amount, THAT was a great reason to get it.

But if you develop apps for Android you should definitely get this phone, it's a no-brainer.Software.This device is all about software. Pure stock ICS experience is incredible. No custom manufacturer UI is as polished and usable as Google's. I'd say it's a revolution for Android. This device was designed for Android 4.0 and everything works flawlessly. I've been using the phone for over a month and I've had only 2 freezes first couple of days. I'm not sure what caused them, but I was on Android 4.0.1 back then (no issues on 4.0.4).One cool perk is that you'll get all Android updates first, because it's a Google phone. But be sure to buy \"yajku\" or \"takju\" variant because there are a lot of other variants that do not receive updates from Google directly. This was a big surprise for me when I got the phone. Most of them can be flashed \"yajku\" or \"takju\" and have the updates, but you won't the best Google experience out-of-the-box.Hardware.I consider this phone the best of what Samsung ever made in terms of body design. Even Galaxy S III, which was announced recently, looks not as good in my opinion (this glossy plastic body \"inspired by nature\" is not to my taste). Galaxy Nexus is matte gray with a rubbery feel battery cover (even if it's plastic). So no dust, dirt, scratches or fingerprints. It's slim and feels very nice in your hand but it's quite big. So if you have small hands it might be not for you.The screen is big, crisp with great colors and deep blacks. Although it has some of OLED disadvantages (grainy look and some banding on low brightness on some backgrounds) it's a great screen overall. I'm not sure if it's worse than HTC One X's and Galaxy S III's screens but I think it was the best before these came out. Yes, I think it's much better than iPhone 4S retina display (I've had plenty of time comparing these) but you may not agree if you prefer LCD over OLED. It's not perfectly readable under direct sunlight, but if you set the brightness to 100% it's usable. Note that the screen is a fingerprint magnet (as all touch screens are). The screen is beautifully curved but because of this it doesn't have Gorilla glass (which means it's more prone to scratches than many other phones).NOTE TO BUYERS AT AMAZON:Beware that there are a lot of variants of the Galaxy Nexus that don't receive direct Android updates from Google. I've bought here on Amazon one of these variants \"yakjudv\" (which is an Australian variant) from BRIGHT-POINT (Dolphin International Inc). This phone was stuck on 4.0.1 in April when 4.0.4 was already on many other Galaxy Nexus phones. So I've had to manually flash it with Google's \"yajku\" firmware to receive updates (and I've received one immediately after that).Also, if you are in the US, the best place to buy the Galaxy Nexus is Google Play Store.

I can just stream via WiFi when available or via my mobile data plan which is up to 5GB a month with T-Mobile's Monthly 4G No Annual Contract prepaid plan.The huge 4.65\" screen is a welcome beauty as my eyes thank me profusely for it! It's not too big for my pockets and it's not too small for my hands like I always felt the iPhone 4 was. I knew I wanted an increase not only in length but in width for my phone and when I saw the leaks a few months before the iPhone 5 was released, I knew they were real so I made up my mind to purchase an Android phone due to their generally larger screens. I do not regret my purchase! The screen, though not as pixel dense as the iPhone 4 or 5 (only 316 pixels per inch compared to the iPhone 4 & 5's 326 pixels per inch), I find it to be more vibrant and color rich. I watched some TV shows on Netflix as well as Avatar - Extended Edition and The Matrix from my phone's internal storage and marvelled at how beautiful the screen displayed the video. The audio, however, is the biggest and I think only downside of this device. Stock sounds are not loud at all. You must download an Equalizer or sound amplification app from Google Play's App Store to get any kind of sound out of the Galaxy Nexus to be able to comfortably hear it. This is referring to the ringer, notification sounds, etc. as well as the speaker and headset volume.I tremedously enjoy the inherent and extremely accurate Google Now which can be activated by voice and it's tied into Google's regular search engine as well as their Navigation app. I can merely say \"Navigate to...\" and it will search, find and give you turn-by-turn voice directions to your inquired destination. You can also say, \"Text [contact name]...\" with what you want to say and it's fairly accurate at doing just that as well. The only thing that is a tad bit irritating is the voice guidance on Navigation is a tad on the low side, volume-wise and is unable to be increased beyond the system-wide volume. There should be a setting that allows you to control the volume of your music while it's playing as well as voice navigation like I could with my GPS-Drive app from Apple's App Store that I used abundantly on my iPhone 4. I am considering rooting my Galaxy Nexus just to gain access to the source code for amplifying the volume which is something I shouldn't have to do with a phone. Google has been made aware of this on their support forums since the Galaxy Nexus released last year and has so far remained silent about a resolution which appears to be software-tweakable but primarily hardware-driven.And with the volume being mentioned, I have to also give a word on the quality of the music from Google's Music App on the phone itself. I must say, it is \"Okay\", but if I had to compare it to the quality of the iPhone's music, I would have to say it fails miserably!! But hey, you're talking about Apple, the company who makes the iPod, so I think the music from their phones should be top notch as well. I used to always complain about a lack of an equalizer, preferably 5 bands or more, on my iPhone 4, thinking I could make the music sound so much better. Boy, was I mislead after hearing music being played out of my Galaxy Nexus with a 5-band equalizer that reminds me of the sound quality of cassette tapes back in the day. And just to be clear, I understand many may not notice any audible distinction, but I assure you there is. I have been somewhat of an audiophile since I was a teenager and I notice the slightest nuances of aural fluctuations more than most people I know, so I know what I'm talking about. Either Samsung or Google needs step up the music quality in their phones or there will always appear to be a wide gulf between Apple's hardware and theirs.This phone's call quality seems to be very nice and my sister thinks it sounds clearer than my iPhone 4 did. At first I was thinking it may be because I'm now on T-Mobile's network instead of AT&T;'s, but I just remembered I did take the micro-SIM card out of my iPhone 4 and placed it into my Galaxy Nexus, called and talked to her. So call quality seems to be top notch but I would like to see Android design a little better interface for it. I think Apple's iOS has a more attractive interface for phone calls as a whole.As far as the build quality goes, it's nice, but it really can't beat the professional look, feel and quality of Apple's iPhone 4, 4S or 5. Apple just seems to make electronics with a stylish, elegant appearance that can rarely be matched in the industry in its entirety, not just in the cellular field. I mean, I enjoy the look of the Galaxy Nexus and it is actually noticeably lighter than my old iPhone 4, but it still looks a little cheap when you compare the two. I'm just being honest.There is one thing I miss on iOS that is not on Android's OS... \"UNDO\". Android is desperately in need of an \"Undo\" option while typing text. I can't tell you how many times I've highlighted text trying to copy it and mistakingly touched a key on the virtual keyboard only to see a carefully composed draft of several paragraphs wiped out with a keystroke... literally! There's no excuse for not updating the system with it at this point in time, especially since Google's tech support forum is overflowing with comments and requests to implement it as soon as possible. I believe the first of such requests was as early as a few years ago. So for them not to include it in Gingerbread or Jelly Bean is kind of unforgiveable. What? Do they think they'll become more like Apple's iOS? If so, here's news for you, Android... \"Undo\" has been a part of Windows OS's for quite some time now. DO IT! Or should I say UNDO IT!?UPDATE #1: I just unlocked and rooted my Galaxy Nexus and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy! The learning curve is much steeper than jailbreaking and unlocking Apple's iOS devices. I would charge people $50 to root and unlock Android devices because it's a PAIN! But I'm happy because I was able to increase the volume of the phone's sounds, notifications, speakers and headset speakers. It also installed an equalizer that is now stock and not app related. They call it the Awesome BEATS rom mod for Nexus devices. It sounds fantastic and it's now better sound than I had on my iPhone 4... FINALLY!UPDATE #2: I want to mention something I've come to dislike over the last year with this phone - the power button being on the right side opposite the volume rocker on the left side. Many people prefer this button design but I have to differ since I seem to always press the volume rocker in addition to the power button due to their parallel proximity. This may have a little to do with the case as I have to press harder than I normally would if there were no case, but it is still an annoyance just the same.The other thing I'd like to mention is I truly dislike the fact that the Nexus line chose to mimic Apple and refuse to put expandable storage on their devices. It's really confounding since they didn't even match the iPhone's storage capacities. If you're going to force people to use your cloud services without a local storage option, at least give them additional HDD sizes like 32GB and 64GB for their top tier handsets. That's easier to swallow than limiting it to 16GB which is not enough in this digital age when people find it hard to believe that not everyone uses \"The Cloud\"!All in all, even after the advent of the HTC One and the Samsung Galaxy S4, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus still holds its own for the value. It's not restricted like its later iteration, the Nexus 4, as it allows you to remove or upgrade the battery to a more capable one, and you can still download and utilize most apps from Google's App Store as they are still compatible with it. I would still highly recommend the purchase to anyone.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, careful where you buy it", "Author": "Aj", "ReviewID": "R3BJP57AKDY6P1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a  review for those who might be on the fence about buying a Galaxy Nexus.  I am not a phone expert, just a user who has used an iphone for the last couple years and looking for a change away from the fruit.  First impression out of the box -- wow!!  The colors are much more vivid and the navigation is simple and more fluid, there's only minor differences to get used to such as the on/off button being on the right side of the phone instead of the top, and learning the difference between the home screen and the app screen.  The phone is slightly taller but much thinner and lighter than my iphone, the Nexus feels good in your hand and button placement was smart. To get your contacts from the iphone to the Nexus is a simple process, you can either use itunes to backup your contacts to your Google account or even easier just download the BUMP app on both phones and instantly transfer all of your contacts at once over to the Nexus (yes, your iphone will still work perfectly without a sim card on it just make sure you have wifi access where you are at).I opened the box, took off the phones back cover, put in the battery, slipped in my old Tmobile 4g prepaid sim card (and quickly called Tmobile to give them my new phone's IMEI number so they could give it permission to access their network). Easy! In the box was also a headset (earbuds w mic, actually comfortable compared to my old iphone earbuds), and the wall charger that doubles as a usb data charger/connection to your computer since the data cord snaps into the small wall plug, convenient!IMPORTANT NOTE -- if you buy your Nexus from anywhere other than the Google Play store, such as the phone in this listing, there is a good chance that it is not factory unlocked and that the 3rd party seller opened the box and unlocked the phone themselves.  Not a horrible thing, but something to be aware of if you don't know the sellers reputation.  There is also a good chance that it will have the Samsung software configuration and not the popular Google software configuration.  If you have the Samsung config you will always be a step behind in updates since Google pampers this awesome phone and makes sure its version is kept current (version 4.04 at the time of writing this).  Point being if you want the latest updates first buy the phone direct from the Google Play store, otherwise there's nothing wrong with having the Samsung configuration version of the phone.  You will love the phone no matter what, it's easy and fun to use. If you are a heavy phone user watching lots of videos or play a lot of games you might want to pick up an extra battery for the phone, unlike the iphone it's easy to plop another one in on the Nexus.Things that impressed me the most -- upon plugging the phone in via usb to the pc you instantly have access to copy/paste files to the ringtones folder, photos, wallpaper, etc.... this was always a nightmare on the iphone for me since the fruit company locks everything down and makes it annoying to do anything without that bloated itunes program and 3rd party apps, custom iphone ringtones were always a pain because you had to convert them to a special file format first and were limited on ringtone file size. NO MORE with this great phone, just drag and drop your mp3s on this puppy and you can play them or assign custom ringtones for each person.  Point being, customization is made simple on the Nexus.  Out of the box it's a stock unrooted Nexus in all its glory.  If you are an ultra geek you can customize the phone even deeper by flashing your favorite custom ROM on the phone, which if you aren't familiar with that it essentially lets you tweak the phone even further to update the os to increase performance, battery life, add new visuals and options, etc. (not necessary, but it is a fun option if you like to tinker and have some geek in you).The only con of the phone, and I hate to even call it that, is the 5mp camera.  Most smartphones nowadays have at least 8mp.  I take a lot of photos with my phone, and to be honest 5mp is plenty of the average user.  The photos I've taken so far were crisp and bright, no complaints.  In deciding between the Nexus and the newly launched Galaxy S3, the Nexus has much better battery life and is half the price. WINNER! :) It would have been nice to have the FM radio feature of the S3, but with all the free internet radio available to me it's not a dealbreaker. Another great note, the famed \"S voice\" on the newest Galaxy S3 (the answer the Iphones Siri voice) is also available to add to the Galaxy Nexus, so if you like to talk to your phone and have it talk back there's one more reason to love this phone. Once you have the phone in your hand you will forget about the fruit phone and embrace the Nexus in all its glory.If you buy a car charger I recommend the Motorola micro-USB one that can be bought from this site, it's around five dollars and is more powerful than other chargers and can keep up with the battery charge needs if you use your phone for GPS.

Both broken.", "Author": "Winston", "ReviewID": "RUTNIG3KHBMLB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This rating is for my experiences with the UNLOCKED Samsung Galaxy Nexus.Look, I loved this phone even before it came out. I was technologically obsessed with it. So, listen to my story with patience and you'll understand my frustrations.I pre-ordered the Samsung Galaxy Nexus unlocked model from an online website called Negri Electronics because they were offering it at a lower price than other sites. When it arrived, I was ecstatic. The phone was beautiful. It fits nicely in your hands, not too big and not too small. The new operating system is smooth, slick and undeniably the best that android has to offer. I used T-mobile's no-contract pre-paid data plan. (If you're in the U.S, you'd know that t-mobile has been aggressively marketing it.)After 2 months, inexplicably my phone just died. Instantaneously. It just suddenly shuts itself off while I was opening up the google maps app. After this, I cannot go to the home screen. No matter what I did. When I turn it on, it shows me the starting Google logo and then it dieds and restarts itself. And this cycle will repeat itself until the battery gives out. For your information, I did not \"root\" it or do anything else funky with my phone. I simply downloaded apps from the market and used it normally. And I always pride myself on taking care of my stuff. I thought okay, maybe I didn't take care of it good enough or maybe I'm just unlucky to get a phone with the glitch. So I sent it for repair under its warranty.Then, I bought myself another unlocked phone while waiting for the repairs to finish. The exact same thing. This time I bought it through Amazon on this damn page. Everything worked well just as before but. Can you guess what happened in 1.5 months? Yeah. It broke down again in the exact same way. Switched off all of a sudden again. This time when I turn it on, it got past the initial Google logo and to the fancy light show. Then, it will unexplainably restart itself again before reaching the home screen. Until the battery is used up. I was like wtf. This is ridiculous. Is it because I'm using an international phone in the U.S? Does technology just hate me?I was furious. I called Amazon customer service. They said it is already past 30 days for a return. Amazon told me to call the third party seller, WorldWide Distributors. They said it is already past 30 days for a return, they can't do anything about it. Tells me to call Samsung. I called Samsung, they said they don't have my international phone on their records so they told me to call Samsung International in the UK. When I called them, they are already closed by 6pm.So, that leaves me here right now to advise you.Before my phones broke, I love it. Hands down, it is the best android phone on the market right now. Sure, the phone's camera doesn't have as many megapixels as others. But it gets the job done faster through its insane shutter speed. And if you want megapixels, megapixels, megapixels, geez why not just get a camera instead of a phone?If you want to get this phone in the U.S, use a carrier so they can handle everything for you. Sure, it's more expensive. But it's sure as hell better than getting kicked around by \"customer service\". I'm so frustrated I seriously thought about getting an iphone. Yeah, go on. Judge me.As for this Unlocked-Galaxy-Nexus curse of not lasting more than 2 months, please tell me that I am not the only one with this problem. Otherwise, it'd just be too sad.Edit: I downloaded and used the GN Official Update Checker app on both phones. Both are of the \"yakju\" variant.Edit-Edit: I fixed the second phone by rooting it. lol? Nobody in Samsung cares.

I've only had it for about 5 hours now so I can't really do a full review but my first impression is very good.Pros+Big, vibrant screen:~~It takes some getting used to if you haven't had such a big screen on a phone before, like me. It's like 'holy crap?! this is huge!' but you get used to it+Android 4.0:~~It's fast, smooth, beautiful. As a first time Android owner I can't really say how much of an improvement it is but I can say it's really nice.+Cameras:~~Front facing camera for video chat, etc. Rear camera is 5mp, not the best, but it gets the job done. To long-time smart phone users, it may seem like \"front facing camera, 5mp camera? big deal\" ~~but to me it's really nice.+16gb of storage:~~I would have liked more, but I think 16gb will be plenty. I'm sure it will hold a couple thousand songs and a hundred or so apps, at least, and that's all I think I'll need. The device is supposedly available in 32gb version, but I couldn't find one.+Google Music~~Not specific to this phone, but it's a great service and it works great with this phone. Store up to 20,000 songs in the cloud for free and stream them on your phone? Awesome.Cons-Plastic~~It's not really that bad, but for this price, they could have used metal or maybe even rubber to make it more durable, at least for the back. The battery cover is a thin piece of plastic and it just doesn't seem to really belong on the device.-No expandable storage~~I think 16gb will be enough for the average user, but the freedom of a microSD card slot is a huge plus and it just seems like it would be a no-brainer for such a quality device, yet it's missing. This is the primary reason I knocked the phone down a star.-Quiet speaker~~People at my work are always showing each other music from their phones and the speaker on the Galaxy Nexus is about half as loud as every one else's there. You can't even hear it unless it's quiet in the room. However, the phone comes with headphones; they aren't the best but they are pretty decent.~Also, I'm not sure about the buttonless front. I kinda just naturally go the bottom with my thumb whenever I want to wake the phone up because that's how most phones are, but here you have to use the power/hold button on the right side. Maybe I'll get used to it. Not annoying enough to be negative, and not buttons allows for more screen, but I'm just not used to it.I'll have to update this when I have more time with it.

I got it new from ebay and the box had the samsung UK seal on it. As soon as I placed my T-Mobile sim card from my former Galaxy SII SGH-T989 and turned this phone on, the signal was on E then within seconds it went to 3G then to H. It prompted me for update of OS of around 8.7MB. I checked the OS version afterwards and it was 4.0.2 and the app that checks for YAKJU build confirmed this was pure google OS and that it will get latest updates directly from google. After a week went by the phone was working flawlessly no random reboot no freezes just smooth ICS but I wanted 4.0.4 update since I heard how much it improves the OS. After trying the manual update mode several times I decided to boot it using power and both volume up/down button to check the specs. Mines didn't have PRIMELA03 bootloader and other stuff written there didn't match phones that had been flashed with google OS from googles developer website. So after trying several times I finally got the universal drivers to install on my windows 7 pc and proceeded to flash the latest ICS version 4.0.4. I did everything as instructed on the web but now I was unsure if my phone would be able to download future updates and install them without issues. So I flashed my phone again but with version 4.0.4 build #: IMM76D which from what I heard had radio/signal issues and google had to push out build number IMM76I to fix it. After I flashed and relocked the bootloader the phone turned on and prompted for a very small OS update and downloaded and installed without any issues. As far as I can tell this phone is awesome if you can tweak it once to get the actual google ICS image directly from google. Mines has been working for over a week now on the latest update and it has been flawless smooth and fluid ICS OS no freezes like my galaxy SII which still uses gigngerbread 2.3.6 and the added touchwiz which I hated.

I'm happy I went with this phone.  The new Nexus 4 was just announced, and while it is a bit of an upgrade, I needed a phone quickly, so I couldn't wait three weeks for the Nexus 4.  The Galaxy Nexus is living up to the hype so far.  The version I received is the pure Google version, not a Japanese Docomo phone, as many people have reported.  Mine came from Worldwide Distributors, fwiw.  Within minutes it received an OTA update to Jellybean, the latest version of Android, and I'm sure when Android 4.2 comes out in the next few weeks, it will get that too.  I previously had a Motorola Triumph with Virgin Mobile.  That phone was laggy and often unresponsive.  It began randomly rebooting once every few days after I'd had it for a year.  My new Galaxy Nexus is super-responsive, clear, and full-featured.  I switched over to T-mobile's prepaid plan, and I'm not looking back.  This phone is 3G, but works on T-mo's \"4G\" network (i.e., HSPA+).  I checked network speeds today using the Speedtest app, and had 4.8 MB dl & 1.8 MB upload speeds.  It's not true 4G, but it's much faster than my old VM service.  I'm using GrooveIP with my Google Voice number and making outgoing calls over the data network, which is working great, and I'm not using any of my very limited mobile minutes.  If you haven't used Android 4.1, it's a very nice OS.  I'm using the new Google Now feature quite a bit.  You can swipe up from the bottom of the homescreen or lockscreen to get to it.  Google Now consists of a set of customized cards, each with relevant information (next appointment, sports scores, directions, weather, etc.).  I especially like that the OS gives me reminders for my next appointment, and even estimates my travel time to get there, alerting me a few minutes early so that I have time to travel.  And it's nice that it's automatic.  I run with my phone, and use Runtastic to track my progress.  My old Motorola Triumph was horrible at getting a GPS lock (well known fault of that phone).  This one locks within seconds, and I'm off.  I use Stitcher Radio at the same time to listen to podcasts or Spotify for music, and it works seamlessly.  Best of all, I've been pleasantly surprised by the battery life.  I got used to plugging my Triumph into my car charger while on the road, or plugging it in while at work, so it wouldn't run out of juice by the end of the day.  The Galaxy Nexus seems to last all day for me, so when I plug it in at 11 p.m., it still had 40% power left.  This is with the stock battery, and moderate usage.  Obviously high-power users won't get that much life out of it, but it works great for me.  I was wary of moving up to a bigger phone, since my 4\" Triumph seemed to be a good size.  The size of the GNex is great, however.  It's thin enough to slide in my pocket, and the slight curve to the screen glass actually seems to make it fit better.  I put it in a Cruzerlite TPU case, and that adds a little bulk, but not much.  I was going to go straight out and buy a big battery after reading reviews here, but I'm glad I didn't.  Some of those batteries really add thickness to the phone, and I'm getting good battery life out of the stock battery (which also has NFC, which I haven't used yet).  If you're thinking about this phone or the Nexus 4, you might want to wait a couple of weeks until the Nexus 4 is available.  It has a quadcore processor (this one's dualcore), a higher resolution screen (the GNex is great though), and a few more bells and whistles.  Neither the Nexus 4 nor this GNex has a micro-SD slot, which is a bit of a downside in my book.  I'd love to be able to put a 32GB (or 64GB!) card in my phone and completely replace my mp3 player (a Zune HD - which I still love after 3 years of heavy use!).  But if you have a pretty good data network, you might find that streaming media from the cloud will work for you - it does for me so far. Plus, I like having a dedicated music player, even if it is one more thing to carry around.  So I have no regrets with this phone.

And applications can't fix it because Google won't let applications change the time on the phone, unless it's rooted.* The back cover, where the battery is took a little while to get use to snapping it back on - I thought I was going to break one of the plastic hooks.  It seems flimsy, but once it's on there it's fine and feels solid.Otherwise I'm very happy.

Sharper than iPad 2 (because it is similar resolution in a smaller physical package).

Currently better compatibility with their networks, and not as \"steal worthy\" as an iPhone. Don't want to see my phone \"walk away\" or get grabbed away, which has been happening to more and more friends over there.

Coupled with other cloud-based apps like Dropbox (I'll eventually switch to Google Drive since it offers 5 times the storage and is also free) and Evernote, all of my organizing needs are pretty much squared away.Sure, the other apps and features are nice too: Jet Audio for beautiful music playback, VLC player for video, Chrome for web surfing, Flixster, Google Maps, News and Weather feeds, Calculator, Stopwatch/Timer, Voice Recorder, Camera, Skype, etc.  But 70% of my non-phone usage with this device is still mainly work/organizing related.  Don't really have the time or desire to go comb through the thousands of available apps out there, so I think that 16GB of storage this device comes with will be more than sufficient.I was not happy with the battery life, until I downloaded the free Easy Battery Saver, which has at least doubled my battery life...it does so by disconnecting the internet whenever in Sleep Mode, so you have to tolerate a 5-10 second reconnect time every time you wake it up.  Now I am averaging about 36 hours between charges with moderate use.  I still wish it could go for 3-4 days on a single charge like my 3 year old Samsung Star phone could, but of course that's apples and oranges.  Still, this battery limitation does contribute to my reluctance to frequently use this device as a music/video player, GPS, etc.  So although it is CAPABLE of being an all-in-one multipurpose device in theory and specs, the battery does discourage that in reality.  This is pretty much a given in all smartphones these days though, with the possible exception of the iPhone but I refuse to pay almost twice as much to join Apple's evil closed ecosystem.However, I am happy to say that this phone doesn't have much of the annoying system lag of my ancient Samsung Star phone---it happens maybe 5-10% of the time, tops unlike with the Star it was more like 50/50 if the darn screen would register a tap or swipe the first time.  So I guess the dual-core processor is no joke.  When I first got it, I sort of went overboard with deleting or uninstalling all the apps that I didn't see myself ever using, including the Google ones...I ignored the pop-up windows warning of possible system malfunction, and whaddaya know, after half a day the darn thing froze up on me and I had to do a manual reset.  Miraculously, my online Google account saved about 75% of my settings, so when I restarted the device from default I didn't have to reinstall everything.  Now I have to admit that I am much, much more cautious/tolerant of the built-in Google apps I don't use...I've left them alone and haven't had a single hiccup since.I noticed that the battery cover is a bit flimsy right off the bat, it was one of the driving factors that led me to spend twenty three bucks for an Otterbox Defender case with rigid screen protector...worth every penny!  Now am super confident that this baby will survive ANY kind of mishap or abuse I put it through.4 stars, due to so-so battery life and Google bloatware apps that apparently cannot be disabled or removed without ill consequences...if it were about a hundred dollars less I'd happily give 5 stars.

Once again we had to send it to Texas for repair.  We received the phone this morning and it is missing the SIM card and the back cover.

There are many, as overall it is a great phone.  However there are a few BIG cons that need to be mentioned.  Keep in mind I upgraded from a Galaxy S Sprint Slide phone. (A great phone).  So I have a point of reference.  I used that phone for nearly two years.A couple major \"CONs\" that I have are these:1.  When I am outside and the phone rings. I cannot see the screen to unlock it and answer it. Brightness set to maximum, and still no luck.  This is a major annoyance as I am outside frequently. The phone rings, and all I see is a black screen.  I end up hitting the power button because you are conditioned to do that to activate the display, and that silences the call.  Annoying. Highly Annoying. I'm open to suggestions here.2. Battery life. I understand having a high powered computer in your pocket requires high power. My old phone was a high powered computer and had to charge it everyday. This phone, (with wireless off, and GPS off) will lose its battery within 4 hours if you are using the phone as a normal user might use it.  I do admit, if you keep it in your pocket and don't look at it for 4 hours, most of the battery will be left.  But if you check your phone like most do, say every 20 minutes for an email, a facebook post, or to text someone, the battery will be gone.  While in use, the display devours the battery.  1% per minute by my calculations just being on.  Doing other things with it sucks the power even faster.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works on T-MO!

I'm happy to report that this phone is working without issue on TMO.  I was able to make calls immediately after inserting my SIM card and I noted that I was immediately receiving an in-network HSPA signal from the carrier.  I was mildly concerned when I read a review about the OS being locked, and the main reason I'm writing this review is to confirm that within about five minutes of use I received an on-air update to ICS 4.0.2.  It therefore does not appear to me that the OS could be locked.Interesting side note:  I know these phones come from Europe as there is no GSM version of the Galaxy Nexus for sale in the USA right now.  It appears mine was originally destined for Poland because the back of the Galaxy Nexus box was printed exclusively in Polish, as was the little instruction booklet inside.  The phone booted up in English however, and I haven't had to make any adjustments whatsoever for language, time zone, keyboard, charger (the Euro type-C plug with USB port comes packaged with an adapter for US type-A outlets), etc.  In fact, I've encountered no problems with the phone whatsoever.  Others have commented better than me... but this is a great phone! Even the camera, although critically panned for being only 5mp's, takes amazingly good pictures -- even in low light without a flash!

And now that I'm running the stock Google image I should get OTA updates much faster.Not much else to say that hasn't already been said by others.  I agree that the case (especially the batter cover) seems sort of flimsy.  However it is very easy to remove and I'm not worried about breaking anything as there is a lot of give to it.  And if you purchase a decent case (I picked up the Diztronic flexible) as well as a screen protector (I got the Skinomi) I think you'll be in good shape.If you enjoy the Android experience by all means grab this phone.

Before this one, i had a Blackberry 8520 for almost 3 years. So, as you can imagine, for me it was a huge leap going from my old rusty Gemini to the Nexus.I've been with this phone for a few days, and still getting to know it, because i'm kinda new on Android. The first thing that impressed me was the size. I did a lot of research about the Nexus, and knew from all the reviews that this thing was big. Let me tell you, once you hold it in your hand, you realize that it's bigger than you think.Once i turned on the phone i was blown away. The size of the screen, the vivid colors, the sharpness of the images is AMAZING. I know some people will tell me that the iPhone 4's looks better with the Retina Display and blah, blah, but remember i came from a BB Gemini.The touchscreen is really responsive. I heard that Android phones had a little lag when touching the screen, but i didn't experience anything like that so far. It feels very natural.As you may know, the Galaxy Nexus comes with the brand new Android OS 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). It's a good looking OS, very intuitive and smooth without getting too simple like the iOS, which is fine by me, because the variety of settings that i can change makes me feel that i'm holding a very powerful device. By the way, the Galaxy Nexus is fast. I can use 3 or 4 apps on multitask without any slowdowns.The call quality is good, but sometimes the reception gets unstable when i'm inside my office.All the reviews i've read complained about the camera, because its quality was below the standard for this kind of device. But i gotta say, i'm happy with it. Coming from the really crappy camera of the BB Gemini to the one that the Galaxy Nexus has is a big change.Also, there were complains about how low the sound from the external speaker was, which is something i have to agree with. You'll have no problem with that inside your home, or inside an office. But you may have trouble hearing someone calling you if you have your phone inside a purse, or if you are in crowded areas.Overall, i'm really satisfied with my phone.

This is my first Google Nexus i9250 32GB and I am a Motorola user, LG user (hate LG by the way), and Samsung user and I tried Nokia (also, hate Nokia). I abuse my phone so, yes I will give the good and the bad. (I even bought the Google Nexus 4 but, who cares for the GNex4 right now).Note: Streaming videos/music will be omitted, for it depends on one's carrier and location of service area. Also, android beaming will also be omitted (for the love of me, I cannot and still cannot figure out how that works or rather, I am just lazy, so my apologies).Pros:-camera and video usage is excellent for any time of the day.  Zoom is great which is better than average as I would rate it when compared to a camera. (I could care less for camera usage because I need the phone to work as a phone, not a camera).-Slim design and lightweight. (sometimes I do not notice it in my pocket that I would have to check to make sure its there and not slipped out of my pocket).-durable, still works after falling to the ground (gel case kinda crappy case though), and being thrown around. Batteries does not fall out, stays in place (you will understand when you own one) because the back keeps it in place.-charger plug is usable in any country's outlet (they gave me that one, lucky me).-Screen is wider and longer than a Samsung (any).-WiFi, Bluetooth, Tethering & portable hotspot works excellent.-User interface is excellent, easy to understand, easy to set-up and user-friendly.-Looks good.-Vibration is more reliable than ringtone!Cons:-Too big for my hands. I have to text using two hands instead of one, which I normally like to do but, now I cannot with this phone. My hands are big compare to the average female Asian's hands, but small when compared to the average White-American male hand and about the same size to the average White-American female hands. I am Asian-American by the way and my hands are big.-Cannot handle multitasking or multiple running apps. It over-heats when using the internet and using an app and sometimes freezes.  The process slows down by a large margin (I really wanted to break this phone). Had to use a similar program to Crap Cleaner (for PC), I used Clean Master (app for phone) to cancel un-used running process/apps.-When I access Google Nexus directories, folders are all over the place. (I like to be organized) and cannot delete some useless programs and folders, sometimes, having to go into the folder to delete one thing at a time and THEN, it allows you to delete the folder.-I have to be part of Google related stuff/social network and it does updates that I really do not like at all (sometimes without my approval. Some updates are useless that just want to take up memory and space and we cannot delete it, but just have put up with it). Other than that, Google is friendly.-After a year, now 2 years that Google Nexus came out, no one knows about this phone. Hard to find a replacement screen protector and case for the longest time.  (Even Chinatown doesn't know it).-Default ringtone is not loud enough. I cannot hear from another room (silent environment), in the toilet, in my front pocket or the back pocket. The only loud ringtone I can find its Rock, Heavy-metal or something similar to those.-Hearing on the other end is do-able but I cannot say it's all that great. (I have good hearing)-Navigator's voice and speaker is not loud enough. (Let's just say we need some volume control here)-Like most phone, I have to charge the battery every night. (I am not a heavy text'er or caller or internet user or gamer on this phone). Just a few calls, text, and checking emails on a daily basis for work and personal interaction. It will last me at most 8-9 hours before the batteries go RED. When using the navigator on and batteries at full charge, the battery will last maybe 2-3 hours.-Android Version 4.2.1 (it said Jelly Bean in Ads and People's reviews, so I expect one, but personally I don't care).Personally I do not like Google Nexus after using it (and Google Nexus 4 didn't help either), but OVERALL, personal feelings aside, I can kinda, sort of ... recommend this phone for basic usage only, but not for a business class usage.  I would give this to a high school'er or a fresh college student.  I would even put this as a temporary phone.  It is reliable enough and it does its job as a simple basic phone. (If you cannot decide between the Google Nexus i9250 or the Google Nexus 4, the Google Nexus 4 is the same thing except, its outer appearance is different. Just my 2 cent).Good Luck in choosing your next phone!", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Becareful of this phone, It became locked in Trinidad after 3 weeks of use.", "Author": "William B Connolly", "ReviewID": "R2NUGQ7YRH848Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I liked this phone but battery life is nothing like my galaxy Note 2.

It is the version that can be easily converted between software versions using the Factory Images available on the Android site.In short, this is a great device. It does not have the best construction quality (noticeable, rough edges at one side of the front), it's a Samsung after all, but when it launched it had everything, including an HD screen with a resolution that, even today (feb 2014), the iPhone can't match. The PenTile arrangement didn't bother me at all, and images were crisp enough. Of course they were not as crisp as a full RGB HD, but it was better than what other phones had to offer in the OLED camp. That said, the OLED at that resolution was marvelous to look at (today we are spoiled by 1080p screens), especially because the unmatched contrast made possible by black pixels that actually are black when black. :)Burn out of the blue pixels still are not a pronounced issue. You can't normally notice, only under specific backgrounds. It is much, much less than the Nexus S I had before it, and most of it is also transitory (disappears after a few seconds). Some of it is permanent, however. As I said, it does not bother me even today.More than 2 years later, I'm moving towards a Nexus 5, but this phone is still impressive and can handle basically all apps except those that need graphics performance (like games). Also, this phone received the last official update last year, so it won't have (officially, at least) Android 4.4/KitKat. However, regarding compatibility, you shouldn't have problems for a long time. Since Android 4.3/Jelly Bean already had major components that apps use in a daily-basis, this isn't, by any means, a compatibility problem anywhere near the break that 3.0;3.2/Honeycomb and 4.0/Ice Cream Sandwich were. The performance is also decent even today: on a daily basis, it is smoother than many higher end phones that were launched after the Galaxy Nexus. The fact that the Nexus line software is slim, not bloated, also helps.I don't think anyone should buy it (a 2.5 years old model after all) for this price (there are many better devices much cheaper). A bit more and you can get a Nexus 5.

I'll update this review with the results of my return process.  First the reasons why I'm returning the phone:- The phone keeps dropping cell service.  Zero bars, and the message \"No Service\" appears.  Toggling airplane mode, manually searching for networks, rebooting, and reboot with battery pull all do nothing.  Then mysteriously it will start working again for a while, with full bars (which is the normal condition for T-Mobile from my home and work).  Reviews online don't suggest this is a common problem for this phone; it just appears defective.- Volume down button sticks.  I kept noticing that the phone was always on vibrate only.  Then one time I rebooted it and the phone started up in ODIN recovery mode (which is power+volume-down).  If I tap a few times on the volume down I can unstick it, but it will stick again later.  Reviews online suggest this phone is somewhat susceptible to button failures, probably from use over time.- The phone was not new as advertised by the seller.  The box did have an unbroken Samsung seal, but that seal had been placed *over* an original seal that had been broken.  I suspect this is a refurbished phone, and I'm disappointed that the seller was not careful enough to accurate list the product.  I'm not sure a used 2+ year old phone with no warranty is worth $250.I do like this phone model.  Here are my favorite features:- Data on T-Mobile 4G is very fast, at least compared to my older 3G phone.- Battery life seems to be good.  Minimal use but push e-mail nets me about 18 hours or so between charges.- Uses a mini-SIM card (this the earlier SIM form factor, larger than the micro-SIM most smart phones are now using).  This way I can use my older phone as a backup (same SIM card form factor).- Screen is gorgeous- Processor is zippy; no lags in the UI to my eye.- Google supports this phone with Android 4.3.- I have a friend who purchased one of these when it first came out and it has been rock solid for him over the years.There were a few downsides to this phone that I perceive to be design issues and not endemic to this particular phone:- Call quality is OK, but I heard some echo a few times, and so did a caller, once.- Loudspeaker volume is weak enough to be somewhat unusable.  My old Galaxy S is significantly louder.I like this phone model, and hope the seller is able to replace this defective one with a truly new one as advertised.UPDATE: 09/18/2013I'm late updating this review.  The seller, On The Go Solutions, was responsive.  I asked for a replaecment, but in new condition as advertised.

It shows that it's charging most of the time (even when it's not), often it starts jumping between showing that it's charging and that it's not, which turns on the screen all the time. I turn off the screen, and a moment later it turns it back on until I either turn it off or put it on the charger. Today it also started making weird sounds every once in a while.

Now I carry a battery with me and have no problems with having the phone last the entire day without it dying out.All in all, very happy with the purchase. The Gnexus is the best Android phone in 2011, 2012 and possibly part of 2013 as well.UPDATE: After using this phone for around a year, I rooted it, installed many custom ROMS and mods and I'm still happy with my purchase. Currently running CM 10.2 ROM, and it works perfectly. Yes, the Galaxy Nexus won't get an official KitKit upgrade from Google, but I'm pretty sure there will be a Kitkat ROM for it out there eventually. If not, there are many many different ROMs out there, and that was the whole point of a Nexus device - it's a developer's phone that can be customized to one's need. Besides, there isn't much Kitkat has to offer anyway that would completely change your lifestyle.

The Galaxy III is an awesome newer Android phone, but with the faster processor you lose battery life.  The Nexus is the perfect balance of a fast, awesome Android 4 smartphone that also has great battery life compared to anything in its class.  Not only will it make it through a full day for me, if I don't use it much it can make it through the greater part of a second day if I forget to recharge it.

But it's still worth the money :)It's not flawlessly fast like some of the higher end Android phones (you can tell this difference if you use live wallpapers and have programs running- compare from phone to phone), but for most people this won't be an issue at all.

Marriott", "ReviewID": "R3C689YIM004KE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone directly from Google.It is a great phone, Android 4.1 is very smooth, great UI. The screen is nice and big. It does not lag if you have a lot of applications on it. It has enough Ram that you do not have to constantly stop applications to be able to use it smoothly.The only negatives about this phone that I can point out are that it does not have an external memory card slot. So the 16 Gb of internal memory is all that you have for storage. (Why?!) That fact makes this phone that would have been perfect not perfect. The battery is undersized if you use the phone with data all day, but that is typical for all new smartphones as they are trying to make them thinner and thinner. The battery is not overly undersized like previous phones I have used (Samsung Epic)but it could have more capacity. Also if you have movies on Samsung Media Hub, do not assume that since this is a Samsung phone that you can use that application on this device. You cannot. This is a problem with Samsung and their selection of devices they allow you to use the application on.3/24/2013:  I have to add that part of the reason Google did not design their phone with an external sd card slot is for security. This does not explain why their phone couldn't come with 32 gb of memory. 16 gb is just too little for most people. I use this phone like my mobile laptop because it can do ANYTHING a laptop can except play games. Also two updates ago Google improved the camera with a feature that I find just EXCEPTIONAL: you can now take spherical panorama pics. And they come out just great! It is a great feature to have when you are out traveling. These spherical panorama pics just capture the feel of an area like no other picture can.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "a good cel", "Author": "archo68", "ReviewID": "R1PASEJ9YXQVKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "buy this phone for my daughter with some trepidation, but I received it in good condition and everything works fine.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great smart phone but has some network issues.", "Author": "Taeho Oh", "ReviewID": "R1K4OA4TKUSL0V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a great smart phone but network is sometimes completely disconnected.

Once the phone is turned on for the first time, automatic update showed up immediately for the Jellybean update. Yes, you can count this as a Jellybean phone instead of ICS. It's very fast, fluid - animations are butterly smooth. Compatibility of apps and games are indeed at a top of the charts. For the screen, its not much as the Super Amoled stuff like the Samsung's S or Note lineups, but it's still get that right amount of brightness and color. I can imagine that this phone that you can still use this for more than 2 years. The reason? Pure Google. Whenever Google is going to release new versions of Android, this phone is the first to get updates of it - take Jellybean as an example.Overall, its a great phone!

I have had almost zero problems with it and it is so easy to use and so fast and powerful. I bought it unlocked and unsubsidized at NewEgg in early February. The price being offered here at Amazon($490) is a lot less than what it was priced at at that time ($619), so I'd say go for it!When you buy your phone unsubsidized, you can get a cheaper monthly plan. Also, you don't get a bunch of cell phone carrier spam on your phone. I'm using it under the \"Unlimited - Plus\" option of T-Mobile's  \"500 Minute Value--Talk + Text\" plan. It costs me $50/month for 500 minutes talk, unlimited texting, and 2GB/month of fast broadband. When you buy your phone unlocked, you can use a cheaper SIM card when you travel abroad and not pay expensive roaming charges.This phone is sleek, easy to use, trouble free, fast, slick. The screen is beautiful. I haven't measured the battery life, but it hasn't been a problem for me so far. Contrary to what one reviewer says here, Google has already updated my phone OS once. And I've twice received a bunch of app updates. All of these updates were fast, painless and trouble-free.The phone comes with a whole raft of very useful and well-functioning apps such as Navigation (turn-by-turn directions to your destination), Google Maps, Google Search, You Tube, Gallery (a photo sharing app that automatically synchs on the Web), a contacts directory that is integrated with phone and messaging, text messaging and instant messaging, a voice dialer, etc. ad infinitum.

I've had this phone three months and it's already failing. I'm switching back to my iPhone tomorrow, and I don't even care how badly cracked it is, I miss it. I had to bring this phone in because it wouldn't connect to any chargers, and now, a new problem, It will continuously go through the process of shutting off and immediately turning off and turning on again and turning off, etc.. If you drop this phone just once, it will crack, and the style of the phone looks bad, also good luck finding a case for this phone. There are probably about 4 cases on amazon for it, and none of my liking.

Best thing is that since this is a Google GED device, it will ALWAYS get upgraded to the next OS before everyone else. Don't bother getting a carrier phone.

I'll explain in a moment. I bought the phone (the GSM version) because I was looking for a pure Android experience. I wanted the OS minus the wrappers and such added by carriers, and manufacturers. This phone delivers in that department. No phone I've owned surpasses the beauty of this phone. From the physical build to the smooth interface of ICS (& JB). The experience is incredible and I thought for sure I had found the perfect device, but it quickly turned south when I began to use the phone for, well, a phone.MINUSESThis is where the positive parts of my review end. I always read reviews, and heavily research things before I purchase them. Typically, I will listen to my gut and do what I think is best based on the opinion of other individuals and professional reviews, but this time I was totally star struck by ICS, and Jelly Bean, and the \"pure Google experience\". I purchased this phone to replace the Galaxy S2 (GSM Ver), which I loved. Great phone, but I was ready to make a move. Anyway, I noticed the day I fired up the GN that I was in trouble. The signal was below that of my wife's SkyRocket and the SGS2. Not only were the bars fewer, but the actual dbm reading was less. I live in a rural area in southern Arkansas, so AT&T; coverage is mediocre at best in many parts of my area. It's fine in town, but not so much when between the 'larger' towns.I'm beginning to travel regionally more now for work so I decided to pick up the Verizon version of the GN to try out. Verizon's footprint in the area is great, even offering 4G. I thought for sure that the GN on Verizon would be the ticket. So, a friend and I went to a job site together (I work in IT) via a rural state road. He had a Droid Bionic and I was sporting the LTE Galaxy Nexus (and still had the AT&T; version as well). During the 1.25hr drive the Droid Bionic got consistently -20dbm better signal (IE, I had -115dBm and he had -95dBm). This was the case on both 3G & 4G towers. It difference was incredible. The Bionic lost signal a few times during the trip, while both versions of Nexi were without signal 90% of the time through the rough patches.CONCLUSIONIf call quality, and signal isn't important to you, I can not recommend this phone to you. I'm very disappointed as I really wanted to like this phone. I turned in the Verizon GN for a Droid RAZR Maxx, which I have used for one day and love it. I drove the same stretch of road and was able to make phone calls, and pulled down a few songs over the 3G network while I was on the drive.

It's usually fast enough for all my apps, and the face-recognition based screen unlock is cool.I'm not going into detail about what's good because lots of things are good and it's the best phone I've had, but there are two pain points.Pain 1: This is an Android problem, not so much of a problem with this phone per se. After you put the phone to sleep with the 'power' button, and soon turn it 'on', you still need to unlock if you have locking enabled. There is no such thing as a grace period.Pain 2: File transfer between this phone and a Linux machine is near-impossible over the USB cable. This is because they decided to use MTP for file transfer instead of mounting the phone storage as a USB storage device like many older phones do. As a result, it's a pain to transfer music to this phone.

Now, dark colours save on battery life fi you have an AMOLED screen, so my complaint is not about the darkness per se, but the overall feel and colour combination. I'm not sure I like the new Roboto font either, there's something inconsistent about it.Despite a few negative comments, I would love the phone if it wasn't for the anemic battery they've put in it.

My husband has the same phone and has to do this too. It's apparently a known problem. Also, most of the time I cannot search for anything on Google.......on my Google based phone. Seriously??? I get something like \"Google connection can't be made at this time\" or something similar. I also have that same trouble with Google maps. I have to use a different map app.....on my Google phone.....The charging spot is on the bottom of the phone. I thought I'd like that but I've gone through so many charging cords that I've lost track now. The cord has to bend more at the base of the phone. Also, since it's on the bottom, it tends to get crud in it easier. You can clean it out with an eraser as I found out at my Sprint store. Happens a lot. But now I have a whole bunch of cracking in my ear. Do you put your phone in the cupholder of your car? Is there maybe some soda residue? I guess I have some because somehow it made it inside that connector area - right where the microphone is. I'm not sure how that makes it crackle in my ear, but that's what they're telling me at the Sprint store. So now I have to pay $100 to replace this just to get a refurb model of this same piece of junk (I have the insurance. They give you refurbs if you don't know already). I can't get a new phone for another 6 months. Apparently the whole soda in the connector thing happens a lot too.Then there are the other fun things with the phone - not a very good camera (my kids' HTC Ones are so much better!), so slloooowwww to do anything that requires data service but my personal favorite is the battery life. I am religious about closing apps. I still have to fully charge this phone at least twice per day. I don't run movies or even music on it.

All things I expect to be present like seamless backups (and restores), multicalendar sync, sensible defaults are just not there. Occasional UI stuttering is still there too, as are random hangs and reboots.More advanced things like full disk encryption are also pretty bad and it looks like nobody actually tested how they really work (reboot into a blank screen and you need to press power button to get to the \"enter password\" prompt, really? No way to have separate encryption and unlock passwords).Physical appearance is also questionable. Power is on the side and is pretty sensitive as are the volume buttons, so it's all too easy accidentally pressing them in the middle of something. No hardware mute button is really inconvenient when you need to fast and covertly turn off sound (e.g. at customs area at an airport where otherwise they might easily confiscate your phone if you are caught \"using\" it). Headphone jack at the bottom of the device means if you store your phone in a front shirt pocket, it must be upside-down when you listen to music on it (or even just talk).No separate memory for volume levels with and without headphone attached means you can accidentally deafen yourself if you forget to reduce the volume after connecting a headphone.Of course all of the above are not total show-stopper and the phone is still usable, it's also a clear step up from previous Android versions, but the price being charged for this is totally unjustifiable.

The stock battery Samsung provides with this phone is horrible. If you take it off the charger at 100% and run a few background apps (e.g. Facebook, Groupon, etc..) and like to leave Bluetooth on, you will get at best four to five hours out of this device.  That's accounting for the average pick up and check Email, Facebook and send the occasional text message.  That's not counting should you want to stream video or do something crazy like that (expect 2-3 hours of life from100% charge if you do). While that was acceptable several years ago, it's not any more. Not good enough at all! Not even good enough to be on the market to be frank, because without being able to be charged by USB somewhere (this phone's life support) you can't make it though half a work day, much less an entire day. By that standard alone, it should get less than two stars because it renders it (like so many Android phones) unpractical.If you have an active lifestyle the battery on this phone will enrange you and likely family members wanting to get in touch with you. You will find it dying often and you will come to dislike Samsung for it's engineering choices here. The thing to remember is this was the horrific standard a few years ago and things are tremendously better now in the power savings department with newer phones. The Galaxy Nexus will hold a unique place in mobile history, but this phone is already a relic.If you're the kind of phone user who doesn't mind 4-5 hours of battery life or the kind of user who loves to tweak their phone for optimal power consumption. Then the Galaxy Nexus might be worth considering, however it has one other major flaw and that is Android 4.2.1.

I have always preferred the flexibility of Android and its open source nature over more stringent ecosystems like the iPhone. I dislike custom overlays that companies like Samsung and HTC place on their phones due to the fact that they delay major updates to Android by several months. This is unacceptable to me. My first Android phone was the Samsung Moment and I never want to experience the horror of a carrier branded Android phone that does not receive updates ever again.So when I accidentally placed my Nexus S in a washing machine there was only one option for me. I purchased an unlocked GSM Galaxy Nexus from Google Play and popped in my T-Mobile SIM card and everything was perfect. The phone is fast enough for me (not quad-core Exynos or blazing-fast Snapdragon S4), and there is nothing quite like running the newest version of Android without having had to resort to hackery. It's very pleasant.Two days ago, my love affair with my month-old phone ended.The phone sometimes refuses to charge. Yesterday I plugged it into the wall (with the original charger, by the way) and returned three hours later to find that it had not been charging at all. Luckily I found that I can reliably charge the phone by plugging it into the USB port of my laptop. However, when the phone is not plugged into the laptop or wall, it thinks it is charging. Not only that, it acts as if it is being plugged in and out repeatedly, every few seconds. Because of this, the phone's screen never times out. It is always on, always. Because of this, the battery depletes very quickly, even with the screen brightness all the way down.My first Samsung Android phone (Moment) stopped working when it stopped making or receiving phone calls and the Wi-Fi was permanently disabled with an \"update\".My second Samsung Android phone (Nexus S) stopped working when I placed it in the washer, but before that the USB storage had failed. So I could not move pictures or video or anything to or from my computer.My third and newest Samsung Android phone (Galaxy Nexus) refuses to charge at times and refuses to go into idle mode, draining the battery and making the phone unusable because as I just stated, it refuses to charge at times.I loved Android, I always have. But I think I have gotten to the point where it's just not worth it anymore. The bugs, the faulty hardware, the unbelievably delayed updates (although I have to admit I haven't suffered from that for quite a while) all ruin a great operating system. I will probably buy whatever new iPhone Apple comes up with next.If you do decide to get this phone, good luck. If it doesn't have battery problems, you will enjoy it thoroughly as I did for the month that it worked perfectly.

Signal strength on AT&T; is consistently 6-22dB less than an iPhone 4S, and that's when the phone hasn't lost track of the closest tower (rebooting the phone will often take it from 0-1 bars to 4-5, which means that it's also chewing through battery life by not connecting to the strongest tower). The earpiece doesn't get loud enough for some calls. The speaker isn't loud enough to hear notifications in the same room, much less from the next room. and it's nowhere near loud enough to use as a speakerphone, especially in the car. This is of course exacerbated by the fact that the speaker is placed on the back of the phone, so it gets further muffled when you set the phone down. Despite its low volumes, the speaker sounds tinny. Background noise cancellation is terrible. There's no ringer on/off switch, so no way to turn of the ringer without taking the phone out of your pocket and turning the screen on.The build quality is atrocious. There's a small gap between the glass and the bezel where bits of dirt get stuck. The bezel is raised above the screen on the left side (but is flush on the right) and is sharp. The power button is across from the volume rocker, instead of on top, so it's hard to hold the phone with one hand to be able to squeeze the power button without mashing the (very easily pressed) volume rocker, which leads to constant inadvertent changes in volume. The back cover is a huge pain to get attached properly. After a month, the micro-USB port is already getting loose, and sometimes won't charge without jiggling the cable (same result with multiple cables).At low brightness levels, predominantly white screens have a weird green cast, and a mottled appearance with brighter and darker patches across the screen. At all brightness levels all images are intensely oversaturated, with skin tones appearing Snooki orange. Despite the 1280x720 resolution, small text is much more legible on the smaller iPhone 4S screen (I don't know whether this is due to a better antialiasing algorithm on the iPhone or the inferior PenTile sub pixel layout on the Nexus, or both).Android 4.0 now puts crucial on-screen buttons in the top left and right corners of the screen, which means that anyone with average-size hands or below cannot use this phone with one hand, because it's simply impossible to reach the top opposite corner of the screen from a normal holding position.The camera is, simply, the worst phone camera I've seen in years.And Android 4.0, while a huge visual upgrade from prior versions of Android, is a buggy mess. Even built-in apps crash regularly (it's fun having Google Navigation -- which IMO is otherwise the best navigation system in the world, and one of the primary reasons to pick Android -- crash when you're approaching a turn), and several times the phone has, apropos of nothing, spontaneously rebooted itself. And despite the fact that Google re-engineered the system \"back\" button to be a soft-key, they didn't fix the totally unpredictable functionality. Instead, some apps now have an *additional* built-in \"back\" button at the upper left corner of the screen, iPhone-style. Aside from the aforementioned screen size issue, how did they think that would do anything other than confuse the user?I have not ever had a worse phone relative to its contemporaries.

Now you might think this is crazy talk because people like BGR and Engadget extolled the speed of the performance of this phone in their INITIAL reviews, so you might ask: how could a phone be slow when reviewers say it is fast? Well this is nothing new: everytime a new android version comes out, reviewers praise it for speed and say things like \"this beast is mad fast\" or whatever!!! BUT that's because they ACTUALLY DONT USE the phone on a day to day basis (most of them secretly use iphones); android phones are fast and smooth when you take em out of the box but a few days of use and you will see the choppiness, inconsistent responsiveness, and lag rear their ugly heads! you will see how your iphone-owning friends STILL get better wifi signal than you, STILL get better quality smoother running apps than you, STILL have a smoother and significantly faster OS than you. Pay no mind to stupid techy spec nonsense!!! dualcore quadcore shmamcore...who cares? thing is still slower than the humble iphone 3gs!! go to the store and try the phone yourself and dont let some BGR guy make your decision. go grab the galaxy nexus and play with it in the store....u will see how as soon as you actually leave the homescreen and start multitasking, the lag, unregistered taps, and choppiness begin.finally beware of android denialists and apologists: those are android fans who know android's shortcomings but they are in denial about them, and attempt to label everyone who criticizes android as an apple fanboy, kinda like the stupid people who label you antisemitic just because you are against israel's expantionistic policies.go read what Andrew Munn wrote in G+. it makes perfect sense, as the engineering student attempts to explain android's bewildering lag. off course, the android junkies went ahead and discredited the guy, some of them did so even before reading what the guy had to say.as much as i hate to admit it, as much as i hate apple's restrictions and overall class act, up to this point, Apple remains the only high tech company that can deliver on its promises of a predictable, consistent, and superior user experience. it really is a shame that no one else can do it. i'd like to see competition but man....with every new android phone or tablet failing miserably at competing with an even older apple product, you wonder if the future is gunna be a world run by apple and no one else....  at this point, i hope windows phone fills the void for a true competitor with apple. props to microsoft for making a smooth and fast running OS.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Swype not installed or available.", "Author": "Richard Culleton", "ReviewID": "R2LW9P5KK9W7JY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you are thinking of upgrading to the Samsung Galaxy Nexus think again.

I mean that with no sarcasm what-so-ever. But let me update this review so that all future opinions are as current as mine.  Understand that my original rant was out of frustration at how Google allowed the Galaxy Nexus to be made exclusive on Verizon in the US AND gave no indiction of \"if\" or \"when\" the GSM version would be available in the US.I own a Galaxy Nexus. I was about to get one a bit cheaper than what Amazon is selling it for. I've used it extensively and It is a 5* device as I mentioned in my earlier review. Is it perfect? No. But the positives far outweigh the negatives.Pros:Gorgeous screen. It's a 1280x720 screen. That's 720p Super AmoLED. Although the screen isn't the Super AmoLED+ that's in the Galaxy S II (GSII), the screen in the Galaxy Nexus is still gorgeous giving the vibrant colors (a bit over saturated for some) and rich deep blacks that Samsung has become know for.Build quality. Samsung is known for using a lot of plastics in their devices and that would still be the case here. But just the same as the GSII, it's a solid build. The Galaxy Nexus feels light, but not necessarily cheap. The back panel is smooth and textured with the body have nice curves and a thinner form factor. The device may have a 4.6 inch screen but it still feels good in the hand overall. The exception would be when you try to touch something on the far opposite side of the screen away from your thumb. Sometimes it can be awkward but not a deal breaker.Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) This is the star of this show when it's all said and done and rightly so. Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) is hands down THE best version of Android that Google has made to date. On the Galaxy Nexus, it's fast. very fast. I found myself going from swiping through launcher screens, app tray/widget panel, multitask pane to market, download, back to launcher screen very easily and very quickly. Android has been simplified in many ways that may not seem substantial at first glance, but during actual real world use, these aspects are great additions. For instance, the notification bar in Android has clearly been one of the best on a mobile device since it was introduced. But now, a quick swipe will remove specific entries in the notification bar. If you just updated 10 apps but you also received 3 emails, it's very easy to swipe away all of the downloaded app notifications leaving the emails in the notification bar for late viewing. The multitask pane which is lifted directly from Android 3.x Honeycomb works as one familiar with Android tablets would expect. Touch the multitask pane and it brings up the last 10  or so apps that you last ran. Scroll through the list, touch an app and you pick up right where you left off, nothing skips a beat. Except, now, if you swipe across an app, you can remove it from the list, exiting the app. (*with the except of apps that have background services. Those apps will have to be stopped from the application tab in \"Settings\")Another great addition is the settings button is now in the notification bar. Pull it down, touch settings and you're there. There are many other great additions to ICS that are too numerous to list here, movie studio from Honeycomb is included for editing videos taken with your mobile device, better camera software, NFC beam, Panorama software, Sound EQ as standard with a FX booster, bass boost and 3D effects, and more.Call Quality - although smart phones are great devices, at the end of the day, they're still phones. If they can't function as such, it doesn't matter what CPU/GPU/RAM or OS it runs. The Galaxy Nexus has served me well thus far. Call quality is good, if not the best and I didn't experience any dropped calls, which speaks of the device and the T-mobile service in my area. Sound from the speaker is loud as well while on speaker or listening to music but the speaker can be a bit flat at times. Setting the EQ parameters did help with this though while playing back music.Misc. Tethering is still available, wifi calling, and as mentioned many times before, this phone works on Tmobile and AT&T; 3g/4g.ConsNo micro SD card slot- This is a deal breaker for anyone that's not using cloud services. Fortunately I do, so this wasn't a negative for me. I game though OnLive on my Transformer, I watch movies through Netflix and Google Movies so I'm covered there. I listen to music through Google Music. 16GBs of storage is fine for me but there are many people that still don't use cloud services and for them, 16GBs may not be enough.Camera - I found the camera in the Galaxy Nexus to be decent. It's not terrible, but it's not as good as it should be. I hoped Google and Samsung would match or surpass the great camera that's in the GSII but alas, they did not. ALthough the shutter speeds are awesome the actual quality of the photos I've taken, even with optimal lighting always topped out at being \"good\" not \"great.\" Video fared a bit better for me. HD quality video was also good but I'd a say a bit more impressive in part because of the screen in combination with actual moving subject matter. Lighting still plays a part obviously.There are some minor bugs I've found with audio cues with the keyboard and a couple of  apps force closed more often than I would have liked but overall, these are the only cons that I've found thus far. Using the Galaxy Nexus has been a joy. It's the kind of device that Android enthusiasts can hold up to iOS5 and WP7 as to why they wouldn't switch at this point. The Galaxy Nexus is a sexy phone with a gorgeous screen that's running a truly great version of Android and yet another reason why it's still better to buy Nexus phones before any other.
