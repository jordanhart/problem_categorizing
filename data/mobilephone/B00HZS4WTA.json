I got 12 hours of steady usage out of it with data on downloaded apps and watched movies and  pictures with and listened to music on it all day.The 8GIGS of TF card installed is a huge bonus .You can save plenty of stuff there.The camera is  decent and the front camera is good enough  on skype and other video chats.The screen is crystal clear and has super viewing angle. Great resolution.The speaker is loud and clear,.The microphone works well as well. Videos played clean and no lag or hesitation.The phone comes with a really nice case include withThe 2 Batteries included in the pack is a big bonus!AM ORDERING ANOTHER ONE TODAY FOR MY SON.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to own a super smart phone without spending a fortune", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "NO GPS! but still good phone =)", "Author": "Chris Swiontek", "ReviewID": "R1C38YCFP2GZQ4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "first , let me say that i am a BIG FAN of Lightahead, and that i generally rave about all the products by this seller {They sell really good stuff ! and the best prices this side of Asia], but....with that being said:  i really wasnt impressed with this phone. its not bad ,mind you , The touch screen is very smooth and responsive./ The WIFI range is actually incredable =} 110 feet line of sight./ blutooth works great and reconized all my devices ./display is bright and has a good range of viewing angle./ has a really Unique version of android on it {its actually 2.3 running a spoof mod to look like 4.3 -nothing wrong with that really,it still installed and ran every app i downloaded from the google play store just fine}. /and the Specs aint half bad:  -Arm Cortex -A7 dual core 1ghz {not to shabby}  - Mali-400 mp graphic chip set {one of the BEST for running Console Emulators and Games}  - 854 x 480 res screen {240dbi screen density and bright}  - 256mb of system memory {decent -no lag actually with this chipset -and the system is very efficient with it-so its FAST}  - 2600 mAh 3.7v battery [comes with 2 of them actually- and there really good !  - 9 hours talk time [i left the wifi on/ used my blutooth the entire time/watched 1 movie/ listened to 2 pinkfloyd albums / and took 20 pictures with flash / checked my facebook a few times and used all day as my business line....so YES ,its got pretty good battery life =)  - 1.3mp camera on the back {tho the settings constantly say its 4mp} with a Really good Flash {took low light pictures pretty well and still pretty good in total darkness at about 6ft with flash}  - 320x240 res front camera {a little low,but was fast framerate on skype video chat over wifi}  - Record very good Video ! and the sound was very clear and fast frame rate  - Great reception and loud speaker! mike is good too- callers on the other end could hear me loud and clear.  -COMES WITH A REALLY NICE cover /case with a cutout for camera and flash on the back.  -one of the most Accurate 3-Axis Accelerometers i have ever seen in a phone!{its a KXT J2-1009 series /same as 5c iphone]  - back plate has textured pattern on it that looks great and isnt slippery in hand {good thing=)  -comes with a 8gig micro sd card already put in phone and is set up to install apps to sd {very nice}, it will actually take up to  a 32gig {i tried it and it worked fine}  -it may only be a 2G data chip...but it was still pretty quick on data using T-Mobile ,got 1.3mb down and 0.8mb up{not bad}  - Overall A very clean,thin,  and Stylish looking cell and feels very solid in hand and looks expensive.Now....here's what i didnt like about it:  this model cell is advertised as having GPS! {there is NO GPS CHIP IN THIS PHONE AT ALL} it REALLY \"erked\" me a bit !  Now,granted , i always buy at least 1 of every new phone Lightahead sells =) and if i really like it ,i buy many more , but im kinda torn on this one. its not bad , in fact its actually a pretty good cell overall, but it feels more like a  \"$85.oo phone\", than a \"$95.50 phone\" . {because its smaller than a 5\" and has no GPS CHIP], but then again...they do include a 8gig Micro sd card with it ,so i guess it balances out =)p.s. Change the \"has GPS \"part in the product description.  and ,YES , i DO like the phone =) its a keeper,and my employees gave it a solid 8 out of 10  ,so im gonna order a few more=0  -", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "\" It's not just good looking its got brains!

This was going to be her first phone and it had to meet a \"teenager's\" expectations! Well I must say, it has. She loves it and so do her friends.  It looks great and operates like one of the more expensive brands. The only thing she complained about briefly was the camera quality,  but that quickly passed over. The size is impressive and I'm happy if she's happy! We recently purchased a phone case for this phone and I'm hoping it fits. We had a little difficulty finding one that we thought would fit.

Connection is almost instant after the Simcard goes in.Works best with AT&T; and T mobile.Crystal clear call quality. Haven't has even \"ONE\" ever since I purchased it quite a while ago.Instant wifi connection with great range. Just enter the network credentials and you are all set for super fast browsing.The MTK6572 is surprisingly fast and the dual cores fully justifying their role.One of the best things about the phone is the ease with which you can paly around  the \"PLAYSTORE\" which is fully installed and operative in the device.The search in the play store is fast  easy and precise.Haven't so far had a miss on a keyword. Usually the desired app pops up at number one of the search result..Camera quality is good and pictures clear.The front camera is useful as well.The 8GIGS of storage is a boon for music and movie lovers.Screen display resolution is fairly good and watching movies and videos is fun on this cute little device.Useful information for fellow buyers:The APN settings are automatically installed in the device with both AT&T; and T mobile. Hence do not attempt to change them as they are perfect and the moment you see the signal bars go ahead and use internet and MMS with full ease.Ok this phone doesn't have 3G compatibility but believe me the internet with  edge data connection is much  faster than what I had with T mobile 4Glte in my previous Samsung galaxy s3.The leather back makes it one of the most attractive phones in the marketThis is a unique phone in the market for the price at which it is advertised.Grab it before Lightahead  launches a newer more expensive mode.In the end I must say I love this phone.Thankyou Amazon for making such great devices to its customers.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Easily one of the best androids in the market", "Author": "Jadira", "ReviewID": "R2HO1BH6AM2XCW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The MTK 6572 processor is so awesome that even though this phone is not 3g it works as well as any other 3g phone.Call quality is super.No dropping of signal or calls.MMS works fineThe touch screen is very smooth and responsive./ The WIFI range is actually super.bluetooth works great.Downloading apps is a breeze.Set up couldn\u2019t have been easier.Just insert your sim and you are good to go.Screen display is pretty and colors smooth to eyes.Overall a great value for money .A highly recommended phone.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good looking & Efficient!
