(i was using previously Galaxy note)i'm using it over 4 months now. battery is just perfect, very fast.very slim (the slimest phone)the PLUS:- the front camera of 5MP!! it's just amazing for self shooting (use HDR settings)- the design is so sexy; the ful screen capability (u can hide the bar) so you get a small dimensions phone with 4.7\" screen- very strong processor (huawei are the leaders) never freezes.- 2GB ROM - 16GB RAM just perfect- battery last for the day. with all the calls and internet stuff i do. (it has a feature of smart power plan very useful to save battery life)- u can wear gloves and use the phone!! it is just perfect in cold weather. none of any other mobiles have that feature i guess.the NEGATIVE:- don't save any number with the country code; otherwise it won't recognize the calling name.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DMUW634"}}
