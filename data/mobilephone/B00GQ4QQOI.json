I couldn't be happier. Works flawlessly. Simple to set up and use. The promotion included a 1 GB data plan card, all for $129.00. I have various Samsung products, and this phone is no exception for quality. Coverage through Verizon is great and the phone performs great. I'm sold on Samsung products. Easy function buttons and a great resolution screen. I would highly recommend it. This is my first smartphone.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for me", "Author": "AMC", "ReviewID": "R3STQ8JK2X7TKC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little phone. I refuse to get into a contract since the prices are ridiculously overpriced. 3G really isn't all that bad and I don't really notice that much of a difference from 4G. Plus, if you have wifi at home (and most establishments), why not go the pre-paid route?", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "It is a good one", "Author": "LizzieFS", "ReviewID": "RIM8KOFRQX49F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone!

Well, the connectivity is fine with Verizon in my area, the price is great; but the phone, not so great.  The acoustics are poor to say the best.  The phone often freezes temporarily when you are on line, which is annoying, and it is SLOW!  The touch pad is fine, but not great.  On the other hand, my bill went from $90/mo to $45 per month, which was really a pleasure.  I wish I could use my T-mobile phone with the Verizon service.  Should be illegal to make you buy a phone and then restrict what you can do with it, but then, that's another battle!", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "First Smartphone", "Author": "Donna Mac", "ReviewID": "RMMWIUGX7STV5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pretty good phone and I've had no problems so far. Figured a lot of things out myself. Put my mini SD card in from my other phone and transfered my pictures, also quite easy to transfer things over from computer with the micro USB cord. I refuse to get involved in a contract with any company and the Verizon prepaid plan works fine for me.So far I'm happy with this phone. The camera is a little slow, but it works okay for me. You can bluetooth contacts over from your previous phone or go to a Verizon store and take both phones and they will do it for you.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really great!", "Author": "Angela Christine Markham", "ReviewID": "R3LVTRFRHZ7G3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect condition. Works great. Awesome little phone! Verizon prepaid has limited phone options, but this one is very nice.
