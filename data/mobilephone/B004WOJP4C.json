I hate it when stores sell you products which are not consistent with what is advertised!", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice but useless", "Author": "V. Campos", "ReviewID": "R34JGRDZUTQ9XI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really like the look and feel of this unit. Sleek design, thin and a winner for the price. (now the bad). The manual tells you \"turn off wifi when not in use\" otherwise battery is drawn. I didn't buy this phone to access the internet apps, but mostly for texting features. In the last couple of weeks, the cursor moves randomly when entering text, which makes it unusable for texting, and even worst it can make you crazy when trying to type the phone password. Password system is just unreasonable. Not the most user friendly password system. so overall stay away.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "i like", "Author": "Petra", "ReviewID": "R2RXSMKN3FD00Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "englishis pretty ideal for basic functions have second phone or give it to a child their first phone. regardsespa\u00f1oles muy bonito tienes funciones basicas ideal para segundo telefono o para regalarlo a un ni\u00f1o su primer telefono. saludos", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!!", "Author": "Ian", "ReviewID": "RCURSGC6JMJZZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone turned out to be exactly as promised.
