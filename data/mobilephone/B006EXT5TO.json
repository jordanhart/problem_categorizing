I use it constantly to go online and I literally have about 50 apps that range from Facebook to GRE practice to games, etc. which were all completely free.  I have 8+ GB of music on it and still have plenty of room on it (you can put whatever microSD card in that you would like so I bought a 16 GB one for like $10). I have had this phone for a few months now and have only had 2 dropped calls and it has excellent service.  The sound is amazing whether you are watching youtube videos, taking a phone call, or listening to songs.  Plus the screen is absolutely amazing! The HD videos definitely look HD.  I have no complaints whereas my stupid Ipod touch 4gen was such a rip off. I brag about my phone all the time since I have a cheap smart phone with cheap service. Buy this phone!!! Plus you can go on the NET 10 website and sign up for an automatic monthly plan!!! So convenient!!", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great STARTER android phone", "Author": "0rvodragon", "ReviewID": "RZYARVQK9UR5Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first ever android phone, so as I am reviewing this as a regular phone (and yes, we all know that net10's customer service is quite sketchy, so I'm not reviewing that either). Now, to start off, it's small when compared to more expensive androids, but when you think about it, that's not really a downside, since you don't have a brick in your pocket (heck, it can fit in your pocket). The body itself isn't an eye-catcher, since it's an lg optimus, so they all basically look alike with just minor changes, and honestly it's a phone, not a car. You're not going to brag on how cool your phone looks (unless it's made of solid light). The good thing about this phone though, because it doesn't use the whole front of the phone as the touch screen, is that it is tough. I have dropped it several times from five feet in the air and the only thing that would pop off is the back of the case, which is usual, and it would work normally with no cracks or dents. Now, for the programming. Yes, it is slow compared to higher priced androids and it can't support the new flash player 11. Netflix isn't very good, with a good sec of lagging between when the character speaks and the words actually come out of the speaker. However, the browser is quick, even without the wi-fi, and you can use youtube. With wi-fi,everything gets an upgrade in speed, with no loading problems on youtube and browser loading instantly. Nearly all apps run quickly and efficiently, with minor loading problems. And finally, this thing has a bunch of accessories for it, and I realize that a lot of people haven't found them yet. Reason being is that this phone goes by another name. It is also called the LG optimus 2. I have a skin for my phone that fits perfectly, so don't be afraid to get the optimus 2 skin for net10 optimus net phone. Now as far as lagging problems, I have had to restart my phone once to get everything back in order, but that was just one of those times. All in all, if you just want to try out android and see what the fuss is about, give it a try. It's one of the better of the cheap android phones, better than the Samsung intercept by all means.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lg Optimus Net", "Author": "Tia", "ReviewID": "R1JLUWUZMXF7ZG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have have had this phone for 3 days and love it!

I have downloaded several apps.The phone has restarted only once and that is when I was on the web.This phone runs off the Sprint network so make sure that Sprint works where you live before you buy this phone.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Little Android - I love it!", "Author": "Jonny", "ReviewID": "R22LYNW83E0LEM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 3/5/13Well, I believe everything I said when I first got this phone but HSN had another one of their daily specials on a Galaxy Rush (M830) and I was just running out of space on this phone and since you can't send everything to the SD card, I had to delete somethings just to update existing apps. I wasn't going to replace it 10 months into it, but I was at a road block regarding internal memory. I think this is a great starter smartphone and if you don't want to use it for a lot of apps, I still recommend it.I've barely touched the internal memory (although I have plenty apps on it) and haven't figured out how to transfer my apps to the SD card; something that was an easy option with the LG L45C unit. While they have the same Droid OS, they are not entirely the same. I now have a comparison and The LG was OK as my first smartphone, but I can see the speed difference in my newer Samsung. The screen is a little bit bigger, but not by much. I wouldn't have upgraded because of that alone, it was more of using up the memoroy. In a couple of cases, I couldn't delete some text messages because I didn't have enough memory to accomplish a delete. I thought that was strange, but I had to delete an app just to delete some text threads.If you're not going to load a lot of apps, I still think this is a great little phone. Perfect for email, text, web and some apps. Oh, it works pretty good as just a phone also!------------------------------------5/3/12 This phone replaced my good ole Rugby (the one and only indestructible phone). I swore I'd never part with it but after 8 years, it was about time. I saw this on HSN and coming from a wee old flip phone (rugged as it was), I thought it was quite remarkable. Now I don't buy from the TV on impulse and this was the daily special, so I knew the ad would come around again shortly. I went on their website and checked it out there, then went hunting on the web to read up about it. The reviews were mostly favorable and the ones that weren't were issues with speed or memory; neither of which really concerned me. I watched the next hour's ad to absorb everything they said it would do. The phone was $99 and they offered a 4 payment option. On top of that, they were giving the first month free ($50 gift card). The no contract monthly service is $45, if you use your debit card with Net10. That unlimited Net10 service is for voice/text/web/411/GPS and I knew that was the only plan available for this phone (HSN is good about explaining things like that). Since I am directionally challenged, I thought the GPS alone was great and my previous AT&T; service was $45 and all I could do was make a phone call.I figured it would be difficult to learn something completely new, but I had to make the change. After I figured how to get passed the screen lock (swipe right - I know - easy), everything else was pretty self-teaching and not difficult. The little manual that comes with it is extremely basic. You have to get the full version online. I found that out by myself and it was easy to find. I love the size of it; not as big as my friends' phones that look like they have a package in their pants (no, not \"that\" package). It came with a flexible rubber skin, USB/charger and 6 free apps (GPS for off-road directions was one - good for hikers). Now, it might not be new to you, but being able to talk to my phone is pretty cool. I don't know how I ever got along without this.OK, you've all heard about Net10's customer service (or lack of it). All true. I really only called to ask a question (can I sign up online?) but the CSR started asking me a list of questions so I figured I'd just stay on with him. Prior to that, Net10's website directed me to TracPhone's site and I didn't know if I should continue because HSN said nothing about TracPhone. Anyway, the guy I talked to wasn't rude to me, but he frustrated me. Still, he got the job done. One thing he kept telling me is to turn off the phone in a while so it would reset to accept my old number. I explained the phone was already off and asked should I turn it on? He repeated himself and said just to turn the phone off. I repeated myself too and said the phone is already off. He repeated himself again and I said, \"Look, you're telling me to turn the phone off and I'm telling you I can't do that because the phone is already turned off.\" I continued, \"Now, if you want me to turn the phone off, I will have to turn it on first in order to turn it off. Is that what you want me to do?\" He said, \"The phone has to be off to accept your old number.\" I said, \"I understand that, but do you understand that my phone is already off?\" Anyway, somehow we got passed that. I don't know if it was because he was in India, or just someone that didn't quite grasp English that well. Either way, I got through the set up. I read one review that said you can't use your old number, but HSN said you could and I did and it took less than 1 hour. My AT&T; account was automatically closed. I did wait till nearly my next billing, so I wouldn't overlap service too much (didn't want to pay 2 accounts simultaneously). Also, I'm not signing up with my debit card till the day before my free month is up. If you get the free month and then use your debit/credit card, you will lose any remaining time on your free month. I would assume the same to apply if you had a prepaid card.I won't keep this one 8 years like my Rugby, but I'm already attached to it, so it will be a while. I don't need the latest and greatest, just something I can depend on. For me, it's the perfect Android and I love it!", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "New to Android, but Great phone.

Also has the text to speech, which is fun too. The internet is fast and easy to navigate.I just really love LG phones and if you are use to their other products and want a good little Android phone for $69, I think this is a great buy.

I bought it for my son for Christmas and he had a horrible time getting it set up. The phone only takes 1 payment plan...the unlimited talk, text, etc plan. There is no way to add any smaller amounts. Wish this was made known in the description but it wasnt. Net 10- customer support is less than appropriate. They were rude and hung up 3 times on my son while trying to get this phone activated. You CANNOT use your SIM card from another Net 10 phone to put in this one..........wish that was made known in the description but it wasnt. You WILL be given a new phone number.......its just too much of a hassle to go thru.There are too many bugs with this phone currently and it hasnt been all worked out yet. Even Net 10 Engineer admitted that to my son as well as stating that customer service was not trained yet on all the functions on the phone so they actually know less about it then we probably do! (Seriously, why would they put a phone out on the market and their customer service dont even know how to operate it or give suggestions). Customer service told my 19 yr old son that he didnt need to have a cell phone if he couldnt set it up properly!!! They are RUDE and HORRIBLE to deal with. It took him a day and a half to get the phone set up and it was ONLY after a Net 10 Engineer did it and it took him 2 1/2 hours to get it activated and up and running.Save your money and your time on the phone with rude customer service reps!! Buy something else........oh and this phone freezes up as stated in another persons review of this phone.

I'll have to upgrade to one that will allow me to watch movies on it.  I can do everything on youtube on this phone that I can do on my PC at home.  I love that.  Yes, it does freeze up on youtube but it does that at home too.  I watch movies on youtube to substitute for not being able to do it on hulu, netflix, etc.  I'm not supposed to be doing it at work anyway so why complain.  But I do love this phone.

So far so good. I have already noticed that I will need to charge this phone more frequently than my old basic cell phone but considering all that can be done with an Android phone I guess that is to be expected. Since it is powered by Google you are pretty much forced to set up your Google account and use your Gmail contact list.  I had to enter phone numbers into my contact list which was kind of a pain for me since I never used Google contacts for phone numbers.  I couldn't find a way to just use a simple phone list on the phone but now that it is configured it has been making calls, sending emails and IM's flawlessly.  I'm happy and am not locked in to any lengthy contracts.  This phone does exactly what it says it will do. You can use it in 3G mode or configure it to use WI-fi.

I knew she needed one that was easy to use and she needed to be able to talk back and forth to my daughter.  Because they talk so much, and my daughter loves to text now, my mom did not have a phone that was able to do that, so I knew she needed it to be able to text, and something she could move around on the phone as she is not getting any younger and she needs to be able to see the screen but also should not need some sort of diploma to be able to use it!

I just got done talking with 3 different people (all with very heavy Indian accents) and spent a total of 59 minutes getting a huge runaround.They said they would call me tomorrow to see if I was telling the truth, because they can't get into my account right now.They will call me tomorrow night, 24 hours from now and tell me what they have decided. In the meantime, I didn't have a cell today and will not have one tomorrow.BUY A NET10 PHONE AND YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!=================================================================================================I've had this cell for about 10 days and so far so good.I was nervous about the set up as I have had problems with Net10 support in the past (several years ago). I had bought a Motorola $16.00 per month phone and really loved it after initial problems. I had this plan for 2 years and had good reception everywhere I went. I don't use my cell much so 200 minutes per month were fine with me. In fact, by the time I was ready to purchase the Optimus Net I had accumulated over 600 minutes from carry over.I was unable to activate the Optimus on there Web site due to a glitch in their process and was directed to call their service number.There was 15 minutes of hold-time and then it took 5 minutes for the tech to place the order for activation. He did state that it would take up to 72 hours for my number to be transferred and the phone to be activated. My call was placed at night and the phone was working the next morning, so I was satisfied with that. In comparison, Verizon can switch cell numbers from one phone to the next immediately.As they say \"you get what you pay for\".In the last 10 days, I haven't had any deactivation problems. I just guessing, but I'm thinking that they are putting the brakes on people who are sucking up some bandwidth through deactivation. Like I said, just a thought.As for the phone. The 800 Mhz processor and 512 MB memory produce a fairly smooth experience. Web pages load reasonably fast and downloads are responsive. Web page browsing produces a small stutter effect and is not 100% smooth, but very good for a $99.00 Smart phone through Best Buy.The biggest problem for my has been the inability to find ANY accessories. I would love to find a cover or skin. They are non-existent!Net 10 is new at Smart phones and we are guinea pigs at the moment, but based upon my past experience I would have to say that I'm currently satisfied with the service I'm getting. Especially for $54.00/month for unlimited everything!For $99.00 bucks I say give it a try, but based upon the last few reviews you may want to get a new number.Hammer", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "Faydreauna", "ReviewID": "R2J00XS5BPO4F3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved this phone.

I presently use the LG 800G touchscreen phone with 4GB SD card. I am buying the Optimus Net because the LG 800 just makes you wish you would have bought an Android phone as it will \"almost\" do some of things the Android does. It's more of a \"dumbphone\" than a \"smartphone\". I thought that if I got the extra memory, which marketing leads you to believe, that I could run the Android apps. App capable doesn't mean it will run like an Android. Anyway, back to the purchase. I am seeing (albeit a bit late) reviews dogging this phone, saying it has a bad camera, small screen, cheap case, and on and on. I wanted a smartphone, but can't afford the Droids, HTC's, etc. and now I'm not sure if this is the phone for me. Maybe I should keep using the 800 and save up for a good Android. I know I could get .01 cent phones with major carriers and a two year contract, 59 to 79 dollar plans plus all the FCC fees, taxes and who really knows what those fees are, plus you have to buy data plans from 30 to 50 bucks per month! $50.00 per month unlimited is better suited for my budget, in fact, truth is - it's hard to justify fifty bucks a month, but no more.Can someone tell me if I am making a mistake buying this phone? Are the reviews comparing this phone (which used to be the top of the line with Net 10 before the LG Black) with the new Android 4.0 phones and other top of the line phones out there? Or, will this phone do basic Android stuff, like post and read Facebook, check your bank balance, credit card availability, etc. with ease. (the 800 will, but very clunky at best. Too easy to \"fat finger\" and open other things you don't want open and in your way while trying to accomplish a completely different task due to small screen and limited scrolling)I suppose this isn't a review as much as a \"blog\", but I need someone to tell me the facts about the LG Optimus Net, Please..... I have a profile on Amazon: James \"Bear\" RossonTHANKS!!!P.S. I will definitely re-post and hopefully re-word this review after I receive my new phone in order to be of some help to prospective buyers make a decision, but for now I just need more information from just ordinary buyers, like me, before I get it. Also, any tips, like setup, etc. are welcome. ***UPDATE AD OF 12/27/2012 -- No more remorse/skepticism.
