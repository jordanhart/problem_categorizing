{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great replacement for iPhone 3GS", "Author": "gante", "ReviewID": "R1L0WWEG78A7WK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had been using an iPhone 3GS for a few years (and have been an AT&T; customer in general for years before that) when I started to realize just how much I was paying for AT&T;'s service but how little I was using it, or the talk minutes part of it anyway. I had thousands of roll over minutes and hundreds expiring every month. I no longer felt I was getting any value from their service. I looked around to try and find some savings and realized that by buying my phone up front and bringing it to T-mobile, I could be saving $20 per month. The phone does pay for itself eventually.So anyway - I am supposed to be reviewing this phone. I have been curious about the WP7 phones for a while and was happy to finally make the jump. The phone itself is attractive enough and the additional software provided by Nokia makes their handsets even better than the other WP7 phones out there. The Drive GPS app is much more than I expected from preinstalled software. It has day/night mode, a good selection of voices, and speed alerts. Plus the maps are downloaded to the phone so you never have to wait for them to load.The hubs and live tiles concept takes a while to get used to, but now that I have adapted, I wondered how I lived without them. Hubs make the folders in iOS seem useless in comparison. And live tiles are like notifications that display on the individual tile. It is a very cool concept and well executed.I never thought I would use the FM radio, but the park where I go to walk has poor coverage by T-Mobile and I was not able to stream internet music there. I just switched to the radio and found an appropriate station with good reception. It worked fantastic.Also, the phone came with a pretty good pair of headphones, which don't seem to be included when purchasing from T-Mobile.There are few negative points to this phone: It is an international phone, so I was disappointed to find that the wall charger I got was the European standard and was worthless to me. However I was able to attach the cable to the USB wall plug that came with the iPhone and charge that way. Charging seems to be a little slow using USB, but I have ordered a proper wall adapter and hopefully that will remedy the slow charging.Also, the volume when listening to audio on the phone is good but not great. Although songs which have been downloaded through the Zune store sound much stronger than streaming audio.8GB of flash storage may not seem like enough to some people. My old 3GS had twice as much, but I never cam close to filling it. I am trying to force myself more and more into the cloud and having a smaller amount of storage helps that. I store my pictures on SkyDrive instead of on the phone and I use streaming services when possible to keep from having to download music to the phone itself. And I imagine that Microsoft will improve the cloud features of WP7 further as the platform continues to mature.Finally, apps. Before purchasing the phone, I had scoured the Marketplace looking for WP7 equivalents to my iPhone apps. I was not able to find everything, but in most cases I was able to find an equivalent that worked just as well. Some of the apps lack a few of the features of their iOS counterparts, but they seem to be updated on a regular basis and forum posts show a commitment to creating equal features across all platforms.So in the end, I am happy with the phone. It is not a perfect phone, but it is a huge improvement, both in the hardware and software, over my old iPhone.IMPORTANT NOTE: I became aware after using this phone for a while that it does not work with T-Mobiles 3G/4G network. I blamed T-Mobile till I realize that their high speed data requires a phone which operates at both the 1700 MHz and 2100 MHz frequencies. This phone can't use the 1700 MHz band. While the phone still does voice, text, and (very slow) 2G (EDGE, GPRS)on the T-Mobile network, you cannot take advantage of the high speed mobile data. Had I researched this in advance, I could have saved myself some money and both myself and the seller the hassle of returning the phone. I am not bad mouthing the phone or the seller at all. The frequencies it operates at are listed in the product description. I just did not do enough homework and was operating on assumptions when I made the purchase. I am sure it works in Europe and maybe even other mobile carriers in the US, but not T-Mobile. I still have this same phone, but have returned this purchase and bought one directly from T-Mobile.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Windows Phone rocks!", "Author": "PTY User", "ReviewID": "R3VDNTOIAC9SPX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you need a phone to place calls, receive/send emails and want FB, Twitter, etc, updates in a second, then Windows Phone 7.5 is the OS for you.

I was impressed immediately by how smoothly the phone operated. Opening apps or exploring the phone is quick and easy, and the tiles interface is visually useful and easy to learn. This phone integrated completely with my facebook & twitter accounts and was remarkably efficient. When a contact was duplicated it was easy to merge the data so the same person's name didn't come up multiple times. The phone also used wireless well, and seemed fast on 4g. The camera was fine, it seemed a little blurry at times but I didn't test it much. It was also easy for me to find a flashlight app which is essential for me.With all those positives, I eventually discovered that the negatives were \"deal-breakers\" for me, and so I returned the phone and got an android 2.3 phone instead. Here are the negatives for the Lumia 710: The bluetooth is barely functional. It apparently pairs with devices like earpieces without a problem, but I don't use those. I use bluetooth to make quick file transfers between phones and laptops, and Windows phone doesn't support this action at this time. My old Nokia E63 could do this just fine (Symbian OS) so I was kind of baffled that Microsoft dropped the ball here. The Lumia 710 has no expandable storage so I had nowhere to use my little 8gb mini-sd card. While I should have done more careful research, the sales tech at T-Mobile told me it would take my mini-sd card. What he MEANT was that the Lumia 710 used a mini SIM card. I hadn't bought any of my mp3s through the Zune ecosystem so I couldn't get the phone to play my mp3s. While this might have been user error, it certainly wasn't functional enough for me! I managed to get a mp3 on the phone but then couldn't use it as a ring-tone either, which was mildly annoying.So, in conclusion, the Lumia 710 did lots of stuff well, and my wife ended up getting one. For me though, with it not doing mp3s well and not doing bluetooth well and not having expandable memory meant it just didn't do the stuff I need my cell phone to do. What's worse is that, after seeing how smooth everything runs on Windows phone, my android phone is just clunky. It's a mytouch Q (LG, android 2.3) and it has crashed a couple of times, and opens some apps slowly. I would pick Windows phone every time over android if it would just do everything that people need phones to do!", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast, Quality, and Get Things Done", "Author": "Harrison Lee \"newbharry\"", "ReviewID": "R2MRYRKLDP6BKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone 1 month ago.Pros: Great feel in the hand. It sure feels different than all the other phones I've ever had. All my friends said that it gives a higher class and comfortable feeling when held in hand.Very fast when opening applications and doing day to day work. Seriously, you don't need the a billion apps on Applestore. Most apps a person use is probably 20 apps.

Nokia clearly demonstrated this with this phone.I switched from using an Android phone (HTC Sensation), and iPhone, I realized that this is the phone I will use from day to day.

I have been a fan of the Windows Phone OS now for about a year (I owned a Samsung Focus before) and this phone optimizes it's potential. The True-Black screen is easily visible in the sun (almost as much as an AMOLED) and has great color (much better than the iPhone 4 or 4S). The Windows Phone OS is right on par with iOS (and will probably surpass it with the WP8 release) and far surpasses the juvenile Android OS. For those wondering, I have had an iOS device and several Android devices, even the Nexus S on ICS. As for the PHONE part of this device, it has more clear voice calls and better reception than any phone I've had, though that is not surprising with Nokia. The only reason that I give the camera and battery a 9 rather than 10 is because the camera is only 5MP (what you would expect from a mid-range phone) and the battery is only 1300 mAh, which is still plenty to get me through a full day with pretty heavy usage.

However, there were issues I did not anticipate.  I will start with the positive and then go with the negative.Pros:Product arrived a day earlier than expected using Amazon free shipping.Handset was a good size and weight for a smartphone.Pictures were excellent.  (I am not able to rate the video quality because I did not use this feature.Touch screen was pretty cool and allowed you to rearrange tiles on start screen pretty easily.Price point for features available for this phone were excellent.Cons:Product arrived in a box that had no Nokia logo.  This made me a little uncomfortable because the product was advertised as new.  (in fairnes to seller--the product appeared new and had no defects--but there were other issues that make me skeptical.)Phone came with a phone charger--but it did not have a USB cable, headphones, or a User Manual.  To this day--I am not sure if the Nokia Lumia 710 comes with these accessories or not--because there was no manual included and the box did not appear to be the original packaging box.The ring level was very low--even when I turned it all the way up, which made it difficult to hear when the TV or Radio was on.The speaker option was awful!  I tried calling T-Mobile several times using the speaker phone and the audio was choppy and garbled.Another issue--this maybe just me--but when the phone was dormant, you needed to push the \"On\" button on the top of the phone to turn on the screen instead of the three buttons on the bottom of the phone.  There maybe a way to change this feature to allow the lower buttons to activate the phone from its dormant state--but I couldn't figure it out.Finally--I was aware of this --and it did not affect my decision but it may influence yours--the apps store for windows is not as robust as apples or androids.  this was not a deal breaker for me--i use a limited number of apps and they were available on this phone--but if you like apps--you may want to consider something else.***In short--the low ring level and inaudible speaker-phone feature were dealbreakers for me.  I returned the phone this morning using Amazon's returns system--which is pretty easy to use.  I wound up buying an Iphone 4--I am embarrased to say--because I think Apple products are seriously overpriced--but I was looking for a solid, dependable, no-nonsense work phone and the Nokia Lumia 710 just wasn't it.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "First Impressions: Excellent!", "Author": "AncientAstronaut", "ReviewID": "RL3N8PKMZHOA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a phone that costs less than $200 including shipping, it's excellent! I got the phone only today, and I may change my opinion later if need be, but if it functions normally, I'm most likely to be very happy with the purchase. So here are the reasons why I love the phone already:-- For the price, the phone looks great \u2014 almost as good as any other phone out there! It's great to hold and show off. I was expecting it to look cheap, but it doesn't. I'm glad I got it in black.-- The user interface design is impressive. Microsoft has clearly put a lot of thought into what the interface should look like, and the result is really cool.-- The touch screen is very responsive \u2014 there are no lag or crashes. Apps works great.-- And, like I said, it cost me less than $200 with shipping!There are three minor drawbacks too:-- The phone takes some getting used too, especially if you're used to an iPhone. The user interface \u2013 as cool as it is \u2013 is not always intuitive. You will be hunting for menus, options, and buttons that you can easily find on the iPhone. But once you get used to it, it's not a big deal.-- If you love apps, this phone supports a very limited number of them. Given that it hosts Windows 7.5, which is now outdated, there's little hope that it will get a whole lot of apps in the future. But it serves the purposes I bought it for: email, facebook, youtube, and web surfing. So it works for me.-- The camera, although 5 mpx, is not the best in the world.

Also, if I update a contact, I really need to open and update BOTH contacts or else I have two sets of data that don't match.Set up a meeting in your calendar?  Well, do you want to know about it on your phone?  Then you use one calendar but if you want to keep track of who accepted invites, etc. that is a different calendar. So you have to remember to copy paste it into the other calendar.I was told it would sync with Outlook but there is no real connection to the computer like the Palm or Blackberries did. I made CERTAIN that it would sync but apparently the sales people have no idea what sync means.  You have to use the \"cloud\". The more sophisticated the phones become the less true functionality they have.  They have more games and more music but less PHONE use.Also, this phone sometimes loses its mind and won't accept calls.  Sends them to voice mail even if you are right here at the phone waiting for a call.  You sometimes get a quick vibrate but sometimes it just goes to voice mail.  On some bizarre moments it vibrates, shows a missed call and then RINGS with the call.  All unbeknownst to the caller who only knows it has been ringing 5 or 6 times before you answered.To reset the phone when it develops this bizarre behavior you have to save your info with ZUNE so you can reset the phone.

My review is for a Nokia Lumia 710 that I purchased from my Network Provider, Wind - in other words, my phone was locked when I got it. Also, I've moved on to another phone as I recently fell victim to the Android temptation.Now, that I've got that out of the way, allow me to provide my thoughts on this phone.It's a solid Nokia phone with a very stable Microsoft Windows OS.The design is simple, yet moves away from all the \"minimalist\" designs being tossed around the market today. Very portable and compact. This was a big plus for me as I could easily carry it in my vest pocket at work. The screen's very clear and getting used to the button positioning wasn't too much of a task.The only flaw in the design is that the back plate comes off too easily if the phone isn't in a fitted plastic/rubber/silicon case. As for drops, the only thing I've noticed after the dozens of drops on hard floors are small chips on the side.In regards to the phone's functionality, it runs a solid version of Microsoft's Windows OS. I've used Android before and have used the iOS on my sister's devices, and when compared with the 2, the Windows OS just slices them like a sharp blade. I've rarely experienced lags or freezes (maybe 4 times altogether in the 16 month period that I've owned this). Everything in the phone's \"start\" menu (if you'd like to call it that) is pretty straight forward and you will not find yourself on a quest, hunting down whatever it is that you're searching for.This little phone delivers good performance as well and wait times aren't going to be unbearable by any means. Excellent response time and smooth transitions for the most part. Internet runs well too (unless you're in a zone with no 3/4G or Wi-fi - DOH!). I'm not too familiar with Apple products' batteries, but Android batteries drain way too quick (even with power-management). This phone's battery isn't that great but within the 16 month period that I've had this phone, not once have I relied on a battery management app to save my battery. Also, with the Lumia 710, I've never been frightened by any over-heating issues (unlike my Android phone which was boiling on the 3rd day).The 5MP camera on the phone doesn't pack all that much power but it isn't utterly dreadful either. I've taken a few pictures and no matter the weather conditions, the pics have always turned out decent enough to be posted on social networking sites.So, where does this phone take the fall? Apps & Plug-In support. There aren't many apps readily for this phone. In today's age, apps and cellphone gaming are a big deal whether it's for showing off, acquiring a useful and necessary daily tool, or to conquer boredom at work. How long can one play simple puzzle or word games for? What does one do when there's nothing to do at work? How does one live without Youtube? That's right. No Youtube. Going onto YT's website brings up a big black box where the video should've been and it reads something along the lines of \"Please go to Adobe's website and get yourself a Flash player\". For a while, Flash did work. Then, it magically disappeared. After switching over to Android, I've noticed an immense boost up in Apps and can now kill time at work. You can still run Youtube by downloading an app, but I find it ridiculous to get a 3rd party app to watch a video on the largest Video sharing website.While I have nothing against Microsoft (in fact, I love both Microsoft & Nokia), Nokia pairing up with them was a big mistake. They should've gone for Android. Pairing up with Microsoft was what ran Nokia in to the ground (as if being slow to get in on the OS wars wasn't bad enough).All in all, if you're looking for a phone with a good build and portability, a phone with a good Operating System, a phone that can access the internet and make/receive calls & send/receive text messages, you will not be disappointed with the Nokia Lumia 710. If apps and such are your thing, this will be a poor match for you.EDIT***I forgot to give points.Design  - 8Performance  - 8Features  - A generous 5", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Windows phone no good !!", "Author": "Texan", "ReviewID": "R3J21EZQ2J6NLR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My Computer can recognize the phone, cant sync and download songs or videos for my sun to it.

Gronowski", "ReviewID": "R2MBMG11B50DKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this phone for almost a year now and am extremely happy with it. For the price, it is a great value. My friends all use Android phones that cost similar to this one, and in most ways this  phone is better. The camera, while it isn't great, can take some pretty nice photos better than a cheap Android phone. I am a fan of the Windows OS. Some of the features that I like are: a dedicated search button that lets you search by text, voice, or use the camera to scan bar or qr codes. It's nice that this is built in and you can do this by pressing one button. I also like the built in Microsoft word and the Nokia Music, which lets you listen to music for free. It works kind of like the radio, but you can skip songs that you don't like. Complaints are minor: I like the build in BIng search less than Google, there are less apps available than with Android or the iPhone, and the emoticons are much worse than on Android. But the emoticons are the only major complaint I have about this phone. Otherwise, I am very happy. I'd like to save the best feature for last: the GPS. It is amazing. My friends with Android phones tried using their GPS (they don't have data) only to get error messages. My phone started giving directions with no problem even though it wasn't connected to the Internet. That's right, the GPS works offline; you don't have to worry about high data or roaming costs using the GPS like other phones. The price of this phone is very good; it's worth buying for the GPS alone. So I highly recommend buying it. Warning about buying this phone from Amazon: It came with a European charger and adapter, and when I plugged it in, sparks came out and it didn't work. So you'll have to buy your own charger, but it only costs a few dollars.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone but wrong headphones!", "Author": "kkak52", "ReviewID": "R1TPKEBMQHLSJL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Awesome phone, no doubt.

The calander view is very simple yet detailed and my unlock screen will show my next scheduled item.  I know other phones have apps to do as much, but rather than having a cluster of apps for each thing and scrolling pages to find the right app, Windows has less apps that combine tasks and accomplish the same thing for less space.On a bonus note, a lot of games for this phone work with xbox live and give you achievements.

The way to change songs looks awful comparing to the song switching methods of my Blackberry Torch, plus Torch has a Stop button.Also, with the Torch, if I press the volume keys a bit hard, I can switch songs from there.Ring-tone is 40 seconds? Symbian allowed the full song to be the ring-tone, this needs to be fixed.Windows 7.8 might bring 8-like features, but they are opting for a Ring-tone maker to fulfill the 40 second limit, which is a disappointment, but hopefully they do listen to the users complaining on their UserVoice site.

All I needed was a phone to replace a flip phone that I had that was slow on web browsing.I bought this phone and it has a nice resolution lcd, but it's the little things that make it not worth keeping.First of all my cheaper flip phone could set any ringtone I wanted from any sound file. This device won't do it unless you manually cut a ringtone in pc zune software. Who has time for that if you have a lot of music you like?The battery life is terrible. I had to turn off all services, because when purchased brand new the charge would only last a day. I can understand that because it's a smart phone, but when I don't use it that much it's ridiculous.It uses data even when all services are turned off. I tell you that I looked everywhere and at every menu option to try and turn of the data flow so I could use my internet when I really need it. It's impossible. This device will run data even when you're not doing anything, and you can't turn it off. I would say that it probably runs at least 40mb of data just on stand by. What the hell is that???The on screen key pad for txt is annoying. You would think that practice makes perfect, but this thing has a tendency to input the wrong letter, either that or you need fingertips the size of pencils to get this working effectively. I have an ipod that does better.The camera sucks. Low light, bright light. Good luck with that mess. You can adjust the lighting after the fact, but why bother.Downloading apps is a pain in the ass. Why does it need an outlook account for anything?  You couldn't even transfer contacts when it initially came out.You can't really customize the tiles. There are themes but they are all solid colors and only a handful.Basically if you just want a phone that dials and gets calls, that's all it's good for.

Contents were as described with new phone in orignal packaging. Primay purpose is for WiFi & Skype, and to stay current on technology. Windows 7.5 Mango seems responsive, and has not crashed since I got the phone. It slides from screen to screen smoothly.  Phone comes with European charging adapter which for me is ok because I work overseas. USB charge cable also included, but is not a standard USB cable, so you must have the Nokia USB cable. Have seen some reports where customers have broken the USB/Charge cable connection port on their phone. I can see how this can happen if not careful when connecting the cable to the phone. This is a No Warranty phone. Not too happy with that, but hopefully it will not be a worthless brick like the early HP Ipaq I had paid $800 for years ago, which HP replaced once with another worthless brick. Lumia 710 battery lasts over 1 day with some WiFi use, but if using for several hours, then a charge will be necessary to go beyond a day. I do not have a sim in it yet, as my current sim is standard size, and the Lumia 710 only accepts the mini sim.  There is also no way to add memory. 8 GB is all you get, and so application install management, and transferring files like photos off to the laptop or desktop is required. I installed Skype and the navigation application, and it will not give me turn by turn without having WiFi or a sim with data connections.  I am disappointed in that.  Some have suggested that if I load the destination while still on WiFi, then turn by turn might work. I am overseas now so cannot really try that.  Don't need Iraq street maps. Skype voicemail feature is not supported on Mango, or not supported yet. I also installed a translation application, and compass.  Now I have just under 2 GB left of the 8 GB max memory, and have taken no pictures. Volume on the phone when doing Skype seems somewhat low.

Desai", "ReviewID": "RV8A747RVUKZC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My smartphone history:Apple iPhoneSamsung Galaxy CaptivateNokia Lumia 710The Nokia Lumia 710 is a serious downgrade from my Samsung phone.My reasons for changing phones:1) Faster download speed.  The captivate is for the AT&T; network; I moved to T-mobile, and my internet connection speeds stayed at 2G.  Which *sucked*.2) Android crashes.  A lot.  It's a great interface, but seriously, I wish it was more stable.Other than that, the Captivate is an amazing phone.  Great music/video player.  Great contact/calendar/to do list.  A lot of apps are available for it.  And, oh yeah, the screen is AMAZING.  Blows the iPhone out of the water.  The Nokia is a dinky little toy compared to my Captivate.Why the Nokia Lumia 710 sucks and makes me want my 2G Captivate back:1) (First side note) You will need a micro SD card for this.  My Samsung had a regular SD card.  To change phones, you have to go to a T-mobile store and get a new card.  Nokia has a micro SD card in the box with this phone.  But since the SD cards are different, it makes it difficult (if not impossible) for me to go back to my beloved Captivate.  Remember this before you make the switch.2) The screen display is terrible.  In any kind of bright light, you cannot read the screen.  Forget sunlight, this thing kaputs even in decent indoor lighting.  I can't imagine anyone being happy with the display that is not living in a fluorescent light filled home or office space.3) I hate Windows 7, Steve Wozniak's endorsement notwithstanding.  I hate that the phone automatically downloads people's gmail pictures, and shows them to you in the \"People\" tab.  Why can't you turn that off?  What if I don't want to see these people's faces?  (Do you use your phone to call people you don't want to look at on a daily basis: i.e. anyone other than a significant other or beloved family member?  Okay.  This might suck for you too.)4) There is no swype input (which is a free option on the captivate).  That keyboard is intuitive and makes typing very quick and easy.  It is similar but not the same as what Apple has on its iPhone.5) There are not enough apps for this phone.  Android had an amazing and vibrant marketplace.  This place is the restaurant deserted at lunchtime and dinnertime.  Maybe you shouldn't eat there.  It's deserted for a reason, you know.6) No customizable ringtones.  My captivate let me customize songs and voice messages as ringtones.  They had an app called Ringdroid which was the best thing ever that let me make my own ringtones.  Windows does not want to you use song clips as ringtones, or download your own ringtones, and there are no apps to make ringtones for this operating system.  Which sucks, because the default ringtones suck.7) Pictures folder.  Stupid thing shows your pictures on the folder.  So unless you want a never-ending slideshow of pictures from your pictures folder being used as a background for the pictures icon, you can't put your pictures folder on the first page to make it easily accessible.  If you take pictures on your phone for ebay purchases, paperwork, places and people you don't necessarily want to see everyday, or anything else, beware the endless slideshow of death.  And no, you cannot select which pictures appear in the slideshow.  The phone does it for you.  It's a feature, not a bug.  Like the \"People\" contact list.  Ugh.8) Fingerprints.  This phone picks up fingerprints like nothing else.  It is horrible.  My beloved Captivate had a beautiful finish which resisted fingerprints and did not get dirty and smudgy easily.  This Nokia bottom of the line crapfest does not do that.9) The volume button.  You will need to use this a lot of you want to listen to the music on your phone.  It is hard to push and set in too much on the phone.  It sucks too.10) The camera button.  This is, on the other hand, protruding too much, and is easy to press by accident.  Just holding the phone in your hand normally (as you listen to music, for example), will result in a push of the camera button.  If you use your phone as an ebook reader, you can also easily push this button.11) The default search engine is BING.  It cannot be changed to a Google default.  This sucks a lot.12) The icons are weird and not easy to understand.  I had one icon sitting on my unlock screen for three months before I realized it was for the mandatory live email address that Microsoft forces you to open so you can use this phone.13) Mandatory live account to make games (called Xbox games) and music player work.  Who uses live?  Really.  This mandatory sign up sucks too.14) There are two pages.  One is the home page with list of frequently used apps you can customize into tiles.  The second page is to the right, and is *all* of your apps.  There are no other pages.  So if need to get to the bottom of your app page, it could take a lot of scrolling.  Which sucks.15) Music player.  This SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS.  It sucks so much it deserves caps lock complaints.  You cannot make playlists on the phone.  It groups videos and music together, so if you have album covers on your music, you might not be able to tell the difference between an audio file and a video file, since it does not separate them.  It creates a visible tiled history of songs/videos/radio stations you listened to, which cannot be deleted.  Which I hate.  You have to sign up for and download microsoft zune to make the music player work.  Which sucks.  I've heard rumors of an amazingly good Nokia music player, but somehow that cannot be downloaded onto this phone.16) No world clock.  There is no clock for different locations you can put on your home page.17) No world weather.  There is no weather for different locations you can put on your home page.18) Timer/Stop watch.  There is no timer or stop watch function on this device.19) Audio quality.  Audio quality for music and telephone conversations above about halfway volume (halfway between min and max) is poor and static-filled.  As a phone, good audio quality is important.  This device fails at that.20) Product advertising.  This product is advertised as an \"introductory smartphone\".  So if you've never had a smartphone, and are upgrading from an 1980s brick, you might be really happy with this purchase.  Personally, I find being called the equivalent of a smartphone n00b very patronizing.  If my self-esteem suffered enough, I might even be forced to pick up a \"for dummies\" book, so that random writers can swear at my intelligence.  If you have ever owned or used a product called a smartphone, this phone is not for you.  Even Nokia is saying that it is not for you.  Stay away.21) Google voice does not work on this phone.  So no routing calls through your google voice.  No google voice voicemail.22) No visual voicemail.23) The advertising for the Lumia series of phones has revolved around the Nokia Lumia 900, which seems to be Nokia's flagship product for this link.  *That* phone is made with kick ass gorilla glass, which you could hammer and nail and not cause a dent.  This is not that phone.  The body is cheaply made of inferior plastic, and the screen is some inferior glass as well.  It will not be safe in your pocket with your keys, or in your purse floating free.24) Bloatware. The number of pre-installed applications which suck boggle the mind.  Delete them immediately when you get this phone.  All of them will slow down this device and drain your phone's battery.All in all, I must say, I really hate this phone and regret ever buying it.  It is incredibly poorly made, and frustrating to use.But, there are some good qualities about the phone.  Here they are:1) It has a radio.2) It does not crash as much as Android.3) For me, since I was upgrading from an AT&T; compliant 2G device, this was faster.There might be other good points.  I will let you know if I ever discover them.I wish the Samsung Note was available for T-mobile.  Such an amazing device.  I wish I had that product.  Or the Samsung Galaxy III.  Even with the crashiness of Android, it is a superior device in every way.  I made such a mistake by not making a Samsung phone my next phone.  Don't you make the same mistake as well.UPDATE: FEBRUARY 2013: WINDOWS PHONES DO NOT HAVE A CALL DURATION.  IF YOU ARE AN ATTORNEY, THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM.
