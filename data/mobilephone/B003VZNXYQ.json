It was a surprise unboxing the phone and find it included 2 batteries and a nice looking charger besides the wall charger; also 4Gb microSd card already in the phone.I was used to the capacitive screen of my iphone, this one is resistive so you need some patience some times when browsing the menus or making a selection.There are a lot of apps you can download to yur phone, the bad side is that this get saved to your phone memory, not to the SD card, so sooner or later you will end up deleting some Apps.Hope there is an firmware or software update to fix this.The phone is unlocked so you can use it in any company, Im currently using TELCEL in Mexico and everything works fine it has a very good reception, even when I cross the border to USA, still keep my signal for TELCEL, something that my iphone was not able; have not had any problem making or receiving callsThis is a good phone, I will recomend it.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ripoff - Pain in the A**", "Author": "James Nelson", "ReviewID": "R1G45333G5H0TU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone started off as really interesting for me. However it is slow. I found out that the longer it's on, the slower it gets. It also sometimes crashes too.These were the things that initially interested me: It had a nice slide-out keyboard and a touchscreen, good camera for the price and it could function as a really good iPod replacement! Sadly though, I found out that, out of the box, its calendar does not work, nor does Gmail or any other Google application. That's right - it's an Android phone that can't use the Android market.....This is because none of those applications are set up to sync with Google over wi-fi. Somehow you need to activate a data service plan with a contract, and funnily enough, T-mobile wouldn't support it with a 3G signal - ie. this phone can't use 3G. (Maybe if you live where there's a Rogers network it works better. But certainly not for T-mobile USA.)Even if you choose to root it and install OpenEtna, it's still a pain in the a**. I could finally use the market, sure, but then my camera was like on auto-fire, browsing on wi-fi was unbearably slow, and adding contacts made people awkwardly wait with me while I cursed and pressed hard on the resistive touchscreen.And if you give this to someone else they will be confused when they accidentally press the back or home key. That's right - they aren't buttons, they are \"soft-keys\", meaning you can't HOLD the phone, you let it rest in your palm. OH, and what if you press the Back button while picking up your phone? End of call. Want to find a contact while talking to someone? Oops, the phone locked itself, don't accidentally hang up!Want to type a symbol? Use the orange \"FN\" key and press space and then choose it from the menu (...every time...) - the phone I got had a set of Chinese / Korean symbols on them and the symbols on the keys were NOT the ones that came out on the screen.Anyway there are plenty of better phones for 200 bucks and LESS that will work more easily and quickly for what this phone tries to do. IF you're searching for an iPhone equivalent, DON'T GIVE UP! Just don't buy this P.O.S.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice and inexpensive", "Author": "Greystarr", "ReviewID": "RMI94GIEE6T5P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This a good starter Android Phone.

When i contacted the seller they told me that I need to contact LG directly and may be talking to a company representing LG.I called LG directly and they told me that the guarantee doesnt work outside of the original country, so they just lied to me.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "El peor Android de todos", "Author": "Delbert \"(C)PolarWorks Studio\"", "ReviewID": "RJWL1PN9ZHPV0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Este smartphone es el peor que he usado, un sistema 1.5 CupCake que da pena ya es obsoleto, si quieren una actualizaci\u00f3n a LG ser\u00e1 mejor recen, muy malo lo \u00fanico bueno es la c\u00e1mara de 5MP, y el teclado es relativamente c\u00f3modo, muy malo.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "TEST LISTING - DO NOT BUY - LG Eve GW620 Cell Phone DO NOT BUY", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nZPkGk9fL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003VZNXYQ"}}
