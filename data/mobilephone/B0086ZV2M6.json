{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone...With Limitations", "Author": "Timothy G. Parrish \"Knowlegde Pimp\"", "ReviewID": "RAJW0XAKX3ZDK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is a great product by HTC.By comparison it is compact. It's relatively smaller than most smartphones, which is the main reason I purchased it (I need to use the phone for business purposes and I didn't want to tote around a large phone that would be damaged easily or be expensive to replace). It is very well built. The housing is metal and it has withstood a few short drops on concrete floors without a scratch.There are limitations with this phone, however:1. Battery isn't easily replaced.2. The frequency bands this phone operates on are based on European bands and depending on your location you may not get 3G/4G speeds. Where I live my carrier broadcasts 3G/4G speeds on the 1900 MHz band; this phone only picks them up on the 2100MHz band. So I'm stuck with EDGE (2G) speeds in my area.3. Of the 9 sensors smartphones can be equipped with, this phone only has 4. You cannot use certain apps with this phone; like a digital compass app.4. Camera is of so-so quality. Photos taken indoors are often saturated with a yellow hue. Outdoor pictures are great.The pluses:1. Phone has a slot for a 32GB micro SIM; I no longer use my MP3 player because I can load all my music on the phone. 2100+ songs and I still have room left.2. GPS/Navigation works great and uses Google maps. Some carriers lock users into using proprietary navigation software. This one does not.3. It connects via WiFi; and will switch automatically between Wifi and cellular connection depending on what is available. So you can use Wifi only for data when you are at home, for example, and not use up your data quota imposed by your carrier.So if you are willing to compromise on some features this phone is worth it.UPDATE 4/29/14:Since this phone's release some android apps and their updates have increased greatly in size. I've begun to experience some major drawbacks when using some of these apps (specifically large apps like Google Maps, MyFitnessPal, and Facebook). There is little internal RAM left available when running these apps and the phone grinds to a halt. I've had issues with Google Maps crashing the phone when trying exit out of navigation mode. MyFitnessPal slows the phone down considerably as well and often results in a black screen when switching between screens. In addition, the screen will go black at varying times when trying to switch between apps when several are running at the same time. I don't blame the phone for this (so the 4 star rating remains), but I wanted to post a follow up since it has been about two years since I purchased the phone. As with all computing devices, newer is faster and in turn programs/apps become larger and more hungry for memory. This phone with its limited internal memory is beginning to have trouble keeping pace.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "I want to love it, but the One V has been a major disappointment", "Author": "WarmInWinter", "ReviewID": "R2JOZ8HWCXJKS6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for 10 months and for about half the time I loved it and the other half it's been a real problem.What I love most is the camera, it's very fast to focus, takes great pics outdoors and not too bad pics in good indoor light. I use it a LOT and it's the reason I want to keep this phone.Call quality has always been good. Web browsing has been adequate for what I need although a bigger screen would be nice. But screen quality and clarity is great.The downside is all the technical problems it now has. It's been in for repair twice and so far the issues are still there. The screen started to go nuts with 'phantom' finger touches, as if someone were jabbing at the screen at random moments, opening apps, closing screens, doing whatever. After two 'repairs' it now has the opposite issue, where the screen won't respond at all to any touch and I have to restart it often in the hopes it will reset enough to work for awhile before it goes catatonic again.What was really disappointing is that I got a temporary replacement One V when mine went in for repair the second time, and it did exactly the same thing, which leads me to believe that this model has some serious issues.I've been in touch with HTC and we've tried troubleshooting it. resetting HTC Sense, clearing data and running the phone in safe mode (couldn't get it to do that) and now they've escalated it and I'm hoping they are going to call me and refund my initial purchase because I just can't afford to wait longer - I've been without my phone for weeks in repair and now it's working with very limited functionality.In my opinion, it's not worth the time and hassle to keep flogging this dead horse. Which is a shame because I thought it was a great phone when it worked.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall a great phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2GRXY2FM6N3CA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this little guy. Yeah it's not the fastest or the latest and greatest but it does perform really well. I use straight talk w it and sometimes att works great. I LOVE the design just beautiful for the price point. I like this phone much better than HTC one x. The battery life is fantastic lasting all day with moderate to heavy use. Call quality is clear and loud. It's running ICS right out of the box and I can make this phone into a hot spot. Love being able to expand my memory.Cons are few. If you buy unlock expect the European charger with an adapter. The phone is a little slow since it uses a single. No front facing camera but it does have a pretty good 5 mega pixel camera. Stock keyboard is terrible but any third party app you can fix that. Don't recommend live wall paper, slows down phone.Overall I'd buy again. I purchased the htc one x because I liked this phone so much only to sell because it was to big and battery below average. If your a causal smartphone user, want your phone unlocked, solid build quality and great ui buy this phone.

It has excellent audio quality, fits easily in my pocket, and the battery lasts quite long compared to those of other smartphones in the household.  It was purchased as an unlocked phone to be used while travelling in Europe with the intent of buying a local prepaid sim in any given location.  As it stands, the phone works great with wifi and has been used to communicate via Viber and Skype over free wifi, making the local sim unnecessary.  This is the V, not the X, so it does not have a forward-facing camera for those who like to video chat.  It also does not have as much built-in memory but this is solved easily and inexpensively with a micro SD card.  Not being much of a phone person, there was a glitch in connecting to data which was solved by a gracious T-Mobile store rep who pointed out that I had not designated the APN and fixed it for me.  The unit was purchased used and described as \"like new\", which it was, down to the original box.  The vendor included a case, screen protectors, and headphones at no additional cost which was a pleasant surprise.

The iPhone 5 wasn't coming out for another month so I decided to give the Android ecosystem a try and this is the phone I chose. What a mistake. In all fairness, the phone may have been faulty as almost 50% of my calls were dropping. That alone was enough to send it back. But here are a few details about my experience with this phone...Pros:Aluminum build quality.Size was similar to iPhone 4.Cons:Phone dropped almost 50% of all calls.Sprint (Virgin Mobile) download speed in Indianapolis was about 450K vs 20MB for AT&T; or Verizon. UNACCEPTABLE.No syncing software would work with my Mac. Even Google's for Android.The music app would not use the MicroSD card to read music - useless!App's could not be stored and used on the MicroSD card. Useless!Android had a newer version out and there was no way for me to upgrade the phone.I was reading an important email, clicked a menu and right under my thumb was the \"delete account\" button which pressed by accident and wiped out all my emails from that account! - Stupid place to put that option in the interface.As a Mac user, having my contacts, calendar, email, music, photos all sync perfectly for may years with my Mac made me take it for granted. Android will sync IF you get in bed with Google and put hours into figuring out the configurations. I'm pretty tech savvy and still couldn't get it all working over a few weeks time. I'm guessing Android was made to work with PC's because there is no way this would be competitive with Apple products for Mac users.

I was against getting an iPhone, but wanted an Android that was about the same size, which fellow smartphone shoppers know is getting stupidly more difficult.I finally bought an unlocked HTC One V about a year ago. I am not a heavy user, I have barely any games and just call/text/take pictures. I don't download apps if they are unnecessary. After nearly a year of use, I need to vent my frustrations:1. The camera is awful. Every picture is WAY too bright, the white balance is all over the place. This is one of the most frustrating things considering every photo you take has these awful spots of shine that can't be corrected away with wholesale filters via photo editing software. No, I don't use my phone for professional photography - but the few times that a photo comes out clear, the light is way too sharp. The light sensor is just way too sensitive, which is a shame because it means photos are taken very quickly.2. Everything relating to Contacts Storage results in text messaging taking literally 5 minutes to open, constantly flashing back to the main messages screen when I click on a thread, and just general frustration. Forget trying to send a picture message from your gallery, the contact's name will take forever to show up. This has to do with a HTC One V software bug (a friend with an HTC One has no issue), where Contacts Storage ends up taking 50mb instead of the normal 3mb of space. But even when I synced all my contacts to Google and cleared everything, it still gives me issues. I have to close out all the programs all the time and restart the damn thing every week or so so the phone can even deal with the minimal things I'm doing.3. The processor is just generally so effing slow. I don't know what the issue is. Things will freeze randomly every once in awhile, and this is especially idiotic considering I do not use an hardcore apps at all.In short, if you use your phone for social purposes at all (calling, texting, photos, games, apps, etc.), THIS TECHNOLOGY IS PATHETIC. I paid a lot of money for this thing and did not expect something that works like it was designed in 2001.The good things:1. It looks really nice. The little bend at the bottom is unique and practical for grip, but doesn't jut out enough to get in the way. The black aluminum body has a great feel and it's just heavy enough to be sturdy. The phone itself is slim.2. Interface is easy to learn and to customize.3. Aside from the contacts-related silliness mentioned above, it works with T-Mobile fine.That's it. I HATE THIS PHONE.

Good sound quality, good camera, fast, adequate web browsing, nice design.It is small, hence hard to text with, but I can live with that.About 3 months into using this phone I started to have problems. It would freeze on me completely, or shut itself down for no apparent reason and periodically restart itself (2, 3, 4, 5 times) until it was up and running properly.The processor is extremely slow. I am not a big video game or app person, but I do enjoy the occasional bout of Subway Surfers. The phone can hardly keep up with fast game apps such as that. Uploading pictures on facebook is altogether a whole different feat.This phone can barely hold a charge. I am a student and I have classes at all hours and need a reliable phone for emergency purposes. Either the phone is dying, or is frozen. I can't get it to do anything half the time.Another issue with the phone is that it prefers to be on WiFi. Even if there is a strong mobile network signal and a faint and weak WiFi signal, it will cling onto the WiFi signal and run apps super-slow. The simple solution is to turn off the WiFi, right? Well this phone takes a good 5 minutes once the WiFi is turned off to catch the mobile network signal. And once the phone restarts, the WiFi turns on automatically.Buying this phone was a bad decision that I hope no one else makes.Even as I type up this review, the phone is sitting beside me constantly re-starting itself.If you want a good reliable Andriod phone, I would suggest a Samsung. That's what I will buy next.This phone has put me off the HTC brand forever.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "this phone is great!!!", "Author": "hi", "ReviewID": "R2NJJYRGJ2DZ14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thiis phone is one of the best phones i've had but the thing is that u have to drain the battery then charge it for four hours and thats how i messed the first one up... but now i got another one.
