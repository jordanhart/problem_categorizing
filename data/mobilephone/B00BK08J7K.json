The Samsung Galaxy S III Mini Gt-I8190 by far exceeds the phones I have previously had, and it is a joy to work with.Most importantly for me: The call quality is great; It gets 3G/H on AT&T; prepaid GoPhone where I live (in a rural basement apartment) and at work, despite being an \"international\" model (It comes with a European charger with a US adapter). My former phone, another international Samsung model did not get 3G.It is my first cell phone with dual cameras, and I love the fact that I can Skype on it. The camera/ picture quality is better than on any of my former phones, and it has a flash :) I also like the fact that it is not the biggest phone out there.All in all a great phone; very glad I got it!", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing - delivered malfunctioning device", "Author": "Zlatan Sabic", "ReviewID": "RJZ7BZX9VHQDF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My wife had the same phone, broke the screen. She was so happy with Samsung S3 Mini that she wanted the same one. But, first night the device turned itself off for no reason while charging. Next night too (connected to different charger). After two days, started turning itself off even when not charging. I checked the usual suspects - the battery has solid contact, the SIM card and SD card were not losing contact. It was simply malfunctioning.So, this phone model is really, really good, we like it a lot, but this particular seller sent us the broken phone,It's not one star only because return worked well.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Cledimar Rivero", "ReviewID": "R20JKFLD5OA0Y1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think it was just lucky to have found a good selled because I have heard and read a lot of horror stories about phones that came damaged or that were not compatible with the company that were intended to be used, so i really am thankful that my phone turned out to be perfect in every aspect. My only complaint is that I should have bought it with a lot more space because my kids keep wanting to add more and more games and it really can't fit them all.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "All was great!", "Author": "MgRgS", "ReviewID": "R2R9S6CPRND39K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like it!

I can not turn off the screen on my phone now or lock the phone, I have to wait for the screen to time-out. I contacted the seller and they won't do anything to fix it. I contacted Samsung and they said they do not have the knowledge to fix the phone because it's an international model. Definitely not worth almost $300.

I am super satisfied with the choice i made. I had an S1 fascinate and it kept lagging so i decided to get an s3 but it was too expensive. I gotta admit, i was thinking twice about ordering this phone but i decided to go with it and i'm happy with it. I can see emojis with it too, lol.

For years I have been a die-hard supporter of Nokia, however the Lumia 800 has disappointed me beyond words can describe. I couldn't afford the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini, hence the reason I chose this one. Thus far im impressed by all its features and simplicity.  My only hindrances have been that the phone has frozen on me a couple of times, causing me to do force shutdowns.

E. \"L\"", "ReviewID": "R2FPU0IZPLU9OO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recently purchased what was supposed to be a brand new phone. I noticed after I opened it that the clear protective stickers on the outside of the phone looked like they'd been reapplied. They had bubbles under them and dust. Then I noticed the seal on the outside that says \"do not accept if this seal is broken\" had another one underneath it, so clearly it had been broken and replaced once.Amazon immediately replied as they fulfilled the purchase (from the seller Top 10 Cell). They kindly offered me the options of a full return,  an exchange for a new phone at the same price, or keeping the phone at a 30% discount. I did decide to return it, as I didn't trust it at that point. Amazon was VERY helpful with this. If they hadn't fulfilled the item, I would have had to go completely through the seller for help.  The seller themselves contacted me after I left them bad feedback. They wanted to tell me that they open the phones before sending them out to be sure all of the accessories are in the box. Clearly that makes no sense for a brand new phone, for obvious reasons.My previous phone was the Galaxy SII, which I loved. I think Samsung phones are great, but beware of receiving a used phone when ordering a new one.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "Tianna tettis", "ReviewID": "RAUXF5N5VQIEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "phone works great i have tmobile only 2 small issues i had was i need a bigger sd card from my current one i had small 20$ fee and the charger could' fit my american ports", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "phone charger", "Author": "kyle mitchell", "ReviewID": "R3UIA2JISM6BFJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the charger does not work will i be able to get an replacement of the charger  if it is possible", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "Hao Li", "ReviewID": "R3DNR3ZM1AVOCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife likes it very much.

What I saw in the picture was what I received, the color, the specifications. Everything was perfect. But I had a situation. I was looking for this smartphone in amazon, and I found it, in that moment i just found one s3 mini in red and I added to my cart whit a price. When I finished to select all my products and i wanted to pay it, the cellphone was more expensive. I agree if I add it to my wish list, of course the price can changes. But I just took too few minutes to review my complete order and verify if I can buy more things. This situations makes me review all my cart and I can't buy something else. Because the product got about 10 dollars more. And I had to release another product that was on my cart previously.
