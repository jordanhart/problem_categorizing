It's big, but I got it for the size. The one frustrating thing is that because it can use a pen or pencil as a stylus, it kinda freaks out when it thinks things are touching it. This is specifically frustrating with water =(", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "ok phone", "Author": "cee jay", "ReviewID": "R3DVBYJBPADSTH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "just got this phone coz of the screen. size i have a note three . you cant compare the display part the note is so much better, knowing sony i expected a vivid screen beautiful colors i was disappointed  . but the build of the sony is great it feels good to hold i love the glass on bith sides . sony why didnt you work on a brighter display? grrrr", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Significant Technical Problems", "Author": "Eric Hofmann \"Sonthert\"", "ReviewID": "RRC85PFJP2OM9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, the phone is really, really fast. It's more advanced than the Xperia Z.The Display is BRIGHT. Its fantastic. The graphics quality is excellent.The phone also has less ringtones and other extras than the Experia Z.The Camera's performance, which is quite uncharacteristic for Sony phones is disappointing.I bought this phone and two and half months later it stopped working. Sony agreed to service it under warranty. I had to make three calls to Sony to get them to service it. I asked one of the people I talked to if they had been having lots of problems with Z Ultras and they mumbled something about The phone was so good they were getting a lot of calls about it. The second person I talked to suggested it wasn't charged completely and that I should plug it into my computer's USB to charge it. The third person I talked to admitted that they had been having lots of problems with the Z Ultra.As a prize-winning addition: The phone was described by Sony as a \"Gray Market\" phone and that it would take longer than 22 days as that it was sold in Malaysia and that they'd have to get parts from the Malaysian repair unit.So, like a sucker, I bought another Xperia Z Ultra and my wife can have the one when (if?) it comes back from Sony repair.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Massively Awesome Phone, in Purple!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R15RRJDGD59RND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This mobile works on T-Mobile US LTE bands, happily upgrades to 4.3 (when you plug it in to a PC or Mac), and all the Google services work on it!

The best part besides the size of the screen is the speed, my last phone was a Note and this rocks. The speed is unbelievable, everything snaps.It does have a few bad things,1. If you just stare at it, the screen and glass back get scratched. It's ridiculous how easy it scratches.2. I had read the camera was mediocre. It's mediocre for 2005. Disgraceful would describe it. Really poor photos. I don't miss the flash.So far can't get  push mail to work. I am not sure if it is me or the phone.I am mostly happy with my phone. Too bad for the camera.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "near perfect", "Author": "johnny nelson", "ReviewID": "R26WCP8R8797DP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing.... Enough said....
