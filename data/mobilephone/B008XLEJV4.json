The reason I gave a 2 and not 1 star was that they were willing to take back the phone and exchange it, but that is after I ship it to them, they take 24 to 48 hours to inspect the phone, and then wait for the replacement phone to get her. Not likely. I am unsatisfied and the next time they want to sell a phone with a scratch on it, I hope they explain the defect in the description. I hope that this helps.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad seller", "Author": "cesar hiraldo", "ReviewID": "R1C405CSBT28Y6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the cell was broken, which is not specific to the cell was broken with the screen raised very bad product", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its ok", "Author": "cit2011", "ReviewID": "R1VN4GG8R9RIFR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Phone was exactly what was in description, but this phone has very bad battery life!
