However, this phone has a number of unfortunate problems that make it a bad choice.1) The battery life is quite short, less than 24 if phone is not in use and even shorter if the phone is used for even one phone call. I replaced the battery and the problem remained.2) The internal memory is quite small and there a a large number of pre-loaded apps that take up most of the space. This would not be a problem if some of these apps could be transferred to a memory chip (mine was 8 GB), but they are not movable.3) The final problem is that the phone is physically fragile so it broke even with a protective case.

I'll just get a huge SD card and move everything from the phone to the card, no biggie, right?! WRONG! Most apps aren't programmed with the ability to be saved to the SD card. Why? My 13 year old cousin makes amateur apps and can easily program the app so it has the functionality to be moved to the SD card, but can the dbags  at facebook figure it out? No, apparently they can't. So I deleted facebook because my phone didn't have room for it. Why, you ask again?! Because this phone was loaded with so much bloatware right out of the box that after downloading probably 4 apps, it was full.No biggie again, right?! I'll just root it and delete everything. WRONG AGAIN! Rooting is kind of intimidating for someone with no programming experience. Also, rooting your phone will void the warranty- so you better hope you don't screw it up. My cousin could have figured out how, but didn't do it, because in his words \"even if I root it and delete everything, you'll still only have 200mb, it's not even worth it.\"When I got a smart phone I naturally assumed that it could do more than my dumb phone. I was wrong again. I had to download apps just so it would do the things my dumb phone did. The calendar is complete and absolute garbage. I click on a date and it goes to a different day. I enter an event and tell it to remind me 2 hours before, it whispers a beep or two 15 minutes before the event starts. It has no option to make it loud, like my other phone. I have to manually set my alarm for each and every event, because I can't trust the calendar app.I touch something and have to wait 30 seconds for it to respond. It\u2019s so frustrating to do anything on the internet. I rarely get my MMS messages. You can't take selfies with this camera. It only has a forward facing cam and a digital button on the LCD screen. None of the actual buttons will take a photo, so you better know exactly where the LCD button is without looking. The phone is pathetically quiet, even on speaker. I hate having phones next to my head, I feel myself getting brain cancer.Anyway, if you do get this phone, good luck.

I mean after all, it's MetroPCS.  I've had my HTC Wildfire S \"SmartPhone\" for about a month now and at first it was great because before then I had those cheapie little flip phones that didn't amount to much at all.  I liked the features and the touch screen.  One thing I learned very quickly is that this phone has NO STORAGE SPACE.  And when I say this,I mean internal storage.  You can get all the upgraded SIM Cards that you want, but it won't make a difference since you can't transfer any of the MetroPCS pre-installed apps to it (not to mention, you cannot delete any of the MetroPCS pre-installed apps from your phone unless you \"root\" it, but then that will make it go out of warranty and also you will  not be able to get any official phone updates once you do this).A suggestion for those who want to use downloaded apps such as Facebook....don't download/install the Facebook app...you can easily use Facebook through the phone's web browser and it's already setup for Facebook mobile, so that way you won't have to waste space on your phone or SIM card (yes, you can move downloaded apps to the SIM card).  Some apps are smaller in space, but you won't be able to get much, so if you frequently use Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest and so on, you won't be able to use all those apps.  You can probably have one downloaded app on your phone at a time!Another thing with this phone is that you constantly have to charge it...seriously purchase a car charger and charge it wherever you are able to, no kidding!  If you're at a friend's, ask them if you can plug your phone into their USB drive...or into an outlet...charge this thing every chance  you get because if you don't...even if you decide to take a nap, that phone is gonna die!  I took a nap for 2 hours today and woke up to a dead phone...again.  Charge it overnight!  otherwise, that alarm you set is not going to go off and you'll be late for work or school, or wherever you have to be!But my recommendation is not to get this phone, because it SUCKS and I really shoulda read reviews first on this, but oh well live and learn (facepalm...sigh).Oh and by the way, if you try to call the MetroPCS number, it doesn't go to an actual phone number for Customer Service, it goes to an app on the phone with FAQ's and that's about it.  You either have to go into the MetroPCS store where they'll tell you \"I'm sorry but we can't uninstall the MetroPCS apps\" in person, or you can get a rude Chat representative through their website who sounds like they don't want you to interrupt their solitaire game with your ridiculous questions.

I've had mine for about a year - prepaid, too - and hate it.  What do I hate about it?1) It is exceptionally slow. I have almost nothing stored on my phone other than contacts.  Nevertheless, this phone is phenomenally slow.2) Battery life.  Even with wifi turned off, battery life is abominable.  I have an iphone for work that I use constantly.  Even with frequent use, the iPhone significantly outperforms the Wildfire, even when the Wildfire is simply left on without use.3) Settings routinely turn back on.  I don't want my phone's LED to blink when I have a voicemail.  I have adjusted this setting on my Wildfire.  Nevertheless, a few hours later, it blinks if I have voicemail.  Settings' permanence is sketchy at best.4) The spellcheck is pretty bad and the words not in the dictionary are rather simple ones.

That should certainly tell you something.I spent $250 on this when I bought it for my brother (I believe last year).

My brother is constantly giving me his phone to 'fix it'. What am I fixing, you ask? This annoying popup telling him he's out of memory and can't even open a friggen text message. How basic is that?To put it into context, he has four (4) apps on his phone. He started off with ~10, but he has been steadily deleting them as his annoying \"no memory to open a damn text message\" popup started appearing.The worst part is that there is really no fix for this other than rooting the phone and moving stuff to an SD card. I'm just beyond pissed that HTC could charge $250 for this piece of crap, and not even give you a 1 GB internal memory stick or something.

In fact I'm going to buy this phone for my nice so she can have a good And relieable phone to use when she goes to collage in the fall. That's how much I like this phone. I'll probably be getting one for my nefffew when he graduates high school too.", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Small & Smart...", "Author": "Delando", "ReviewID": "R1XR7BRC4KU6EE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my phone for a month now.I am glad to have gotten it.This phone is small yes...but It carries a big stick.It has plenty of  memory both inner and SD.oh and the timeing couldn't been better.

Its is a piece of S#%T. Do not buy it. the internal memory is the smallest I've ever seen. you can't even download any more apps, because it will not let you use other apps(included text messaging) because the memory is so low. sometimes you can't even text without deleting some pics(and you can't even store that many to begin with, maybe less than 10). and you can't delete pics because the memory is so low...\"please free up some storage space before using this app\". and when texting, the keyboard REALLY lags. sometimes won't even work, forcing you to restart the phone. the camera is HORRIBLE. I don't know why other people are giving this phone good reviews, but you get what you pay for. so, take my advice and STAY AWAY.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "SUCKS", "Author": "delores", "ReviewID": "RZ0D93NNDILMY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THIS PHONE SUCKS THE MEMORY IS VERY LOW & YOU CAN'T REALLY DO MUCH ON IT WITHOUT YOUR MEMORY BEING FULL ALL THE TIME I WASTED 190 FOR KNOW REASON SMH.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "oh ya i forgot", "Author": "Trent Simas", "ReviewID": "R3QR6R1BY9MK2G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "make sure u get everything in the box. it said comes with 2gb sd card..but no sd card.i have asked if they can send it to me and no reply", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "does not work with T-mobile", "Author": "Elisa W.", "ReviewID": "R2HSGEX4963B4P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone does not work with T-mobile.
