The quality product is ok, camera is nice for the price.I had a major isssue at first because it was all on english, and even when I changed the language the phone still had some chinese feature, and NO google play store... I felt bad!, but then I downloaded a system update from the zte website and followed the instructions, my phone reseted and the phone was a whole new android phone!. I'm very happy with it now,Good specs for the apps I use (google services, outlook, skype, whatsapp, bbm, office, youtube, camera) Really recommend it for those who want a smartphone but dont want or need to spend 600$ on a samsung or so.Casual games nothing fancy but very nice product overall.EDIT:not sure if im allowed to post a link in here but here it is [...] with the download its included a pdf file with instructions on how to update the device, very easy to follow", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK cheap phone", "Author": "Steve S", "ReviewID": "R32O14SPCSSSFT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is definitely a good buy.  There are several things I wish that I had known however.  The system messages are in Chinese characters and on occasion also appear in English.  That's ok unless you need to know what the error means.  Secondly if you need handsfree dialing in the car using bluetooth, don't get this phone.  I have tried 10 or so hands free dialers from the app store and none work completely.  It does not seem to support Google Now voice recognition well at all.  The Quad Core should be faster but seems to lag a bit.  If you need dual sims though this price is ridiculously low", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not in love with it, don't hate it.", "Author": "TechieTutor83", "ReviewID": "R2994YB0M9O8F5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone because it was the only phone that had all the features I was looking for from StraightTalk. I have had it for about 3 months now.Pros:-Android 4.1.2.-5 MP rear camera with flash-1.3 MP front camera-Approx 2.5GB internal memory-Large touch screen-Runs on the verizon towers-9 home screens (why anyone needs 9 different desktops, I don't know)Cons:-No physical keyboard-No physical camera button-No physical home/back/menu buttons-Has a bug with app storageOther notes:-SD card slot is locate under the back cover, but the battery does not have to be removed to do so.-Speaker located on back of phone, so if phone is lying flat while playing music or on speaker phone, sound is muffled.Issues:-Once in a while, if I am running an app too long, or too many apps at once, it restarts.-If I \"move app to SD card\", there is a bug... for some reason it moves the app to another part of internal memory, NOT to the SD card. This isn't a big deal to me, because there is 1.5 GB of storage dedicated to this app storage. HOWEVER, if you restart the phone with the SD card in the phone, any apps that have been moved to \"SD card\" don't show up. I have to restart my phone again without the SD card, wait for the apps to populate, and then reinsert the SD card and it is fine.-The back/home/menu buttons are part of the touch screen, and the touch screen is NOT very responsive. Sometime I have to hit the back button a dozen times before it recognizes it. Also, if my hands are too warm or too cold, it freaks the screen out and I can't get the pattern lock to unlock.-To go along with the touch screen not being responsive, the camera only has an on-screen button, and since it doesn't always recognize a touch right away, I miss good candid shots. I am thinking of looking for a third-party camera app which will let me bind the camera button to the volume button.-Swype is not installed. I have tried several third-party apps, because I am too stingy to pay the 3.99 for the actual app... but I may have to break down and buy it.Overall, I like this phone. I haven't had many issues with it over the last few months. The few problems I have listed don't bother me too much... I either deal with them, or find a work around. I would probably give this a 3.5 start rating. I paid more than it's being offered for here, and I think this is a pretty decent price for the phone being offered, if you are willing to try out a new phone manufacturer.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "this phone is b,s,", "Author": "Tim H.", "ReviewID": "R5DUL7D9D5D3I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this phone would not connect to the wifi and had a lot of Chinese bloatware on it you need to tell people who are purchasing this phone that it would come to that way for rooted and delete all of it doesn't have the Play Store on garbage phone...", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "X-(", "Author": "I.

While it does have a few pros, they are, unfortunately, over-shadowed by a slew of cons. Buy at your own risk.Pros:+ Screen Size+ Price+ Looks GoodCons:-Slow; it often freezes or hangs while trying to catch up with me,-Poor call quality. People report that I sound like I'm underwater even if I have full signal.-Restarts randomly-Sometimes ringers and alerts do not work. Restarting fixes this.-Sometimes cannot adjust call volume.-Often phone dies without warning about low battery.-When researching how to root (to remove bloat), you'll find this can't be done.-This is nit-picky but I cannot dim the screen enough for use in dark rooms. The thing is blinding when used in dark even with brightness all the way down.Summary:If you buy this phone you are taking a chance. It has many issues. It feels more like an alpha or beta release than a quality control tested product.

It is cheaper than the Galaxy and works for what I need. emails, txt, facebook, apps, downfall is I can't connect to my Xbox360 using glass due to the fact the phone is not compatible. Mind you I have read a lot of negative reviews on this phone, No two phones are the same with problems some might but not all. Its a chance with any phone you buy on what is going to go wrong and what wont.
