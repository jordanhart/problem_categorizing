Impresive screen.  Wi-FI, Bluetooth, GPS, Internet all work fine. Call audio excellent, good reception. A gamer must. Easy to use and get used to. Comes with a 8GB microSD.CONS: Game controler is a little small (and I don't have big hands). Also a little heavier than other phones. But the real problem is that sometimes while calling the screen goes blank, so you don't have access to any function, then things come back to normal (so i guess it must be something in the software). Also while playing, all of a sudden the game has shut down and automaticaly gone back to the home screen. Not very frequent but should be a perfect phone of this price.17/06/2011: A software update has practiaclly fixed all the bugs. No more closing programs or problems with the phone calls.

When smart phone's first came out there was no way I was going to purchase one when my psp could do everything they could, and had quality games for it. Finally I have the best of both worlds despite what another review on amazon states. The phone works great it is loud and clear. The phone doesn't come with a really great line up of games unless your a sims fan, but it comes with perfect controls to fit all the wonderful apps. Through the android market you can find a emulator for the playstation 1, GBA, SNES, N64, ATARAI, NES, GBC, and many more. Despite the playstaion network not being on this phone through the emulators it is really easy to play all your favorite games that you already own through the emulators. I have nothing negative to say about this phone. Its not the most advanced smartphone available, but its hands down the best gaming phone available. If only the playstation Vita would double as a phone. AS ALWAYS DO NOT DOWNLOAD A ROM FOR A GAME YOU DO NOT ALREADY OWN THAT IS PIRATING.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone is Great", "Author": "sevenfinger", "ReviewID": "R15YBNPUT142Z2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had the phone for over a week now and no issues what so ever. Great phone, buttons work great and was in original packaging. The only thing that took a little bit of googleing was figuring out the difference between the types of Xperia Plays out there.The R800x is the Verizon version and only works on CDMA networks.The R800i is a GSM and CDMA international phone and will work in the states with Straight Talk, AT&T;, TMobile and probably any other provider that offers a SIM card option. Takes a Sim card and is the one that I got and it gets excellent service and I live in the boonies.The R800a is the American version of the R800i and will work with the same carriers, the only difference is the initial programs that come preloaded on the phone.I bought the R800i because it was a little cheaper and the phone came ready to use, got a Straight Talk SIM card from the Walmart website and it was simply to get service started. Put the SIM card in, registered the unlimited minute pack on there website and added the APN information as described in the installation kit that came with the card. I was making calls and sending texts withing 3 min.The games on the phone look amazing for a cell phone and the controls are a big step up from fingering the screen and getting your thumbs in the middle of your view. They just work great for gaming. The screen itself is 720p which looks awesome on a 4 inch screen and enhances all the games beyond what I am used to. Would recommend to anyone gamers or not. Great phone. WIll update if any issues occur.Hope this helped save you some time.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "A must buy !!", "Author": "Rogelio Valdez \"Role !\"", "ReviewID": "R3TM5IQIR3QMA3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even that the Samsung galaxy gets all the attention as a the best smartphone, you can't go wrong with the Xperia Play.

With an emulator this phone is amazing and GINGERBREAD is a pleasure to use on this device.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Why this device is still worthwhile:", "Author": "Max Harry Johnson", "ReviewID": "R10426CYVWGLK7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "IMPORTANT: This device is NOT compatible with 3G on AT&T; nor T-Mobile in United States. The spec of the R800\"i\" version only support the HSDPA 900 / 2100 bands, which neither AT&T; nor T-Mobile in the US support. You will only get 2G speed. The R800\"at\" AT&T; version use the  850 / 1900 / 2100 bands. The great thing about this is T-Mobile is beginning to enable support for 1900/2100 in various area, so if you manged to get an unlocked version of the R800at you can get 3G on T-Mobile if you happen to live in one of those 1900Mhz supported location.I have owned devices like the Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Nexus, I sold them and goes back to the Xperia Play because for someone who love classic console gaming there is no better choice as a phone. Bluetooth gamepads just doesn't do it for me because they're not really portable and can take time to setup.GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS DEVICE:-THE GAMEPAD: I won't have to explain this.-DURABILITY: It's quite durable and can easily withstand 'reasonable drops'. I have less concern about accidentally dropping this device than dropping highend devices with Gorilla Glass.-SOUND QUALITY: Audiophiles might realize that there are not a lot of Android phones with great sound quality. The headphone output quality is very good and to my ears comparable to the original Galaxy S which is another Android device with great sound.-aGPS and GLONASS support: This allow it to get reasonably fast location fix and stay fixed. Its not the most accurate, but for a being an older device its very acceptable and probably better than many other devices that only have aGPS.-CAMERA: For being a 5MP camera with LED flash it can take decent photos. It's about 90% as detailed as the Galaxy Nexus 5MP camera, but is better with low light situation. It can record videos at 720p with continuous autofocus. However, there is a big flaw with the camera microphone's volume being extremely quiet.The CONS:-Performance: Even at the time of release, this device have a hopelessly underpowered CPU and GPU combination and only ~400mb of usable RAM. It might not play some newer graphic intensive 3D games, however it does support many games. \"Classic gaming\" is where its at for this device.-Low brightness: The LCD display have accurate color, but is not very bright so can be hard to see under sunlight.-Will eventually get dirt underneath the screen because it's not properly sealed, unless you're a very clean and careful person.-Camera's microphone: As mentioned, the camera microphone's volume is extremely low, so recorded videos will be very quiet.-Small gamepad: Not a real con, but the gamepad of this device is a bit small so people with large hands might get cramps. I found the \"touchpad joysticks\" difficult to use.OVERALL: Even if you don't intend to use this as a phone, it makes a very good portable music and gaming device, especially if you are a fan of classic consoles. It take decent photos and have good GPS signal.Note: I killed this device by installing a \"wet-applied screen protector\", which caused the phone to short out, the digitizer stopped working and other components messing up. So I recommend to be careful with water/moisture and don't use wet screen protectors with this.Also read my comment on this review for more tips.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not for Costa rica", "Author": "jd", "ReviewID": "R3OYO2DWWSGZFR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good phone but not for gsm band 850 that work in costa rica .

So I ordered it, I got it right on time and I LOVE it.  I'm a big gamer myself and I just love this phone, it's perfect for what I need. Mainly all I ever do on my phone is call a few people, text a lot, and do some facebooking and then play games. So this phone was ideal for me. I have an Nintendo 3DS, but being a girl, it's a hasle trying to cram a wallet, keys, 3DS, phone, and \"other\" things into my purse and it not look like I'm trying to smugle something out in it, not to mention having everyting fall out when I try to get something out of my purse. So now, I have the ease of just throwing my phone in my purse and going, if I am stuck waiting somewhere, I have my gaming device with me as well. The graphics are very, very nice on this phone and I love the good solid feel it has to it, I feel like I'm actually holding something when I have it in my hand.

Gets through a day of light use but you will need an portable charger for anything more.Personal Preference: + Hardware buttons are a joy to use compared to touch capacitive buttons + Beautiful design + Thick, curved shape fits comfortably into the hand. Probably the most comfortable shape for a smartphone ever. - Too slim. This makes it difficult to hold for gaming but easier to fit in your pocket.Wrap-up:As a phone I wish the display was brighter and had a longer battery life. But I like the comfortable shape, awesome camera, and clicky hardware buttons. As a gaming device I wish the analog sticks were physical and had a dual core processor. But the slide out gamepad is a massive improvement over touchscreen controls and the beautiful screen + awesome stereo speakers make for the best portable gaming experience yet (that is, until the Vita comes out).If you're a big gamer and want a device to carry out to play android games or emulators then definitely pick this up. At the moment, nothing can even compare to this phone in terms of gaming. However, if you've yet to exhaust the Nintendo DS or PSP's massive gaming libraries and don't mind carrying around an extra device, you will want to reconsider.

In the past, I have avoided the smartphone craze because I do not talk or text all that much and I find cell phone service in the US to be  overpriced and generally underwhelming. I decided, however, to pick up this phone unlocked and it is truly terrific as an entertainment device. In fact, the ability to play high quality games with a physical control on a phone makes this the most compelling portable gaming device on the market. Discrete gaming devices may be more powerful, but most people carry a phone with them everyday, whereas there are many circumstances in which carrying a Vita or 3DS would be inappropriate. It is this seamless integration of the gaming experience into a life commodity that makes the phone unique. Yes, it does not have ICS and the touchpad thumbsticks are less than accurate, but this is a truly one of a kind device. If you love gaming, I would pick one up without hesitation before they become relics. One wonders, in light of Sony's decision not to update the phone to ICS or announce a new version, if the phone was too good. Adding a gamepad to an open and configurable operating system may well have been a choice that was too positive for the consumer.  I'll update my thoughts if there is an build quality or reliability issues.

That is because Verizon loaned him a Sony Ericsson Experia PLAY smartphone to review. Verizon wanted to see how technology like smartphones affect the lives of school children and my lucky kid was asked to be a reviewer.If you have read my blog for any amount of time, then you know that my son is a true gamer and the Sony Ericsson Experia PLAY is the only PlayStation\u00ae Certified Smartphone. That's right tech lovers, this smartphone is a also a gaming system. Instead of a slide out keyboard, this smartphone has a slide out gaming controller. And the games are stored on the phone's included SD card.The Sony Ericsson Experia PLAY is an Android based smartphone that runs the Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) operating system. It has a big 4\" screen and a fast 1Ghz processor for running lots of Sony PlayStation\u00ae games. It also has a 5 MP Camera and VGA Front Facing Camera for doing Video Chats.When my son received this smartphone in the mail, of course the first thing he did was start playing all the Playstation games. The Sony Ericsson Experia PLAY comes with a number of games pre-loaded on the 8 GB SD card including Crash Badicoot, Asphalt 6, Bruce Lee Dragon Warrior, Madden NFL 11, Star Battalion and The Sims 3. I did not allow my son to play all the games because some of them like The Sims 3 and Bruce Lee Dragon Warrior were rated for Teens. But he wizzed through all the games in no time flat and then wanted to know how to get more. More games are only a credit card away because they can be bought and downloaded online using the smartphone.Given that a smartphone can do so many great things, I wondered how my son would naturally incorporate using the Sony Ericsson Experia PLAY on his own. What I noticed was my son became more balanced and started playing the games less and started using the other functions of the smartphone more.  To my surprise, he actually started using the smartphone to help out with his school work.My son has terms that he needs to \"Google\" on a weekly basis for school and instead of using his computer, he started using the Sony Ericsson Experia PLAY browser to \"Google\" the terms for his classwork. He also downloaded a Dictionary app to the smartphone so that he could do further research for his vocabulary words.A renewed love of reading - all due to a smartphone...Another thing that shocked me is that my son started using the Sony Ericsson Experia PLAY as a Kindle eBook reader. As my son has gotten older, he has been reading less books because he thinks they are boring. When I first setup the smartphone, I initially tied it my Google email account and my Amazon account which contains my Kindle eBooks. What I noticed was my son wanted to play with all the phone's apps and then he wanted permission to read my Kindle books. That is when I realized that I had some Kindle titles that were totally not appropriate for an 11 year old to read (opps!). I also realized that because the smartphone was tied to my Amazon account, my kid could be off buying eBooks and anything else that Amazon sells (with MY credit card) without me even knowing. (What was I thinking!)So I removed my Google and Amazon accounts from the smartphone and set my son up with his own Google mail (gmail) account and his own Amazon account (with no credit card tied to it) so he could have his own separate collection of Kindle eBooks. Then I started buying him age appropriate Kindle eBooks with my Amazon account and using the Amazon \"Gift\" function to send them to his account. I also found a number of FREE Kindle eBooks like \"The Adventures of Kid Combat\". Now my son is devouring eBooks faster than I can buy them.  I never thought that a smartphone could bring back my son's love of reading.What's new Auntie?...The new Google mail (gmail) account has also encouraged my son to stay in touch with extended family members. Until using the Sony Ericsson Experia PLAY smartphone, my son has never been interested in sending email. But now, he is emailing my sister and asking how her day is going and checking in with his cousins on a regular basis. It is very easy because the smartphone is portable and he does not have to wait to use his computer to send an email.Do you know where your smartphone is?...There have been so many wonderful things that my son having a smartphone has initiated, that I hate to bring up the one downside to this experience - responsibility. Since my son is only 11 years old, he is not yet responsible enough to keep up with a smartphone.I bought my son a no contract mobile phone over a year ago and he has lost and found that phone so many times that I have lost count.  He lost it once at school and twice it was found by my neighbors in their grass. He is going to have to show me a heck of a lot more responsibility with his current mobile phone before he graduates to a contract smartphone.But it is nice to know that when he is ready, the things he can do with a smartphone like the Verizon Sony Ericsson Experia PLAY - from gaming, to school work, to reading and beyond - are endless.Disclaimer: Verizon Wireless loaned my son the Sony Ericsson Experia PLAY smartphone in order for me to write this review and state my unbiased opinion on how he interacted with the technology.

The 1st phone had camera problem.  HD Camera cannot light up from time to time.  Because that was an intermittent issue, when I sent for repair, Sony repair center returned my phone without doing anything as they cannot reproduce the probem.  Well, I totally understand they won't be able to deal with intermitten problems if they only tested once or twice.  Also, I didn't use phone camera that often, I was ok to live with that problem.A few months ago, I purchased Sony Ericsson Xperia because of its great features.  It works great in first 2 months.  Then, I noticed its sensor stop working so that my phone won't be albe to lock its screen automatically.  It is only a minor issue, I thought it should be easy to fix by their specialist.  A phone call to their support center, got a ticket number and ship the phone WITH MY OWN COST to their repair center for WARRANTY repair.After that, it all went to hell...I received my repaired phone in a couple weeks.  Guess what?  I can only turn on the phone.  That's it... nothing worked any more.  I don't know what they did to my phone.  The touch screen was completed mess up.  If I touch one spot somewhere else could be pressed or entered.  If I press 1 on the screen, number 3 or 6 will be entered accidently.  Without a functional touch screen, I cannot use that phone at all even if I want to turn it off.What can I do, I got on the phone with their custmer support.  Again, I was told I had to send back my phone once again WITH MY OWN COST...  2 weeks later, I received my phone and a notice stated \"cannot reproduce the problem\".  I called SONY's support and told them touch screen was not functional at all.  I beg them to check it carefully.  If they want, I can also bring this phone to any SONY shop to verify this problem.3nd time, I had to send my cell phone for repair WITH MY OWN COST.  And again, I got it back with \"cannot reproduce the problem\"...  Same thing happened again and again, after I sent in for 5th repair, and I finally quit.  I am not a rich guy.  I don't want throw this $500 phone away.  But, my phone is now deadly sitting on my desk.  I don't know what to do and who I should talk to.Crying....Maybe SONY built many quality products.
