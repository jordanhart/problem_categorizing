{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great, cheap phone", "Author": "T. Lawrence", "ReviewID": "R17I3O7V5VEL7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone, uses international SIM as well as local SIM cards.  The phone works well in East Africa (with local cell phone service as well as the international SIM) and in Europe (international SIM).  Though cheap, it does what it is supposed to do: make calls.  Bonus: alarm, date/time, easy read screen, easy to use, and a contact list to make calls easy.  Great travel phone.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "A good overseas travel phone", "Author": "Noel F. Heal", "ReviewID": "RGSNMTPSDSV94", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great phone for staying in touch when traveling to just about anywhere. It has a monochrome LED screen that is actually visible in bright sunlight, no camera, no video, no fancy tricks. But it is really great for making old-fashioned phone calls. All you need is a universal SIM card that works in multiple countries, and you can buy that from any of a number service companies that sell pre-paid or post-paid mobile telephone time. I bought one that lets me keep the same international phone number without a periodic charge.", "Date": "June 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "A Nightmare", "Author": "D. Brown", "ReviewID": "R144D552I9VR88", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone through a supplier via an online travel site. This phone is an absolute nightmare to navigate. Now that most of us nowadays text instead of talking, the A70 makes it absolutely near impossible to do so. The phone feels cheap. What is worse is that depending on your provider, a phone call costs 2.00 USD or 80 per text! If you are considering using a phone abroad, do not get this. A piece of junk.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good travel phone", "Author": "J. Ramey \"Bookworm\"", "ReviewID": "R1OWK1MIJ62ER8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is perfect for the frequent traveler because it doesn't cost very much (if you lose it or have it stolen you're not out of a lot of money), and buying it is way cheaper than renting the same model from a phone rental company.  All you have to do is buy a SIM card when you arrive in the country of destination.  The phone comes with a european connector with a U.S. adapter.  The one I received was blue instead of grey, but lucky for me blue is my favorite color.  I highly recommend this phone for the student or budget traveler.  I never travel out of country without mine.", "Date": "May 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "I used this phone in Western Europe back in 2010.", "Author": "G.

The phone worked well.As others have mentioned, the menu settings are not intuitive. It takes a lot getting used to navigating the phone. Overall, the phone served it's purpose. I only needed it to confirm lodging reservations. I did not use it to text.It is extremely light and feels like a toy, but it's sturdy enough. By now, it seems this phone is outdated.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works Fine", "Author": "Parker", "ReviewID": "R3234KXHYT5DHM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good cheap international phone.
