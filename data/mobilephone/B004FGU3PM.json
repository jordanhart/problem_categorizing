It is a great phone and i am going to be ordering a new one. Some people just think they can sell crap on here though. For this other guy that had bought this phone and said it sucked he probably was right for THAT exact phone. But the reason the sim was all messed up and stuff was probably because they had scratched the metal where the sim and the phone actually met and paired... I would strongly suggest this phone but not \"this this\" phone.I cant wait till my NEW matrix comes in though!!", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "100% works... very funny.", "Author": "Jordan D.", "ReviewID": "R2VWWS16IJ24YV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Okay first off I would like to say that the phone shipped very fast. That was the only good thing about this tho... When I opened the package I was expecting a slightly used looking phone. Hm. I suddenly realized that it came with no back, no protection for the battery. I thought this was odd but I thought I could be able to work around it. So I noticed some minor scratches, that was expected. I then turned the phone on, hoping to mess with it before putting the Sim Card in. It would not let me mess with the phone at all, I was curious but thought it was just part of the device or something. Later on put the Sim card in.. Nothing. Still the same warning.. \"Please Insert Sim Card\". And it still wont work. Piece of junkTo put it shortly, I was expecting a slightly used working phone, got a broken one. I am currently contacting the seller to get a refund as I send the phone back.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Keypad sucks other than that grea tphone", "Author": "Amanda", "ReviewID": "R1WQPPXH3QFTHP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "KEYPAD SUCKS!
