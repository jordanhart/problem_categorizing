{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Phones are not new or factory unlocked, but good customer service", "Author": "bizbytez \"bizbytez\"", "ReviewID": "R2SZI36Y9Z5VLY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Please be advised that these phones are not \"new\" or (Apple) \"factory\" unlocked. You will receive a phone that has been unlocked by an after-market third party, and they may actually be used.Secondly, you will receive an iPhone with a very outdated iOS (operating system) version. Even though the seller does NOT tell you this, you will NOT be able to update the phone to the latest iOS, ever. This will prevent you from making use of the latest iPhone/iTunes features, etc. It may also present a security risk. If this is not an issue for you, I guess it'd be OK.Let me say that the seller ships very promptly, and their after-sales service is excellent.But the first iPhone I received was defective, since the power button was broken (didn't have the \"chrome strip\" attached). This is another way I knew the phone wasn't new, as claimed. I was issued a returns authorization very quickly and without hassle, and after returning the phone to them, received a replacement very promptly.However, I was unable to get the replacement phone activated on AT&T; and had to return this one too. Again, I received a returns authorization quickly, as well as full refund.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Johnny \"Online Surfer\"", "ReviewID": "R1WKZFPARKSBE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this was a gift phone. the recipient loved it...can't go wrong with apple products no matter how old they are.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Educate yourself first on UNLOCKED iPhones!!!", "Author": "Ramona Sinclair", "ReviewID": "R132ZCAWAC59SW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you, like me, don't understand the difference between unlocked, factory unlocked and/or jailbroken, do yourself the favor before plunking cash down on an unlocked iPhone.  Whether new or refurbished, if you need an unlocked phone for a carrier other than AT&T;, Verizon or Sprint, it must be PERMANENTLY UNLOCKED, which means unlocked either by the manufacturer or by the carrier in the case of post-contract phones.  Unless there is proof -- or a guarantee of its permanently unlocked status, the phone is probably software unlocked, jailbroken or whatever, and may cause you a lot of grief, such as permanently locking itself back up again -- \"bricked\" I think is the term!  Good luck, my fellow unsavvies! (And don't mind, there are so many others worse off -- some people are selling iPhones as Unlocked, when they are simply wiped clear of data and restored to original settings!)", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good business", "Author": "trashtalkdstroy", "ReviewID": "RMM3I4Q7Y1E4K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone came about exactly shown in pictures, good condition, everything worked great.
