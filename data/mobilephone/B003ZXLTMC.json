{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LOVED it, at first!", "Author": "Dana", "ReviewID": "R2X2EGHZUUXUVE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for over a year now.  When I first got it, I loved it!  I wanted the qwerty keyboard, and going from a 'regular' cell phone without the keyboard to this, was fabulous!  In the beginning, it was easy to text (compared to the 'other' way), but I started to realize it was missing letters in the texts.  For example; I would type 'momma' and it would type 'oma'.  So you have to go back and add the missing letters.  Sometimes when you go back and type the absent letters, it would type two letters in its place, seeming like they were in the queue from the last time it was pressed.  Now, instead of being 'oma' it would be 'mmmoma'.As mentioned in a lot of other reviews, sometimes the text messages don't send (or receive) without turning the phone off and back on.  This is certainly an inconvenience, especially if you don't know you were receiving a text.  When you turn the phone back on, it takes a few minutes to find data again.One disappointment is the locking/unlocking button on the right side of the phone.  The placement of this button is really an annoyance.  When you try unlocking it with one hand and as you're holding it, trying to push the button, the screen starts sliding toward the button.  This makes the button go underneath the screen and you have to grab it with the other hand to slide it back together.  This is something you can get used to and master but still a major aggravation in the beginning.  Not to mention when other people need to use your phone and try unlocking it.The lack of apps is another disappointment.  I know this isn't a smart phone and if it is supposed to be, it is clearly lacking in apps and ability to handle data.  If you are looking at this phone for texting or as a cheaper way of having a 'smart phone', I suggest looking at another brand and/or model.  I do  caution on the Samsung brand 'keyboards' though.  With the three samsung phones I've had, the qwerty keyboards all skip or double letters when typing.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "first touch phone couldn't ask for anything better", "Author": "mcook", "ReviewID": "R1EP7LRVSNMP7B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was having problems with a phone that was also samsung.

I wish the directions were better but the paperwork does give a website to go to and that does tell you what you need to know. I love my phone. It works great and I think it is a good choice for someone who has never had a touch screen before. I do not know what happened with other customers but I swear by Samsung phones. I need the qwerty keyboard because for me the keyboard on the touch screen isn't a good idea because I have tremors. I prefer the qwerty keyboard.

I wanted the QWERTY keyboard and thought this would be a good starting place for me before investing in a smart phone.However, I found that there were never any software updates done to get rid of the bug that would cause the phone to freeze up while sending texts.Three weeks ago, my screen went dead everytime I slid open the keyboard so I couldn't see what I was typing.  Eventually it came on again for two days, then went back off again.I finally got a new phone today and it is not a Samsung brand.  I was told at the cell store that this is a frequent problem with this phone and it's been happening to a lot of people.  I'd avoid this phone if you want it to work long term.Overall, I liked the phone when it worked right but I wouldn't buy one again and the phone I had made me shy away from investing in another Samsung phone.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!

But Not Great", "Author": "ilajna", "ReviewID": "ROK3PRM9P0KA0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for about two months now.... I like it but it does have a couple annoying problems. Never experienced the problem other reviewers are having, where they need to restart the phone to send a text. HAVE noticed that when you first turn the phone on, you it takes about a minute before it will let you access the messaging feature. Kinda annoying. And it takes longer than it should to send a text... a couple of seconds each time. Also, it would be nice if text conversations were shown as threaded, but this is a minor concern to me.Worst part of this phone for me is the battery life. I have to charge it every night for several hours. It does not charge quickly, and WORST OF ALL, if the battery is low, the phone will shut off even when it is plugged into the wall. It has done this several times while I was in the middle of a conversation, or when I had it charging at night and was counting on it as my morning alarm. VERY ANNOYING. Also hate how the phone will not let you access any features except talk and text when the battery is low.... you can't access or record pictures, video, audio, etc.I do not use the internet features on this phone, so I can't comment on that.I use this like a regular cell phone, for talk and text, not like a smart phone. Aside from the problems I mentioned, it does the job for me and I like it a lot. I like the look of it, and its not too bulky to fit in the pocket of my tight jeans. The touch-screen works well, display is bright and beautiful. I have no problems using the QWERTY keyboard (but I am a girl so my fingers are small) and it is SO much better than texting with a regular phone keypad. I like the fact it will bluetooth or USB connect to your computer, so its easy to upload pics and music, or use it like a pen drive to transport any type of files. (If you do this, you WILL need to buy a SD card, or you will use all your memory up really fast.) I also like that you can use any recorded or uploaded audio clip as a ring-tone, so there's never a need to buy.I don't know if I would recommend this phone. Its not perfect, but I have never found a phone I have loved 100%. I got mine on ebay for only $60, so for that price I think its worth it.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "I can't wait to replace it.", "Author": "maddog24", "ReviewID": "R86XRPFPONNER", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I first looked at it, all of the reviews were great.  It was a great middle of the road smart phone.  Then one-by-one just like mine, the problems started.  I can send/receive about 20 to 30 text messages before it just will not receive or send anymore without shutting down and powering it back up.  This wouldn't be the biggest deal except you don't find out until you try to send one, it doesn't go out, you turn it off then back on, and all the sudden you have 3 text messages in your inbox that wouldn't deliver before.  In addition, I had the completely frustrating screen failure where there is an inch difference between where you touch the screen, and where the phone thinks you touched.  It happens in such a way that you can never reach the menu button, so the phone becomes basically useless for anything but calling out using the slide out keyboard.  The most frustrating thing about this phone is it could be a really good phone, but Samsung refuses to put the effort into sending out a patch to correct it.  I will never own another samsung phone again based on this one, and their lack of support.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "impression phone", "Author": "dee", "ReviewID": "R2TBKLXJ3LG87M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it!...thank you all the nutty things it does ....compared to the strive....its great finding new things and the touch screen..well I love it....anyway thank you again", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not that great...", "Author": "SLSavior", "ReviewID": "R2ZM5OSGS0FD36", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Okay let me start from the begining...I picked this phone from researching it and at first I loved the phone. The internet wasn't that bad (remember this isn't a high tech smartphone). The texting was okay it sucks that it didn't have threaded messaging like the iphone ect.  The touch isn't that bad and it works fine. Over all, I loved it...at first. I should also mention I am 20 years old so I really use my phone :PHere's the real facts after owning it for a few months:You get sick and tired of this phone and the little glitches get on your nerves after a while. Imagine it like when you go to work and the person keeps leaving paperballs on your table and chairs. At first you think its okay, but after having to clean up after the person you just want to snap and yell at the person.Texting:-The keyboard is slow and you really have to push the keys down or it won't go through.-Everytime you text to many text you have to turn it off and on and wait for a minute to be able to send messages again. This WILL happen. You might think \"Oh that's not that bad\" after a year you get really impatient especially when you when you have to wait to continue or start a conversation. And, especially when you want to continue an important conversation-The texting lags, if you want to know what I mean you will be messaging real fast after using your qwert keyboard and then you realize your phone can't keep up. Which brings us back to-You really have to push the keys down.Lighting:-The screen isn't that bad. It's really decent. INSIDE.-When you are out in the sunlight you can barely see the screen so you have to go in the darkness in order to get to the screen.Battery:-The battery is lousy-The battery gets worse over time-The standby time is fine, but when you want to use the internet and text the phone will die within four hours.-Not to mention you can only talk on the phone for 3 hours or less before it tells you low battery.Phone Calls:-There's not problem with phone calls besides the obvious fact that has to do with your carrier (mine is at&t;).Internet:-It's not a smart phone so you can't expect everything to go fine, but for a non-smart phone its good.-The internet is fast and decent-You cannot compare this to a smart phone like an iphone or a droid without making this phone look like dustOver allMy plan ends in June and I can't wait to get a droid or iphone. If you can deal with the texting issue and the battery and the internet isn't that great.
