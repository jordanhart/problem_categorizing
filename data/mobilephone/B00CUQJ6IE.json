{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice phone, but VERY limited memory for storing apps - microSD use doesnt help", "Author": "phoneman", "ReviewID": "R3KU0BUF6NPS7E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone has lovely features worthy of a competitor to samsung etc.4G/3G data is fast on Tmobile where they have 1900Mhz coverage, but WONT work at 4G/3G where Tmobile operate only at 1700Mhz. Best to check Tmobile's 4G/3G coverage map before buying this phone, otherwise you'll get slow 2G speeds only at 1700Mhz-only areas (this phone doesnt work at 1700Mhz, hence the 2G speeds). Works well on at&T;, and Lyca mobile (uses Tmobile for 2g/3g/4g coverage).Battery life is very good, around 12 hours with calls and data use during the day.The dual sim functionality works well, with a blue-green color scheme for indicating which carrier is being used.Wifi is OK, Bluetooth OK. Processing speed OK.You CANT upgrade the factory installed version of android (4,1) to any of the later android versions.Screen is large and bright, the back camera OK although pictures are somewhat grainy and pixelated when using the flash in indoor use.Altho the phone comes with a basic rubber-type protector, its almost impossible to get a case for this phone. Only one supplier in the US seems to sell spare batteries.THE BIG FLAW:Sadly, despite these wonderful features, the phone has a MAJOR flaw that is not revealed in the specs. Although the specs say 2GB of storage, actually after the android operating system etc is installed, you ONLY have 512MB of storage to load apps AND data for apps that cant use a micro SD card. That is, some apps like Gmail need to be in the root of the phone and cant be stored (app itself and its data) on a micro SD card. You thus can only add a few apps to this phone in total. Gmail stops working if the mailbox gets too full as there is no space to download mail.  While some apps can be stored on the micro SD card, you'll only know that this alternate storage is possible when you try downloading that app to the phone: it either stores on the micro SD card or not. If the internal memory is full, you'll have to delete other apps or not install it at all.Skype doesnt work at all, and doesnt even install as there is an error message.In other words, you'll never know whether you can install ALL your favorite apps on the phone, as the limited 512MB internal app storage memory halts the ability and the micro SD storage option isnt certain.The more expense Blu phones like the Life One have more internal app storage, so if you need apps, best to forgo buying this phone and spend extra on the Life One.Blu support in Florida is very good. They respond to email quickly and are very helpful over the phone.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blu Studio 5.0", "Author": "Dawn", "ReviewID": "R2IFGSDV3DD4QI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my son, as he liked the huge screen of the Note 2. Well my bank account said, no way to the price of a note 2 without contract. I purchased theBlu Studio 5.0 for him, popped in a T-mobile 30.00 a month prepaid sim, and WOW. This phone does everything you need it to. It does not have an S pen of course. The 3G on it is fast, the wifi works great for all his games, the play store has all the android apps you could ever want or need. It is super light weight, that is what made me skeptical to start with, as I believed that it may have been a sub par phone. Not at all. The camera took great pics and it has a front facing camera for \"selfies\".The battery seems to hold a long charge, I know this because my son plays lots of games from the app store on it. He charges at night and ready to go after school (after responsibilities and homework of course)until bedtime...BTW my son is only 11 years old.All in all we have had the phone for about 3 months now and no issues at all. I am please with the phone and its performance.ONLY CON!!!NO CASES MADE FOR THIS PHONE!! Come on Blu!!! It does come with a thin rubber back case, but this is only to protect the back from scratches when its put down or slid across a surface. I purchased a Note 2 screen protector for him and cut it to fit as the glass is NOT the gorilla glass as on most newer model smartphones.For the price, you CAN NOT GO WRONG with this one if you like a huge screen.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone is awesome after rooting.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3JPPVWYMBRIWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seriously, this phone was awesome before I rooted it but it's even better now because it was rooted.

It worked so well that she was surprised and said her manager said it would not work.  It worked great and still does.  So guess what the sales associate at MPCS told me she is getting one.  Yes the instruction booklet needs improving but you can get demos and the like on you tube from other owners.  I think the very young people want to pay 500 or 600 for status, but I can do everything on this.  And the sales associate said it even looks like the more expensive phones.

Fortunately, I found it in the Blu Studio 5.0 D530. With it's sleek design, it excellently rivals the popular overly-expensive counterparts in terms of style and functionality. The color on the screen is vibrant, the response to touch is wonderful. People are constantly asking me what kind of phone it is and are immediately interested. For what I use a phone for, it meets every expectation and I am very satisfied. Although being satisfied, there are a few drawbacks to the phone overall, but these are minor disappointments when considering the price point as being a little over $120.00 and with no contract. The first con is the 512mb RAM that is easily exhausted by downloading a number of apps. These apps can be stored on external storage media (micro SD), but occasionally, their operation must be halted in order for the phone to carry out normal text and email reception operations and can't be resumed until enough apps are stopped to make room for usable RAM. Secondly, with my experience, Having to configure the phone for data outside of a WiFi environment was somewhat of a cerebral task. I've been able to do this but am still not able to receive mms transmission. The external speaker could be a tad bit louder, but I can live with it easily! These are the only disappointments worth mentioning concerning this phone. In light of all that it is, the pros easily prevail against the cons.

It is so huge, and has the dual core memory, but a teeny internal storage issue.  After FB, email, and Pandora the phone is acting lethargic and the email stops working because it mismanages App storage.So if you plan on never installing another app, or using the phone to check email, go ahead and give it a shot.But, if you  plan on a couple apps (games, forget it, no internal memory space for that), look elsewhere.  This phone allows for a max of 500MB of internal storage (apps, not pics).  The OS takes about 350MB, so once you install a few other apps, you are within the \"Warning Range\" at which apps stop functioning to preserve phone function.PS - there is apparently a way to root the phone and get it to use the whole 2GB of space which would fix the issue.

Ive had the S3, the S4 and the Note 1 and 2 since.  The last phone I bought before this one was a Nokia, and well, I hated it.  Someone told me about these phones because I was looking to upgrade but didnt exactly have money to drop $600 on an unlocked phone since I wasnt eligible for upgrade yet.  My first reaction was \" WHO is BLU?\"  My husband makes fun of me, because anytime any one in my family including myself gets a phone, I do research! I look at what the experts think of a phone, and then look on here for reviews from customers, only this time I looked into this company as a whole, Who are they? What is their goal?  After looking at both I decided \" I might give this a try, worse case senario I can just return\" well, I ordered and got it the very next day!I was a skeptic through a through, I got this phone two days ago and have been waiting on something I dont like to appear.  (Keep in mind I am use to the Samsung standard when it comes to phones, thats a pretty high bar to try and reach for!) i pushed this phone, I had multiple things downloading, I was surfing the web.. I was making calls and texting people and NOTHING bad was happening, this phone performed like a PRO!  I have waited for software glitches, or something to happen but its been great! The only issue Ive even found is you can not make folders on your home screen so all the apps are either in your menu or on your home screen, which is really not an issue for me! The screen size is comparable to a note, just a tad bit smaller as I compared the two on top of each other. The phone COMES WITH a screen protector and a gel case that completes the phone!  My husband was also a skeptic, and he loves my phone so much, we will be buying him AND my daughter this phone!  Great screen, great camera, and even though this phone is 3G , and our carrier is a 4G provider, you cant tell it only handles 3G.  Most of the time I get a \"H\" where my signal is and that basically means a little faster than 3G.. Anyway, yes this company is new, but everyone has to start somewhere!  Give Blu a try, I doubt you will be dispeased.  Solid build phone, great features! Only one way I can say they should improve, and that is what everyone complains about their phone.. The battery life.  It lasts a day, and I am a heavy phone user, that just means I have to charge every night, so not an issue for me, but I know some ppl want their phones to last days, and thats just not realistic with every phone!", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "It would be great if I could use data", "Author": "Yolanda L Gibson", "ReviewID": "R2N7YFV1TP76AU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I haven't been able to use the internet since I got ot turned on and my service has data with it.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phone dead after 7 weeks", "Author": "zyde", "ReviewID": "R3PRKBNC9FI8RT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Dead dead dead.

Indeed I think that even if the product is not completely bad, you should check them so that the consumer receives a quality product.

Only after having the phone for over a month did I figure out the problem on my own. Neither Blu nor StraightTalk were helpful. Also, the phone is always low on memory, and tends to run slow sometimes. This is why I would highly suggest having an SD card to put your apps on. Another problem I have is that only the headphones that come with the phone work properly with the phone. The ones they come with are really crappy and even now those ones are falling apart.

The last problem occurred today and the screen turned completely white and now the phone is useless unless i replace the screen . Among other small problems were short term battery life, speakers too low etc. its a good phone if you dont plan to keep it for more than 3 months otherwise i think you would be better off buying a more expensive and durable phone for what its worth.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "FUN FUN FUN", "Author": "Auntlucy", "ReviewID": "R3SUNG5PSJS9XP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because I actually live on 2 different continents and this phone has 2 SIM card slots.It may not be an IPhone but for the price who cares.I have loved it.I had it out of my purse while in a local grocery store in Italy and I attracted a crowd.It seems that younger men are particularily interested in my new purchase.What a great toy and phone too.It has gone beyond my expectations!!", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "I Really Like This Phone", "Author": "lisar915", "ReviewID": "R1CQCMYIFLYPE7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's bigger than my original Samsung Galaxy SIII.

I only realized it on the phone when I ran out of space to install apps the first day I had it, and then called BLU support, who verified it, because it was hard to believe. Not half as much as other similar BLU phones I have encountered. Amazing because it has very few Bloatware factory unremovable apps on board.Apparently BLU engineering designated other RAM memory just for photos and the like.  Why would the do this?  Couldn't get my all my needs apps to fit!!!Other BLU phone in this price range have at least 1.0GB available - and that is also paltry, but manageable for many people for whom I set these phones up.There are  definitely other Blu phones with more memory available and on paper the specs look the same, but again:The ONLY to find out before you buy it seems to be to call BLU Support first.

Call quality is fine, speaker isn't amazing but it's fine.  The camera, too, isn't impressive but it's about as good as most other smart phone cameras.I'd say the major weakness of the phone is its extremely small internal memory.  I did install a 32GB mini-SD card, It took a little playing around to figure out how to move my apps to the SD card, to free up the memory on the phone.  Even having done that, I'm to the point now that any time I try to download a new app, or my email, it says there's insufficient memory available.  The phone gives me a message that I need to \"unpin some tasks from the taskbar\" but doesn't tell me how to do that.  There's nothing that looks like a taskbar, or pinning, on this phone.  I'm sure I'll figure it out at some point, but I would rather the phone just work like everyone else's.  Note that I am not a huge app user; I've filled up less than 1 GB so far on my SD card.The battery life is fine.  I'm not a heavy user, so during a day I'm probably on the phone for 10 min, send less than a dozen texts, and spend maybe an hour or two on the internet and using apps.  I always have some battery at the end of the day but sometimes it's down to 20-30%. If you are a really heavy user you would probably have to charge it during the day.  It takes 3-4 hours to fully charge.Overall  I'm happy with my purchase- this is my first smart phone, and I didn't want to be in a contract and I can't imagine having to worry about dropping a $300+ phone.

I bought it to help resolve some travel issues and have only used it sparingly since. The little Samsung is unlocked and certainly suitable for my use in Germany and here in the US.I decided, however, to look into a smart phone for my upcoming vacation in Germany this October. I settled on the Blu Studio 5.0 since it was unlocked, offered dual SIM capability, a decently-large screen, 3G and Wi-Fi, and, above all, a modest price. I wasn't convinced that a smart phone really offered me sufficient reason to spend more money for a top-line phone.So, I've used the phone for two weeks now, including 7 days in Germany and am pleased with the phone. Phone conversations were no problem from either end that I could tell and I didn't have the audio adjusted higher than about half way. I didn't use the earpiece or radio, so can't comment there. To this point I haven't noticed a problem with the charging connection that others have complained about, and I typically charged the phone almost every night. It usually didn't need charged, but I did so to see if the connector would turn out to be a problem; so far not.My biggest complaints on the phone would be that the manual is quite poor, so I found it easier to search Youtube for suggestions in using an Android OS. And the screen is hard to see outside, although such is the case with just about every other phone I've seen or tried. I don't have the best eyesight and I am color-blind...  And as others have suggested, it would be great to have a decent silicone cover like the one that I purchased for the Samsung on Amazon. I found the cover supplied with the phone to be poor as I couldn't activate the on-off button with any consistency when the cover was mounted.Will the phone hold up? Will it receive Android updates? I don't know, but so far I'm quite pleased with the phone.

But the total lack of netflix? Come on. The $50 prepaid phone plays netflix fine. According to blu they are \" working on it\" but have no eta. Basically a \"just buy a different phone\" answer.Viewing angles are poor as well. looking at it like you would any other phone means the bottom half of the screen is blacked out. Tilt the top away from you and it's better.The screen size is big, but it's a polished turd at best.Waiting for the nexus 5, then this will go one of my kids, if they can handle the lack of netflix.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "any blu product", "Author": "Ravi", "ReviewID": "R300SYEY9ZMDDI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not a good phone garbage so mad a waste of money never again blue isn't a good brand buy a Samsung", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.00", "Features": "Unlocked Dual Sim 5.0-Inch WVGA Display, 1 GHz Dual Core Processor\nAndroid 4.1 Jelly Bean, 3G 850/1900/2100, HSPA 7.2 Mbps, 4GB Internal Memory, Micro SD up to 32GB\n5MP Camera I 0.3MP Front, HD Video Recording 720p, Auto Focus, LED Flash\nBuilt-in Apps: Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Google Search, Maps, Gmail, Youtube, Calendar, Google Talk,  Google Play Store\nSupports Video Call", "Name": "BLU Studio 5.0 Unlocked Dual Sim Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41iXdRtiBfL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CUQJ6IE"}}
