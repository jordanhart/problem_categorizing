Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R3BTRKARY7YYES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will state right in the beginning my view that Blackberries continue to be the leaders when it comes to security, data efficiency, reliability and and practicality. My company-issued Blackberry does not do games very well and I'm not using it to play movies (I prefer the 73\" screen in the living room for that) but it's amazingly good when it comes to getting my email and quickly composing new messages or replying to the incoming. Also great at integrating the enterprise email with any Web email services I'm using, Bluetooth-paired devices and the phone features be they 4G or Wi-Fi.Current Bold users should be happy and almost certainly happier with the 9930 because this is very much the 'old' Bold only sleeker, faster or, in other words... bolder. When it comes to new users, it's a crowded marketplace out there. Those who prefer great physical keyboards may want to look into this Bold because you could hardly find a better 'phone' keyboard anywhere and that includes other Blackberries. I am currently a Torch user but I've been given the opportunity to try out a couple of the newer models: this new Bold and the new Torch 9810. The Torch has a slightly larger screen but, in fairness, few phones come close to the new Bold when the factors considered are elegance, the quality of the build and, naturally, the keyboard.First, the good things:- IT'S STILL A BLACKBERRY - This is important to the many BB users who want their Blackberry to change only slightly from one generation to another, at least as far as the physical form and the user interface is concerned. While Blackberries evolved from the little 'wheel' to the track ball to the current touch-sensitive pad to touch screens, they are still recognizable and I bet that if a time traveler from, let's say, 2002, popped up in 2011, he/she should be able to use the 9930 in no time. All buttons are at the familiar locations and, at least when comparing it with the previous generation, the 9930 responds very much in the same way with 'touch' added if needed but never mandatory to accomplish anything. I find myself using a combination of touch, buttons and sometimes to track pad to operate it.- IT'S SMALLER, LIGHTER - While the screen appears to be (very slightly) larger on the 9930, its bulk is significantly reduced. This model is thinner and it appears to weigh less than its predecessor. Not everyone may appreciate this in the beginning and I was one of those but I got used with the lighter device quickly and I would consider it an improvement now.- TOUCH - Not the first Blackberry with the feature and it's not as good as iPhone's but, for what I'm using it, it's just right. The new Blackberry OS allows me to 'touch' just about anything on the screen and trigger... something. Gestures are also supported including 'pinch-zoom' in and out. And, related...- BUTTONS - Maybe this should have been at the top of the list. This Blackberry does not force me to do everything by touching the screen. Just about everything can be done by either pushing/clicking a button and controlling the cursor with the little trackpad or by interacting directly with the screen (tap virtual buttons) or a combination. Most of the time it's 'a combination' for me and it's always the way I feel most comfortable about doing things. I appreciate the ability to use physical buttons when I want it.- IMPROVED PICTURE QUALITY - Very much on par with what's current 'best in the business', the picture is significantly better as far as brightness and resolution.  I would not use the Bold to watch movies or read books with the Kindle app but this is because I don't use Blackberries that way. I could if I wanted to. To me Blackberries are expected to do: email, voice, enterprise integration. Everything else is 'extras' - my employer wouldn't like to see me watch movies, play games or update my Facebook wall on the company 'phone'.- BETTER KEYBOARD - Believe it or not, this Bold's keyboard is even a better design that the predecessor's. The keys are slightly larger because keys now stretch from edge thus gaining maybe an extra 1/8 of an inch to distribute among the 10 or so keys on each row. I noticed the difference immediately.- EXTRAS - Of course, you get cameras with geolocation which I'm not likely to use a lot but it's good to know it's there, you can get video for free or subscribe to some pay services, have the ability to store various media and so on. It's good to have them but I'm not likely to spend much time with the 'extras' except maybe with the Web browser which, by the way, is very good at handling HTML5.- IMPROVED WEB BROWSER - This is good news. The built-in browser may not be as good as, let's say, Opera but it's coming pretty close and it's a major improvement over what Blackberry used to offer. This one is, of course, touch enabled.- Bluetooth, WI-FI - they work great and pairing with a Bluetooth device can be done literally in seconds.In addition to the above, on the 'the same' or not necessarily 'improvements' category, I noticed no significant change as far as battery life is concerned. Hard to measure it but I would recharge it every couple of days if used for phone/email only and at least daily if a lot of web browsing or video is involved.On the not-so-good or 'really annoying' side, I really hated the abundance of bloatware - I call it 'crapware' - that seems to have invaded the Blackberry world. There is an abundance of little pre-installed apps and services that, shortly after you click on and go to the trouble of activating them, it turns out that they are 'pay' things, ranging from Pac-Man to TV services, and it's either impossible or very difficult to remove - I didn't have the time to waste so I was able to quickly hide them but... there SO MANY of them. If RIM is listening, they should know that I do NOT love Blackberry more for turning the BB desktop into some apps and services peddling space. Blackberry's app store continues to be difficult to navigate, overpriced and quite unattractive.When it comes to rating this new Bold, within the context of Blackberries, it's probably one of the best and I am now hesitating between this and the Torch. It's lighter, brighter, sharper, faster and provides more functionality than previous models so it's a five-star.And, yes. The Blackberry is not an iPhone or an Android. And the reverse happens to be true: iPhones and Androids are not Blackberries. I'm using a Honeycomb tablet for personal entertainment and there is an iPad in our household but what I've been using a Blackberry for 'business' quick, efficient and reliable communications for the past 10+ years.

The screen is very high quality and the touch functionality works nicely.To me, the differentiating factor of a Blackberry (at least with their current OS) is that it has a full keyboard.

On the contrary, this device does a very good job of integrating Twitter and Facebook into the factory-ready experience.

I can make and receive calls but the blackberry service would not work on the phone.  All I am receiving is a whole set of instructions from the seller as to what to do to get the bb plan working.  I am not a technical person and I don't know what to do and I am not playing around with the phone if I do not know what to do.  I wouold have to spend more money now to take it to a technician.  I should not have to do that, the phone should be internationally unlocked not only for calls but for the blackberry service provider in all countries.  I am not at all pleased.  I feel if a phone is unlocked...it should be entirely unlocked.  I should not have to be spending additional money to get it unlocked to the bb service.  This is ridiculous!!  Furthermore the phone does not have the product tag by the battery compartment and the company is saying that all their 9900 have tags, they have advised me to send back the phone and they will investigate it to see if the phone came from them.  The phone came from them, that's the phone I took out the box.  From what I am hearing it looks like I have been sold a stolen phone or a refurbished phone.  All the company has been doing is sending me instructions on how to get the phone to work, they never once advised me to send back the phone.  I asked about a refund and was told nothing about a refund...but they are willing to exchange the phone for another one.  I will not be purchasing anything more from this company.  The rep that dealt with me never once offered me a number to call him and discuss it, I had to ask for a contact number in the latter stages.  In my opinion I have been ripped off, paid for a new phone but instead it looks like they sent me a used one.  I have since sent back the phone to the seller and they exchanged it for one that is actually working better.  I think that phones should be thoroughly checked before being sent out to customers (especially those in the international region).  How can you have a phone on your shelf that does not carry the label with the information about the phone (that sticky label that is usually found behind the phone by the battery compartment), and then ship it to a customer, that to me is carelessness on the seller's part.  I cannot blame the carrier, since the carrier did not sell me the phone.  The seller in this case, is the one to blame for the faulty phone.  The seller was helpful all through the process.

So I went over to the local ATT store to get a new Bold 9700. No luck, they no longer sell the 9700 but they did have the 9900. I wasn't completely crazy about the size of the 9900, but I use BBM for work so I decided to go for the 9900 (the only other choice at ATT was the Torch, which is WAY too big). I'll get a hundred BBMs a day from my colleagues around the world (I work in an international sales team). And I use AT&T; because I do a lot of business travel and its nice to get BBM when I'm in Singapore or Taiwan.I've had the 9900 for about a month now and I think it is the best BB yet. First of all, I love the screen. It is very bright, the icons are very sharp and when I take pictures with the 9900, they pictures look great on the screen. Next, the touchscreen is easy to use. I spent a few days getting my favorite applications in the 'Favorites' folder so that I don't need to go to the 'All' folder anymore. And the new 'Search' feature is much easier to use than Search on the 9700. I have always used the 'Search' feature on my BBs (searching for something in the body of an e-mail message on my BB has always been faster than my desktop computer), but the way Search is implemented on the 9900 is much better.Next, the browser actually works. On my Bold 9700, I would get errors on many web pages but I have not seen this on the 9900. Last, the keyboard has a very nice sculpted feel to it. I like the 9900 keyboard better then the 9700 keyboard.I like to compare the BB to the iPhone. My wife has an iPhone 4, which she has had for about three months. When she needed a new phone and we went to an ATT store, the girl at the store sold her on the iPhone 4 by saying \"it will change your life\". It has not changed her life but she does like the iPhone. But she has a very tough time typing text messages on her iPhone, which is very frustrating for her. I think the screen on the BB 9900 is sharper than the iPhone 4 (but this might be due to the screen protector in the iPhone 4 which makes the screen a bit fuzzy). She has not installed many apps, but she has installed the weather app which she uses often. My favorite apps for my BB are gwabbit and Bloomberg. Gwabbit automatically makes entries in Contacts if it detects a well formatted signature on an e-mail.Bottom line: if you need a Blackberry and you can't get a 9700, go for the 9900. The touch screen is easy to use, the screen is very sharp, the new Search feature is great and the browser works well.  I would have given this review 5 stars except that the size of the 9900 is a little bigger than my old favorite, the BB 9700.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "No detallan los productos", "Author": "Laki Loko \"Laki\"", "ReviewID": "R22TZY8TRJCHJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Les comento que si recibi mi articulo Blackberry Bold 9900 pero no era lo que esperaba, me refiero a que no es compatible con la operadora que utilizo aqui en mi pa\u00eds y todo esto se debe a que algunos vendedores no quieren especificar claramente lo que en realidad venden por Amazon, en varias oportunidades le envi\u00e9 un correo a este vendedor para que me confirmara sobre las Bandas 3G que \u00e9ste equipo ten\u00eda y nunca me respondi\u00f3, pues mi mala suerte fue que recub\u00ed un equipo T-Movil con Bandas 1,4,8 y necesitaba era 1,2,5,6 para 3G lo cierto es que tuve que vender el equipo con mucha pena, ya que no lo pude disfrutar.

It was NIB with AT&T; branding which was absolutely PERFECT for me (you can guess why). I have no idea if it was locked or not though, because I wanted it for AT&T; anyways.HARDWARE:The keys are brilliantly soft, yet very easy to type on (with my fists of meat and fingers of butter) The screen is a decent resolution too, it's sharp yet very bright in daylight. The speaker is loud and crisp in calls, but a little less quality for a/v than the Curve (who cares). The touch screen is on-par with standard devices today, and is always a neat party trick for non-blackberry people. It's also a great feeling to have the same zooming, panning, map control and etc as an Android device.Battery life is a bit crap, it lasts all day on normal use but only just. The processor power may to blame for that. The camera is so-so, I wouldn't skin a website with photos from it like I did with my Samsung Galaxy S2. Call Quality is decent, nothing to write home about either.SOFTWARE:BB7 (Blackberry OS 7) is very intuitive and has some great features, but it's a bit unstable... and there's less apps for it than BB10. (Next phone is definitely a Q10 unless they release something better.) It's a nice-looking OS but misses a couple important marks in 2014 like Voice control, Text-to-speech, and an instant web search capability. It's definitely a great communicator though... as BlackBerry has always been, and Blackberry hasn't fallen short on that at all.OVERALL:Great overall for Blackberry 7 Devices, Not so up-to-speed on the whole smartphone world.

I didn't buy this phone from Amazon's website.I bought this Bold Touch 9900 for my uncle in December 2012. He wanted touch screen, wi-fi capable, qwerty keypad, 5MP camera with flash(very important), BLACKBERRY. This was the result.Seemingly there's a company out there selling refurbished phones and repackaging them with shrink-wrap and calling it NEW. I paid some $420 for this phone only to have it arrive with a cracked back case. The phone had scuffs and was clearly not brand new. My uncle later complained that the camera quality was bad. I thought \"Oh no, the refurbishing people swapped out the camera for a lame one\", but that's not the case.You'd take it for granted that a phone sporting 5MP with flash and a price tag of $420 would have a decent camera right? WRONG! I couldn't believe my eyes. Pictures taken in broad daylight under the shining sun look as grainy as low light night pics and its no fault of the people who refurbished it.I was checking GSMARENA.COM for a camera quality comparison today. The website feature to check camera quality showed how horribly grainy it is. What's even more shameful is that in December 2011 I paid around $150 for a Xperia X8 with a 3.2MP camera whose picture quality is worlds better than this $420 phone. I really don't understand how people rave about the quality of this phone's pics. Its right down there there with the quality of the Nokia C1-01's 640x480 resolution camera.I'd recommend to anyone else to do full research before buying a phone and to avoid the refurbished rubbish in a box, buy from a reputable company like AmazonLLC; they've never let me down.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "The worst experience ever!", "Author": "Onir Pernia \"Onir Pernia\"", "ReviewID": "R38RVCEL6YMNSZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First of all, let me start by saying the cellphone is somewhat good if you get exactly what you are looking for.Let me get to my story, first of all I started by sending an email to \"Ross Cellular\" which by the time I bought it, their items were Fulfilled by Amazon, anyway on the email I asked clearly enough if the cellphone was NEW, they said yes, and it was nothing but a total scam, the cellphone was clearly used, for crying out loud, you could even see all the scratches from previous owners. Either way, the next thing I left perfectly clear to the buyer was that I needed my cellphone to work on AT&T; 3G+ kind of networks, they assured me it did... What was my second surprise when I start the phone? The darn thing was a T-Mobile branded cellphone, meaning I'm stuck with EDGE in places where I don't have WIFI coverage, and not to mention the signal reception on this thing is TERRIBLE... your signal ends up dropping everywhere you go with medium to low reception, you'll get familiar with the SOS sign on the screen, if you know what I mean.Now back on topic, the cellphone is pretty nice, I'm specially digging the fact that you can have a DUAL-EXPERIENCE (physical keyboard and touch screen). In my own personal case I use it as a secondary cellphone (main is a Samsung Galaxy S4) Though if you are using it as a main cellphone I would recommend getting something with a better value for your money, honestly you are better off with anything else out there on the market.If you plan on buying this cellphone anyway, make extremely sure you don't get it from \"Ross Cellular\" as they are nothing but a rip off.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Kerran", "ReviewID": "R1PNO92E717S1P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Meet the expected standard, I was very happy with the purchase.

Brown", "ReviewID": "RHTZLGR1XIE43", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Blackberry 9930 Blackberry Bold Touch 9930Definitely the best BlackBerry I have used since 2002 - previously 3 physical keyboard models, and a Storm I and II.  The oldest models were a little too wide; another had keys too close together; and the two Storms were difficult to type on one-handed while walking (offset with the use of Dragon voice).The screen is beautiful and clear, but most news websites are difficult to read without using the zoom feature; and that means more touching to read side-to-side.  I have a BB Playbook, so the website connections are typically handled on that device.  Email and apps work and view perfectly, however.I have downloaded a lot of apps that I find useful, and I am a heavy user of the phone during the day.  So far, the processor and memory have been great and handled the load, and  I have not experienced any crashes or delays in screen turnover.  The Bridge feature, used with the Playbook, has also been great, as the phone can be used as a touchpad and keyboard, which is very handy on train / plane commuting.All of my calls have been clear and reception has been excellent.The ONLY downside is that the battery completely drains before the end of a workday (with bluetooth and wireless active).  Accordingly, I carry an extra battery and a battery charger (7800 mAh), which is more than adequate to get through a day, and the charger covers extended travel by plane for all of my devices.

This blackberry is so much fun to use, great OS and friendly interface. Of course the blackberry trademark qwerty keyboard and trackball are the usp. Cons are the touchscreen and the battery. I was fully aware of the limited battery life, but since its compensated for by the slim size, I feel its a decent tradeoff. Just need to remember to charge it pretty regularly and have bought a couple of extra chargers to keep at all places at all times. The touchscreen is not very intuitive and a little difficult to use if you have big fingers and of course doesn't compare to the apple experience, but the awesome trackpad helps out a lot. All in all a great device and I received it exactly as advertised by Worldwide Distributors. Its an unlocked AT&T; phone which I received and if you are a t-mobile user you will not be able to use 3G.

I had always heard what good phones Blackberry's were so I bought one. However, when my two year contract is over I am getting rid of it and will never buy any Blackberry product again. I'm giving this phone one start only because this site does not give an option to give no stars.1) Soon after buying I tried to download some apps and all of them got a message that it was an unknown. I still was charged for them however. I attempted to contact Blackberry support three times and never got any reply. There is support is non-existent. I no longer even try to download their apps.2) App world has the worst apps ever and it doesn't even have well know apps like Linked In and others. Isn't Blackberry supposed to be for professionals? Yet no Linked In...really? If they did probably get \"unknown error\" anyway!3) It constantly gives error messages when on the the internet that server not found or certificate not trusted. It also just drops the connection and you to go back in over and over before it accomplishes your task. The Internet is worthless on this phone. Also sometimes Blackberry's email goes down so no email!4) The phone constantly freezes so much so that I  always have to take the battery out and reinsert to get it going again.5) This is a little thing but it points to the poor construction of the phone. The battery cover will not stay on so I have to tape it shut. The cover is not broken nor is the phone ...it just won't stay on.There are more problems, I just don't remember all of them as I write this.
