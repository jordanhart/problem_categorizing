{"Reviews": [{"Title": "No cable to move media between computer and phone...", "Author": "mad G.I.", "ReviewID": "RWCVMVYHLCXAL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just bought this phone for my wife, in pink of course. The phone is metal, but feels a little flimsy to me. My biggest complaint is that once again, the manufacturer wants you to buy a transfer cable, at a ridiculous price no doubt, to move files to and from the phone. It takes nice pictures for a cell phone, and good video as well. Also plays MP3s with good quality sound for a cell phone, either from the speakers or headphones. But, the cable is very frustrating, they are just finding ways to fleece the customer for something that should be standard for a multimedia phone. The USB is of course proprietary, so you have to get the samsung cable. Would not recommend unless you have a blue tooth computer.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001TJRT8C"}}
