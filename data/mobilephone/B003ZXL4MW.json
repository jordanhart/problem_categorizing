Hornik \"gtbino1\"", "ReviewID": "R3HSHT5YA3XAEL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had my t469 for exactly 2 years now (purchased in Spring 2010). I was a t-mobile (US) customer, and I used this phone in the US (primarily) but I also traveled with it extensively to the UK & Europe. The multi-band ability to use CDMA and GSM networks was crucial.Was it reliable? Yes.Does it do everything well? No. - Call capability: call drops were very infrequent (this was based on travel and coverage). Call quality was only OK. Its not a crystal clear sound coming through this phone, and I noticed a much better sound while using my bluetooth instead of the built-in speaker. - Texting: the QWERTY keyboard was great...it made texting for work and personal use very quick. However, light finger touches tended to cause missed key strokes. - Camera: Mediocre to poor. Yes, I realize I bought a PHONE, not a camera, but I used all of the functions when available (my primary camera is actually a camera, not this phone). Pictures would routinely be blurred by the slightest movement. The shutter speed is very slow, making picture taking a difficulty science based on timing and steadiness. - Internet: Mediocre. Yes, you can surf the web...but don't count on many webpages to open. Even those optimized for mobile devices would have issues with embedded links. - Music. Yes, it plays music too...but I bought this PHONE to talk on, not use it to work out. It will NOT replace or even come close to replicating an mp3 player or iPod. The sound is mono (no stereo) and very \"tinny\". You can not use good headphones to improve quality; there's no standard headphone jack.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "T469 GRAVITY CELL", "Author": "LAMBROS", "ReviewID": "R2XNNX8LTRMK5E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this cell is fine!  it's very clear, Perice, and very easy to use.  i also bought the plastic clear protective case which is very easy to install, and the slide feature to text works with no problem at all. i recommend this cell to anyone who still wants numbers to dial instead of a touch screen, and you still will be popular with your peers!  best.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "My favorite Dumb phone", "Author": "Mary Heimerman", "ReviewID": "R1L7XZRNRNB7YC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've bought several of these for my family.  We are not into data or smart phones, but we text constantly.

I do not think this phone was worth the price I paid for it ($70.44), I am using it and getting by, but I now feel I should have spent the extra money and bought a new one.I was somewhat disappointed for a number of reasons; 1)the phone has had water damage, 2) the battery also had water damage; 3)the charging cord that came with the phone is not the original cord, it works, but not as well as the original cord would; 4)and the screen was scratched as well as the casing.I will be more careful the next time I make a purchase.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy Phone to use and very sturdy!", "Author": "Kim Michael", "ReviewID": "R2E9IS5CCR5KZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a sturdy, easy phone to use.Second one we have bought and it works great!

I want it to work, and I want it to be reliable. So I searched for phones that had good ratings, qwerty keyboards, and a reasonable coolness factor. I thought it was going to be perfect when I looked into the gravity 2. However I would caution everyone to go to a store to buy it. Not online. shopping in a store you can quickly and easily obtain, use, and return if the product is faulty.

Good phone.", "Author": "Simon N.", "ReviewID": "R2YKWY0Z3LROY3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received it within three or four days. I was pleased with he product. There were no scratches or dents. I turned it on and it worked perfectly. There are lots you can do it. It has great battery life too. The only problem I had with it was after about 7 months of having it, the some of numbers on the key pad were not working very well. Also the camera is absolutely terrible, the zoom is horrific and terrible picture quality. Although it does have a great editing system for the photos.But other than that it was great. The only other thing I would recommend is that you buy a screen protectors and a case. This phone easily gets scratches and tiny dents. But that's probably just me being reckless. I would recommend this phone for anyone.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great service", "Author": "mokiblue1", "ReviewID": "RTXHMVYDK33AO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Product came quickly and as described!
