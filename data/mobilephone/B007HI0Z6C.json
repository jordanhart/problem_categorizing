If that doesn't work I need to put it on the charger then turn it on.  It'll be fully charged yet not turn on.I returned it to Sprint and got another Fury.  Did the same thing.  Found out that many others have had this issue.Sprint found nothing wrong with both phones, which to me means there is an issue with the phone itself since I'm not the only one with issues of it shutting off for no reason (but I had to pay to replace it anyway, ugh).One star because I cannot do zero stars because of the shutoff issue.  The first phone did it three times in the first two days I had it, the second one did it two times in the first three days I had it.I am now with an LG Viper and so far am happy with it.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do NOT Buy It!", "Author": "Luke", "ReviewID": "R31V2A1BBTN313", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone has an annoying habit.  It turns itself off randomly and then you have to remove the battery in order to be able to restart the phone.  You do not want the headache.  Spend your money on something else, a Happy Meal maybe.  Sprint says there is nothing wrong with the phone and ZTE techs say it isn't their problem.

It turns off randomly, all of the time, for no apparent reason. You have to remove the battery to get it to restart. I was sitting on my couch one day, listening to Pandora, when it turned off 22 times in less than 2 hours. I counted. I called Sprint and they've told me that it needed to be updated. I updated it and it's no better. I HATE this phone.

Sometimes it would not come back on for hours, even after removing/reseating the battery and connecting it to charger. Sprint cannot fix it.

It was cheep, looked like it had everything she'd need. including a nice display, good responsiveness when running apps, and enough memory for someone who doesn't use the phone much beyond being a phone and a few small apps. And it mostly does though.However, within the first week, the phone would shut off and require the battery to be pulled out in order to restart. I can't highlight this issue enough, as it happens almost every day now, and it makes the phone even more useless than it otherwise already is given the other issues.Meanwhile, the voice quality on the phone is such that sometimes she can't hear the person on the other end, sometimes they can't hear her, and there's a lot of beeps and vocal distortion on her end that makes it potentially painful to talk to her (think loud mic feedback and cracking/beeping about 20 dB higher than the voice volume). Even when it's not adding the sci-fi soundtrack of effects, her voice can sound like she's moving the phone away from her face even when she's not. Voice quality when it's at it's best is worse than any Sprint phone I've ever owned (customer since '99).So, bad voice quality and shutdowns, but that's not the end of the woes of this phone. The battery life, even when it doesn't shut down, is generally bad. Maybe 2-3 hours of talk time, if the phone doesn't get too hot to talk on first. The phone even when on doesn't always ring (anecdotally, 1 in 6 times when calling the phone repeatedly from the same room). Now, why didn't I replace this? I did. The phone new phone does the same things. So, save yourself the frustrating, and try something else. It's not worth the frustration.Pros: Nice looking screen, responsive in apps for the price, not much bloatware.Cons: Bad voice quality, bad battery life, shuts down randomly.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Avoid at all costs", "Author": "Jeremy Konst", "ReviewID": "R2VDM0LK0VTIQS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this for my wife, who wanted to move into the Android arena.
