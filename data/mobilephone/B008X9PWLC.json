{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Phone for a low amount", "Author": "Reece Wilson", "ReviewID": "R1VV83Q5KEGTZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone after I broke my Samsung Galaxy II while hiking. I didn't want to spend another 600.00 for a phone so I researched on the internet for a good android phone on a lower budget and that's how I ended up with the LG L7. Its a 2012 version but the phone is extra slim--touch screen--current apps available with LG features. The phone runs on a 2G/3G network but if you have a 4G plan it will still work. I am not for sure if the phone switches between 2/3/4 but you have to remember this phone is not a 2013 4G version so it may run slow at times. The phone is unlocked and all I had to do was insert my SIM card and it automatically registered with my T-Mobile network + it shipped in the appropriate new box with all it's wrappings and cords. If you want a nice slim android phone that has current features and low cost this phone would be for you. Please remember its not an I-phone nor a Galaxy Note but can be compared to the Galaxy S model", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good phone, No Spanish language", "Author": "CARLOS PAUL GONZALEZ INDA", "ReviewID": "R3ET1VGK0ZUI8A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phone is very good. It has an excellent performance, and the over-all size and screen size is just right.Just be aware that it seems that this product is destinated for Asian markets, so the system language are English and a lot of Asian languages.
