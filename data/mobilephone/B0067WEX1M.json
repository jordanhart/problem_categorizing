{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect Out-of-the-box", "Author": "Symonster", "ReviewID": "R31M87WAFN0ESX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited from November last year when I first saw the reviews on the Note until a few days ago to finally order it through Amazon. After making the decision to buy, I had to decide which vendor to order from (TRD Trading GmbH). I made the right choices all the way. When I received the box, inside was another box and inside that box was the Note and a power adapter. The Note was sealed in its own box and my confidence went through the roof. After working through the app's I plugged it in to charge it. After about 3 hours of charging the note has an audio indicator when the charge reaches 100%. I turned it on and it went into the notification screen and automatically began an update from 3.2.5 to 3.2.6. So far so gooooood.Everything that the device has installed is as close to perfect as you can get. Yes, there are newer apps and I later downloaded a few of those but if you leave the functions as they are, there are no complaints. My favorites are, MP3 player with 5.1 surround sound with a headset plugged in. The note and stylus function are superb with just about every feature you can imagine.The FM radio is great. The GPS is spot on and the mapping graphics are superb due to the screen resolution. The screen has no pixels that I can see and the depth and color are outstanding. The 8 mega-pixel camera is just as good as the iphone 4s. This device stands above all the other devices I have owned. Ipad 1, Ipad 2, Asus Transformer, Asus Transformer prime, HTC Flyer, Samsung Galaxy 7.0. I have been looking for the ultimate device with the smallest footprint. I found it in the Note. This device is so snappy when opening any apps or widgets. Online via WiFi with just 1 signal bar was faster than anything I have experienced before. The Bluetooth is a rocket when paired to my i mac 24.When in public, people can not keep their eyes or hands off it. GREAT JOB SAMSUNG. I sold my new iphone 4s to a friend for $175.00 because her phone was stolen and it was difficult for her to pay more than she did. I don't miss the iphone at all. In fact, the Note is 20 times the experience the iphone offers. When my friend first saw the Note, she felt cheated LOL. She will have to marry me to get my Note.I ordered the SGP ultra thin case which fits like a glove but is still a little slippery so I just ordered the BoxWave DuoSuit TPU case and the little pigtail adapter to download files. Micro USB Host Mode OTG Cable Flash Drive SD T-Flash Card Adapter FOR Samsung GT-i9100 i9100 Galaxy S II 2 GT-N7000 Galaxy Note At the AT&T; store, they transferred my micro SIM to the standard SIM and I went online to Youtube to configure the phone settings, everything worked. The staff at AT&T; had not seen the Note yet and were amazed. I ordered the white model because it looks bigger. Go to Maker4U dot com to see some very cool accessories.I highly recommend this device through Amazon.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy Note", "Author": "electronicsdude", "ReviewID": "RQ6OCSCD1JQTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing!. Blows away any competition. Now if you never held one in your hands I will admit its a big phone.I never held one myself but I was expecting it to be HUGE. Its actually not as big as your read around the forums and comments people leave about it. Surprisingly thin even when compared to its size as well. Anyone who is having doubts about the phone should just go ahead and order it. You will not regret it!", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "At Last...", "Author": "Kli", "ReviewID": "R3JGHI11QQAEMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "... I feel like starting this by saying 'it's been a long time coming'. I only say that because my first attempt at getting my hands on the Galaxy Note ended with it getting 'lost' in the mail. I blame no one... that original seller and Amazon stepped up to the plate and handled everything quickly and professionally so ... on to my review!I received my Note a few days ago and have been putting it through its paces since then. I do need to say that I almost went into cardiac arrest when I opened the box to find the case open/seal broken! My first thought was to start the return process, but then I noticed a U.S. electrical adapter had been added last minute to the package as it is an import and would not have shipped ordinarily with one included. If there had been even the slightest sign of tampering, it would sadly have been returned...so far I am glad to report nothing seems out of place! My advice to the seller(s) out there: If opening an electronics order to ascertain whether a U.S. power adapter is needed, leave a little 'note' for your clientele along with said adapter... future heart attack(s) duly averted!I went with the white model which as most of you probably know, costs a little more. Worth it? Hell yeah... It is beautiful, elegant, sharp, thin, light, and yes- it's BIG. I'm a big guy with big hands and long fingers and still this thing just fits in my mitt! The thinness is what makes it manageable, but I will take no chances and down the road I will find a suitable case to carry it around in. My hope is that the company Otter Box, makers of some great heavy duty cases for other smart phones, will rise to the challenge and design something special for this behemoth!Beyond the great looks of my new white Note, one of the first things I noticed is the speed! A 1.4gH Dual Core processor is crazy, but apparently necessary to power the 5.3 inch gorgeously colorful screen. It's an easy thing to marvel at when looking at high resolution video or photos. I did a test run video shoot yesterday and it blew me away. The clarity of the picture, absolutely no stutter or choppiness... amazing! Reading text, or magazines, or web pages is a true pleasure again because of this crisp, clear, clean screen. I may update this with phone analysis once I'm set up. Tricky thing is Verizon and Spring allegedly will get their versions this year too. We will see what happens after AT&T; sets it all off. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing missing now is the Ice Cream Sandwich update. I've not been able to find a definitive word on when we Note holders will get ours (Motorola Xoom folks have gotten theirs I see...)I will give Samsung a bit more credit though because they are preparing the first OS update with some cool new functionality for the Note... not ICS, but in a pinch it'll do!In closing, I'm glad that I didn't wait to get this. I'll get to choose a few things now that I wouldn't have got to otherwise so... top dollar- well spent!...At Last!", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "2 months after buying it... the good, the bad and the....", "Author": "Dimitri Suraweera \"Dimi\"", "ReviewID": "RQQ9MEAE1RC8B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well after reading all the reviews I decided to settle on the Galaxy note eventually after much debate between this and the iphone...I bought it in early February and got it shipped to the UK as it was cheaper buying here in Euros than getting it on Amazon.co.uk. I've been using it extensively for the last 2 months. Other reviewers have made plenty of comments on the various features so i will try and keep that in summary form. I always want to know what's bad about a product when I buy it so I've focused more on mentioning the bad. However despite some of its shortcomings it is still the best phone I've ever used - the good outweighs the bad by miles.I must say that I travel between two coutries a lot and in my home country (Sri Lanka) I use this purely as a tablet with a sim that is only active for data. The other half of my time (I spend around 10 days every month in Bangladesh) I use this as my local mobile phone for calls and internet/email. However I donlt get that many calls on this when in Bangladesh compared to my regular phone.Please note that unless specified otherwise I am using all the `stock' programs for things like email that came with the Note.Firstly, what's great about it:1. Screen - excellent - the perfect size for reading emails, web browsing and especially great if you use it to read work related attachments such as spreadsheets because the screen size menas you have less scrolling around to do and the text is crisp and clear. I honestly cannot see and difference in resolution on this compared to the iphone's retina display although 'technically' the retina display has a higher resolution. If anyone can actually tell the difference i@d probably be willing to bet a lot of money that to the naked eye the difference is inconceivable. In terms of colours i think the colours on the note are actually brighter and more vivid.. but i might just be a bit biased here2. Watching Videos - Simply Awesome resolution and vibrancy etc. I've got a few HD videos which I've watched on it and it is awesome3. Wi-fi hotspot  - Just love the fact that I can share the data connection4. Kies Air - Samsung's excellent tool that allows you to transfer anything on to your phone form any laptop over the air (without the need for any cables).5. The Visidon Application (free) - this app uses your fornt camera to allow you to selectively lock certain apps using face recognition. Yes, I too was sceptical and thought that it would take a long time to recognise your face. However in bright light it takes less than half a second to do the facial recognition. It is a problem in low light but it has a password override feature. Now I give my phone to friends with no qualms - safe in the knowledge that they can play around with it, browse the net, watch youtube videos.. but cannot go and put in silly Facebook updates on my behalf because I have locked access to the facebook app. Because it allows you to select which apps you want to lock it is great. Even settings and things like access to your photos and files can be locked in this way. A must have app!!6. Contacts integration with FB and Gmail - works like a charm. I have phone numbers of people on FB and everything gets updates as long as they update their profile. It also logs activity of that person so you know what you've been doing with them.7. Portability - it is excellent to have something that is equally good as any tablet that I've used always on you. It just fits in your pocket and stays with you. Simply great!Neutral:1. Phone size - donlt believe anyone who says its too big. I've got just a 32 inch waist, am 5'10\" tall and weigh 68kg... so not a big person and the phone fits perfectly well in all the trouser/jean pockets that I've worn. ZERO discomfort. Once you've got used to the screen size on this baby you simply cannot go back to a smaller screen.2. Camera quality - is excellent in low light but I found that the iphone's quality is better. Not a problem for me because I rarely use it for snapshots and when I want good pictures I use my dslr.. not my phone! Works great for scanning business cards and even paper/magazine articles and advertisements.3. S-pen - I've used it a few times and was excited about the ability to just write down notes as opposed to carrying a book with me... but unfortunately it isn't that practical to do this. I have used this on occasion to take a photo and scribble on top of this photo (prices of things like floor tiles with an image when I was looking at refurbishing the house). Overall not used as much as I thought I would - I am not into sketching at all!!4. Siri-like voice assistance - not really used this much at all except when driving, but even that was occasionally only. A car with  good navigation/bluetooth system would be able to handle the outgoing calls equally well so this was not a particularly impressive feature for me.Things I don't like:1. In MS Exchange you cannot select which folders to sync it just syncs all your folders I think.  I would have liked to be able to sync every single email in my Inbox and `follow ups' folder. Unfortunately syncing `ALL' (date range) made the phone unusably slow. I have to then settle for syncing it for `one month'. Whilst this is not a major problem it would have been nice to be able to really individually select which folders to sync. I have found paid software available that allows you to do this, but I think the stock application should have catered to this.2. Cannot sync Outlook Notes - The `notes' in outlook just wont sync. I used to use this feature extensively but have now had to stop using it which is a bit of an annoyance. There is talk that ICS will include NOTES synchronisation for Outlook but I've not tested it yet so can't say for sure. For the moment I make do by installing Evernote, which has more functionality overall and also addresses my main need which is to have my notes synced across various devices. But it was still a disappointment3. Calendar doesn't auto sync(I've turned off the general autosync feature for applications) so when I look at the calendar I sometimes forget to sync it and there is a cance you could miss appointments. Not been an issue for me personally because I still get the reminders on my blackberry. But it has prevented me form moving completely away form the BB and using this as my primary phone.4. Email program has an annoying habit of not letting you open the attachments until body of email is downloaded. Sometimes embedded images in email bodies take ages to download especially if the email trail is long and there are 40 emails before it. This really seems silly to me.5. You cannot individually select which applications are allowed to auto sync, this is more a problem with Android than the Note though. I would have ideally like to have said that my Email program and my Gmail program are allowed to sync data automatically but for all other programs I would have preferred to do it manually. As far as I could see you can either ask all to sycy auto or none!6. On a few occasions there was an email or two that simply would not come on to the Note. It was showing on my Laptop in outlook as well as on my Blackberry torch, but it simply would not come on the note until I forwarded it fomr the BB back to myself... then It came!!!7. Battery Life - On the occasions I was using it as a phone cum tablet, the battery seemed to always die before I was ready to go to sleep. Even if you use it as only a tablet for emails and web browsing plus a bit of facebook the battery dies by evening time so i typically need to charge it again when i get back form work. I have found, however that by turning off WCDMA and leaving it only on GSM mode that the battery tends to last longer. The only downside of doing this is that web browsing and especially if you are lookingat youtube videos the speed gets slow.8. Google maps - unbelieveably accurate even in the asian countries I've been using it in like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. What a lot of people might not know is that this has an additional GPS technology that allows it to communicate with more satellites than your average phone. (I cant remember what it is technically but imagine that usually you can get only the US satellites, so if you donlt have one close by.. your location accuracy gets affected.. the note has A-GP and Glonass technology which translates to better accuracywhen  pinpointing locations. Also the large screen is a definite advantage here!Conclusion:If there was an iphone with the same screen size would I have bought the iphone instead - most certainly yes!! Why? Because ios is still sleeker and less buggy and some of the apps are better. But, until Apple starts catering to people who actually want to have at least some options as opposed to ONE option in terms of form factor etc I'm sticking with my note! I donlt normally do reviews but this product was so great that I thought others deserved to know!", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "VERY FAST COMBO PHONE/TABLET - PLEASE READ FOR FULL DETAILS...", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "R2BXN9N4SZIZHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "REVISED/UPDATE--May 7, 2013: For over one year, I have owned this phone with no problems and it still looks and performs like new! AND GREAT NEWS: On May 6, 2013, I checked and Jelly Bean OTA (Over the Air directly on the phone) is HERE NOW! And today, I installed 4.1.2 Jelly Bean and LOVE IT on the GNote, feels like I just bought a new phone! Just for you to know: Samsung began rolling out OTA in late March 2013 for the Note N7000 so it takes a while for every country to receive this. So here is is all 511 GB of it! To get the update go to Settings, About Device and Software Update (you need to be in WiFi or Data and have 75% battery). The update is HUGE because it is Jelly Bean (no more Ice Cream Sandwich)! Now more about this great phone: I thought very long and hard before I bought this device in late February, 2012 and it came SEALED in the original box - totally new and unopened! This review is for the WHITE INTERNATIONAL UNLOCKED version of this device. I bought it from Amazon but chose to do the review under the dark blue device because it has more reviews and will be read more often.***Since over one year has past since I purchased the device (Feb 16, 2012), so I am more confident about this device as it works wonderfully in all areas! The reason I mention that is ALL INTERNATIONAL phones DO NOT have a US warranty and I took a HUGE chance spending $700 (at the time of purchase, it is now about $620) for this device! However, I have owed smartphones and computers for many years and have found that if they fail, 95% of the time they fail WITHIN THE FIRST 30 DAYS! In fact all of my smartphones have \"shown\" me in the first 30 days by \"acting up\" whether they would last or not. I have NEVER (so far) had any problems with this device. It is superb. Below are PROS and CONS.PROS:1) Huge 5.3\" screen that is vivid, clear and easy to read. **The size is NOT TOO BIG for me and I am just 5'3\" with small hands and the phone is light and easy to carry around. I also bought a combo pink case/cover for $10 on eBay that is slimline and protects the phone in style!2) Great music player with good sound with headset or speaker.3) FM radio included (AT&T; version does not have FM radio). So you DO NOT have to be on WiFi or Data to listen to the built in FM Radio App!4) Fast processor.5) Data has been 3g+ to 4g for data and it is lightening fast, fast, fast! (Mostly I use WiFi, but sometimes data and again, it is very fast). I have AT&T; data that I buy each month as I have the gophone (pre-paid plan) and I buy the smallest data they have as I use WiFi 95% of the time. However, I use my Tab2 7.0 3g for my data now as it has a larger screen.6) WiFi easy to connect and works perfectly with long range ability!7) Good stock browser, however, I downloaded Dolphin HD Browser and I can get \"desktop\" pages (not mobile pages) and also tabs, and so so many features. Opera is OK, but Dolphin HD blows all the other browsers away!8) Battery life - Decent - Since I am on WiFi or Data 100% of the time when I use this device so the battery lasts me about 5 hours before I have to recharge. Now when I turn the WiFi on and off to conserve battery, I get about 10 hours or more! Also I have backlight on 90%!9) I chose White color, very regal looking - so this is a pro for me!10) Size: Perfect combo mini tablet with 5.3\" screen and great phone, don't need to lug around my 10\" tablet anymore! And I do not think this device is too big to use as a phone and have no problem putting it up to me ear to make a call. This phone is lightweight and easy to hold. I bought a pink snap combo faux leather cover/case on eBay from US seller for just $10 and it is an all in one case and cover so this device is easy to carry and it is protected at all times.11) Camera and Video Camera - This takes better pictures than my regular camera and I move the pictures to my 32 gig SD card. And video is wonderful for a quick video! Mostly I take pictures when I am out and about, so no need to have to take my old camera as this device is: CAMERA, MINI TABLET, MUSIC PLAYER, FM RADIO ALL IN ONE DEVICE!!!!!CONS:1) This is an INTERNATIONAL PHONE WITH NO US WARRANTY. However, in the box there was a 24 month warranty with a Samsung UK address and phone number for the UK warranty center. This is the only concern I have. However, in my experience, most devices \"act up\" or \"fail\" within the first 30 days, (about 90% of the time), I am not worried, as I have had the phone well over 30 days and it is working perfectly and I am very pleased with my purchase of this device. So for this ONE reason, I deducted 1/2 of a star, hence 4.5 stars instead of the 5 stars that I would have given to this device.2) APN SETTINGS for Internet Data and MMS messages must be manually inputted (all international phones require this). WiFi and text messaging works right out of the box, however, APN settings are needed for Data and MMS messaging.If anyone needs the APN settings for AT&T; or T-Mobile, please comment and ask and I will answer and give you the APN settings. Also, I will answer any questions as I am a techie type of person. Thank you for reading my review.Please feel free to join our discussion should you have any questions or comments regarding the Galaxy Note. Since I am a techie person, I will be glad to answer questions.Thank you for reading this updated review and I hope that it has been of assistance to you.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome product, highly recommended", "Author": "Rajashekar Chintalapati", "ReviewID": "RH8RJD2KHV75P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Regarding shipping - I got my Samsung Galaxy Note on Feb 3rd, 2012. Ordered on Feb 2nd, 2012. Shipped quickly.Previously I am on AT&T; with iphone 4. I have been Apple Iphone user since its release (I started jailbreaking & unlocking its features since then).This device is way better than iPhone 4 (atleast for me). Once I got my Samsung Galaxy Note, I went to AT&T; store and asked Rep that I need normal SIM (Actually all Rep's gathered to see the Note, they are amazed by the screen size & exploring its features) the AT&T; Rep who helped me, installed new regular SIM & he is trying to make sure my data plan is working (I have grandfathered unlimited data plan). I had given APN settings which I got from internet. It took some time but worked (the Rep patiently made sure my data plan is working) Rep also installed Speed Test app from Andriod market & checked the data speed - Download 1.72 Mbps & Upload 0.51 Mbps (He said there might be problem with AT&T; data traffic right now).

I haven't done anything much, out of the box tethering is working, Kies Air inbuilt app is awesome to download & upload files to Note (No need of any Sync like in iTunes). \"All share\" inbuilt app is awesome its DLNA (upnp) server you can stream your videos, photos & music to any device having DLNA client (like PS3 or google TV). Regarding Camera - Photo & video capturing, I feel its better than Iphone 4. I love the big screen, I didnt feel any comfortable regarding its size, I dont even use bluetooth for voice calls. Galaxy Note has good signal strength when compared with Iphone 4, voice is clear in Note. Some people complained about the speaker not having good volume, I did'nt observed much difference though. For me its more than enough.Regarding battery, for me its coming 1 day normal browsing & voice calls. (from me its same with Iphone too). If you are on AT&T; disable \"Fast Dormancy\" as mentioned in [URL 3] to save battery life & to increase data speeds.I bought 64GB SanDisk from amazon below is the link - Once I poped it in my Galaxy Note, it said unrecognizable disk, once I click on the message, it asked for format, once done, everything is working fine.SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging with Komputerbay SDXC USB ReaderI only felt uncomfortable while opening the backside of phone, its just thin plastic, I feared that I may break it by accident.I highly recommend to buy this device - Samsung Galaxy Note.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "After years of using Apple Iphones........", "Author": "shopper", "ReviewID": "R2KNVU6EHP9DK1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I finally decided to give android a try with the Samsung Note. I lost my Iphone 4S while traveling and needed a phone in a hurry and could not wait a few more months for the next generation of the Iphone to come out. So after much research, I decided on the Note. Both my wife and I love this device. The phone is not too big where it presents an inconvenience. The larger screen is definitely a plus!I paid $555 for it on Amazon and consider it a value. No long term contract with my carrier and a $20 micro sim card expanded my data storage another 32G's.The camera and video quality is amazing. I can take a photo of a document and read everything clearly. This saves me a lot of time as it eliminated the need to scan everything. Also the Allshare app connected immediately to my Samsung Smart TV, allowing me to play everything on my phone without the need to transfer any files. The quality once again is amazing. You have to see it to believe it. A real big plus here too.I did go through a few hours of frustration setting up the phone but it was mainly due to my unfamiliarity with Android. After a day of playing around with it, I'm very comfortable and having a lot of fun with its many functionality. Too many to mention in this review.

I see many Apple customers converting as I did unless they come up with something great for the Iphone 5 (or whatever they decide to call it).I would give it 5 Stars if Android Gingerbread had a better user interface.

First, thank you to everyone who wrote reviews,  I knew  I wanted the phone, but your reviews helped me \"seal the deal\".  Ordering the international version is highly reccomended since your phone is unlocked, leaving you with more options, and an overall more valuable phone.  Now on to the phone itself.The Galaxy Note is LIGHT, compared to my iPhone 4S (sold on Ebay), there isn't much of a difference between both phones in regards to heaviness.  This helps much since the is relatively wide for a smartphone.  I would advise one to stand over a plush rug and practice using the phone as you ordinarily would use it.  I even played a few tricks to adjust my hands to holding the new device.  The dual processors work amazingly well, I haven't experienced lag time when opening apps, or changing screens.  Also, Android OS hasn't crashed at all, a first for all Android devices I've owned.  This definitely isn't a phone for everyone.  For me it's perfect since I use my cell phone more for data related tasks, rather than calling.  Since I dread holding cell phones to my ear I always use a wired headset.  I can't say that the phone is too big, it's actually just right.  Lastly, it's a head-turner!  I shut down the AT&T; store when I went to acquire a new SIM card.  Everyone wanted to hold it.

But in addition, the seller helpfully packed a U.S. electric socket adapter and two pieces of paper, one explained how to change the language from German to English, and one to set up AT&T; as the MMS and Data access points. In the comments I will leave a link to a discussion with instructions for getting 3g and 4g on AT&T; with your Note ([...])The German version, or the unlocked European version has the Exynos processor. This means you cannot use LTE on this phone. I am fine with HSPA+, which I am getting on AT&T;, but I am adding TMobile shortly.  Download speeds at home using speedtest.net was 1258 kbps. I am not a big user of minutes or data off wifi so I am going to get an inexpensive T-Mobile plan.  T-Mobile has an excellent 30 dollar a month plan with 5gb of data and only 100 minutes, but you will only get Edge speeds (2G) on this plan, because the Note is not Pentaband. I didn't realize it when I bought it but that is disappointing.I have small hands but the size of the Note does not bother me. I usually type with two hands and use it two handed.  It fits in all my pockets,  when I'm riding my bike I keep it in my front pants pocket.  If I have a zippered back pocket I will put it in there.  I've even had it in my back pocket sitting down,  still no problems with the size.I have to charge it daily but have not come close to running out of juice. Usually when I arrive at work I charge it and the battery is at 50%.I feel like with this device I can combine my tablet and phone,  take it on vacation, leave my laptop at home and not miss anything.  It's good for reading on the train, in bed, I use it at work to chat and listen to podcasts at the gym using bluetooth headphones. I've been taking photos and I love annotating them with the spen. I'm using Evernote and Skitch, as well as Shoeboxed to organize my life.

Also got a 50 dollar gift card for buying it from them so plus 2. Was tired of the small size of the Iphone and had one since release. It was time to move on to something better and was tired of waiting for the Iphone 5 that wont come until Fall now. All I can say is wow, and what other people say when they first see it. Already tell a huge difference in the vividness and clarity of the screen, the speed of AT&T;'s HSPA+ (almost 4G) here locally. The speed of the device hands down faster than the Iphone 4. Its icredibly thin and lite for its sheer size. Completely dwarfs my Iphone with screen size alone. Bought a gal case at the local AT&T; store and paid way too much but needed protection other than from just insurance. Wasnt happy with the 40 dollar case so I ordered one from Amazon for 3 bucks and couldnt be happier, yeh 3 bucks look them up! The stylus is nice to have but havent used it much yet. I get about 13-15 hours on a charge with regular use, without wifi on, bluetooth or gps that is. Brightness all the way up. The videos look like 1080p like watching my 120hz led samsung tvs at home Im not kidding. Accepts MP4 format for videos. Watching movies on it I'm in awe. And 1080p you tube videos have to be seen to be believed. Email easy to set up once you get past Gmail account which you need to access the android market. Happy I got the white after years with a black iphone. I am able most of the time to use it one handed but not that easy takes practive I have normal male hands not huge.

I probably use the stylus once every 2 weeks to write down a quick memo.I'm a girl so I generally keep my phone in my purse or bookbag.  Girl's jeans generally aren't big enough for my phone, and my few that are only about 1/2 to 2/3rds of the phone fit in the pocket.  It can fit into guys jeans and cargo pants really well with room to spare generally.  You can sorta tell that it is in there though.I don't consider the size a disadvantage, since I love how big the screen it.I got a case that covers the front and flips over to the back (like a book).  I really like it because I feel safe putting it in my purse or bookbag, without scratching it's beautiful screen.  Make sure not to get a case with a magnet on it.  In simple terms, the pen works though a magnet in the tip of the pen interacting with your screen, and I've heard stories of a magnet in the case messing with the phone and creating permanent dead spots that can't be written on anymore with the pen.Also, when looking for cases, if it is a case that replaces the back of your phone, make sure to check if it is for the N7000 and not the AT&T; one.

The speaker is barely audible in the car unless you place it right next to your ear, music playback is quite lame, podcasts are just tolerable.2 - No LED indicator lightWhy oh why can I not look across the room and see an indication of whether I have missed a call or received a text message, why in 2012 do they make a 700.00 phone without a simple LED alert light, this in my opinion is an inexcusable omission.So, other than those two issues it is a great phone.

It is time for me to get a new phone.  I renewed the 2 years contact and got myself an iPhone 4s.  For me, comparing the iphone 4s with my old 3g, it runs a lot faster, has 8MP camera, and Siri, etc.  Other than that, it is nothing new to me.  Then I heard about the Samsung Galaxy Note.  I went to Bestbuy to check it out.  Then after I watch 2 youtube videos that compare iPhone 4s with Galaxy Note. I paid the $60 restocking fee and got myself a Galaxy Note.VideosSearch youtube \"Galaxy note vs iphone 4s dogfight part 1\"Search youtube \"Galaxy note vs iphone 4s dogfight part 2\"I have been using it for 2 weeks.  I am so happy for my decision.  The Galaxy Note is awesome.  I got myself a white case with see through hard plastic in the back that show the Samsung Galaxy Note logo.  It looks so stylish and it also comes with screen protector as well for only $15.http://www.amazon.com/Product-Anti-Glare-Screen-Protector-Samsung/dp/B007EN03K8/ref=sr_1_1?s=wireless&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1332546525&sr;=1-1But there are some of the things that I don't like.- The phone doesn't support visual voicemail.  Even I download visual voicemail program from the xda forum. It doesn't work with the Galaxy Note.- The battery doesn't last very long.  I would say about 5 hours normal use (email, facebook, phone calls, and some web browsing).- After you finished the call, you have to press the power button to make the screen come back on to end the call.  Unlike iPhone, the second you take the phone off your ear, the screen come on right away.- If you are into mobile games, iphone has more games offer than Android. (Street fighter, Cooking mama, infinite blade, etc)- Email,  if you are in All mailbox view, you cannot move an email to another folder unless you have to go to that mailbox to do it.  The move to folder option just grey out if you are in All mailbox view.- The screen is hard to see under the sun.If you have the Galaxy Note, make sure you donwload the Dolphin Browser HD.  It works excellent on Galaxy Note.  DO NOT BUY the Zagg invisible shield.  The Zagg screen protectors are the soft almost gel like type.  The stylus leaves lines and dots in the screen protector.  It ended up having trails on the screen.  It looks terrible under the sun.

Actually, it's more wide then big so to speak.  I love the thinness of it, but it is taking some getting used to.  Having said that, this phone is NOT for everyone. And yes, you need two hands to handle this thing. The screen is fantastic, the colors are beautiful.  I have used the S pen and it is a nice addition.  I doubt I will use it on a daily basis, but I have already used it to write text messages and they converted them to text.  Once again, it is a nice addition.  I can see myself using it to jot down to do lists and things like that.  This phone is fully packed and the 4G LTE is fast.  I used it at home to try it out and in Manhattan today as well.  You can turn it off under the settings menu, wireless and network, and then mobile network, so you are not constantly draining your battery.  The battery is good, but rest assure, if you stay on this thing constantly, you will be charging it every single day.  That is why I like the on screen task killer, and monitoring what is running in the background.  But since this came out in europe last year, there are so many accessories and extended batteries available.  All in all, I love this phone, and just like with anything else, I will get used to it.  Texting, netflix, reading or videos of ANY kind are fantastic on this thing.  If you can get pass the size, which I think some people just can't, LOL, then you will love this phone.  I had it in my jeans pocket today and it was fine.  I hope this helps the undecided out their.  I went from the Iphone 4G, to a HTC 4G Inspire, to the Galaxy Note.  3.5, to 4.3, to 5.3 inch screen.  I am at my limit now, LOL.  Almost got the blue/black color, but the white is really nice and the back cover is not textured like the black, it's plastic.

The battery life is amazing. With full wifi/3G etc usage you can easily get 24 hours may be more. My biggest fear was battery life but its reasonably good, as I heard from my friend who is using IPhone-4S, Galaxy note with such big screen is doing great job with battery life. If you switch to power saving mode the battery rocks, you get performance degradation but you can switch to that mode to conserve battery (such as overnight etc.). If you turn off your WIFI/DATA during nighttime when you don't actually use phone you can drag the battery to 2 days or may be 2.5 days, which is impressive.Other thing which I was worried about was the size, I thought may be its too big but it's not the case. Yes, its bigger than normal phones but once you start using it you will love it. Easy to type emails and text messages, crisp browsing, videos look a lot better on note than other smaller display phones. The phone fits easily in pockets, yes you feel it but unless you have very small pockets the phone will fit easily.I have used it with AT&T; Gophone works perfectly fine (you have to buy featured Data plan). I even got a short slip with the phone for AT&T; Data network configuration on how to configure my data network.One thing which is worth considering while buying is to order phone cover. The flip cases for AT&T; version DO NOT fit the international unlocked version, so be aware of the fact that you need to buy it from somewhere else than Bestbuy/AT&T; unless they get covers for International model.

Fulfilled by Amazon but the seller changed between the time I placed the order and when it was shipped. But the phone arrived in a sealed original box with everything intact. Had to change the language from Spanish to English since it's an unlocked international version. No warranty but I am OK with that.

I believed there will be no such a good price of Samsung Note anymore. They shipped very quick by FedEx confirmation signature. The reason I mention them because they are properly the best seller in my life. When I received the phone, after 2 days using it, I felt so bored that I updated to ICS through Kies but the phone was stuck in boot screen. I've researched a lot but no helped. I contacted Samsung service but they said they just honor warranty if we live in Europe. My phone is Germany version. I was so worried because there's no Android cellphone repair services in my area. Fortunately, I contacted the seller and I have a 1-year warranty from them. I sent my phone to them and they sent it to Samsung service in Europe. It took me 4 weeks to receive my phone but better than losing everything. They always tried their best to answer my question so quickly. I feel so thankful because I have the warranty from them.My phone is now working perfectly with the ICS 4.0.4 version (the Samsung service has updated for me), no battery drainage, fast performance and new features.Pros:- Nice performance, gorgeous huge screen.- Nice design even sometimes it's easy to accidentally lock the phone.- The Stylus pen is awesome, quick response, even I'm really bad at drawing but I love taking notes with it.- Many free and useful apps and widgets.- Have so many features that a non-jailbreak iPhone doesn't have. (I especially like the pop-up video in 4.0.4)- Camera is extremely nice outside, the flash is super bright.- Easy to put music and video, it plays .flv files which iPhone doesn't. I hate it when I have to convert my videos to mp4 and put them to iTunes and sync them to iPhone. Everything is just SIMPLE if you have the external SD card. Just plug in, copy, and paste. This makes me love my NOTE more and more.- The battery is also good since I updated to 4.0.4, no more battery drainage in idle time. I have used it for 2 days with light usage. By the way, I'm using Anker battery.- Light weight but not fits my pocket. I'm a 5.2 tall Asian female, so I'm very short but I have no problem holding the phone. It actually looks cute in my hand :)- The list keeps going on forever. Seriously, if you want to buy it just go ahead and order. You won't be regret. When you look back to iphone, you will see it ridiculous small and simple. Not fun at all.Cons:- The thing I dislike the MOST in this phone is that it's so UGLY when you watch videos having black, grey colors. I forgot the word but you will see it's very UGLY and Disappointed. I don't know why Samsung would make it with this gorgeous huge screen. The color is not accurate and beautiful like in Iphone.- There's no camera physical shutter button which is hard to capture pictures. And the shutter time is also a bit slow.- I lose 1% every 3 minutes using the phone.- Android is much more complicated than IOS. I have known IOS very well, jailbroke them, installed 3rd party apps, etc in IOS. But in Android, I'm totally a noob. I have read a lot through XDA forums and my knowledge has gained a bit but still, Android is really hard to play and you have to be careful not to brick you Note. In IOS, everything is easy.- There will be no FLASH support in Android phone from August 15th. I switch to Android just because of flash.In sum, Samsung Note is a very good phone that I really love. I'm using the Boxwave screen protector. It's easy to apply, no finger prints, and anti glare. But you will see a lot of noises when you are reading news. This screen protector is not the clear one. It's also easy to scratch. I don't recommend you to you it but you can give it a try. The cover I use is the Feelook stand cover ($17) and hard case Hello Kitty ($5). I bought them from ebay. They are both nice and protect my Note very well.Just feel free to ask if you have any questions!", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "J.

Poor battery life! I read the specs before purchasing and it says that it lasts much longer than the Samsung Infuse, my previous phone, but NOT even close! For example, I'd charge the battery on Samsung NOTE to full capacity until around noon or so and then by 6 or 7pm the battery indicator is already in the red! This is barely surfing or talking.  I never had a problem like this with my Infuse or my Samsung S2, my current phone.2. You can't create Ymail on the default android email account!! I didn't have this problem with Infuse or my current S2! I had to have 3 different email apps with the NOTE to see all my emails.  I have over 10 different email accounts such as Yahoo, Rocketmail, Ymail and Gmails.  So this is really inconvenient compared to my former phone Infuse!3. You can't turn off the loud clicking/shutter sound when taking pictures or Video recording! Again, there's no such problems with the Samsung Infuse or S2?? I like to have some privacy when taking pictures of the black board or the overhead screen projection during my class room lecture or meetings. This is really ridiculous!In summary, if you pay over $700 for a phone then it shouldn't have the problems I mentioned. Why is it that the less expensive phone can do more or give you more? It's illogical! I returned/sold the NOTE after having it for 5 days.  I hated the thought of paying so much for a phone and getting less than my previous Samsung Infuse which I sold for only $300. I now own Samsung S2 and love it! Also, I can create all email accounts onto just one app. (NOTE: Samsung S2 AT&T; version allows Ymail but not the Samsung S2 i9100 International version)  The only good thing about the NOTE is that the screen size is perfect for me. But otherwise, I wouldn't recommend the NOTE because of its price.
