{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Bit of a One-Trick Pony...but What a Trick!", "Author": "Barrett Benton", "ReviewID": "R3HO8ITAYUKZNH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, let's get the \"negative\" points of this smartphone out of the way, front-and-center:- The Hydro lacks 4G capability.- The screen is relatively small (by contemporary standards), and of moderate resolution.- You get \"only\" a 1gHz, single-core processor. Heavy gamers won't be pleased.- The 3.2MP camera (rear-facing-only) isn't much to write home about.Now, on to the meat of the matter: as a freelance IT person, I've set up scores of iPhones (from the first version up to the 4S), and any number of Android phones for clients needing help getting their heads wrapped around their new, pocketable devices. Me? I hardly felt the need for that much mobile firepower: as a long-retired gamer, I wasn't terribly seduced by large, high-res screens (that's what laptops and tablets are for, right?), and I hardly get off on the idea of watching a feature-length movie on a 4.3-inch screen, high-def or not. I was more than happy with a BlackBerry Curve for my needs (\"needs\" being defined in my case as: e-mail, texting, IM, Web/data...and, usually, just placing and taking calls wherever I happen to be...yes, a phone!). \"A tool, not a toy\" has long been my mantra.That changed a bit when I discovered that the BlackBerry platform doesn't play well with IMAP-based e-mail. I discovered this when I moved to a Gmail account and wanted to take advantage of IMAP's features. (I won't delve into the niceties of IMAP here, so at the risk of sounding rude, Just Bleeping Google It.) The long and short of it is that RIM was of no help to me, and the problem was beyond the realm of my cellular carrier (Boost Mobile). I wanted to stick with my carrier, but what was I going to do?I'd taken a glance at various Android phones for the better part of a year. Found nothing compelling, and all the phones seemed to cost at least a bit more than I was willing to shell out at a given time. I didn't care a lot about having the biggest screen or the highest resolution; nice as those are, I'd just be paying for stuff that didn't matter much in the main. I *did* care a bunch about e-mail, and it made sense that since Google was responsible for both the Android OS *and* Gmail, it was a no-brainer that the two would meld quite well. But I decided to sit on the fence and suffer quietly with my Curve. (Someone told me \"Hey, you can just access Gmail from your 'Berry's browser, right?\" Right, except that, if you know anything about the BlackBerry, you also know that doing this totally negates the main reason for sticking with the platform in the first place.)Along comes the Hydro. The \"killer app\" for me in this phone's specs wasn't an app at all: this phone was spec'd as watertight, at least down to a meter in water. I've killed at least one phone by drowning, and I'm generally a LOT more careful handling my phones than most people I've observed. This feature alone could overshadow shortcomings such as a lack of 4G or a humongous, max-res screen. It means I can whip the thing out in a driving thunderstorm (or, less dramatically, in the middle of taking a shower), and not fear subjecting the phone to a premature death. It simply makes the phone *useful* in more situations, and under more (and more adverse) conditions than other smartphones...in this case more than almost *any* other smartphone you can name.Meanwhile: The Hydro is pleasantly light, by way of casing that's entirely plastic. It doesn't have the \"sexy\" heft or look as a phone with metal wrapping around it, but I'll take light weight (with some structural integrity) over \"sexy\" (which is subjective, anyway) any day of the week. I will say the Hydro is anything but an eyesore: the worst you might say about it is that it looks somewhat ordinary. Hardly a sin in my mind.The screen is of decent size, and moderate in resolution, yet quite legible; Web pages come up with reasonable contrast and color, and page downloading, while not lightning-quick, is certainly fast enough for general purposes. Brightness is adjusted automatically based on ambient lighting conditions.The touch-screen interface is pleasant to use. Note that the Hydro does have off-screen touch-controls at the phone's bottom, even though the latest iterations of the Android OS have largely done away with the need for such ancillary controls. They seem to work well.And, speaking of the OS: the Hydro comes loaded with Android 4.0.4 (code-named Ice Cream Sandwich...I rather like that name). My exposure to previous iterations of Android have been somewhat limited, but I can say that the overall \"feel\" of the OS is pleasantly smooth and responsive, and the downloading, launching and moving-around of apps exposed nothing in the way of untoward behavior thus far.And, those apps...well over half a million so far. Still a fair count behind the iPhone, but as something of an Apple fanboy myself I can tell you that the Android platform has moved well past the \"just a contender among many\" stage and swinging it's weight just fine, thank you.As I said, no 4G here...but there's 3G, which does the job rather well (this in spite of Sprint's somewhat-spotty rep in terms of 3G network performance), and wi-fi, and Bluetooth, as well as wi-fi hotspot capability. BT pairing with my Motorola HX-1 headset was painless, although getting the phone to play nice with my Apple AirPort Extreme took a little doing. (Hint: If you haven't done it in a while, check your wireless router for software/firmware updates, and download/install them when available. If not, simply restart the router...that often does the trick.) Overall reception was somewhat better than my BlackBerry Curve 8530, but as the saying goes, YMMV.)(9/29/12 Addendum): I recently purchased a BlueAnt T1 Bluetooth headset to try out with the Hydro: so far, so good, although one problem I discovered with both headsets is that the voice-dial command voice from the phone - the voice that says \"speak now\", among other things - is rather low in volume, with no means of adjustment by the user. I've contacted Kyocera about this, since it appears to be an issue with the Voice-Dial app, not the phone itself, and I've been told a fix is in the works. Hardly a deal-breaker IMO, but the fix will make an already pretty-solid phone superb.Then there's the price: almost silly-cheap. If you're already using a BlackBerry on Boost, you're in for a treat: normally, buying the phone in-person entails an extra charge for set-up and such; In my case, they simply sold me the phone, transferred my account and had me set up in minutes, no extra charge. Couldn't be happier.(9/29/12 Addendum): One other \"bonus\" to not having stuff like 4G or a large, max-res screen is battery life: I've typically gone for over seven hours, utilizing the phone's various functions, and managed to run the battery down to about 25% or so of remaining capacity - rather good stats, compared to most razzle-dazzle phones out out there. Kyocera's included Eco app helps out here.Proverbial Bottom Line: if you value function over sheer entertainment value, I can safely say Kyocera's Hydro packs quite a bit of value for the bucks. Don't let the \"entry-level\" remarks of upcoming reviews scare you off: unless you *have* to have big-screen bling or that sexy silver band to wrap your anxious hands around, I'd say this phone rocks hard enough in its own quiet way. And when you and your friends are stuck in the rain and someone needs to call a car service to save the day, *you* get to play DareDevil without worry.(UPDATE 02/04/13 - Six Months Out): So far, no major surprises...there have been a few app-related glitches here and there, but nothing especially aggravating. Kyocera just released a firmware/software upgrade which I installed today; So far, the most I can detect is a mild kick in speed, similar to when I've performed firmware upgrades in computers and such. It's taken some rain, some snow, and a few drops to the floor - in and out of the case I bought for it - and it's hanging tough.(UPDATE 07/27/13) - Goodness, nearly a year out, practically a lifetime in cellular terms. Here's what's happened since my last update:- App Madness: My Hydro went a little nuts for the better part of a week, without much explanation, at least at first - slug-slow response, frequent restarts...the usual stuff a number of people have slagged the phone for before. After some sleuthing, it turned out that an update for one app, plus the addition of another app had done the phone in: removing said apps brought things back to normal. Moral: whatever phone you buy, if it starts going buggy after a few months, check your apps before blaming the phone itself.- Bent Reception: Shortly after this little misadventure, I had a week where my phone reception at home became close to nonexistent - calls and text messages were getting through sporadically at best. Since this is my main phone, I couldn't have that. A quick call to Boost cleared up the mystery: a Sprint cellular tower in my area had apparently collapsed, screwing up service for a lot of people, but they were on top of things and would have service restored quickly. Which they did.- Right this moment, I'm holding the new Hydro EDGE, the Hydro's apparent replacement. All I'll say for now is that, save for 4G LTE (nope, still doesn't have it, but I can deal), it appears to be, on paper, a sizable upgrade all-around: dual-core processor, slightly bigger screen (now behind \"impact-resistant\" glass), upgraded camera (5MP with autofocus, plus 720p hi-def video), Kyocera's unique Smart Sonic Receiver, essentially a form of bone-conduction technology that allows you to hear your caller's voice under quite noisy conditions, et cetera, et cetera. Is it any good? Stay tuned...and beware of reviews from people who've owned theirs for less than a week. :-)", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "First smart phone and I LOVE it!", "Author": "636lover", "ReviewID": "R1R1LFEQ1BB4OH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was using the crappy Motorola Theory before (Yuk!) I'm a nursing student and my instructors post important documents/announcements on the school website and texting us when we have to meet at the hospital so when I started searching for a phone I knew I NEEDED one that I could forward my school email to, access the school's websites (the full page, not the terrible mobile version,) plus I was in the market for a recorder to record lectures.  After doing EXTENSIVE research on multiple sites I bought the Kyocera Hydro on December 8, 2012. It is now 3/18/2013 and I'm still quite happy with my Hydro!BODY: The body of the phone itself is sleek, black, with a rough texture on the back cover. It is also (like every other cell phone) SLIPPERY so buy a cover/case! I will never understand all the reviews I read before buying that complained about the way the phone LOOKS. Who gives a flying crap when the majority of the original phone will be covered?! I bought a nice bright rubbery green cover and the phone is well protected. The Screen is a nice size, bright and colorful. I can see plenty when visiting websites and it is always responsive.STURDINESS: The phone is very sturdy. The plastic doesn't feel flimsy or cheap. The back cover locks securely, has never come undone on it's own or anything like that and it doesn't feel too light or fragile (not too heavy either) I've dropped it a few times and it has weathered all my clumsiness with good cheer. Yes I have experimentally dunked it in water (a few times!) after being OCD about making sure the back cover and usb port were covered, and the phone is perfectly fine. It amazed my friends, though at first they thought I had lost my mind. I have also used it in the rain while walking across campus and I use it in the shower everyday to listen to music. Yay!CALLS/SPEAKER QUALITY: I have never had a problem with anyone hearing me during calls and I always hear them loud and clear. The speaker phone is lovely and no one has complained or even seemed to notice if I switch between normal and speaker (On an old phone I had, the speaker phone sounded staticky.) During calls the screen and white buttons on the front cycle through lighting up and turning off, saving battery life yet still allowing access to the dial pad/speakerphone buttons onscreen and the other apps/features on the phone. Since this is my first smart phone I was uneasy the 1st time I tried ending a call by closing the app only to realize I could still hear the other person. Yes you can just hit \"End call\" but I prefer a physical button. (I mean, what if I want to talk badly about them as soon as I hang up?) Just kidding! This was easily remedied by going into System Settings/Accessibility/ and choosing \"Power button ends calls.\"  Music plays loud and clear through both headphones and speaker phone and I think it's nice that if I'm listening to music through headphones and they accidentally pull out of the jack, the music will not continue to play out loud. Might not seem like a big deal but it saves you some embarrassment when listening in the library or before a test in a quiet class room. I have no real complaints about the Google Play Music App that comes with the phone except sometimes it'll start to play a song and it sounds all fuzzy. I just press back and then forward to restart the song and it plays fine. Weird, but doesn't happen often.TEXT MESSAGING/MAIL: I was worried to hear that companies are shifting away from physical keyboards since I didn't have a great experience with my last touch screen phone (Samsung Solstice.) I'm a woman and even with my small hands everything ended up misspelled but the Hydro squashed all those fears.I love the SWYPE keyboard that comes with the phone, very neat. Doesn't take long to get used to (look for demo vids on Youtube.) I DO hate the way messaging displays the message I'm composing: I send long texts and no matter how long it is, your message is scrunched into this tiny box at the bottom (with the rest of the conversation shown above) and isn't fully displayed at \"real size\" until you send it (WTF?) so you have to scroll back through and carefully proofread before sending. It does improve when turning the phone on it's side to type, you see the whole thing.CAMERA: I've used the camera to take quick shots to post on facebook. It could be user error but I dislike how every pic seems to come out looking dull and dark, and flash seems to make no difference at least when it's displayed on the phone. When you first take a pic it looks fine but once it moves to the \"Gallery\" it seems to go dull and dark. BUT!: I might need to play with it more because the pics I posted on facebook look fine and true to their original colors(?)MISC: The alarm is great, easy to set up and I haven't run into a limit for how many you can have. I have 5 right now.You can press the little microphone icon to enter text or search terms by speaking into the phone and I AM IMPRESSED. I have even searched for complex medical terms while doing homework and it has \"heard\" me accurately every time!WIFI: I'm able to pick up a signal everywhere so far and I've had data and calls (clear) go through even with only the tiniest bar showing (of course it's slower.) I don't like that if I turn off the WIFI manually in Settings the phone will \"restart,\" turning off and turning back on again. That might just be how these phones work and it only takes a few seconds but it's annoying. Happens rarely though; I only turn it off when the phone is determined to use the weak WIFI signal nearby and I tire of waiting for it to give up and switch to the Boost network.BATTERY LIFE: Smart phones usually eat batteries for breakfast. The Hydro isn't bad though; it comes with an Eco Mode app which is helpful and you can search for lots of other power-saving apps. I can go about 1 full day without charging it if I don't use the phone AT ALL. With normal use (music, checking email, surf a little internet) I charge it once a day. I can record a 5 hour lecture and it doesn't use much battery. I have gotten to school an hour before lecture, with only 25% battery, hooked it up to my laptop (the usb cord comes with the phone)  and managed to get it up to around 40-50% charged in 20-30 minutes. Biggest tip: Turn off Facebook's auto updating/ sync. It's a battery killer! The phone shows you in Settings which apps have been using the most battery in the past, what's running now etc.Sorry it's so long but these were some of the concerns I had and couldn't find the answers to when I was searching.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the money", "Author": "R. T. Mudge", "ReviewID": "R1M4AUU0VYZW6K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I researched pre-paid phones for about 2 months before I bit the bullet and made my purchase.  I knew I wanted an android and I was torn between the Kyocera Rise and Hydro.  I went with the Hydro purely because of Boost's shrinking monthly plans.  After having the phone for 2 1/2 weeks I feel ready to share my opinion on how excited this phone makes me.My biggest complaint about the Hydro is battery life purely because I'm always on the go, HOWEVER you must realize that any smartphone is always \"thinking\" checking your email, facebook, and everything else you have directly linked to it.  So my solution was to keep a charger in my bag and I charge it when I'm at work and in the car.It is surprisingly fast even on the network.  The processor works quicker than I expected.  The reviews on cnet said it was slow for the processor it had.I haven't tested the water resistance yet purely because if it does happen I don't have proper insurance to back it up.  I did get a 1 year best buy protection plan on it though for just in case.All in all I have a great inexpensive phone that does everything I need without the hassle of a contract.  I would gladly recommend this to any person.****Editing to note******I have tested the water resistant feature.  It is water resistant.  I dropped in the foot bath while I was getting a pedicure, the lady was driving me crazy telling me to be careful, so I dropped it to shut her up.  I've put it in a pitcher of water to show my co-workers it is water resistant.The touchscreen is VERY touchy.  I do frequently mute calls while I'm talking, solution, use a blue tooth headset.Certain apps are NOT compatible with this model, so I got over it and didn't download them.****EDITING AGAIN TO NOTE******The water resistant feature does work, however, if the speaker gets saturated you have to wait for it to dry out or you can't hear your phone calls for approximately 24 hours.  It doesn't effect the working order of the phone the speaker just needs time to dry out before you can hear or it sounds really muffled.  Again, if you use a blue tooth headset this doesn't apply to you.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible phone, do not buy!", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R3RQO8BMWNFJ35", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone and figured with a quality name brand it would be good.

It totally works & goes against all my mental training over the past 10 years on how to treat a phone.

Could use a bigger battery pack. It is not 4G it is 3G. Could use a 5 meg camera. You can have these things if you want to spend a lot more money on another phone. After using this phone for sometime now i have retired my other android phone and it cost a lot more than this phone did (over twice as much). I can't think of much this phone won't do. They say it is water proof but i haven't tested it ( such as dropping it in a glass of water, and don't think i will do that either) out but did get caught outside in a downpour in my power chair on the way back from the store and it got wet sitting in the pouch on my chair. No problem so far. The speech recognition is excellent on this phone. Here is something i really liked. I was going fishing but i am new to where i live now so i just asked the navigation system to tell me where all the bait stores were close to me. It listed them all and then when i chose one it setup the route to follow to get there and it worked like a charm.It would be impossible to tell you everything this phone will do. I downloaded a manual off the net and it is 175 pages long on what you can do with this phone. The boost manual only shows you the basics and their website has a on hands tutorial but believe me it is only a small part of all the things this phone can do.Update 5/9/2013. People listen up! I bought this phone March 22nd 2013. Company says the phone is water resistance not water proof. Well April 2nd i was out fishing in my power chair. We have a SALT water river that runs though our property where i live. I was right at the edge of the bank and the water is about two feet deep there. I was talking on this phone and when i was though i went to put it back in my pouch on my power chair but fumbled and dropped the phone. As Murfeys law would have it, it fell on the arm rest and bounce off of it, and YES fell in the salt water. I could see it but it is a concrete bank six feet above the water. I had to drive my power chair back to my apartment get my long fishing net to try to retrieve it. I retrieve it and took it to my apartment. Since i thought i couldn't do it any harm i figure i would just put it in a sink full of fresh water. When it fell in the water it was still turned on but i shut if off after i retrieved it. I dried the phone off as well as i could and took the battery out to dry it. Much to my surprise there was no water in the battery compartment. I dried off the outside of the phone the best i could and let it sit overnight without using it. The next day i turned it on and to my amazement it came on. I have been using it since April 3rd (over a month) and it is still working fine. HYDRO FOREVER!

Now it's completely dead :( I went hiking with it and took amazing pictures of the waterfall with it. Sad to say it is now completely dead :( water got into it somehow and no longer works.

But here are a few points so far:-  Even as just an Android 4.0 Media player this is a good value, which is my primary purpose of this phone-  Wifi download maintains good speed. I have run netflix movies and youtube videos with no issue-  Game such as temple run work very well-  Video quality on Netflix is good-  Even though it is plastic, it feels well built-  Google play and wifi work without activation on boostI have not been able to evaluate battery life yet.  I have not made a call.  When you consider that a 2gb Ipod shuffle costs $40 with a fraction of the functionality of this phone I think this is a real value.Update:  I have added Goove IP along with google voice to make this a free VOIP phone with its own phone number.  It works very well.  I have also added many apps and loaded it with music.  This makes and exceptional MP3 player with good audio quality (the speaker on it is amazingly loud).  I have tried at least a dozen games and all of them work very well.  I combined it with the \"Kyocera Hydro C5170 Boost Mobile Hybrid Double Layer Skin Case, Perforated Armor (Black / Red)\" from Amazon which cost $4.75 shipped.  This makes this phone feel indestructable.Update: 1/28 - My son loves this thing.  He plays games and music on it every day.  The battery life seems very good, but it runs in airplane mode with wifi only, so I do not know what it would be like on a cellular network.  When he goes out with me I turn on the wifi on my cell so he can connect and have his VOIP phone.  He has loaded it up with music (I put in a 16GB microSD card) and he has put over a dozen games on it as well.  No regrets on this purchase.Update 4/29 - Power button broke.  You need to hit the power button to wake up the phone.  It is supposed to have a 1 yr warranty.  My son is going to try customer service today.

Since I wanted her to focus on the product rather than the logo, I asked her what she thought a good MP3 player would be like. The key features she listed were:1) Easy to load music2) Touch screen interface3) Supports apps4) WiFi5) Camera6) Built in speakerAfter looking through countless cheap (in every sense of the word) IPod alternatives, all of which were very poorly reviewed, it struck me that smartphones have all of these capabilities. Not only that, some of them are way less expensive than an IPod (even a used one). Since there's no law that you have to sign up for cell phone service just because the device is cell-capable, I dove back in to see what I could find as an \"IPod alternative\" in the cell phone market.After a little more searching I turned up the Hydro. It was well within my daughter's price range and, when I explained to her that it was also waterproof (but, unfortunately, lacked a built in FM tuner) she was willing to give it a shot. For my part, I liked the idea that it also gave her the ability to make an emergency phone call if she ever needs it.My daughter has had her Hydro for three months now and her response has been overwhelmingly positive. She has pride of ownership because it was inexpensive enough she could buy it with her own money. We never signed up for a cell phone plan but she has been able to do everything she wanted to (except, of course, make phone calls) using WiFi. She uses the camera quite a bit and is very happy with it. She especially enjoy's taking \"art\" shots that involve partial submersion in water or water spraying (something her friends can't do). She also likes the fact that, when her \"MP3 player\" gets dirty, she can just wash it off in the sink. She has found that the Hydro is very durable (something that concerned me when it arrived because, frankly, it feels pretty plastic), having survived several drops onto hard surfaces and, at least once that I know of, having been thrown out of a tree (she's a very active tween!). She uses a variety of apps including texting and games on a daily basis and overall has found the Hydro to be reasonably stable, although there have been occasional glitches. She loads music without problems and has adequate room on her SD card for both her apps and music. The speaker doesn't exactly rock the house but it does make noise. I think she has even found an alternative to the FM tuner (possibly using Pandora?).So, to summarize, I know that the Hydro is nominally a smartPHONE but, for my daughter, it has really been a great little MP3 player. It has a lot more features than she could have gotten in this price range in a \"normal\" MP3 player and, when we decide that she is ready for a cell phone of her own, it will be easy to turn on service.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "thestone", "ReviewID": "R3GF6OSOYDQG2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got the phone for about a month now and i am more than pleased.

Before I purchased it, I did research, reviews on YouTube, amazon and this site. Almost everyone says it's a great phone. For $100, it better be. I thought it was gonna be the perfect upgrade from my Rumor Reflex. The hydro is a nice size with no front camera.The first week it was giving me problems. The screen would freeze constantly to where I would have to take the battery out. It was an annoying clicking sound (sounds like someone texting in my ear) during calls. This was just the first week. Second week, the phone would not let me call out; kept saying application call failed. The touchscreen when taking a phone call is very sensitive and ends up clicking over where the person on the other end is wondering did you hang up. Sometimes, when I play music, the speaker is staticty and sounds horrible. I was through with this phone. I called the mobile store that I got it from, and they told me they couldn't me a refund or an exchange because I didn't have insurance on the phone. I feel like I got a lemon and I can't make lemonade with it. I got the insurance and I plan on exchanging it for a new phone. I had to factory reset the phone like 8 times in order to fix problems and spent alot of time re downloading apps. Apps like Snapchat and BeFunky are not compatible with this phone. The good about this phone is the waterproof technology. I touch it with wet fingers all the time, even dropped it in the dishwater (on purpose), and it works like a charm.

A 45 minute phone call will really put the hurt on your battery, not to mention leaving your wi-fi and mobile data connections on. Even with the Eco setting on full all the time, with regular use you can only expect maybe 5 or 6 hours of use before you have to put it on the charger. On the bright side, it does seem to charge quickly if you're using the wall-charger. This phone is fine if you've got a way to charge it in the car and when you're at home. I would be wary though if you're someone who tends to forget your charger a lot. Boost Mobile? I got to give it a \"meh\" for the Albuquerque area at least. The Sprint network has zero 4G support in ABQ which really bites when you're trying to jam out to Pandora while you're driving and it constantly skips or cuts out.

What, do you wear a watch and carry a camera too? This phone the reason why.When using an auxiliary cord in the car (Which is all I've done for the past 10 years without issue) the music will pause randomly.I don't mean once every few songs. It will put you through a battle of wills in which you press play, and it pauses again ad-infinitum.Because of this phone, I'm stuck to CD's - and god forbid local radio. I forgot those even still existed. This phone has set me back 10 years.As a Text machine: FAILI just sent my boyfriend an \"I love you\" text, oh, no, it slipped into spanish and it says \"I llove' tupi\" I just tried to text him, in English,\"I hate my phone\" And it said \"I haste this Phoebe\"It takes twice the concentration, both to type accurately, and check for when it decides to change what you typed to a word from the 14th century. (The great \"Thou\" instead of \"You\" war still rages on\")  I went from a blackberry with a qwerty keyboard that I could type on faster than I can talk out loud, to the equivalent of a caveman chiseling into the side of a stone surface.I now only reply to people when it's worth taking the time to struggle with it. I am a text-hermit, and forget facebook, It will make \"thou\" look like an idiot publicly.As a phone: FAILI never use the phone anyway, because I WAS a texter.First of all this phone makes more calls than I do, and when it does it closes out the screen so I have to re-open to end the call. My friends get a lot of \"Dam**t where is it, F*** I hate this piece of\" *click* calls.The few joyous times a week I call my grandma though, it manages to mute on her, close out, and make it impossible to find the screen again to un mute or end the call.If you're calling a company, The \"dial pad\" is accessed by pushing a button. So if you want to enter say an account number, you have to pull your phone away, wait 3 seconds for it to light back up (It goes black when you have it to your face) and then press the button for dialpad, and then type. If you're like me you put the phone back to your ear then pull it away and look at it again, like 6 times... and you have to wait for it to light up and to open the dialpad again...My bank hangs up on me a lot these days, so does my grandma.As a Camera: FAILmy instagram misses me.As a gaming device: DECENTI got to admit the touch screen is cool, and minecraft mobile is addicting to no end, my phone is a glorified minecraft machine.As a floater in the toilet: PASSI did drop it in the toilet once, and after a though sanitation session it booted up like a champ.BOTTOM LINE:You see some great reviews - by people who have never owned a smart phone. I'm sure it's very impressive and shiny like the first wheel was to cavemen but this phone takes every basic function older phones have, and makes them difficult as s*** to use.

Oh it comes with GPS too!The only complaints I have is the battery life seems a bit light, makes it through the day, but definitely needs to be charged each night.

I was excited to try it out but from the get-go I was frustrated and disappointed.  My first impression was that the phone felt extremely light, fragile and \"cheap.\"  I supposed this was due to its being water-proof (plastic over metal casing).  On the first day of using it I was tapping through the menu and the phone suddenly turned itself off without any warning.  When it came back on it had forgotten my Mobile ID and took some time to reorient itself to my settings and account, which was annoying.  I had problems with hanging up on people or accidentally putting them on hold by touching the screen with my cheek during calls.  I tried adjusting the \"proximity sensor\" but that didn't help.  It was straight out of a commercial - I was trying to call my grandmother to tell her my sister had her baby: first I put her on hold, then the phone disconnected us twice.  IRRITATING!  I didn't like the touch screen's responsiveness and the battery died exceedingly quickly.  Finally, after about 5 days the screen started doing this thing where, following the end of a call, it would go black and not turn back on.  The phone was still on - I could press the volume button and hear it beep but nothing would bring it back - not even holding down the power button.  I took it back to Boost Mobile and she did a hard reboot which deleted all of my settings and data.  They asked me to give the phone one more day without any apps.  It continued doing the same stuff (screen going black and not coming back on without removing the battery).  It would do another variation where the screen would turn black when I was using the menu and I'd frequently have to press the power button to bring the screen back up.  Thankfully my Boost Mobile store allowed me to return the phone even though it had been 8 days.  I paid $20 to upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy Rush which I LOVE so far.  It's amazing how much better that phone is in every way.  Based on my experience of the Kyocera Hydro I would NOT recommend it.

For $100, I figured it wouldn't be anything great, but wouldn't be horrible either.  I was wrong.  The design is non-intuitive and flawed.  The placement of the power button is such that it's almost impossible not to hit the volume button when you're trying to flash the phone from sleep. The touchscreen is intermittently responsive; at some points requiring multiple attempts to  press an icon before it will launch the app, or when typing with the keyboard (Swype comes stock), typing a character on the keyboard 4 or 5 times, and then it will either \"catch up\" and type 5 of the same character, or it simply inserts the wrong one. The battery life is worse than any phone I've ever had, and I'm not a heavy user of graphic intensive apps or multimedia.  The Boost network (aka Sprint) is just plain bad. Every call I have been on for longer than a few minutes has dropped due to \"fading signal\".

Just dont expect to watch youtube videos in it (unless you have wifi)2b. Speaking of wifi. This has good wifi reception as well. i was able to get wifi signal thoughout the house with no problem.3. The \"waterproof\" live up to it's hype. I've been using it as my mp3 player while I'm swimming in the pool. You just have to buy those waterproof earphones.4. The touchscreen does NOT work when under water. So don't expect to use this as underwater camera.5. The camera itself takes grainy pictures in low light. the flash doesnt help much unless the subject is within 3 feet or less. But for an entry-level with 3.5 megapixel camera, it's still good enough that you can post the pics in facebook, or instagram.7. The battery life did surprise me also.

My first smartphone ceased to work after I laid it down in a small puddle of water (the kind produced by a cold can of soda on a hot summer day.) Because of my clumsy nature I had resigned my self to buying used on Craigslist. I bought another Prevail, although it was beat up and worse for the wear,it almost withstood me an entire year. (I drop my phone, typically with the charger still connected, on an average of 5 times a week. I first saw the Kyocera Hydro inside my local Boost Mobile store. The fact that the phone is waterproof immediately drew my attention. However, I was concerned about the price tag. I was thrilled when I found the Hydro on Amazon for 40% less than everywhere else I shopped. So far, the Hydro has exceeded my expectations. Within the first 2 days of owning the Hydro,  I have dropped it on concrete twice. There isn't a scratch on it! The tough plastic screen is more resilient than the glass screen some other phones have. While the phone is sturdy and durable, it isn't heavy or bulky. The  3.5 inch touchscreen is brighter and seems to offer more user space than the comparable Samsung Prevail. The onscreen keyboard is intuitive and intelligent. Unlike the Prevail's keyboard, the Hydro's keyboard doesn't prevent me from being able to fill in username and password boxes on the Internet. The 1ghz  snapdragon processor makes 3G feel like 4G. The speakers and music player are of decent quality. (Loud enough to wake me up with an alarm in the morning) I couldn't say the same for my Prevail. I'm thrilled to finally have a flash accompany the camera. Finally, I live in a basement and had become accustomed to dropped calls. Despite having the same carrier;plan; and number, my Hydro hasn't dropped a call yet! Switching my number from my old phone to my new took less than 10 minutes and completly free. I love this phone and would recommend it to anyone that needs a rugid phone that is as affordable and dependable as it is snappy. Oh yeah, did I mention it is waterproof up to a meter!

That being said even at $80 this phone is fine. The only thing keeping me from changing to another phone is that I ride motorcycles so I like that I can call anyone in case I need to and it won't matter if it's raining. It is a great relief to have the ability to talk to someone when it's raining and since I live in Florida, that is a huge plus. Now to the phone. Coming from the HTC 3D, this phone took some getting used to due to slowness. I do put apps into my SD, have Juicedefender app, and have Task killer, which I am constantly pressing to clear any background apps.The battery could be better, if you are a constant talker look somewhere else because this phone will suck the battery but call quality is perfect. It's small, compact, lightweight, and waterproof. At the end of the day, I am looking for a phone to call, not waste my time playing Angry Birds or any of the like. It has GPS ability so it gets me to where I need to go with little to no problem and that's fine. I can mount it on my motorcycle and even if its raining, I can still follow Scout GPS. That's fricken' awesome. At $50 it's a steal, at $80, it's decent.Note: I have tried the Hydro Edge prior to the Hydro, it was downright terrible. While it is faster, I can barely hear the other person on the line and what's the point of having a phone (albeit faster) if I can't make out any words? Returned it, and bought the hydro. Stayed with it for about 5 months now.* The reason why I am not recommending it is that most people are looking for long battery with super blazing fast processing and high def screens. This phone is NONE of that. BUT if you are like me who uses a phone like a phone and uses the data stuff when needed then by all means buy the phone because let me tell you, it's hilarious seeing other peoples confused faces when I'm talking to someone and it is straight up pouring outside.

After contacting Kyocera (I did receive a prompt reply via email) tried adjusting the \"safety\" (weird nomenclature for this setting) and it's still way too sensitive to use as a phone.  Everything else on the phone was fine, UNTIL yesterday.  Now the on/off button is failing making the phone unusable (I've since read this seems to be somewhat common). It's really too bad, if it weren't for these two issues I'd think this phone was ok.  Good for everything, EXCEPT making calls, if it lasts!  I didn't test the waterproofness - and have no confidence that even is due to the quality.Also, does not scan barcodes, only QR codes.Update:  I contacted Kyocera and was advised to send my phone in to their repair facility in NY.

If not, I'm going to have to just buy another phone and right off the $70 I paid to use it for less than 2 mos., and it never worked properly from the get-go.Update:  06/18/2013 - This is an awful phone for making phone calls!  I still keep cutting people off because the proximity sensor doesn't work properly,.  I either mute them, or the screen changes and they can't here me.  I am so tired of hearing, \"Are You there?\"  You must sit perfectly still when using the phone.  I cannot wait to buy another phone.  I think all they did was repair the on/off button.

My $55/month has dropped to $50 month an in another 4 months will drop to $45 a month for unlimited everything. I love the small size of this phone--not much of a problem because the AI when speaking to convert speech to text is pretty good. Sleek geeky color scheme including backside which is a texttured grunge black. single core gives it good battery life-- and i just plug it in to charge when i home and look at it as a land line at home and then unplug it and use it all day out and about. I use Amazon for getting my android apps, I just prefer to stay off all things Google, but when you first start the phone upon buying it Google will of course want you to sign up with a Google account; your choice, google or amazon or you could also just find android apps (.apk) on the web but then you take your changes they might have malware embedded in them.

In this case, being a bit of a Scotsman has paid off rather handsomely, and the Hydro has rather impressed me during the few months I've had it.What I like about the Hydro:*The touchscreen interface is smooth and intuitive, proving very easy to master, and the Android OS is a sweet runner too.*The screen, while not the biggest or fanciest one out there, is adequate for just about anything you could want to do, from watching videos to reading to the odd game of Pacman, and I found it crisp and sharp.*The overall size of the phone lends to it being held easily in one's hand, and it fits nicely in one's pockets.*The sound is crisp and clear, and plenty loud enough. The headphone jack is a standard one, so you don't have to go buying a special pair, which earns solid bonus points from me.*While not a hardcore gaming or app machine, this phone has done splendidly with what few games I have run, mostly retro emulations of things like Super Mario Bros. On the app side, this phone has run practically everything I've tried well (Weaphones and Weaphones WW2 are real crowd-pleasers).*The data speed, while only 3G, is speedy enough for my tastes, and it certainly beats dial-up or bumming a WiFi connection from your neighbor.Speaking of WiFi, the Hydro is Wifi capable, which saves on your data usage(more on that later).*Waterproof. Haven't really wanted to test this, but so far my Hydro has stood up to being used in the rain to call a ride or talk to the family.*The Camera. Again, not the grandest thing in the world, but it takes splendid photos and good video*The Price. 60 odd bucks is one helluva bargain when compared to most other smart phones in the Boost Range.Things I don't like about the Hydro:*The Plan. Pretty well the only thing I take issue with is the plan. While it has unlimited everything, has a data cap of 2.5GB a month, after you exceed that your data will be throttled and slowed down. I am glad that they don't cut it off completely, but it does bug me...If you use your WiFi, this problem can be mitigated somewhat, and considering that the plan shrinks from $55 down to $40 a month, this isn't too much of an issue.Conclusion:I'm firmly of the belief in having a tool, not a toy, when it comes to technology, and the Hydro certainly fills that bill, and with a few added apps such as Flashlight and Swiss Army Knife, the Hydro is made even more useful, and I find it a worthy addition to the tool belt, both at work on the farm and for fooling around on the couch.If you're looking for an affordable Android phone with nice functionality and a plan that won't hurt your wallet, this one's worth considering.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Simple Cheap Waterproof Smartphone", "Author": "Eric R", "ReviewID": "R1B4XJPOWYXC02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many of my Amazon purchases, I purchased this on a lightning deal for $40 to serve as my work phone.

I turned it back on. The back (which it slid down the roof on) was a little scratched up. The screen didn't shatter or break. Two months (MONTHS) later, a possibly unrelated failure of the power button to push in led me to get an insurance replacement. I'm not saying that your phone will survive a fall off of the roof, but mine did. I doubt an iphone would have.Low power/performance:I find that it doesn't have the RAM to handle things like checking email while you're getting directions. Recent updates to the phone and google/Android stuff have left my phone in a continual state of program crashing. I'm hoping to do a factory reset in a few days, after I back up all my data.

The hydro is not only durable and reliable, but attractive as well.Needs Improvement: Battery life for the Hydro is mediocre - this phone drains quick, so be ready to charge it all the time. Contains bloatware and many programs working in the background - battery still degrades even if unnecessary programs are removed from the background.Tiebreaker: For others, the camera 3.2 MP might be a misfortune. The processor is not intended for gaming.

J McCartin", "ReviewID": "R1UFNI047TA0QI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is certainly not the greatest and fanciest android phone out there but for the price it's certainly no dog either.  Ice Cream Sandwich (android 4) requires a minimum 1ghz cpu, so some might tell you it's a bit under powered for the OS but I find it snappy enough.  The biggest draw to this phone for me was the water proof feature, I ride my bike a lot and have been caught in downpours too many times to count. Before I got this phone, I was always afraid the phone was going to get soaked and ruined; don't have to worry about that here.  I've had the phone about two months, generally happy but android is a learning curve if you're coming from windows mobile like my old phone.I dumped t-mobile after years of service because they've turned money hungry since the failed AT&T; buyout. The boost unlimited service is a better deal and the coverage is just as good from what I've been told by happy customers. Android is just like any other operating system, it gets clogged up with junk if you put on and take off a lot of programs and files.  The included eco mode doesn't work real well in my opinion, so one of the first things I downloaded on the phone was a battery saver app.The google store is so easy to deal with and you don't even have to order apps from the phone you can do it from your desk top. Boost has been good about updates but I had a problem with a recent major update from Kyocera it just would not come all the way down, boost apparently had lots of complaints. Probably due to this firmware download refusing to come down all the way (thus creating a corrupted file) I suddenly couldn't call out one day, phone said the phone app had \"stopped\" which is just a nice way of saying \"crashed\" or if you're a windows geek it BSOD'd. Boost helped me do a total wipe of the phone, reactivated it and helped me do system updates from their side etc. Got my ability to call out back and because google automatically backs up your contacts, calendars, and apps, it was really simple to re-install everything back onto the phone.  The apps, you have to tell those to re-install individually so if you suspect an app was causing your problem just don't re-install it.  I'm not sure exactly what Kyocera's major update was about but I'm suddenly having problems with my bluetooth.  I've read in a few places that this is not a unusual issue with Android, the bluetooth somehow gets broken either by a system update or some program that was installed. The bluetooth works but often drops with no warning and if it works at all I constantly have to repair or manually connect the devices.  The headset(s) are plantronics, generally a very dependable brand. I still think this may be getting caused by the battery saver app but I've taken those off and tried different ones and the problem still exists, tried a bluetooth fixer or two off google store but that doesn't seem to have fixed it either.I love the phone, for the price it's a great phone, plenty of memory, peppy, the waterproof is nice and the price is right.  Note, no 4G on this phone but I don't really do anything that uses all that speed anyway, 3G is fine for me.  As far as service goes I haven't had a problem with signal yet.  I only get one or two bars at home, I live on a heavily tree lined street and signals can be blocked by heavy foliage and I'm also on the top of a hill.  A new tower was put up down the street, boost must not be using that tower apparently.  Regardless haven't had a problem making calls even if I only have one bar.  I hope I can resolve this annoying issue with the bluetooth without reloading the phone again, getting ready to call Kyocera.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wi-fi", "Author": "Ray Burgess", "ReviewID": "RANFOSGYP2FZ6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Wi-Fi settings sucks on this phone, but other then that this phone is a pretty damn good phone to have", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Alexis", "ReviewID": "R35TMUC9LBUA8I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone isn't the best but I'm pleased.I'm not a heavy gamer.

The speaker is good. In order to save your battery life, I suggest you to buy advanced task killer from the market and use eco mode.Now there is some negative things.On instagram, it freezes. If it freezes, you have to take out the battery and put it back in. The screen is quite small to play games that need big screens like minecraft. The camera quality is not the best. It makes the shutter sound and you cant take it off. But you can download an app called CameraMX and it lets you take the sound off and put a timer (if you want). The only reason I mentioned the app and taking the shutter sound off is for in case you want to take a picture of someone off guard or take a picture in school or at work without getting caught lol.

I have used cell phones for over 18 years but have never mastered the technology before it became obsolete (which happens every 3 minutes or so...).  So, going from a Blackberry to Droid is a bit of a challenge... trackball replaced by a lot of flickin'.  I am still flickin' around with it and learning what it does.  There was a time when me and technology raced together at Le Mans,  now I'm more of a back seat passenger.That said, this phone coupled with Boost Mobile is Great!  Boost has its customer service issues, I usually get to speak with someone fairly quickly but, by the time my calls get handed off for the 5th time, they drop and nothing gets accomplished.  I tell you this because Boost emailed me that I could get a good deal on this phone as I was  \"already a Boost Customer, the Kyocera Hydro will cost you just $69 (instead of the $79 \"on sale\" price)\".  Called 3 times, got the runaround and every time by being transferred from one rep to another and each time the call quality degenerated until it dropped.  After the 3rd time - and 1 hour - trying to save $10 - I gave up.  But, just before placing the order at $79, I Googled the phone one more time, Amazon (among others) came up, clicked and found the phone for $49!For my needs and experience, I would highly recommend this phone when coupled with Boost.  This combination is the best value to service offered I could find (and I  LLLOOOOKKEEDDDDD a long time).  Boost offers UNLIMITED text, calls and data (yes, I checked with Boost, they said - \"unlimited calls, text and internet\", the \"internet\" translates to \"data\" ).  Only up to 3G technology but my area doesn't yet offer 4G so who cares?  I paid $49 for the phone and, with diminishing on-time monthly payments, now am paying $40/month and in 4 months I will be at $35.  Imagine, $35 a month using a cutting edge phone and getting more for your buck, and I ain't flickn' around 'bout that! No contract and the plan allows changing phones without having to restart diminishing program.  Actually, the BB plan was $5/month more so I even saved that!I am not assiciated with Boost other than being a customer and, if another combination of service, price and phone come along, I would give it a hard look.Back to reality... phone works GREAT.  Still on the learning curve and have urges to go back the BB but, as I keep at it I find it to be more versatile and capable.  The compatibility problem is mine as I have to learn how to flick.. the phone is not the problem, I just need to be patient.  I can't say it has better voice reception than the BB (was hoping for that, spotty in this neck the woods but the Wilson Signal Boost seems to have fixed that - see my review if interested), but it does seem to have better voice quality as well as  more reliable and faster Internet service.  Plenty to like as far as \u201cextras\u201d go... good camera, Ice Cream Droid, fairly easy to set up, etc.  Good screen size and quality.  And, as an ADDED BONUS, if you forget and go swimming with it... no problem, good down to about 10 feet (hence the name \u201cHydro\u201d).I haven't tested every phone on every service offered, but I don't need the best.

And truthfully I was looking at the Blackberry Curve from Boost instead of this. My friend has Boost, so I knew that's who I wanted to go with so no decision there. But again I would have had to order it online and wait and I needed a phone that day.But I will say is I'm not mad that I got this phone instead of the Boost Blackberry Curve. In fact. I think I kinda lucked out. This phone is great and I think I prefer it over the Blackberry. For it's price it's super loaded with features. I was super happy at what I got in my phone from boost for this money. This may in fact be the best phone I've ever had. It's way better than anything I have gotten anywhere else for a similar price, and I was with ATT as my cell carrier. $100.00 wouldn't buy this quality of phone from ATT without a binding, financially & emotionally draining 2 year contract. Even then I don't know if I would have gotten as good of a phone anywhere else even with a contract.Also Boost service has been nothing short of amazing. First I was paying almost $200.00 a month for cell service via ATT. Between needing data service, unlimited text, plus their service charges and taxes I felt like I needed vaseline to open my bill every month. With Boost I now pay under $60.00 a month total, and that should get down to around $40.00 a month eventually. To go further ATT wouldn't switch my number to Boost because of an account descrepency. Boost tech support went above and beyond and took several hours out of their day to try and get them to activate my old number so it could be ported and they got it done!Boost, so far has been amazing!

Apparently though the video recording software built into the above programs? and/or limits of the phones camera; results in footage that is too blurred when shooting moving gymnast, head of golf club, Tennis player etc.Have used an older IPad with ISwing and the recording's playback in slowmotion was NOT blurred much.  Again IPad has same megapixel camera specs as this phone and same Sport video Analysis products area vailable in both Android and Apple.Needed a new phone anyway, so will keep it but am very dissapointed not being able to use it for intended purpose.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth it :)", "Author": "Mayra", "ReviewID": "R3HKCE8GOI4E2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Definitely worth more than 30 dollars!!!

Its a good price, but now that i paid for it and the cover and such, its not worth it.

My first phone dropped a foot 1/2. The screen didn't make it. My second phones speaker just stops working when I plugged it in to charge. Now I can't hear people who call me.
