{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice Phone", "Author": "Artistic Deviant", "ReviewID": "R3GISG5I2A45A2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the LG KC910 Renoir - Unlocked QuadBand Cellular Phone - 8 MP Camera, GPS, WiFi, FM Radio - International Version with No Warranty for about a week, and it's been a relatively good experience. At first, there was a bit of a learning curve; however, in the end, I have decided that this is a great phone. The problems I encountered dealt with the charger I received, setting up the Internet, and the auto-lock feature.First, the charger. When I received the phone last week I discovered one fatal flaw with my purchase, the wall charger was made for charging this phone in another country (I'm in the US). Fortunately, you can charge your phone via a USB cable to your computer. I also ran into trouble with this, but as it turns out, I was using the wrong USB slot. The USB slot on the right only kept the phone alive (it wouldn't charge the battery); fortunately, the USB slot on the left would charge the phone. Whatever. You can easily find a wall charger for this phone at a retail store if you want.The auto-lock feature isn't a bad idea; sadly, it can be incredibly annoying. I suppose this was made to keep you from accidentally dialing 911 or something. But it doesn't really work right. The solution? Just turn it off; your touch screen will go into sleep mode when you're not using it, and it will not come on if you touch the screen. It will come on if you push one of the three buttons on the bottom of the phone. Still, it would be incredibly difficult to accidentally dial 911 or something even without the auto-lock feature. Unfortunately, if you have to call and push buttons on your phone during your conversation, then the auto-lock still comes on. You just have to push the auto-lock icon, and it will go away (at least for a while). I don't know if that part of the auto-lock system can be turned off. Strange, I know.Ah, the Internet settings. I'm using AT&T;, and transferring the sim card into this phone was easy. The phone immediately worked when it came to calling people. By the way, reception was great for me. I've read about people who said the call quality was lacking. I don't know about their experience, but I had no problems. Anyway, the Internet is the one part of the phone that wouldn't work. I finally stumbled upon how to do it the other day, and it works great now. Here's how I got the Internet to work:Phone Setting>Connectivity>Access Point: (Data Setting)Title: AttBearer: GPRSAuth: PAPUser: WAP@CINGULARGPRS.COM (all caps)Password: CINGULAR1 (ALL UPPERCASE)APN: wap.cingularBrowser>Settings>Profiles: (Internet Setting)Service Name: Media NetHomepage: [...]Connection mode: TCP without proxyIP: (blank)proxy: (blank)Security: (blank)Access Point: ATTI can't guarantee that the above code will work for you, but it's worth a shot.Other Thoughts -The camera phone is great (not dslr quality but good), the battery is okay, the touchscreen is decent, the eight gigabyte chip (microsdhc class 4) works well, sound quality is good, the included headphones are worthless; wifi works well. Is this phone an iPhone killer? Probably not, but it's definitely close.Week Two Update -It appears that the LG wall charger I bought at the retail store may have ruined my battery. It was exactly the same as the one that was sent with my phone, other than the fact that it works in the US instead of England. I managed to find another battery online, so hopefully this will correct the problem. It does seem that the battery I've been using has been problematic. I've only successfully charged it with the usb port on my computer, and that was tricky as well. So be careful when you charge this phone in the US.Final Update -The battery is working properly now. Not sure what happened but I wont be using that wall charger again. Everything else is good.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "cool phone ^_^", "Author": "tate \"tate\"", "ReviewID": "R1RYZ9ZCYMEMFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for three days now, and all i can say is...this phone is awsome!!! ^_^ this is much better than the viewty.. improved and i like the fact that it has wifi, puls 8 MP camera totally awsome...the video is cool it has three modes: normal, fastmode, and the slowmo (120fps)...for the camera, inorder to get a good performance and great quality for photos, different setting must be done...i just play with it and try different kinds of settings such as the white balance, ISO, Scene mode, etc..for the mp3...totally awsome, i must say DOLBY, great quality...i am not sure whats the max for the memory..i have 4 gb micro hsdc..but im gona try 8gb soon...third party is allowed too...but mostly games and java games...i installed the touch piano and guitar..drums..a lot more and they work perfectly fine..but there is one bit of problem, about the camera...i am not sure what it causes it but..after taking a lot of pictures...the phone freezes =(the phone is awsome im rating it 4 out of 5 for the cam because of the part that it hangs....but it does not really matter to me coz the phone rocks ^_^ but for the phone itself, im rating it 5 out of 5 ^_^i recommend this phone...now i don't have to bring a camera with me anymore..i just pull out my phone and take pictures anytime anywhere ^_^", "Date": "March 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "A good dumb phone with a great camera. NOT FOR USE WITH ATT", "Author": "S. Morris", "ReviewID": "R3FZFSWEGOR7S1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I ordered this phone back in march, it was listed as a quad band phone, as in, it would work well with ATT. That was a complete lie and I'm glad to see they've changed it. So if you live Europe or are on T mobile(I can't attest to how well it works with T mobile), this is a good phone.Media / Features-.jar games run very well, smooth with little lag-the interface is good, not great, but that's to be expected from a non smartphone. Widgets are nice and add some flair to the menu, widgets are handled on the Renoir much better than on samsung touch whiz phones.-Web browsing is good for a non smartphone, probably the best I've used. also Wifi is a great addition.-I never used the music or video playback, but divx support is a hugge plus, the radio was clear and functional.Hardware-the phones looks much better in person, the three buttons on the buttons look tacky in pictures but are very nice in person, it's no iphone, but it is a good looking phone. The back is very nice and it feels sturdy, but still plastic-The touch screen is resistive, which is a bad thing. Texting with the full soft qwerty took some getting used it and is leagues behind the iphone. Drawing using the picture editor was a nightmare, even with a stylus. Tapping numbers was good enough, as was basic menu navigation.CameraArguably the main feature of the Renoir is the 8 megapixel camera. It is an excellent camera...for a phone. Taking excellently colored shots with a good XENON(!!) flash, and plenty of in phone editing options, like filters. It is much better than the LG viewty and the Samsung ultra touch camera and comparable to the cheapest point and shoots. That said compared with a  ~$200 canon point and shoot, the Renoir gets blown out of the water. But if all you use your camera for are posed shots in outdoor lighting, this could be an acceptable replacement for a point and shoot. This is probably the best camera availabe in any phone, at least in the top 3.Go to flickr, search LG Renoir for some good sample shots.It also takes decent video, I didn't use it often though.In conclusion, I do recommend this phone for anyone looking a fun, good looking, touch screen feature phone with a great camera. I think the black version is better looking, so I would get that.", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "LG Renoir", "Author": "Kebbe", "ReviewID": "R2EZV017QTBCVD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The LG Renoir freezes a lot which makes it frustrating to use.  It also turns off when it feels like it.A user cannot make or receive calls by pressing the appropriate button on a paired and connected bluetooth headset.  To make or receive calls you will have to use the buttons on the LG Renoir thus negating the purpose of having a bluetooth headset.The battery life is very poor.The reception is not very good.  I also own an LG cookie and I've notice that I can make and receive calls using the LG Cookie in a lot of areas with no problems. It is impossible to do the same in most of these areas with the LG Renoir even though I use the same sim card in both instances and the LG Renoir is a lot more costly than the LG Cookie.The camera on the LG Renoir is excellent.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Yes, the LG KC910 will work with AT&T;", "Author": "Pat72", "ReviewID": "RX0MVBZISTYJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Took me a whole lotta time to get it to work but, follow these instructions and you'll be on your way.It appears that a lot of people can't get their LG KC910 phones to work with AT&T.;Not to fret, I've solved the problem.Bring up the phone onto the screen.Enter:  3845#*910#(You may have to do this a few times because sometimes it will actually try to dial the number.This puts you in test mode.Scroll down and select:  Network modeScroll down and select:  GSM 850That's it!Enjoy this great phone and remember:  You didn't put one cent into Bill Gates or Steve Jobs pocket.Pat", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG KC910 So Disappointing", "Author": "Funky Chic", "ReviewID": "R57IBHKLOSZBM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received my LG KC910 3 weeks ago and over this period of time it has worked for about 4 days.  The phone freezes and shuts itself off.  Latterly it would look like it was on but nothing would appear on the screen other than a very faint background light then it would fade out.  The battery is fully charged and I haven't had it on or used it enough to use up any of the handset memory.  I am very disappointed in the company I bought it from as they are ignoring my messages that I have issues.  They did not take so long to take the money from my account.  Shame really as sound quality, picture clarity and ease of use was great..if only it would work.
