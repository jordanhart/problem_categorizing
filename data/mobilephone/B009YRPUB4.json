After a lot of searching online there seems to be a lot of misinformation from all of the cell phone review sites and blogs that say this phone is T-mobile 3G compatible. Huawei's website, which I should have checked before ordering, does not list T-mobile's 3G frequency (1700MHz) for this phone.We are able to get data on 2G EDGE through T-mobile and the phone itself is very nice for the price, especially since I upgraded it to Android ICS 4.03 very easily via Huawei's website. Just don't expect anything more than 2G speeds on T-mobile's network.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009YRPUB4"}}
