{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone but I prefer the flexibility of Virgin Mobile.", "Author": "S. Power", "ReviewID": "RJTMDELQBGZTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone, the Samsung Galaxy S2 4G is obviously not the newest version of this phone available.  If you want the very newest and best (The Samsung Galaxy S3), you won't get that on any other budget priced contract free carrier.  This phone is, however, very adequate, and by far the best phone ever offered for this low of a total cost of ownership.  I highly recommend that you consider this phone, but also look at the Virgin Mobile version of it, because their service is similar but their pricing is more flexible.I have had six different Android phones on pre-paid carriers, including the HTC EVO 4G, Motorola Triumph, Optimus, etcetera.  I bought this phone in November 2012 at Radio Shack, the day that it became available.  I still have an HTC Evo 4G in our family, but personally have been using this phone for over a month now, quite heavily.This Samsung Galaxy S2 4G runs Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), which is currently (at the time of this review) one version behind the newest versions of Android (Jelly Bean 4.1 & 4.2).  It has a fast dual core processor, good 8MP camera, is 4G capable, has great battery life, and has overall great performance. Although it has been out for over a year on Sprint, it is not nearly as far behind the mainstream as previous non-contract/prepaid offerings have been.Size. This phone is more similar in size to the Motorola Triumph than it is to the bulkier HTC EVO V 4G.  With a 4.52\" AMOLED touch screen and a thin body, it is the most compact phone for the screen size that non-contract/prepaid have ever had available.  I really like the form factor.  After using it for about a week without a case, I put an Otterbox Defender on it.  That case bulks the phone up quite a bit, but it is still comfortable.  I like it with or without the case, but got the case because of my clumsiness and lifestyle.Cases. Since this phone is identical to the one that has been on Sprint for over a year, there are plenty of great cases available for it, including ones from top of the line companies like Otter Box. There are many times more accessories available for it than for previous non-contract/prepaid, except for the HTC Evo V 4G which also had a lot of cases to choose from.Screen. I love the 4.52\" screen size, and this one is even sharper and more vivid than the one on the HTC Evo 4G, which was better than the Motorola Triumph.  It is great.Touch Screen. The touch screen is very responsive, accurate, and precise. By far the best touch screen I've ever used. Even better (or equal to) the one on the Apple Ipod Touch. I use that comparison because I've always felt that the Touch was better than the Android phones I'd had in the past.  The HTC Evo V 4G is the same in this regard.  Both phones have excellent touch screens.Keyboard. The touch screen keyboard on this phone is awesome.  The touchscreen keyboard on the HTC EVO V 4G was far better than any of the previous non-contract/prepaid offerings, and this one on the Samsung Galaxy S2 is even better.Battery. The battery life on this phone is incredible because of its increased size and better power management and network management. It lasts 3 times longer than the battery on the Motorola Triumph, and about twice as long as the one on the HTC EVO V 4G.  I like that this phone gives you an actual percentage reading for the battery instead of just the imprecise icon.Network management.  This phone is great at making seamless transitions between 3G, 4G, and Wifi, always switching to the best available choice.  The HTC Evo V 4G used to give me some problems in this area.  The S2 is flawless at this.Camera. The 8MP camera on this phone is far better than any cell phone I've ever had.  I think that it rivals the iPhone and in most conditions can fully replace your compact point and shoot camera.  The video camera shoots 1080p video and is also very good.4G.  Having 4G is great, especially since the Sprint 3G network is a little slow sometimes.Internet Sharing. The ability to share this phone's internet connection is awesome and works really well. It works great on both 3G and especially 4G. It is simple to use, and at $15 a month is a much better value than a Mifi card.Call Quality. The call quality is great on this phone, and is much better than the Motorola Triumph which sometimes sounded muffled, and slightly better than the HTC EVO V 4G which wasn't bad.  It is clear for both you and the person you are talking to.Bluetooth. The Bluetooth on this phone works great both with a headset and with my car. I love how it seamlessly transitions from my Podcast Application (Doggcatcher), Navigation, and phone calls.Processor. This phone is snappy and doesn't seem to have any processor induced lag at all. No matter what I run or play, it works the way it is supposed to, even when I'm multi-tasking. The processor seems to be more than adequate.Durability.  This phone is no more or less durable than any of the other plastic smart phones out there.  I personally wish that more phones were available with unibody metal housings.  I used to wish the same things about laptops and they are finally moving that way.  Hopefully more phones will be more durable in the future.  Anyway, this phone is adequate in this area.Reliability. So far, I have had no issues with applications or functions crashing on this phone. It works consistently and flawlessly. I will update this review if I find anything getting hung-up or crashing. I have had the phone since they first released it, and still haven't had any problems.  My experience in this area was the same on the HTC EVO V 4G.If there are any topics that you wanted me to address that I failed to, please let me know in the comments and I will update this review for you.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Prepaid Samsung Galaxy SII (Boost mobile)", "Author": "Amybeth", "ReviewID": "RC6RENXGWL4I5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a cell phone fanatic.  Since January of 2012, the Galaxy SII is my 4th phone. This one, though, I plan to keep a while.As for looks, if a phone can be sexy, this one is. It is beautifully designed with a slim profile.  While it boasts a 4.52 inch amoled display screen, the space is used wisely, and the phone isn't much wider.  The size is perfect, not too large, and easy to hold even for a smaller female with average sized hands. The charging port is on the bottom of the phone, completely unobtrusive and out of the way.  The volume rocker is easily accessed on the left side of the phone, and the power button is on the right side.  Ideally, that would be my only change, and while a lot of people have complimented the placement of the power button, I would rather have it on top, because I find when I hit the power button, I often end up squeezing the phone on both sides, consequently also adjusting the volume.  Still, that is a minor issue at best.  The camera is located in the middle of the phone, which is excellent.  When taking picutres quickly, it is easy to keep my hands/fingers out of the viewfinder with the phone located in the middle.Speaking of pictures, this 8mp camera takes excellent photos.  I have gotten many compliments on the quality of the pics from this phone, so much so, that I now leave my point and shoot at home.  The front facing camera, while on the D710 model I have is 2MP, it still isn't wonderful, however for Skype calls and the like, it is a wonderful feature. But quality wise, you won't be setting the world on fire.In terms of the sound quality for calls, etc, this phone is excellent. Volume for music/movies, etc is very good.  Tones for alarms and alerts are loud enough as well.  The volume and clarity during calls is also excellent. Voices sound crisp, without distortion or the skips and jumps and small oddities you get with voice calls on cell phones. I understand that for this phone, Samsung abandoned previously used Wolfson chip, which has led a few people to comment on a missed opportunity to improve music sound/depth.  However, I am not at all unhappy with how music or movies sound on this phone.  I think there is a definite improvement over my previous phones, and music sounds as good as if I was using my ipod.As far as battery life goes, Smartphones in general suck, but I find that the SGII is better than some others.  I am on my phone constantly, and while at home and in the car, it is always plugged in, I don't have many issues with battery drain if I am out and about all day.  I have purchased an extended battery for the phone but have not used it yet.I feel like I am forgetting some key points, but all in all I have to say this is an excellent phone, and the service through Boost Mobile can't be beat.  In addition to their call centers, brick and mortar stores are available if you have service issues.  The shrinkage program is wonderful and allows me to save money but still have unlimited everything.  Boost utilizes Sprint's 4g/3g network, so make sure you have coverage with Sprint prior to purchase.  Sprint has improved dramatically over the past decade, and their coverage is actually very good. I haven't experienced any dropped or lost calls..  Not sure if that speaks for the quality of the phone itself, or the service, perhaps both.  Either way, I am more than satisfied with the service and the Galaxy SII.

Because the Wi-Max network is shutting down, Boost customers should be looking only at 4G LTE phones, including the LG F7 and HTC SV.The Samsung Galaxy S II is a great phone. If rated by the quality of its large screen, quality of phone calls, its superior ability to handle basic functions such as texting, email, photos, videos, and music, the S2 is equal or superior to the Apple Iphone 5 and most other premium quality phones. For details on why the S2 is such a great phone, read some of the many \"Five Star\" Reviews.Battery life? Many of the \"Five Star\" and \"Four Star\" reviews mention poor battery life. That is a direct result of the low quality Wi-Max network. If a phone is getting a strong signal and can download data rapidly, there is a light load on the battery. If a phone is constantly searching for a usable signal and struggles to slowly download data, the load on the battery doubles or triples. A phone that gets eight hours per charge on a weak network would get up to 16 hours or 24 hours per charge on a strong network.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth every penny", "Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "RS1B5QOL3V36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing and it performs flawlessly, it has all the bell & whistles that I like without the torture of a contract, it's probably not the very latest model, but its close to the latest technology. Also Boost Mobile is one of the easiest activation process that I ever experienced, just follow the instructions provided and viola in less that 5 min you're ready to go. I personally suggest the 5$ insurance, it will save you lots of headache. The phone is 4.6 ounces lightweight (compare to HTC EVO) big screen 4.5in Super AMOLED, 1.2 GHz dual core processor, 1GB of RAM, 8 mp cam with flash, 1080p HD video recording, really!! Wow!, 2 mp front cam, 1800 mah battery, 16GB internal storage, removable storage up to 32GB, gorgeous white color.

The Galaxy Note 2 has an inch larger screen, faster processor, a pen and about $300 more unlocked. In reality, they are both basically the same phone as this. Samsung has had a year to iron the bugs out on this model and it shows. This phone is SMOOTH AS SILK.  And unlike HTC, Samsung doesn't load the phone to the gills with unremovable crapware. Samsung and Boost still put some crapware of their own, but it is not as overwheming or as numerous as what was on my HTC Design 4G. Another tempting unlocked phone is the Nexus 4, which is sexy as hell, and only $300 and a 2 month wait today. But consider this. Reality check - \"no removable battery\" is a death wish for an android phone (it will eventually freeze and you will be up the creek.) Add to that a fragile breakable glass back and no SD card slot = buy the expandable Samsung in my book. Take my word for it - this is the phone you want today and will still be happy with a year from now. Fast. Beautiful BIG screen. Made the HTC Design screen look tiny by comparison. Clear talk at both ends. It works GREAT as a phone - many of these smartphones are great at web and other stuff but SUCK as phones. Incredibly excellent camera with phenominally useful software for taking photos. And it focuses and takes shots very quickly, so you will actually use it. The only cameras I have seen better than this is the camera in the iPhone 4S and 5. They are a tiny bit better. XLNT Hotspot function. Yes, like all smartphones today, it is fragile but that is easy to fix. Want it bulletproof? Order an Otterbox Defender case (I do) and you can throw your phone across the room without hurting it. Been wth Boost 4 years now - the customer service is no better or worse than the expensive guys, but Sprint (which is Boost) has great coverage here around Eugene OR and most of the Western states where I live and travel.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love my phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R10BJ2F2WBKTCF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love my S11.

I got tried of paying AT&T; so much money every month.  As a former Iphone user I think this is comparable or even better than the Iphone 4.  Its very fast and where I live the boost coverage has been pretty good.  I think the best feature of this phone is the screen it beautiful.  I also like the ability to add a 32GB Micro SD card.  You can put movies and music right on the card and the phone will play them.  I hated I Tunes it was just a pain to use.  I would have given this phone a 5 stars, but the only down fall is the battery life is horrible.  I know most smart phone are horrible but this is way worse than my iphone was as far as battery life.  I'm looking into purchasing options for another battery.  If I can figure out a way to increase the battery life....this would be a 5 star phone.  Overall boost mobile is saving me about 40 dollars a month right now... but after the 18 months i will be saving $55 dollars a month.

No...it isn't the absolute best and most powerful phone on the market. But it's close enough for the deal you get with Boost.  This IS a top tier phone.  And yes, it has unlimited everything.  With Boost's $55/mo. plan that you can shrink to $40/mo....you can't go wrong. (I am grandfathered into the $35/mo.) Where else can you get a high-end, current smartphone with sooooo many bells on 4g with unlimited everything for soo little with no contract? The answer....no-where.  People need to quit whining that this phone is better or that phone is better.  I've had Boost for a long time and their call quality and reliability is better than some of the major carriers.  I have dreamed of being able to get a phone like this native on a Boost account, but figured it would never happen for what I pay monthly.  Well, they did it. I love it. It's awesome...plain and simple.*edit*Since Boosts decision to put a data cap on their \"Unlimited\" data, I have since jumped ship and changed carriers.

The camera on this phone is okay...I've had better. The battery life is not very impressive either...I have to recharge at the end of every day.

Inside buildings I rarely have more than 1 or 2 bars, and even in the heart of town I have an average of only 3 bars where my previous Boost phone (LG Marquee) would have 5 or more. I have a hard time getting emails because of constant \"network unavailable\" messages, again I never had these problems with my Marquee or my Samsung Prevail.Pretty lousy battery life. It's very rare that I make it through an entire day without recharging and yes, I'm using Juice Defender Pro and all the other power-saving settings and I'm hardly a heavy talker/browser/streamer3G coverage constantly turns itself off (I have to go into settings to switch it back on) which means no push notifications for emails, texts, etc. VERY ANNOYING!I'm on Boost (which is great BTW!) and just upgraded from the LG Marquee. While I love all the features of ICS, and I love the look and feel of the Galaxy2, its cell and wi-fi reception is pretty darned bad! I'm using the exact same towers as I was on the Marquee, and the difference in reception is huge. While I did have problems with the Marquee freezing while using navigation, the S2 has not frozen on me yet, but, it does reboot several times per day and that's not a good sign.After much consideration, I'm returning the S2 and picking up an HTC Evo 4G LTE instead. If the S2 functioned anywhere close to how it was supposed to it would be a great phone, but as it is it's not going to cut it for my purposes. NOTE: While it is possible that I have a defective phone, if you google \"S2 reception problems\" you'll see many other who have had the same issues as I have.

Everything seems to work fine, but the professional reviews exaggerate several of its features. For example, reviews pretty unanimously rave about the camera. Yes, it is good for a phone, but it is only equal to a $50 stand-alone digital camera. The wifi radio is weak, since my routers produce very strong signals that everything with wifi rate as 5 bars consistently. This phone rates it as one bar, and occasionally two. The phone radio is weak, as is the data radio for 3G and 4G. My 7 year old nokia has a much stronger phone radio. The screen is nice and everything works quite quickly, but then again, we are talking about a half a second or so faster than a much cheaper phone. For the no contract price for boostmobile, I was expecting the phone to be cased in gold!... not really, but you get the point. Setup on boostmobile was effortless on line, which is the way I like to do everything and not have to talk with a person in India. Boostmobile everything plan is great, so far, but this phone is just OK for the price.UPDATE 08/13Wifi has improved with the updates, so wifi, as well as 3G and 4G are stronger now.

My complaint has to do with the phone and the hardware.  When I first purchased the phone last November, which was almost a year ago, I got the replacement plan, and replaced my phone after 6 months because it stopped charging.  It would get overheated.  So I replaced it and paid over $100 to replace it.  That's right, because when you replace the phone, you have to purchase a new replacement plan.  Now....5 months in on the 2nd phone and I'm starting to have the same problems that I had with the first phone. The battery sucks.  I purchased the extended battery thinking it would help...and it's not much better than the original battery.  If I could just keep this thing charged, I would be very happy with the phone.  But, it's taking forever to charge this phone.  Something is not right! Even after I replaced all the chargers (car, house, office) for the first phone, it still didn't make a difference, and so I don't want to go out and invest all that $$ again to replace my chargers when that's not the real problem.  Know what I mean??  And, if I give it a full charge, within hours of no use and no apps running, I quickly loose 25% to 50% of the charge...when I'm not even using it. ??  I'm just about to give up.  I would not sell this phone to my worst enemy.  The reason I came on here and decided to write this review is because I'm hunting for a new phone and reading reviews and thinking....why do all these other reviewers think that the samsung galaxy is such a great phone.Oh...and a few more things.  While I'm ranting about the hardware.  The service does not work in East TN.  I could not use this phone at all when I was in Gatlinburg on a family vacation.  I also have trouble with it in southern virginia...anywhere in mountain areas.  I can use it fine in central virgia and northern virginia.  That may be why they pulled Boost out of my area...because of coverage issues in the southern part of Virginia??Also, some mechanical issues....there is no button to push for the camera.  The camera is touch screen only.  Super annoying.  Also..this could just be a user problem on my part, but I have yet to be able to merge calls...and sometimes when I'm on a call, I'm unable to turn on the speaker.  It's like a glitch or something strange happens.  Sometimes, I can't disconnect a call. I have to take the battery out and put it back in.  Haaahaa!

I've had both Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile since kicking the postpaid plans to the curb.  Both providers use the Sprint network and both offer satisfactory service.  The only drawback with prepaid is that there is no roaming available at all.  Ever.  (Unless you use MetroPCS, but they charge a lot for it.)  So, if you live in the sticks or spend a lot of time away from the metropolitan areas with abundant towers, don't bother with prepaid.  I live in NJ and only had a problem getting a signal after Superstorm Sandy came and wiped out a bunch of towers.  My service is back to normal now.About the phone:  Easy to use, lots of apps available, clear screen, and great sound quality.  The navigation feature works better than my temperamental Garmin GPS. This device has everything I need and want in a phone and I don't have to pay out of my rear end for it every month.  With Boost, it's $55/month, unlimited data, texting, and domestic calling.  And for every 6 months you pay on time, they knock $5 off your payment.  I'll be down to $45/month in two months.  Also, unlike the prepaid 3G i-phone that is now being offered by Boost and Virgin, the Galaxy S II runs on a 4G network.  Pages actually load faster on my phone than on my crappy laptop.  I'm happy with my purchase and take pride in the fact that I have not yet become an i-sheep.  If you want to save money every month and don't care about having the very latest phone, get yourself a Galaxy S II with Boost or Virgin.

The price I got this phone for which is 199.99 seemed like a pretty good bargain, and a step up from my HTC Evo Design 4G from Boost.It has a fast processor, lots of internal memory, and an 8 MP camera. All great things.These things however REALLY annoy me. First the phone honestly feels really cheap. It doesn't feel good in my hands at all. the back cover feels like just a piece of plastic. The texting on this phone is really a pain. I don't know about anyone else, but I keep always hitting the wrong keys over and over. This is the only phone I've had an ongoing problem like this with. This phone takes so long to charge. I'm talkin about it you leave your phone charging for about an hour, don't be suprised if it only charges about 5% in that time. Freezes a lot.And second this is not so much with the phone but more of Boost Mobile/Sprint. This phone is advertised as being a 4G phone. Unfortunately that's pretty much a lie, because the only 4G service it can pick up is from Sprint's WiMax network and that is pretty much non-existing since Sprint has decided to go 4G LTE, and even then, the service around here is still pretty bad in comparison to most other carriers, despite being in a huge metropolitan area. So in order to experience 4G service from Boost Mobile (Sprint) you'd have to actually pick up a phone that was 4G LTE capable, such as the more recent Galaxy S III with a hefty price tag.

I had an LG Marquee before this phone and what an upgrade it has been. No lags or jitters at all. Battery life could be better, but I get a full 12 hours of moderate use out of it including some youtube videos over wifi and few hours on reddit. Sprint does not have WiMax where I live so I keep 4g off all the time, I am sure your battery life will be a little worse when on 4g but I cannot comment on that. The screen is gorgeous even compared to the bright screen on LG Marquee. When I switched the phone over, Boost reset my account back to $55 a month and I had to call them again to fix it and add my shrinkage status back on. I recommend calling them to activate this phone rather that doing it online.The main reason I bought this phone is the camera and I have definitely not been disappointed. It can definitely replace a point and shoot in daylight settings. Night shots are very grainy just like any point and shoot and even the bright LED can only do so much. It will definitely not replace my DSLR for night shots. I shoot video on 720p only and have noticed it is a quite smoother compared to 1080p recording. The auto focus hunts a lot during video and can lead to quite a few seconds of blurry footage when moving the phone around. Call quality coming from the LG Marquee has been a night and day difference. Calls sound much clearer on the earpiece speaker and the speakerphone and the callers can hear me perfect. One big upgrade has been the signal strength of this phone. My LG Marquee had anywhere between 30% and 50% time without signal under the battery usage option in settings. On this phone it has been consistently under 1% and mostly it is at 0%.The phone is very slim and light considering its size. Comfortable to hold but I do have big hands. This phone shipped with ICS stock and going by the prior record at Boost, I doubt we will ever see JB upgrade.Now the cons:This phone has a serious wifi bug or maybe I have a hardware problem in my phone. Around 50% of the time it will not connect to wifi unless I turn the wifi on and off again.The phone randomly shuts off a few times a week. I take it out of my pocket and realise it has been off. I have not been able to exactly pin point any reason why it has been doing that. It could be a battery issue or some app not playing nice. One thing I have noticed is that the battery takes a huge hit every time it happens. For example, my battery would be at 50%. I check it after about half an hour and the phone is off, the battery was at around 15%. From what I have gathered reading online, battery is the most likely culprit. I just ordered an extended battery from Amazon today and will update this review after using the new battery for a few days. I did call Boost mobile about this but it has been more than a month since I bought this phone and they referred me to Samsung. I was told by Samsung to send the phone in for a \"checkup\" which would take about ten days. I would rather live with the problem than to go back to the Marquee for even one day. If it does reboots even with the new battery I will just switch to some custom ROM even though I stopped doing that after destroying quite a few phones.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone", "Author": "Jamie Fisher", "ReviewID": "RW6P4RW8H1SZZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this phone as a late Xmas gift for my fianc\u00e9 and he hasn't gotten off of it yet.

Industry reporting indicates 44 percent of Android users are still using versions 2.3.3 through 2.3.7 - known as Gingerbread - which were released in 2011 and have a number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions. The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date.\"The bulletin proceeded to identify SMS Trojans, rootkits and fake Google Play domains as security threats and offered various mitigation strategies.For example, to fight against SMS Trojans it advised, \"Install an Android security suite designed to combat these threats. These security suites can be purchased or downloaded free from the Internet.\"To protect against fake domains, \"Install only approved applications and follow IT department procedures to update devices' OS. Users should install and regularly update antivirus software for Android devices to detect and remove any malicious applications.\"The IT industry and tech-savvy users have known about these types of security concerns - stemming from Android fragmentation, most mobile phone manufacturers' sloth and indifference, and user inertia and ignorance - for a while now.

Great display, great feature set and pretty sturdy as well. Boost mobile is cheap and the cell service was good.  But that was during the first 2 months of ownership...And all has not been without issues...I have had the phone for 2 months now with no problems at all.  None.  Long enough to become dependant on its great looks, perfect size, excellent feature set and pc-like capabilities along with messaging, email & voice of course. This week, 2 out of 4 days it was dead - completely out of commission.  First time because, although I thought I had signed up for auto-pay via online account it did not go through for some glitchy reason.  And without warning my service was suspended at the end of the due day so the next day I had no service.  Called Boost that evening when I got home from work and they enabled the autopay. Then, 2 days later, I go to charge my phone and it won't charge.  Just a blinking \"blue light of death\" all day.  It turns out the battery had such a low charge that the std. charger would not bring it back.  I tried a car quick charger - just by sheer chance - and it got the solid red \"charging\" light back and after an hour or so it came back to life enough to turn it back on again (and continue charging up to full capacity).I really don't like Boost Mobile's payment methodology at all - they use a \"wallet\" system.  You have to add money to the wallet and then they draw upon it to pay your bill. So when I called support to find out why my service was off and they said because my payment was not received the person kept saying how much do you want to add to your \"wallet\" and I said I just want to pay what I owe - nothing more and nothing less. No meeting of the minds there.  So he says $55 for the month, do I want to go ahead and add that?  I say \"with tax its $59 something so should'nt it be that?  Then he's like \"ok we have added the 59 something, enabled autopay and you're all set. Ok that's good.  Another thing I don't like about boost is that I get a late payment email notice every month so far - it arrives after my ontime payment was made.  Then its followed by another email thanking me for my ontime payment.  ?????? (update: this practice seems to have stopped now)To add to this review - now this week I have had no service at all when I am at work.  For 3 days now.  That is absolutely unacceptable since that is the primary reason I have a cell phone. The support in India said I have \"best service\" at my work location.  So I called them from my work phone - they asked if I was on a diff phone for the call and I said yes because I had no service.  Well they tried having me do an update and reset and all that stuff which it obviously could not since it had no service to download anything - duh!!When I left work and got within range of another tower the phone started doing updates, etc. automatically because of the previous attempts with tech support when there was no service.  Did not fix the problem - my phone works everywhere except at my work (inside or out) still.  I think the sprint cell tower there is out of commission but they do not care to investigate that aspect.I am tired of this crap - never experienced anything like this in over 10 years of verizon service - guess that's what the additional cost buys you - a cell phone and network that work when and where you need it.  I hate verizon but it seems if I want a working cell phone then I have to go back to them.  Sprint network is horrible, boost support is horrible, and now I have sprint to hate even more than verizon.  Go figure.Will give sprint the rest of this week to get the tower where I work online again and if I still can't make calls from work then I will cancel my service and unload this phone for whatever I can get.  I will not deal with any carrier that uses sprint network ever again either.  I guess this network is for kids just looking for a cool, wifi device to show off to their freinds - its not for adults or those who seriously need a phone to make calls with.  Oh yes, and I never received 4G at any time during the last 3 months and I live on the I-95 corridor which is full of towers, and, as the support person said, where I am I have \"best service\".  So much for Sprint's best - no service at all.  My only installed apps were netflix, firefox and youtube.  Nothing else.Added a few weeks later...So Boost Support has called me multiple times since above review was posted  Of course it was always while I was driving or otherwise busy and not able to mess around with the phone at the time.  They wanted to do a factory reset as a last measure and if that didn't work the next step was to send the phone back to Samsung.  Both pointless IMO based on the symptoms.But I did the reset - mp3s and pics stayed on card.  Contacts were on gmail.  Now back to factory fresh phone.  Got my music but no longer are the ringtones set to contacts.  Had to re-enter all my wpa2 keys again.  Had to reenter all my passwords for everything.  Reinstall the few apps I had.  To be expected for sure in case you were to get rid of your phone I guess but a bit of a hassle in this case.Still no signal within a couple of miles of my work.  Gave up having a phone at work for a week or so even though I carried it with me still because I have service everywhere else.  Then, a week later I start getting calls at work again.  So what changed?  My guess is enough people complained to Sprint/Boost/Virgin in that area and they finally fixed the cell tower.  Nice. (sarcasm and relief)  I did find something else out too.  If we get a good snow storm the snow on the roof of the building blocks the signal, but only when inside the building and all I have to do is step outside the door to get reception.So I am not through with Boost because I am not ready to crawl back to Verizon and pay $100 plus tax each month for less data and limited minutes of talk and phones that have had features removed so they can make you buy what is free with everyone else.  The tradeoff with a carrier like boost is spottier service and almost never do I get 4G even in what is supposed to be a 4G best reception area. In fact, I don't know that I have ever gotten 4G reception at all.  For me 3G and wifi is fine as long as it is working when I want to make a call.I do love this Samsung Galaxy S2 though - it is, without a doubt, the best electronic device I have ever owned and so far I have not desired a feature or function that it doesn't have.Another update:I have had the phone for 7 months now. Due to payment issues I have had only 5 on time payments so I have yet to get my rate reduced by $5 yet.  Should happen next month.The tech support, being in India, is not any worse than if they were in the next state IMO since the same problem solving script would be used regardless and I wouldn't be able to drive down there and yell at someone in person anymore than fly to India, LOL.  The techs have always been very friendly even if they had to follow a preset script for problem resolution so I do not have any animosity toward.  I have also become more accustomed to the wallet system.The 4G does work in most areas and worked everywhere while I was on vaca in FL from West Palm to Ocala with one exception.  At Disney World it did not work well at all in the park but then neither did the Verizon or AT&T; phones of others either.  I have to manually turn off Wi-Fi and turn on 4G - and that is why I was not getting it before. Coverage here in CT is very spotty in some areas but the spots with no coverage for the most part are very small - no reception for literally a few hundred yards while driving.Based on my current satisfaction with Boost, I would up my stars to 4 now but I am not going to change it at this point because the 3 stars shows my aggravation over the issues I have had.  I guess the proper rating would be 4.5 stars for the S3 (always room for improvement) and 4 stars for Boost.  I have gotten over the bumps and I am pretty certain I will never go back to a contract again. (ok, I did up the stars from 3 to 4 with this update)Yeah, I know, its a book at this point but I figured I'd relate my total experience for those others who are new to smart phones still and/or want to go with a month to month payment methodology rather than a contract in addition to wondering if a Galaxy would be a great phone.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "Steven Moll", "ReviewID": "R1OEI4O5RYHVU8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Switching from AT&T; to Boost Mobile was one of the best decisions I've ever made.But, with switching, I would not be able to continue to use my iPhone.This phone beats the iPhone 4 ten-fold.My ONLY issue with this phone is the battery life.It will last 1 day with not much use, or 6-7 hours with heavy use (Games, music, wifi, 4g, etc).But, there happens to be an amazing battery/backing for sale on amazon.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006SK5HHW/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01With this new battery, my phone lasts up to 5 days with heavy usage!If you get the phone and a larger battery (Not necessarily the one I linked), you will be a very happy S2 owner.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "good but...", "Author": "nicole", "ReviewID": "RX59JLFGZ0HMC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "way better than the zte warp.. fast love the phone but every once in awhile it doesnt ring and sometimes it has shut itself off and i need to take the battery in and out to be able to get it back on.. i understand its boost mobile not verizon and technology isnt perfect but still.. its a pain in the @$$", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice phone", "Author": "gringolin", "ReviewID": "RS7DC6K6TO9RY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "finally boost has a phone worth owning.thank god amazon sells boost, because boost has HORRIBLE customer service.i have only had 1 day, but so far, it takes awesome picturs, and skype works nicely", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Good Phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1C48F5LFLHRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm pretty happy with this phone.

It is fun, powerful, runs all but the very latest games (Need For Speed Most Wanted plays like a dream), and has expandable memory.The network speeds are usually on the low end and Boost Mobile has a deceptive payment system, where they charge an additional $5.40 on top of whatever they say your monthly fees will be. It is also unclear from their website if you can set autopay and the shrinkage plan at the same time. When I signed up for service, I hit auto pay and thought that I was covered. When I checked my account, it only says that I need to make another payment soon. If I try to edit plans to turn on autopay and shrinkage, it says they're both on, then when I reload my plan it says I'm still on manual payments.This confusion and what looks like an intentional system set up to make people mess up their shrinkage-required on-time payments is unacceptable and I will NEVER make the mistake of buying a phone through Boost Mobile again. I plan on keeping this for no more than a year, and dumping it for a different carrier as soon as possible.Back to the phone: In the month that I've owned it, the only problem I've had was from an application crashing, but that was easily solved by Googling the name of the error and simply pressing a few buttons to clear a cache. Since then it's been running without a problem.The Google app store has lots of amazing apps, you can turn your phone into a musical instrument, a scientific calculator, and a ton of other things. The best apps tend to cost a buck or five, but if you can afford this phone you should be able to afford that easily. If you can't, there are a ton of ad-supported free apps that will get you by.The phone itself gets 5 stars, but since it's tied to Boost, and I'm stuck with it for now, I'm giving this particular version of it only 2. Their entire payment model is based around \"in 16 months it'll be cheaper\", but it only took me one month of ambiguity for me to distrust Boost, and there's no way I'll be staying for 16 or more.I don't mind people voting that this comment was unhelpful, but would you mind leaving a comment to explain why as well so I can see why you think my lack of a recommendation is flawed.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Eric Clevinger", "ReviewID": "R34QNHCZ14CP4J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this as a gift for someone and they keep telling me how wonderful and easy to use.

Baker", "ReviewID": "RKD30N8J213LS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update #2:Shortly after my last update, Boost actually got everything working. So after several months of use, I've updated to 3 stars to reflect my current impression of the phone and service.  I'll leave my original review and update #1 below for new purchasers and context.  For this update I'll tackle the phone and service provider separately.First, let's take Boostmobile as a service provider:Startup - 0 Stars: As stated in my original review there were some huge startup issues for me, almost to the point of me switching carriers.  The difficulty in reaching a real live customer service tech is a sure sign that they don't want to deal with you.  After numerous hours on the phone, and after many call backs on my part, Boost eventually got everything working. As stated below, I do believe much of the issue was based on the fact that I was a Sprint user prior to transferring, so this may not be an issue for you.3G/4G/data service - 3 stars:  When in the city, the service works well as advertised.  Occassionally though when travelling or on the outskirts of a major city, I'm able to make calls, but the data service doesn't work, so no access to emails etc.  If the data connection is important to you and you travel, I'd go with one of the big 3 providers.  Also, the Wimax 4G is nice when the phone can find it, which isn't very often.Price - 5 stars: The long term cost saving are the reason we are on Boost in the first place.Second, my thoughts on the phone:4 stars - The phone is a 5 star phone (minus 1 star for the infrequent freeze up as stated below).  I really like the phone, it's got a great screen, Android runs smoothely on it, the battery life is good.  All in all, I can see myself keeping this phone for quite some time.  The only negative is the fact that about once a week, it'll just freeze up.  I'm hoping the latest update will address that issue, but it's too early to tell at this point.  I purchased the warranty, so I'll consider swapping it out for a new one if the update doesn't fix the freeze issue.Overall, I'd recommend the phone given some caveats based on my prior feedback.------1st, I've had the phone for about a week, and I've already had to pull the battery twice due to it freezing up for an extended period of time. I really like the phone (when it works) but something appears to be wrong with it.  I had the HTC Evo previously and don't recall having this issue.2nd, Boost has been unable to get the voicemail working at all when they transferred my number.  I've had to call numerouse times and log multiple tickets. Getting a phone transferred shouldn't be this big of a headache. They don't call or follow up at all, so you have to call every 2-3 days to get any forward action.I really want it to work out, but the phone is most likely going back and I'll be switching carriers.  I'll give it a few more days to see if the phone locks up again and to see if they are able to get my voicemail working.  I'll update again either way.Update: 2+ weeks and Boost has still not been able to get my voicemail working, plus it froze up again. The customer service is frustratingly funny, I have to laugh at it.  Anyway, I will be sending it back.  I may try the Samsung Galaxy 2 on StraightTalk because I really like the phone, and I'm hoping it doesn't have any freezing issues.Sprint users: If you transfer your number to Boost, you won't be able to transfer back to Sprint.  I had issues a couple of years ago related to a Boost-to-Sprint transfer, and actually had to do an interim switch to a 3rd carrier.  Anyway, this time around, I believe this may be part of the issue with my voicemail not working -  the fact that I was transferring my number from Sprint to Boost (same network, same company).

I had a Net10 LG Optimus for $45.00 per month but switched to Boost because of the better cell offerings.Complaints:No less than two representatives from Boost Mobile told before I bought the phone ($299.00) that there would no extra charges if I used Auto Reboost each month to pay for phone charges. This service debits your credit card each month. After I signed up for Auto Reboost with a representative, I got a letter in the mail stating that my monthly bill will be $59.24.Yes, they charge an extra $4.24 to use your credit card or bank.These representatives either LIED to me or were ignorant of what their company does.In big and bold all over their Website, they advertise only $55.00 per month. Net10 never charged any extra for automatic withdrawals from my credit card.Clearly, they want you to pay with Boost cards every month so that you may forget to pay on time and never experience their widely advertised shrinkage plan. If you have a mind of steel, then purchase the Boost cards every month from Walmart or Target and then go to the Boost Website and add the payment, or sign up for Auto Reboost and let then charge you the extra $50.00 per year($4.24 per month) to provide for their corporate and executive bonuses perhaps.Also good luck talking with a representative. You will have to first navigate the most convoluted phone tree known to man and waste 15 or more minutes of your life.I strongly urge you to look elsewhere for you cell phone services.I will now just drown myself in regret.....=========================================================================================================UPDATE: December 29th 2012- I went to a Best Buy store to buy a Reboost card for $55.00 and I literally laughed at the checkout as the total came to $59.24. It appears that Boost is unwilling to absorb taxes and charges like other companies.Based upon the comments from others who say that it is only $55.00 if you pay your fees at a Boost store, they don't want you to use a credit card as they would have to absorb a few dollars. Net10 and Tracphone cards are face value only, regardless of payment method. It is true though that if companies have box stores in you State, you must pay taxes. This may be the problem. Perhaps Boost should train their staff and be a bit more candid about what the customer will really be paying.In addition, I find their Website to be poorly constructed and primitive in design and function. Definitely a second class company.I suppose if you had time to waste, you could go to a Boost store and pay with cash or a check every month. If this isn't an inconvenience to you then all is grand!The primary problem is that Boost representatives have no idea that there are additional charges with Autoreboost using a credit card. (At least the four different people I had talked with).I don't believe that you can change companies and use the same phone as there isn't any SIM card. You are struck with what you have!I will concede to paying the additional $4.24 with Autoreboost since I don't have the time to run to a Boost store every month.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buy the phone was released as q Thinking GSM chips and sent me which was not", "Author": "alex", "ReviewID": "R2LM4QNR1P7U5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "By alex - See all my reviewsThis review is from: Samsung Galaxy S II 4G Prepaid Android Phone, White (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)Gentlemen, I ordered the characteristic of the cell was to be released and for GSM chip and there went q was released but I was not sent the I await your response as my pack is faulty and replace it with one that has GSM MODEL BUT SAME TEAM PLEASE How I can contact the store with you to buy the phone I want the qSamsung Galaxy S II 4G Prepaid Android Phone, GSM CHIP published RELEASED SOLO ESPERO SU RESPUESTA Y LE AGRADEZCO SU COLABORACION LO MAS PRONTO POSIBLE GRACIAS ESTARE PENDIENTE PARA ASI HACER LA DEVOLUCION DEL EQUIPO CON LAS CARACTERISTICA Q DESEO GRACIA ESTE ES MI CORREO alexcegarra576@gmail.com ya q hice la compra de ese equipo y deseo cambiarlo por que les digo gracias desde venezuela", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "sucks", "Author": "Crystal", "ReviewID": "RX5XWOPGYS16E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i recevied the phone and it has a  unch of numbers in it... i wouldnt give it no raitings but i had too.. but this is the worst order ever i mean omfg.... den i told cellardirect whats been going on with the phone dey couldnt say nun abut it... dey acted like it was almost new... lies lies lies never again i will buy a phone from here 20 thumbs down if i had those many thumbs", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mad", "Author": "Nancy F.
