Koretsky \"DIYer\"", "ReviewID": "R1YWKI8DWHK9SC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one of these at my local Fred Meyer, IWireless Sprint network?, and the first one didn't work, but I took it back and they gave me a new one no questions asked. I've had the second one for a year, and have had no problems with it. Reception is very good, battery lasts( I just replaced the original battery a couple of weeks ago), a well made cell phone. Slide out keyboard is awesome, I never texted before, now I'm a texting addict!The only shortcoming I've noticed is the exposed buttons on the main keypad get pressed when you keep it in your shirt pocket, or in a jacket pocket. But I haven't made very many unwanted calls in more than a year.I love it!", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Best Phone I've Ever Had.", "Author": "Pop77o7", "ReviewID": "RSCVCYQ2P4CAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this phone for a good while until the battery started to go bad in less than a year. I don't know why I didn't think of just ordering a new battery online (Duhhh)... I'm very hard on my phones. I broke my last one when I got so angry I smashed it! Miraculously it still functioned, though it made the battery life WORSE. Still, it's durable!I just ordered my 2nd one of these today, and I'm so excited!!! Texting on a PHYSICAL keyboard is so much easier and nearly autocorrect errorproof, and that's why I love going for this kind instead of a smartphone (happy with a simple iPod). I also really love the voicemail options where you can record something and use it as a ringtone.So:1. It gets what I want done.2. It has a physical keyboard3. Voice recordings can be made into ringtones.4. It's durable. I smashed it and it still worked. :-PSo excited for my next Rumor 2 (Not smashing it this time.)", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "cell phone", "Author": "bruno", "ReviewID": "R3AFLL9ML584BK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "what a great phone for the money. it works really well and I am able to text very easily.

But when I received it it would not hold a charge. If I answer this phone off the charger the phone dies within 20 seconds. Also the buttons double click themselves. If you are texting and hit the delete button sometimes it will delete your entire 2 page message! I cannot use the full keyboard because some of the buttons do not work, others double click themselves and some will turn the phone off! The phone was delivered with a letter that asked to please email them if there was any issue with the phone before leaving a bad review. I did send this email the day after I received the phone. I asked them to send me a new one. I told them if they sent a paid return shipping box with the new phone i would happily return the device i have. I have not even recieved an email back! this was almost a month ago. I have a 2 year old daughter and have to drive around at night with no phone because this one will not stay on!

Not the case with this phone. Also when the seller contacted me( I believe I was sent an email first) I expressed my concerns about the shipping time. I got it in a week. I was not satisfied with that, and I asked the seller to make up for it by refunding my shipping fee. I told him that the fact that it did not arrive in the time that it said it would was false advertising. Upon my request for a shipping refund, he accused me of trying to extort money from him. I told him that of course the fact that the product did not arrive when it said it would definitely would affect my review, and if he submitted me a refund for the shipping that would change my review, make it a little better, because I would have received some kind of compensation for my unexpected wait. He accused me of trying to take money out of his family's pocket, and said that extortion was not permitted by amazon, and that he would report me. I told him to go right ahead....I kept all his emails, and emails from other sellers that compensated me when something went wrong. The phone itself is a pretty color, but the screen is quite small and the letters and numbers are a bit hard to see. I was okay with that. If the seller did not have the type of attitude that he did I would have gave him a better rating. I don't feel I did anything wrong....as I said I have been compensated in the past for similar issues or over something else. I wasn't trying to extort money from him for a better review, I was simply stating that the phone did not arrive in the time that it said it would, and if he would refund my shipping fee than that may change my review of the product despite the time when it arrived. I thought that would be fair. I may in fact report him for slander or whatever, because what he said was completely unjustified. Not a good experience. When something says that it will be there in a certain amount of time than that's when it should be there. And if it is not then of course a consumer is going to be not happy with that and sellers have it within their power to make the customer happy. He did not do that, and insulted me on top of it. Beware who you deal with folks and what they say. Those ratings aren't there for nothing. This seller did not have a great rating to begin with, but it was based on six sales so I decided to give the seller a chance.

Not because of the phone but because the seller put it out there as slightly used, and it has so many issues it is not enough room to put it all. The biggest issue is the cost vs the worth. I paid 40$ for a SLIGHTLY used phone that barely works. The buttons stick, it shuts off constantly, and wont hold a chrge. So the battery is useless!

A reset of the phone did not allow thephone to be activated to the Sprint network and two different Sprint techs tried but could not find thephone in their phone database which of course also meant they couldnt activate the phone.  The phone itselfwas in great condition, also the delivery was fast.  Since the phone didnt activate I returned it to theAmazon vendor and there were no problems communicating the issue and returning the phone.

I assumed that when I ordered this used phone through Amazon, from OEM Battery Supply, I would get a charger and a battery and perhaps, a booklet or receipt which told me the serial number of the phone. I even paid extra to get the phone sooner but it took almost a week to get it. It seems solid and everything but unfortunately I cannot use it because the battery that the seller included DOES NOT FIT THE PHONE! And this is from a company which calls themselves a battery supply company (those two words (Battery Supply) are actually in their company name! I wrote them an email and included my work phone in hopes that they would call me and try to make it right. But so far, nothing.
