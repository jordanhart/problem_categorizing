I have been with straight talk for a while, and it seems for me to be the best prepaid phone Compared to others I have tried in the past.  I have to be patient with the customer service because even though its not the best. It is getting better. I get the best phone clarity, and hardly any dropped calls if any.  I just got the phone activated yesterday.  I had to wait for sim card. I am more than happy with the phone.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic phone, back for another one", "Author": "Betz \"betzzz\"", "ReviewID": "R3BJLBKOILW7H5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone. I purchased one about 2 1/2 years ago, refurbished, and have not had one bit of trouble with it.  Qwerty keyboard is fast, I never missed a call, never have I had trouble sending a call either.  I was able to get on the internet with no problems ever, and never, ever dropped a call. My son, and husband also own the t401g, and they are still going, and also have never had a problem with theirs, ( We all use Straight Talk Phone Service.)I am back to purchase another one, because I was on a boat, and ended up dropping it in the water...(long story.)  I would recommend this phone to anyone, and hopefully it will service you well, as it has for me.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "It was a good and tough phone", "Author": "jess \"BB\"", "ReviewID": "R2ROVJPZHW4RSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this phone for 14 months and Im the roughest with phones.

I have been getting calls from West Virginia on a semi-regularly basis since I got the phone !!over a year!! ago. The internet barely runs (not that I care about that, just letting everyone know) and I loose service EVERY TIME I talk on the phone. The camera is terrible, the voicemail sometimes doesn't work at all and the memory capacity isn't very good either. The only good thing I have to say about  this phone, is that It has pretty good battery life, and I drop it all the time usually on hard surfaces, and it still never fails.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased", "Author": "Callista", "ReviewID": "R3DI3AO67G5VM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is in very good shape!Like it was new.

I had a 451c n it picked up service everywhere. I thought I was upgrading an do like the extras on this phone but it really doesn't mean anything when you can't receive service to talk on it. What would normally be a 5 minute conversation quickly becomes 15 minute one because of dropped calls.
