A few quirks that I don't like.  The time format is 24-hour format (military time) with no way to change it.  The date format is DD-MM-YYYY, with no way to change it.  No speed dial option, which means anytime you want to make a call you either to do a quick search through your contacts or look through your call history to re-call that person.  Way too many button-pushes to make a call.Really nice concept.  Wifi worked okay, email (gmail) was hard to set up and didn't work most of the time.  When browsing the internet via wifi, constantly got \"not enough memory\" message even when browsing sites designed for mobile devices.Most recent annoyance is this message that comes and says \"New time zone detected.  Do you want to adjust the time base on this new time zone?\" (wording?)  This would happen when the phone was sitting on my desk and happened 10-12 times a day.***edit: Plus another negative is that since the unit comes from China (on a very slow boat, apparently) the wall charger is not UL approved.  It may or may not stop trying to charge the battery once it's fully charged.  Can you say 'Fire Hazzard'.  I always charged mine with the USB charger connected to my work PC.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "If WiFi and Java are features that you absolutely want, you can not go wrong with this.", "Author": "D.
