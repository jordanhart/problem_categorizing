{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice phone!", "Author": "Elsa Frettem", "ReviewID": "R3QVT2K37D2KBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although still too large, this is a nice one. Clear screen, good power, reception, etc.  Decent phone. Android 4.2.2Pretty sure it is refurbished. Fine by me since it has a new exterior and buttons and everything I interact with.Memory is small, but you can add a card, so problem solved.Mine came with two batteries (YAY) but I haven't needed the second one. If all you use is the phone, it lasts several days without charging. Bop into WiFI however, and you can hear the electrons draining.Oh yes, the instruction manual is silly.BEST OF ALLI don't have to worry about losing/breaking/not using it. For the price it is awesome!Highly recommend it.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "unhappy", "Author": "keshia ashton", "ReviewID": "R1VHLYPDFY8YR6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Did not work for my service like they said it would,slow not fast at all just horrible!!plus it takes forever to get it and no tracking", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "good deal", "Author": "Cindy", "ReviewID": "R2W5BGMY94LM4W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "every thing is good except for the power button fell off the second day other than that it is a good deal", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "i'm disapointed", "Author": "Jezarae Dominguez", "ReviewID": "R18O2F73E8KUMI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "it's keep fforcing everything to close, flash turns everything blueit be good if it would work....i jus am sad bout it", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00JFYXL5I"}}
