{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's A Good Phone!", "Author": "Guy", "ReviewID": "R3AP3N7U9EEBGY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for about a month.The phone was packaged with earphones, micro usb sync/charge cable, wall adapter, screen protector and case. It is a beautiful phone, even with the case it is as thin as a Number 2 Pencil, in my hand it feels sturdy and light. A few people have thought that it was the new iPhone.The phone started up smoothly and immediately recognized my t-mobile micro sim. I had full signal strength at HSDPA+(4G). The call quality is clear. The built in GPS is good it connects to satellites quickly when using the built navigation app or even a 3rd party GPS app. The cameras are good, they take clear pictures. I'm impressed by the 5MP front camera since that would be the rear camera on the cheaper Google Moto G. Obviously the rear camera can't match Galaxy S4 witch stands at 13MP since the rear camera is only 8, but i didn't just buy this phone for the camera. The battery will last the entire day so you don't have to worry about the phone dying midday. The battery charges slowly, but that may be because i don't use the wall adapter and i charge it primarily using my laptops usb port. The micro usb cable fits the phone snugly so it won't get disconnected unintentionally while your charging or syncing your phone.HSDPA+(4G) signal is capable of streaming internet radio apps(Pandora, TuneIn), play YouTube, Netflix without buffering. This phone has a built FM tuner, wired ear/headphones are required to act as the antenna.I like the phone resolution because you can't see individual pixels. I initially thought with just 1GB of ram I would be limited in running certain apps but that hasn't been the case, I am able to run Need for Speed, GTA, and Asphalt 8; so you are not just limited to 2D games. Using MX Player(app) i am able to watch hd videos 720p and 1080p, the videos play in sync, without lag, and doesn't get choppy. MX Player is able to play subtitles whether it's internal(mkv) or external. This phone Is also able stream media(photos, songs, videos) to DLNA and other media rendering devices like Smart Phones, Tablets, Blu-rays and Smart Tvs. Media streaming can be done via Twonky Beam(app) as long your phone and the device is on the same Wifi.Yes this phone does not support micro sd's, but i don't feeling limited by that since i am still given 12GB of usable internal/phone storage. I love music but i don't store any locally on the phone since i have a 32GB iPod touch, and also because for me that storage space is better for apps and videos. On average 1GB gives roughly 400-500 songs and most apps range 10MB-50MB, so you'll still be able a few thousand songs or a couple hundred apps. That is excluding 3D gaming apps because they can range from 200MB to 2GB. I Normally delete videos from the phone after watching them to free up space. You can find the Pandora, TuneIn, MX Player and Twonky Beam apps using the Play Store.Overall this is a good phone based on the value in contrast with the phones capabilities. I recommend this phone for the average user who would primarily use the phone for calling, web browsing, email and have about 1200 songs and 1 or 2 large gaming apps. This NOT the phone for someone with wants to store 8'000 songs or some who is a big gamer because of the storage, and the processing limitations.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Trenique", "ReviewID": "R26ACCV7RCUJJ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's great just wish I was told it doesn't take a sd card.
