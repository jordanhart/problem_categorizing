{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bought from Amazon.com / Comprado a Amazon.com", "Author": "Joel Bauer", "ReviewID": "RQBB6BYKDVOCK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally I got my new device and I can tell that it was all that I was expecting. I bought it from Amazon.com store (not another seller) and when the box arrived the first thing that I checked was the model number and it is RCM72UW, which works with 3G bands 850/1900/2100, so this is AT&T;, Rogers, Telus model...not T-Mobile model, so this is good news for me 'cause I use Movistar-Venezuela service. Well, to be honest I can not assure that Amazon.com will always be sending this particular model because they don't make any difference about the 3G compatibility and believe me 'cause I expend a lot of mails to customers service and they couldn't give me this detailed info. I took the risks and bought it anyway. Another info displayed on the box: Blackberry Bold 9780 Smartphone, 1256- Americas (Spanish) QWERTY-Black. Model RCM72UW, Made in Mexico. It comes with OS 6.0.0 Bundle 863. NOTE: Surprisingly it came with a 2GB microSD card already installed even when it wasn't published in the product details. Other info found checking in the options: active 3G bands 1, 2, 5 y 6. Searching in the internet I found that this means that it works with 3G bands 2100/1900/850/800. The box content is: 9780 device with plastic label protection on screen, battery cover, upper front (where it's printed \"Blackberry\"), camera lens and flash, leather pouch (the simple plane one, without belt clip, the leather looks like artificial type), earphones, battery, 5 feet USB cable (longer than the old one I had), standard wall charger with multiple international adapters (I was expecting ipod-like wall charger with female USB input, but it came with the usual one), Desktop software CD, user manual and some quick guides.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: According to several comments about this review I noticed that Amazon changed the product model number and description. As you can read in the page it says that the model is now RCN72UW (when I bought it the publication said it was RCM72UW and that was the phone I received). Now the product description is very specific and says that this phone works with T-Mobile's 3G network (1700/2100 MHz). I highly recommend to carefuly read all the information and descriptions published by Amazon in the product page so you can be certain of what you are buying.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Finalmente tengo mi nuevo telefono y puedo decir que es todo lo que estaba esperando. Lo compr\u00e9 de la tienda Amazon.com (no de otro vendedor) y cuando la caja me lleg\u00f3 lo primero que corrobor\u00e9 fue el modelo del telefono y dec\u00eda que es RCM72UW, que es el que trabaja con las bandas 3G 850/1900/2100 por lo que este telefono es la version AT&T;, Rogers, Telus, para Venezuela ser\u00eda Movistar y Movilnet, NO es la version T-Mobile, lo cual es excelente en mi caso ya que yo uso Movistar. Bueno, para ser honesto no podr\u00eda asegurar que Amazon.com despachar\u00e1 siempre este modelo o versi\u00f3n en particular ya que ellos no diferencian la compatibilidad 3G y creanme que gast\u00e9 un monton de emails al servicio de atencion al cliente preguntandoles y no me supieron dar los detalles. Yo asumi el riesgo y lo compr\u00e9 de todas maneras. Otra informaci\u00f3n que aparece en la caja: Blackberry Bold 9780 Smartphone, 1256- Americas (Spanish) QWERTY-Black. Model RCM72UW, Hecho en Mexico. Viene con el sistema operativo OS 6.0.0 Bundle 863. NOTA: Sorprendentemente vino con una tarjeta microSD de 2GB ya instalada, aun cuando no estaba publicado en los detalles del producto. Otra informaci\u00f3n que consegu\u00ed revisando las opciones: bandas 3G activas 1, 2, 5 y 6. Investigando en internet descubr\u00ed que esto significa que trabaja en las bandas 3G 2100/1900/850/800. El contenido de la caja es: celular 9780 con lamina plastica protectora en la pantalla,frontal superior (donde dice \"Blackberry\"), tapa de la bateria, lente de la camara y flash, forro de cuero (el mas simple de todos, sin clip para poner en la correa, el cuero parece artificial), audifonos, bater\u00eda, cable USB de 1,5 metros (mucho mas largo del que ten\u00eda antes), cargador de pared estandar con multiples adaptadores internacionales (estaba esperando uno con entrada USB hembra como el que usa el iPod, pero vino el mismo de siempre), CD con el Desktop sotware, manual de usuario y algunas guias rapidas.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Actualizaci\u00f3n: En vista de varios comentarios sobre esta nota, me di cuenta que Amazon cambi\u00f3 el modelo del producto y las descripciones. Como podr\u00e1n leer en la p\u00e1gina, ahora dice que el modelo es RCN72UW (cuando lo compr\u00e9 la publicaci\u00f3n dec\u00eda que era RCM72UW y ese fue el tel\u00e9fono que recib\u00ed). Ahora la descripci\u00f3n del producto es bastante espec\u00edfica y dice que este tel\u00e9fono trabaja con la red 3G de T-Mobile (1700/2100 MHz). Insisto en recomendarles que lean cuidadosamentetoda la informaci\u00f3n y descripciones publicadas por Amazon en la p\u00e1gina del producto para que as\u00ed puedan estar seguros de lo que est\u00e1n comprando.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Used hopefully not abused - Well very abused", "Author": "Cenergy", "ReviewID": "R2G609VOS1GWV1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone was advertised as brand new when i bought it in early January 2011. To my surprise, I switched it on to find a thread of love text messages from some guy back in Oct 2010 which obviously means it had been used. The phone does look brand new and currently works without any problems. It better stay that way considering how much $$$$ is splashed out for the device!!!!So after about one month, the key pad especially the BB button started malfunctioning. I tried to return the phone unfortunately, becos i moved to Africa shortly after the purchase, US customs made it difficult to return to seller. So i decided to cut my losses and buy a new key pad which i did. It worked better although for the BB button, it was still faulty. I then realized it was a problem not of the key pad, but in the underlying board.So i've had to live and struggle with the phone until yesterday when the screen went crazy. Now i cant see anything on the screen. I'm going to have to buy a new one.......Lesson learned.

The connector was changed but what a surprise when he tells me the connector has been fixed before and he assure me the telephone was a refurbish equipment. I purchased a brand new telephone from you and this is unaceptable.  I suggest you make a substantial adjustment to my account or I will see myself in the need to put this in higher hands.  2. The package did not contained an instruction book and I have requested it many times to Warm Mart and the keep going around in circles.  3. The CD with the software included do not work either it opens the first block and it get stocked there.

I've had an iPhone 3G, 3GS, and iPhone 4; a Nokia N8, Nokia N95, Nokia X2, Nokia C3, and now use a Nokia E6 concurrent with my Blackberry; and finally I have owned a Blackberry Curve and bought a Blackberry Bold 9780 about two months ago.The Blackberry Bold 9780 is a solid phone - built to last. It comes with a holster that works great at saving power (the phone idles when you put it in its case, unless you get a call). It has a great camera that takes wonderful pictures. The antenna is very strong and the reception brilliantly clear (depending on your carrier, of course). The new OS is smooth as silk and your email, applications, contacts, social network sites, and everything else you need can be integrated into the dock on the main screen. The battery life is astounding - you can go for three days without a charge if you make sporadic phone calls and regularly check email.If you like playing games on your phone, this will not be the phone for you. But if you want to take care of business and be able to use social networking sites, this is the best phone out there.

I understand that I bought a used phone, but it was described as being in \"good\" condition. If good condition means a battery that won't charge properly (has never fully charged, and it actually loses power when plugged in at times), a time setting that changes at random (my alarm was set for 7:30 am, so I could get some sleep before my final exam. The phone changed time zones and I was woken up at 3:30 am.), the apps I downloaded suddenly disappear, the casing was falling off, the plug that was sent along with the phone to recharge it has cable exposed. and the phone shuts off at random, often.What is worst, is that the seller is completely unprofessional and unhelpful. I have written SO MANY e-mails to this person asking for them to help resolve the problem- all the replies I have gotten have been late and really unhelpful. The seller wouldn't even write his name after he replied. Although the phone itself is clearly messed up, he asked me to send it back so I could get the replacement I asked for. This was really fishy, so I asked him to please send a replacement battery instead, as I didn't trust the situation. I never got the battery. The situation had already been dragging on for weeks, and I hardly heard back from him, so I wrote a negative review. He asked me to take this off of Amazon, and promised to send a replacement. I agreed. Did I ever get the phone? No. And I don't expect I will.Don't waste your time and money with this company. If you are going to make an investment in a product like this, at least make sure you are dealing with more reliable people who actually care about customer satisfaction.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone for a good price", "Author": "Asha", "ReviewID": "R332DMK081PPO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is really kool.

This means that: A = 2100 MHz 2 = 1900 MHz 4 = 1700 MHz 5 / 6 = 850 / 800 MHz 8 = 900 MHz", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "DISSATISFIED", "Author": "HANZ", "ReviewID": "R1OCWV391U6D86", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I AM DISSATISFIED WITH THE PURCHASE BECAUSE THE WINE EQUIPMENT WITH FLASH Imperfections in the camera, and I had to send to repairs where we realized that the phone was RECONTRUIDO AND IT WAS NOT ME AS NEW SOLD, SO MANIFEST DISCONTENT WITH PURCH", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blackberry Bold 9780", "Author": "Juan Venezuela", "ReviewID": "R2Q2LKE61A5JJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "El Celular llego en buen estado, con todo sus accesorios que se indicaba en la pagina, el tiempo me parecio bien 16 dias, pense que iva a tardar mas", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "GOOD", "Author": "carlos", "ReviewID": "RJI7GTSUSDN9C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very Good this product,Excelente aqui en venezuela funciona a la perfeccion en todss sus bandas.Very Good this product,Excelente aqui en venezuela funciona a la perfeccion en todss sus bandas.Very Good this product,Excelente aqui en venezuela funciona a la perfeccion en todss sus bandas.Very Good this product,Excelente aqui en venezuela funciona a la perfeccion en todss sus bandas.Very Good this product,Excelente aqui en venezuela funciona a la perfeccion en todss sus bandas.Very Good this product,Excelente aqui en venezuela funciona a la perfeccion en todss sus bandas.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bold", "Author": "claudio visani l", "ReviewID": "R3KUKLPLDQNRTI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone comes unlocked and ready to use once you insert your SIM card, I bought the one sold by AMAZON because its warranty and return policy is well worth a few more $$$, it works well in 3G with MOVISTAR Venezuela.

Everything works perfectly.Yes, to be able to configure your mail, twitter, facebook, blackberry messenger, and all the rest of the services the phone has, you need to enable the blackberry services with your provider (yes, you need to pay).I am not too informed about band systems for phones but since it worked here, I would assume it works with GSM 850/900/1800/1900MHz and HDSPA (3G) 2100MHz/1900MHz/850MHz.I read on the reviews this was the T-Mobile version.

It is a good phone, great, classic keyboard that Blackberry uses love, and the trackpad, replacing the trackball. While the phone itself is pretty great, it is a little pricey for what it can do compared with competitors, but it is marketed as a corporate phone, with the secure BIS/BES email integration. It lacks what most smartphones have these days, in terms of both hardware and software, which makes this another outdated phone.HARDWARE:The phone comes with a 624 MHz processor and 512 MB ram, which seems very small and outdated, but works well for basics. However, whenever the phone pauses, it has a small clock, freezes the whole phone & waits until the CPU can cope again, which really does drive me crazy when downloading from app world & browsing the web, and having to pause every 5 seconds for the phone to refresh.The phone itself seems very classy, with a leather back. However, the thickness makes it feel quite bulky, but it does help protect from numerous drops from myself. The phone comes with an expandable microSD slot, 3.5mm headphones & charges via a miniUSB port. At the top is a lock button, and a mute/pause button. It comes with volume buttons & 2 changeable 'Convenience keys.'The battery is a standard Li-Po 1500 mAh, which can get you through a standard day, but I find it with constant use, the battery life lasts between 7 - 12 hours, even shorter when using the GPS.The camera is a 5MP camera, with autofocus & a LED flash. I find it takes alright, quick shots, but it does become very grainy in low light & macro shots, so don't think it is a camera-replacing phone at all.It comes with GSM, CDMA, EDGE, HDSPA, 3G etc, not having any 4G LTE funky-stuff, but does mean that you can use it around the world. The software lets you tether it to a windows/mac pc via USB cable, but can not Bluetooth/Wifi Hotspot anything like a tablet.The Display is 480 x 360 pixels, 2.44 inches with a 246 ppi, which is quite high, compared to alot of phones, however many high-end phones are starting to catch up with the iPhone's 330 ppi 'Retina Display'. The Display is good, but is quite small and it not good for anyone with poor eyesight.The phone is controlled by 5 'buttons' which seem very numerous and is starting to also leave RIM behind. From left to right, its the Green Call button, which brings up call history, picks up calls etc, then the Blackberry Symbol Menu Button, which brings up a massive list of options, which is quick and compact, but is becoming outdated and is leaving the OS behind, yet again. The middle is a trackbad, which is a good replacement to the trackball, or a normal 5-way pad (like the Kindle). Next is the back button, which goes back the previous page & terminates programs, and the Red Hand up/Power button, Which comes back to the home page without terminating programs, rejects/hangs up calls & turns the phone on/off.It also comes with an LED front notification light, which flashes when you have a notification, which comes as a basis of all blackberry's. Although it is changeable, you need a third-party app in order to do so.SOFTWARE:It comes with BB OS 6.0.x, a pretty good overhaul from BB os 5, but it does has it's drawbacks, compared to iOS, Android and Windows Phone.The lock screen is very basic, nothing fancy like any other operating systems, which leads to the main interface. The whole phone is controlled by the track pad & the 4 buttons. The thing I love about the interface is the Notification center, which draws down & compiled all notifications for you. Below is the All page, which holds all the programs in one section, but can be distributed into sections when you slide across into Favourite, Frequent, Downloads & Media.The OS is quite snappy and fast, but lacks any massive GPU, which then restricts gaming to pretty much basic snake etc. The app world has very limited apps, with little games, and missing vital free apps, like adobe reader etc.Multitasking is a breeze, holding the Blackberry Button, but it does freeze up the phone if too much is happening at once. The OS is also quite smooth, but does delay if too much pressure on the phone at once.It also doesn't have Wifi Hotspot/Bluetooth Tethering capabilities, unlike Android/WP/iOS, which is a massive letdown, as a wifi tablet user. It does, however, tether via USB to windows/mac, which works well, with the software with the Blackberry.It also doesn't have flash, which annoys me also. People may argue flash is a memory hog & is slow & sluggish, it still does have a big part in the web at the moment, and until HTML5 becomes as good as flash, flash is still a necessity.It comes with BBM, which gives free messages across Blackberry devices, which is why my friend wanted me to get one in the first place. It used to be a massive selling point, but now with iMessage, and android alternatives, this is also slowly sliding away from RIM as well.CONCLUSION:So, this phone is great for social networking, emails, texting, basic web browsing etc. Although it has little CPU/RAM power, the OS works great when little pressure is applied to it. However, for the price, unless you want a keyboard or the secure BES/BIS email intergration, you had better steer clear, or grab something like the curve/pearl.PROS/CONS:Pros:- Secure Email- Great keyboard for long typing- Comes with BBM- Zippy OS- Good ppi density.- Comes with microSD card slot.- Versatile connectivity around the world.- Alright camera, good for basic snaps.Cons:- Small Battery Life- No tethering wifi/bluetooth support- Can't withstand alot of multitasking.- Small App Selection- Very little gaming.- Can feel a little bulk", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "my bb bold 9780-great buy", "Author": "kertaj catise", "ReviewID": "R2BLITAIUWY0EP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought this as a secondary phone to my iphone 3gs and its not iphone but its really good in my opinion. its durable i still have it, i have had no problems with it. i bought it directly from amazon. i had one day shipping done cuz i live in the caribbean and the person taking to me was living in wisconsin and boarding their flight the next day. it arrived on time. u get a very nice leather case which is durable which is a good bonus", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cellphone with problems", "Author": "vallito2000", "ReviewID": "R3D487HWR8P1MU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone has problems.

It seems as if, the iPhone is the greatest phone ever, and nothing can ever compare to its simplicity, and vast array of features. When in fact, the iPhone 4, and the Blackberry Bold 9780 have practically the same features. Despite the front camera, the iOS, Retina Display, capacitative touch screen, and ability to be held portrait or landscape, their features are quite similar. The general truth about consumers and their Apple smartphones is \"People use smartphones to do dumb things.\" The Geico Insurance commercial that publicized this quote, spoke the truth. The major difference between the iPhone 4 and the Blackberry Bold 9780, is that operating the Blackberry requires a sufficient level of intelligence, and or patience.When I acquired the device 7 months ago, I discovered the similarities within the iPhone and this particular item.The similarities within the iPhone 4 and the Blackberry Bold 9780 are the following:-The iPhone 4, vowed by Apple Engineers as the most innovative iPhone yet, has a 5 megapixel camera with HD recording and flash as well.-Both devices can acquire applications, the iPhone through the App Store, and the Blackberry Bold 9780 through the Blackberry App World. Unfortunately, at the moment, the Blackberry App World, has less innovative applications. Both the iPhone and the Blackberry have MP3, and MP4 playback capabilities.-Like the iPhone, the Blackberry Bold 9780, can be highly productive, but a Blackberry is not as fun to operate. In productivity, all Blackberry devices amplify the reach of businesses with applications similar to the iPhone.-In shopping, for the iPhone you may or may not have seen the commercial where you can scan a barcode of a product and compare prices, but what I discovered through curiosity, is that the Blackberry Bold 9780, embodies the same capability through an application called Scope (available through the Blackberry App World for free).The Blackberry Bold 9780 is also able to: (in parenthesis are the names of the applications available)-check the weather around the world through a variety of applications (Weatherbug or Poynt or Weather.com),-block phone calls (Mr. Number),-be tracked down for free if lost or stolen then have the location sent to the local police department (offered by Blackberry Protect),-download music (Amazon MP3 Store),-listen to the radio stations across the country online (iHeart Radio),-share files and documents from your computers or devices (Dropbox),-watch and upload YouTube videos,-create and or export Microsoft Word Documents ($14.99),-be synchronized and back up your data to your computer (Blackberry Desktop Software),-view attachments on e-mails,-synchronize Facebook friends to your contact lists,-provide Global Positioning Services for free (Blackberry Maps),-bank online (Wells Fargo Mobile, TD Bank, Bank of America Mobile, etc.),-edit photos (Photo Editor),-provide names to random phone numbers that call your phone even if they are not in your contacts (Mr. Number),-conduct conference calls,-plan a vacation, trip, or book a flight or hotel (Blackberry Travel),-catch up with the latest news headlines,-stay current on the latest sports news (Sports Illustrated),-make a list of reminders or a to do list (Tasks),-translate phrases spoken in different languages to English or other languages (iSpeech),-send messages with emoticons,-chat with friends on Facebook (Free Chat for Facebook),-complete crosswords by the NY Times (The New York Times Crosswords),-keep a record of your finances, (Pageonce - Money and Bills),-check the viewer ratings and show-times for movies playing in theaters (Flixter),-find the definition of words and provide other suggestions (Dictionary.com App),-change the font style and sizes to ease messages etc. with additional options for Bold, Extra-Bold, or Italic,-check inbox, write e-mails from up to 10 e-mail addresses,-shop online (Ebay),-convert worldwide currencies (Oanda Currency Converter),-check traffic conditions on highways (Blackberry Traffic),-back up contacts and messages over the air,-receive and send files through Bluetooth technology,-store and encrypt passwords (Password Keeper),-update Facebook status (Facebook),-post tweets (Twitter),-synchronize data through wi-fi,-read ebooks downloaded onto your Amazon Kindle (Amazon Kindle App),-play BrickBreaker,-communicate with other Blackberry users across the globe (BlackBerry Messenger),-switch through Applications,-can disconnect from your wireless network and make VoIp calls using your mobile number if connected to a wi-fi network..................... and the list keeps goingOverall, the iPhone 4 and the Blackberry Bold 9780, embody similar features. Unfortunately, the product description provided by Amazon, does not do the device justice. Just look at the product profile pages for Apple products, it looks like nothing else can compare, but the problem is, not even the manufacturers of these other smartphones and consumer electronics with the exception of Apple seem to believe in their product or advertise its features proficiently.DESIGN AND QUALITY-------------------When it comes to the design and quality of the product, I admire it's elegance. A Blackberry from my perspective accompanies the most elegant and classy designs. Take the leather Blackberry Door for example. I find it that the only thing that compares to its design, is the iPhone. The Droids are huge, and so are the HTC Androids. I really think that having a phone with a 4-inch screen is too huge. Then the other androids look extremely cheap. And Samsung, is suspicious because according to a recent lawsuit Apple filed, they copied the features and feel of their products.With the Blackberry 6 Software, the phone already looks sharp, but if you don't like it for some reason, you can buy themes that have even better graphics. You can also find free themes, that's what I did after I got tired of the design.When it comes to quality, I really like how the Blackberry has added grip to it, I've only dropped it a few times, and nothing has ever happened. Overall, it's extremely sturdy, and I really like the battery life of the device.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelente", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R32RR6N0VAZO2K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "El producto es de excelente calidad, totalmente nuevo.
