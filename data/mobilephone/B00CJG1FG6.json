Calls come clear as well as text I have no complaints since I know what I purchased.Was not looking for cell I would not be mad if lost or stolen. I just put in both sim cards and had service on the phone right away, I have the option of having both sim cards work at the same time or just one depending on the country/carrier I choose to use.It has a camera radio and flashlight but I don't really care for those since I just wanted a PHONE that would take the place of two cells.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic phone and service!!!", "Author": "Timothy A.", "ReviewID": "R15E19YFWLXCFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It exceeds my expectations, who ever designed this type of phone, knoew what they were doing, very easy, and fun to use, and at a super great price, what else does a person need.

Had to hunt and peck on the internet to find out how to open it and install the battery and a sim card.  So a bit frustrating at first.Now we have used it on 6 different countries and it works ok.  We only use it for calling.  No texting blue tooth etc. If it gets lost or stolen no big deal.  Heck we already got our ones worth out of it.The major annoying thing is not being able to increase the volume to hear.  If we get a call on the street with traffic almost impossible to hear.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "james lovett", "ReviewID": "R2VN20L8L8ZXH2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this works like  a charm,love the fm radio.i can enjoy music when i travel to friends and family.hope to order another one real soon.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "you get what you pay for, but...", "Author": "Boris", "ReviewID": "R1XL9XWQC6LV2N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "you get what you pay for, but... pretty good simple phone for the price.Sound quality - not the best, but acceptable.

I have already broken 2 nails in attempting it. Obviously I don't want to damage it in any way, especially if it should turn out that I have te return it. But,  PLEASE tell me how to open it.
