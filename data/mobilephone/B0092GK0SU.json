Marshall", "ReviewID": "R1LLUHYVP1N6IT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my wife who wanted a small tablet to put in her purse. She likes playing games, getting on Facebook, and texting throughout the day. She had an Android phone with a small screen, so she was already accustomed to the interface. Since her old phone was acting up, I thought I would kill 2 birds with 1 stone so to speak by investing in the Note. She loves the phone and the fact that she doesn't need 2 devices to carry around is awesome. The graphics quality is excellent!Since I just purchased this, I knew it was a couple generations old. Quite frankly, I hate contracts and renewing for 2 years every time I want a new phone, so I am on the new AT&T; plan that has no contract. Of course that means I buy every device outright. With that being said, I can't afford the latest and greatest phone, so I was a little concerned about screen resolution, processor speed, etc. Overall, I am very pleased with the exception of the battery life. Plan on spending an extra $20 for a longer life battery. I have seen some that are really thick and require a different backplate, but there are others that don't require that.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0092GK0SU"}}
