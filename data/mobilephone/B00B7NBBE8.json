Went to AT&T; service center and they refused to help me stating they can not troubleshoot unlocked phones. I then went to T-Mobile and they were happy to help.

My phone storage space starts off at about 0.98GB after a fresh Factory Data Reset and drops daily on its own by about 20-120MB per day. Then when it is less than 5mb I can no longer receive text messages or use any apps.I installed a 16GB micro SD card and in settings>storage>storage location I have set it to External Storage Card..I did this after doing a fresh \"Factory Data Reset\".No matter what I do. Phone storage space drops daily by 50-120MB per day and there is no way for me to see what this data is and erase it. I am not even a heavy internet user as my data plan limits me to 1GB per month. I have been using this phone a little under a month now and have not exceeded my 1GB. Does this phone just make up bad data to fill memory?How do I solve this problem? Also this phone should have come with 4GB not 0.98GB.I also experience the echo problem in the comments on here. I can find no other wired headset that works with the phone besides the one that comes with it. This phone is a real pain.NO HEADSET WORKS ON THIS PHONE BESIDES THE ONE THAT COMES WITH IT! I have purchased multiple 3.5 mm ear buds and head phones etc....none work....sound quality is very low and lacking most sound details. I contacted Blu and they said the phone only supports MONO headsets...(this was popular in the 60s). So I purchased mono head phones in the store and on ebay, the one I got on ebay did not work and the one i got at the store works but the volume is low. The head phones that came with my phone are worn out and there is no way i can find to replace them. I have spent so much money on different head pieces...might as well have bought those high costing S4 or HTC 1.Also, sometimes i have to restart phone after each individual text for them to go through. Or, if the phone stops receiveing phone calls I have to restart the phone. I have missed many calls because of this and these missed calls dont show up in call log!!!", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Some Issues with 3.5mm AUX Jack", "Author": "C. Hua \"A Student\"", "ReviewID": "R3K6J9I1R9TK16", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall, this is one of the most powerful phones I have ever owned, but being slightly unrecognized as a brand, it lacks technical support, but more importantly, lacks active community involvement in the Android development community.  As a stock device however, you cannot go wrong for the spec and price.  All my reviews start at 5 stars and get dinged down per inconvenience that I will detail here (for any first-time Android users, please read my notes about the Motorola XT860 Milestone 3 phone to understand better the general expectations between an iPhone vs. Android user; essentially works out of the box vs. person who wants to modify the phone):Ding 2 stars: Dysfunctional auxiliary 3.5mm audio jackI think this is a new feature in most phones as none of my old phones have had this issue.  In all my old devices, including a few iPhones, if you are playing music or taking a call, and suddenly plug in an external stereo device like a car stereo into the phone via the 3.5mm auxiliary jack, you immediately get sound output to your external device.  However, this phone, along with another phone I tried at the same time, do not detect aux cables at all.  If you plug in any form of headset, or external handset, the phone will pick it up.  If you want to get external output to your stereo through the 3.5mm jack, you need to go to settings > sound > Enable Hi-Fi mode, every time you connect a cable to the jack.  This is massively inconvenient.  However, most people I talk to do not even use a cable anymore and stream audio via Bluetooth.  I have no idea if this is a new trend in smartphones, but it seems massively backwards to me.  The best audio comes from a cable, not Bluetooth, and the need to manually kickstart the external audio output by toggling this setting is extremely inconvenient.  The software EQ is pretty bad too.  Even after maxing out the EQ to 12dB and my car stereo up, there is still a lot to be desired when you blast the music ... but it's ok when listening to a Zen talk podcast ... I really want my Droid 4 but can't for reasons I'll talk about next.<--added on 10/11/13-->I contacted Blu about their audio jack and they confirmed the issue is not newer tech or the version of Android in use.  Instead, it is because the Blu Quattro uses a mono (TS) 3.5mm aux port, which is not compatible with stereo 3.5mm devices.  Basically, good for headsets but no support on handsets and most stereo-out applications.  I ordered a handful of 3.5mm stereo to mono plug converters to see if at a minimum, I can convert the mono output of the phone, to something that can be played on external speakers more directly without using the hi-fi mode, which doubles up the signal to provide a pseudo stereo out.  Apparently adding in a fully stereo or TRRS capable aux jack would have pushed production cost way up on this phone.  That said, this means the phone is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SQUARE/PAYPAL/CARD READERS!  I have to manually input card swipes, which is a huge burden.  I will probably re-purpose an older phone specifically for Square Reader use.Ding 1 Star: Packaging ProblemThe box is kind of dumb, has a huge logo that says support for 32GB SD.  But this is only for the D440 model, which sports a IPS display and Gorilla Glass screen, both first generation.  This version uses second generation IPS and Gorilla Glass, but non-removable battery, only 16GB internal storage, and has an 8Mp cam instead of 4Mp in the D440.  Also, be careful of this SIM chip port.  It falls out easily if you drop/hit the phone.  Also, it does not have a push pin to push it out like the iphone.  The pin instead, is used to pry it open.  I broke a paperclip pushing and pushing and pushing.  Oh yeah, this phone lacks any front facing indicator lights to blink on missed calls/messages.  I'm not too keen on that.  I might have to look for an app that pulses the LED from the camera flash or something to see if it will work.+1 Star: IPS Version 2, OMGThe difference between this D450 and the lower end D440 is the IPS display, glass, and the camera.  The D450 has a second generation IPS display as well as second generation gorilla glass screen.  I will say that the gamma on an IPS display is a little too high for my taste compared to the pentile displays from OLED that I've used.  But the clarity of the image easily rivals if not beats the iPhone retina display.  I might have to find an app to reduce gamma though, because the colors are just slightly too bright for me.  But they are beautiful - maybe more true to life than what I'm used to.+1 Star: ATT MEdia NET CompatibleUnlocked, International phone, not in the ATT database, qualifies this phone for $10/mo. unlimited data w/ tethering through the built-in ICS module.  You buy this phone if you want to \"stick it to the man\" and not pay the exorbitant data fees and tethering fees.  I seriously don't understand why you would charge an access fee to tether.  You bought X gigabytes for the month, it shouldn't matter what device consumes it.  Go Verizon if you want legit and clean data.+1 Star: Mostly Stock AndroidBeing non-branded, Blu Products did not want to try to establish itself as a software developer jamming as much of their custom carrier software into these phones.  They kept it really close to stock, with few to no bulk applications.  This phone, once rooted, becomes extremely powerful for the power user.  The best way to root this phone is to use the XDA Developer root tool by Bin4ry, version 31 at the time of this writing.  It is the cleanest way to root or un-root as needed.  SRS One Click currently does not work for the D450 but will work for the D440.  Btw, you will need the ADB USB driver for this to work.  However, Blu does NOT provide this driver.  To get this, just install the trial version of PDANet from the PDANet website.  In the process, when you plug in the phone, PDANet will install a generic ADB USB driver so you can connect the phone via USB to root.Summary:-2 For the Stupid Audio Jack Problem-1 for unusual packaging and sim card access+1 for the IPS display+1 for the mostly stock Android+1 for being unlocked, medianet capable (pentaband GSM/UMTS/WCDMA, woohoo!)In sum, it's still a damn good phone. I need someone to hack the audio jack for me now.  Lastly, because this is such an unknown company, there aren't any custom cases. ZERO. None, NADA, and there never will be.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "memory and connection", "Author": "jason", "ReviewID": "R2KJDYVBRLYWVQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After downloading my apps the phone came up with low memory I contacted the seller who after numerous e mails they finally said its a problem with the phone and to get a replacement or refund I must ship the phone back and when they receive it then it will take a further 3-5 days before anything can be done so there is no telling when exactly that will be total crap", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Haven't had much time to play with it, but here are some first impressions...", "Author": "Kris", "ReviewID": "R2MMFHTCB9ME6K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the same price as the Nexus 4, you get a phone that's twice as good. I'm not kidding. I've had this piece of crap Nexus 4 for 8 months now, and I expected the BLU to only be an incremental step up (purchased it as a gift for a friend overseas). Turns out it isn't only 10x the phone this Nexus 4 is, it's also visibly better than almost every Android phone on the market. It doesn't have all the crapware most phone manufacturers put on their phones. They have the same speed as the Samsung Galaxy S3  (Samsungs really have some of the worst build quality out there), and in the comparison I've done, there is no noticeable difference between the Samsung Galaxy S4 and this phone. The SGS4 has a better screen, sure, but it's also more than twice the price and build like a sad toy.All in all, for this price you can't beat this phone. For $600...just by this phone and then BLU's new phone in 6 months.BLU may be a hidden gem in the cell phone industry, but I'm glad for it. Keeps the prices down for me.

Be it on xda, android forums, etc. You will find little support for an identical phone called the K-Touch V8, but that's mostly a non-english speaking community.The reason why I was let down was because the phone constantly kept crashing on me.

I had a hard time to root it but was able to finally get it rooted. What I dislike is the way blu installs the screen protector themselves on the phone. They do such a TERRIBLE job that the screen protector has pockets of air and dust and only option was to remove the screen protector and trash it. Next time, include the screen protector and LET THE USER INSTALL IT. I would do a much better job... they obviously did not care whatsoever when they installed itBox is also not sealed and it almost feels like the phone was not totally new... I guess they must receive stock from China and install and package the item in the US before they sell it. It des not feel like you're getting a brand new phone...Also keep in mind that with those king of cheap phones you get what it comes with. Don't expect any software updates. It comes with an old ICS build 4.0.4 and that's probably all it will come with from the company unless you are brave enough to install new ROM yourself...Even though I really like this phone, I am getting a Google Nexus 4 instead.
