{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Affordably priced Samsung dual sim phone", "Author": "Jeffrey A \"Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "R11NHRPUT0LKBP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Samsung Ch@t C322 dual sim phone is easy to set up and use.  It gives you access to two sim cards/networks with a single handset.  So, if you use two sim cards then you need a dual sim phone. (Your sim cards can be on the same network/service provider or on two different networks).The Samsung Ch@t C322 is certainly no smart phone.  So if you are looking for WiFi, iOS, Droid etc then continue shopping :((PROS:Most important for me is the Samsung Ch@t C322 long battery life.  Even with the Bluetooth on, the phone battery lasts days!The phone is ultra easy to setup and use.It's even easier to setup if your old phone was a Samsung - if so, you can Bluetooth all your contact information to the Samsung Ch@t C322.Switching  from one sim to another on the Samsung Ch@t C322 is so easy - Simply press the sim switch at the right of the phone and you've switched networks for outgoing calls.You can save data on the phone memory or on a micro SD. A budget priced 2GB micro SD is more than adequate if you are using the micro SD mainly to back up your phone contacts.The Samsung Ch@t C322 allows each sim/network to be customized with its own ringtone, wallpaper and color theme.  So, at a glance you can see what network sim is currently your default for outgoing calls.The QWERTY keyboard (albeit tiny) is convenient for texting - I prefer a physical keyboard over a touchscreen to text.A fun feature with Samsung phones is, by turning on the Bluetooth, messages can be sent between phones via Bluetooth, of course, without having any network charges!By simply pressing a switch at the left of the phone, you activate a fake call feature.  Your phone 'calls you' a little later.  I love knowing this feature - certainly an ace up my sleeve when I really need that Kit Kat break! :))CONS:The screen is small, the keyboard buttons tiny, the camera is 1.3MP ... But whoa! This is no smart phone!  You won't be disappointed if you are purchasing this simply as a user friendly utilitarian dual sim phone.Beware, if you frequently take calls in noisy settings, then you may have to use a headset - the speakerphone is much too soft!The Auto lock setting once selected locks the phone too quickly.  This can be annoying at times!I give the Samsung Ch@t C322 phone 4 STARS  - It is overall a great buy.Check around on Amazon for the best deal on this phone.Hope my review was helpful ...Jeffrey A.

From the owner's guide through the language set is a complete misery.No way that I can set anything with that. What is more was that I paid $110 dollars to ship it to my home country Angola. And it was intended for a gift to one of my niece's birthday.It was sold by Wireless Everything and I assume they knew that. But you know everything could happen and the misfortune was me.Just need them to fix it but they have told me that if I called them they will set the language. I'm in Angola about 16000 miles away from US and phone call are extremely expensive.How come could it happen?", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005EHFCGG"}}
