(even after rooting the phone)* the weight - very light (even with case I've bought)* the size - 4.5 in. is just perfect (for me) :-)* the fact that it arrived with many languages installed (incl. Hebrew)* it has 8MP cameraI dislike about this cellphone:* the fact that it doesn't have a hardware key for home button. it is nessacery when you want to see the screen during a phone-call.* the power button seems a little fragile and non-professional (unlike the whole cell-phone)I dislike about peripherals:* the fact that it's very hard to find cases to this cellphone - the variety is very small* same goes with screen protector. It's very hard to find non-reflecting (matte) one. and when i did find one, it cost more than similar-size cellphones's screen-protectors.P.S.I'm using it for about a month.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't want to spend Apple or Samsung prices on a smartphone?
