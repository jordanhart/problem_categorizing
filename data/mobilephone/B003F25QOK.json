{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone for traveling, and more", "Author": "Don Tobi", "ReviewID": "RJ1GJU19HORU6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for international travel, because getting SIM cards abroad is typically a lot cheaper than roaming.  It has served me well on a recent long trip to Europe and Africa.  With my prepaid Verizon US phone slowly breaking apart, I will probably use the C3050 at home too with AT&T; prepaid.I'm very happy with the phone.  The voice quality is great, it has an FM tuner, music player and a very basic camera too.  I also like the design.  In short, it's a great phone that does what I need it to do, does it very well, and for a good price.There are some \"interesting\" things to note about my phone though:  When I power it on, it hails from Vodafone.  It came in a box labeled \"Sansung\" (yes, with an \"n\"!).  It didn't have a manual.  The power plug is European style.  The volume settings for FM and music playback are somewhat on the loud side.  And the cover over the micro USB slot that's used for the included headset, or for charging, looks flimsy, but it has held up without any actual problems.Even though the list of quirks is a bit lengthy, this is still a solid, basic, unlocked, quad-band, gsm phone.  Which is exactly what I wanted.  I would get it again without hesitation.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simple Solution", "Author": "Jonathan", "ReviewID": "R1MG4KV2NQFZWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this 4 band GSM phone to use abroad when AT&T; wanted a fortune to activate my iPhone for use abroad.  This phone and a $30 SIM card and I was in business.  It works perfectly.  The battery holds its charge well.  And the menus are simple to navigate.  Until the big phone providers come around and let a person use their own phone abroad, this seems like an inexpensive and reasonable solution.  The product arrived on time and in brand new condition with all necessary components including a USA adaptor for the charger.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good basic phone But.....", "Author": "D.

Everything else is EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED! Yes, seriously. Voice quality is great, connection is stable, battery life is good. Small enough to fit into your palm. Connects to a number of bluetooth devices without problems. What else? It comes with earphones (never used), someone might appreciate that too.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent, But...", "Author": "SoBeBum", "ReviewID": "ROXURDULASK0P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just returned from the overseas trip for which I purchased this phone.  Here are my thoughts:Like other reviewers, I chose to get this phone to house a SIM card so I can call/be called like a local in my travels.  It works well for that purpose: call quality and signal reception were solid and reliable.Also like other reviewers, I received a phone that had a charger for a foreign electrical system.  In my case, it was a British electrical plug.  If you are not familiar with the British electric system, be aware that all of their plugs require enormous 3-pronged monstrosities, of the type used to operate clothes dryers and other high-wattage devices in the U.S.  Happily, someone at the seller's end was nice enough to slap on a British-to-U.S. adapter. Sadly, this meant that for use on Continental Europe, I had to assemble a 3-piece mess that was larger than the phone itself: Phone to British power cord; British-to-U.S. adapter, U.S.-to-European adapter.  Bottom line: it is ugly and bulky, but it works.The phone was in brand-new condition (or appeared so), with protective scratch-guard plastic on its top, front, and camera panel.The battery held a charge quite well - 6+ days in standby mode.Relatively straightforward user interface; customizable to a satisfactory level.Crappy, bad-old-days non-standard audio jack; it comes with a wired hands-free headset, but you'll never find another one that fits into its plug.Construction seems pretty solid; some play in the rails between the front and rear faces when it is extended.No \"airplane mode\" - you either turn it completely off, or the wireless system will keep seeking a signal. No playing Tetris on the long flight home (at least, not legally).Didn't use music or FM radio functions, so I can't comment on their quality.In conclusion, this is a decent cellphone that dates from before the iPhone 1 unleashed the smartphone tidal wave; it is useful as an inexpensive host for swap-able SIM cards when you are gallivanting around beyond your cell phone's reach. It has a few warts, however, that prevent it from being a 5-star solution.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "a competent GSM phone w/out vibrate", "Author": "E. Gabber \"software engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R1WNDLRU87IG4H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used this phone with a prepaid SIM card in France without any trouble using the SFR cellular carrier. The phone is compact and the menus are easy to navigate. The phone arrived with a charger for British power outlets, and an adapter that allowed it to plugged to North American power outlets. You will need suitable adapters to charge it in other countries. The phone came with a slim instruction booklet in English which was sufficient.The only problem I found is the lack of vibrate mode. I could not hear the phone ringing when it was in my pocket while riding congested trains or walking on busy streets in Paris. A vibrate mode would have alerted me to the calls.Updated on December 2012: I used the phone in Poland without any trouble using the Orange cellular carrier.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works in France", "Author": "scipiocd@yahoo.com", "ReviewID": "RQVJMUZDAEN9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to use it in France. I loaded the contacts from our USA phone thru bluetooth and it worked at first trial. I bought an Orange SIMM for E15 (E5 credit at the first charge) at the Paris Montparnasse train station on arrival. The phone number is sent in a text message whithin a few minutes of loading the card. A helpful clerk charged minutes at a shop in the small town where we were staying. I had to call the credit card company in the USA and the credit went fast, but we received calls from our family in the USA even after the credit was gone, so calls from the USA were free for us. The phone was very useful and it worked very well for the purpose we needed, just a phone. It worked so well that I bought another one of the same so my wife and I can communicate if we need to be separated for any reason while being abroad.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Liittle Phone", "Author": "Amazon08", "ReviewID": "R3T36CDOCW1G20", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone does what it claims. It is made of durable materials, it is very practical and its features, however basic, do what they are supposed to do. It is nice little device to take with you when travelling abroad, particularly, to the Third World where people stalk tourists to steal from them especially Smart Phones, and in many instances, kill them to get these devices too. The great feature abuot this phone is that it is Unlocked, so you can use it everywhere you go, helping you lay low. You simply go to the local phone carrier wherever you are, and buy the SIM Card to make your calls and receive them as well.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "just fine ....", "Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "RNDCV0L2VUOQS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Its smaller than it looks but we like it , works fine and its simple , good for the $$, wish it had more sound options.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good quality phone", "Author": "Felicia", "ReviewID": "R1U0TDWCRB8DUB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone and it came on time and the features it professed to have were indeed there. The battery life lasted about three days or more according to what it was being used for. The radio quality was excellent and one did not have to be searching to find radio signals, the phone did that for you, but using the radio is a feature that diminishes the battery power quite easily. The phone is sturdily built and the quality over all is good, the only two negatives are that the phone needs to be updated with wifi to keep with the times and secondly i did not get to keep this phone long as it was stolen from me at work. I guess i was not the only one loving it, so for those who wish to purchase this, go right ahead just keep it on you at all times. lol", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$89.99", "Features": "Compact size fits in your purse or back pocket\nBackground Music Play provides easy listening\nPanoramic shots with integrated VGA camera", "Name": "Stratus Quadband GSM Phone (Unlocked)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51l7XSsmIFL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003F25QOK"}}
