The larger screen make it more confortable than iphone5.BTW, HUAWEI is actually one of the largest communication equipment suppilier (to mobile companies) in Europe if not the single largest one.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Android Device", "Author": "319swimrun", "ReviewID": "RZHLFAKM3DYVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone, I actually ordered mine and had it shipped from China, before it was available here So I've used it for several months now. The seller even rooted it on request. This phone is great.-The Display is perfect as far as brightness - auto dimming etc are concerned. Resolution is just right for the screen size.-Usually I dislike overlays by manufacturer but Huawei really did well with the Emotion UI. It is very adjustable and functional and also smooth.-The Enhanced security for push notifications and app management is really great.-Power management modes are also wonderful. While it might get down to below 30 percent. Enabling \"Endurance\" mode elongated the remaining battery life.-The Camera is amazing. Video chat is spectacular with the 5Mp front facing camera. Huawei includes a easy to use editing suite.-I've heard people saying that the performance was poor but I can say that I have not experienced that in the slightest. It is good to understand your phone is a small computer and thus should be managed as one. Neglecting the amount of background apps installed will always degrade your battery life and performance no matter what phone you use.I don't have any storage issues as I use a very large SD card anyway.The looks of this phone were its biggest selling point. The brushed aluminum just looks awesome. The rounded bottom gives the it a unique feature that.. gets the response \"That is not an iphone... What is that??\"Its heavier than you'd expect but its a great weight to feel. Having dropped it on the concrete from about 3 feet, two separate times I can say that its also very rugged. Haven't cracked the glass and barely scratched the edges.Cons.No NFC, No LTEmeh  42Mb/s HSPA+ is fast enough..", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "\u7740\u5b9e\u60ca\u8273\u4e86\u4e00\u628a", "Author": "Ian Rock", "ReviewID": "R2W9S2A0X0K5XY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Definitly a great phone in terms of look, make, and hardware.

Doesn't have optical image stabilizer.-Not much default widgets provided by company, limited theme.-Average speaker quality.-Phone can heat up if used extensively for gaming. Though I haven't noticed any heating for any other use.-Screen is not Full HD-Cannot keep up with other phones like HTC one or Nexus 5 in terms of performance, though this wouldn't be an issue if not used for gaming.-I noticed some lag in keyboard response, though I am an incredibly fast typer on phone, this could be just me, but definitely not as good as iOS's keyboard.Low quality (1/5)-Horribly located earphone jack (on bottom left pointing left to the left of phone) it would be a great hassle putting the phone in the pocket while headphone is attached.-Bad location for USB connection (top) if used for mounting on stereo equipments, phone would be upside down!-Very unpredictable exposure metering in the front camera, It is very center weighted so a black object at the center can completely cause the image to be over exposed.-The app menu is removed, all the apps by default has to be on the desktop! This might get fixed by updating to kitkat.Overal I think it is an excellent choice for people who don't use the phone for gaming, looking for moderately priced, stunning looking phone that can provide just about anything that high-end android phones like htc one or S4 offer. I would definitely recommend this phone.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "ligther and quicker, the camera is better than other.", "Author": "Omar A Santos D", "ReviewID": "R35T8P8QGN3F4M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "ligther and quicker, the camera is better than other when you compare this prices with others, definitly I like it.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Mid range phone", "Author": "John K.", "ReviewID": "R238DG722RP3VL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Styling and size is very good.
