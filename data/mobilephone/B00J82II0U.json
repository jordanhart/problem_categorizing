As soon as I turned it on it said DEMON in bright red letters, it's runs terribly slow and I'm just not satisfied with it at all. I thought at first it was the samsung galaxy s4 because it looks EXACTLY like it, but it's just a shitty knock off. This phone is terrible. It took a good 10 seconds to show the word I typed out, need two SIM cards to run it & the battery is shit. I will never buy something off the internet ever again. If I cannot buy it in an actual store, I will not buy it.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "okay", "Author": "ThatNewOrleansBoy", "ReviewID": "R394HKMM8Z6D2Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone had demon on it as soon as u turn it on and runs really slow but overall its an okay phon p.s it needs two sim cards", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00J82II0U"}}
