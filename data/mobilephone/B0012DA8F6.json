{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's a sub-$30 phone, so what do you expect?", "Author": "Jon M Altbergs", "ReviewID": "R3OHJDOAD60G38", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first foray into pre-paid telephone plans in the US. After using my mobile phone as my only phone for the past few years, I found that my new house has absolutely no signal coverage. So it was time to abandon the monthly plan for something less expensive and Virgin Mobile seemed to have the best deals available in my area. I grabbed a Flare and a $90 topup card and was ready to go.On-line activation was a snap (and offers some bonuses that aren't available if you call the service center to activate) and my phone was on the network within 2 hours of activation. The $90 topup card provided a year's worth of service (meaning I'll never have to top up again in the next 12 months to keep my phone active) as well as approximately 1500 minutes when all bonuses were applied.  All things considered, it wasn't a bad deal--I was paying more than $40 a month for 300 anytime minutes and free nights and weekends on my old phone. (Virgin does offer a similar plan with daily and monthly fees if you want to go that way--I didn't since my usage pattern is definitely going to change now.)As for the phone itself, well, it makes phone calls.  I don't download much stuff on my phone--the occasional ringtone and wallpaper--and I don't surf or text much either (even when I had unlimited surfing and texting) so my chief concern is how well a phone works as a phone and how easy it is to get my phone directory into it. I have to say I was very pleased on both counts.  Calls sound fine and signal strength is good.  The volume is easy to adjust and the phone is quite loud when turned all the way up (I hate phones that are too quiet).My only quibble is with the keypad.  The keys are rectangular, but the buttons under them are round, which creates deadspots on the keys, so as I type I have to feel for the little bump to make sure my button press will register. (I have large fingers and use the edge of the tip of my thumb ... the keypad might work well for smaller hands.) However, the bright screen and color contrast make it very easy to read what I'm typing, which in my book overcomes the weaknesses in the keypad.This isn't the best mobile phone I've ever owned, but it's a sub-$30 phone and to compare it to a phone costing 10X as much would be unfair. On a per-dollar basis, I am very pleased with the LG Flare.Pros--Inexpensive to buy (and replace, if necessary)External LCD screenScreens are bright and easy-to-readOne-touch account balance, call log, messaging, set up, and vibrate/silent modeVoice-activated dialing and volume control on outer edgeBluetooth compatibleVirgin Mobile plans allow a meager $60 upfront topup to activate for an entire year (the $90 card I purchased is not necessary)Customizable ringtones can be set for each person in directoryMultiple phone numbers per person in directoryIntuitive menu systemCons--Cheap feel to housing and keypadNot much variety in pre-loaded ringtonesMediocre stand-by battery life", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Joseph P.

Gross Georg \"imgeorg\"", "ReviewID": "R2RKUYV1Y44SPW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, I was so anxious for a bluetooth phone, I bought the Flare. I couldn't beat the price for something with that technology, and the only reason I want bluetooth is for to use wireless headsets at last! For this I deactivate my perfectly good MTV Edition V5 Slider, and after an afternoon of entering my address book on a new phone, I already miss having a Kyocera.Right now, Life's not so Good. Before, with my V5, all I had to do was push the up button for my balance, and the right button to set the phone to vibrate, along with the usual on/off buttons. With the LG Flare, I have to push a menu button, find the \"my account\" button, wait for it to launch a browser, which is scary because I have no intention of paying for web content. Then, once the balance shows, without warning like my Kyocera did, you hit the red phone to get out of it, and the web browser icon remains on the phone. I hate that! You go through just about the same rigmarole to set the phone to vibrate. The owner's manual doesn't even mention vibrate in the index, so I'm better off downloading the PDF from Virgin Mobile's website so that I can keyword search the document! I've managed to turn down the funky ringtone volume (I miss my Kyocera ringtones, too - I don't want rap music on my phone!) Entering text is a headache no matter what phone you have, so re-entering my contact list is once again a chore. I learned my lesson from my first VM phone, though, and I only put the important people in! It's a lot to get used to, and a downside to phones with no SIM card. But I don't need complicated phones! I need 'em to make and take calls, and that's it.So why did I buy it in the first place? As mentioned before, the opportunity for a wireless headset which my beloved Kyoceras don't have. Also, the phone is a handsome little thing! It's about the same size as my slider when closed, but it not as thick. When the clamshell is opened, it gives the impression of being a much bigger phone, which I like. I've set the backlighting to dim, but when an incoming call comes in, a window lights up on the outside of the clamshell where the time is.One thing I did notice is the time it takes to get going when it's been turned on. It says \"HELLO\" in big letters, almost like my JVC XV-N40BK Progressive-Scan Slim DVD Player (Black) did, and when you turn it off, it says \"BYE\" in big letters that show up on both the inside and the outside screen. It's gimmicky stuff that I think is actually kind of neat.After two days I don't yet know if I'll keep it - almost as soon as I bought this I heard of a new slider phone coming for Virgin Mobile made by Samsung! Maybe one day Kyocera will make a bluetooth slider for Virgin Mobile - BESIDES the Slider Sonic - that doesn't cost too much that I can love. I'll never pay $100 for a phone, whether it's landline or wireless. I loved my cheap little slider - and sliders in general. But, after three phones with Virgin Mobile, first the sturdy K9 Royale, then my trusty V5 slider, this is my first non-Kyocera phone I've had in the four years I've been with Virgin Mobile. Maybe I'll learn to like it more as I live with it. I'm willing to give it a chance in the meantime. I've heard good things about LG, so we'll see.  One thing about Virgin Mobile phones - if I don't like it, it won't cost me a two-year contract or an arm and a leg to change it!", "Date": "May 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "LG Flare is a good choice for a Virgin Mobile phone", "Author": "K. Newland", "ReviewID": "R5FXUXEC5QBQB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I originally purchased Virgin Mobile's $20 phone, the Kyocera TNT.  Although the phone was cute, the screen resolution was VERY poor and the sound quality was tinny.  In order to hear your phone messages through the speaker phone, you had to turn the phone backwards because the outbound sound was emitted from a speaker faced to the outside of the phone.Sound quality is much improved with this LG Flare. For only $10 more, this phone has a M4 audio quality which is the highest that you can get. The screen is also clearer and brighter.  After a week of use, there are only two things that I would change:  skip the little door that covers the port for the battery recharger and update the look of the exterior to mimic the TNT (snazzy color, rubberized exterior, etc.)", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "horrible phone, low battery life, bad GUI", "Author": "J. Palmisano", "ReviewID": "RHNT6SRQKBTBV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First I'll mention the pluses with this phone. First its very cheap. It has a very strong body, stronger than even my Nokia. The vibrator on it is also fairly strong (most phones have a weak vibrator that I rarely feel).Now for the bad stuff . . .1) It has port covers that look very fragile (for battery, etc). None have broken after 2 months use, but I've been very careful.2) The battery drains *very* fast when you have low or no signal. For example, despite not using the phone, spending 8 hours at work in a no-signal basement literally drains 50% of the battery. The phone feels very warm to the touch whenever in low/no signal areas. A fully charged battery will die in under 24 hours if your phone is in a no-signal area (ie go camping, spend time in subway, basement, etc.) I keep my phone off 50% of the time for fear I'll be stuck with a dead battery (happens all the time with this phone). I have to charge this phone almost daily, where on my 4 year old cheap motorola phone I haven't once replaced the battery, and it still holds a weeks worth of charge!3) The 'airplane mode' is very useful. I use it to turn off my phone to prevent the battery from dieing in low/no signal areas.4) The top LCD that displays time is horrible. I can't see it outside even on a cloudy day, and it doesn't update the time unless your phone has a signal. It also displays the last time you checked it for about 1 second before displaying the current time (requires a button push).5) The GUI is absolutely horrible. It takes 3x more button clicks to get anything done compared to all my other cheap phones I've owned. No customizable hotkeys.5) My four year old ultra cheap Motorola cell phone can run Java 10x faster. The Flare takes minutes to load up a simple Opera browser.6) You have to read the same message twice for it to stop telling you that you have new messages.7) Internet sucks on it. Virgin had me go through this 3 phone call multiple day process trying to get it to work, and finally they said 'its a known problem and engineers are working on it, call back in 72 hours'. Well, I've called them once every 4 days for an entire month, and they kept saying the same thing. Two months have passed, still no internet. On very rare occasions, say 5% of the time I try, I can get a connection. But its *very* slow. Way slower than on my 4 year old cheap motorola phone.8) No SIM card. Doesn't work with any phone backup software I've tried.Garbage.

I've been using their service for years and have had at least a half-dozen of their phones. Overall I was happy with their service, but when I bought this phone almost two years ago my opinion of them started going down. Other than the battery issues that others have mentioned here, it worked OK for the first few months. Then I started getting text messages that were days old, or not getting them at all. I contacted VM support through the web site and they responded within 24 hours, but they wanted me to document when messages were sent and when I received them. I didn't have time to deal with it at the time and just decided to do without texting for a while. When I wanted to try fixing it again, they promptly said that this is a known problem with the phone and that they would send me another one. I got it within a couple of days, got it set up and it worked fine (other than the weak battery still.) However, after a few months I started having the texting problem again. When I contacted them they responded promptly again, and this time offered to send me a different phone. Without thinking I said OK, but then I did a little research on the phone they were going to send me (the TNT) and found that it didn't have bluetooth, one of the features that I bought the Flare for. I emailed them again and said, wait, I want a phone with the same features as the one they're replacing. They pretty much said that i have the choices of keeping the Flare without texting if I want bluetooth, take the TNT and have texting but no bluetooth, or buy a new phone. It also occurred to me that when I bought the Flare it was a $40 phone, the TNT was $20 most of the time that they sold it, if not from day 1. I think it's pretty cheezey of them to give me an older, cheaper phone with less features than the one that they're replacing. If they were more customer-service oriented, they would have offered me a better phone when I pointed out the lack of features in the replacement phone, even if it was a little more expensive when new.

I was expecting better scores.  I think it's a decent phone, just lacking some modern features.  There's no MP3 player, no camera (most cell phone cameras are pretty bad anyway), and there's no speakerphone (though it's a bluetooth phone, so I wouldn't use that anyway, I don't get it).  Voice quality over the phone is very good, about on the same level as my old Kyocera K9, which I'm told is one of the best sounding phones.  Ringtones are loud enough that I can actually hear them.It is a decent-looking phone, although a bit boring for some, I guess.  It has held up well, and is still 100% functional even after being dropped a few times, and having been bumped into things all the time.Service?I've kept my Virgin Mobile service for a few years now.  I don't use my phone all that much, so the $15/90 days I believe is still the cheapest available, and it works great for me.  I do lose reception in steel buildings, but they all do that.  I've never had a dropped call, or missed a call due to not having a signal.I wish the phone had more notepad memory.  After you have 10 or 15 notes, it won't let you create any more, even if there's lots of memory left on the phone.  I don't like any of the ringtones or text-tones that come loaded in the phone, and the games loaded on the phone are only trial versions.  So it cost me $13, I think, to download a ringtone I like, and add a couple games to keep me occupied if get stuck waiting.I was actually shopping to replace the Flare, but it sounds like the X-TC is too limited, and the other phones are mostly the same, except that some have cameras.  I'll just stick with what I have for a while longer.UPDATE, 7/22/12:  I'm not sure what's going on, but the phone started to drain the battery within 16 hours about a month ago.

Hendricks \"Space Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "R3QW5GULFVS8OL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a previous LG phone from Virgin Wireless - the Aloha, and it turned out the LG Flare has EXACTLY the same SW as my previous phone.  This is not a bad thing, really.  I just wanted a cheap digits-only phone that wouldn't change numbers every time I moved jobs, and that my family could just remember and forget.  After about 5 years, the Aloha was starting to fall apart, so I found the Flare.  The SW overall is OK, with only one real quirk that irritated me.  When you went into Vibrate mode for a movie theater, the volume was reset to middle instead of your original setting when you leave Vibrate mode.  It's strange that this same issue on the Aloha was also present on the Flare.This phone does have an external display, which I didn't really see any value in.  The contents of the display aren't visible unless you press a button on the side of the phone to light it up, and then it takes a second to update the value after it turns on the backlight.The one HW change that I really hated was the new charging scheme.  The Aloha had a \"butt plug\" (seriously, that's the real way cellphone manufacturers call it!), which was easy to find and insert correctly, even in the dark or while not paying attention.  The Flare on the other hand, has a charger port on the side of the phone, and uses a smaller charger socket that is difficult to attach correctly, and unique to the Flare.  The port also has a cover that needs to be opened every time you charge.They did add external volume buttons, along with a voice dial button.  The volume on the phone wasn't very loud in either model, but it was good enough to use.  Never tried the voice dialing, so I can't comment on that.The one big negative I have is that the voice quality has gone way down.  My family has repeatedly complained that there is loud scratching or static on the line when I talk with the phone.  I don't know if this is just due to my phone or a general issue.3/5 stars without voice issue1/5 stars with voice issue", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "VERY BAD BATTERY!", "Author": "D.

After all, I figured, 'It's an LG'.  Little did I know, months later, that I would run into all sorts of problems like not being able to dial overseas and constantly running out of minutes (which always felt more than $0.20 a minute).  These turned out to be my pet peeves because I bought the phone for those main uses but when they didn't work out as planned, I kept thinking that I should have kept my regular Sprint phone plan, rather than to buy this nearly useless phone.  I found that since Sep., when I first bought the phone, I've \"topped up\" or filled up my prepaid phone minutes ($20 for 200 minutes, $30 for 400 minutes, $50 for 1,000 minutes) more than I wanted to or even expected to- 5 or 6 times, rather than just 3 or 4 times.Don't get me wrong.  The phone's got some good features like easy text messaging, some limited internet access, and up to 3.5 hours of talk time which would temp any new buyer.  Unfortunately, the phone does not use cell phone minutes wisely.  It eats them away like those cheap, overrated calling cards.  If you're a big talker who likes to keep in touch with friends all the time, your best bet is to get a monthly plan, maybe with a company other than Virgin Mobile.  Buy this phone only if you're more of a clam and use the phone rarely like asking about the occasional bill or calling 911 for something.  Maybe then, you can make those cell phone minutes worth every overrated penny of what they're worth.  In fact, if I know then what I know now, I think I would've strictly gotten a phone card.
