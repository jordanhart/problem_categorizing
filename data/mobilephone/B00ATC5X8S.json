Depending on what company u hook it up with.  It is a standard sim.  U can buy the sim card here.  U need a micro sd card too download apps.  Buy the larger one if u download alot or record alot. Not the 2 or the 4 not enough memory. There is a really good video camera on it with both back and front faceing cameras. The apn setting does have too be set on ur phone.  But whoever provider u call too activate ur phone tells u how too do it. If u cant understand them or they dont understand u because most of them r from freakin India, they can email u the instructions. It must be a job qualification that all telemarketers have to be from India. Lol the phone is great. It works great and it has a 5\" screen. I love it. No wonder it keeps selling out at that price. And download battery saver in ur playstore. It helps.
