Missing the manual, sim tool opener and headphones.  Contacted Amazon, and the gave me a partial credit.  I was happy with that.  I called AT&T; and got the phone unlocked with no problems.  I prefer to use a pay as you go service with AT&T; as it is approx half the price of a contract.  Though they will tell you that prepaid does not work with iphones.  All you have to do is when you activate your sim online, where it asks for the IMEI number, just put all zero's. Worked like a charm...just a tidbit for those of you wondering if you can use an iphone as prepaid.  You can, they just don't want you to.  And this phone is perfect for just that.

They create quickly evolving planned-obsolescence-based products on a locked proprietary technology. Case in point, iphone 3GS released in 2008, now many years old and still being shipped as a \"new\" product at amazon five years later. If all you want to do is make phone calls, ok. But most people pay the hundreds of extra dollars for the icing on the cake, all those fancy apps available only at the Apple store and installable only with the free itunes program.Well, I just happen to have one of them and it is next to useless compared to a current model device because three-quarters of the apps for it give an error message saying that the app is incompatible with my IOS. How did this happen? When new models come out they have a new IOS and developers write code for the new IOS, not the old one when they fix bugs and plan a new release. Well, so what, I already have the app I want and it works fine, right?Way too often the answer is Wrong, How does this happen? Your computer has to be \"authorized\" and if anything happens to the authorized computer in the meantime, like you get a new one or whatever, you can't make changes to the iphone anymore unless you authorize the new one thereby wiping the iphone clean of its working apps. So you bite the bullet and download a fresh copy of your growing list of favorite apps. Getting the idea--most of them are not the same any more, they are newer, \"improved\" versions that don't work on your IOS anymore. That wouldn't be so bad if Apple was willing to supply archive copies of the versions you need, but they don't. Even if your IOS is \"up-to-date\" because the definition of up-to-date depends on your model and you have a five-year-old legacy model now even if you bought it yesterday.How do I know, I just went through this scenario and of the apps I downloaded and expected to work, over fifty of them were not backwards compatible.I am not talking about games or \"fun\" apps, I am talking hard core business essential apps, anything from Google, Adobe, Microsoft, IBM, etc that I tried failed, not even access to PayPal. Can you live without Skype, Line2, PayPal, iBooks, Kindle, Nook, Adobe Reader, Audiobooks, Evernote, SameTime, RedLaser, the White Pages, ebay, amazon, wikipanion, Merriam Websters, OneNote, Yelp, Urbanspoon, VPN, LogMeIn, Google Chrome, Earth, Maps, Search, and GoogleVoice; DropBox, Palringo, fring, imDB, OpusDomini, Apzilla or MyEyesOnly, in short, almost any blue-chip five-star app worth having. Don't buy a \"new\" iphone 3GS if you need any of these, because none of them will work with the most current IOS for that model.Apple's business model may be good for Apple, but is planned obsolescence best for you?Unless you are in the unique position of being an Apple developer with insider knowledge and special tools, you will inevitably notice an obsolescence creep with handheld Touch gizmos from Apple unless they undergo a drastic change of policy.

Thankfully it was only 99 cent, because it is worth nothing more than that. I was excited to get the iPhone because I thought that they were better than androids, but I was wrong. This phone is EXTREMELY slow, it lags constantly, and the battery life sucks. I have to carry the charger around with me at all times, and charge it at least 3 times a day. The t9 feature is horrible, which is why I turned it off. Half of the apps wont even load most the time. If my screen is locked and I get a text I have to lock the screen back and press the home button before I can even slide to unlock the phone. The touch screen isn't as responsive as it used to be, I have to tap something 10 times before it opens. I hate that this thing doesn't have a back button, it only has a home button, which can be quite inconvenient at times when you're in a hurry and have to go all the way back to the home screen just to get back to where you were. The camera is of low quality and can be quite dark. The colors on this thing are not bright and vibrant, they are very dull. I also don't like the fact that the screen isn't customizable. This phone isn't very durable at all, if you drop it, it WILL break. Yes the Otterboxes do help but who wants to carry around a bulky phone?

I got this exact model from my phone plan carrier new right out of the box from Apple.  This phone is not well designed in terms of how easy it is to damage it.  If you drop or it hit it (i dropped mine 2ft onto gravel, it landed on it's side) the screen will spider crack.  My Iphone spider cracked all the way from the left bottom corner to the top right corner cracking over 50% of the screen.  For Apple's price tags this is unacceptable for such a short drop, but again poor design.  The backside of the phone near the charger port is cracking apart to, it already has a growing 1\" crack going up the back of the Iphone.  Keep in mind this is after only 1 short drop and having the phone for only a year thus far.  The IOS is a joke compared to the far superior Android or Windows 7.5(8).  As for apps Apple has 200,000....about 50,000 of them are actually useful or wrok.  The included IOS apps camera, photo, youtube, and safari crash daily on a regular basis and sometimes freeze up to a black screen until your battery dies as reset stops working when this happens.  The youtube app is total garbage and cripples youtube use in an already stale flashless ecosystem.  The youtube app filters your search so you can never find what video/song your looking for even if you type it in letter for letter while watching the video in question off youtube.com on a real computer.  The only search rusults you will see are cover versions of the songs etc your looking by annoying people feeling the need to video tape themselves.  Maybe Apple made the youtube app such garbage so users would be forced to pay to listen from itunes, it certainly sounds like something they would do and have done.  Having no flash support is just braindead, and without jailbreak you can't do anything to fix it and if you jailbreak this locked down piece of junk you can't update it or sign into itunes.  The camera is good when the camera app stops crashing long enough to use it, the speaker is decent if you can find any non-flash videos after deleting the useless youtube app and going to youtube through safari which makes it slow but at least it shows you actual search results....even if you cannot watch 85% of them due to crapple not having flash.  This phone drops signal regularly and stays there until you reset the phone, if you walk under pretty much anything your signal is gone or it fades and dies by itself.  The signal reception on this device sucks, simply put.  The touch features work most of the time but suck for web browsing, games or typing.  Get some of your friends to send you back some of the texts you send on this, they will surly think you drunk.  The battery life is terrible, it will last a long time if you don't use it but constantly losing signals and searching for them until you reset the phone drains it, video or music drains it super quick, safari use drains it quick and if you can get a signal for more than 20mins calling/recieving calls drains it.  In a nutshell, not good battery life for the price.  With all Apple products these days you cannot change the batteries or buy back up batteries which is blatently wrong and just plain screwing the user forcing them to take it to the Apple store.  The headphone jack sucks because even with no headphones attatched to it, it locks itself into headphone mode for no reason.  Getting out of headphone mode has to be done physically as there is no setting for this to be toggled in this stale IOS.  Until you get the phone out of headphone mode, you cannot hear anything (music,ringers,calls,video) from the Iphone.  Lastly this Iphone gets extremely hot at times for no reason, but it's not a suprize as other phones/pda's have ventilation, the Iphone does not.  Apple would rather have it thin that function properly it seems.  As my review of this implies I am very unhappy with the Iphone and have ditched it for the far superior Nokia Windows phone.  I would not recommend an Iphone to anyone and once Surface comes out the Ipad (giant iphone) will be obsolete anyway.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "damage", "Author": "JANI", "ReviewID": "R2DLJEHZOZK3TE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the was totally locked, nobody can unlocked in Venezuela and damage batery, i spend a lot money traying unlocked and nothing, I always bought phones in amazon to take it to Venezuela and this is the first time i had problem", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Now I get it", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R1LUVVPVZZ1XIQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I always knew that the iphone was a phone with a great looking screen but poor OS, but I wanted to give it a try. Also, most \"important\" apps were being developed for it first than android. My broker Zecco for example.I got to say that the iphone is 60% fanboy hype and 40% technology. After having used android for over a year and then buying this iphone it was like driving a BMW and then buying a Camry. The differences were hard to ignore. I can only do about half what I could do with my android even a lower end device. Even counting the exclusive iphone apps it doesn't justify the downgrade.I have to admit though that the iphone screen is still better looking under sunlight and the glass screen feels right on the fingers.Edit: I just noticed that people are not upvoting my review which leads me to say that they didn't want to hear my honest opinion. Well sorry I didn't over hype this pretty but mediocre phone. If you want to hear a biased opinion well ask a fanboy.  He'll tell you it's the most amazing piece of engineering ever.  But it isn't.
