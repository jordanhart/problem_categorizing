I wanted something basic and simple, as I don't text, I don't access the Internet on my phone and I don't Facebook or Tweet. The Nokia 111 fulfills my needs very nicely. It's compact and light and has a decent screen. Working through the menus is easy. Locking and unlocking the keypad is simple. I recommend it to anyone wanting a good, basic, simple phone.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't use with ATT anymore", "Author": "xin hu", "ReviewID": "R6WEG1NYG250J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had to return it because ATT said this phone is 2G, and their network no longer support this type of devices.The phone feels ok in hand.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "Vasileios Pananidis", "ReviewID": "R16P4LR33O1YV4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Best value for money.
