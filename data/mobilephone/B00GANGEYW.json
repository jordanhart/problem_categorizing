Did they have to put such a cheap speaker in the phone?  When the phone speaks, as when it pronounces the name of people in your contact list , it's hard to understand what it's saying. The speakers also affect the quality of the ringtones.I like the feature where you can press a button and give it a command:  \"Call Gary\".  It understands this, as long as your names aren't too close in how they sound.  Initially, I had put the first and last name of each contact, but when I had it this way, it just could not understand when I told it to call, \"Gary Smith\".  By eliminating the last name in the contact list, it could understand \"Call Gary\".  Quite a pain.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pantech Breeze", "Author": "firk", "ReviewID": "R1C5SF4FPM3WSH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 2nd generation of Pantech that I have purchased.

PC SUITE WILL NOT WORK w/ WIN 7 64bit USB!!!!", "Author": "Bigman \"Postal 2\"", "ReviewID": "R38PEFL64EJIXJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great phone but!!!!!!!!!!!After reading all the reviews on the web about this phone I figure that it would be just the ticket to have the Email access I needed w/o having to get a Smart Phone. ;-)So I get online w/ AT&T; and chat with the sales folks. I explain that this sounds like the phone that I want after all the research I have done. I go on to explain that I would need is just to access my email time to time and I'm told that there unlimited text/talk plan w/300 mb of data would be more they enough for myself  and that I could access my email using their Mobile Email.So I order the phone and I figure that it's a no brainier and I'm ready to go. NOT SO FAST AT&T; PANTECH!So charge the phone up and try to access MOBILE EMAIL and I get:YOUR PHONE NO LONGER SUPPORTS THIS EMAIL APPLICATION. YOUR ACCOUNTS ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE ANYMORE (12)Well I just figure that the phone is new and I'm doing something wrong and I call AT&T; Support and I'm told that it should work and on the phone an hour or so trying to get it to work. Finally I explain that I have to go to work and I will call back.  Next time I try AT&T; support chat and again on w/ them for well over trying to get it to work (I tried Yahoo as well as my Gmail addresses and got the same message.)My calls to AT&T; and chat went on for 4 days w/ out any explanation why I could not access my email on this phone and why I kept getting the same error message. At one point a tech mentioned that for $5 dollars extra per month I may be able to get it. I then called AT&T; back yet again and was told no that it was already included in my plan period.So day 4 back on the phone yet again and this time the tech said she would get to the bottom of why I could not access the web mail. She put through to the next level tech and he told me not worry he would get me fixed up.Well after a hour on the phone w/ the tech he said enough is enough and would I mind if he called Pantech. I replied please, please, it's about time. So he calls Pantech and explains the error message and asks what the fix is? Pantech's reply is very simple.IT'S DISCONTINUED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So at this point the AT&T; tech gives me the same o same o as the rest. AT&T; is sorry for the mix-up. I explain that this phone was sold to me through AT&T; and that I was told that this was part of the plan and that the 300-MB per mo would be more than enough for what I needed.Again get the so sorry and am told perhaps you should pick out a smart phone and just have the apps turned off so you get voice/text and email. So at this point I say OK will start looking.While this is going on my return time is counting down in which I can return the phone. So I choose one of the Galaxy Smart phone's after reading a lot of reviews and asking questions to AT&T; sales. So I call to order the phone and while going through all the paperwork I'm now told \"you know that having a smart phone will run you a extra $20 per mo\"!!!!!!!!!ALSO AT THIS POINT IT WAS ALSO EXPLAINED TO MYSELF WHAT EVER PHONE YOU HAVE THAT YOUR TEXT (photos /video) DOES USE PART OF THE 300-mb data??? Unlimited - Text /talk??? WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?? My T-Moble never had that??Again I explain what had happened w/ my Pantect IV BREEZE and how I was told that I could use their WEB Mail. That of course falls on deaf ears. I kindly ask if there is any way I could get in touch w/ the upper level tech that told me to look at a Smart Phone.  I'm told possibly, but by the time they could find the person my exchange time would of run out .So it looks like I have a Pantech IV BREEZE.....Now on to Pantech support, it's not good perhaps a hair over bad period.  I called them explaining that I could not install there PC SUITE on my WIN 7 64 Bit system. I'm told no problem ,here install this (there PC suite) which I had already installed.  I explained again with not work w/ USB.The tech goes oh yeah we have work around. Go to C: >Program Files> Pantech > PSMN_Install_V4_12_9_0> and install this. Said I already did that and it still will not connect via USB. At that point Pantech tech has the ultimate fix! He hangs up!!!!!!!!So end up going on Amazon and getting a USB Bluetooth adapter so I can at least access my phone though my PC to get my photos etc. Bluetooth does work but it's not as fast as USB (and again more money spent) on something that should of worked in the first place.As a longtime customer of AT&T; well over 40 years I think that there going the well of Dell and many of the larger companies that really put customer service last, it's just getting you sign up with them as a provider. Like one of the support people told me why not go to a AT&T; store to buy.  My reply was I'm a anal buyer and want to read reviews and ask questions prior to making a decision, I'm not a kid (60y/o) and am not in a hurry for what I want.Phone would have been fantastic if the features that were told to me that were on it actually worked as it was touted! What is the use if you open the phone up to WEB MAIL only to find an error message which ultimately turns out to be that this function is discontented!I guess that this phone is being directed at the age group that is more interested in BIG BUTTONS and just dialing a phone numbers are a thrill. Had to add a little levity here ;-)Last but not least on the minimum of complaints on the BREEZE IV (2050) the back light on the buttons is noticeably dimmer then other phones. I did call Pantech to ask if there was an adjustment and was told yes , let me look it up and then the tech told me said no.....Bottom great simple phone, but if you going simple might was well get the BREEZE III .Thanks all for reading, just a heads up.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "love the phone", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R24FTL9XCKOQQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "love the phone would recommend it to anybody love the phone but not the battery life sucks:( but overall the product is great", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very impressed!", "Author": "MdniteEagl", "ReviewID": "REBXLK5583ZPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My contract was up and it was time for a new phone.  I don't want or need a smartphone and I already had the Samsung Rugby III.  For basic flip phones, I was pretty much limited to the Pantech Breeze IV and the LG A380.  Having had the LG A340 prior, I wasn't crazy about the A380 since it was basically the same phone with some minor updates.  On the other hand, we bought my dad a Breeze III 4 years ago and it has survived without a hitch with him, so I was confident the Breeze IV would handle what I could dish out.  And I was very intrigued by the new 3-inch 240x400 screen.AT&T; is doing free overnight delivery and FedEx brought it on time.  Charged it and prepared to swap over from the Rugby III.  The MicroSD card was no problem, but I discovered I would need to do a full activation since the Breeze used a newer and physically smaller SIM.  This is where the AT&T; Address Book *really* comes in handy, as all my contacts were there and I wouldn't lose them from the older SIM.  Once the SIM was activated, I was able to easily download all the contacts and all was ready to go.  Made a test phone call and text message, no problem.  The upgraded camera is a nice improvement - it has auto focus and LED flash, much better white balance, it even shoots in 240x400 resolution for things you'd like to use as wallpaper.While not available here at Amazon, AT&T; offers a CaseMate rugged shell/cover specifically for the Breeze IV, and that was the only accessory I added.  Once installed, it gives the phone a similar high-durability shell like the Samsung Rugby line - polycarbonate exterior with silicone-gel shock absorption means your phone will survive a typical drop or fall from a desk or table with no problem.  The case also makes the phone a bit wider and slightly longer, for a good \"man-size\" feel.  And the tension in the hinge is such that you don't have to open it all the way for a phone call if that will be too long - it will stay at pretty much any intermediate angle/position.I know the battery life can be iffy (which is why I have it at 4 stars instead of 5), but with the addition of the rugged CaseMate shell, I've effectively created a \"better\" Samsung Rugby that's easier to use and has a bit less bloatware.  Very pleased so far, and look forward to good service from the Breeze IV.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great sound - terrible battery life", "Author": "Daryl Hoffman \"Daryl\"", "ReviewID": "R2MX4C0N6JLK3B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone has the best ever sound quality.
