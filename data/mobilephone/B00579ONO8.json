First and foremost of course, to make and receive phone calls, and second to be used for infrequent text messaging.It started OK for like four days, then suddenly there started to be some kind of humming noise in the background that interfered with all calls made and received. We asked the callers if they heard the background noise but none of them did.  Considering it was a brand new phone and having failed in such a short period of time, I decided it was best to return it. Otherwise, it was a nice form factor and it weighed very little.

Came with charger, battery, instruction book.  As per the instructions  I removed the back cover to inspect the SIMS slot,  tried to close the cover and the cover wouldn't align and \"click\" closed as instructed.  The end of the phone, the cover was \"ajar\".  Removed the cover again and carefully inspected the alignment points, the little \"prongs\" that should click in place just weren't catching the respective holes in the body of the phone.  After trying several times,  I concluded that this cover wasn't going to close and remain ajar which is unacceptable for practical use.  I would have to \"tape it down\" somehow and this wasn't going to be a good long-term fix.  I was very disappointed as I was confident that something made by SAMSUNG would be of a higher quality manufacture.  The cover is plastic and quite thin,  and I would be concerned that I'd break it  or it would come apart while traveling.
