{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Was Good Entry Level Phone - Now Replaced by Galaxy Rush", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R198WNCJGQYLHQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "NOTE: The Prevail has been replaced by the Boost Mobile Galaxy Rush, which has FOUR TIMES more internal memory for your apps than the Prevail.  The Rush lists for $150, so the only reason to buy a Prevail is if you find one at an VERY, VERY low price.The majority of Prevail owners are happy with their new phone for a few weeks, but after downloading a bunch of new apps and updates for their old apps, find that their Prevail freezes up.  The Prevail's Task Manager shows it only has 161 mb of internal memory.  The phone needs at least 40 mb of free memory for cache memory.  So, select a few essential apps so that you do NOT use more than 120 mb of internal memory for apps.  If you do so, your Prevail will always run as smoothly as it did on \"Day One\".You can restore your phone to its \"Day One\" speed and smoothness by formatting your memory card and then doing a \"factory restore\", as explained in the owner's manual.  This process takes ten minutes.  It erases all your photos, music, text messages, email, old apps, and anything else clogging up your Prevail's memory.  After the restore, reinstall ONLY the apps that you use every day, and be careful to use no more than 120 mb of internal memory.  Go to Google Play Store and UNcheck the box for \"automatic updates\" and do NOT do any manual updates...updates waste memory.  The Prevail works best with the original factory versions of key apps.Boost uses the Sprint Network, which is limited to America's fifty biggest cities, and interstate highways connecting those cities.  If you live on a farm in West Texas, or in a village in North Dakota, none of the Sprint companies are a good choice.  The staff at the Radio Shack closest to your home are good sources of information about whether the Sprint Network is reliable in your community.As with all Android phones, you need to learn how to control battery life by turning OFF Wi-Fi, 3G, and Bluetooth when you are not using them.  The Prevail comes with a power widget to toogle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on and off and you can get use the free \"Data Switch\" app to toogle 3G on and off.Use the \"Downloads\" folder in \"Manage Apps\" to delete every app you are not using daily.  Do NOT delete \"Google Play Store\", as it is required for your phone to work properly.  UNinstall updates for every app you decide to keep except for \"Google Play Store\" and Pandora Radio.  Google Maps Updates are a huge waste of memory.Next, move your apps over to the SD card.  Google Apps can not be moved, so simply uninstall their updates.  Go to \"Google Play Store\" and open your list of apps.  UNcheck the box for \"automatic updates\".  Ignore all messages you get asking you to update apps.  The updates for any Google App, such as Google Maps, are unneccessary and waste memory.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast shipping awesome deal", "Author": "Annie", "ReviewID": "R3518K2QH9FB68", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best deal i came across for the price you cant beat it especially with the added case and car charger I ordered it and it came 3 days later I am a VERY HAPPY customer:)Since some of you people have doubts this phone is BRAND NEW IN ITS ORIGINAL PACKAGE I was skeptical AT first and emailed the seller and THEY did confirm it was all new since it did not say anything about being new...", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "First Timer", "Author": "Morris \"Likes to Review\"", "ReviewID": "R2WKWJWW9C1AQJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased 2 of these for my Sister and her Husband.

The Samsung Galaxy Prevail, however, should not be sold on the market. It's that bad. The cell was advertised as Android 2.2, but little did I know that flash does not work on it. That's right, they purposely disabled flash (one of the biggest advantages of owning an Android over an iPhone).The phone itself is extremely buggy, and is constantly crashing resulting in a reset of the phone or just a power-off (which is extremely unfortunate when I'm waiting for people to call me and I don't realize my phone has shut itself off).The phone has very little internal memory, but, considering how little it has, it makes it impossible to use this phone as a smart phone. If you purchase this phone, you will not be able to download more than one or two apps. Period. I used the expansion slot to add 16 Gb of space, but it did me almost no good as most apps need to run off the phone. Apps that would be able to run off the memory stick I cannot download either, as the phone itself does not have enough space to allow download and transfer to the memory stick.Also, the phone is now experiencing a kind of drive failure that has disabled me from downloading or updating any apps on the phone. I am going to have to buy a new phone at this point.To summarize, if you are looking for a good smart phone then stay away from the Samsung Galaxy Prevail. If you just need something to work as a phone and don't really care about the smart phone features then stay away from the Samsung Galaxy Prevail. This phone makes Samsung look very bad.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy Prevail", "Author": "Jerome Stein \"JES\"", "ReviewID": "R1E7UP5HN7VP1M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my son and he seems very pleased with it.

I only had unlimited texting and limited talk. This phone gave me a lot of trouble with getting onto Wifi networks and its keyboard was tempermental. There were moments where I'd have to open up the phone to clean out gravel and insert cotton balls so the optical touch interface would register. This phone put me through a lot but it held together. But still this was 2009 tech.  You don't realize how much new stuff you've missed out on till you get something like an Android. This was the frame of mind I was in when I went to buy this phone:I read the reviews I knew I wasn't getting a powerhouse. The phone's touch screen is responsive and I love that it vibrates when I click the keyboard. My fingers are normal sized and I thought I couldn't text well but then I realized I was using the \"swype\" keyboard and not the android keyboard with stuff like autocorrect.  The interface on this phone is easy to learn and it's intuitive, you won't feel out-classed by the phone. It's very manageable. Give yourself a good hour of playing around with it you'll get it.The call quality is perfect.The one thing I didn't like about the phone is its small screen size. I guess it could be a unforeseen outcome,this phone has been such a good introduction to Android phones that I'm already reading up on upgrading to a phone with a bigger screen and maybe a faster processor.  For anyone uncertain about Androids switching over from dumb-phones this phone will be an awesome introduction to the line of phones. It will help you realize if they really are for you or not.For a future college student I wanted a phone that I could download apps with and stay connected, with a plan I could personally handle. I love the Shrinkage plan as it not only encourages me to pay my bills on time but the Boostmobile plan is contract-free. So if I ever decide that I want to go to another network I will do so with relative ease.People complain about battery life. Please be nice to your phone as I said earlier, it's no powerhouse. Cut battery usage where you can whether it be through backlight or not having your Wifi receiver on all the time.I don't regret buying this phone at all it's design is easy on the eyes and it has a sleek finish.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Thank You Boost Mobile and Amazon", "Author": "John Mark \"Host of BookMinistry\"", "ReviewID": "R1IKS4DX14CUBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to thank Boost Mobile and Amazon for making this smart-phone available.

I had to root the phone to make it usable because Boost bloats with apps that you can't get rid of.

I want a new phone badly. I like prepaid. Right now my monthly charge is $40 so I'm waiting for Boost to release an LTE phone. The rumor mill has it that q1 2013 will see an LTE phone on Boost.

The TeleNav GPS software (powered by Tom Tom) is superb and it gives you real time traffic updates - and it's FREE. I found the phone a bit sluggish if you try to multitask, so that's kinda a downside. But, all in all, it's a strong and durable phone. I've dropped it on the floor a lot, and I've even accidentally submerged it once as well. For the most part, it bounced back strongly and works well.It has one major design flaw though. The memory of on the phone is only 117mb (of usable space) to the user.I know what you are thinking: \"just move any app's to the external memory card.\" What people DON'T tell you is that when you do this, all you're moving is SOME of the application's data to the memory card, the majority of the footprint of the app resides on the phone itself. So, after a few months your phone's free space shrinks. When applications update, it shrinks again. I've been fighting the \"low memory/storage\" battle now for 5 months. I clear the cash of all the apps, uninstall the updates from the android market/play, and now I've resigned to simply deleting the apps that I USE in order to keep my phone working.I will be buying another phone this weekend because of this.Now, if you don't want to download apps and you want a GPS on your phone that works REALLY WELL, then this is the phone for you.

Too bad this one was a swing and a miss.The negatives on this thing far outweigh the positives. The touch screen is haphazard at best...often failing to record keystrokes during typing. My phone also has a nasty habit of failing to respond when I hit the 'Hang Up' button during a phonecall. Not cool. The damn thing also POWERS ITSELF OFF half the time for no apparent reason. It's certainly not because of the battery...the life of it is pretty standard for a smartphone. I just don't understand how all of these issues got past development and into production...many others seem to have these problems as well.That being said...reception is fine and wireless/3G works as expected.

However, I was sick of the Big 3 (Verizon, AT&T;, Sprint) with their contracts, never-ending hidden fees, and constant headaches. I started looking around at other options, knowing the smaller, contract-free phone companies had started offering a more advanced selection of smartphones. I wanted T-mobile. Unfortunately, they covered a few towns around me in my somewhat rural area but hadn't extended their 4g coverage my way yet. So, I moved on to Boost, saw they piggy-backed on Sprint and coverage wouldn't be an issue. I began painstaking research on their smartphones. Although the Galaxy Prevail was the cheapest offering, it also had had some of the most consistently positive reviews. I gave it a shot.For the most part, I have not been disappointed. The initial price vs. functionality of this phone, considering the $60 contract-free monthly payment is amazing to consider. I have access to The Play Store and all the apps android has to offer without the hassles of those ridiculous phone companies. At the same time, Boost has got to cut those costs somewhere. They seemed to have done it in customer service. I haven't had any run-ins personally, but a couple relatives of mine told me tales of nightmares of payments lost, can't get on the line with a live person, then being transferred to four different people, etc... So, you just cross your fingers and hope nothing goes wrong. (Because all things considered, the price is still pretty good, and you're free to leave! No contract is a great feeling.)The phone itself does not come padded with tons of preloaded junk like other smartphones. However, there are a few apps (including THREE navigation apps) that you absolutely cannot remove from the phone. Initially, not much of a concern. However, you soon find out how much this sucks because the phone runs out of internal memory VERY fast. The number of apps you can have on the phone at any given time is extremely limited, depending on what they are. And even after you remove an app, small traces of it are left behind on your memory. Before long, you'll be forced to uninstall an app anytime you want a new one. Personally, I've been using an app called Memory Booster (full version is paid, but a couple dollars has literally made all the difference in the world) to help with this problem... not a fix, but it has helped immensely.Call me old school, but I've never been a huge fan of the onscreen touch keyboards in general. I prefer QWERTY keypads but I know I'm fighting a losing battle with this, less and less phones are including them, and I better get used to it. Unfortunately, the Samsung Galaxy Prevail was one of the more frustrating on-screen keyboards I've used. I also solved this problem using an app: the Smart Keyboard Pro is a huge improvement over the phone's included software: more responsive, calibration is easy and typing is quicker and accurate (even for my clumsy fingers.)I've never had any issues with call quality with this phone. Battery life is on par if not better than other smartphones of this type. Keep background data off, kill your apps with a task manager and you'll have no problem getting through the day with one charge.Overall, a good lower-end android smart phone from a contract-free cell phone company. You sacrifice a bit in the way of customer service but you can't expect everything at these prices. Biggest downfall of this phone is the lack of internal memory and inability to move many things to SD, making app download extremely difficult after a while. Learn to utilize android market to help tackle some of these challenges, (and remember why android OS rocks no matter what phone/carrier you have.) Bottom line, Boost's Samsung Galaxy Prevail is a very good bang for your buck if you're looking for a contract-free smartphone.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Bad", "Author": "Steven R.

No room for apps.", "Author": "Benjamin Fenster", "ReviewID": "R1W83TSB7XU1JT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The major problem with the Samsung Galaxy Prevail is that its internal storage is a tiny 117MB, and this causes serious issues you may not expect.You, like me, may assume the internal storage isn't a problem since Boost includes a 2GB microSD card right out of the box. That's plenty of room for apps, right? Unfortunately, each Android application decides for itself whether it can run on an SD card. Most of the applications I wanted to use (including mainstream choices like GMail and Facebook) would not move to the SD card. They would run only in that tiny 117MB space. (Don't take my word for it; a quick Google search will confirm this for you.)The phone also comes with several applications pre-installed that you cannot remove. The end result: you run out of room very quickly. And that's when the real trouble starts.Once the Galaxy Prevail runs out of storage, you'll stop getting notifications of new e-mail or other events, and sometimes even calls and text messages won't come through. That makes sense: if the phone has no room to store a new e-mail, how can it know there is one? Often the way I realized I was out of storage again was that I hadn't gotten any notifications in a while.As a temporary fix, you can periodically delete data you don't need to free up some room (there's a button to do this for each application), but you'll have to do that fairly often, and it works only if you have enough free space to begin with.CONCLUSION:The Galaxy Prevail is a perfectly adequate telephone. It makes calls, it sends and receives text messages, and it can even view websites with the built-in browser. If that's all you want from your Android device, this is a good way to get that functionality at a discount. And I don't mean that sarcastically; the built-in applications and features all worked very well, and some people may truly just want a phone that can also surf the web.But if you want to be able to install applications from the Android Market or \"Google Play\", this is not the phone for you.

While I have had no problems with Boost's coverage (except while traveling across the country, but I expected that), I have had many problems with this phone.  They include:1) After I excitedly installed about 5 apps, it told me that the memory was full.  I thought that I could solve that problem by buying a larger memory card, but the card wasn't full at all, and I had transferred as much as I could to the card. I ended up deleting almost all of the apps to try to free up internal memory space, but I have perpetually had the \"Phone storage space is getting low\" notification since the second week that I bought the phone, no matter how much I have deleted.2) I thought that I could also free up storage space by deleting some of the bloatware that came with the phone that I never use, but it doesn't let me delete any of those programs.3) Periodically, the phone stops receiving text messages because it tells me that my text message memory is full.  I then delete all of my messages, and I still get that message.  It usually goes away about a day later, but I don't know which messages I've lost in the meantime.4) Periodically, the phone decides to stop receiving emails.  It acts like it is searching for them and then loads my Inbox as if I haven't gotten anything new in the last 12 hours.  Then, I log onto my computer and discover several new emails.  About a day later, it starts receiving them again, but when it says that I have no new emails then I can never be sure if it's right or not.My Boost plan is now down to $50 per month for unlimited everything, which is nice, but I think I'm going to switch plans soon so that I can get an Iphone.

Periodically I've also had Nextel separately as well.  We live in Chicagoland and call our area the 'triangle', (in reference to the Bermuda triangle) because even though Sprint's coverage map shows there to be excellent coverage in our area, it is notoriously bad.  Calls are dropped all the time and 2 bars of signal is considered a victory.  We often use our phones in our home and no bars is the standard, on the top floor, near the window.  We complained so much, Sprint sent us a free Airave that boosted the signal indoors to about 2 bars on a good day.  Admittedly, I only use my phone to make phone calls, but my wife wanted to be able to surf the net and such.  We wanted an unlimited data plan and Sprint's was much too expensive per month.  Finally we came across a special on this Galaxy Prevail that we couldn't pass up; although I was hesitant initially because Boost runs on Sprint's network.  I figured if we could barely receive a Sprint signal outright, how much worse would it be via a secondary carrier?  Additionally, cancelling Sprint would mean returning the Airave and that would make matters worse.  However, we decided to give it a shot, cancelled Sprint, and after researching various ways to boost a cell signal indoors, we decided to purchase one of the Z-Boost devices and antennae.  Ironically, the day we disconnected the Airave and prepared to send it back, an odd thing happened.  The signal on the Galaxy Prevail jumped to about 4 bars!  We consistently get 3-4 bars and sometimes even 5 indoors now with no aftermarket equipment.  It seems as though the quality of the phone allows for locating a better signal or something.  I  was very pleasantly surprised.  It's 3G so it's not very fast at surfing but for $55/mo unlimited talk, text and data; along with 'shrinkage' eventually lowering that to $40/mo, we'll take it!!", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "don't buy", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1HVJ27CIXGO70", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you can afford a better phone don't buy the prevail, lack of memory space, sometimes will not let you hang up the calls .", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Graxias", "Author": "Neminemis", "ReviewID": "RVZRAW6QJJZP9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm happy except for the battery.

WE went to boost mobile, and asked them why they cut us off, The only thing they said was we went over 5 Gigs? I don't know what that means, but if it means we were limited on how much we could use the internet then boy they caught us. So i guess if you use the internet over 5 gigs they will cut you off.

It may work for other people, but personally, I do not recommended.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Maybe buyer's remorse but don't see this growing on me. 3 of 5", "Author": "R.

The network I was on was GSM, and didn't get even okay reception inside my house.  In a hope that a switch to a different signal band (CDMA) would be a better solution I bought this, and see that there's not. As the Daili Lama said, \"when you lose don't lose the lesson\" but frankly, man, that sucks.I got it yesterday and am feeling some regrets. Yes, I read up and heard the battery wasn't the best, but really?  Taken into account that I've been doing a lot with it (new phone can't help myself) the battery has been dissapointing.  I haven't made any phone calls, just a few texts, and about 30-45 min of gaming, and the battery is low.  (I have been using wifi but my old phone would never be depleted at 2:30p) Also, while my last phone-another android-took about two hours to charge, this one is taking forever. Definitely would've liked to known that before I got it. I guess this means I'll be charging overnight, which isn't my habit now, bc my sleep schedule changes alot and I also am a heavy phone user in bed.The selling point on this for me was it was gingerbread, decent sized, and had a good amount of internal memory over other basic androids.  The screen seems smaller than it could be with more black border than necessary- one of my previous phones was like that and I hated it-deduct a point. The keyboard is unforgiving in portrait for my thick fingers, and the screen sensitivity(or non-sensitivity) is cause for frustration.*Update:  I've now returned this phone for one reason: the internal memory.  The amount available to the user was little, but after all the app updates you aren't left with much for more than one game.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well..", "Author": "Amber", "ReviewID": "R2YHWSMJB9UYUM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pro- Phone works  perfectly fine.Con- Doesnt have a LCD light on the front of the phone. So unless you turn the screen on from time to time you dont know if you missed a call/Text/Email or any other notification.
