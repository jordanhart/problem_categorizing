However there are some many great software features that I don't think I could use another smart phone without them. One thing I love is the separate row of numbers on the keyboard. This makes for faster typing and less errors. Having a notification light is such a convenient feature.

Since I was changing cellular networks I decided it was time to update phones too. I had no idea  the excitement and joy I was in for. The phone is quick, has features galore. I do agree that the back casing is flimsy which is the only reason I didn't give it the last star. The camera has crisp clear photos with the ability to use both the front and rear view camera at the same time. I did get 32gb because of the OS space usage the reviews talked about. Bottom line is the phone is awesome  and I definitely would recommend it. I haven't added an otterbox yet but I am for added protection. a previous reviewer told about many other features.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone!", "Author": "PMar", "ReviewID": "R27BDFVVZJILX9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It has everything.

My use is very light. I've a Hyperion battery on order and will give that a shot, but I should not have to replace what was a perfectly good stock battery three (that's \"THREE\") months ago.I'm not the only victim with this problem. I regret buying the S4 and strongly advise others to avoid it. I've considerable computer, avionics, etc background and this level of \"performance\" is totally unsat. I have to keep this piece of guano connected to a charger to use it for more than a few minutes.If you feel compelled to get one of these, do yourself a favor and get additional batteries. At least they are replaceable, though I'd never buy a phone whose battery was not.A big vertical finger salute to the nice people who chose to defecate this product with unremedied known software and/or hardware defects on innocent customers. Thanks for nothing. I will revile this expensive annoyance to all who will listen that I may save them exasperation. Multi-billion-dollar companies have zero excuse for this conduct.EDIT:I just bought an Otterbox Defender case and modded it to clear the Hyperion battery (both obtained via Amazon) per the instructions on the xda developers forum.

Burger re: how much space is used by the firmware and junk installed by carriers that can't be removed.Overall I really dig this phone, it was an upgrade from an HTC Inspire that I'd had for several years. The difference in power and function is like night and day compared to my old phone. Plus, the large viewing screen and light weight even had my wife - an Apple-phile - a bit envious, especially after the iOS7 debacle (although she refuses to give me the satisfaction by admitting it).I recommend this phone, it was worth the money.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "Jeff Jones", "ReviewID": "R1Y90MDBNZWYGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It really seems odd , in a way,  to call it a phone.  It obviously is a phone but it's so much more than that. Like a lot of \"phones\" today it's a pc or a super-pda with a phone,  a high quality camera,  and too much to explain here.

I had the HTC EVO 4G LTE which had roughly the same size screen as this thing so perhaps that is what I disliked the most about this thing. I selected this when I came to AT&T; because I'd heard such great things about it but the other line on my phone account  got the LG Optimus Pro & I found I really liked the screen size on the LG. What I didn't like about the LG was the operating system & LG's general lack of updating their past phones. I exchanged this phone for the Samsung Note 3 which should arrive today. This phone seemed to take good pictures. I really liked the removable battery & micro sd card options. I didn't find any of the lagginess issues I've seen mentioned in other reviews of this phone but then I only tried to use it for a few days. I wanted a bigger screen but I would recommend this phone for anyone else that wants a smaller screened device. I tend to use my phone more for the none phone features than for talking on it & when I am talking on it I am usually using either speakerphone or a hands free bluetooth device.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good phone but not outstanding.", "Author": "Lachu", "ReviewID": "R2C0UISI56RAHY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am an iOS user for the past 4 years. I took a major decision in switching over to android.  This phone has ton of features to begin with and compared to Iphone 5. I was desperate to use a little bigger and wider screen envying android users. 5s didn't meet my expectations so I switched to S4. Battery life is decent lasting for a day. The only reason I am giving a 4 star is due to lack of fluid and smooth navigation of OS. I see a touch lag, spinners while launching the android Apps which I haven't experienced in Iphone OS or in their Apps. I am loving the phone with a positive attitude. Camera is good but very slower while processing night shots or in few modes. I hate the processing bar which prevents to take fast pictures.
