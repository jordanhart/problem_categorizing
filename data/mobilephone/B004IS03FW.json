I was under the impression it did NOT need a data package. When I finally got it(it took about 2 weeks for them to actually ship it) I tried to switch my current phone to the Lg Env3. I tried doing over the internet and verizon decided to tell me it needed a data package. I was like, \"fml\" I just payed $100.00 for the damn phone and the accesories. On top of that, I threw away all of the paper work. I then decided to go in to the actual verizon store. The guy told me it would be an extra $10.00 a month(which honestly isn't much) for this phone. I continued to tell him that I had done a ton of research and it doesn't need the data package to work properly. He continued to tell me I needed to pay the extra $10 for 2gb of data. Rip off.. Lol. I wasn't about to stop there. When I got home I called customer service. After explaining my situation, the guy I was on the phone with told me it did NOT need the data package and he could take it off for me. Thank the lord. Anyways, lonog story short, this phone does NOT need a data package. Just call the customer service and they will help you out and take the data package off. Here is the number I called:507-385-3300.

I have had plenty of phones and this one tops them all by far.  I have been described as a \"monster texter\" and this phone is great for that.  But it also has a super camera and operates perfectly as a phone.  Even after my guy got me an iPhone I insisted on keeping this phone, too, because nothing facilitates texts like this and it doesn't impose bizarre spelling on my words.  When the battery started to fade, I got a new one.  Now the phone is getting a little old and it is starting to turn off by itself.  But I have been so pleased with it that I am ordering a new one from an Amazon vendor as opposed to buying a refurbished one from Verizon.

Hamm", "ReviewID": "R2234I3BNMSNHS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i didnt purchase this phone from this seller. I infact purchased it from Verizon, but I just felt the need to share that I have had this phone for almost 2 years now, and has proved itself to be very tough. I tend to be very hard on my phones, so I steer away from smart phones with delicate touch screens. I probably drop my phone a couple of times a week on the concrete on accident and it just keeps on going, hah. I will say, I believe they have stopped making software updates for this phone, because I was having a few minor problems with the phone freezing up and having a hard time viewing my images on it, and the customer service at my verizon store said I needed to upgrade. Well, popping the battery out and back in fixes the problem for a while, so as long as it is still making phone calls, I'm good to go. If you have the same non-materialistic view as me about cell phones, this little phone is a great investment. Just don't get the internet package, use it for texting, pictures, and calls, and it is a cheap awesome phone. Just look for it somewhere else.

In the meantime, I had also done some research on the phone, which I should have done beforehand.  And, found out it is a battery issue with this particular phone.

I love it so much, I am so impressed! Great for texting, even if you have bigger fingers because the qwerty keyboard is so spacious. The battery, at first, I wasn't impressed with because it lasted about a day AND after it died, I put it on charge when I went to sleep (this was the very first time I charged it, so that may have something to do with it too). When I woke up, (about 9 hours later) it was still charging! It took about 10 hours to charge the first time. BUT as I have used it over this past month and charged it when it died, the battery life is much longer. It once lasted for 5 days without a charge. That being said, don't judge the battery right away, it gets better as you use it. I would recommend this phone to anybody! I'm 15 and to be honest, it's REALLY not necessary to have an expensive smartphone. They have the most problems that come along as you use it and they are annoying. AND the data plans are so expensive, which every smartphone requires. But, if you are on the go all the time, and you constantly need a phone that accesses the internet and gets directions, and what not. Then maybe its for you.

It's the perfect size, I love the keyboard design (flips open and is perfect for texting), and has everything I need. When mine decided to stop working over the summer after 3 years of use, I went to amazon to buy another just like it. I bought my second enV3 from the seller Just Cellular. Well, this phone is a piece of crap. It randomly shuts off (even during phone calls), sometimes refuses to charge, and as of today there is no audio for incoming and outgoing calls. Also, the outside color is maroon, but the display themes were for the blue model. This makes me think that the phone was not brand new, although it is supposed to be. There was only a 30 day return policy and my phone didn't start acting up until after a month and a half of use. Therefore, I've been stuck with it. I really do not want to part with the enV3. I cannot stand smartphones and anything with a touch screen, so I am definitely caught between a rock and a hard place. Overall, the enV3 is a good phone. I had just gotten a defective one the second time around.

My experience with Verizon was inconsistent after having spoken with several more customer service reps.  One explained that the enV3 was indeed compatible with prepaid plan....for $50-70 per month: about the same price as a low-end data package for this phone.  Another just plain wouldn't offer a pre-paid plan at all.  Verizon is schizophrenic with regard to this phone.  I continue to look for the $35/month plan explained to me at the Verizon store.Further, my review can't be about the phone itself because of conflicting activation information.  I submitted this review because I felt that activation issues were just as important as the phone's performance and features.  That, and if you've been encouraged to buy this phone because it's supposed to qualify for a Verizon pre-paid plan, you should also know that those monthly fees are probably going to be more expensive than even the Verizon store managers actually know.  This is important for people on lower, fixed incomes who want a decent, modest phone with a tactile keyboard who can't afford a data package.____________________________I bought two of these phones recently based on advice from the Verizon store near me.  I explained that I used wireless very little and mostly for texting.  I wanted a dedicated qwerty board.  So, I tried to to activate the phone today and three different folks at Verizon (online) told me that the ENV3 is NOT considered a \"basic\" cell phone and requires a data package account.  What that means is that instead of $35/month for a basic phone (LG Cosmos, et. al.), the least charge for an ENV3 is $70 with a $60 activation fee.  Verizon considers the ENV3 a \"data-ready\" phone, the same as a smart phone!Misinformation from Verizon stores sucks!

I purchased this phone when it came out at the begining of 09 and I still currently have it in use. The cell is very easy to navigate, it takes good pictures, videos and easy to use keyboard. The cell has a memory card slot so you can store your pictures, music, videos on the card instead of phone and it doesn't eat your battery life. Good loud volume for the ringtones and music. It is very though since it's been dropped several times and the phone still good, looks like new and in working conditions. The only downside of this phone is that the battery life won't last like the phone will but actually is not a downside when I have used the phone 24/7 (talking for hours and hours (more than 4 hours at a time), texting as well while talking, taking pictures and videos all the time; more that 800 contacts with addresses, email addresses stored in the phone, and a lot a lot of music like an ipod) and that battery lasted for 2 years. I tried to get the battery at the cell company but they wanted me to upgrade (saying that my phone was old and they had new ones) but most of the new phones have way less battery life that this one. Too bad the cell company stopped selling this specific phone because is the best basic phone I have owned and that is me owning a lot (more than 39) of cell phones through out the years.

It was supposed to be a home phone replacement, in the place of an AT&T; landline (no more copper wires, thank you very much).Anyway, I like this so much even over the other touchscreen phone I have. I may take the time to switch it over to regular mobile use (e.g. sending out msgs saying I'm going with a new phone number, etc., etc.).The qwerty keyboard is nice, and far easier to use than any touchscreens I've seen so far. I send more texts than anything else, about 90 to 180 an month, even more sometimes. Although voice is great, texting is just handier and less time consuming, and it gets the job done far far better -- especially when you can type fast enough without retyping those mishits on touchscreens.Everything about this phone is great, overall quality, voice sound, music, on-board tools, battery life, added features, and especially the keyboard. I'd definitely tell a friend to get one. It's for certain an older phone, but it has it's advantages over touchscreens and the tricky smartphones that might take over your real life (they're too quirky). I like keeping it simple, but still be able to do all the things most people like to do, including a GPS app. At a fraction of the price of a droid, touchscreen, there are enough bells, whistles, and gongs to keep you in the mainstream without throwing 600 bucks down the drain.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Reliable phone", "Author": "Paula Burke", "ReviewID": "R27BQJEIH66R5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to replace an env3 that I had used for almost 3 years.

Got off to a rocky start in that the first phone I received I had to return it as it had problems and according to verizon it was not a \"new\" phone despite it saying it was.  They discovered it had been used by one other person.  After about a week it had problems.  The main reason being that it constantly shut itself off and thus you lost your call, or if you were texting you lost your text,the battery indicator always showed \"full\" leaving you with no idea what was left. The battery itself kept falling out and Verizon said to put a small piece of a business card under the battery and it would hold it in place.  I returned the phone not wanting to have these problems with a \"new\" phone.  But I still wanted this particular phone.  I found someone in NY that had brand new ones and got one from them and have had it now for a month and have not had a single problem with it and it is such fun to use.  It is considered a \"border line dumb phone\" but when you go to register it with Verizon for the $50 a month prepaid plan with unlimited talk and text, it won't let you. It's serial number indicates it is a smartphone because you can access email but as I understood it you did need a data package to do that. Others say you don't. It has a small amount of multi media that would work with a data package.  But I don't care about that stuff because all I wanted was a simple great little phone with the qwerty keyboard.  If I want to get on line, etc.  I have my laptop to do all that.  I just don't need to be paying for a phone to do the same thing my laptop does I also paying for.  Call me frugle.  I absolutely adore this little phone, it is easy to use, comfortable to hold, great sound quality, clear.  The one thing that I was instantly sold on and wish more phones would be like this one is to get to its keyboard all you do it turn it sideways and open it up!  The keyboard does not slide out, it just rolls back!  Thus it is very slim with no bulk.  It comes in both burgundy and dark blue.  I got the burgundy one and am not sorry. I just wish the phones would come with a user's manual.  They seem to all be on line now. That sucks.  I printed mine off and took it to an office supply store and had it trimmed down to a manageable 5x7 size and put a spiral binder on the top.  Works for me.  That's the only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of a 5 star.  The phone itself is a 5 star!

I had an enV2 which I loved (and is my husband's phone now) but Verizon no longer carries the phone in their store or on-line.  So I ordered this one (enV3).  What a mistake!!!  Worked great for the first 7 weeks.  Then it had to be recharged all the time.  And the power would be totally drained within 15 minutes after it had been fully charged.  I thought it was the battery and ordered a new one.  Same thing happened.  So obviously it's the phone and not the battery.  So I ended up sending the battery back and it's costing me about half the purchase price since Amazon says it wasn't at fault.

I was secretly kind of hoping she would say she liked her old one better, but, alas, she absolutely LOVES this phone!  She likes the slim feel, and the way it opens, simple to figure out, and says the keyboard is much easier for her to use - maybe a little more space between the keys and/or slightly larger (?)  She is very pleased - and even more so because red is her favorite color.The one drawback is that it does not come with a manual (there is a note that says they're trying to be \"green\" and save resources), but instead has a little mini-CD (she said her computer won't read it), and when she went to the website that the seller included in the package, she was not able to find a manual for her model.  I think I'll be able to find one at the manufacturer's website, but they SHOULD have included a manual, rather than expecting people to hunt one down and either read it on the computer or have to print it out - that's ridiculous, a definite negative, and the only reason it got 4 stars in stead of 5.
