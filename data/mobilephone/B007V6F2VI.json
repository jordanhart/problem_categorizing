I saw this on Amazon,looked at the reviews and then did more research on it. Heat wise, its fine. I work in a kitchen and usually it's around 125-130 on a good day and the phone still works fine for me. I noticed once that the battery itself was getting a bit hot, but that's because one of my brothers put it near the stove.My only gripe is sometimes the touch screen is a little iffy. But once you know where to touch to make it go where you want it to, it's perfect", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this phone :D", "Author": "Cristine", "ReviewID": "R1EFLKKU89D1MZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've struggled with finding the perfect phone for nearly a year now and I must say I think I found it. I'm constantly sending emails and as much as I loved my LG900G I really needed to upgrade. Prior to using the LG900G I had the iPhone 3G but after a terrible experience with Apple .. I went to prepaid. Net10 has really okay phones but failed to offer a plan that fit my needs.I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this phone because after seeing many reviews about this phone I've learned that some have unresponsive touch screens ( but what android phone doesn't ?) . I've had this phone for nearly a week and it's really great! It takes amazing pictures and has good voice quality, the texting is fast with the SWIPE keyboard makes it a bit faster. The messenger has a bit of a time keeping up with me since I speed text. The phone was fully unlocked and came with a charger adapter, USB/storage cable, battery, and the original AT&T; box with instruction manual. Phone had no marks, scratches, smudges, or anything on it. I flashed this over with T-Mobile I use the $25 monthly plan since I mostly use wifi for my data and I have apps for texting and talking with friends. The only downside for this is there's not a case for it which sort of sucks ( I've seen a few on Amazon but they were like $15 and not in any colors I would like). I would recommend a screen protector though since it attracts dust and fingerprints very quickly. Also, when I showed it to family members and friends they could not believe the price I paid for it ( a little over $85) vs top of the line phones ranging $400 and up?", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "It awesome", "Author": "Eryka", "ReviewID": "R1JMMLTLRY6PK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works fine I love it I needed a new phone I'm glade I got this one it has a full key bored n head phone plus to listen to music n memory card slot love it", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Emergency Annoyance", "Author": "belkatem", "ReviewID": "RT5RK1AZHC4ZT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just to be clear, this is a PRODUCT REVIEW and not Amazon specific.I purchased a Sharp FX Plus from a wireless store and the if it was anywhere near any kind of heat (body heat or a window) the thing would continuously dial the emergency numbers by itself when the lock screen was enabled. So you couldn't put it in your pocket at all! I had the phone master reset twice, they tried removing the 911 number but it was locked by the software so I added additional emergency numbers but then the phone would call ALL the emergency numbers. If you don't have privacy issues and the lock screen isn't necessary... you will be fine. Through my phone provider we tried replacing the phone itself, thinking it was THAT phone, but the new Sharp called 911 the day after initializing. We then tried replacing the SIM card, thinking it may have been corrupt, two days after replacing the card it dial 911 three different times. I immediately requested a different model phone and I no longer have that problem. If you find that you have this problem... be careful because the police dept CAN and WILL fine you for these calls because they are considered prank calls.On a side note, Amazon is awesome!", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "phone showed up with all items and just as described", "Author": "chuck", "ReviewID": "R3BCPQVUO8PW9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "at first I was sketchy on getting this phone from the reviews I read but since ive got this phone I am very pleased with it and all it can do love the wifi no extra fews for data on bill and my tmobile card worked it as if it was made for I have had no problems with this phone works wonderfully and I would recommend this phone for anyone looking for a cheap dependable android phone 1 other thing get a sreen protector wish I would of when I got it but I will now lol  finger prints add up on the screen", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sharp and clear picture, fast and a great deal", "Author": "Nick N", "ReviewID": "RPH9T5E5LFVYJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little phone is pretty cool!

After my mom died 2 years ago, I decided to keep her phone # as my second cell line and was looking to replace it with a newer phone. I did NOT want to get a phone that requires a data plan, though. Most 4G phones do require you to have a data plan, whether or not you use it.This phone fit the bill, exactly. The ONLY negative thing about this phone is the internal phone storage. The Android/Google apps take up most of the phone space, along with the APK setup files for those, which cannot be moved or deleted.That appears to be the only drawback to this phone.Touch screen is extremely sensisitve, and I now have 2 of these phone, got one for my niece and a friend, and they are ALL very sensitive, so I don't know what people's gripes are about the touch screen.If you want a phone that does NOT require a data plan get this one. It works fine. You can't find ANY cases to put the phone in, though. DON'T get the SKINOMI. It's NOT a case, they're adhesive stickers that just are stuck onto the phone.If the phone had MORE internal storage space, I'd give it 5 stars.

This was an important feature that I wanted.2) The phone I received was not an unlocked phone. I tried using it with two SIM cards with active accounts on two different carriers. Neither one worked. I've set up SIMS to work with unlocked phones before, and it should have worked if was unlocked.3) Amazon needs to do a better job of ensuring that products sold by different vendors accurately match up with product descriptions. Customers should not have to go through the inconvenience of making a return if the product they received was as they expected in the first place.4) With regard to point 1, I even sent an email to the vendor using Amazon's email contact method to get clarification/confirmation. I was contacted by a rep, but I'm 98% sure it was from off-shore reps of Amazon (no disrespect to Ranvijay S., and Jagan R.), and not a contact directly from the vendor with any actual technical knowledge of the product. When asked about the FM feature, here is part of the reply I got: \"I checked it on our website and can confirm that the phone has FM Radio included.\". Duh, I can read the website! But if the website is wrong, what good does that do anybody?I suppose if you want a really cheap Android phone as a backup (which is what I wanted it for) its probably decent.

I've only had the LG less than 6 months and its screen already shattered. This isn't the phone I ordered. The one I received says 3.megapixel camera and its keyboard is all black. Okay, that wasn't too bad because these models are similar. So it was charged for a number of hours and I couldn't get it to connect with Net10. It was going to go back to the warehouse when my son came. He looked at it and said to wait. He went my main computer, pulled up Net10, keyed in some info from the New phone and its working. I had no idea to do that! Dollars to donuts, others who have purchased an unlocked phone had a similar situation. So check out if you might need to connect with your account online first.
