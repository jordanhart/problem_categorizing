{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great For Most!  w/KitKat", "Author": "DonaldWhite", "ReviewID": "R1YTD3HYXQYZ6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My take on the phone after using it for a day or so.I am a google fanboy. I have google tattooed on my forearm. I really really wanted this phone to be a stopping point on my endless search for MORE. More power. More ram. More gimmicks. So i bit the bullet and ordered my moto x on verizon.com partly due to finding a 50 dollar coupon Verizon30.Speed wise. this thing is smooth. All actions feel extremely quick and responsive. This will be more than perfect for 90% of the people who will undoubtedly purchase this phone.aesthetically this phone is quite nice. the backing with its little Motorola indent is really nice to hold. it feels soft but durable. its actually quite a pleasure to use for any amount of time.The screen looks so much more vibrant than my galaxy nexus. and the active display i find to be actually useful. The screen only turns on the pixels it needs to display your notifications so it doesnt use as much battery life as youd thinkI Felt i should mention the NO SD Card Slot. I always thought this would bother me. But after the Galaxy nexus i found that i really didnt need it. In a age of subscriptions. I currently have Spotify, Netflix, SiriusXm, and Google All Access, i just dont store that much on my phone or the stuff i fill it with i hardly ever use more of a security blanket in those scarce offline times.\"ALMOST\" stock android experience. This is one of the unspoken heros of this phone. Although Verizon has installed their typical bloatware. Motorola itself has not messed with too much. I would have preferred STOCK. this is seriously the next best thing .Active Display. I love active display. for those who dont know active display is the automatic updates that get displayed on your screen while the phones in standby. With active display only turning on the pixels it needs to display the relevant information it barely uses any battery life. This is one feature i dont know how i will live without in the future.Now to my gripes.First is battery. This phone was touted to be one of the most efficient phones on the market with its specially designed hardware. It is not what i expected at all. While the always listening chip is great. and actually works well. The battery life is no better than any other phone ive seen on the market. i say this because most phones in which have the highest complaints also have the ability to remove the battery and add a bigger one. THIS phone does not have that option. and thus is crippling to someone who was expecting at least 18-20 hours on above average use. with sending a few text messages throughout the day and listening to a album or two on all access i got about 8 1/2 - 9 hours. This may be ok for most. but i believe a phone should be able to make it a full day.Especially this one with its \"ENERGY SAVING Chipset and Screen.\" In the day and age where outlets and usb ports are everywhere we look, there is still something unnerving knowing that you better bring your charger wherever you go just in case.And Second. and this is completely VERIZONS fault. and was almost a reason to switch to ATT. MOTOMAKER!!. Motomaker felt like a breathe of fresh air. being able to customize almost every detail of the outside of your phone. This felt important to me. It inspired faith in Motorola and in Google. it Screamed unique! BUT of course as usual, Verizon botches everything. Is it really worth it to wait 4 months after a phone comes out to customize it. a phone might i add that has mid level specs.Verizon really needs to get there butts in gear. i feel like they have screwed up every launch of every flashship phone in years. Either they don't have it in stores. or they don't update it. or they just plain ole don't have it period.Understand that this is the sum of all averages type of phone. The Peoples Phone. Mid level specs. Mid level build quality. MID LEVEL. it is perfect for the bulk of the market. A phone id get my parents and trust they'd be fine. For someone who uses there phone for more than that 2 texts a day and a phone call to the pizza guy at night. You might want to wait for something else or at the very least the price to drop to something like $150/contract - $450/offThe last thing i would like to mention is Motorola's track record with their software updates. They have been notoriously bad and we have yet to see if Motorola under the Ownership of Google will have any affect on that.UPDATE: Hell has frozen over. Motorola just updated the moto x to kitkat.  Only 3 weeks after kitkat came out.  Extremely impressive considering that one it was on verizon and two my girlfriends nexus 4 still hasnt been upgraded.UPDATE : Original Phone had a bad proximity sensor. So anytime I would make a call the screen would shut off and no matter what I would do would get it to turn the screen back on.. And thus you couldnt end a call or get to the dialpad. Also because there is no removable battery there was no way (to my knowledge) to turn off the phone to reset it. (UPDATE) A FRIENDLY COMMENTER BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT HOLDING DOWN THE POWER BUTTON FOR 10 SECONDS WILL POWER DOWN THE PHONE)Verizon did send me a brand new phone which works perfectly and gets much better battery life. i am now getting 17 hours of use on a normal day.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love Moto X", "Author": "dav", "ReviewID": "R2XLJN5K9CO0YD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I watched the pre launch hype about this phone and couldnt wait to give it a try.

Admittedly, you have to accept some of the \"issues\" with this phone up front if you're going to enjoy it.  It has a locked bootloader (so no custom ROMs), no microSD card capability, you can't change the battery, and the camera is just OK though not bad.  If you can live with those things, this is an excellent phone.  The screen is clear and a very usable size, the handset is light, and it feels good in your hand.  The most outstanding feature on the phone in my mind is the touchless control.  This is amazing; it even understands my wife who has a thick Russian accent and my dad who has a strong southern accent.  You can send texts, find your phone when you've lost it, play music, ask inane questions and get accurate answers, and lots more without even touching the device.  My wife loves it as most voice control out there does not understand her but this rarely has problems.  The battery started out mediocre but software updates have it lasting much longer so we now have no issues out of battery life.  The phone is very responsive seeing as it's nearly stock Android.  Outside of the camera, maybe - just maybe - the battery, I would stack any feature of this up against an iPhone and it would come out just as good or better.  I really like the direction Motorola is taking now.  Many of their apps are offered on the Google Play store so they can do updates without having to update the whole OS and wait for the carrier to approve.  Verizon is notorious for being the last to approve an OS update so this keeps you getting fixes and new features as quick as the manufacturer creates them.  And, this is running Kit Kat, Android 4.4, the latest version -- it was updated before some Google Nexus devices were!  Phone reception and call quality are unremarkable which is good; that means it has always worked when we needed and it has us just assuming we can call whenever and get a clear line.  Once you factor in the cost, this is easily a five star phone.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Republic Wireless $299 Moto X No Contract", "Author": "Jeff Mahin", "ReviewID": "R14ZS8D81REZIG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I paid $299 for my no contract Moto X from Republic Wireless. I have been with Republic Wireless for a month now and love them!! I pay $25 a month for unlimited talk, text, and 3G data. You can get unlimited everything including 4G data for $40 a month or you can switch to the $10 a month plan and you get unlimited talk and text anywhere but only can use data on WiFi but you can switch you plan 2 times a month from your phone and the rates are prorated so you only get charged for the days you use that plan!! The Moto X is an awesome phone!! I actually like it better than my iPhone 5 because the phone itself has features that the iPhone does not have (twist your wrist and the camera starts and its a better camera than the iPhone, it knows when you are driving and reads you texts, and active notifications are very nice too).

This thing is just all around great.The best way to discribe it is QUICK. It doesnt have blow-you-away stats but its not shabby in that reguard either. What doesnt jump out at you immediatly until you use it for a while is the multiple processors are dedicated to different tasks.

The very first thing I noticed with this phone is the battery life. I frequently forget to turn off my wifi when leaving for work in the morning. Since there is no wifi at work, my S3 would be around 35-40% battery left upon getting home. That's over the course of 9 hours. With my new moto, I don't even bother turning it off. My battery has about 85% left when i get home. The screen looks good and apps run smoothly. Running the 8 cores seperately really seems to make this phone very efficient. Touchless controls work way better than i was expecting. I thought the \"double twist instant on\" camera  would be a minor feature for this phone.

Stock Android is a thing of beauty that Samsung, LG, and even Motorola's Droid line seem to enjoy messing up with their decorations. I had Kit Kat before any of my Android geek friends, and other Android or Google updates seem to come before anyone else gets them. Thanks, Google ownership!My state enacted new laws recently prohibiting even a touch of a phone, so the all-voice Touchless Control is incredible. It's accurate and responsive, and has saved me a ton of time. The first time I was driving around and my phone knew I was driving and offered to read my text to me, I was blown away. Goodbye Apple. The biggest concern for me was size. I hate having stuff in my pockets, and even went with the iPhone 4S over Android phones before because there weren't really any small-platform Android phones. This thing gives you a 4.7\" screen in a platform barely larger than the iPhone 4S, and because of the back taper, it honestly feels smaller in the pocket. Good job, Google.The Assist modes are super helpful. I no longer have to make sure my phone is on silent. I just manage my Google calendar and the phone does the rest. No more having to remember to set \"Do not disturb\" mode, either. You can tell the Moto X when to not interrupt your sleep, and it keeps going for you.I've installed a lot of apps, I'm a pretty heavy user, and I didn't know how to close apps for several days (I was an iOS guy before, so it took me a while to really master a new product!) and everything was butter-smooth. It was incredibly refreshing coming off an iPhone 4S that had grown slow and weary. Those yelling \"last-year's specs\" haven't used this thing. If you want a Galaxy S4 that has better processing power than your laptop, then go right ahead, but there's no way you're going to actually notice a difference between spec-monster overpowered phones and the Moto X.Cons: screen white isn't quite white - it's more of an ivory color. Apple's color response was a little better in the whites, but I'll deal. Also, I'm a little upset about the way they managed the release of wood backs. They rumored and showed four wood styles, rumored a $50 price for a real wood back, and then released only bamboo (not even real wood - it's grass!) for $100 extra. Thankfully, Toast released a real wood Moto X cover for a quarter of that price and it's awesome.All in all, this is a great phone. I highly recommend it.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone but....", "Author": "Kehn John Hermano", "ReviewID": "RUJOO9GGPU9N6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is the best to what an awesome Android OS phone can bring. There are 2 Cons to this phone and it's both the hardware.1: Camera can't take good low light shots, you might as well be a person to use this phone is moderate lighting or broad daylight.2: Speaking of broad daylight, this phones SCREEN glares up all the sunlight, even at full brightness. You will barely see your content on your phone if your outside trying to take pictures or using it for anything. I would recommend to you an AntiGlare (Matte) Screen protector for this phone to rid of this Con by the least of your concerns.Summing it up, this phones features on top of the Android OS is not clunky, very low bloatware, awesome touch-less assist features. This phone always listen to your voice for when you want to say \"Ok Google Now\" and the great thing about this phone is that it runs quick and smooth, battery can last me all day if used moderately and 3-4 days if all I use it for is phone calls and texts during the weekdays since I am busy.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect phone", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "R2WXDEJM44MP9U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am currently using the moto x and have been for about a year now.

I can't wait until the moto x+1 comes out until then this phone is great.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "As close as a cell phone gets to perfect.", "Author": "Jacob W. Morgan \"JMorg\"", "ReviewID": "R2F09EMXS60UIT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only reason I say almost perfect is because every cell phone is missing something. I have had the Moto X since December 4th and I have to say I love this phone. It may not have all of the top tear specs of all the other flagships but I don't care about specs. I care about how it functions in the real world.Performance: This phone is extremely quick and snappy. Zero lag when multitasking, opening apps or connecting to the internet. Gets a great cell signal and the internet is very fast on it. Games run really well.Call quality: This is where motorola has always shined and it really shows with the Moto X. People say I sound like I'm talking on a land line and calls are clear on my end as well.Screen: The screen is not going to be as bright or as clear as some of the other flagships because it has a lower resolution to conserve battery life. 720p instead of 1080p. That being said, you will have no problems with this screen. It is beautiful and looks great when gaming and watching videos. Reading text on kindle or the internet is very easy and clear as a bell. The screen size is 4.7\" which I think may be the sweet spot for using a phone with one hand.Build: This phone is extremely solid and feels great in your hand. The back has a nice curve to it which makes it natural to hold. It looks extremely nice and has absolutely no branding on the front which was a classy move. Because of the minimized bezel this is the smallest phone with a 4.7\" screen you will find. Very easy to use in one hand. It is light, but not so light that it feels cheap. \"just right\" if you will.Software: It runs a very slightly modified version of stock android. The user interface is simple, intuitive and great to look at. Very classy, not cartoony like Galaxy Touchwhiz UI. Using very little RAM so the performance is top notch and really doesn't use a lot of battery life.Battery life: With how small the battery is it is amazing how good the battery life is. With extremely heavy use, gaming, checking email, using gps, streaming music and watching Youtube, the battery lasts all day. With moderate use, checking email, watching a couple of videos and a little more general use, texting and so forth, the phone will last you well into a second day of use. I'd say about about 36 hours of moderate use (if you sleep in that time period).Camera: The camera quality is very good outside in natural light, but could be better in low light. I still get great photos in low light, but you might have to take 2 or 3 pictures to get a good one. The camera software is very easy to use. Considering it's a camera on a cell phone I think it's does the job. I'd give the camera 4 out of 5 stars.What sets it apart: 1)There is a function called \"active notifications\" that is wonderful. You can view any of your notifications without unlocking the phone, the time comes up when you pick up the phone. You can also unlock the phone on the screen rather than using the power button. When the notifications or time comes up there are very few pixels being utilized so it does not hurt the battery life 2)You can bring the camera up when the phone is locked with just a flick of the wrist. It is an unusual gesture, but you'll get used to it. From your phone being locked you can take a picture in 2 seconds (not exaggerating). All my friends who have kids love this function, they never miss a cute picture. 3) Touchless control: All you have to say is \"ok google now\" and you have full access to Google Now voice control. That means when your phone is locked and sitting on your night stand, from across the room you can say \"ok google now.......what's up?\" and it will respond with the time and all notifications that you haven't viewed. Get in your car and say \"ok google now.....navigate home\" and google maps pops up and tells you how to get home. 4) Assist is a program that has preset features to make things in your life easier. A few examples, I have my phone set so at midnight every night the ringer on my phone turns off and will only ring if someone on my emergency list calls. When I have a meeting scheduled the ringer turns off. When I start driving a music app launches and so forth. 5) The X8 processor is what brings everything together. It is actually 8 different processors so everything on the phone is compartmentalized for performance optimization and battery conservation. 6) Last but not least, the Moto Maker Site. You can fully cosmetically customize the Moto X. The back and the buttons can be whatever color you want. Even wooden if you're into that type of thing. The back can be monogrammed with your name and you can even get matching headphones.So, if you haven't noticed, I would like to reiterate that I love this phone. I am an experienced smartphone user and this is the best phone I have owned and one of the best on the market in my opinion. All smartphones are lacking something, Iphones have small screens and the software can't be customized, but they are fast, have great cameras and great build quality. Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 have cheap build quality and a really bad UI that looks cheap and slows down the whole phone, but they have great cameras and big beautiful screens. HTC One M7/M8 has the worst camera of any flagship phone and bad battery life, but they have beautiful screens, great performance and awesome build quality. LG G2 is a great phone with everything that you would ever want, but all those great things are useless when you have to use a button that's on the back of the phone, that's just stupid. In my humble opinion, the Moto X is as close as it gets.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love everything about it.", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R2NS5ELLU4GNJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like it it has a sleek finish and performs really well. the voice activation works well and i use more than i thought i would. the battery life has been exceptional and obviously depends on usage but if im minimally on it like listening to pandora but not using the screen frequently it will be down to like 75% after 8 hours. ive dropped it in a sink of water and grabbed it out quickly and it still works then by puppy dumped my beer on it and it sat in it for awhile and still not any issues. the dimple is nice and unique and i got a supcase that keeps the dimple and shows the white carbon fiber back so its been great. i actually take more pictures now than i did before because it is so quick to activate the camera and use. the pictures are good quality since motorola sent out an update that fixed it. ive thought about getting a new phone but i cant see how the other ones do anything better than mine. if i do ever update i will miss the unique features even tho they may not seem important they are nice to have.1 con tho that i have been experiencing lately is that when i wearing basketball shorts and run up stairs with my phone in my pocket it will activate the camera and take pictures if its facing my leg.other than that im not sure i would get another phone", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone but its voice command has scary results", "Author": "Sugar+Rosie \"Sugar+Rosie\"", "ReviewID": "R1KI5X3DMQ6R08", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought the Moto X 'cuz I wanted a screen smaller than 5\", attracted to the pop-up notifications of incoming messages when the phone is in sleep mode and the \"shake to go direct to camera\" feature.  Everyone else has written so much will stick to my biggest cons.Camera:  terrible quality even on highest settings.  Results look fuzzy.  Compared to what? iPhone 5, Galaxy S5? No.  My 2006 1.3 mp flip phone camera takes better photos.Voice command feature \"Okay Google Now\":  incredibly sensitive with scary results.  The phone would wake up & react to those words even when sitting 20 feet away while I was on the land line with tech support asking how to control that feature.Deal breaker for me:  in a settlement meeting, the phone was in my suit inside pocket, reacted to the mention of opposing counsel's name by someone else in the room and dialed his number.  It took frantic repeated pressing of the power/end buttons to stop the call.  Was about to drop it into a jug of water on the table to kill the call as the phone didn't react until it got the other party's voice mail.  Had my jacket been on my chair in the corner, had I not heard the phone dialing out, and had the other side picked up the call, he could've listened in to the entire meeting.We've all made or received accidental \"butt dials\", but this takes it to the next level as the phone could react while simply sitting on a desk.  On 2 other occasions, without even saying those 3 magic words, the phone woke up and made random calls.  This all happened in one day.  18hrs after turning it on, it was packaged & returned.  The voice command is so sensitive, I had Verizon disable the phone number as I was afraid the phone could accidentally wake up in transit and I'd get a huge 4G data bill while it tracked its own route cross country.Comfort:  as much as every \"pro reviewer\" raves how comfortable the phone is to hold with its curved back and M logo dimple, I found the opposite.  The thinner sides compared to the thicker back made the phone feel much less secure in my hands.  But I'm 6\"2 with large hands so your mileage may vary.Pros:  Fast delivery.  Arrived in less than 48hrs with SIM card in place and a great easy to remember phone number.  Just turned it on and was ready to go.  Amazon Wireless was great with returns & tech support.  Better & cheaper than Verizon store (my nearby Verizon store charges a re-stocking fee up to $75 -- on a phone that costs only $99 with a plan -- even if you return a phone even during the first 14 days.  Changes the definition of \"no commitment free trial period\").End Result:  settled on the Galaxy S5.  Turns out it too goes direct to camera by \"double shaking\" the phone, and it has same voice command ability by saying \"Ok Google\".  Only difference is you first have to push the mic icon, the phone won't wake up and react to voice command when in sleep mode ... which from my above experience is a plus.Plus better camera, in my hand feels more comfortable and slightly larger screen (tho phone is not that much bigger) makes it easier to push icons/type with my big fingers.  Lastly have 2 other Samsungs & galaxy tablet so am use to Samsung's bloatware, know how to get rid of everything I don't need, so minimal learning curve.

Since I've had this phone for a while now, and I am now equipped to write my review. I wrote one for the Galaxy Nexus(GNex) after that was released since I bought it the day it came out and my review received nearly 200 votes (mostly helpful), so it seems like people found my review useful. I've posted this review for all the different carrier variants since the hardware and software are all the same except for radios.Hardware DesignThe design of this phone is truly one to appreciate. The fact that I was able to customize the look of mine is not the reason I say that. I can say that this phone does not feel like you're holding an iPhone or a Samsung or any other phone for that matter. It does not feel cheaply made (and being made in the US, it isn't!). It had just enough weight and the part on the outside, don't feel like plastic like most Samsung phones. Don't get me wrong, Samsung makes very good phones, but they all feel cheap, but that's my opinion and others feel the same way. I happen to think the Moto X has a premium feel compared to my old GNexThe screen is much more enjoyable than my Gnex was. This is not to say that I didn't like the screen on my GNex because I did, but the colors seem better on the Moto X. Every user will have a different opinion though. Many people like the IPS Retina display on the iPhone and the best comparison to that is the LG G2, which has a great screen. The AMOLED screen on the Moto X is very good for me though.Continuing with the design near the screen, the rounded edges all around the front of the phone actually feel great. What do I mean by that? Since this screen is truly edge to edge, if you find yourself swiping from the edges a lot, you won't feel the sharpness an edge usually feels like.The mic is on the front of the screen and very noticeable, so when using speaker phone and turn the phone face down to have the speaker facing up, it results in the other person hearing an echo. Didn't have that problem with my GNex, but that is probably because the mic was not very visible on the bottom.I do have a gripe about the design of two things though. Perhaps it's because I'm used to have my GNex, but have the volume rocker and the power button on the same side (the right side), feels awkward to me. But Samsung has it correct in my eyes with the volume rocker on the left side and the power button on the right side. The other thing for me is having the micro USB port on the bottom of the phone and the headphone jack on the top. I don't like this part AT ALL. For those that don't have cars that have Bluetooth Streaming, this creates cord clutter. However, there are times where having the headphone jack on the top can be nice. For example, as a runner I take my phone with me on runs and use headphones. Since the cord doesn't need to go to the bottom of the phone that can make that experience better.SoftwareThe first Android phone I had was the Galaxy Nexus. So why do I say that here in this review. Well, I've experienced the software of other android phone through demo units and phones of friends. I don't like skinned versions of Android like what Samsung does to Android on their Galaxy phones. I do truly enjoy the stock Android experience. The Android experience is nearly stock android. There are some small Moto tweaks, but otherwise, it's the experience I enjoy.Active Notifications are truly awesome! Yes, this falls under software. Now what is that? Well instead of a notification light, a portion of the screen turns on when you have a notification, telling you exactly what app the notification is from. You can pick and choose what apps you want to show notifications through this feature. Now you might be wondering is the screen continuously shows this notification until you dismiss it. Well, you can dismiss it if you want to, but you can preview the notification and see if it's an email or a text or whatever app.Now for Touchless control. Some people may find this to be a gimmick, but it's actually not bad. I use it when in the car to make phone calls. That's about it, though occasionally, saying \"OK Google Now, what's the forecast for today\" is easier than launching an app. (call me lazy for that, it's true haha).Battery LifeI have been putting my phone through test of my everyday usage. That includes, streaming music in my car, using Google Maps for traffic conditions to and from work, texting, calling, checking personal and work emails, checking Facebook, taking the occasional picture and then some sports-related stuff too. I would imagine the average user might use their phone as much as I do in a typical day. Now, the verdict...it's very good. I was shocked at how well the battery lasted. I got more than a full day's worth of usage out of it (wake up at 5am to sleep at 10pm). That's 17 hours for me. That means most people should be able to get a full day's worth out of this phone before plugging in before going to sleep. Moto really did a fantastic job of optimizing the software, processor and screen to maximize battery life.CameraTruthfully, I haven't taken enough pictures to give a great assessment of this, but coming from my GNex, this takes far better pictures. The pictures I've taken have been in great lighting conditions and the pictures have come out great. If you want to get a good idea on the performance, you can google reviews. Keep in mind when this phone first came out, the camera wasn't great, but that was due to the camera processing software. They have fixed that. Droid-Life has samples of the before and after. They show that Moto fixed this. It's a 10MP shooter and should be good enough for everyone's every day camera taking needs.OtherThrough moto maker the phone came with Android 4.2.2. I have not upgraded to 4.4 yet becaue from what I've seen in forums, in 4.4, Verizon is able to block tethering for those who still have unlimited data (like me).

I only get around 12-15 hour battery life. Now I don't know the definitions of moderate use, but I probably use it a lot compared to others during the day. I work in a small IT department so the phones always on my desk, I'll use it to research things or as a flash light to during the day and use it to text. I hardly use it to talk and I still am lucky if I get 15 hours of battery life out of it. Now  I suspect it might be because I get poor service and it's always looking for service, but who knows. Right now I'm at 55% battery life and it's only been off charge for 7 hours with hardly any use, the Android OS taking up 38% of the battery life, so maybe it has something to do with the OS, obviously updated to Kit-Kat, but I had the issue before that release.
