(Leaking fruit juice is an entirely different recovery issue than just water.)  I used it in travel around our state, and reception was not a problem, except for very isolated spots not reachable by any form of mobile communications.  So when we had reception problems at home after getting several models of Verizon Samsung, we decided to step back to this one.  So glad we did.The larger battery (with thicker back cover) is well worth the slight increase in thickness.Supplier shipped promptly.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Never again....", "Author": "Debra Russell", "ReviewID": "R1QMP7HMZVSUCT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was not a good phone...I had to replace it after about three weeks.

This thing lasted 3 days before the light burned out. Never again.  I then got smart.  Went to Target and bought a pre paid phone.  You can't use them for the first six months after your purchase with your regular phone line, but after that, if something happens to your other phone, you have an inexpensive replacement.  Have one set aside.
