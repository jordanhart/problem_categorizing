{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrible problems with this \"smart\" phone!", "Author": "MN_Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R2P92E17P41O8N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "While most of the official online reviews I read about the phone are positive, if you look carefully, you will find hundreds of user comments on various sites about people who have the same problem - the phone keeps shutting itself off in the middle of calls, web browsing, or any other activity.  I had the phone for 1 year and it worked perfectly.  Literally one week after the 1-year manufacturer's warranty expired, everything started going wrong.  I tried to resolve this with my carrier, T-Mobile, who sold me the phone and they refuse to do anything since it is beyond the 1-year warranty period.  The phone is hardly usable.  I cannot make phone calls, view email, or browse the web without the phone freezing and/or turning itself off.  I purchased a new battery and that did not help either.  If you get a Dash that works, it will work well.  If you are unlucky and get one that is a \"lemon\", then you will be very disappointed.", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not as good as the reviews say...", "Author": "Taylor \"Trademark Photography\u2122\"", "ReviewID": "RWXMJFDEJSK1W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "All the reviews state what a wonderful phone the Dash is, but there are some problems it has.1. I'm not sure if this is common, but it the silver faceplate on mine came off rather easily. I've fixed it with superglue, but still a possible manufacturer problem.2. The Jogger Bar (a touch sensitive bar on the side of the phone) is nearly invisible to those who didn't know it existed in the first place. This feature can be turned off and that is what I did once I realized how.3. With the text messaging a slip of fingers can cause the type to turn in to Chinese lettering. This happened to me and I spent hours trying to figure out how to fix it the first day I got it. For those of you that have friends and family with this phone and this problem should choose to pop up, all you do is press alt then cap (both in the lower left corner of the keyboard). That changes it back to English or what ever language is set to the device.That's it for the problems, but there are some really nice features I enjoy.1. Texting is set up like chat where you can view previous messages to and from the same person. It really helps after you get in to conversations with 4 or 5 people at a time.2. The screen is very easy to see even outside during the day.3. The back is rubberized and it doesn't slide easily off of dashboards.These are just a few of the Pros and Cons of the HTC Dash.", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Disappointment", "Author": "Randall \"\"old Comic Nerd\"\"", "ReviewID": "R1IJ815WA6QMTK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone after several people recommended it.  I wanted a Windows Mobile Phone with a qwerty keyboard.  At first, it seemed like a good choice.  But soon, the keyboard began to malfunction.  The keys on the left edge (which includes the # button) would not depress correctly.  FYI, this makes retrieving your phone mail almost impossible.  Also, like several users, the phone would occasionally shut down.  And the volume control on the right edge of the phone rarely worked when you wanted, but would always change when you just pick up the phone.  On the bright side, I liked the Windows Mobile features and how easy it worked with my PC.  Not enough to make me like the phone.  Got rid of this brick before my contract was over.  Couldn't deal with the frustration any longer.  Big disappointment.", "Date": "January 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "nice phone for a good price", "Author": "AK", "ReviewID": "R2KAFNM2MPDQ82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it is unlocked phone and is a very basic smartphone.very easy for texting using qwerty keyboard. the curvy shape of the phone is good and feels good holding it compared to a square or a rectangular phone.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "bien", "Author": "Alfredo", "ReviewID": "RBXI3Y502XGTQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "fue un regalo y el due\u00f1o esta muy contento con el celular, es muy funcional, la unica objecion es que el menu del celular no se puede poner en el idioma espa\u00f1ol", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good working horse, really disappointed with its convenience.", "Author": "K.

Having read all possible reviews I bought right away for a total of \"huge\" $5 including shipping 1 new battery + 1 car charger + 1 wall charger on [...]. One less problem.The phone itself works perfectly well but:1. It has less feachures then any regular fiftydollar phone. For example: no timer, or NORMAL alarm (the one installed is just ridiculous), or a stopwatch, or basic games, no notes at all etc.2. Digits are amazingly small and completely invisible even for my petite fingers and perfect eyes.3. All the window's features are just not there. All you have is just indications that they are supposed to be there. I presume I have to spend forever browsing for unknown downloads and to pay fortune to have Windows Word and Excel.4. Loudspeakers are not of the best quality. And many other small inconveniences which could have been easily avoided by the manufactuter.As a regular phone it works well if you get used to ajusting the volume on the side all the time.", "Date": "November 7, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00164Z6L2"}}
