{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works great, I just would have loved to have some more information", "Author": "VICTOR M CARRANZA GONZALEZ", "ReviewID": "R9XPPFA4SODO4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very good product for the price. I did some research before buying, but found nothing useful at the Blu website and other sites were somewhat misleading. In a nutshell, I wanted a dual-SIM, dual-Standby phone, able to receive calls on both lines concurrently. This phone CANNOT do that. If you are talking on line 1, and someone calls you on line 2 (or vice-versa), the second call will be dropped (or forwarded to mailbox, depending on your carrier's policy). I discovered that too late.The phone uses \"normal\" size sim cards, not the \"mini\" like the ones for the iPhones and other newer products.  Also, 3G/HSDPA is available only on SIM1. The SIM2 slot can only do 2G/EDGE.Pros:- The screen looks great. Black looks truly black and every color comes to life. The touch screen responsiveness is great too.- The dual-core processor does an excellent job. Everything runs smoothly.- Has enough RAM to run very demanding applications.- The main camera is very good at 8MP. The front-facing camera works nicely for video-chat.Cons:- No dual-standby- The headphone jack is low-quality. Anything you plug in there feels loose, and because of that, there is some noise at the headphones/speakers/whatever due to rotation/movement of the plug when you move the phone.- Specific accessories are still nonexistent (case, skins, screen protectors). By the way, I bought the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008CNHS2A case and it fits nicely (a little too tight in the beginning but fits well after some use).- The buzzer/loudspeaker is at the BACK of the phone. So, if you put your phone over a soft surface and try to use the speakerphone, the sound you hear will be muffled. That includes the ringer when the phone is in the case.I hope this review helps potential buyers. This is a very good deal for the price. This phone beats the Samsung Galaxy S3 and is much cheaper.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best dual sim phone by far", "Author": "richyboycaldo", "ReviewID": "R1DEL4J9SO0XY3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say that I waited for this phone since it was announced in december.The Good:Screen: The display is better than mi friends Galaxy S III ppi is 316!! almost on par with iphone 5, and the AMOLED display colors are amazing.Speed: I haven't encountered any problems with the phone so far. 1 gb of ram is more than enought for widgets, background running aps and games (I haven't tried any heavy 3D games)Looks: The phone looks and feels great, you can feel the quality, and for a price of 300.00 it can't be beat (with dual sims)Camera: Camera is OK, the led is powerful, but sometimes the pictures looks too white/blu because of the LED, specially on closer pics.The Bad:Battery: If you check your phone and play all the time, your battery will not last a day. its only 1600 so have a charger in handAndroid: It comes with android 4.0 and you CANT upgrade it to 4.1 or 4.2Verdict:This is the best dual sim phone in the Americas market. I have 1 sim on at&t; and another on telcel mexico. the extra 500 mb RAM over the vivo 4.3 are well worth it.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Eat your heart out Samsung!", "Author": "Selena", "ReviewID": "RVMRLNQT915QF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would have given this baby a 5 stars if it wasn't for the battery life. It goes down at an incredible rate and definitely needs to be charged once a day if you're a heavy user.On the flip side this thing is well built, does anything that other smartphones can do, possibly more and it doesn't dry out my wallet.I think the camera images can be a bit better for an 8MP camera but maybe I just havent found the right app yet.Recently installed AVP the game, works fine. This phone ran about every I i threw at it thus far and i'm an appaholic :)UPDATE : 12th July 2013Still going strong. I still hate the battery life of this phone but the performance is outstanding.There isn't a person that I've shown this phone to that wasn't impressed and I'm not just saying that.

I got home at 7:00 pm and I have the 30% or 35%, and if used with video or something else runs faster.I was surprised FM radio sound is excellent and has the option to record broadcasts.The GPS works smoothly, I noticed even that is not lost both signal and other equipment and has met my requirements.So far I have not had problems with google play and applications, as other teams not very popular brands incompatibilities established, all I installed without problems.I tried to get accessories but are not options, especially silicone cases, but this case was http://www.amazon.com/Luxmo-Vertical-Leather-Holster-Carrying/dp/B008FQT28M and fits perfect.In short I think an excellent dual sim option, just as good as the big brands, it's more I decided that when it goes on sale the blu life, buy one to replace this.The Good:* Dual Sim option.* Good resolution camera.* Good response speed.* Android version very clean.* Excellent sound.* Low cost.The bad.* Block incoming calls when you can hotspot.* Low battery life (common to all smartphones).* Lack of third-party accessories or blu.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone for the price", "Author": "Eman", "ReviewID": "R28G1A56MXN65Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The 2 sim chips work fine for me, the only issue if you could call it like that is that there is so few or none custom roms for the cellphone.IF what you want is a phone to use 2 sims then this phone could be the right for you", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great form factor, frustrating to use", "Author": "Patricia Lopez \"lowpex\"", "ReviewID": "R2EN6TN7S1BF2U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have a love/hate relationship with this phone.Good - great price, beautiful look, perfect dimensions for functionality, and of course Android makes it very customisable.Bad:  Battery life, processing time/lags, crashes with audio apps like Stitcher,Unbelievable problems with audio:- The headphones provided are useless for phone calls (the other party can barely hear me) and 3rd party Android headphones don't work either.

That being said - I looked for a good phone and ran across the line of BLU phones.  I immediately liked the look and the specifications of the Vivo 4.65 HD.  I ordered from Amazon and I had it within a couple of days.  I didn't exactly know what to expect with this phone but I was pleasantly surprised.  The phone has a great display and good loud speaker sound.  The battery life is good to me - not excellent but still sufficient for me.  Be aware that it is apparently not upgradable from ICS that comes on the phone but that wasn't a deal breaker for me.  However, the one thing that I did not take into consideration was the lack of accessories for BLU products, especially soft/silicon phone covers.  You don't want to pay for a phone just to drop it and have it broken or damaged.  I started a search for accessories and ended up searching for hours until I finally found what I was looking for.  I found the soft silicon covers for the Vivo 4.65 HD and other accessories too.  I wasn't a 100% sure that the cover would fit but took a chance and it fits perfect.  I have not found any accessories for the Vivo 4.65 HD in the U.S. but found everything I was looking for on China export sites.  Apparently the BLU phones are rebadged as Gionee Phones in China or vise versa.  Do a search for 'Gionee GN878' and you should be able to find what you are looking for.  Here is the website for the cover I purchased:  http://www.aliexpress.com/snapshot/258639030.html - There may be different variations of the Vivo 4.65 HD but I'm not sure.  I say this because I saw some Vivo 4.65 HD's on E-Bay and the back cover where the camera lens is located looked slightly different from mine.  But you should be able to tell by looking at your own phone and comparing it with the photos of the accessories on the import sites as to whether it's the style that you have or not.  Keep in mind that the delivery time is long - it took about 30 days for my silicon cover to arrive.  If you don't like the covers on the website that I provided then just search on Alibaba.com for Gionee GN878 for other accessories because I saw some more covers on there too.  Also, read the minimum quantity order note for the item(s) you are looking at.  The cover I ordered had no minimum order but some of the items I saw had a minimum order of 10 or 20 so you probably want to skip those.  Sorry for the long review here but I had previously seen comments about the lack of accessories for BLU phones (especially covers) and thought that this may help.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Happy With This Phone", "Author": "Lorne \"sterling\"", "ReviewID": "R3P94F69TVP6BN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this for international travel due to the dual sim card.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 that does not have a SIM slot so I needed to find an unlocked phone I could plug international sim cards into.  I researched the Blu models and chose this one because it was the only one I found with the super amoled screen.  I am very happy with this phone!  Legitimately, this phone is every bit as good as my Samsung Galaxy S3.  Aesthetically, it does not look quite as nice until you take into account how vivid the display is.  I tested this against my Samsung and it rendered web pages and You Tube videos faster.  In my quick casual testing this phone is faster than the Galaxy.The only drawbacks are the contacts application, text application and phone dialer are a little more old school looking and plain than something like a Samsung but you get over that quickly, the charger plugging into the top of the phone and the power button being on the left side of the phone are a bit awkward as well.  The battery does drain fairly quickly and is permanently fixed to the phone so cannot be removed and swapped out.  With a fair amount of usage I would think it will have to be charged to make it through the day.Other than the few drawbacks ..this is truly a beautiful phone with the vivid display and is a very well made and quality phone and is an excellent value the $200 price point.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B5XEBT2"}}
