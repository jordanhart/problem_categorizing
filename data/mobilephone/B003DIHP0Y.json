It is by far the best I've ever used.  It has everything you need (GPS, BT, Wireless, camera, video, MP3, etc).  I also have an iPhone and in my opinion, I think the X10 is better.  Is a hassle to have to use the iphone and be tethered to iTunes all the time.  There are already thousands of apps available out there for the Android OS.  The touch screen interface is probably better on the iPhone.  But the user interface and features on the X10 is, in my opinion better.Quite pricey right now.

I had never had a smartphone to that point. I was obviously impressed and thought it was one of the coolest things I had ever seen. I then picked up a friend's iPhone and was in awe of what it could do compared to my phone. I then did some research and discovered I was running Android 1.6 and there was nothing I could do about it unless I hacked into the phone and fixed it myself. I wasn't going to do that as with my luck I would probabaly break the phone. So I left it be and decided while it was still an OK phone, I would deal with the inferior phone. I finally (3 months later) received an update message advising I could update to Android 2.1! I was excited to get the upgrade until I went through the process. The 1st 2 times I tried the upgrade would stop and say I was incompatable. After a lenghthy convesation with support I got it rolling only for the last step to fail. After wanting to throw my phone out the window, I took a few days away from trying and gave it another shot.4th time was a charm. It did everything I was prompted to do and I am now running 2.1 through my X10! I am now extremely satisfied with this phone. It is now running much better and I can't put it down sometimes. APPS are running MUCH better.But now I fear as the technology is racing faster than anyone can keep up with, what happens when I need to move to 2.2? (2.3, 2.4 or the never ending upgrades..)

I got it last year and in the first few months the phone was running smoothly but now it takes about a minute just to open my text messages and it takes 30 seconds just to send a text message! Sometimes my messages don't even open and I get an error so I have to force close it. Everything I try to open is agonizingly slow. I absolutely hate this phone, DO NOT waste your time and money with this, you can find a much better phone. Also, the touch screen isn't exactly like an ipod or iphone. The touch is a bit off and texting, even after a year of having this phone, is still difficult for me. The camera button on my phone doesn't even work so I have to resort to touch screen capture which is probably one of the very few things I liked about the phone. Another thing I liked is the live wallpaper, I have a pinwheel galaxy in motion as my background and it's pretty slick. Those aside, I wish I never got this phone. The battery life is crappy as well. I'd much rather have a sliding keyboard phone now. Please, DO NOT pain yourself with this phone.

I have looked for a solution in the support zone in the SE web site and there is no answer either. So, the only response seems to be the silence. Because of that, I strongly recomend to you to buy a different brand.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's OK", "Author": "Rambo", "ReviewID": "R1A9AWP9GNXMHC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've now owned this phone for several months now through AT&T.; Although the size is good for video and photo viewing, the phone doesn't always perform well.Phone call quality is good, there is no complaint there. The Mediascape and Timescape features are a good addition. Mediascape is where you manage photos and videos you take from your cellphone. From there, you can generally post them right away on social network sites like Google+, Facebook or even on your own Picassa album if you have one. If you're an addict to social networking and like knowing what everybody is doing in their lives, Timescape is a good features to keep you up to date. It displays status updates from Facebook, Twitter, I believe LinkedIn and your text messages and call log activities.There are a few things I do not like about this phone. First, the battery life sucks and I knew that before selecting the phone for my plan, after reading some reviews on here and elsewhere. I however didn't know it was that bad. Without exagerrating, I charge this phone about two-three times a day as if it was on life support. I don't know how other smartphones compare since this was my first one but Sony hopefully has improved battery life on other models. Bottom line, moderate to heavy use will require constant charging. Make sure you have a car charger too.The other thing is when the phone seems overwhelmed with a lot of data and downloaded applications, it will be slow to respond or will perform something you did not ask. If, for example, you open the CNN app, it will bring up Facebook. If you want to send a text message, it brings up CNN, etc. I've had this happen to me on a few occasions but the problem tends to go away when you turn off and turn back on the device or simply wait it out.Finally, the third thing is the camera/video. This feature was supposed to be impressive with this device but it is anything but -- despite the 8.1 megapixel. The camera does not have any flash. Don't be fooled by that \"light\" below the lens. It is not a flash (I don't know why it's there). Pictures/videos are only good when taken in daylight.Overall, this phone is not very good. I give it a three stars because it does have some nice features and allow you to do some stuff quickly (like posting or sending pictures to loved ones instantly). If you don't care about brand loyalty, I would look elsewhere. If you are a Sony fan like myself, I would select another model. I'm probably going to wait for Sony-only branded new phones (without the Ericsson name) to be released next year.Update (January 2012): I've found a way to improve battery life, all thanks to AT&T; and the Sony website. I've reduced the brightness light to the lowest level, deleted apps I don't use much, avoid using widgets or other animated features and, most importantly, installed an app killer and a juice defender. Apparently, it is very useful to install such programs as there can be dozens of apps running even if you close them. The advanced task  killer (free from Android Market) I installed basically closes apps (\"kill\") for you. Since using those two programs, I've seen a lot of improvement. I now generally charge my phone once a day instead of the three times a day I mentioned above. I, however, still believe that the battery life on this phone is definitely not the best out there.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "gd purchase", "Author": "ashishshevale", "ReviewID": "R1V24149TNFHXT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the sony erricson xperia x10 is not a new phone so I wont talk about phone as can be read about it anywhere from gsmarena to xda developerthe only reson I am taking up two star is because before purchase I asked seller info abt the phone like is it rooted what is rom and such but never got replyAlso the one I received was unlocked but originally by att so it have its logo on the backsidethis wasnt mentioned in product descriptionbut phone quality received is gd and I am glad abt My purchase hr", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R1903SYODBBR1J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Este celular esta muy bonito, tuve algun problema inicial para entenderlo, pero una vez superado da muchas facilidades y tiene todas las aplicaciones del sistema android", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone but I have no 3G or 4G access using it.", "Author": "F.

So, got the phone and it was laggy, very much so. Although it has a 1GHz snapdragon processor it runs, maybe because of lack of RAM, worse than it's replacement, a very, very good LG Optimus One (a $200 bargain, for it's quality and how snappy it is, having a 600MHz processor). It was running Android Eclair 2.1, which had serious problems, mostly on responsiveness and it was then updated (will go deeper about this below) to Android Gingerbread 2.3.3, which was a serious improve on performance, but with a great price.2. Very low battery life, about 10 hours of NORMAL usage. Really below expectations.3. After a month of usage (and a heavy getting-to-know experience), the phone stop charging all of a sudden and the microUSB PC connection stopped working. Without a free fall, without a single blow, even inside a really ugly, but really protective Otterbox Commuter Case. Just like that. You can easily google this \"flaw\" to see that I'm not the only one. Anyway, took it to a Sony Ericsson \"authorized\" shop, payed $35, out it went charging again. Perfect, I said. Well, almost, PC connection gone forever. 2 days later, volume buttons and headphone 3.5mm jack not working either. WHAT? A $400 phone? So, took it back and, with faked regret, they said that they had not touched \"that part\" of the phone and would not recognize it. Also, a common flaw. They said a flex replacement was necessary but they did not have it, advised me to order the flex and they would change it. It arrived, after paying $25 (total cost, until then, $460) but they said it doesn't fit or doesn't work so, the hell with them. Took it to another shop, where they soldered some part of the microUSB and it was working again (although the PC connection lost, same fate to the volume buttons and headphone jack). Great, at least it was charging again.4. After a lot of performance bugs, serious lags and stuff, I read that the Gingerbread 2.3.3 update was out. So, hating the moment I decided to purchase this phone, I figured out a way to update it. I had to push the cable that went in the phone to get the software recognize and updated it, and so I did. Result? A throbbing pain on my thumb and a new (that's really a euphemism) phone that I really liked, despite all flaws and trouble. So, played with it all day and when it was time to charge it, connected it and, what a surprise! It doesn't work anymore. Took it to 4 1/2 different service stores, everyone said the phone was in a resting place now. And that was it. I had someone lend me a phone for work use mostly (a really old Nokia), eventually bought a battery charger and started using the X10 for viewing videos and stuff until I was able to sell it.After this long relationship with this phone, I feel obligated to tell you: DO NOT BUY SONY ERICSSON'S CRAP, EVER!
