The IPhone 4 I received and sent back is a fraud.On october 17, I spent more than 2 hours at the Genius Bar of Apple Store at 5th Avenue, New York. They recommended me to do a back up first and come back the other day.The following day, 18, in Apple Store at 14th Street, New York, I spent another 2 hours at the Genius Bar just to know 1) that they couldn't  just replace the phone because it was out of warranty - it expired two years before, one year after it had been bought by its first owner, in June 2010. So if wanted a replacement I'd have to pay US$ 150 for it - which I accepted; and 2) at the very moment of the transaction, the guy who served me at the shop counter noticed something in the iPhone and asked me to wait. He checked the serial number and found that the iPhone was originally a black one - the one I bought was a white one. He couldn't replace it.They didn't have a new iPhone 4 to sell, and I needed desperately to buy a cell phone because I was leaving the next day to Brazil. I bought an iPhone 5C unlocked for $649 + taxes, as you can see in the annexed file. Total: US$ 706.59.If you want to be fair, please deposit the difference of U$ 266,50 (706,59 - 439,98) I had to pay. I wont charge for the four hours of my vacation I wasted at Apple\u2019s counter, neither for the worry and inconvenience I had with your item .I send alrady several emails and I'm still waiting for an answer.
