{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The LG T375 is a budget dual SIM phone that's ultra user-friendly and stylish too!", "Author": "Jeffrey A \"Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "R1H4P3S7CE96VC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG T375 is a dual SIM phone with a 3.2-inch capacitive LCD color display, 2-megapixel camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM radio and multimedia player.This phone has an easy to grip style - with rounded edges and measuring 4.06 x 2.32 inches and just 0.42 inches thick, it fits perfectly in my hand.This  white LG T375 has a nice clean 'iPhone look' but I also like the rich color of the red LG T375Of course, you can play it ultra safe and buy the black LG T375 - the ultimate utilitarian color!SO, WHY BUY A DUAL SIM PHONE?You can operate two phone numbers on one handset - from the same service provider or different service providers.By putting both SIM cards in the LG T375 handset, it's like having two phones in one. (REMEMBER: Both your SIM cards can be on the same network/service provider or on two different networks)The LG T375 allows me to switch networks flawlessly without having to switch my SIM card - and with two different numbers it's easy to keep work and personal calls separated ON ONE HANDSET!PROS:The LG T375 has 50 MB internal storage and a micro SD card slot (up to 16 GB)Capacitive multitouch screen is very responsive128 MB ROM and 64 MB RAM is more than adequate for basic phone functionsThe phones offer GSM/EDGE connectivity along with Wi-Fi. You also get Facebook and Twitter integration (I haven't used these social media features though)According to the Users' Manual, the standard 950mAh Li-Ion battery allows up to 528 hours of Stand-by and up to 14 h 40 min of Stand by time. With normal use, I usually charge my phone every 3 days.Like most phones, you need the headphones Stereo to operate the FM radio but the LG T375 allows FM recording.  I use the FM recorder to make unique ringtones :))Pairing devices using the LG T375 Bluetooth is easy.  So far I have used the Bluetooth to pair the LG T375 with a Sony VAIO E15 Laptop, a Motorola T325 Bluetooth Portable Car Speaker and a Samsung C3222 Ch@t Dual SIM PhoneCONS:The LG T375 is a budget phone so, the processor is understandably slow.The LG T375 connects via EDGE, GPRS - so, slow data means slow Internet browsing.The screen lacks an ambient light sensor for automatic screen brightness adjustment - it's a bit of a challenge to see the display in bright sunlight.The screen display is low resolution (240 x 320 pixels) with a pixel density screen of 125ppi.  This is only noticeable if I am doing a lot of Internet browsing.The camera is just 2.0 MP and it lacks autofocus and also no flash. These is fine if you use the LG T375  phone camera only as your backup camera.My list of cons seem long, but this is quite a user friendly utilitarian DUAL SIM phone with a very responsive capacitive touch screen - great for calls, texts and managing two phone numbers on one handset.  DEFINITELY 4 TO 4.5 STARS!Hope my review was helpful ... Jeffrey A.
