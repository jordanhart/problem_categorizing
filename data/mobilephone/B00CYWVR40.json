{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty good basic flip phone except for MMS problems", "Author": "Rabbit W", "ReviewID": "R10EC1F946RZMA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this to use with PTEL Mobile, on sale so pretty good value. I only need a phone for calls and texting, so cannot comment on the other stuff like web browsing, etc. It looks nicer than my old Virgin Mobile Arc phone and has a nicer ringtone. The manual that iZone includes is barely informative, but you can find one online pretty easily or just dig around in the menus. The only thing I liked better on my old phone compared to this Samsung one is being able to check the time without opening the phone. Reception is not quite as good, but I think that is more an issue with my provider and location. I haven't had dropped calls or anything, but there is one spot in my house where reception disappears. Sound quality of calls is better than any other phones I've owned, but I have owned some really crappy phones, so.. Battery power also seems decent, but again, I'm not a power user. Oh - also, the camera is better too than on my old phones! It's no iPhone, but you can change exposure and zoom really easily which is pretty cool and change settings (night time, outdoor, etc.).Update: Ok, so while I still like this phone, I have discovered a major issue with either the phone or with Platinum Tel cell phone service. I can't send or receive picture texts or group texts! Basically, there's a problem with the MMS service. I have spent a lot time talking with both PTel and Samsung about the problem, but no one seems able to help me. Samsung sent me some unhelpful email about text size limits that is not relevant to me, since my photos are less than 300k. PTel gave me the brush after a series of unhelpful emails with a wide variety of settings to try - they ended my request for help by saying that since I didn't buy the phone from them, they couldn't guarantee it would work. So now I have to decide whether or not I should try a different cell phone service or buy one of PTel's crappy phones. :(", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent little phone", "Author": "Lili", "ReviewID": "R3HYOZ944NPWJ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does what my husband wanted, a flip phone with Bluetooth so he could use it without contract. Takes a fairly decent photo. Battery life is excellent. One week still half charged on first charge. Works with ATT gophone prepaid sim.  Package arrived as stated no box, but neatly bubble wrapped.

The phone was as expected; Black, Simple, Cheap and Sturdy!. For anyone seeking to avoid cute and pretty and service provider controls this phone is a good way to accomplish this. Going online for the manual worked well and setup of service was normal. All in all it is a very sturdy phone with the exception of the lanyard tie point being in the battery cover. I expect one day the thin bar will break or the cover will come off when handled by the lanyard. I have no evaluation of the camera as it is not used. The most important feature is the Bluetooth and that works very well. The second most important feature is the folding cover over the keys.Texting and web service is shut off as this phone is used only to make and receive calls.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CYWVR40"}}
