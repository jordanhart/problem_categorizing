{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone, Exactly the right size, works 2G & 3G in S. America on Movistar, Claro and Tigo. In the U.S. on AT&T;", "Author": "KC", "ReviewID": "R27YSCMXEL242M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 3 1/2\" screen (size of I Phone) was to small, the G3 was to large and the S3-MINI, well a perfect size to read, write and keep in a pants or shirt pocket. Speed is fast in 3G, just DO NOT load your phone up with every app you find or you can experience some major slowing. This is not a 3g Mini issue, this applies to any smart phone on the market.As the title states, this phone WILL work on 3G in South America using MOVISTAR, TIGO or CLARO. I travel there quite a bit and tested this phone on my last trip using each of the three companies Sim chips. The 3G data was transmitted on the 850 band width. Just make sure your phone is the \"L\" model. I have found the 3G speeds to be fine for GPS directions and turn by turn mapping while driving. No phone freezing or lag time.In the U.S, this phone will work in 3G on AT&T;, either a contract or \" Go Phone\". IT WILL NOT WORK WITH T-MOBILE in 3G data. It will work with T-Mobile on their 2G bands.Battery life is good and the screen is bright and clear. Speakers are loud and clear for calls and I have had no problems with the listener being able to understand me. A car charger is a must have if you drive.This phone has the SAMSUNG-DIVE anti theft software installed so you can easily track your phone, lock it or wipe you data in the event it is lost or stolen. This service is FREE since it is a Samsung device. Go to SAMSUNGDIVE.COM to get all the technical info about how this service works.Another thing I like about this phone is NO branded locked in software that you can't remove. No branding so you don't get any carrier start up screens.We purchased three of these phones. One for my wife, one for me and a spare.SWYPE & DRAGON. This is a must have program in my opinion. SWYPE is fast for typing and DRAGON is lightning fast (and accurate) converting speech to text. Great for emails and texting. These programs work great on this phone.Have not found any negatives with this phone yet and don't expect any. For under $300.00 this is a great value, nice feature set. Samsung put just the right amount of apps on this phone that 90% of people will find themselves using. No useless junk ware.I am not a gamer, so I can't speak to gaming on this phone with regards to game speeds or screen freeze.As for as repair work, it is important to know that the major carriers in S. America DO SELL the G3 Mini (i8190L) so in the event you needed a new screen or other service work, they should have the parts and technical data available to work on your phone.Only thing to add would be to get yourself a good screen protector and a case that protects the corners in the event you should drop it.So get it and start enjoying it.

I bought the GT-i8190L, based on the reviews and the fact that it works well in Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe, where I spend a lot of time.  It even works in Afghanistan and Dubai on the Etisalat and Roshan Networks!If I had this phone 3 years ago, I would never have purchased an iPod, because this phone does everything my iPod does in addition to the phone function.  The sound quality is excellent, it plays videos and music seamlessly, the bluetooth function works seamlessly, The Kindle app works, email is awesome, surfing the net is awesome.  The touchscreen response is quick, smooth, and seamless, the facial recognition works, GPS works (even in Afghanistan), FM radio works there too, Camera is superb and there are two of them, it's very user friendly / intuitive, we can all use more battery time right? well this phone will not disappoint and if you turn off functions that you are not using especially GPS for example you would be fine.  I can read Word and PDF docs.  If I had one complaint it would be the ear piece, but with a bluetooth receiver that most of us use anyway...walla!  Oh, did I tell you this phone is UNLOCKED!!!!Yes! Really and Truly unlocked! Will work in Europe, Middle East (Dubai, Afghanistan for sure), Caribbean, Latin America, AT&T;, Verizon, T-Mobile and Walmart SIM cards.Finally, the price is right. That plus all the functionality of this \"bad boy\" I say you cannot go wrong.  I lack nothing with this phone!

It was the version ordered - unlocked i8190L as opposed to i8190 which is the version that will work without a hitch in my section of the world (Jamaica). It was unlocked and brand new as indicated and does not appear to be refurbished. The seller's terms are reasonable and they delivered as advertised. I would go with them again and would recommend them if you are interested in this product.It uses regular sized sim card so you don't have to get yours cut or go out and get a mini one. Frankly unless you have small hands it may not feel very manly. The touchscreen keyboard buttons are small even for a woman's hands, even when you use it landscape. But it you are not flashy and like to keep things simple then this will work for you because it fits well in the pocket. Using the touchscreen keyboard takes some getting used to coming from a qwerty keypad smartphone and some creativity in tapping so as to click the digits you intend.Please read the little instruction booklet that comes with it. You will learn more than you think - like how to answer a call. You can't answer a call by just tapping the green call button. Daisy S. post is very helpful as it relates to bloat ware that you can disable to save on battery usage and also in overall review of the product. If you have prepaid phone service (for buyers in countries like Jamaica) ensure to disable data roaming and data usage when you are not utilizing it otherwise it will eat up your credit. This is easily done - just Google how to do it. Use Wi-Fi instead when you can.It takes good pictures and does good videos.All in all it is a good phone to enter the android platform as a user - there is still much to learn about its features but so far so good; a satisfactory buy.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "I loved my phone", "Author": "Ali V.", "ReviewID": "R2UXQABGG5V041", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is in perfect condition buy it for use in Venezuela and works properly with the operator.
