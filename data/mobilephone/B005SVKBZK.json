Transaction was smooth and received it in a timely manner.  With a bunch of kids I thought it was safer as a mom to have an older model iphone that I could take to the repair shop that wouldn't cost and arm and a leg to fix if something happened. Which in fact did, Two days after I got it I accidentally dropped it and the home button stopped working.  I took it to my local cell phone repair shop and it was fixed and now works great again.  I'm happy with my purchase.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unlocked iPhone 3g from Amazon.com", "Author": "Andy Effiong", "ReviewID": "R2RJVIR85F7GKG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone was very good, but the USB cable and the charging modem were weak. I could not return them because I had already sent them to my wife who is outside the USA.
