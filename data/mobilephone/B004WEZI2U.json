The programs and applications offered are just amazing. my only wish was for more memory internally. the construction is great. Solidly built. If you don't mind the slightly extra weight then this is for you. On my belt, I dont feel it, but it starts to weigh in while holding it. not that this bothers me too much. My real complaint is the playback audio. Not that great. I would need to play with the settings some more to get what I want. WIth headphones no issues.The programs and responsiveness are good. You don't have to wait forever for applications to load up. In this regard it blows many other phones (BB) out of the water. With this phone that is significantly cheaper I dont feel like I am missing an Apple phone at all. yeah - refuse to call it what its real name is!", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beware when buying to make sure your IMEI was not activated!!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"K.Marek\"", "ReviewID": "R2LU6GHXBTDKK3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is not as much a fault of the cellphone as the seller Ross electronics. I bought the cellphone in july 11 2012 and in september it started acting up by not charging corectly. As it was after the 30 day return window with amazon i decided to use my one year warranty via HTC. However when i called them up they said the cellphones IMEI number had been activated as of september 2011. Meaning my Warranty expired in september 2012!!. They basically sold me a one year old USED phone. IT ended up with me returning the phone to amazon in september 3 Months after i purchased it for a full refund. So Amazon really protected me and trusted me with my problem.So buyer beware make sure you contact the seller and verify that the cellphone is new so that you have a solid paper trail, and in case you did end up buying a used phone you can return it without a problem. It also is a very good idea to call the phone manufacturer and make sure the IMEI number is activated when you activate it, so that you know its new!!", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best phone by far!!", "Author": "Just a gyrl", "ReviewID": "R3F1MRZ55QVJM6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for 5 months, and it is by far the best phone I have ever had. I have owned a very many phones over a period of 17 years. Not only did I fall in love with android, but I fell in love with HTC. I was a little leary about getting a phone I knew nothing about, but I trusted my at&t; sales rep and bought it. I have had almost no problems with it. I have way to many pictures and text messages on it and it causes it to freeze up sometimes but not much(which can be expected with so much space taken up). I usually just restart it and it is fine. Every so often I go through and delete things to give it a little bit of a break lol. I have never loved a phone as much as I love this one. I have dropped it on my ceramic tile in my kitchen and bathroom and it didn't even have so much as a scratch on it. I also dropped it on my concrete steps in my garage and again nothing happened to it. I have to say if you are going to get a smart phone (or any phone for that matter) this is the one to get. It has an 8MP camera which is awesome and the color is so vibrant I can hardly stand looking or using anyone else's phone. I have to say this phone has me spoiled. When it comes time to upgrade I will get another HTC phone. Also if you lose your phone you can download an app called android lost from your computer to your phone. It will send you the last messages sent and received, phone calls, take a picture from your phone, send crazy loud \"help me I'm lost\" messages (the phone can be on silent and it still plays it loud), you can set the phone to lock up and notify you if a different sim card is inserted, and many more great things to find your phone. On top of all those things it gives you a gps location within 7 meters of where your phone is. Trust me it works. My phone was stolen and I used this app and it had an arrow directly on the house where the phone was. All of this is emailed to you and the person with your phone has no idea any of this is going on. Awesome phone I highly recommend it to everyone!!! If I could give it 20 stars I would.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent cell phone", "Author": "Jose Sanchez", "ReviewID": "R37DBC4XMMWQIO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent cell phone, the only thing bad is the battery life, otherwise it's super quick and easy to handle ...", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware - Item NOT new!", "Author": "***DM***", "ReviewID": "RMVRFP0T0KVO1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Item listed as New and sold by Jet Set Market and fulfilled by Amazon. Item arrived in an AT&T; box as expected. However, the phone itself is far from new. I am dissapointed that Amazon just chooses to do business with anyone. I choose this particular seller though the order was fulfilled by Amazon thinking that if anything it must be a good seller if Amazon fulfills their orders. There is a sticker on the outside of the AT&T; box that lists IMEI number, serial number etc. I noticed right out of the box that the phone had visual damage to the front speaker part that is at the very top part of the phone. It it bent. Next I turned the phone over and saw that the \"label-cover\" that is screwed on to the inside of the phone (the labels containing the IMEI number, serial number etc where you insert your battery) was coming undone. Up close you can clearly see that the cover has been tamered with and see that the inside screws have been unscrewed before. Now granted, the phone is unlocked so I am fully aware that the seller had to insert a battery, power the phone up in order to unlock the phone, but there is no need to remove the INTERNAL battery cover, that is the battery cover on the inside of the phone not the outside battery lid/cover, unless someone replaced a part on the inside of the phone. As per another buyer's review who had contacted HTC for a warranty issue and then discovered that his phone had an IMEI number that had already been registed, I called HTC to check on the phone I had infront of me when I noticed that the phone I orderd has a serial number on the inside of the phone that is different than the one listed on the box. The box label and the phone label have the same IMEI number but the serial numbers are different. The HTC rep told me that this can be due to the fact that the \"motherboard\" of the phone could have been replaced. In such cases, they use the same IMEI number but serial number can change. In anycase, not only is the phone visible damaged on the front speaker, but also tampered with in the inside as well as serial numbers not matching. I contacted Amazon who issued a refund immediately and send me a prepaid return label. Needless to say, they offered to send me a new phone however just a few days after ordering my phone which was sold by Jet Set Markets (also listed as Samina Ladha) today Amazon is fulfulling the order sold by Ross Cellular. Ross Cellular was the seller who sold the phone with an already registered IMEI number to the other buyer I read a review by. I decided to take my refund and shop elsewhere. I am dissapointed in the sellers Amazon chooses to do business with but thankful that they refunded me promptly.Update: 11/15/12 . . . I kept my eyes on this listing and I noticed in the span of only a couple of days Amazon changes their sellers that they fulfill their orders from.  Their computer system must randomly pick sellers they have an agreement with.  Exact same phone and listing but new sellers every other day.  Having said that, my experience is based on the seller Jet Set Markets (also comes up under name Samina Ladha).  As a buyer who reads a negative review/experience look for the name of the seller, if listed in the review, as this will make a big difference in your buying experience.  There are plenty of reviews on this site from happy customers.  I just wish they would have listed who they actually bought from.  I based my own buying decision on the positive reviews thinking it was the same seller as listed in the advertisement only to discover they change every so often.  My advise, read through the reivews especially the negative ones and see if a seller's name is listed and stay clear from that particular seller.  If another seller is listed under the phone you are buying that day, then make your decisions accordingly.  Good Luck!If Amazon approves, I uploaded two photograph of the phone to go with my reivew.

Phone is very responsive, with almost zero lag switching between screens and loading apps. So far I'm liking everything about this phone (coming from Nokia E71).  My download speeds, as checked on speedtest are over 5mbps, faster than my home DSL!  Screen size is nice, being slightly wider than other phones I've owned, makes watching movies and reading web pages nice. I ordered the Case-Mate case and really like it, also the Zagg screen protector which is very good and easy to install without air bubbles. Wanted to note that battery life out of the box was not that great as with many touch screen phones, but if you can limit the amount of background apps running, turn down the display brightness a little, and have the lock timeout set at 30 seconds to 1 minute, battery life can improve quite a bit. I use a battery saving app called \"Juice Defender\"  it will shut down apps and automatically adjust settings for the best battery life. I have no problem with the phone running all day during normal use, but if used heavily playing games or watching movies a car charger is a good idea.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not an Unlocked phone - AT&T; Branded", "Author": "Dogula", "ReviewID": "RIMLQ4RVMJ7G1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Does not work on T-mobile network as advertised.

Both of the phones which were shipped to me were shipped in tattered boxes and you could tell they had been sitting in filthy conditions. They both were in AT&T; boxes, but they each had problems. The fancy looking paperwork that is one of the images is non-existent. You get the HTC Inspire, Lithium Ion Battery, AC Charger, Micro-USB sync cable and a Quickstart Guide. No 8GB MicroSD card even though the boxes list them as part of the contents. NEW? Not possible if they don't come with an SD Card. I uploaded my own customer photos to go along with this review. Please click on the Customer Uploaded photos to view my pictures.The first seller I will review is iCellPhones. This order was fulfilled by Amazon, which is the only way I would ever purchase an item that reaches the $200 mark. The phone was shipped and came in on time. When I received the box, I immediately noticed that it didn't look shiny like the photos that were uploaded by sayed mohammed. The box was dull, and was taped haphazardly. On the outside of the box was a listing of the package contents. As I opened the box, I noticed everything there except the 8GB MicroSD card. Every item was sealed in the package and I began to get everything in order so that my son could receive a fully charged and operation phone on Christmas Day. I noticed immediately that the micro USB sync cable was a generic one, and although it worked, I was a bit perturbed that I paid a \"NEW\" phone price and received generic and missing contents. (See customer uploaded photos for proof) Unfortunately, the phone never worked properly. I couldn't get a signal anywhere in my house, 9 times out of 10 I would dial a number and it would immediately hang up. I began browsing forums and found that some Inspires had terrible reception and the only way to fix it was to solder wires, or dial *#*#4636#*#* and change from WCDMA preferred to GSM only or blah blah. I also noticed that the SIM cover doubled as an antenna and the 'gold' contacts for the antenna actually looked as though they had peeled completely off. (I uploaded photos for proof of this as well) Instead of trying to void the phone, and by the time I fully tested it, it was too late and I had to order another phone on Amazon on December 24th for next day delivery. Unfortunately, I couldn't just exchange the phone because Amazon fulfilled the order, but it was sold through iCellPhones...there was no option, so I had to fork out another $229 for another phone before receiving the refund on this phone.The second seller I will review is BytesofDeals. Again, Amazon came through flawlessly. I've never had an issue with their fulfillment and although this phone was sold by BytesofDeals, it was fulfilled by Amazon...PEACE OF MIND!. The phone would arrive on December 26th. The box for this phone was in much better shape. I thought I had a winner, but my hopes were soon dashed when I opened the box and found again...no 8GB MicroSD card and this time...the battery was in worse than used shape, it was completely abused. (See customer images for proof) Luckily I still had the battery from the previous seller and had not sent the other phone back and I was able to take comparative photos for this review. Unfortunately for my son, this phone had the same issues as the last one. Super Low to non-existent reception. I am comparing this phone's reception to a Samsung Galaxy SIII, an iPhone 4S, iPhone 5 and a Motorola Bravo (his old phone). All of these phones are owned by us on the same AT&T; phone plan. They can all make calls that this HTC Inspire 4G fails on every time. Just google Inspire 4G reception problems and you will see what I am talking about. I ended up taking this second phone to AT&T; and having them set me up again with a new SIM card. It was of no help. Same issues. I gave up and am returning both phones as I type this.As a side note, I can't prove it, but it appears to me that these phones are refurbished. When comparing the two phones side by side, I noticed that one of the phones has a void sticker over one screw underneath the side cover. Both of the other exposed screws are silver. On the other phone, there are no \"void\" stickers on any of the screws and the sticker that has the IMEI number appears to have been removed at one time. There is one black screw and 2 silver screws. These appear to be amateur refurb jobs.I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone. Even with Amazon fulfilling the orders, you'll still be out money. I am so thankful that Amazon will refund the money but I have to drive to UPS, ship these back with the pre-printed shipping labels and then wait for them to receive them.

What a colossal waste of money and time that turned out to be...I work a few physically demanding jobs, so I picked up an Otterbox to protect the phone from the usual pocket \"bumps\" and \"bangs\". I also bought a few decent screen protectors and had them put on by a pro (basically some nerd with a squeegee). All these protective measures were pointless because I babied the phone anyhow, but it never hurts to be cautious.I had the phone for about six-months when one night I put it on the charger (as was my habit after using it throughout the day and draining a portion of the battery) only to have it not power-on the next morning. It would vibrate and that was all. The phone wouldn't respond to hard reset, battery removal or any of the dozens of online fix suggestions. No broken seals, no water damage, no tampering... just dead.So frustrated but not defeated, I called HTC customer service and requested a fix or new phone to replace my broken one (still believing a \"warranty\" was an honored contract) only to receive a whole heaping pile of neither. My unsympathetic phone-technician claimed the vibration code was an \"unspecified hardware failure\" and since it was \"unspecified\" that fell beyond the bounds of my normal AND extended warranties. Guess I should have checked page #537 of the warranties' legal babble fine print before purchasing, huh?Needless to say I will NEVER do any sort of business with HTC again!

The phone loads apps very quickly, with virtually no lag. The 4.3 inch screen is quite nice to look at, and very responsive to touch. However, if I have one complaint about the phone, it would be the external speaker. For some reason, it just isn't loud enough on maximum, and the sound seems to come out of the rear speaker more than the front (this can be annoying when you're trying to watch a YouTube video, for example). Another downside of this speaker issue is that you may not hear the phone ring or make a notification sound if you have it on your bed or some other surface where the back speaker could be muffled. I guess you could solve this by putting the phone face down. However, phone call quality/loudness is excellent - I only have an issue with external volume.I would also recommend using the Handcent SMS app for text messaging rather than the stock text messaging app that comes with this phone; the stock one has the propensity for removing the names of the people you're texting, so you would only see their phone number and you might lose track of who you're actually texting with. That's pretty annoying, and Handcent doesn't do that (plus it looks a lot better - very reminiscent of the iPhone's text messaging format). You can download this for free from the Android Market on your phone.And one note about the video camera - I've seen several video recording tests from this phone on YouTube where the sound quality is absolute crap. But I can assure you that when I tested out the video recording on mine, the sound quality was actually good and normal. Overall I'm enjoying this phone a lot - it's definitely not a small device to hold, and it might seem a bit heavy at first, but you get used to these things because it is a really high-quality device. That's why, despite my complaint about the speaker, I give it 5 stars (though I'd give it 4 and a half if it were allowed - I really do not understand why this phone couldn't have had a better external speaker).", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R15TTJXUTBD9HO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was using a Google G1 that I generally liked but found a bit slow and that rebooted fairly often.

The iPhone screen is better but only that, others have more RAM but only that, others have more CPU speed but just that, this one is a bit lower than the tops but has everything put together. high speed, high RAM, the screen looks great, the GPS locks on fast and it's very precise, it's aluminum body makes it hard enough to take some falls and the gorilla display will assure you a safe screen. Battery sucks but, every high end cell phone I've seen drain batteries so.. just accept it and get a few extra batteries with you or a travel charger.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Customer service is very responding.They corrected the error immediately.", "Author": "Janet Chang", "ReviewID": "RGJWNTBZJB3ZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Customer service is very responding.

Housing is ridid and solid feeling. Carefully correcly slide battery and sims cover for a good feeling fit. Quick crisp function with sharp attractive lcd display. HD 720 video cam turns out astonishing videos with good 30fps style shootee movements. Better than previous n95 fair bit so. Smooth small pixel video for a phone cam. Multi adjustment 8mp camera that shoots like good hd dedicated camera photos. You might spend time on tethering to download video, etc. to computer. Only way for now is to download HTC's Sync software which has the phones drivers to show up on storage device list in my computer under your C: drive. You got to have correct phone drivers first as stand alone or part of a software like HTC Sync which is free. Looks like not sure because went through many try ways and forgot but HTC Desire HD drivers and software is compatable. It's sad though when a higher tech electronic device has everything to work but can't get it to work when it can with correct procedures. Sometimes it's technically hard even as per intruction follow basis. You have to have some pan experience or some infrastructure fundamental understanding. This Android OS version is appealing and the ROM BIOS company difference is good and entertaining. GPS works good with offline maps and POI's. Do not need data connection nor wifi to use just like dedicate GPS for cars. Free or a few bucks for map software. This phone looks big with big lcd touch screen. I heard it had an aluminum alloy back chassis. Looks corporate sophisticated. Charges quick with full battery when so information when off charging. The cameras are very super and in HD with GPS navigation.After time spent with HTC, I still like and still has new buy value. The video is truly good and even in nightclub lights if you adjust the exposure to full - and get good light movement in video. Gps is good long as use quick lock on software and can be use with offline stored maps and poi's with no wifi nor mobile data required. Vast market of android software. Choose the best for your phone type. As for any new beta type android phone problems, I encountered a boot loop problem which recycles partial restarts. It's not too much of a problem for due to expertise in fixing most anything unless true terminal. Systematically got it linear function again with fewer software installed and correct system config. How long last - don't know but seems to fix easy on the fly on the spot. Kept factory HTC ROM way. Aside from the boot loop occasional problems the phone is still fine and like to use. Evidently as one reason do take care the sd card procedure as it seems important to cut on better function. The read and link of data from the sd seem to require exact correct procedure or hyperthread error and boot loop crash. Multiple installs and from backup may not sure of apps may corrupt in natural eventually. May experiment with force stop on certain running apps may work to test. Correct sd procedure seems to work for me and a complete erase and redo reset - full clean job.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Jacqueline Hale \"Retired to the Sierra mountains\"", "ReviewID": "R3596GAXKL80JQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an HTC Incredible2 with my cell phone compamny but it wouldn't work with Consumer Cellular whose programs better suits my limited needs for a cell phone.

For the wifi calling, I personally can live without it, but there are apps out there that will let you make calls through your wifi.

So I decided to buy this one online (unlocked) and see how it goes.I must say this phone has worked wonders with me. I went from the original 2.2 firmware to 2.3 and then 4.0 (upgrading via root) and it has worked for me everytime.It does have the usual smartphone battery issues but that something that happens to every phone so I don't really mind. With internet (WiFi or 3G/4G) enabled it lasts for a day or so, and it takes like an hour or two of charge.The phone is very fast and responsive even though I have never used it for playing games but I have a lot of applications installes and they all run very smoothly.Had no problems with the delivery either so I'm very satisfied overall.I reccomend this to anybody who wants a fast yet not so expensive smartphone.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "its  a  4 star.", "Author": "Fernando Aguiar.", "ReviewID": "R1V77IPFH5ITR9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "its a good phone i love  love the phone  camera its nice.love the gps  and its so fast its so good.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Jesse", "ReviewID": "R1EOKYVRFW2D29", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i like the phone and it has many wonderful options. the only problem that i had was you can not do any of the update on a mac so beware and as i found out later it that way for all HTC and android phones", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone is fine.

They claimed they gave Amazon a wrong e-mail address and didn't receive it.  Amazon had copied me on the e-mail so I resent it using yet another e-mail address.  Again, they told me that information was not good and informed me that buying from Amazon was the same as buying off Craigs List or Ebay and that they would not warranty or fix my phone.  They told me this phone was manufactured for Indonesia - not the United States and that this phone was over 3 years old and now obsolete..  Hmm, this was after numerous phone calls to them with over 8 different representatives from HTC.  First I was told that this was a common problem and all I needed was a sim card tray.  Then I was told that was not correct, there is no sim card tray for this phone and they would not discuss anything until the warranty issue was resolved.  After numerous calls, they finally told me the phone was not meant to work in the United States and that Amazon does not use authorized retailers of their product and compared Amazon to Craigs List and Ebay.
