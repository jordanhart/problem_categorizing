{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Refurbished", "Author": "Alex C. Perris", "ReviewID": "R1MQLA7TQGONKR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although this item was refurbished, it was indistinguishable from new. It had a sealed battery, owners manual, and charger. The only clue that it might be a refurb was that the plastic film covering the screen of most new phones was missing.On to the phone:  It gets great signals and sound reproduction is crisp and natural. I found the bluetooth easy to connect, and liked most of the phone features. All the Tracfone models with a letter \"C\" at the end run on the Verizon network or Sprint both of which are CDMA. I have heard some people that tried to get a CDMA phone had trouble activating it. I purchased this from Amazon and had no trouble activating. A search of Tracfone's website using my own zipcode does not yield any models ending in \"C\" . I was having trouble with my ATT service on Tracfone and wanted to try a Verizon service phone. This one works great in my area. I am very happy with it.A few of my complaints follow:  1) The phone directory has space for multiple phone numbers within an entry and email, but not physical address.  2) Browser is extremely cumbersome, to the point you will never want to use it. The button to activate the browser is in a place where you will activate it every day, thus losing some of your minutes to a fairly useless browser. As far as I can see there is no way to deactivate the button or repurpose it.  3) Wifi use is not available on this handset.  4) Security. I searched the Samsung website and downloaded a manual for this phone. After reading for an hour, I could not find the pincode to reassign my own pincode. I started worrying that as a refurb it might have someone else's code and I will never be able to unlock and use security. Finally I went to the Tracfone website and poured over their information. The pincode to activate security on your phone is the four digit combination of the last four digits of your phone number. You enter those last four digits and you can reassign security numbers of your own.", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "good enough", "Author": "gijobarts", "ReviewID": "R23QBRSHOAW0AI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phone works well. The USB/charging cable it came with didn't work, but they're cheap and I had another one.When I transferred my service from my previous Tracfone, the phone kept saying \"0 Service Days Left\", but it kept working anyway. The next time I added airtime, the website said that it detected a problem with the phone and I needed to punch in a *lot* of numbers to \"reprogram\" it. After that, the phone restarted and started showing service days and airtime amount like normal, and I was able to add airtime without any more fuss. I don't know if that was because it was a refurbished phone, or a hiccup in the service transfer system. Either way, it's working now.The phone doesn't have double or triple minutes. You can get the same model with triple minutes over here: http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Prepaid-Triple-Minutes-Tracfone/dp/B00AI94YMI/ .BTW, before I transferred the service, I tried to use the phone and got a message from Verizon saying that the phone wasn't set up. After I set it up, a message sent via Verizon's email to SMS system got to the phone. This really is on Verizon's network.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just awful", "Author": "John Jay Junior", "ReviewID": "R8602YKWEF20P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received my phone in the mail today. It came in a brand new box sealed and wrapped... The battery and everything else was sealed as well. The only indication that the phone had been used was that it already had a phone number. After calling customer service several times and speaking to a manager I was unable to get the phone switched to my area code? I don't know if this phone was stolen or what but this was an awful experience. I will never buy from a marketplace seller again. I will be sticking just to sold and shipped by Amazon from here on out.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "TRACFONE FACTORY REFURBISHED!\n1 YEAR TRACFONE FACTORY LIMITED WARRANTY!\nPackage includes: Samsung S380C Tracfone (Black color), Samsung Battery, Samsung Battery Door, Samsung Home Charger, Samsung USB Cable, Tracfone Activation Card, and Tracfone User Guide\nUses Verizon Towers for best service", "Name": "Samsung S380c Tracfone QWERTY Keyboard Smartphone Cell Phone Uses Verizon Towers", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eSs%2BpZS1L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EJVQ6D6"}}
