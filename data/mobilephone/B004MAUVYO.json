So if you are looking for a phone with  WiFi or  iOS or Droid etc, then continue shopping!WHY A DUAL SIM PHONE?With two sim cards in one handset, it's like having two phones in one.  Both sim cards can be on the same network/service provider or on two different networks.PROS:The Samsung Ch@t C322 has long battery life - much  longer than the Motorola.You can save data on the phone memory or, if you have lots of music etc to save, you can add a micro SD card (up to 8GB).The phone is easy to setup and use - simply press the sim switch at the right of the phone and you've switched networks for outgoing calls.At a glance you can see what network sim is currently your default for outgoing calls - the Samsung Ch@t C322 allows each sim/network to be customized with its own ringtone, wallpaper and color theme.The QWERTY keyboard has tiny buttons but, it's still great for texting.If you have several Samsung phones nearby, turn on the Bluetooth and you can send messages to the other phones via Bluetooth and no network charges :))You can activate a fake call feature by pressing a discreet switch on the phone. Your phone 'calls you'! I love knowing that this fun feature exists! :))CONS:The screen is small, the keyboard buttons tiny, the camera is 1.3MP - but remember, this is a budget phone! You won't be disappointed if you are looking for a simple to use and affordably priced dual sim phone.The speakerphone is much too soft so, you'll need to use (the supplied) headset at the ballgame.With the Auto lock on, the keyboard locks up too quickly - this can be annoying.I give the Samsung Ch@t C322 phone 4 STARS - It is overall a great buy.Hope my review was helpful ...Jeffrey A.

It served its purpose very well as i wanted a simple and economical phone. Didn't want a phone that would put my life at risk because someone wanted to steal it.Pros:Ease of use. Arrived on time. Dual Sim is really cool and easy to switch networks. Quad band is seamless. FM music stations are very clear. Data/music is enhanced when you add a memory card.Con:Keyboard is very small and could be a challenge for someone with normal or large hands. Instructions were very limited.

Simmer", "ReviewID": "R3IMFDER2I2WLG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this phone for most (modern) basic cell phone usage.  I make and receive calls.  I send and receive texts.  I take pictures.  I take notes (shopping list, lyrics I hear, and little things like that).  I play games.I got this dual SIM phone because I live in Guatemala where all phones use SIM chips and there are three companies to choose from.  I can tell you that this phone works well with TIGO and Claro.  I have not yet tried it with Movistar, but I probably will soon.  The biggest problem I have had concerning the phone features is trying to get it to work with the internet.  In my opinion, it is NOT an internet friendly phone.  For me, this isn't an issue as I use an air card with my laptop and much prefer to using internet on a phone.  Also, replacing one SIM chip makes the other one \"reset.\"  If you had set up an internet connection on one chip, you'll have to re-set it up even if you never removed it from the phone.  All your call logs will be eliminated for both chips even if you only changed one.  (These may actually be related to removing the battery, not a chip.)But for me personally, the biggest problem is really not being able to find the charger.  The battery on this phone is so good that I can go a week (or sometimes more) without charging it.  Do note that the keys will not be backlit if trying to use this phone once it has reached \"low battery\" making it nearly impossible to use at night or in a dark place.  Don't let it get to \"low battery\" if you can avoid it.  The phone will force you to basic functionality of phone calls and texts only.  The camera won't work nor will games.If I were in the market for another phone, I would probably choose this one again.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the mouse on this phone", "Author": "Kasor2175", "ReviewID": "RBWDZEGN2GO65", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am older so I wanted a phone that is easy to use.

Depending where he's at he decides which SIM to use all in the same phone :) .The only two problems that he has is that the Spanish language on the phone is not translated properly and its completely confusing.
