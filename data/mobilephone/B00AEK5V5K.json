{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice phone with limitations for US T-Mobile users", "Author": "Paul S. Remington", "ReviewID": "R2I5LKHD8AUZ2Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Samsung S3 Mini is a lite version of the Samsung S3 smartphone.  It sports a smaller 4\u201d screen with a resolution of 480x800 and is an entry-level phone compared to the more pricy and feature-packed S3.  This phone does not support 4G, which is curious since the S3 does.  It supports 2G and 3G, as long as it works well with your carrier.And this is the part of the review where I state a friendly warning.  The vendor selling this phone states the phone is compatible with GSM carriers, such as AT&T; and T-Mobile.  This may not be entirely true.I purchased this phone while setting up service with T-Mobile here in the US.  I wanted an unlocked phone that my wife could use with our new service.  The vendor sent us a Samsung S3 Mini \u201cOrange\u201d phone that originated in Europe and had European firmware installed on it.  While the phone worked fine and upgraded itself properly, we were never able to get any speeds more than 2G with a data speed of about 100Kbps, which is painfully slow.  The smartphone was unable to host any smooth streaming media due to this slow bandwidth.I then learned that the phone does not support the US T-Mobile 3G transmission frequencies.  It will work with T-Mobile, but only at 2G speeds.  If you live in the US and plan to use this phone with T-Mobile as your carrier, expect only to use 2G service.  This may be fine for some people.  If it is, this phone is worth considering.The charger is an international charger that comes with a North American adapter.  The phone comes with a pair of headphones and a battery.  It does not come with an SD card, case, or protective cover, as is typical with cell phones in general.We were able to return the phone and get our money back from Amazon.  Amazon is very good about returns.  While this phone didn\u2019t work for us and it was advertised to work with AT&T; and T-Mobile, in fairness to the vendor who sold it, they also do say that \u201cnot all carrier features may be supported.\u201d  You're best to take this into consideration before purchasing this phone.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT", "Author": "DC", "ReviewID": "R2VJQ1E2T598IQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS EXCELLENT CELL USE IT COMES IN VENEZUELA MODE UNLOCKED CAMERA VERY FAST AND SUPER GOOD IS BROUGHT ALL THE ACCESSORIES EXCELLENT MENSIONA", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Handy and powerfull", "Author": "Inti", "ReviewID": "R2J4ACTMDPVZS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone with android 4.0 is awesome.

The phone works really well on a T-mobile network.  No speed issues so far.  Call quality is great.  I just wish the speaker phone were louder.EDIT:  I have to change my review to 1 star.  I received my phone around May 5.  By May 15 (10 days later), it was dead.  As in, Sudden Death Syndrome that the Galaxy S3's are notorious for.  It's a shame.  I really loved this phone.  It never got wet or dropped.  I was in the middle of texting when it cut off.  I'm a pretty technical person who does a lot of diy repairs successfully, so I do a lot of troubleshooting and research before throwing in the towel.  I didn't think it was the battery since it still had some power left, but I tried to charge it anyway overnight.  It did not even charge.  Couldn't do a thing; not even do a hard reboot or any of the other tricks I read.  It would not even turn on.  I highly doubt it was a bad battery, either, judging from what I've read about sudden death syndrome.The repair for this kind of damage would be to replace the mainboard (motherboard), and even then, if that new mainboard uses the same defective chip, the same thing will happen.  So I decided it was not financially worth it to invest in its repair.I still love Samsung and stand by their products overall.  This is the first time I've had issue with their products.  Just be aware that if you're in the U.S., you will get little to no support from our U.S. tech support if it crashes.  You can not send this to a U.S. repair place. It will have to go to a UK repair place, at your risk and expense.  Always a risk with buying international phones.  But I've had good luck with my other unlocked european phone -- the Samsung Galaxy i5500 Corby.  Had it for the last 2 years, and I'm still using it for our other cell phone line that stays home.  Besides it being slow (which was expected, as it was a cheap smartphone), it never caused problems.That said, I sucked it up and went for the Samsung Galaxy S5 from my carrier.  At least if the same thing happens, I will have full support.
