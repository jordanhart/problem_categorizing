The color is a little brighter than expected, more of a metallic magenta, but I'm satisfied with it.  I set up a pay-as-you-go service plan with T-Mobile and had no problems getting started.  The phone requires a regular SIM card (not nano or micro), and if you get a SIM card from T-Mobile, you can then go to their website and activate your account, where you choose what type of plan you want.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blackberry are always nice to have", "Author": "Natalie Highsmith", "ReviewID": "R2WWN63C7EHSH5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a blackberry.
