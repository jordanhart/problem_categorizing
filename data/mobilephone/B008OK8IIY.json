{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Previously Damaged Phone? Perhaps Refurbished.", "Author": "Nabil Yazdani", "ReviewID": "R39XLQOUVCQGVX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this item through Amazon Prime from a company called \"Breed\" and it is not authentic. The sticker on the inside of the phone is something printed on a home printer (with poor print quality).I called Samsung customer service and the IMEI number was a legitimate one (the phone was made 11 months ago) but it was mysteriously out of warranty already.  Next, I called AT&T; and told them I had bought this new phone and would they be able to accept it. They looked up the IMEI number and it turns out that the phone had been through their liquidation department. The rep explained that this meant that the phone had been returned and it was considered defective. This explains why the phone no longer carries the 1-year warranty.I called Amazon customer support and they will give me a refund but they seemed very relaxed about the whole thing. They will not report this back to \"Breed\".  I am outraged! I paid almost four hundred dollars and got a knock off or, at best, a refurb.  I had stayed away from e-Bay because I did not want to get a phone that was not authentic. I put my trust in the Amazon Prime program. This phone was warehoused and shipped by Amazon on behalf of \"Breed\" which is a business name for a company called \"Unlocked Cell Phone Kings Inc.\"I am so disappointed that Amazon Prime is not a brand that can be trusted any more.

Netflix and Skype work very smoothly. Still a fan of Samsung's Swype keyboard, very accurate and it works great with a large screen space. I appreciate the Assistive Light widget, too. Still a few features I've yet to explore.Cons: Battery tends to run out quickly even though I'm actively using it about 3-4 hours a day. My usage is primarily from the display and browser/bandwidth hogging apps.Other comments: The thing about finding this particular item with this specific description (my original search was just for an unlocked Galaxy sIII) is the Amazon results only come up with one at any given time. The price seems to drop each day, and there's always a different vendor. Mine was \"Art Lobby\" - no major complaints, phone arrived on time, intact, mint condition. However, I found it strange that it was an AT&T; phone with AT&T; logo on the back cover of the phone and loaded with AT&T; bloatware. After doing some research, I understand that the I747 model was sold by AT&T;, so that makes sense.I also understand that while there's the \"Galaxy sIII\" there are different variations of the same phone, each with its own model number. The Wikipedia page describes the models and their differences in detail here: [...]Also, with some Samsung phones, be aware of the differences between the \"full\" models and the \"mini\" models. They're not the same phones, and this difference is poorly advertised by the company and a few carriers.What I learned/what I did: Do the research, deflate your mobile bill. My experience to look for an unlocked phone was driven by years of buying an overpriced, marked-up phone from my carrier whenever I changed my plan. Something to consider when buying an unlocked phone - make sure your phone and a particular model (see above on that I747 business) are compatible with your carrier. I did a ton of research before I made this purchase, and even as the price seems to drop every day, it was still worth paying $360 or so (just phone mind you, the talk/text & data plan with the carrier is separate) than $600+ over two years with my carrier for a phone that's been out for over a year. And that $600 is the phone only; when you do that, you either pay in full or pay so much down, followed by the 2 year monthly payments. Wish I had done this years ago - would've saved on my first smartphone and likely the phones before that back to 2003.A caveat here on the AT&T; bloatware - I'm a tech, and rooted (i.e., gave myself administrator-level access) my phone in about 5 minutes as soon as I took it out of the box. It took a good 30 minutes overall to find and remove the bloatware, since I preferred not to do a full install of Android and further risk bricking my phone.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "gs3", "Author": "dewkiss", "ReviewID": "R18SX5727OMQL7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "said it was new...it was not. but. it was fine for the price. not sure I'd get anything from blutek again though", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "The OEM battery is dead after 6 weeks of light use", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R3KHXTCQD6JOQW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It's 6 weeks after I got the phone and the battery is dying in front of my eyes, this is an OEM battery about 6 weeks old.

Downloaded Google's speech recognition and language translation Android software to the phone and it works real time and nearly flawlessly. These are very cpu-intensive, and they work very well. Extremely impressive.LTE works well... even on T-mo's network. This was a pleasant surprise, when you can find T-mo LTE.Love the 16 GB internal flash, external flash (for lots of tunes, in my case), and 2G ram (I have never gotten any \"memory exceeded\" error messages). Most S3s have only 1G of RAM. This special AT&T; version has 2G. Big difference.Great deal at under $350 for an unlocked phone.Gets a 4 instead of 5 due to ...1) short battery life (hint, shut off the GPS, Bluetooth, and WiFi when not needed - GPS is especially a power hog).2) no UMTS 1700 band (one of T-mo's bands). Still works ok on T-mo, but I am often on Edge rather than HSPA. Edge is really slow.  Probably have to get a phone from T-mo to get this weird band.2) camera... no good way to handle backlighting (without flash)...tried stopping down the exposure, but it seemed to do nothing.

My phone service switched from a CDMA system to a GSM system. This was by far the lowest priced GSM Galaxy S III I found.  If you are looking for an unlocked phone make sure you know what kind of service your phone company uses; CDMA or GSM.  Samsung makes the Galaxy line in both types but a GSM phone won't work on a CDMA system and vice versa.This phone came  with the ATT logo on the back, having been manufactured for ATT; and also came pre-loaded with ATT apps and phone numbers. It was easy enough to delete those that were not applicable.

Numerous times I tried to order this phone but by the time I got to final checkout Amazon would say it was out of stock even if the item was shown to be in stock (even with a count sometimes). Sometime the supplier would change mid selection as well. When I eventually placed an order the phone arrived very promptly, actually much faster than scheduled (it would have been nice if the tracking number was included in the notice of shipment). So low marks for the buying experience and tracking but the supplier gets high marks for prompt shipping.The phone itself works and pretty much as one expects from the model, a great phone. I do have a couple of gripes though. There was no operating manual (there was an extensive safety manual). Some on-line searching turned up a couple but no matching the version of Android installed so it is a bit of a game finding where various options are hidden. Another issue I have is that this is an AT&T; branded phone loaded with lots of AT&T; apps. No real issue with AT&T; and this model is designed with them in mind BUT the description is for any suitable network with no mention of AT&T.; For those who are not using using or fear accidental use of their network via those installed apps some instruction should be included.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this thing!", "Author": "Meredith", "ReviewID": "R12IXX4GV4RTZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first smartphone and I have been using it for about two months.

The only thing I do not like is the way to switch between or close apps, but hey- first-world problems!! I actually have to go to the home screen, then open a list of running apps. It just feels so clumsy compared with how everything else on the phone runs, which is so great.I would recommend this phone to anyone \"learning how to Smartphone\" (my daughter teased me).

This phone is big.  I generally keep it in my right front pants pocket.  In some dress slacks that are a little loose, it is noticeable that there is a bulky object in my pocket.

For the first time, the phone fell on my carpet and the screen cracked. I got it repaired from samsung by paying $170.The second time it again cracked just after 1 week of repair. This time cause of no fault of mine. The glass just cracked itself. Seemed a manufacturing defect on the stress ditributon. Samsung is not ready to own their mistake. Their representative even quoted that Samsung manufacturing is so perfect that there can be no manufacturing defect in any of their products. I am confused, why then give warranty on the phones or any of their products for that matter if their products are so defect free??They are demanding $170 again for the repair. Going by this, I will be shelling out $170 every week for the repairs.
