It is a genuine Samsung S3.  I purchased this for my wife, she took it to the ATT store where they plugged in a sim card and set it up within 5 minutes.  No problems at all.  It has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on our tile floor. I even like some of the displays better than my S4 which is probably associated with the S3 operating system.  The price was in line with other sellers. Breed shipped the phone right away.I had read a number of reviews on this product advertised elsewhere on Amazon and was concerned about receiving a clone or refurbished phone as described by some other buyers (even from the same seller).  However, I think that reviews may get bundled under specific product names so I suggest you just be sure what is being advertised for sale by the specific seller.  This ad was for a new S3 SGH-I747 (US model) ATT phone and that is exactly what we received.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "As described and a great phone", "Author": "Maranda", "ReviewID": "R3P9IS2JNG68K2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Galazy S3 is one of the best phones I've ever used.
