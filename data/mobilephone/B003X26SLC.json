{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Another Great Nokia", "Author": "tuesdays", "ReviewID": "R2T5ZT5ZB5HXX2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a loyal Nokia user since the 8860.  They have just always been fun, straight forward and easy to use phones.  The only thing Nokia lacks here in the USA is the customization options that the rest of the world enjoys on a daily basis.  Most phones are locked down by carriers and rebranded with their own applications here in the US.  This unlocked GSM capable Nokia makes that a thing of the past.  Don't want to pay AT&T; for an internet fee and a GPS navigation fee?  Done.  Want to delete whatever programs you wish from the phone?  Done.  Want to download apps that directly compete and are better than the ones AT&T; or T-Mobile force you to use?  Done.Calls come through loud and clear on AT&T;'s network.  I have full 3G coverage and have yet to drop a call.  When using the internet away from a WiFi network, you get access to AT&T;'s speedy 3.5G network.  3.5G comes in very handy when using the free GPS turn by turn navigation.  Yes, outside the US Nokia has been doing this for ages.  It's the greedy US carriers that have blocked it all these years.  Not anymore with an unlocked phone from Nokia, although you still need a data plan from your carrier.  Battery life is great too, but that's expected from Nokia.Messaging works great with easy access to received and sent texts, and the keyboard makes for speedy typing.  Plus several of the keys have very handy shortcuts to commonly used features such as bluetooth, emoticons (smileys) , and a flashlight.WiFi is a breeze to use.  You can view networks in range and even set priority levels for which ones you prefer to use.  The screen is a little small to be your go to surfing device, but it's more than competent for checking email, posting on facebook, and looking up sports scores.The device also comes with a mobile version of Microsoft Office document reader.  This is extremely handy for the mobile professional.One other great thing about this unlocked phone is that you can listen to FM or internet radio.  I have missed this feature since AT&T; began locking their phones down around the time of the Cingular branded Nokia 6230 (my still going strong backup phone).  Pair this with a 3.5mm headphone jack and the more than capable music player, and you have yourself a nice little music phone.The only complaint I have with this phone is the cheaper TFT screen Nokia used to keep the cost down.  This does cause the screen to become washed out in direct sunlight, but only from one side.  It's weird, if you tilt the phone to the left, the screen stays bright, but when you tilt the phone to the right, the screen becomes washed out.  With that said, I live in Denver where we get over 300 days of sun every year.  I have yet to be in a situation where I could not read the screen.  If its too dark you can simply change your theme to a brighter, more colorful one to help with visibility.Pros:Rock solid construction3G and 3.5G coverageWiFiFREE GPS TURN BY TURN NAVIGATION FOR LIFEQWERTY keyboard with shortcutsFlashlightInstall and delete appsFully customizable themesBattery LifeCons:Micro-SD card is under the batteryS-60 Symbian has a higher learning curveScreen not up to par with current smart phones", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "I am taking the time for this one!", "Author": "Elizabeth Hess", "ReviewID": "R3M41G8RQCESQM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I have to admit that I am not a big fan of writing reviews.  But, for the Nokia E5, this one deserves my time and effort.  For starters, you have to give credit to the company, all they do is phones and their parts and software can be found all over the world.  We go back and forth to the US, so this is a big buying point for us.Now for the review: the phone is solid; not plasticy or flimsy.  Guiding your way around the phone is easy and adventurous.  Accessing wifi, bluetooth, email, and SMS are very user friendly.  One user complained about the volume button, but I actually prefer that it is somewhat difficult to adjust.  I don't want it to change it every time I put it in my pocket.  In my opinion, the Keyboard is just the same if not better than the Blackberry.  I did not choose the Iphone 4 or mac products because I don't want to be sucked into the mac world.  I do have a life away from my phone.  It is all the screen I need.  If you want a bigger screen, buy a laptop.Pros:User friendly interfaceBattery life is greatKeyboard totally rocksMS office compatibleCamera with flashclear screen.Cons:Now my wife wants one", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty darn good, considering the price.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1PBGYW2XZ7SC7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The reason I keep buying NOKIAS is b/c of the value you get with the money you spend. This case is no different. This is my 4th NOKIA, with the E71 being the last one I owned. At first, I was thinking about getting an N8, but opted for this instead. According to PHONEARENA.COM, its got the same hardware inside...256 MB Ram and 680 MHZ Processor. Though, I must admit that is a really good looking phone. Tempting as it may have been, I haven't had stellar experiences with a NOKIA that is not E-Series. And the fact that the battery isn't removable didn't quite help in my decision.I bought this one at Newegg as it was cheaper than Amazon at the time. If you need a budget phone with capabilities of high end phones, this phone is for you. If however, you have high expectations, thinking this a \"Blackberry\" killer, skip it.Likes:>FREE Lifetime Navigation(spoken turn by turn directions) with FREE MAP UPDATES. You could use this offline, with no internet access as the maps are already preloaded on the Micro SD Memory card. You can update this using OVI MAPS Software.>Call Quality. After a month of use, so far no call drops and everyone sounds crisp and clear.>Response is pretty darn good in comparison to all other Nokias I've owned. Meaning programs load faster and run smoother.Dislikes:>VOLUME BUTTON! YOU WILL HATE THIS! WORST BUTTON ON ANYTHING I'VE EVER USED. This is especially irritating if you plan to use this to play your tunes, which I used to do with N97, 5800, E71. You need a lot of pressure to turn the volume up or down. If you plan on keeping it at a constant volume, this is not a problem. But it is for me.>Browser...Stay away from their browser, use OPERA MOBILE 10 instead. I've had the browser freeze on me a couple of times.>Looks. Coming from an E71 it's a downgrade.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Phone I have Ever Owned.", "Author": "NMDRG", "ReviewID": "R3QVY3FUSFZMTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I would like to say that when my iPhone broke, I still had a couple of months before I could get a new phone so I decided on something that looked usable and cheap until I could upgrade to the next iPhone. Boy was I wrong. In my opinion, this is the best phone I have ever owned; and is much better from the iPhone and other competitors.PROS:The Ovi Software Suite: Ovi has an amazing array of software that may not be as extensive as the Android or iPhone Marketplaces, but it has all of the necessary applications that are realistic to use in real life scenarios. The sheer amount of default apps it comes with should suffice for most users including the most useful application: Ovi Maps. Ovi Maps is an amazing software that is simply so useful. I never need a GPS again because it has a free one that is simply integrated right into my system. Its free, no need of a data plan, and its updated.The Look & Feel: This phone is one damn sexy phone. Many of my friends have asked me what kind of phone this is because it is simply such a good looking phone. It has a nice aluminum backing on it that gives it a shine and a high build quality feel. It also uses metal in a lot of the front such as for the call begin/end buttons and the hotkey buttons along with their directional buttons. It gives it a high quality feel that when you touch it you know that you're using a high quality device.The Keyboard & Texting: The feel of the keys is amazing. They are slightly raised and bulbous so that it gives you a good feel for each key. The key placement is honestly the best I have ever used on a full keyboard phone, with the space bar being extremely large and placed right in the middle for easy access. The keys are incredibly well placed and after 1 month of use I was able to text accurately and quickly without even looking at the phone because each key was so distinct in feel. I usually was not a fan of the full keyboard (hence why I had a touch screen iPhone before) but this device changed my opinion on it. The texting recognition is very good on this phone and you can easily and quickly fix mistakes with an ever changing and ever updating custom dictionary of commonly used and misspelled words that you type. Its very convenient and very easy to use.Calling: Calling on this phone there is simply no downsides, which is impressive in this day and age. Frequently people forget to mention how important calling other people is because of all the new features phones have. On this device, there is consistent, high quality, and easy to use calling. It has great contact management and makes calling on a phone a good feature instead of a downside like it is on the iPhone. I wish more modern phones did calling as well as the Nokia E5 did because it simply does it the right way, nothing stellar or revolutionary, simply the way calling was meant to be done. And on that note, the speakers on this device, are VERY LOUD. So most of the time I would not recommend keeping the speakers all the way up, because when you get a text or call the whole room will turn.Battery Life: This thing is a beast. I send an average of 50 Text messages a day and am constantly checking my phone and doing something on it, and I can get 2 days of battery life. It has a power saving mode that REALLY saves power. This thing is a beast when it comes to battery. Didn't charge it all yesterday and at the time I writing this review only 60% power left. Hell yeah.Other/Miscellaneous: Great Camera (5 MP) I have been complimented on how clear the pictures on my phone come out. Its no Camera replacement, but its not a hindrance to this phone. Awesome Flashlight. By holding down the space bar, the LED used for pictures becomes a flashlight, and it is very bright and very useful. Wifi. Wifi is available on this phone, so you don't even need a data plan because Wifi hotspots are everywhere now. I used to think having a data plan was necessary, but this phone really changed my mind and now my pocket is much heavier because of it. Awesome Profile switching. You can flip between modes on this phone like no tomorrow. There are millions of different sound customizations that you can toggle through so quickly. Its great to be able to switch from outdoor mode to silent mode to pager mode to normal mode in the press of a button. The Amount of features. Although I don't use them, it has the ability to print from the phone, view documents, edit documents, and all this crazy stuff. I have tested it and it works awesome, its nice to know that you can create a powerpoint on your phone and email it to your teacher and then print out your paper from your phone. Also it has flash and java on this phone for youtube and stuff like that. That is pretty sweet.CONS:Video Recording: If you want to record video on your phone, don't do it on this one. The actual video comes out great. BUT you cannot hear ANYTHING. Everything is completely mute and you cannot hear anyone speaking. This is very inconvenient when you simply want to record something, but you simply can't. I really don't record many things on my phone, but now I know I cannot so I simply don't...The Screen: Although this device is great, the screen is kind of crappy. It really isn't that bright, and you have to increase the brightness all the way if you want to view it outside. It also makes images look pixelated and bad because it really doesn't have that great of a resolution. But its useable.The Web Browser: Crashes all the time, really crappy, horrible UI, and its just junk. Download Opera to your phone. 'nuff said.Overall, this phone is amazing. It is $200 of the best money I've ever spent. I prefer this to all phones out there on the market now including my previous iPhone 3G. Sure there are some downsides, but I really don't care. The upsides of this phone are too numerous to count. It is simply the greatest phone for the value and for the features. I would have payed $400 for this phone. When you have this phone, you have a GPS, an internet device, a camera, a music player, and a phone. This is the only device I'll ever need in my pocket. Thank you for reading, and I, once more, HIGHLY recommend this phone.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great value/price ratio", "Author": "Moy Azabache \"Le Mou\"", "ReviewID": "R1NE7083JIVMW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was hesitatig about buying this product since there some reviews stating that this phone is below E72. Well, it is in absolute numbers since it does not come with secondary camera, which I've never used in E71 and E72, however, the SO is clearly more stable and runs faster, designed also to incorporate facebook and twiter among other social networks apps natively.Also, the assisted GPS computes your position faster than E72. I can say this because I did a simple benchmark between them. E5 took less than 10 secs, E72 more than 3 minutes.The keyboard, although similar in size and key distribution, is more comfortable, I guess it is due to an improved key shape and they are slighly wider, which is very noticeable when writing.The camera is 5MP, I guess is the same. I have to say that comparing only pixels in c\u00e1meras is like comparing food only with calories or cars with hp. There are more things to evaluate.The construction.... well, I don't know why people complain a lot about plastic construction since it's very similar to that of the E72, all plastic but the battery cover, made of stainless steel, which gives a nice feeling. Ok, it is not fron a casting as the E71 but that doesn't mean it has a weak built, it feels rock solid and less suceptible to be damaged since it weights less and then less energy is needed to be absorbed, thus less prone to be damaged.In general conclusion it's a great phone, with less features like the secondary camera, which I never use, but it costs less and IT HAS improvements learned from the very unstable E72.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great hardware, buggy software, poor support", "Author": "DaveC2000 \"davec2000\"", "ReviewID": "R3QZEHDO2XXVF1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The E5 is a really solid phone, with great hardware features. The phone software and the associated Ovi Suite PC software in incredibly finnicky, getting things to work in complete harmony seems to be just a bit out of reach for this phone. I am a very technical user, so I can usually fiddle with it enough to get a certain feature to work again after something caused the settings to go awry. It doesn't \"just work\" out of the box.. this is definitely the anti-iphone.Calling Nokia support is miserable, if you get through to a techie, they have never actually laid hands on this phone and lead you through steps that don't even exist in the menus.You can't update your maps on Ovi Suite like you can with other Nokias... don't ever lose your map files.. no one at Nokia can tell you how to get them back without RMA'ing the whole phone... unbelievable!

There's ovi contacts backup that I plan to try.2. music/video player - greatSpeaker is nice and loud, and music is even better with headset.I have a 8 GB microSD card in my old phone.The E5 comes with a 2 GB card, almost completely full (with Ovi Maps, I suppose).I copied everything from the 2 GB card to my 8 GB card, and put that in the E5.I have all my music and mp4 video on the go.I find the volume rocker hard to press, the 8\" microUSB data cable too short,and lack of support for displaying foreign language such as Chinese.Can expand memory to 32 GB according to Nokia website, and 16 GB according to Amazon.Using Bluetooth A2DP, I can also stream music to my stereo.There's more. It comes with: internet radio, and fm radio, and Youtube.Internet radio is nice, and an extensive directory is provided for even more music.3. 5MP camera - okayPictures come out fine, and I use Bluetooth to transfer photos to pc.There's more. Pressing space bar, the builtin flash becomes a handy flashlight.You can also record video, but be aware that the recorded audio is not sufficiently loud.With the Nokia E5, everything works out of the box. This is one exception, I suppose.4. 2.36\" screen - beautiful, but smallScreen is bright, and stunning.Though I need to adjust to the smaller screen size and the \"out-dated\" UI (Symbian OS version v. 9.3 [S60 3rd Edition, Feature Pack 2]),since my previous phone was a touch screen.We use a laptop or a TV, for a bigger screen any ways.You can have two home screens, with many ways to configure each home screen.I also use voice commands to bring up applications and contacts,though I have not figured out how to do this for Opera web browser.5. offline GPS with free NAVTEQ maps - goodDrive/walk navigation is voice-guided with street names, though not always taking a direct route.The phone has 4 GPS positioning modes:integrated GPS, assisted GPS, Bluetooth GPS, Network.I prefer integrated GPS, because this is offline but slower,and assisted GPS and Network modes can be faster but require data network access,which I have found unreliable when traveling with my previous phone.You can also download the Google Maps app. But why bother?6. messagingExcellent qwerty keyboard, an improvement over a touch screen.The phone provides access to (basic) Facebook, etc.You can download Socially app to access Linkedin, etc.7. mobile web access and search via WiFi or 3G - okayI download Opera as an alternate web browser.General web access is poor because of limited screen size.I try to use Vlingo Voice for quick web searches, which brings up the default browser, but Vlingo does not always work well.For example, you can just say: \"search Nokia E7 review\"You can also download the Google app. I am waiting for the Bing app, working with GPS.There's more. It comes with Traveler app that shows weather forecast every morning.8. push email via WiFi or 3G - greatThe E5 qwerty keyboard is great for email, and there's read-to-me.Nokia makes this simple to setup and use, with Nokia Messaging from email nokia.com and SmartConnect.Recent in May, I update the phone to use the latest, better looking Email app.There's more. It comes with Adobe PDF and QuickOffice apps.Be aware that there is no builtin support for displaying email in foreign language such as Chinese,and I use the Opera browser for this. Interestingly, the Chinese dictionary on the E5 works fine.9. multi-taskingUnlike other phones, the E5 multitasks effortlessly, and is simple to switch among tasks.10. battery life - beyond excellentI use many of above features for 2-3 days without recharging.The E5 can be charged using either 2mm charger or micro usb.Lastly, the Nokia E5 is an affordable, well-rounded phone with many useful capabilities,replacing compact camera, my iPod, maps & standalone GPS, watchand frees from the need to get a data plan.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best bang for buck.", "Author": "rick", "ReviewID": "R2XONF4DV7DTM4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With the iPhone and Android touchscreen slabs saturating the smartphone market, I began to wonder if physical controls were going to go extinct.

Performance is better, It has more internal memory (around 256 MB) and support for more external memory cards (up to 32 GB), 5 MP camera (as a standard) and other factors (new S60v3 OS). I'm already feel ok with my new phone, it supports everything about software (Facebook, WLM, Twitter, YouTube, WhatsApp, QuickOffice, etc).I want to recommend this phone, if you are thinking in an enterprise mobile solution; you don't have nothing to loose and very much to gain with this model.

Schroeder", "ReviewID": "R2CG5W15F03RZB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Revised October 17, 2011.  Rating changed from 1 star to 4 stars.I placed this cell phone in service on April 29, 2011.  In early September it would not turn on.  All recovery procedures recommended by Nokia's support site failed or were impossible to implement because the phone would not turn on.  The telephone was sent to the Nokia repair center for warranty service. In accordance with their instructions I removed the battery.  The phone was out of their center in a week.  When I tried to start it upon its return it would not turn on.  I then visited a cell phone repair center here in Panama that is under contract with my cell phone provider.  They tried a new battery and the cell phone returned to life.  I never had a catastrophic failure of the battery before and did not suspect that problem.I do believe that Nokia could have found the defective battery if they would have required that the battery be sent in with the phone for warranty repairs.On the day that I purchased the new battery and had my phone back in service, I received a call from Nokia asking about their repair service.  Now that I consider a great plus in their favor.Overall, aside from the battery failure, I would give this phone 4 stars.  The most objectionable drawback is the readability of the screen in direct sunlight.  I am not an expert in this area but I have seen other phones that are easier to read in that situation.No problems in the quality and volume of the audio.I did have some problems in the initial setup of the phone which were probably caused by pushing the wrong keys in my exploration of the new device.  Here I must commend both Nokia and ATT service people for the excellent assistance they gave me over the phone.  Once I overcame those initial problems I had no difficulty using the phone for two weeks in the United States, with ATT and the Skype facility.  When I returned to Panama I changed the SIM card to my local provider.  The numbers on that SIM were easily brought forward to the phone.I use Skype and have found it works well, a little slow in the signing in at times but good call quality and it's easy to use my contact list.  I have tested the email capability with Gmail but it is difficult to use the small key board and screen to manage the emails.  Perhaps with  more practice I will be more comfortable with email on this phone.When I was looking for this phone I had 3 basic requirements, GSM service, Wi-Fi capability and Skype compatibility.  The first two could be ascertained from the product descriptions provided by the seller.  To determine if the phone was Skype capable I used the Skype website.  When I was searching there were many Nokia phones listed as Skype capable and few from other manufacturers.  That has changed a bit now with some Android phones listed on the Skype website, but the prices on those are much higher that the cost of this phone.I find this to be a good phone, a great value.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Kept Secret in Tech Market", "Author": "ManhassetZ", "ReviewID": "R3AHPD0Q7QUJVW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nokia E-5 surpassed all my expectations by a wide margin and its performance for the price is exceptional. The phone, which is made in Mexico, fits easily in your hand and the construction feels very sold.  The call quality and the speakerphone are excellent with no dropped calls.  The battery life is extraordinary, the screen is clear and bright, and the small keyboard is easy to type on.  However, what makes the E-5 really impressive is that it is much more than a phone it is a mini computer that comes with 250 MB of internal memory and 256 MB of RAM, which in the words of one reviewer \"makes it run like an excited mouse.\"  The things you can do with the device seem endless.  Sure you can take pictures, video and listen to FM radio but that is pretty mundane stuff.  Where it really gets interesting is that you can download files from your computer and make use of them.  For example, you can download Microsoft Word and Excel documents and open, read and make changes in them or you can create new documents.  You can download and watch or listen to video and audio files, and you can download turn by turn directions for any place in the world and use the phone (mini computer) as a GPS.  All this and much more can be done without paying your cell phone carrier (mine is T-Mobile) any additional monthly fees for a data plan.  The other features that make the phone so compelling is that you can easily use your existing wifi connection or any other available hot spot to access the web (you can also pay your cell phone carrier for constant access to the web if you need it).  With access to the web you can watch YouTube and other videos, read and write email, listen to Internet radio and get additional applications, utilities and games from Nokia through the Ovi store.  This is where Nokia really shines with its support for the phone through both the Ovi store software and its company web site.  The Nokia web site is something special and provides access to all you need to know about the E-5.  The link is provided should you wish to take a look.[...]Is the phone perfect?  The answer is not quite.  The 2 Gig SD card that comes with the phone is on the small side.  However, the phone accepts cards up to 32 Gig and most users will quickly see that a 4 Gig card makes more sense, which is what I am now using in mine.  Other quibbles include the fact that the SD card is inside the phone behind the battery, which must be removed to replace the card.  But then it is not something you need to do very often.  Finally, there is the Symbian S-60 operating system, which is likely to be replaced over the next few years as Nokia transitions its customers to Windows based phones.  My experience with the Symbian system has been mostly positive but it does have a learning curve, particularly if you have never used a Symbian device before.

(I hate touchscreens); c) It has buttons!!  :) (Did I mention that I hate touchscreen?); c) This phone was advertised as being both US and Int'l. A little bird who works for AT&T; told me that their system has trouble reading int'l phones.  If their system sees a smart phone it will automatically add a data plan whether you ask for it or not (that just seems illegal to me!.) However, they have trouble with int'l phones so the data plans may not automatically be added.  [In my case, that didn't work completely.  A data plan was added.  I did call and demanded that the data plan be removed.  The girl I spoke with did seem to have trouble figuring out what kind of cell phone I had.  She  kept asking me for specifics on it, which I did not give her.  All she got out of me was \"I have a Nokia\" and \"No, I don't know what kind it is\".  The data plan came off. (Hope it stays off!!)]So, the phone has buttons and does not have touchscreen!!  YAY!! (This is HUGE in my book!) Overall, I think I like this phone.  I really loved my old phone so it was difficult accepting a new one but as I've gotten used to it, I do like it.  It has great reception.  It's fast.... text messages go out quickly, wifi is quick.  I do like the GPS feature that comes with the phone, especially since you don't need internet to use it.  I must warn everyone that the phone will need updates and FYI, updating the GPS maps can take a VERY long time.  I started the process at work and had to leave my phone at work overnight because after 6 hours, the map updates were only about 50% complete.  Be aware of this and plan to update the maps accordingly.  Updates of the phone software itself is quick.  The syncing software that comes with this phone is very clean and easy to navigate. It also holds a charge VERY well and is not a battery hog.  This phone was perfectly designed for those of us who reject the hysteria around iPhones et al, need a phone for calls and texting only, and aren't looking for a new toy.Overall, if you're trying to avoid data plans but want a smart phone for the buttons (for ease of texting) plus a few other perks, I'd say this phone is the way to go.

Yes the OS is not as nice as the iphone or blackberry. However, it works. Also, Ovi has Opera mini which is not found on the other OS. This makes web browsing much faster as your loading smaller pages, not the full sized pages. For email, I have found that it syncs just as well as any blackberries and better than iphones which is something I really like.Another good news is that it works on 3G in the US. Even better though is the AT&T; plan is 15 dollars for unlimited usage which is much better than their iphone rates of 15 dollars only getting you 200mb. Next, you can tether this to your computer for internet as well as using Joikuspot as a hotspot! Both of which are allowed, and you do not need to jailbreak/root your phone that would void the warranty.Unfortunately, this phone lacks Kindle and Pandora applications which was a disappointment.

Landed in the middle with 4 stars in the end. I've had this phone for a few days but having previously owned an N73 and a 5800 music express, continue with good old symbian was a smooth transition. That is also a sore spot for me because this phone was released August 2010 and its still running the same old software. Granted it has a few firmware updates from the E71 (i also purchased one of these as a gift for a friend), its still not enough. However, overall this device is quite functional with WiFi, 3G, GPS, Push Email, Quick Office, all types of messaging, good battery life, 3.5mm headphone jack (the E71 had 2.5mm), up to 32gb memory cards, it filled the gap my 5800 left and i was able to get back all of my apps.I was worried about always having to use a qwerty keyboard (the 5800xm provided both that and an alpha numeric pad) but so far the experience has been good. I have big fingers and I don't particularly find the keypad to be cramped. It is much more spacious than the E71. The major con is that the camera is awful. For 5mp it is simply poor. And Nokia making it fixed focus...I really don't see the rational as all of their previous 3.2mps have auto focus. Somehow the flash is overpowering, so night pictures just come out white. But in good light it seems pretty decent.I should also note that this is the cheapest phone I have ever purchased but it has the fastest processor (Hope there isnt some hidden problem yet to be discovered). I haven't experienced any sticking switching between apps so the extra boost the 256mb of ram gives is quite apparent.

If detected you cannot use the \"texting/feature\" phone data plan.  AT&T; categorizes Symbian OS devices as smartphones and therefore excludes them from the \"texting/feature\" phone data plans.Yes, switch off 3G connectivity when using voice, SMS/MMS and wifi features only (no data plan).

Construction, at the very least, gives the impression of a well made unit, the backside being metal something rarely found on a cell phone these days. Yes, the volume control is a bit stiff as some have stated, but there's plenty of available volume and for those of us whose hearing is not what it used to be that's what REALLY counts.

Miller \"Radman\"", "ReviewID": "R1IZU7AV2R9Z5C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have become an unwilling connoisseur of cell phones due to a string of purchases over the last three years. I don't care to pick apart a phone and armchair quarterback the engineering. I am a consumer that just spent his hard earned money to buy something that he expects to work for the purpose(s) for which he bought the device.There are two distinct and equally important phases of a cell phone review. This is the first phase covering the first few days of ownership. The second phase comes after several weeks of actual day to day usage.My initial impression is that the hardware, for the money is excellent. The build quality is immediately evident and should translate into length of useful life. This is a harsh lesson that I learned after being an owner of an N85.Although the hardware is not the best on the market, not even Nokia's best; Bang for the buck, after considering the hardware and features, It is difficult to imagine a better deal for the consumer from the standpoint of price V quality. There were good decisions made for tradeoffs and functionality.That said, some of the software implementation is puzzling and/or infuriating:1. Ovi Suite (the software which interfaces the phone with the computer and PIM such as Outlook) Is buggy. It took three installations and as many days before I was able to get it working correctly. There were various issues. It would not be helpful to go into detail here.2. Nokia continues to refuse to allow the consumer to fully customize the home page. One particularly infuriating example is that in the horizontal bar mode, you MUST have the Ovi chat prompt or status displayed. This takes up valuable real estate and it is my guess that most people will not want to use it at all.3. Ovi suite seems to have a focus on multimedia where PC suite, though not as polished is more straight to the point of synchronization. However, there seems to be some issues with the application installer on PC Suite and this phone, which prompted me to use OVI.4. Mail for exchange is iffy at best. If it is incorrectly configured, the only indication is that it will not contain any outlook items. It will tell you that it is connected even when it is not. I have seen an android application that can configure itself with just the user name password and the outlook web access URL. MFE seems to require congressional hearings and a sacrificial goat, for proper configuration.In summary, thus far, I am happy with the phone and the price that I paid for it. I would recommend it with a caution that you don't get your hopes up for use as an actual business phone (this part may or may not change when I update this review in a few  weeks).UPDATE:After a month and a half of ownership, I have upgraded my rating from three to four stars. I still stand by everything that i stated earlier,but have found ways to either work around or cope with the shortcommings. Given that, the phone is a solid buy. I did notice that the price of the phone went up by $30.00 since I bought it.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent phone with some quirks", "Author": "bluebug83", "ReviewID": "RYRJPP6NMKDRJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent a lot of time looking at phones before I found one I liked, and I originally chose this one because I liked the feature set. It was purchased with the intent to use it with a T-Mobile prepaid plan that offers a very limited amount of data, so data features would be used primarily when connected to WiFi networks. I didn't really want an Android/iPhone, as I don't like touch screen keyboards and don't feel a need to download apps, nor am I fan of flip phones or those with sliding keyboards. So I thought I would try a candy bar design with a \"Blackberry\" style keyboard. I also really liked the fact that it had a GPS that I could use without a data plan, since I used my Garmin GPS frequently. I also liked that the phone could do everything else I wanted: e-mail, calendar, alarm reminders, Facebook, simple web browsing, etc. This phone seemed to be a rare option that included all these features. I also liked the fact that it was a Nokia, as I had owned Nokias before and found those to have good signal and call quality and battery life.I have now owned this phone for 9+ months, so here are my thoughts regarding the features I frequently use on the Nokia E5.Basic phone features: Call quality, signal strength, and battery life are all excellent, just as they had been with my previous Nokias. If I am not roaming, I can easily get a few days worth out of a single battery charge with it continuously on - much more than my husband's Motorola Razr Android phone. I usually pick it up and use it for 5-10 minute stretches intermittently during the day, and don't make calls very often. The OS is a bit outdated, and menus can be non-intuitive and clumsy to navigate. There are certain settings that have taken me awhile to find, or find again after I have visited them before. Sometimes the phone can hang up for a couple seconds when opening/closing an app, or navigating menus, but I don't find this too bothersome. I really like the Blackberry style keyboard and find it easy to use. The \"call\" button can also be used to send an e-mail or text message, and due to the placement, I occasionally hit this and prematurely send the message before I am done typing it.Data access configuration: The E5 allows you to search for, save, and assign priority to configured WiFi access points, and will try to use one of those before using your packet data. It always asks me if I want to use packet data if I am not connected to a WiFi point, which is appreciated, as it allows me to easily ration the 30 MB of data offered by my plan. I am guessing this could be turned off for those with unlimited data.Texting: Texting and e-mail are easily accessible through a button on the phone. The interface shows how many 160 character long texts you have used when composing a message, and how many characters you have left of the current text. All of the incoming texts are displayed on one \"page\" and outgoing texts on another, and you can sort the texts by date, sender, etc. To my knowledge there is not a \"conversation\" view as there are on Android type phones, or my previous phone. This would be a nice feature to have.E-mail: The e-mail app is very easy to use to view, compose, and send e-mails, and allows you to configure more than one e-mail account. You can configure e-mail addresses for contacts in your address book. I have it configured to a private e-mail account that uses Gmail servers. E-mail setup is pretty easy if your e-mail is through a common provider (such as GMail, Yahoo, etc). E-mail access can only be configured directly to a single access point, unlike the other data features of the phone, which is disappointing since I have to manually change the setting if I want to get e-mail somewhere other than our home WiFi network. This would not be an issue for someone with unlimited data, as you could configure the access point to be packet data on your plan.Calendar: I was able to configure the E5 calendar app to use our Google account, so that the phone automatically syncs calendar entries - those made from the E5 will update our Google calendar account, and updates to our Google calendar made from other sources (such as the web interface or my husband's phone) will update the calendar on the E5. My E5 will notify me when a calendar entry is coming up. I had to go online to find instructions on how to do this, as it is not an intuitive process, but it is possible and it works very well. Note that the E5 can only sync to a single Google calendar account.Alarm clock: The options for entering recurring alarm entries is limited. When the alarm goes off, the screen flashes on and off, which makes it difficult to turn off or snooze the alarm. I have not found a way to change this setting, which is frustrating. The screen also does the same on/off flashing for calendar reminders.Web browser: It is a bit awkward to use since the screen is small, and the E5 does not have a touch screen, but does OK for basic web page browsing. Pages that have a mobile interface are much easier to view than pages that do not. I notice some web pages cause the browser to spontaneously close on me, which is frustrating.Camera: It's not the greatest quality, but is fine for taking quick photos on the go. There is a bit of a lag between pressing the button and capturing the photo, which makes it difficult to capture the perfect moment when taking pictures of my 6 month old. I prefer to use my high-end point and shoot if I want better photos. It is nice that the camera has an LED flash, so photos can be better captured in low light. The interface makes it very easy to e-mail or text photos right after they are taken.GPS: Sometimes it can take a long time to find the signal, but that is also true of my (~5 year old) standalone Garmin. You can download different voices for the GPS, a few of which include dictation of street names, etc. when reading directions. It is pretty good at looking up street addresses offline by typing the whole address in to the search bar - I prefer this over my Garmin which requires you to go through a \"wizard\" series of screens to look up an address. You can save addresses to the favorites menu. I notice the E5's GPS sometimes directs you through routes that are not always the fastest or make the most sense - it will get you there, but may not pick the most intuitive route. The E5 does not have as many offline pre-programmed points of interest as my Garmin, so I would not count on being able to look up a place offline without having the street address handy. I also notice my Garmin does other things that the E5's GPS does not do, such as allowing you to save your current position, or allowing you to search for points of interest along the route and map to one of those points as a stop on the way while keeping your destination fixed. I wish the E5 would recognize addresses in other apps (such as e-mail, web browser) and allow you to pull them up and map them in the OVI maps application - similar to what it does for phone numbers and calling functionality. In summary: I love the fact that I have a GPS in my phone that doesn't use data, and I still use this more than my standalone Garmin because it is more convenient. But the Garmin is better.Facebook: The phone comes pre-installed with a Facebook app, but there is a better one available for free download through the OVI store. Unfortunately, the phone won't allow me to delete the pre-loaded app, so I am stuck with two on my phone, and it is difficult to tell which is which. For the most part, the downloaded app is fine, as it provides a mobile-friendly interface to most features of Facebook. I have noticed some things I cannot access through the interface, such as comments on joined events or postings on joined groups. There is also not a way to upload a photo in phone memory to FB via the FB app, but I think there is a way to do this by downloading other apps. You can take a photo \"live\" and upload it to Facebook through the downloaded app. The FB app limits comments, messages, or status updates to 256 characters, which is disappointing, since FB itself doesn't have these limits.App store: The E5 uses Nokia's proprietary OVI app store, which is much more limited than Android or Apple. I don't mind this at all since I don't feel the need to download a lot of apps. I don't have any games, and most of the available games seem to require use of data. I think the only apps I have downloaded are the other Facebook app, and an application to use the camera's LED flash as a flashlight.In summary, I think the Nokia E5 is a decent phone that does everything I want a phone to do, and I have no regrets about having purchased it over the other options available. The phone's unique feature set and the things it does well more than offsets the annoyances and drawbacks to the phone. If, however, there was a different phone with a similar feature set (including keyboard style, offline GPS, etc) that was more refined, eliminated some of the annoyances of the E5, and wasn't much more expensive, I would probably consider that option.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia E5-00 unlocked", "Author": "Paula", "ReviewID": "R2DSXLT7E90AKT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had this phone for 15 months now and had no problems with its many functions.

I chose the E5 as my first smartphone, impressed by the wide variety of features it offered which I could use both at work and in everyday life. I don't need to play games, don't really have time for it anyway, but I do text a lot, and I travel to a lot of places, and I work a lot. So features like the full qwerty keyboard, the free Ovi Maps feature, and the excellent calendar and mobile office suite were ideal for me. I've since discovered that it also has a fantastic music player and can accept a 32 GB SDHC card, which opens up a lot of other possibilities.This phone isn't for everyone. It doesn't have all of the apps that are available for iPhone or Android devices, not by a long shot (although a Facebook app is available, if that's important to you). And it doesn't have a touch screen; you have to navigate the screen by moving the cursor using the navigation key above the keyboard, although this took me all of about 20 seconds to get the hang of. The operating system is a version of Nokia's own Symbian, which gets criticized as outdated compared to Android or iOS. But it works, and it works without slowing your phone down, so it gets my vote.The battery can hold a charge about three days on standby mode, and I get about 5-6 hours of talk time before I need to plug it in. The phone has a pretty good camera, is great at recording video (it does 480p), and holds connections well at either 3G or 3.5G/HSPA. I have to get really out into the sticks before it drops to EDGE.

Free Voice Guided NavigationCon's: Notification icons are so small  The ringer volume cannot be increased/decreased by pressing the side volume buttons alone; you must go into the menu  to lower the volume or press the little \"music key\", but then there are only two options by pressing that button.  Not nearly as many apps or the same apps as those found in the Android Market  When playing the radio, the wired headset has to be connected in order for the radio to be heard through loudspeaker  (speakerphone)Overall, I think this phone is pretty good. I chose this phone because of the free navigation, the 5mp camera, and it was a close as I could get to an Android  phone without having the touch screen. Android phones cost entirely too much for them to break so easily. If you're looking for a basic phone with a few extras, I would highly recommend it.

However, My wife's old Nokia 5800 died and she wanted a new phone. Since I only buy unlocked phones (we use them a lot overseas with different SIM cards) I did not have too many inexpensive choices. She needed a phone that would give her GPS, free maps and voice guidance without data access, and for than Nokias are the only game in town. When she got this phone something was not installed properly and her contacts would not even start up. After a lot of struggle I decided to do a hard reset (not a soft factory reset, which did not work) and it started working fine. Since then she has loved it. She does a lot of texting and keyboard works great for her (I hate it). She likes the white version that sets it apart from all the blackberries.

My old phone was a bare-bones Nokia I had for years.I bought the E5 because of the GPS feature and I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  The GPS is excellent; equal to or better than my Garmin.  I live in Almaty Kazakhstan and just a Garmin map for my Nuvi was a $200 adder from the one and only Garmin store here.  The E5's map is from Google Maps and is excellent in both directions and language options which can be downloaded for free.  Favorites are easy to save and lat-lon easy to read so they may be entered into Google Earth although this has to be done manually.  I am sure the rest of Kazakhstan will be just as easy to Navigate as Almaty; no simple feat!  GPS is a real life saver here and it is so nice to have it handy inside my phone. I just found out today Google Maps has a separate download that uses cell towers to approximate \"My Location\" without the use of satellites.  It pins me down to within a 60 meter diameter which is a nice function when I can't get a satellite signal and I want to know where I am.I am new to web brousing on a phone.  Also new to many of the apps available.  I have had the phone almost a month now and am just starting to get used to what it can do. It is not as user friendly as I would like but I can navigate quite well now.  Skype on Wifi works good but you have to go thru several screens to get to it.  The version of Yahoo Mail that the phone came with didn't work on Wifi but a downloaded version from Yahoo does. It would be nice to have a touch-screen for these applications and the next phone I buy will likely have it.  I would get more from a sim card with 3G but frankly the cost oughtweighs the expected benefits.Camera and video work quite well also.  5 mp is more than I ever need for pics.  Battery life is so far excellent.The keyboard is crisp and the characters easy to access even though I have quite big fingers. The display is quite bright even in sunlight.On the down side is the fact that there is no touch-screen and the time it has taken me to figure out the functions I use. The volume control on the right side of the phone sucks but I don't use the phone for music so it is no big deal.The phone has all the features I need.

At first the whole layout of how the home-screen is was a bit confusing to start with and to navigate around finding the features like how to change the timing for the keypad to lock, etc. Also, since I never had a full laid out keyboarded phone it is a bit hard to type but I will get used to the layout. The wi-fi works nicely. I can move at about 20ft from the router and still get good service. I tried out the gps in my area with just the gps feature and no a-gps or internet integrated gps. It was a bit off on the actual location but roughly i could tell where i was. I tried out the internet and local radio (local radio needs a headset to act as an antenna). Both worked really well giving me the song title. The thing i didnt like about the phone is the volume button as i saw someone else also mentioned that in their review. It would be nicer if the button's popped out a little bit more so its not like I'm pressing on the button and the body of the phone at the same time. There is a lot of other features on the phone that i still need to explore. Overall I'm glad with the purchase of this phone :)Update March 6th 2011:This phone is still well and functioning. My only issue with it is that when people call me it doesnt show their name. It only shows their number even after their name and number are on the contacts list in both the phone and on the sim card. So if I dont remember the number I have to guess who the person is who I am speaking to. Im not sure what to do with that issue though. That is why I now rate it 4 stars.Also, the phone comes with the 2gb memory card. Try not to update the maps because then your maps will get deleted (at least that was the case for me).

If you are looking for a cool looking phone, with good camera, and good reception, unlocked for the any network in the world, this is the phone for you.

Green", "ReviewID": "R25WI49F5KJD4C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Updated: 6/2/13This is the worse phone ever!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't even understand why there are so many good reviews because I would not recommend this phone at all. Now that I've owned it for a while I can honestly say that it freezes consistently. Sometimes I can't even make a phone call!! I will go to the contact, hit call, select the specific number I want to use and it will just go back to the contact. In order to finally make a call, I will either have to take out the battery and restart the phone or punch in the numbers manually. It also takes a long time for the phone call to go thru. It also shuts off for no apparent reason while I'm talking on it with a full charge. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!I've had the Nokia C3 for about 2 1/2 yrs and loved it, but as we all know cell phones don't last as long as regular phones so it was time for an upgrade. I wanted another Nokia mostly because of the GREAT battery life. As far as I'm concerned, no other phone can compare to Nokia in the battery department and having a touch screen w/all the other bells and whistles has never been important to me. However once receiving the Nokia E5 it left much to be desired. The manual that comes with the phone EXCLUDES a great deal of the phones features. For example when you enter a new contact which may have several numbers attached to it, you would want to assign a label to each number i.e., cell, home, work etc. I was on the phone with Nokia's customer service representative for approx. 45 minutes trying to figure out why the phone never gave me the option to assign the number type. Frustrated, I put the phone down and came back later and figured out that, that option is only available to numbers that have been saved to the PHONE, not to the SIM CARD!!! For every contact that had multiple phone numbers, I had to copy it to the phone, press options, press view details, press options, press edit, highlight the number I wanted to make the change to, press options , press edit label, type in new label name and press done. Also, on my old Nokia C3 I could easily view my text conversations with a specific contact. On the new Nokia E5 I can only look at sent messages or inbox messages for a specific contact. That isn't an upgrade, thats a DOWNGRADE!!!!! Also, you can only delete 1 message at a time, not your entire inbox, outbox or drafts. This is so frustrating. I'm so sorry I wasted my money and I will never buy another Nokia phone not matter what. For the price that sellers are asking for this phone, this is just plain ridiculous. Fortunately I only paid $99 on another website. I would have put the name of the website, but AMAZON will only block it out because it's their competition. I would not recommend paying a dime more than $50, so please look around or better yet, GET ANOTHER PHONE ALL TOGETHER!!!!!", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "it is just awesome", "Author": "Chatsy", "ReviewID": "R1T0GI4N3GWKIP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had it since last year.

I diverged briefly to another brand but came back to Nokia after my stellar experience with their earlier phones. I was very disappointed to discover upon receipt of this one, however, that the OS wasn't as advanced as the C2-01 (from 2011) I had; specifically, that the text messaging isn't possible natively to be in Conversation (or, Thread) mode (yeah, I contact Nokia and that's what I was told), so I had to find - with difficulty - on the Ovi / Nokia Store an app called ThreadSMS (via my PC's Nokia Suite software) which now does the job pretty well. Also, there some native games on my C2-01 that are non-existent on the e5-00. I thought I could find them in the Store, but nope, not there. Plus, the Alarm Clock on the C2-01 allowed me to set alarms by tick-box by day, whereas this one I'm forced to have the alarm go off on non-controllable set arrangements, such as \"Workdays.\" I have to \"reset\" the alarm each time I want to change it, rather than setting up multiple alarms with different settings by day, etc. The Nokia Suite software is very helpful for syncing, but not all of my messages could be synced due the inability in my e5 to do Conversations. Grrrr!Also, I had some difficulty setting up my \"Idle\" screen in that the default put a bunch of garbage on it like WLAN Scanning, which when pressed immediately rendered the phone inoperable with \"System Error\" displayed which could not be remedied besides pulling the battery out. I finally found an Idle Screen setting under Personalization that didn't have all that garbage and that particular trouble-maker and which also allowed me to set the features I wanted in the side bar and sub-menus (it's the side vertical setting). Also, I wasn't aware that buying the phone from a Puerto Rican seller meant that I'd get a bunch of in-the-way and useless-to-me Spanish language buttons and such on the keyboard, but for the price I paid I'm working on living with those annoyances. Now I have my phone set up as I want and it's working perfectly. Oh, and the solution to the WLAN ordeal I mentioned? I went to Menu>Ctrl. panel>Connectivity>WLAN wiz. and then when I'd set up my remembered networks, I added them to the \"SC\" under Connectivity to set up Connection Groups to remember so that my phone would automatically connect to an available remembered network. Very cool!I was pleasantly surprised to receive a very nice Nokia brand rubber protective sheath with my purchase. The standard 3 or 4-inch USB cable is highly annoying, so I had to buy a longer one to work with my set-up at home. It charges well in my truck and has a decent battery life. I had no problems pairing the e5 with my Motorolla bluetooth hands-free earpiece. The photos  I've taken have turned out really nice, as well.Now that I've worked through the set-up and using the phone for calls and texting, I'm quite happy with the phone.

I was first introduced to the E5 earlier this year when I had bought this phone as a present for my bro. Testing it out at that time was an incredible experience. I loved it so much that I bought this as my christmas preset. I am sure this phone has it's drawbacks like the lack of decent apps from the ovi store or not having a touch screen. I prefer the keyboard to text or type rather than the touch screen mini-keyboards on many of the popular brands today. This phone also has Wi-Fi, which can be used for email, web, facebook, twitter...whatever, thus even if you have a limited data plan (or even no data plan) - you still have wi-fi! The most important feature of this phone, which is often overlooked in most of the reviews these days for smartPHONES - Yes it does make phone calls and the quality is good. The wired hands-free handset does not work though. I haven't been able to make it work yet (It should be pretty simple...right). Apparently there have been some issues with the E5 and the hands free feature. It has Bluetooth though which works just fine!All in all - a good phone for the price and for the value and features. In my opinion this one has some better features than the E71. Camera is better, max memory support is bigger, and I don't think E71 has wi-fi.Hope this has helped the future buyers of this phone.

I purchased mine thru Straight Talk and the $45/month plan was required for this phone.- Google maps works well with this phone, however, since it is not a touch screen, it takes a while to figure out the functions. The voice search does work with this phone (a must have).  Traffic updates and aerial maps also work well.- It has a built in navigational GPS that seems to do an adequate job, but again, not really user friendly trying to figure out the key functions.  Probably dangerous while driving if you need to make adjustments.- It will sync with Outlook.- The Nokia suite as well as the phone are rather un-user friendly.  It took me hours of reading thru the manual to figure out all of the functions and I am a mediocre tech savy person.- Web browsing seems as good as a blackberry torch I used to have although the screen is smaller and again, it is not a touch screen.- I am disappointed in limitations of the tone/vibrate functions. You can add a different tone for each of the alarm, email, text, calendar, etc., functions, however, the vibrate is either on or off for everything.- So far I am not sure how to stop the alarm on a calendar notification.- The keyboard buttons are rather small,- You can sync your individual email accounts including yahoo, hotmail, etc.- The home screen icons are programmable but I wish there was a little more flexibility.- Apparently, not supported by bible.org so I am apparently loosing my bible reader.  I tried one on the ovi store, but it keep hanging up and could not get it to scroll.- Because the buttons are so small, it is a little difficult to dial a number.- It will play Youtube videos using RealPlayer that is preinstalled.- Messaging seems to work well.  Interestingly enough, it is probably more geared to messaging than phone use.- The music player works fine although not very loud.- The phone from Straight talk came with a rubber cover, and wired headphones.Bottom line, this is an OK smart phone, although not particularly user friendly.  I'll update after I have had a better sample.  I am headed out of town soon, so I'll be better able to comment on coverage.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "with Straightalk it drops connection regularly", "Author": "Jerry T Rolland", "ReviewID": "R3GZFBJ4G3G324", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought one of these to use with Straightalk and I think there is a problem with the antenna on this device.

Gransar\"", "ReviewID": "R2TXJNX2FJTH7Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phones now a days are coming to replace laptops and are packed with as many features ... and so there are different targets for every phone. Some people want run applications, while others like to take pictures and fool around the photos. We could think that business people like a certain type of phone that can read word files and pdf files with ease while they are texting their friend on metro. Having my Nokia N95 phone stolen had me search for simple phone just to call and text. Then I saw Nokia C3 and after comparing many other phones in the same budget finally decided to buy this one because of advanced features of Facebook and Gmail connectivity shipped in with it.Couple of people started the idea that the screen is not bright. While checking screen after turning it on and checking specially under direct sunlight at noon I could clearly make out the text. What was uncomfortable was the sunlight and I think these days you can never avoid sunlight enough... its bad for both you and your phone! In fact the lcd screen is as bright and clear as it gets and anything more would drain the battery -- then you are not getting three days charge free!This is a really solid phone in your my hand and feels right! It looks much better than shown in the image here. People have complement it and it is stylish in its own way. I have dropped it twice now and I feel it's accident-proof as well.My biggest fear buying this phone was tactile response from the keys. While the keys are relatively easy to input my typing speed has not improved, over my Nokia N95 which wasn't qwerty. I think I carry the habit of just using my right thumb whereas this phone (to naturally hold) demands both thumbs.I thought about the interface and and even attempted to redesign the keys and screen to before giving up... Should we get rid of the buttons on the top of keyboard and somehow adopt the qwerty?  This would that make the key's bigger? How can I increase the width of the keys...? What if the ok/green, cancel/red buttons were in the bottom instead of the middle?One of most important keys, the numbers, which are essential to a phone are a bit hidden... but I would get used to it. And the placement zero next to nine is unconventional which I won't get used to. I learned that the large screen rules, and nokia doesn't make the best use of it. Symbian loves to provide maze of options... not taking advantage of the large screen and often it is leaving it blank or small. For instance when you call someone, you have have their name and number listed at all times. One great thing though is that navigating the contact during conversation is possible (that businessman in metro is now cheering this feature with friends in a pub!)Furthermore being thin is a virtue, because it slides easy into the pocket and does not poking out of the pockets like other phones do.The first thing I did with this phone was to turn on predictive text. This made typing faster. The program learns new words, like my last name and doesn't want to replace \"salam\" with \"salami\". I wish now  that it memorized wifi names and passwords as well and doesn't ask for them every time! I think this can be set up in the settings somewhere...There are some nice shortcuts on this phone. For instance, if you begin typing someone's name instead of inputing the number the contact list begins to narrow down the list and to provide suggestions... (the businessman can easy find contacts!) Also holding the arrow keys while the phone is lock shows time and date in a large format. The flash light is really a nice feature that cell-phones don't have anymore and Nokia dedicated the space key, the largest key key's to the phone which is awesome.I replaced the memory with 16 buttons to put lots of music on it, and up to 5 gigabit there is no problem. Though creating a playlist and selecting all the songs wasn't easy.The connectivity left something to be desired. The usb cable doesn't have the universal plug (like N95) and it is still not quite so compatible with macs, but having a standard headphone jack means you can connect your favorite headphones. I haven't had a chance to connect to the web with this phone often... which is a promise of this phone. This is partly because wifi and password is required every time (unless they are stored somewhere in the options which i have to find). But I don't rely on phone for internet. But for home and workplace a button shortcut to detect and connect to wifi would have been really nice feature.Another thing that I rely on greatly is the speakers. The position of the speakers are on the back and when talking on speakers its broadcasting their sound away while the microphone is on the front side and it feels either the speaking quality or hearing quality (which ever way you choose to hold the phone) greatly diminishes the sound quality. Also because naturally phone is placed on its back, it feels the ringtone is drained.They photo quality is nice and great to take picture of the note on the whiteboard (remember that businessman?) I took some artistic photos which I uploaded and demonstrates that the quality exceeds our expectations here.All the criticism above just remove one starts and I give Nokia E5 4 stars.

From the reviews listed here, and some independent Google searches, I felt I had made a wise purchase. I knew the phone was still running the old Symbian OS but the list of features and the attractive price offered a good value.  Unfortunately, the phone was a bust. The Symbian OS was functional but incredibly buggy. My wife is not a techie and I felt this type of OS might benefit her with its rather simple interface. The problems started immediately after powering on the phone with her ATT Sim card. The contact list would not open. The application would continue to crash regardless of what you did. I did my typical Google searches and found out that others had this similar problem. They recommended a slew of possible fixes such as removing the SIM card, removing the memory card, upgrading the firmware and factory resetting the phone. No luck.  Its hard to image how you can mess up such as simple yet important feature of a phone. The phone also came with a 2GB memory card completely full of useless OVI maps on cities from around the world. I spent nearly 30 minutes trying to figure out how to delete this junk via the phone interface. I finally decided to mount the phone as a usb drive and just delete the data from Windows.  After spending a few more hours trying to debug this phone, I called it quits and returned the phone the next day.

Hearn", "ReviewID": "R2XPHEFMA8LZKD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just received this phone today. I purchased it though a \"lightening deal\" on Amazon.com over Christmas.  My reasons for purchasing this phone were two-fold. #1, I have a really old flip Samsung phone.  I have a prepaid plan with T-Mobile where I only pay $100 per year, and I always have \"leftover\" minutes as I only use my cell phone for an emergency, so I wanted to \"update\" my phone.  #2, I wanted to be able to use it when I go to Europe by simply using a different SIM card.I do not have a data plan, as I'm on a prepaid plan.  But the phone is supposed to have WiFi.  Note \"supposed to\".  I have an iPod Touch, which works GREAT on WiFi.  I was thinking that this phone would be similar to that. . . That I could use many of the features through WiFi.  That doesn't really work so well.Let me just go ahead and list all the horrible things about this phone. . . .* WiFi - It's a nightmare.  I have yet to find a way to tell it to connect to WiFi at my house and leave it on all the time.  There is no \"simple\" way. . . that I have found. . . to connect to WiFi.  When you try and connect it will then ask you \"what you want to do with it\" or \"how you want to connect\".  JUST CONNECT AND BE DONE WITH IT!  If you chose the wrong \"option\" then it just doesn't connect at all.* I can't tell if WiFi is working or not.* Even if you know that WiFi is connected, when you try and do certain things, it will still try connecting through cell service. . . which it can't do, because I don't have a data plan, so you just receive an error.* The \"operating system\" this phone uses is supposed to be used by more phones around the world than any other system. . . but. . . there is a reason why it's not used in the U.S. . . . IT STINKS!  On top of this, I recently read that even Nokia is going to stop using it and change to Windows!!!  Listen!  You REALLY want either an iPhone or an Android phone.  Something that is EASY and USER-FRIENDLY to use.  This operating system is NOT easy to use and STINKS!* How many apps are there for this phone?  I don't know. . . perhaps three?  Perhaps not even that many.  You're \"slumming\" with this phone. . .* It's a pain to take the back panel off.  You have to press-in two buttons, but even then the panel does not pop-open.* If you want to open the USB port, you have to take something and \"gouge\" it open.* No touchscreen* As a man with \"normal\" fingers, the keypad is not great.  But then I've never seen one that really was on a phone this size.  Everyone wants tiny phones. . . but then the keys are also tiny.* Have I mentioned that NOTHING is easy about this phone??  It's an entire process you have to go through to do anything on this phone.There is only ONE good thing about this phone.  It looks good.  But otherwise . . . it STINKS!!There is really only one reason that I will probably keep this phone. . . .and it's a really bad reason to keep it. . . but. . . there is a camera on the phone.  My old phone doesn't have a camera, and my old phone is not going to last forever.  So. . .  I'll use this piece-of-junk for just a phone. . . and the camera ability.  Again, fortunately I got it as a \"lightening deal\".  Otherwise I would be returning it.PLEASE do yourself a favor and get an iPhone if you can. .  .if not. . . get an Android phone.  I think you'll be MUCH happier.
