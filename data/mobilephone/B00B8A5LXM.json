T-mobile is now refarming their network and they have included a 1900 MHz band that is the same with AT&T;'s HSPA+/4G. just make sure your APN is set to internet1.voicestream.com or internet2.voicestream.com instead of the epc.tmobile.com and wap.voicestream.com. So T-mobile users can now use ANY unlocked phones from AT&T; or any GSM phone that has 1700/1900/2100 HSPA band!!The phone is awesome!! Sony really makes good product and this one is a steal!! $200 1.5GHz dual core, 12MP camera, 4.55 inch 720p screen, android 4.0.4!! I gave it 4 stars because battery is weak, only last me half a day versus my old Galaxy s 2 works the entire day before dying!!", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "BREED sold a LOCKED phone", "Author": "tylermckee", "ReviewID": "R337PM7EBOS5XM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had purchased this refurbished phone from BREED as a birthday present to me. It was listed as an unlocked phone that was compatible with GSM.  I had received the phone several days later with a separate SIM card purchased.  When I had turned it on it asked for a SIM network unlock PIN.  I had called my provider for said pin and they had told me that they do not offer these codes, because the pin I was asking for was an unlock pin for the phone itself.  For several days now I have been on the phone with BREED and my carrier.  BREED is saying that the phone is unlocked, my carrier disagrees.  The SIM network unlock PIN that my carrier gave me did not work.I would not recommend buying from BREED because they sell locked phones.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product & service", "Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "R3JYMBC6SFJMYL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a used one from Mobile Image & received about 1.5 weeks later.  They are responsive on answering emails.  The product described as no scratches & condition like new.  It came just like it - no scratches, condition like new. However, they shipped me 2 top caps (Xperia has 1 top cap/lid & 1 bottom cap/lid), I asked them to shipped me the bottom one, they did pretty quickly.  Great service.Pros:** Xperia Ion LT28a feels good on hand.  Good body quality made as for all Sonys, sleek & style.  For me, it still looks it can last, looks nicer not cheaply made than other current top smartphones.  Friends who have Samsung S3, their phones already have scratches & look cheap now.  I would say style wise, Xperia is next to iPhone.** Consider it's about a 1-yr old model (release date in US June 2012), it has 4G LTE, is fast, & every app runs smoothly.  I have Straight Talk, unlimited talk/text/web, works great on it.  Icons & desktops don't look as \"richly colored\" like Samsung S3, but if look closely, each icon appears less rough, more delicate & smooth edged.  The texts (compare with same font, same style) look cleaner like it has been carefully designed.  View very clear outdoor using only half brightness (compare to my friend's Samsung S2 Skyrocket needs to turn on full brightness to view outdoor).** Speaker phone is pretty loud (say sitting in the car while others driving).** Pictures quality is great.** Battery life is good for a smartphone.  I think the way they made it viewable under the sun saves battery life.  I play games, talk, web, charge only once a day.Cons:** The 4 soft buttons on the bottom are not too quick responsive like Samsung S3, it requires you to touch it on the right spot, which is ok for me.** AT&T; logo on the top, not so cool, but ok.Note: it uses micro SIM card (15mm x 12mm).", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "defective", "Author": "shaun k.", "ReviewID": "R3KQ2XTGSUESNL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "got this phone from Ross Cellular it does not work phone not picking any mobile network phones say no service", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "it works as it should", "Author": ":3", "ReviewID": "R35HXGZ5JFX8AP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "for being a year old and lightly used... this xperia ion works like a charm, very fast and slick in interface, includes typical connectivity such as wifi b/g/n, bluetooth, micro usb, hdmi, and the like also includes NFC and many other cellular connections such as band 3, and 4(maybe another) LTE(note that at&t; and tmobile typically market 4G on their hspa+ signals and 4G LTE on their respective LTE signals). the touch screen is mostly good, its hit or miss at times with picking up gestures but overall nothing to cry about just make take more suggestion such as pressure or re-try the gesture one or 2 times(total of maybe half a second, not life or death, but coming from a iphone its very noticable). battery life is surprising for being a year old and running last gen Snapdragon S3 processor(only noticeable difference from S3 -S4 is lower power consumption on S4).  i been able to hold a 4 hour call on speakerphone and no charger in sight(iphones all around), and the phone got \"toasty\" but only drained from 80% down to 65%, leaving everyone impressed as well. audio quality overall is enjoyable, audiophiles may be confused but some of additional items in menus such a surround sound modes and only having 8 equalizers and tons of presets.. but i'm kind of a audio nut myself and i can see it as being enjoyable experience for majority of crowd as audio degradation is low.screen quality is amazing at most angles, sharp angles like sideways(and who reads a phone off the edge of the bezel anyway) can cause it to wash out a small amount, but as for using it and having a buddy on either side of you, thx to full 720P display and bravia engine, been very enjoyable, colors very  immersive not over done for majority of things.  camera.  well it is 12 megapixels, 1080P video on rear but if you're looking to replace the 8MP camera in your samsung galaxy S3 or Iphone 4S or 5, this will be a problem when comes to less than average lighting.. outside in daylight this thing makes some seriously gorgeous photos and stable video for average user, and unless you're taking 1080P video to discovery channel on new york city traffic where to focus takes maybe 1/8 of a second to rebound to perfect point again(not noticeable on small display but on full 46 inch tv it is), you will find the camera to be decent but not mindblowing, average users will enjoy it with good lighting(average at least) but will have to ask someone else to snap pix in dark area without flash.call quality well, very enjoyable, full tones, can hear more of the voice and they can hear you very well, the audio suppression system is very good, city traffic at lunch it was like a missile lock onto my voice i was told, very little outside noise, some noticeable traffic noise, but most of it they didn't hear.signal strength is not well represented in terms of bars on status bar, where as i noticed 2 bars = 3 and 1 bar = 2/3 bars.  take that with a grain of caution though. i have not dropped a single call as of yet.  this doesn't mean will be same for everyone else as i have seen first hand with other phones, some can handle a densely packed wooded area in a valley of dead zones, then someone with same phone has no service on same carrier.  just how it is with cellular signal quality from towers. the reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 stars:camera is too good for its own, should be better since it has so much overhead in terms of pixel, 12 million should make low lighting be easily shooting environment, with all that overhead in pixel count for videos, the audio quality.. while very very good, it would fail to satisfy audio nuts and audiophiles, yes, average jane and joe will find it to be amazing stuff and if your average joe and jane, by all means disregard my strike against the audio, you will love it :)and finally the heat issue, i have a temperature monitor on a battery widget and it backs my claims of it getting \"toasty\" up.  average 20 minute call, not enough to warm it up, but a hour + conference call go from room temperature to as high as 114F if you're a heavy multi tasker  and running other apps in background that do not close, suspend but continue to run at full pace.  if you just using it heavily, may see it touch 109F, if you're the average user, moderate checking of emails, and moderate web surfing, and surfing, noticed about 87-95F.  remember that heat is the enemy of the life of devices.and may be important to some: sony has slower then average update process, this will be getting jelly bean soon (4.1) but as for now, most you can enjoy is ice cream sandwich (4.0) until then.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "rosana", "ReviewID": "RPASYZD4BFKGV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "cell equipment is a great product I really like every detail of it, came without any android operating system problem it brings is very good and versatile functions and meets", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "Need 4 Speed", "ReviewID": "R2DI44258F8405", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "User friendly.

I show off to everybody. It says unlocked so hopefully will be easier to use overseas. The pic quality is excellent. I saw other reviews and they said the video is shaky and other flaws, but i decided to purchase anyways. Every time i record something in school my friends loved and put our posts on youtube. The quality is great and not shaky. The voice is clear. The pics are beautiful. The only thing I dont like it is the SMS because u dont have that many choices for different letter styles or color. During a conversation I am always white and I can change the color for the other person BUT the letters are white so in some colors you can not really see, principally if is numbers. Also you can not assign different ring tones for each person for SMS, I hope Sony do something about it. If someone knows how to fix that let me know. But we can not win all. I love the phone in general. The external memory is great.

Granted the processor on the phone is an older s3 snapdragon processor, it was the sony software which made this phone run with some lag. Scrolling through homepages sometimes felt like slow crawl. Updating the software to ice cream sandwhich made the phone alittle faster. The design was nice though with the back having a brushed metal finish and the screen which was 720 x 1280 had the sony bravia engine making the phone one of the best looking screens I have ever seen. Unfortunate this might have been the culprit for why the battery was so terrible. I use my phone a lot at my university, but I don't play games or watch videos that much. I mostly browse the web, check email, text and make phone calls. Mind you I have no 3g or 4g because I am using at&t;'s prepaid plan. So I was completely on wifi the entire time, so no 3g/4g to suck up battery life and this thing would't make it past 5hrs. I don't know I the phone I had received was defective, but the battery was unbearable. So I  unfortunatly returned the phone and in the end bought a nexus 4, which is now the best phone ive ever used.
