It may look good and have a great qwerty keyboard, but it has some serious flaws:* It has NO camera;* It does NOT support 3G;* Texting is difficult. You need to push too many buttons to reply even if you are in the conversation thread already.If you really want a Blackberry, get a newer one. The 8820 may have been good in the past, but not anymore.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bolivia: BLACKBERRY 8820 Smartphone Quadband GSM World Phone (Unlocked)", "Author": "farduz", "ReviewID": "R2S0TVE5SN0341", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice blackberry.

I bought this phone mainly for phone calls and texting. I don't need a fancy phone for apps, because I have an iPad. I got tired of texting without a QWERTY keyboard, so I know this phone will help me a lot. This phone also has very nice address book, calendar, task, note functions you can use to organize your life. I put doctor appointments, library books due dates, birthdays, etc on the calendar and it will remind me at a set time. The wifi works well and I can browse the internet using the browser provided in the phone. No camera, but I knew that before purchasing this phone. It is not an issue for me. I also bought the phone for traveling overseas. Blackberry is very popular in the country I will be going to most. This phone is quite an old model though, so many popular BB apps that work on newer models don't work on this one.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "great!", "Author": "Rahul Sanghi", "ReviewID": "R1G4OMSAUZFI92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product!

In my opinion, this is a phone geared toward business or professional use.  It's one of the few phone without a camera which my be beneficial to certain professionals (e.g., if you are a litigator there is no problem going through court security).  The wi-fi calling is also beneficial.  I find the call quality to be excellent and better than an upgraded Microsoft 3g enabled phone I subsequently received and tried out for a few months.  The features on the 8820 are also easy to access.  I also like the fact that the phone feels very solid and not like a piece of plastic.  The speaker-phone is excellent.  I have owned my phone for approximately 2 years now.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blackberry 8820", "Author": "Dahliarose", "ReviewID": "R354P9HGNPOLYY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I Love it!!
