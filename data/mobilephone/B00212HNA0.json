{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A smartphone phone with a good price", "Author": "Wlake", "ReviewID": "R1ANM3DFE5BUM7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone (blue E63-2) three weeks ago. Overall, I am very happy with this phone. $200 for this unlocked smartphone is a great deal.I add my application background first in the following. Because I think a review will only be fair with certain application background. For example, for the email application, Blackberry is more powerful for the business user, it can have more functions or better performance when it is hooked up with your company exchange server. Also for data service performance in wireless network, I only use it in T-mobile network; I don't know how it performs in ATT's 3G network, so I don't comment on this.My service provider: T-mobileMy service package: voice + 100MB/month data serviceMy application: personal usePro:1. Full Q keyboard. Yes, a lot of smartphones have the full Q-keyboard. But the keyboard of E63 has the better design, the shape of each key enables you to type with less error-stroking.2. WI-FI: 802.11g compatible. The setup is very easy, it supports WEP/WPA/WPA2 wireless security features. And the link speed is very good. This enable me to go to internet and download applications at home (or hot-spot) without using the 100MB data-service bandwidth.3. When the \"bluetooth\" and the \"WLAN scanning\" are turned off, the battery life is GOOD; thanks to the physical size of the battery. When the \"WLAN scanning\" is off, you still can use the WLANs that have already been setup in the phone; it just won't search for the new WLAN. But for the \"bluetooth\", you will have to turn it on in order to use it; and the \"bluetooth\" seems draining more power than WIFI.4. Email service: I am using Nokia's free (for now) mail push service; it pushes my yahoo mails and the other mails to my E63, it notifies me when there is a new mail. Most time, it worked very quickly in T-mobile network (but my emails are more text oriented, HTML contents require additional download time). This is a great feature, I don't have to go to the internet to fetch the mails manually. One can download this email setup software from Nokia website. This is only available for BlackBerry and iPhone before, with a more expensive data service.  (I don't know when Nokia will start to charge this service.)5. Completed PDA functions and reliable sync with PC (Syncing with PC by bluetooth is great!)6. Compare with the Nokia E71, I like this one better. The reasons are: lower-price and thicker body with plastic finishing. Although the body of E63 is plastic, but the texture feels very good and not easy to get the finger-prints. The thicker body has the acoustic advantage, the speaker performances well even when you are listening music. Of course, the lower price comes with the trade-offs: comparing with E71, the E63 does not have integrated GPS and the resolution of the camera is lower (3mp via 2mp)7. Music function: E63 has the 3.5 mm standard connector, which means you can use your favorite headset to listen to music. Although, the headset comes with the phone is stereo, and it has an in-line microphone; but the frequency response is not good enough to listen to music (if you are serious about listening). By using a standard headset, you still can make calls or receive calls, but you will have to speak to the microphone in the phone.Con:1. Image quality of camera. I can live with the 2MP resolution, but the noise of the camera is too obvious; even the pictures taken outdoor.2. Micro-USB cable is not included: This phone uses the Micro-USB interface, which is smaller than the mini-USB. I am sure most people have one or more mini-USB cables, which is widely used. But a lot of people don't have the micro-USB cable, at least I don't. So I have to go to a local shop to buy one ($15), and it is not easy to found one too. Very unfortunate, Nokia did not throw one in the box. Sometimes, it is very useful, such as when you want to copy a hundred songs to your phone's memory card; bluetooth is simply too slow to do this task.Update:Here is the update after three month use.(A) Don't put this phone into a case that is too tight; especially: preventing the keyboard to be touched when it is in the case. I found out if the keyboard is being touched, the phone will not go into the sleep mode and the battery runs out really fast.(B) The IP phone function(aka Internet phone) is great for the international long distant call (you must sign-up the \"Gizemo\" first), you can use it whenever you have the WIFI access; it cost much less than your wireless service provider's international plan. But after you finish a call, you should disconnect the phone from the WIFI completely; otherwise the battery goes down real quick. The reason is: as soon as you connect the IP phone service, it will contact the WIFI access point (such as your wireless router) periodically even when you are not making calls, this activity will use a lot of power.(C) The \"Remote lock\" is a great feature, and it is very easy to setup. First, you need to setup the \"lock code\" of this phone (after setup, write it down). Then enable the \"Allow Remote lock\" feature, it will ask a lock code again; it can be the same code in the FIRST step or a different one. If you lost your phone or simply forget your phone in the office; just grab another phone and send a text message to your phone, the message is the lock code. The message must contain the exactly same lock code, case must be matched and no extra space. Use another phone to send a text message is the best way to do it; some computer programs can send a text message to a wireless phone, but it tends to add some extra text in the message automatically, this will fail to lock the phone.", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great, Best Bargain out there!", "Author": "Caveman017", "ReviewID": "RGQBA1HGWZ3AA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to start off saying that after using multiple phones over the years, I find this to be one of my top phones I have ever used.By being unlocked from the start, the phone is completely umbranded, meaning you don't have all of the cute AT&T; or T-Mobile logos everywhere, and have complete access to all of the settings that most providers will restrict you from changing. You also have 110MB of space free on the phone (a ton) for basic apps, and of course you can buy a MicroSD card for even more memory.The phone itself looks great. The blue color is actually an extremely dark navy, and can look black in most cases. As for the thickness compared to the e71, I think it actually feels better in your hand, and isn't that noticeable. The headphone jack is a great touch, allowing you to use any headphone set you want.As for the software, it uses the Symbian 9.2 Feature Pack 1, and includes software you can use to open and edit Word and Excel documents on the go. The built in music player is decent, and set up like an Ipod with its ability to have playlists, genre searches etc. You can even download the free Divx player and watch movies to go! Then theres the Nokia Ovi store. Sort of like the App Store for the iPone, you can download apps directly from Nokia, although at the moment due to its recent launch, there aren't that many things (especially free) being offered.The WiFi was the deal sealer for me. Living on a college campus which has wireless internet all over, I didn't want to have to pay to have internet and email on my phone. Its fast (compared to a friend's iPone, about the same speed)and it is great for surfing, along with using the build-in YouTube application.There is a ton of great free software on the web for the phone if you look for it, things like weather applications, instant messaging, mapping software (requires either a WiFi or a data plan to use) etc.I find the speakerphone loud and clear, and good enough to play music over.The keyboard is absolutely amazing. I haven't experience many misspellings while using it, compared to my past palm treo I had. The keys are comfortable and easy to press down.Battery life is great on this. I was able to get 5 days out of a charge with light usage (30 texts per day, maybe 20 minutes on the phone per day and 10-15 minutes per day surfing using the WiFi)The cons I've found:Nokia still hasn't set up a threaded text messaging system as default (IM style chats). My Windows Mobile phone from 4 years ago has this feature, and Nokia has their own application which does this, but you cannot set it as the default Txt messaging.Weak vibration feature. I can barley feel it. My previous Nokia was weak as well though.The Operating System (Symbian) does not assume or remember any connection settings. If you open your web browser, each time it will ask you what connection you want to use. It can get annoying if you are constantly in the same place.Other Tips I've foundIf you don't have a data plan, go into the Network settings and change it to be GSM Only (NOT UMTS). UMTS is 3G, and you will get better battery life using GSM only with no downsides if not using the data plan.To change volume with internet radio, press the function key, and then the up and down keys change the volume.In media player, you can start typing the name of a song or artist using the keyboard and it will show up.", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great unlocked smartphone for the price!", "Author": "alexakajojo", "ReviewID": "R23H5TX7Z9X97X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the E63-2 (North American Version) for a few days now, and am really loving this phone so far.  It's my first Symbian (S60) phone, so I was a little hesitant about the learning curve.  And to be honest -- it's not anywhere near as intuitive as the iPhone or Android.  But if you're a little bit tech savvy, it won't be a problem at all.The phone feels great in hand.  I've held the E63's big brother, the E71, and I prefer this one better.  The rubberized plastic doesn't feel cheap at all, offers a superior grip, and maybe best of all, doesn't get all smudged up with fingerprints.  It's still relatively slim, though not as sleek as the E71.  But again, I prefer it -- it's just easier to hold.The QWERTY is nicely designed, and the keys feel great to push.  Numerically, the \"0\" is to the right of the \"9\" instead of underneath the \"8,\" which is kind of jarring at first, but I got used to it.  Another design annoyance is the lack of a volume rocker on the side... you have to use the D-Pad, which means taking the phone away from your ear mid-conversation.  No dedicated camera button either, but that didn't bother me much at all -- you can take a picture in two button clicks away from the home screen.Voice quality is crystal-clear, rivaling any land-line I've ever used.  The ringer's nice and loud, though getting to the Sound settings themselves require a series of button pushes, instead of being \"right there.\"The default mail client is decent, though I've run into some problems connecting to my ISP's POP3 mail server.  I downloaded Nokia's new mail client, which is a lot more graceful.There are lots of apps available on the internet for this operating system, but they're scattered all over the place and they're hard to find unless you really know what you're looking for.  However, that's going to change very soon, as Nokia's \"Ovi Store\" is set to open next month (May 2009).  Looks very promising -- and even appears to have the elusive S60 Facebook app that's been conspicuous in its absence.Anyway, great UNLOCKED smartphone for the price.  Might be lacking in some minor areas (no GPS, average camera quality, no volume rocker), but it makes up for it in others (WiFi, stable operating system, app store coming soon).Strong recommendation from me.", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "E63 - Best phone for the money! AAA+++", "Author": "Jim Francis \"Jim Francis\"", "ReviewID": "R21G1AFHV4DLQV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to \"upgrade\" from my old N95 (had it 2 or 3 years)and get a phone with full qwerty keyboard. Using Nokia's \"Switch\" utility, all my contacts were transfered to my new E63 within minutes... It was effortless... Thank you Nokia!TV SCREEN: The E63 screen is brighter, wider and better proportioned than the N95. Great for watching TV - yes, there's a $15 TV application that gives you CNN and about 100 other channels - Google \"Spb TV\"SPEED: It's much faster and more streamlined than the N95 - maybe the E63 has a faster processor?FAST CAMERA: REALLY FAST! It boots up in about one second so it's much easier to point and shoot than the N95. 2.0 Megapixels isn't a problem - I prefer the lower resolution because it's much easier to email and share the pics on the net.PRIUS BLUETOOTH INTEGRATION: Bluetooth transfered ALL my 170 contacts to the Toyota's Address Book in one shot. The N95 couldn't do that!INTERNET MODEM: Works flawlessly... Nokia PC Suite allows me to connect my notebook to the internet anytime by just plugging the phone into its USB port and clicking a button. T-Mobile gives me unlimited access to the Internet for just $20/month.BATTERY: E63's battery is huge - about twice the size of the N95's - without making the phone more bulky - amazing. The E63 easily lasts far longer than the N95 without re-charging.VOLUME CONTROL: There's no physical volume control buttons on the E63. Instead, you use the central cursor control (during a call) and it works just fine. Honestly, who actually alters the volume of each call? I set the volume once and it normally stays at that level for all my calls - I don't miss having a separate volume control. Good job NOKIA!GMAIL: Nokia's combined email/message application works better than Google's own separate Gmail application. Setup was easy and Nokia integrates a Gmail inbox alert into the phone's main screen.BLUETOOTH TIP: Quickly turn on/off Bluetooth by pressing and holding the asterisk key * for a couple of seconds (from the main screen). Great for when you're in the car with passengers but don't want them listening to your \"hands free\" conversations.PRICE: You just can't beat it - there's NOTHING that comes close. You'll also need to order a Nokia USB cable (about $2 on Amazon) and why not treat yourself to an 8GB Micro SDHC card? (about $20).NOKIA E63 ROCKS!!!

This phone is an EU phone that is being offered here in the US to gain market share and put the phone in the hands of the more casual user.  Go ahead, go to CNET and PCworld and check out the reviews; the E63 is typically compared with units costing 2-3 times as much.  So, it falls a bit short in some areas (camera, headphones, et al) so, it's not perfect.  For under $200, who cares?  Come on.  All current phones are obsolete in three years anyway, (or after the first drop on the airport floor)!The E63's got a vivid screen, great speaker, gets FM radio, a decent app store @ NOKIA.com, MicroSD slot, easy to sync up, great build quality and offers clear reception for TMobile, ATT and international travel, whenever we decide to do that again.  QKeyboard, ability to netsurf in hotspots w/o dataplan, US WARRANTY and by the way, currently less than $150 beans with rebate.  And no two-year contract.

So, if you have ATT HSDPA in your area you will not be able to take advantage of it, max download speeds 90% lower than the E71-2.

However, after seeing this phone on Amazon, along with many positive reviews and an excellent price ($150 after rebate), this phone looked to have the right price and features for my needs. In particular, I wanted strong messaging capabilities, WiFi, a few games, and reasonably capable web browsing to check the news, my RSS feeds, weather, stocks, etc. However, I really don't need (or want to pay for) the more advanced iPhone capabilities.I've had the phone for just over 2 days now, and my experience has been consistent with many of the other reviewers. For example, I really like the keyboard and overall construction and form-factor. The core applications like email, web browsing, calendar, and address book also meet or exceed my expectations. However, I found parts of the setup and configuration to be counter-intuitive and the software and handset as a whole to be less \"seamlessly integrated\" than I would have hoped for.The above being said, now that I've fully configured this phone, and I'm further along the Symbian learning curve, I believe for as long as I own this phone, it will prove to be an excellent value; i.e., it has excellent features, capabilities, and performance for the price.A few specific pros and cons include:* \"Virtual GPS\" with Google maps - If you purchase this phone, I'd definitely download Google Maps. Having done so, I was pleasantly surprised to find Google Maps used the cell-tower method to give a \"virtual GPS\" location within 200 meters (at least for me on AT&T;), and fully integrated this information with its other capabilities.* Software and handset capabilities not seamlessly integrated - For example, I purchased a 4GB mini-SD card, and proceeded to fill it with hundreds of photos in numerous folders. By default, the built in photo browser doesn't include the folder structure on the SD card, but instead lists all the photos as one big flat list. There is a work-around to organize the pictures into a second set of \"folders\" on the phone, but why is this duplicate organization necessary? There are also 3rd party photo browsers you can download/purchase. As another example, I configured the start-up screen to show some contact information to call if someone finds my lost phone, but also configured the phone with a lock code; however, the phone only displays the startup splash screen *after* the lock code has been successfully entered, sort of defeating the value of my \"if found\" splash screen. In general, many of the features and capabilities on this phone work very well individually, but there's room for improvement to make all these features integrate more smoothly with respect to the likely workflow of a person using the phone.* Email setup was a snap - When I started using the phone, it prompted me with a step-by-step (wizard based) configuration of email. In a few steps, the phone was properly configured for my gmail account. However, in the future, using email as a representative example, I'd suggest Nokia put more effort to simplify/automate common tasks in the initial setup process, such as pairing with my bluetooth headset, or specifying predictive or non-predictive text entry.* Awkward Connection Management - Most of the built in applications have a choice to always connect to a specific WiFi/3G/Edge connection, or to always choose a connection during startup - Wouldn't it have been simpler to specify a prioritized list of connections to try, such as your home WiFi first, then 3G?* Lots of keyboard shortcuts - I'm still learning many of the keyboard shortcuts, such as pressing and holding the \"Home\" button to display a list of open applications, pressing and holding the email button to start a new email, or pressing and holding the calendar button to enter a new meeting. While there's a learning curve, I'm appreciating the added efficiency of these shortcuts.* Works well with iSync - Being a Mac user, I downloaded the iSync plugin. So far, I've found iSync does a job synchronizing the phone with my local iCal calendar and Mac address book.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Powerful and Robust Smartphone with Unrivaled Features", "Author": "John \"alphajc\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZETK4RHL7C9O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "6 Month Review - Update (12/21/09)I've had this phone for just about 6 mos now and now I'm ready to write a final review.There are plenty of comprehensive reviews already on the internet for this phone, so I am going to give a short and sweet real-life review of this phone about things care about the most:Reception:  My old phone had 0-3 bars throughout my house with frequent dropped calls.  This phone has 4-5 bars constantly and never drops a call (both with same carrier).  Nokia phones are rightfully famous for having the best reception and you will not have reception problems as long as coverage is available in your area.  AT&T; doesn't have the best reception everywhere and don't blame the phone but the carrier if you aren't getting reception.  AT&T; suffers badly underground, between lots of tall buildings and in many rural areas.Battery Life:  If you are playing music, watching movies, using data/bluetooth, and other battery draining tasks...don't expect for it to last more than 3-4 hours.  But if you do some data, some multimedia, some texting and about an hour of voice a day...the battery can last about 3 days.  If you are a casual user, it can last you a week.  Spare batteries are about $15 on ebay, just buy an extra one and swap out when needed.  Additional travel and car chargers are awfully cheap too...around $5.  Even though the battery cell is made in china, it is high quality.Software:  Symbian S60 interface isn't the best, but it's powerful and you have good multi-tasking capabilities, unlike many other smartphones.  There are lots of apps out there, although not may too many good free ones.  Nokia's Ovi App Store is live now and this phone connects to it just fine.  Recently a Facebook app became available (a lot worse than iphone version), still no Yelp app, and no official Twitter app (but the freeware TweetS60 and other not-free apps like Twibble are nice).  It comes with just Tiger Woods Golf for gaming but many Soduku, Bejeweled, Chess, etc games are available.The built-in browser leaves a lot of features to be desired (but it is a full web browser) but pages that don't work so well, works fine in Opera Mini or Mobile.  A limited version of Flash is included.Keyboard/Features:  The keyboard (also found on the E71) is the best among all smartphones IMO.  I've used the Blackberry Curve 8900, and this Nokia phone is much easier to type on.  It's predictive text feature makes sending e-mails a cinch and the Push e-mail works well with gmail and hotmail.  This phone lacks GPS, but A-GPS through Google Maps is adequate for most.Screen:  Not quite as good as the Blackberry Curve 8900, but still great.  Display is crisp for all uses and Youtube videos come out respectfully.  Hopefully Nokia soon offers OLED models.Etc:  Wi-Fi works great (far better wi-fi reception than the Curve 8900), this phone supports AT&T; 3G (Curve 8900 only supports EDGE) and downloads are speedy on both.  It does not support 3.5G that the Nokia E71x and Blackberry Bold supports.What is Bad?:  Phone occasionally crashes and reboots (largely fixed with newer firmware), built-in camera is lousy in quality but functional, no side volume control button, Lack of free apps available on Nokia Ovi Store.  Lot of people have said Nokia tech support sucks, but I have never needed to call or write them.This phone is A-Okay!The recently available 4.0 firmware upgrade adds a brand new version of Nokia Mail (which makes it much more comparable to blackberry e-mail), and comes with Chat (which allows you to use Google Chat, Ovi Chat, MSN Messaging and Yahoo IM (but no AOL Instant Messenger).  Push e-mail can be spotty at times (but mostly due to AT&T; Packet Data dying from time to time).  This firmware has also resolved most issues with phone freezing or rebooting by itself and works faster.  Recent updates to Google Maps and Opera Mini will enhance the device's capabilities.  Nokia is good about upgrading firmware periodically.  Unlike iPhone, upgrading the firmware will delete your entire phone, so you do need to do a complete back-up.", "Date": "May 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "AMAZING PHONE! POWER USER HERE", "Author": "Bryan B. Millares \"estooie\"", "ReviewID": "R3MOMF63YFS7QM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for almost two weeks now, and I'm loving it! I came from an iPhone 3G, then a Moto Q9h, and now to this. So far it gives me what I really want from a phone, VERSATILITY! I mean, I love to customize my phone to work FOR me, not the other way around.I loved my iPhone, but the lack of multi-tasking hampered me, and the data plan from my carrier was $30/mo. The Moto Q9h has all the features, but WM 6.1 is what it is, Windows Mobile. It tended to freeze and require at least one or two soft resets a day.This isn't my first Symbian phone, so I knew what I was walking into with the OS. What amazed me was the speed. This has got to be one of the most responsive OS UI's ever implemented, especially for a Nokia!

The keyboard takes a few days to get used to. The keyboard shortcuts are great, and I really dig that this model has a dedicated \"Ctrl\" key. The preset buttons for Calendar, Contacts, and Messaging can be remapped to what you want them to do. The screen had me worried because I didn't know if it was made of a scratch-resistant material. The OtterBox case comes with a thick screen protector, so that solves that.In a nutshell... Snappy performance, fully customizable, mp3 and video ringtones (not kidding), good signal, doesn't need the more expensive data plan from At&t;, when a program were to freeze just hold the home key (task manager) and close it from there (doesn't usually happen), and it's great for multitasking!", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Basic Smartphone", "Author": "Steven R.

UPS Delivery UNSATISFACTORY", "Author": "Dyeyk L. \"Dyeyk\"", "ReviewID": "R1F5Z8AXSS1WS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nokia E63-2 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Full U.S. Warranty (Ultramarine Blue)I just got this phone a week ago 07/01/2009.  All prior reviews were right on the money.  This phone is truly a quality product.  I just want to comment on 2 cool features and its practical application that no one yet has mentioned as follows:1. All songs and/or any other sound bite you upload to the phone or micro SD card (including the ones you recorded using the phone's recorder) can be used as ring tones - FREE OF CHARGE.  My sons tell me they have to buy ring tones for their iPhones at $1 each song and a buck more to crop a 30-second ring tone out of the entire song.2. You know how these big companies record conversations between customer service agents and customers for \"training and quality assurance purposes\", and days later could not refer back to a playback of the recorded conversation to settle an issue/dispute ... well, with my trusty Nokia E63-2, I can now use its recorder to record all customer service phone interactions I will have.  And I will let them know it \"to ensure you satisfy my needs as your customer and get assurance that you will do whatever we agree on to make things right\".  So now, if these companies can't produce their recordings for whatever reason, I'd just play mine for their listening pleasure.I gave this phone a 5-star rating as it met, and even exceeded, all the functional requirements I predefined as part of my smart phone selection process.I'm also happy with the usual professional order processing and prompt hand-over of the package to the courier administered by Amazon.com.I wish I could say the same thing about UPS as far as this delivery is concerned.  While the UPS driver did deliver the package on time (2-day shipping/\"2nd Day Air\"), I found the package inside my backyard right beside our locked 6-foot metal sheet gate and hollow block fencing alongside the alley.  This begs the question on how the package got over the 6-foot gate and fencing.  I can't help but think the cellphone (with all the sensitive electronics in it) that I bought just got dropped from 6 feet in the air onto the concrete floor.I just wished the UPS delivery person who walked 15+ paces from the curb to my rear gate took a short-cut to my front door (which is just 10 steps from the curb) where I would have received and signed for the package, and thanked him for the prompt yet careful handling and delivery of my package.Nevertheless, the phone seems to be working fine having tested most of its features.  I hope I don't need to return it because of any future malfunction or internal damage that's plausible considering the way it was handled/delivered.Amazon.com is my preferred online source for quality products.  I hope it also tracks performance and complaints about its designated couriers to ensure end-to-end customer satisfaction.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome for texting and Hulu", "Author": "Tony Yu \"68P, Hooah.\"", "ReviewID": "RKHOHS7L7TR6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got it a few days ago.

This unit offers FREE push e-mail which is exactly like blackberry phones except...FREE.*Mobbler works on this phone and is very close to Pandora Radio.*This phone plays flash very well. So, youtube, hulu, etc etc runs pretty smoothly. It doesn't always play perfectly (without a little skipping) but works well.* Features it gained vs the Nokia e71: A flashlight (the led for the camera) button, which comes on by pressing spacebar on the phone, a backslash button, 3.5 mm jack for music(the gym).*Features it lost vs the Nokia e71: NO side buttons for volume control, 0.1 inches thicker, no GPS, no HSDPA, no case.In closing, unless you need GPS, HSDPA, or a fake leather case, GET THIS PHONE.", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "best phone for the price", "Author": "D.

I initially bought the iPhone to use as my work phone since my company uses AT&T.; I loved the iPhone as a gadget since I am always an apple fan. However, the device has lots of issues from a business user's perspective. My main complain was the flimsy alarms for meetings. There is no way you can customize the alert tones in that phone. HTC hero is a very new product that I use for my personal use from Sprint. I like the device but the bluetooth sucks on this device. I paired it with my car's hands free connection, and the hero stopped connecting to the car from the next use. I think Sprint needs a major bug fix on the bluetooth area of this device. With all said, the e63 keeps making me happy. i love the utility of this device. I do not have a data plan since my company uses text messages for paging since it is cheaper than blackberry service. This has not been an issue since I have wifi on this phone. The bluetooth stereo works seamlessly with my car. the call and signal quality is perfect. I can synch the phone with both my outlook at work and my music on iTunes on an iMac at home. it even transfers the new podcasts. I have a 2 GB card in this phone. This is more than enough for my use as I only have a hundred or so songs that i listen to. I listen to a lot of financial and news podcasts. To make things more sweeter, the music transfer is possible over bluetooth. Apple does not allow that even on their own iPhone from a mac. Don't get me wrong, I love the macs, but I think Apple does not know how to make a perfect phone yet. They still need to learn a lot from an experienced phone maker like Nokia. My specific unit was manufactured in Finland. Has an excellent workmanship on the product. The keys are smooth. Much better than the virtual keyboard that iPhone or the hero sports. The device has a substantial feeling as not too light and not too bulky.

If you disagree and has a better mobile phone in mind, feel free to comment and rebuke! :)Do not be fooled by the pictures and videos. They cannot do this phone justice. The camera adds 5 pounds to the phone! ;p But the phone feels actually very compact in my hands, with a very nice grip because of the rubbery back. It feels quite sturdy in spite of the plastic construction.The Ultramarine Blue is SEXY. It is very subtle and looks almost onyx at a certain angle, while at other angles it is actually shiny and stylish (thanks to the large 2.4' screen and the metal direction pad).The important thing is, if you think this phone may be too bulky for you, you need to actually see it and feel it in your hands to feel its efficient design.Good:- uber large battery (I can go on about 4 days without charging, and that is with about everyday use of 30 text, an hour of music playing, web browsing, youtube, email, few calls etc)- Functionality - does everything: mp3 (3.5mm standard jack), video, email, bluetooth, etc.- Expandability - S60 V3 FP2 is very nice and is supported by a large pool of freeware (much much more than iphone apps)- Full QWERTY - took me a few days of texting to get used to, but the Predictive learns very quickly, and if I hit one or two wrong letters, it'll automatically correct me and give me a list of what it thinks is what I intended to type.- Solid construction - feels like it will last for a long time- Keys feel very good and easy to press- Business ready - very good multi-email account management/sync, contacts, PIM,etc- Wi-Fi is very fast and handy. I can stream youtube videos all day- Fast processor, multitasking is much faster than Windows Mobile devices---------------------------Now you need to be realistic and know that when you buy a unlocked phone for $150, you aren't gonna get a 8MP camera, or 3G, or GPS, or touchscreen (I sold my 5800 for this cuz I hate touchscreen). But those are all that you are missing from a power house like the N96, and the features on this phone rivals or even beat some of the more expensive unlocked phones out there.One thing I love about this phone is that I can just hold space key, and the camera flash will light up as a flash light! That's the kind of usability I am talking about.If you need an unlocked phone, this is a no brainer. You got the most widely used and customizable smart-phone platform out there (Symbian S60), you got a nice full QWERTY for text-maniacs, a full-featured music player with 3.5mm jack, camera with flash and self-portrait, bluetooth, Wi-Fi.

Previously I owned an SE P1i --> Nokia N82 --> E63.  I chose the e63 because I am a heavy texter and the n82 T9 just wasn't cutting it.  I looked at the e71 but since I am on t-mobile and already have an external gps I opted against it (although I still think it is a much nicer phone!).Anyway, having used 2 different symbian s60 devices I can say that the e63 is much improved over the n82 in many ways.  For starters everything on the e63 just seems snappier.  For some reason even though the n82 has a faster processor it is much slower.Secondly the build quality on the E-series is so much better than the N series.  I have seen several E series and N series phones and the E series always feels much more solid.  The n82 which was around $300 when I bought it had such poor build quality I almost returned it.  Although this may not matter...my E63 was built in finland while my n82 was built in china.  The keyboard on the E63 is good but not great.The keyboard on the p1i (which is the best I have ever used on a candy bar) is light years ahead of the E63 but then again i think that the E63 is light years ahead of the palm treo so take it as you will.  The thing that I don't like about the E63 keyboard is that it is a little \"soft\".  i like my keys nice and clicky so that I know when I've pressed them.Software on the E63 is really solid.  Everything \"just works\".  The menu system on all symbian systems is a little confusing though and will take a while to get used to.  Its a little annoying to have to break out the instruction manual to look up something but I'll live with it.All in all this is a ridiculous deal for a phone that costs less than many carrier subsidized phones.  If you are looking for a smartphone and don't need 3g or gps I think it would be hard to find a better phone than the e63.  Really.

But I also wanted to get fee-free navigation and only Nokia offers downloadable maps. On the paper it seemed to have clear advantage over Google Maps, but for practical usability Nokia Maps are light-years behind Google's. Setting way-points is cumbersome, saving the directions list is not possible (at least i have not found it in 2 months) so once you view the directions and want to return to the map the route disappears, the location names (cities, road numbers etc) show up only at close zoom making visual navigation like one would do with a paper map rather cumbersome, searching for addresses and businesses usually does not find anything. In all, I have not been able to use the Nokia Maps in any practical navigation situation. It only works when you have plenty of time and can sit on a sofa and patiently jump through the hoops that Nokia has decided to lay on your path. Google Maps, on the other hand has been very intuitive, it shows more information at lower zoom levels and allows switching between text directions and map view without losing either.For all the other features and capabilities - like e-mail, calendar and contact sync, downloadable applications (Skype!), office capabilities (although not quite smooth yet) and all the other extras - I think E63 is more than worth its cost. It's a solid performer. But the maps, which was one of the main deciding points for me, it's a big flop.Another thing that disappoints me is that the sound quality for phone calls is poor. My 6030 was definitely a lower-end phone but its voice quality was much better than the E63's. Radio and music playback are fine, so I guess it has to do with cell signal processing.

It had the same features as the BB 8520 minus the touchpad.I purchased this phone and after receiving it in 2 days I went to the at&t; store to purchase a SIM card. I bought a 25cent per min. prepaid card and activated 200 messages for $5. (There are other pacages including unlimited messaging.)I was surprised by the number of apps for an OS i had never heard of. The Ovi store by Nokia had many, but the internet had more Symbian OS apps.Here are the Most useful apps not included. (free)1. Skype MobileSkype Mobile offers all the features of Skype on Your phone. This includes SkypeIn and SkypeOut. SkypeIn allows you to purchase an online number so anybody cann call your skype account. SkypeOut allows You to call anybody. Together these only cost $5.5 per month and they give you unlimited minutes(In a wifi area or with Carrier Data) It can also be used anywhere in the world.Let's say I'm located in Omaha with a 402 area code. My friends all live in Omaha and can call me on that number for free. I'm going on a business trip to Shanghai and the international rates are too high. When I open Skype on my phone my family and friends can call my Skype 402 number for free and I'll pick up in China for free also. (very useful)2.Google AppThe google app package for mobile gives you an app that searches google by voice or text. It comes with Youtube, orcut, picassa and best of all Google Maps.Google Maps allows your to use google maps anywhere(in wifi zones or with carrier data) You can press 0 and the map will center on where you are located based on  mobile tower triangulation(similar to GPS)or using wifi triangulation. It is usually accurate within 300meters and is very useful. If you have a google account you can use latitude. Latitude uses your location to tell your friends using latitude where you are. This means if your best friend is at Walmart you can see this and meet him there. There are settings if you don't want to be found. If your mom wants to see where you are, but doesn't have google on her phone, she can get latitude for her igoogle account.3. Opera Mobile BrowserOpera Mobile is a browser that can display webpages as they are displayed on a computer. It boasts tabbed browsing and multiple settings. The Beta VErsion comes with Asian Language Support meaning you can read Chinese characters and other Asian languages.The apps preloaded are useful too. Nokia messaging email is perhaps the most useful. It has the ability to check up to 10 mailboxes for mail all in one app. That way you can check your home and work email together easily.The phone its self is good. The battery life is O.K. The flash for the camera is very useful. The phone can run multiple apps simultaneously. Some people have complained about their phone restarting randomly. This happened a few times, but i think it is because of the RAM being overloaded.The homescreen is very well organized and you can have two separate homescreens (work and Personal) using the switchmode button.Because this phone is unlocked you can use it with any SIM card. That means I can use my at&t; card in Omaha, my t-mobile card in Detroit and my China mobile card in Shanghai and Beijing. The great thing is that when i got china and get a new SIM card, i can keep all my contacts on my phone so i can call home.Overall this phone is a very good smartphone for the money.

It works well with ATT 3G internet.  The browser is acceptable and there are 3rd party free browsers such as opera and skyfire that work well on some websites.  The ovi applications store has a few applications worth mentioning (apart from all the crap) one of which is nimbuzz, an application that allows voip calls using skype. (whether AT&T; would find that objectionable or not is a separate matter.)The phone is really sturdy.  It has seen much abuse at the hands of my kids but has never given me any trouble.  I think its drool-proof and handles drops of up to 4 feet to concrete rather well ;).The phone can find Wireless signals as well as any laptop computer and I have never had trouble with it.  However the Wlan offerred by optimum in some metro areas does not seem to work on this phone.  I suspect that is because of the limited capabilities of the browser.One drawback with the phone is its inability to switch off radio like an iphone or BB.  I would like to have that option especially when you are roaming. However the phone does have an option to ask for permission to connect to an access point, which allows users to select between using a 3g connection or a Wlan.  This is a little cumbersome however.Although this phone does not have integrated GPS, the AGPS functionality seems to work with google maps.  Nokia Maps is horrible to navigate, but I am sure if you are stuck without data somewhere you will find a way to use it under desparate cicumstances.  (you have to download nokia maps)Mail applications work well and the mail application is able to display most content using the html browser.  IMO the phone is better than BB or iphone as it comes preinstalled with quick office applications and can also display pdf files.  However the ability to select text and copy/past text is minimal at best.

Because it is unlocked, NO crippling T-Mobile software limitations and NO 2-YEAR contract!  PLUS, instead of having to pay the (outrageous) $24.99 monthly internet access plan required of any \"smart-Phone\" purchased from T-mobile, I only have to pay $10.00 a month for unlimited access to the web!  For me, the \"EDGE\" network is sufficient, but it would have been even better had the phone been able to access T-Mobile's 3G network (supposedly, E63 can access AT&T;'s 3G), can't ask too much from an unlocked phone that costs only $149 and a data plan that is only 10 bucks a month I suppose...  ;)Best Apps - Google Maps and Skyfire, must have's!Google Maps alone is practically worth $10 a month.  I love the \"Show Traffic\" and Streetview features!  And though it is not GPS equipped and won't give you turn by turn instructions, it does a good job of triangulating/estimating your location from the cell towers, so you can use Google Maps to effectively search for things near you.Skyfire - Version 1.5 was just made available, and this app works great at rendering most any webpage as you would see it on your computer, no more \"mobile\" versions of webpages!  Youtube even looks better on the phone than the YouTube app itself, videos are often choppy though if you're not on WLAN/Wi-Fi.Quirks:1) No dedicated volume buttons/rocker - quickfix, just push the function key (key in the bottom left corner used to access numbers/unlock phone etc) and then toggle up or down using the center select key.  I was frustrated at first when I was on a webpage and couldn't figure out how to change the volume, then I finally learned from another forum.2) Need to use Nokia's Ovi music software to transfer .mp3 files onto your SD card.  When I transferred my SIM card and SD Card from my old regular Nokia phone, I freaked out when my music files just would not show up on the phone.  It took me a couple of days to figure out what to do.3) Even if you're upgrading from an old Nokia phone, be patient in figuring out the User Interface / Menu format, not quite as intuitive as simpler Nokia phones, but once you get the hang of it, it's fine.Overall, great value!  Reasons I knocked it down to 4-Stars, no T-Mobile 3G access, and volume levels could be a little higher, but not a deal breaker.  After 1 year, the savings from not having to pay the $24.99 smartphone internet plan will pay for the phone ($15 monthly savings x 12 = $180)Final Note: Best protection I've found is the OtterBox Impact Series silicone skin, highly recommended.

It makes it look professional and less of a \"candy bar.\" The whole exterior casing of the phone is soft and siliconed, unlike Nokia's E71's metal casing. In terms of thickness, sure, the E63 model is slightly thicker than E71.FeaturesThis phone lacks an internal GPS, has a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack, has an ambient light sensor (turns on keyboard light when lighting is dim/dark), has a voice recorder, calendar, Wi-fi capable, and lacks a volume rocker control on the side. It would have been great if you can control the volume without entering through the menu on the phone.FunctionalityLike all smartphones, it has a full QWERTY keyboard and the keys feel just right when pressed (keys are raised with hard texture), although the space bar is quite small. What's so great about this E series is that it is cheaper than the E71 and offers similar functionality (sans the GPS) of the E71.Currently, the purchase of this phone includes Nokia Mail (a free service), which is similar to Blackberry Mail where mail is pushed directly to the phone within minutes of receiving new mail). Setup for mail works flawlessly with Gmail and other 3rd party IMAP accounts. However, the phone came with the old version of Nokia Mail (doesn't download whole email messages automatically; only fetches mail headers), so you will need to manually download the new version of Nokia Mail in the OVI store.ApplicationsThe Novia OVI store is accessible for this phone and you can download free apps and purchase premium apps conveniently on your phone.

It takes decent pics but does not compare to a real camera or a camera phone. Plays most music and video formats but does not handle WMV. Email is a snap to set up, supports hotmail, gmail and yahoo mail with out you having to know anything other than your email address, will do IMAP pretty well too.Wireless LAN or HotSpot is easy to use, and I got some good free apps for it as well, including putty, so I can ssh into my servers when needed.The Not So Good -There are two ways to get your email, using the built in email client or you can download an application called \"Nokia Messaging\" The build in client is simple and straightforward, as is the Nokia messaging, I have one gripe with the Nokia messaging however, which is that it doesn't stop playing the email alert tone when tap a key. This can be a real pain in meetings, so I basically use the built in email client exclusively now.Lack of MSN /Yahoo / chat support is a pain, but apparently support in a new version of the phone's Operating System.Why oh why didn't they include a USB cable in the box???End result -  Good business phone at a good price.

At first I didn't think I could dial numbers like 1-800-GOFEDEX or any number with letters in them but I finally figured out how.  In case you're wondering here is how:Once you have typed the numbers, press the function key once. Pressing the function key takes you out of the numerical mode and into ABC mode.

The back is easy to open/close, and the build quality is high. Feels solid in the hand. I rather like the lack of external buttons and sliders. Once I got used to how to adjust the volume, left/right on the trackpad, I don't even think about it any more.Starting at the top, the screen is very good to excellent, with the only drawback being lessened readability in bright sunlight. Colors vivid, text crisp (especially important for my old eyes). Keyboard very functional, the smallish rounded-top keys work well with my fat fingers. It's not a Blackberry keyboard though. My main complaint with the keyboard is that the 'function' key in the lower left is an odd shape due to the rounded shape of the lower left side of the phone. I sometimes hit it rather than SHIFT, and vice versa. But a very minor complaint.  Speaker very robust and clear, call quality is great, and speakerphone very loud. Battery life is very good for a 3G phone, and I get 2 - 2 1/2 days of use easily, but in practice leave the phone tethered to a charger at night. I do dislike the fact that even this newish phone uses a proprietary charging and sync cable, and the power cannot be used to sync. I've had quite a few Nokia phones over the years (and even lived in Finland for about five years), so I have a nice museum of discarded chargers and sync cables. Why not use mini-USB or micro-USB?3G service (North American 3G only on this E63-2 model) is excellent here in New Mexico, very seldom do I fall back to EDGE or GSM. Good call quality, very few dropped calls.Software. Since I bought the phone unlocked (SIM-free), not a lot of crapware/bloatware was present. Email was a breeze to set up, but I will say that BB email is far superior.  Syncing to my desktops and laptops is a no-brainer using Bluetooth. I'm primarily a Mac user, so I use iSync with a Nokia add-on to sync calendar and address book. Software updates are not over-the-air (OTA) for this model, so I bought yet another nokia cable to update the firmware/os. And, of course the nokia update is/was windows-only, so I did the update from a netbook running windows7.  Media software is pretty good, but it's not an iPhone.On-going costs: I bought the phone unlocked, and use AT&T; GoPhone PAYG (pay as you go) service, plus a data plan. $100 voice service is valid for a year (and can be topped-off/extended and the amount rolls-over), and the $19.99 for 100MB monthly data plan 'rolls over' if extended within the 30 days. A secret:  Buy 100 MB initially, and then extend it with the $4.99 1MB plan if you're not using it all. This continues the roll-over process. AT&T; only allows 300MB in reserve, so I did a couple months of $19.99 to get the MB up, and now add $4.99 monthly. Point of this: the Nokia email client is very data efficient, I can't use the entire amount of data on the plan, even when I try. Adding light browsing a few times a day (facebook, googling, etc;) is hardly noticeable. I don't do massive music downloads or apps downloads, so, your mileage may vary depending on your usage. I add videos and/or music from my computer directly to the phone via micro-SD card. Anyway ...All in all, for the price (around $225 at the time), this is a great deal! An excellent, solidly-built phone, a superior screen and keyboard, trackpad (rather than trackball), and, great call reception and quality - this is, after all, a mobile phone.

This is the case with the E63 as a successor to the E71 and E61. Cheaper and better. Period.There are a number of arguments for this - no metal case (plastic, here. But hard plastic...); camera isn't something to write home about - but then neither is the previous one.Anyway - who asked for a high-end camera in an efficient business phone? Someone who from Enron that moved to AIG? Gimme a break.Getting back to my starting point - the E61 is a great phone (it still works, after three years, three deep dives & umpteen kocks and drops) which the E71 improved upon - the improvement being that you can no longer buy the E61 but the E71 gave you the same capabilities in a better-looking package.And this is where I get to why I actually like the E63 - it is like the E61 even though it don't got the E71 nifty metal frame, and it's much cheaper, and it still has a great battery life. And because I can't get my hands on another E61 any more. Shame on Nokia.I probaly do not need to make the point but I will - all of the above phones give you document, spreadsheet and .pdf capability. I wrote and sent documents on letterhead from under the beach umbrella on all. I hated my phone bill later (and my lack of patience to use the laptop on a wi-fi hotel link). Then again - all of these Nokias have wi-fi capability - which is a lot more than you can say about a lot more of the competition. And that makes the guilty feeling all the worse.I must pay (lip) service to the competition:1. Aplle i-phone has no battery life which you can't replace and is not a business phone. Please - it's a phun phone.2. Blackberry will give you all of the above, excepting battery life like the e61 or the e63 (Nokia, can I get the e61 battery in an e63 phone? Pretty please?)3.

I really do; my first cell phone in 1998 was a Nokia and it still works to this day. Compare that with the 4 Samsung devices I've had over the years, all of which broken almost exactly a year after the day of activation. I dislike Samsung, I really do.Anyways, once my latest Samsung broke (touch screen petered out, of course), I purchased the E63 and I immediately liked it. I was looking for a phone with a physical keyboard and the E63 was a good price and seemed to have good features. It's not a perfect phone by any means, but over time it gets better and better and I discover more features that make it all the well worthwhile.PROS- Physical keyboard is wonderful and responsive- Has decent office software where you can make work documents and excel spreadsheets- Includes a music player that is decent- Speaker is loud- LOVE the internet radio and the program is very easy to use- Wi-Fi is great and rarely drops a signal- microSD slot allows you to expand your memory- Has the ability to view Flash on web browser- Call quality is good. I've never had difficulty hearing the person on the other end and never head any complaints on my end. Loudspeaker is robust- Tons of shortcut buttons built in. You have the left and right selection button as well as four One touch buttons in-between. And depending on how you organize the home screen, you can use the 4-way selection and middle button as shortcuts as well.- My phone was made in Finland and withstands the worst of slams and drops.- Screen is crisp and clearCONS- Ovi Store STINKS. There is nothing there, half of what is is broken and low-quality. I've only downloaded a bare handful of things and only found one decent theme. It's nothing like what Android and iTunes offers- Little to no personalization options outside of the business perspective (e.g. where you want your calendar to show, reminders on the home screen). As a run-of-the-mill consumer, I would like to have a selection of better themes on Ovi Store or an easy to use application that allows me to build my own theme using my own images, color selections, etc. I've been using the same theme all year and while I still like it, I wish I had more choice- Camera isn't great but that doesn't really bother me.- You cannot view, input or add any language besides those who use the typical alphabet. I read Chinese and everytime I'm on a Chinese website, I get block code. I researched how to download Chinese script but it's region exclusive and the only way you can access it is if you bring your phone to a flagship Nokia store for them to add it or for you to \"flash\" the phone yourself. I resorted to the second option and while it wasn't horribly difficult, I have computer science experience and I can imagine the normal consumer would be hard pressed to even feel comfortable invading their phone, since it can destroy the software. So if you want to read and type in any Russian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, basically any alphabet that isn't based on the typical ABCs, be prepared to do a little work or just look for another more internationally friendly phone.- For being based off a business phone, this isn't very travel friendly. The E63 has a dictionary but if you travel to any country that doesn't use the Roman alphabet, you're SOL. There are no apps to support the traveling business man- Nokia support online is zilch. There's a healthy community of Nokia enthusiasts, but that takes a while to slog through to look for what you want.Nokia is a dying company and it is a shame because they really make great hardware.

I wanted something that would sync with my Microsoft outlook calendar & contacts.  I also wanted to view and send email and be able to surf the web when I am in wi-fi areas.  This phone is accomplishing all those tasks as I had hoped it would.  The syncing works very easily with my contacts and calendar (you have to download the current software for free from the Ovi Store).  I can add people or events on either my computer or my phone and they will coordinate.  I am still working on understanding the fine details and figuring out exactly how to use it most effectively.  The email with my pop3 server was a little more difficult to set up since it kept wanting to connect at first via T-mobile's data plan (which I don't have).  After an hour on the phone each with T-mobile and Nokia, I had gotten nowhere.  Fortunately, my husband figured it out and I have been checking email ever since.  One small thing I have to remember, is that some wi-fi connections require you to go on the web first to \"accept\" their terms before you can send and receive email.  I don't have a work email account to get set up, so I don't know how that works.  The web works fine, though I downloaded Opera as the browser (free) and I like it much better than the software that comes with the phone.  The media player is nice and it syncs with my iTunes account.  It doesn't separate out the music from podcasts, but they are all there.  I have used the camera and agree with all the other posts I have read: it is not a great camera, but it can capture the moment.  I have not tried any video calls with it.  I did buy a microSD card as I believe you would run out of memory very quickly with contacts and music without.  I also bought the USB cable and find it almost necessary.  I don't have any bluetooth stuff, so I haven't used that.  I like the app for YouTube.  I haven't gotten the Novi Maps to work, but i have downloaded Google Map for mobile and have used that some.  It doesn't have a GPS, but it can narrow down where you are based on the cell tower being used.My bottom line, this phone does all of what is advertised and you can use it with wi-fi only (no data plan).

I already have much better reception than I did with my Samsung Gravity 2, and I would not go back for anything.The wifi is an especially great feature, as I am unwilling to pay for mobile internet, but enjoy checking my email when free wifi is present.I must admit I enjoy getting to know new technology, and it took me a while to figure out certain features (e.g. how to turn off the auto key lock feature, as well as the homescreen). However, once I figured it out, I didn't forget, and the rest of the phone became a bit more intuitive.Who should buy this phone? Someone who seeks a decently-priced smartphone that provides a great phone, texting, and (albeit limited) internet experience. If you want an iPhone, buy an iPhone, don't compare it to this phone.

(The speakerphone is not very loud, though)The keyboard is easy to manage and I don't make many mistakes typing. Be warned, though, that with the qwerty layout, you can't dial words correctly...like 1-800-nokia12. The letters are not on the same numbers as they are on a standard phone. Even Nokia didn't know this when I called tech support because my password (a word) wouldn't work. I had to figure it out myself.I still have one issue, though, and that's with mp3 output. It doesn't seem to offer stereo even with a stereo headset. I didn't buy the phone as an mp3 player, but would think that if they offer that feature it would be in stereo.The phone feels good.

The way it works is you open the \"Web\" application and at that point specify your wi-fi connection name and password; you need to also specify that you're always asked before connecting; to disable applications from connecting to your carrier for data you need to specify the option \"When needed\" for \"Packet data connection\" in Settings / Connection / Packet Data... My carrier is sneaky enough to offer certain services which (a) connect to them for data automatically, (b) have a cost themselves besides the data sent and received and (c) are a pain to stop... You can imagine just how much brand loyalty that inspires... With all these settings in place it seems you can always only connect to available wifi hotspots... But I'll be 100% sure when I get my monthly bill...About the phone here's a list of pros:- Very reasonable price- Actual, for real, physical keyboard, which is comfortable to use even for people with large hands; good keyboard shortcuts to get to where you want fast; copy paste to your heart's content- Multitasking: Leave an app running while you do other things- Much better reception than my previous phone (SonyEricsson W880); no more mad dashes to the nearest window, yay!- Can surf the web; gmail app, google maps, Opera, fring (instant messaging from your phone: addictive!), Skype- Obviously bigger and heavier than my very slim W880, but not overly bulky- Easy to learn how to use it if coming from another brand- Battery seems decent, although of course wi-fi and bluetooth use will drain it more quikly- Easy to read screen- Sober looking dark blue; nice feel and ergonomics- Responds quickly, only a couple of instances have thrown it off- Can view and edit word, excel, powerpoint documents- Can connect headphones without an adapter- Found a way to listen to streaming music (see flash problem below), which I find amazingCons and mehs:- Nokia mail seems to want to connect to carrier no matter what I do, so it won't get used- No data cable is included... Doesn't cost much- OS X application seems very limited; need to get the iSync profile or whatever it's called first; Windows program (Ovi something) seems much more complete- Easy to lose plug where headphones connect- Would love to have a way to know for certain that I'm not downloading data from carrier- Some sites ask for flash update- Sound isn't as good as on a SonyEricsson, no where near the great levels of a Sony Walkman: loud hiss on high quality MP3s ripped from CDs...Conclusion: honestly?

So far the smart phone has proved to be absolutely amazing; since I received it I have been totally obsessed in tinkering around with its features.If there's one thing which totally stands out with the Nokia E63 is its price, I had been shopping around for BBs initially and was turned off on their price. I wanted a phone with many business features, quality and don't cost an arm or a leg. The E63 was my answer, at just under $200.00 this phone can stand everything thrown at it.The fact that my team and I arrange adventure travel excursions for international clients means that we are often in many different environmental settings and call quality on the thing seem to be always perfect. I have had a few dropped calls though and am not sure whether that's the phone or the network \"Lime\" I am using.The phone has basically all the features you would need in a smart phone and much more, podcast, radio, maps and a whole host of apps. We conference call on Skype with our partners from Australia every Friday and having the Skype application installed on this handset just makes it a whole lot easier than sitting in front of a computer with a headset.The battery life is more than sufficient, I personally run about 6 applications on my phone at any given time \"Wi-FI Enabled\" - Skype, Opera, YouTube, office, and Nokia mail and the E63 make doing all this a snag.One of the main downside to it is the fact that it doesn't come with much on-board memory and you will have to buy a micro SD card which doesn't cost much, but hey, at least you are not forking over an extra $100 to by a BB.The phone is well built and doesn't look cheap at all, you can view my team and I using it while on the road at my website [...].Thanks to Amazon, the fact that we are in the Caribbean, we received our phone in less than two weeks.

I was very surprised by the small form factor and build quality. Feels very solid in your hand and the rubberized coating on the back prevents slipping. The keyboard was a change for me coming from a Blackberry. The keys feel like they were coated in the same rubber coating on the case and are packed really close together with no gaps in between. They have a very soft feedback that reminds me of using an old school rubber keypad; they don't have the hard click I am used to. That being said, I am sure I would have got used to it. I knew the phone didn't come with a volume rocker switch and I overestimated how much I would miss it. Having to pull the phone away from your ear to adjust the volume is a little annoying.I used this phone with my ATT sim card and it recognized it out of the box with no input from me needed. Reception was terrific and call volume was good. I wanted to use this phone only on Wifi because I didn't want to pay for a data plan. The phone asks you every single time what connection you want to use anytime you run an app that connects to the net. This is really annoying and the fact that you can't establish connection priorities is a huge oversight. I took a suggestion and downloaded an app from the Ovi store specifically to correct this but I couldn't get it to work correctly as it kept wanting to switch to 3G or edge after I was out of Wifi range. Adding to the headache, with 3G disabled the app won't work correctly because it has no other network to switch to.The UI is....... I don't know how to describe it. It feels very 90's to me. Its certainly functional but a little attention to ease of use and polish couldn't hurt. The options to change settings on the phone for the most part are easy to access but there are a lot of inconsistencies that kinda ruin the experience. Lots of messages to confirm over and over, digging through tons of sub menus. I was expecting something a bit more seamless.Google offers a sync app that only works for Gmail for the symbian OS. So I setup the Nokia exchange app to sync my google calender and contacts. I followed the instructions on google's website to the letter but it kept coming up with error messages that the sync was failing. Even with the errors, I was getting my email but not my calender or contacts. Frustrating.So the phone is going back and it looks like I will have to spend more money to get the UI and setup experience I am looking for. If you have a data plan and are tech savy enough to find apps and tweaks, I am sure you can get the E63 to work like a dream and come out on top considering the price of the phone.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good reception", "Author": "Ching-Hsiang Lin \"dino750\"", "ReviewID": "R2TY6RPXIKA0NS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a smart phone, but I don't really use those SMART features.

But at the moment the ATT service for the iPhone is simply out of my budget and I still have a few months left on my T-Mobile account. I went searching for a quality phone that had a full keyboard since I text a lot, and the quality and versatility, the ability to sync with my Mac OS. After searching at the other options (blackberry, palm, samsung, lg) there was simply no comparison for the price, and in fact I after receiving the phone and using if for almost a month, I am really pleased with it. But since I am not going to write a novel here on the virtues and vices of this phone (or any other 'thing-product' whatsoever - ain't that just losing sight of priorities a bit?), I am making this effort just for those in similar conundrums (their phone broke, lost, etc. and need to buy a new one, but don't want to spend $400 or up)Pros: Ergonomically, the phone seems a perfect balance of size and weight. In fact in has a nice weight to it that lends it a solidity, without being too heavy. It's not clunky like the blackberries and is more elegant. (the keyboard is slightly small, but makes sense to keep the width nice, and it's manageable (probably more so for female hands). The battery is quite large and gives it a long operational time. I seem to go at least 4 days without charging (if I don't connect with wi-fi, that certainly uses more power). As for going online, the wi-fi and browser work really well - certainly it's not for the most functional online experience, but great for checking some news, sites, and works especially smoothly if it's a mobile web configured site. The most useful aspect of the wi-fi is VoIP, that is, making calls via the internet - I cannot boast of this more highly. I used it almost right away and it works superbly - this is a big, big advantage if one doesn't want to use their account minutes (it comes configured with Gizmo - where you can purchase credit - but if you download Nimbuzz, you can add you're Skype account (and about a gazzillion more (chat accounts, yahoo, msn - it coordinates all these communication accounts under one account, and works well so far!). The Calander, Contact syncing works great with my Mac - and it's all bluetooth wireless.Con: Nokia doesn't have the app variety of the iPhone (but that is not really so much as a complaint as I didn't expect it would!) The interface is ok, but some steps seem to be redundant and could be tweaked better (like when wanting to make a call, one has to keep navigating through a few steps. Nokia still has not added this phone to it's Ovi suite (which coordinates your cell phone with your computer and online account to make it more seamless, but they say they will) ; also waiting for their Ovi suite to work with the Mac OS (once again, they say it will happen soon).

Then i checked my usage and found that i m not at all using 3G as most of the place i have wifi available. GPS i already have in CAR. So why to shell 140+ buck over just 2 fetaurs...which i m not goig to use. So this is totally my own requirement based decision. Now more regarding pros and cons:- Phone is blesing fast(same as E71) No compromise in speed even cheapear then E71.- As whole world know 3.2MP in E71 or 2MP E63 both are crappy. As most of the time business ppls don't mind this.- Productivity softwares are limited, but who cares, on Symbian everything available.- wifi and bluetooth works greate, without any glitch.- Sound quality is more then good enough. But don't compare it with any music/walkman series phone... as this phone's usage is different.- Display is crystal clear. In full sunlight also i can read even smallest character without efforts.- Keypad: initially i thought it's very small keys...but in just 5 minutes i can type very fast without much mistakes. It's really good one.- U can use your own choice of headphone. One came with bundle is just formality in package.- Nokia missed a USB cable. I am sure it will not cost them 3 to 5 bucks to give with bundle. Anyways i ordered from Amazon in just 2.5 $ + around 3 $ shipping :) instead of 29.5 $ on Nokia site.- Next most important thing is fancy Colors. All E series should be available in minimum Black or Dark grey colors. I opted for Blue one :(.- Browser requires some more improvements. Web pages without mobile specific version some time not displayed properly. Speed is good enough.- Build quality is rock solid. No voice of lose plastics. Even you don;t feel it's made up from plastic.Again selection of buying this one is just my intended usage based. Also i specifically does not want a touch screen due to i never take care of this gadgets. One more biased thing is that i have never used phone other then Nokia. I can't leave without nokia in my pocket.Hope this will help you and thanks Amazon for creating such trusted  & reliable market place, which provides merchandises at rock bottom prices.", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Ok phone", "Author": "Dishum", "ReviewID": "RVLOWZ2GZ0814", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's a good phone for the price and all the features you can have with this phone.

I had to buy an unlocked phone because my contract wasn't up and I had somehow broken two clamshell phones in the space of about six weeks. Given this history, I am particularly pleased with the sturdiness of the e63. I've dropped it a number of times (including when it wasn't in its Otterbox sleeve) with no apparent ill effects.Other things I like: Nice bright screen. The handy flashlight feature (press the spacebar). Easy to use keyboard, good for texting. I use it more and more as a text-messaging tool and a substitute brain, for example, the calculator, the converter tool, the notes, the alarm clock, the calendar. Call quality is generally good (I have A&T; and suffer dropped calls less often than I did before, though I don't know if this can be attributed to the phone or improvements to the network.) A nice looking phone that feels solid and pleasant in the hand, but not too heavy in the pocket. Battery life is very long, esp if you have WLAN screening and Bluetooth off, and it recharges  quickly. It also tells you when the battery is fully charged, which is nice. When I travelled to Poland this spring, the phone proved very handy: We removed the SIM card, put in a local one, and it was ready to go with a local number, giving us in-country  calls and texting for a very reasonable price.Some things not so great: The camera is nothing special, as others have observed. I personally have found the Ovi  app store to be a confusing horror. I find it hard to surf the web with this phone -- the screen seems  too small, downloading is very slow, and it's hard to navigate. Even e-mail is highly irritating, resorted to only in desperation. (I don't have a data plan; I use WiFi when I can find it, so this may be coloring my impression of the slowness. But I had a data plan for a while, and checking email was also so slow and laborious that I wanted to hang myself then, too.)But, overall, I am pleased with this phone.

A couple time the Contact sync failed, but the items added to my Outlook contact were added to my phone anyway.  THE OUTLOOK CALENDAR SYNC is the worst I have LOST information when syncing even when I have not made any changes either to Outlook on my desktop or my phone, I synced the calendar and lost information - that was really bad.  Also, every time I sync the notes in my calendar experience a format change which is annoying, so I can't keep an outline format, it changes font and color for different lines of text, it erases information - really sucks.  So I am not syncing my Calendar anymore, VERY VERY UNHAPPY about that.

Another thing about this phone is its international support. It doesn't provide cross language support well. But it's easy to setup foreign language fonts and input methods. I setup full Chinese Support, it works well. I recommend E63 for those who have a main street job, enjoy their life but not get addict to entertainment stuffs.In conclusion:Pro:Good price for a well designed smart phone,I got it on Amazon around $150S60v3 system responses to your command faster than Windows Mobile handset.Rare system crash, longer standing 3G web browser battery standing hours.Con:Keyboard needs improvement,Volume when you pick up a call is a little smaller than ideal level, but that's acceptable.Poor international support, by default the phone only support the major languages within phone's sale area. (So North America edition not support Asian language by default)--->Though you can use 3rd party fonts plug in software to force it support Chinese, Japanese, Germany,...etcLimited applications available in online store and 3rd party developers.Poor email box system comparing to Blackberry's.<---But many people don't actually need very powerful email systemThough Con points are more than Pro's, you should understand all these con's are not important to you if you use it as a mobile phone rather than your pocketable PC.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "BEST PHONE EVER", "Author": "J.

This phone is so well designed, built in Finland, and intuitively programmed that it's like a breath of fresh Scandanavian air dispelling the foul stench of rotten Blackberries.After many technical problems with my Blackberry, and its generally STUPID programming, this Nokia is a superstar.  It's reliable, full-featured, and intelligently designed.  It has great battery life, easy-to-navigate menus, every feature I want, great graphics, a big screen, a full keyboard, etc.  I have no regrets.  I've always had GOOD luck with Nokias, and now I'm a loyal Nokia user.  I'll never buy any other brand now, and I'm NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER going to get another Blackberry piece of crap again.  In fact, I'd rather have an angry rhino stomp on my crotch than have to own a Blackberry again.  Screw them.  For the money, they should make a better product.  I mean, a TRACKBALL on a cellphone?  What the hell was I thinking buying that piece of junk?  The trackball tended to stick, making it super annoying to navigate the screens.

Think about it when Apple was coming out with the iPhone (my wife owns it so I know how good it really is) Nokia's CEO (I thought he would know everything - he is the highest paid employee of the company) said apple has no clue what they are getting into. Oh guess what its been 2 years and nokia has no clue how to create a competitive product that can be a iphone clone - forget about surpassing it.This phone cannot play any games and it cannot play any music. I downloaded 4x4 monster tuck game from nokia web site and it would not even install. I sent an email to tech support and then the mess begins. It seems Nokia does not have a US support center. No no its not in India or some cheap country its in Europe. So they call in the afternoon and they can support you for like 2 or 3 hours that it - time to go to the pub. So first they sent me an email that seemed to indicate that they have sent me a link of some sorts on the phone - which never came to me. I waited some more. Then I got a survey email - looks like issue resolved. I responded with a very positive survey and sent them email as well. They came back oh sorry here is the link oh and that link will expire after 2 hours (aka we will be in the pub by then). And that link downloaded the file but install failed - this time certificate error. OK back to them - did not install blah blah blah. Oh just make sure you have correct time and date on the phone. He dumbos who does not have correct time and date on a (apprently) smart phone. Anyway oh OK then reset the phone. OK I did. oh the link has expired - here is another one - oh I need to go to the pub now. After all then still certificate error. Next day it start again - reset the phone... I gave up on that bunch of panzies. The game was only 2.99 but the you get the point.OK I cannot play games on the phone. I can live with that - may be. Can I play my music on it? My old nokia phone that costed me exactly $0.00 (with the contract ofcourse) did the job pretty well. Nope you cannot do that either.
