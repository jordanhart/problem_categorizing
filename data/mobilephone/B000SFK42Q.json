I broke the screen and insurance replaced it with one of their newer versions.  The light on the phone \"for the camera\" doubles as an amazing flashlight, which I believe they have a feature to just turn on the light without the camera mode.  Most phones do not have lights so taking pictures at night never works out and trying to find things in the dark with that dim cell phone screen light \"even if it's an app that turns your screen white,\" is never as good as a real light.  Sony is a reliable company that I have loved ever since PS1.I never had a problem with this phone till it broke, which was purely my fault climbing over a wrought iron fence whilst inebriated and trying to sneak into a community jacuzzi.I recommend this phone to anyone any day.  loved it and I miss it.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great service, quick response, reccommeded thumbs up***", "Author": "Sherene", "ReviewID": "RYIAORI9TU4PX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great, fully reccommeded got response quickly and staff is really helpful, shipped quickly as wellgreat phone, love it features are kool", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't buy it", "Author": "Shane C. Moberg", "ReviewID": "R3M0XSO3XZT2WE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the phone because of the 2 megapixel camera and the walkman option on it.  The functionality of the walkman is limited and clicking through the songs to get to what you want to listen to can be a pain.The camera can take good pictures but it doesn't have a flash.  Instead, it has an option to turn on a light.  So you have this annoying bright light blinding people while you try to take the picture.The keys are so close together that it's hard to dial.  I've used plenty of modern cell phones with out a problem.  This one makes me feel like I have chronic 'fat finger syndrome'.Worst about this phone is the size.  They've made it as small as possible, but for an open faced phone, it's to small to hold up against the side of my head.  I have trouble keeping the tiny speaker centered on my ear.  As a result, if I want to speak to someone for any length of time, I use a blue tooth.I always had a flip phone before this one, and it's annoying to have the open face.  If you don't lock your phone, you're apt to bump it and accidently redial someone, go onto the internet, or start playing the last track of music your were listening to.This is a quality phone and haven't had any technical problems with it, but I expect that most people would prefer to look elsewhere.  You can find these options on plenty of other cellphones.", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000SFK42Q"}}
