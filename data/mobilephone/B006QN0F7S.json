Now it has been passed onto my mom. Phone works great. Has never had any problems at all. So I purchased this one for my daughter as a Valetines day gift. She loves it. It is really kid friendly and easy for a middle school to learn. The product was as advertised and came when it was supposed to. I highly recommend this product.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "ONLY good for temporary", "Author": "Y. Pan", "ReviewID": "R11DZDIYNTZO6L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have this phone for a little bit over a year now.And I still believe I could stand this phone.PRO:-Love the keyboard! Enjoyed a great time texting!-Pretty neat looking phone, not cheap looking-Easy to work with-A really good choice, IF you are ONLY using it for TEMPORARY-Sound is pretty good for a pre-paid phoneCON:-Wouldn't last PERFECTLY for a year (I GUARANTEE)At first I loved this phone because it was everything I expected, except the vibrate sound scares me, because it sound like this phone could break anytime!Until about half a year, it started to have some minor glitches. Til about a year, this phone started to turn off or freeze randomly, and when you slide the keyboard, the screen wouldn't turn. That's when I started to regret not listening to these reviews... It's BAD for a reason-Can't use ring tones unless they are less than 17 seconds-Only holds up to 500 Messages, can't use memory card to solve the problemI am a big texter, so it's a pretty big disadvantage-Slowwwwwwww-Locked to ATTYou get signals in other countries, but you can't use SIM cards other that ATTAfter using it for more than a year... In conclusion... In most cases... DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Be careful", "Author": "S.
