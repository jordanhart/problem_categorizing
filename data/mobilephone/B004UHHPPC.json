I stopped carrying my digicam and handicam now.* metal rim and brushed metal finish, anti slip back cover and gorilla glass makes it beautiful and robust.I love this phone.....and cyanogen, you rock!!!![UPDATE 2011,DEC15]I have this phone for seven months now. With cm7.1, battery life is not a problem, I'm getting around 34 hours with 3g always on, exchange sync every 15 min, gtalk, gmail(push), facebook-chat always on.

The touchscreen is really sensitive which is good because I've had other LG touchscreen phones that didn't work so well. As for the display, it is great, beautiful colors and resolution. The phone is big but it fits in your pocket and your hand with no problem. The camera records HD videos in 1080p and 720p, but 720p is slightly better. The materials of the phone are nice, they make the phone look really elegant. The only problem is battery consumption, it barely makes it through the day, but it's totally worth it. Overall it's a really great phone, it comes with all the accessories but car charger. I'm happy with the purchase and it probably kicks the iPhone's ass in processing power.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "fast and good graphics, but major problems with battery, operating system, and music application", "Author": "N Lenihan", "ReviewID": "R17X4Y6H03HCIY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the LG Optimus 2X after I lost my iphone, and I regret the purchase. It is a fast phone, and the graphics are very sharp, but there are major problems with the phone:* Battery Life -- I have tried every trick to adjust this, and still the phone often does not make it through the day. The only way I can guarantee the phone to make through the day is to check 'Use only 2G networks'. I purchased a second battery for the phone.* Crashes frequently -- When using the internet, if I access a webpage not specifically designed for mobile phones, the browser will often crash, and sometimes the cell phone becomes unresponsive and turns off. Also, I have had the phone for about three months, and it seems about twice a week the phone randomly reboots. (n.b. I have the most recent operating system, and to my knowledge, there are not viruses on the phone).* Camera -- the camera takes decent photos, but the flash is nearly useless. Thus it is difficult to take decent photos in poor light. Also, the camera functionality is poorly designed. For example, the zoom is difficult to adjust and often non-responsive.* Glitches in operating system -- There are a few annoying glitches in the operating system, but my main issue is with the music service. When I am playing music, and I pull out the headjack, the cell phone continues to play the music through the cell phone speaker for about two seconds. There are other problems with the music service which I describe below.* Problems with music service -- I have a lot of music on my mobile (about 12gb), and the cell phone is unable to handle that much music. When the phone reboots (anytime it crashes or I change the battery, thus it reboots often), it takes 3-10 minutes for the media to 'reload'. In comparison, the Apple iPhone loads music almost instantaneously. Also, there is a bug in the music Playlist where the playlists are duplicated. Sometimes the playlists are duplicated where I have twice as many playlists. I have about 50 playlists, and after a few weeks, I can easily have 800 playlists (750 duplicates). I found a program to remove the duplicate playlists, but the problem persists (n.b. I downloaded other music programs and none of them work well, or are able to handle large amount of music).* Price Depreciation -- I looked into selling the phone at a computer center in Hong Kong, and the dealers would take no more than $HK2000 (about $US250) for the phone (I purchased the phone three months ago for $HK4800 or US$610). In comparison, an iPhone 4 as new costs $HK5100 -- the dealers would purchase a used iPhone 4 for about $HK4200.Many of the problems outlined above might be attributable to Android. I don't know anyone else with an Android who has a much music as me. However, other people have suggested my problems are unique to LG.In conclusion, it's a fast phone with good graphics, but that does not matter much, as there are so many other problems with the phone. I would not recommend this phone.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Read this before buying!", "Author": "Big A \"Wesley\"", "ReviewID": "R3R3MPORMJ2Z41", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Please read this review before you purchase this phone. I bought this phone for my wife when it was brand new from T-Mobile. It has been nothing but a headache since about 3 weeks after we got the phone. I bought my wife another phone and took the G2X once the issues began.I won't overwhelm this review with technical issues, but I will highlight the main ones. Also you most know that I had full coverage on the phone and both T-Mobile and LG are slugs when it comes to customer service.1. LG had issues with the battery running hot which caused phone issues. I had to send the phoneback to LG twice and it still over heats occasionally.2. Phone powers off at random times and freezes every few days. This requires a full battery pull torestart the device.3. The phone also has horrible reception. I live one town over from T-Mobile's US headquarters andyou would think I'd have the best service, but no =(.4. Sent the phone back to T-Mobile and they finally admitted the phone was a flop.In return I got a new LG G2x with the same issues but a few more days between freezes.5. Upgrades to the operating system come slow if at all. LG knows they screwed up the programingon what should be an awesome Google phone. So in return they concentrate on their other newerdevices.I have had nothing but problems with this phone and will never by a LG product again! I'm not normally like that this but LG's customer service is horrible. As for my relationship with T-Mobile, I'll be leaving them in September when my contract is up. It is sad because I have been a happy subscriber since 2000 and they did nothing for me after repeated complaints about this phone. Everyone constantly shifted the blame amoungst each other.Please do your research and pick another phone.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG Optimus 2X - Not for all.", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "RPPZJCR9YV3RG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great device for those who know what they are looking for.

NOT!The P990 (Optimus 2X) works on 900, 1900 and 2100Mhz 3G networks.  The P990 is intended for Europe/International. The P999 (Optimus G2X) only works on 1700 and 2100Mhz 3G networks (as per specifications given in this description). The P999 is a different phone altogether with different HSDPA for 3G networks. The P999 is intended for North America, not International.So the description of the item \"P990 and International\" doesn't match the specifications of \"HSDPA 1700 and 2100Mhz.\"Note also there is a model P990h (Optimus 2X), which is a Spanish (South America) version of the P990. If you want a P990 for South America, then the P990h is your phone. If you want one for Europe, China, Korea, International, etc, then I'd suggest that you avoid the P990h.To add to the confusion, there are some P999s marketed as Optimus 2X in Canada. So, don't think 2X or G2X, think P990, P990h, and P999.Buyer be aware! If you want 3G, the descriptions here are botched and you are libel to get anything. It is a bit like Phone shopping a' la Russian Roulette. You may find yourself with poor or no data service for this phone where you plan to use it. And, that's half of what most folks buy a Smart phone for, the data!Go here to see the difference between the P990 and the P999:[...][...]Almost identical except for the data service!These vendors have driven me crazy trying to get a P990 Optimus 2X - I've gotten anything but. So far I've received a P990h and a P999! I've been in return heck for two weeks with these folks and I still don't have the phone I want. I don't expect I ever will.That said, a P990 is a great phone. I bought one for my son two months ago from one of the vendors here. Normally I'd give it five stars, but the false advertising bring the whole deal down to a single star. I guess I got lucky the first time. Now I was trying to purchase one for myself, and I've learned my lesson the hard way. Ask the vendor before you purchase one!

You should not by this phone if you don't know about rooting android & flashing custom roms.So... that being said, the hardware is great. Just get it, root it, install CM10.1 for it and you now have the best phone ever. Make sure to do the \"IntSD-MountFix.zip\" stuff or use AIO Toolkit: Press 4 for repartition, 2 for Old partition, 1 for stock, choose TRWP, after the TRWP step AIO Toolkit will ask you if you wanna fix the Mount issue. Say yes.  Once you have TRWP on your phone, flashing the CM10.1 zip file is easy and the phone will work amazingly well. I'm a bit suspicious that bluetooth isn't working in 10.1 though; might work in 10.2... anywayz...but for $180, this phone running CM10+ is a deal.UPDATE: If you end up with the disappearing keyboard problem when trying to type on facebook.app or send SMS, you'll have to reflash the phone freshly with CM10+... then flash gapps-jb-20130427-nonneon-tonyp.zip . Explanation here: [...] Or, if all else fails, flash cm-7.2.0-p990.zip . It's an older android 2.3.7, but it works smoothly. Then every once in awhile try the nighties at [...] . Just make sure before you do this stuff; you make backups of any important files; for most people that's the \"Camera\" folder with all vids/pics on the camera. Then remove the microSD so no accidental formats of it happen.UPDATE2: Um... so cm-7.2.0-p990.zip's home-button doesn't work and all the CM10+ images don't allow USB mounting unless you reboot to TWRP and mount from there. Oh, but cm-10.1-20131028-NIGHTLY-p990.zip enables 3G on the phone. If when using data, you see a \"E\" next to your singal-bar that's like \"1g\" or \"WAP\" or something. Very slow. With the CM image I just mentioned, you'll see an \"H\" or \"3G\" so the data-speed is much faster than some other CM images. The only issue I have now is with the USB mounting.

Fully charged, used constantly for 2 hours on wi-fi (unsecured obviously), alternating between 2G & 3G network as I was doing various tests, GPS not active, screen brightness under 50% brightness (default setting), closed unnecessary apps (calender, weather and other default open apps), battery was down to 68% after 2 hours.-The deal breaker for me however is this phone does NOT support tkip+aes encryption and does not specify that information anywhere so you can know that before you buy. This is probably going to be a problem if you require a password to access your wireless network (802.11b/g/n).Again this phone boasts support for \"WLAN Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n\" (as quoted from the Technical Details of the product on Amazon). It is assumed, and rightfully SHOULD be assumed, that any product on the market today that claims it supports 802.11b/g/n ALSO supports the encryption/security standards that are accompanied with those protocols. This phone does not. As verified by LG via LG's customer service chat, this phone does not support tkip+aes encryption. The phone DOES support 802.11x unsecured but as soon as you require a password using tkip+aes encryption to access your wireless network, no joy.After my chat with LG I got back on chat 20 minutes later (got the same guy) to ask them \"if the phone doesn't support tkip+aes, then what encryption methods DOES is support?\" They \"couldn't get me that information\" as my phone model {LGP990) was the international model and they don't have access to that information. When I asked them how they knew 20 minutes ago that my phone doesn't support tkip+aes they told me they thought I was talking about the LGP999 (US model). I have an emailed copy of the first chat transcript that proves I specifically said LGP990, NOT LGP999. They also said they couldn't get me techinical details because \"there could be differences\" between the models. In any case it's obvious that neither the LGP990 nor the LGP999 support tkip+aes. If you want to use secure wi-fi, beware this may not be the phone for you.Note this problem could be easily fixed via a firmware update. I officially asked them to put in a request for LG to work on building an update that fixes this problem. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it though. I'm returning the phone for a refund. Phone is in the mail as I type.I would also like to point out that my wife(android phone) & daughter's phones (each 1/2 the cost of the Optimus 2x and OLDER) work fine on my secured wireless network using tkip+aes. As does my wife's tablet(Android). And also my PSP, PS3, 4 laptops, and desktop all work perfectly on my network using tkip+aes.Yesterday I ordered the Motorola Atrix 4G Motorola Atrix Unlocked 4G Cell Phone with Android 2.2 OS. 4-inch HD touchscreen to replace the LG. I verified with Motorola via chat that the Atrix DOES support tkip+aes encryption (it does). I also sent them my router specs (as seen below) and they said I shouldn't have any problems.The Atrix 4g has almost exactly the same specs as the Optimus 2x including the same processor and 4\" screen but is physically smaller (117.8 x 63.5 x 11mm vs LG's 123.9 x 63.2 x 10.9mm), has double the internal storage (16GB vs LG's 8GB), has double the RAM (1GB vs LG's 512MB), and has better screen resolution (540 x 960 pixels vs LG's 480 x 800 pixels). It does lose when it comes to the main camera though (5MP vs LG's 8MP). There are a few other ways each one is better/worse than the other but I hit the main points.

It lasted a month before my friend spilled coffee near it and it took a splash to the rear and pretty much died. The camera port, definitley not moisture tight.  I like the fact that it is closer to pure Android, at the same time it's missing some features from my old HTC desire, like voice to text coming already enabled on the HTC and clock/weather already setup with a default on the main screen. HTC hid a lot of settings which I despise and HTC locked a bunch of apps into their phones which begs for rooting (I prefer not to have to root just to deleet a useless app, like Amazon MP3 for instance, oops this is amazon isn't it.)  I mainly chose this phone for the HDMI output which, unfortunately, I never got to use.The battery begs for the extended life upgrade as I was never able to make it through a day. At least the battery upgrade is cheap here on Amazon. I already knew that the half GB memory in the HTC was inadequate, but I quickly found that the 1GB of this phone is also inadequate. Android and all the apps were severely underestimated in their usage of memory. I have to recommend a 2GB phone as a minimum for Android, especially with the new versions forcing more and more into the onboard memory and off of your SD card, which really makes no sense to me.  One of the reasons no one considers Nokia's windows phones is partly because of their refusal to include SD memory support. But with Android its becoming relegated to music and picture storage only, why be like MSFT?  Anyway back to the phone...the display is amazing! The touch is nicely responsive. They had a lot of good ideas with this phone, I just question the construction values. I am not a fan of HTC, but my HTC was splashed plenty of times and never had a problem.

Its snappier than anything else you would find in this price range, the screen is beautiful and colors look rich and vibrant unlike HTC I have owned (incredible S/ Desire HD). Love the micro HDMI connector and the supplied cord it's a much less bulky solution than the MHL solution in My Galaxy S2. Battery life is a little less then my S2 but I usually get a day and 5-8 hrs between charges with wifi/ data on constantly and moderate use. The Geforce ULP is very good at gaming and doesn't make the phone hot like my S2. The camera is comparable to my old INC S and the video at 720p is better, at 1080p is worse than my S2 by far. I would suggest just recording in 720p the framerate is much better. Sometimes I do feel limited by the ram but I have TB installed and froze all the bloatware from running so it helps alot. My only con is the speaker volume when the phone is ringing even at the loudest setting it's just to tiny. This phone compared to the atrix is far smoother and snappier at basically every task I've tried even with lower ram, this is by far the best performance to price ratio for and android phone right now.

Now back on topic, this phone is really GREAT for the cost. The dual cores with the Tegra chipset really comes in handy. Plays games without any lag like Nova 3 from Gameloft and Real Racing 2 from EA. Games yet have to be programmed to use the full potential of two cores. Would have been awesome if the phone came with a gig of ram, that would have been perfect. The phone was preloaded with android 2.3.4 which SUCKS! LG is due to release 4.0 ICS sometime within the next couple months which should be a HUGE difference. I would get CM9 but it does not support GPU acceleration so thats a big no no for me.The screen honestly makes everything look great. The 8mp camera in the back really looks great in a well lighted area. Only downfall is the flash. Most of the times with the flash the images come out very blurry. The front camera sucks rendering it useless pretty much, I guess its ok with skype but to take pictures its poor. The LG theme is pretty good on the phone but i completely switched to the ICS theme which was a huge difference. I strongly suggest downloading the ICS theme from the market as well as the ICS Keyboard. Makes things a lot easier.All in all, this is a wonderful phone for the price. I do not regret my purchase at all. I wish amazon had the white version. I have the phone hooked up here in the US with Straight Talk.

After a while reading and investigating i found that problem is caused according many people with the same problem for the applications preinstalled by LG. One solution for that is uninstalling that applications but is needed change the OS version, or uninstall the applications itself. In both cases is needed root the phone.Anyway, that is my only complain. The seller looks good and the delivery speed was faster than i expected. So far that phone will be very good with another OS version.  But who knows.

I chose this because it was among the best phones you could get for less than 400$ (at the moment I bought it) and because the phone is not so big. I don't like phones with screens over 4\" because they are more difficult to handle in your hands and don't easily fit in pockets.After a year and a half with it, it's running smoothly with an up to date custom rom and it looks as good as new.PROS:-Powerful phone, and you can overclock it and make it even more powerful. It runs current mobile games just fine.-Beautiful to look at screen. It doesn't need to be amoled or retina to look beautiful. Also, it's supposed to be scratch resistant but I'm not willing to try it.-Easy to root and to install new roms on it. I have a custom Jelly bean 4.3 rom that runs smoothly on the phone. There's an Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) official update too.-Replaceable battery, expandable storage via sd card.-Quadband, it works with any phone operator in any country (as long as they work with GSM sim cards)-Decent rear camera, I've taken good pics with it.-Not too big, and it's thin so it fits in pockets without a problem.CONS:- The only way to turn on the screen to unlock it is the power button, so treat it nicely. There's an option in some roms to make the volume buttons work to wake the phone, but they don't always work. You can also use apps such as \"Tap Tap App\", which wakes the phone by tapping at the sensor, but again, it doesn't always work.-512 MB is too low memory, and having lots of apps can slow the phone down.-The front camera takes pictures too dark if you're not in broad daylight.-The flash is too bright and can screw pictures if you take them too close.I know there are lots of phones better than this today, but if you can get one cheap with little use or refurbished, I'd recommend it, it's a warrior of a phone.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG Optimus 2X, excellent phone!!!", "Author": "Domingo Osorio", "ReviewID": "R2J7KWTEHY4F33", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone went smoothly, brand new, surprised that brought the HDMI cable, but not micro sd card, but that's not important! a telephone sober, elegant, just great!
