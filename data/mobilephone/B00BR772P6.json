{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Gave the Torque a try... Returned after 8 days.", "Author": "Topher", "ReviewID": "R2DYOUDLMW1UZ5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me first start with saying that I am accustomed to the old Motorola Nextel 'bricks' which could withstand being dropped/thrown/run over by a car without any sort of hiccup... and the iDEN network which was so reliable that you could get a Direct Connect call through whenever you wanted, even during natural disasters/terrorism/power outages/etc.I run a small business which required quick PTT style communications about 10 days a month... It was well too expensive to open an account with Nextel for a PTT only plan, so we used Boost Prepaid ($1/day unlimited PTT) which worked great for us.... boy oh boy do I miss that, but i digress.Our needs have recently expanded to requiring PTT communications as well as phones for employees so I gave Sprint and the Torque a try, with the assumption that I could return the devices within 14 days. I purchased 3 of them on April 2nd and ended up returning them on April 10th. It's going to cost me $234.13 after all the prorated charges, activation, and restocking fees....... Lovely. Anyway, onto the review:The Good:This phone is a tank. In the short term, it seems like it really can take a beating.... from drops to taking a swim. I am extremely concerned about long term reliability though (see 'ugly' section).4GLTE Support: While LTE isn't currently available in CT, it was nice to see this feature in a Direct Connect device. (Side note: Whenever I enabled LTE to check if an LTE signal was present, it disabled direct connect. I sure hope this is resolved in the future)For a smartphone, the battery life was decent. We used Group Connect for a constant 3 hours and had only used about a quarter of the battery.The speaker for Direct Connect and calls was extremely loud and clear.The Bad:This phone features a Sonic Receiver (fancy way of saying there's no 'hole' to let receiving sound through) which is most likely there to increase waterproofing of the device. The sound through this receiver was fairly muffled and quiet. At maximum volume I would have trouble hearing the other side of calls. I typically used the speakerphone.The combination of a second layer of waterproofing over the screen as well as a relatively dim back light is a recipe for disaster when trying to use this phone in direct sunlight. The second layer was extremely reflective. I found myself manually turning the back light to maximum and having to shield the sunlight with my hand in order to see the screen.All of the physical buttons are SO EASY to press... Upon receiving a Direct Connect call with the phone on your belt, simply removing the phone from the clip causes you to press the PTT button at least 3 times, or press the 'PTT speaker off' button, which when in direct sunlight was difficult to realize and correct the mistake. It caused a lot of \"What was that?\" \"Huh?\" type of calls. One time I even just pulled out my iPhone and made the call, rather than using DC.The Ugly -- Major issues which made me return the devices:Sprint Direct Connect is not ready for prime time use. We constantly received \"Error 900\" messages, even when standing in the same room. Sprint assured me that all issues would be resolved with 'an upcoming tower update'. I am not going to sit here and wait for Sprint to fix these issues, especially while locked into a contact.The phones software is buggy. It would freeze up at the worst times, such as receiving a telephone call (and unable to swipe the green button to answer) or when trying to respond to a DC call. A battery pull/reboot typically fixed these issues.With one of my three devices, we had an intermittent issue with the DC Speaker/Microphone. If the DC Speaker was on and an incoming DC came through, the audio was so quiet that you'd think the speaker was off... but the volume was at maximum. If you tried turning the DC Speaker off/on, it would just completely turn off all sound. Whats worse is that even if you were able to hear the caller speaking and you tried to respond, the other side of the call sounded like you were whispering... even if you're yelling into it. We tried a factory reset, updating software, battery pulls, etc...I am extremely concerned with the build quality of this phone. Yes, it is a tank, but upon returning the phones, the Sprint Representative noticed that one of the main screws on the front was missing. Clearly I wasn't taking anything apart, it just fell out by itself. I wonder what that screw missing did for the waterproofing of the device... Oh well.Bottom Line:Sprint, please resolve your issues with Direct Connect. I know you can't bring back trusty old iDEN, but at least fix the network you have now. Better yet, ditch kyocera and bring back the Motorola phones which were of great build quality.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kyocera Torque with 2 way direct connect on Sprint A++", "Author": "BackhoeOperator", "ReviewID": "R3UDRB70ZFBYOC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are an excavating & demolition company, and own several of these phones.  We have had them since the day they were released.  The supervisors have the Torque and the workers have the Kyocera DuraXT. Our company uses these phones every day, seven days a week, in a commercial environment, wet and muddy conditions.  They are truly AWESOME.  We actually switched from the iphones because of the direct connect feature.  I know there are apps out there that give the iphone the 2 way capability, but NONE were near as good as the Sprint 2 way. Yes, in the beginning there were some bugs, but now they have worked them out and the system is VERY RELIABLE.  I would say it gives our company an edge because every worker have a 2 way radio on his/her belt. Even the office people have these phones. I cannot say enough good about these phones, both the Torque (the smart phone) and the DuraXT (kind of a basic phone).  Mine (the Torque) has been dropped in mud, water, and I even ran it over with the bachoe once, and it still works flawlessly!  All our phones are in Balistic cases as well, maybe this made a difference when I ran it over, but it still works perfect.Highly recommend for ANYONE who wants a commercial grade, durable phone with the Nextel type 2 way. Any business would benefit from these phones.

Smartphone suppliers seem to have so many offerings that it will you're your head spin. So when one discovers an Android phone that has been ruggedized, it is enough to perk ones interest.This Kyocera Torque is definitely a ruggedized phone, and checking the manufacturer's specifications, it meets or exceeds the MilSpec 810G and IP 67 certification. What that means in simple terms is that it is designed to meet standards for rain, immersion, vibration, shock and dust resistant, salt fog, humidity, solar radiation, altitude, low and high temperature storage, and possibly more. But one look at this phone with its rubberized Dura-Grip housing and you'll know that it was designed to stand up against drops, spills, wet weather and other such unexpected calamities that we often face. It is by no means a perfect smartphone designed to fit the needs of everyone, as like everything it has its high and low points.\u25c6 Likes:+ Extremely rugged; the case is designed to withstand the elements+ Long battery life; uses a 2500mAh rechargeable Li-ion battery+ Very bright screen; reasonably sharp and legible+ Very good call quality; clear and loud+ Very little bloatware\u25c6 Mixed:\u00b1 Too many buttons; had to re-program the Direct Call button\u25c6 Dislikes:- Mediocre overall performance\u25c6 In Use:Activation is easy. Once it is alive, it can be done through the Kyocera Torque itself, online from your computer, or by calling Sprint at the phone number in the instructions. I tried the phone method as I had questions, and got through very quickly, though I had to navigate my way through their (insidious) phone button menu to talk to a live person. The Sprint customer service rep was helpful and knew his stuff regarding phone, the plans and everything that I asked. Kudos to Sprint and their reps for being helpful; your results may vary, but being polite helps.I wondered about how waterproof the phone might be, so I tested it. Making sure that all of the ports were closed and the battery door was tight, I submerged the Kyocera Torque in a kitchen sink filled with room temperature water and waited about five minutes. That worked, so after making sure that everything was working, I did it again but for a measured time of 20 minutes. Dried it off, turned the phone on again and all was fine, and there was no evidence of water inside. Please note that I do not suggest that everyone test the Kyocera Torque this way, but someone had to do it.Call clarity is quite good on this phone, probably due to the \"advanced smart sonic receiver technology\" on this device. Bluetooth pairing was easy and necessary as I wanted to use my Plantronics Voyager Legend Bluetooth Headset when cycling. The GPS system worked well with the mapping application.On the downside, found that the 5MP camera was nothing to rave about. Maybe I've been spoiled by the 8MP camera in my Samsung Galaxy S III with its burst shot mode and Full HD 1080p video, but the images from the Kyocera Torque were not as good, even comparing them side by side. Its 4-inch 800 x 480 pixel screen is bright, but the 4.8-inch HD 1280 x 720 pixel is far superior, especially for those who wear corrective vision.\u25c6 Summary:The Kyocera Torque is unquestionably a ruggedized phone, and it will take drops and banging around far better than most. Within reasonable expectations, it's a good and very sturdy product that should easily meet the needs of those who are looking for such a device. The direct Direct Connect push-to-talk feature is good for those who need it and remember the old Nextel phones with their walkie-talkie style communication, but I found it to be an annoyance that could easily be disabled. Beyond my minor gripes, this is a good phone, and one that I'll keep it as a backup for cycling and for outdoor use... and for those applications, it's quite good.JW \u25aa 4/16/2013", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Amanda Knauff", "ReviewID": "R3PNZ6JLGCL3UG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this phone for my husband and he loves it.

You can install up to 32GB of additional SD storage as well and set this as the default install location, but.... many applications will still install to the default \"0.99 GB Internal Storage\" location or will have the option to \"Move to SD Card\" grayed out.Enter the big problem.

My children have messed around with this phone and I never felt that it was so fragile it would break easily.Like most phones you pick up now days, this phone is fairly easy to use.

I replaced it with a different device due to two major software flaws.During the 3rd week of owning it (after the 14 trial period ended) the phone began random power cycling (resetting). This happened many times including during a call to the repair tech at the purchasing store. The other issue was that the phone 'forgot' my email accounts. When this happened I lost the ability to check my email through my phone, all of my contacts were gone (not actually stored in phone, only read from email accounts), and any apps with data synced with my email were no longer associated with my account.The power cycling issue was supposed to be resolved with an update that was installed at my time of purchase, Feb 2014. This update did not fix the issue. Upon arriving to the store of purchase the repair tech informed me that since they were not a corporate location and I was outside my 14 day trial they could not replace the phone without witnessing the issue. Since the problem happened at random we tried to induce it by using the phone, making and receiving calls, downloading apps, using apps, etc. to no avail.The email account issue was also not able to be duplicated. According to the repair tech Kyocera issues a bulletin regarding this issue saying that they were \"working on it\" and that a fix would be out \"soon\".So since the store was not able to help me I called Sprint Customer Care to see what they could do to help.The Sprint agent I spoke with told me that they would not be able to authorize a replacement phone at my location due to my store being a Preferred Retailer, ie; non-corporate, store. I was then advised that I should try to convince the retailer replace my phone. With another Torque that may or may not have the same issues. I explained that this is unacceptable to me. I then asked if it was possible to replace my phone with a different device. I was informed that Sprint would be happy to sell me any one of four refurbished phones for prices varying from free to $99.99. I wrote the model numbers down to do some research and hung up with Sprint.I forget the specific models but they were all two to three years old and not even comparable to the equipment specifications in the Kyocera. Upon calling Sprint back I expressed that I felt insulted with their offer of outdated equipment to replace the malfunctioning equipment that I used my upgrade to get.The only solutions offered by the Sprint agent were to a) make the retailer replace my phone or b) buy a new phone on the Easy-Pay plan and pay full retail price over the next two years.Since the retailer's policy only permitted replacement of a device when they could witness the issue this was not a viable solution. (Even if they did witness and replace I would still only have a different device with possible software issues.)As far as the Easy-pay plan is concerned all of the smart phones Sprint offers at this particular location ranged from $449.99 to $599.99.In essence Sprint told me that I wasted my upgrade on a garbage device and signed a new contract and now that I have problems they can't help me. Or in other words Sprint says, \"We're shifty, we took your money, now go get bent sucker.\"Sprint did try to make amends by offering me a $40 credit for two months on my bill. After further prodding they offered to extend half of my rebate on the Kyocera ($25) that I would not receive because I didn't have the phone on my account for 90 days.In the end I spent probably 6 hours on the phone with customer care agents and was constantly shifted form one to the next. None of the agent were able to offer any solutions and I was told time and again that since i was outside of my 14 trial period \"It is the responsibility of the retailer to replace your phone.\"tl:dr, This phone is an aggravating pile of worthless silicon and lithium and Sprint has lost another customer.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product.", "Author": "cheffuzzy311", "ReviewID": "R3RBDMPFUDKL5U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its a beast,  does everything, and water doesnt affect it.

Therefore, in practice, as an emergency phone i only turn it on when i'm using it (even though of course i take a huge power hit to take a GPS fix from a cold boot-up).one thing this phone could really use is a built-in eyelet to allow better tethering of this phone either to a backpack or article of clothing or whatever.  that's a big oversight for a ruggedized phone.however, i'n general i'm very happy with this phone for its backup uses.  for those wanting to use this as their everyday phone i suggest you give it a good think through and see and use it in person at a store first.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Nice (Especially If You Don't Need The Latest Tech Or Gadgets)", "Author": "M.A. Hallisey \"Potius mori quam foedari!\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y1WAR231HDI7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Kyocera Torque arrived yesterday and I've spent about 10 hours going over it. Initial verdict: a solid performer that has some real pluses and a few downsides (full disclosure: my review is written having come from the HTC EVO LTE (Sprint), the Samsung Galaxy S4, Black (Sprint), and the Samsung Galaxy Note II, Titanium (Sprint).The Torque comes surrounded by a tough slightly-rubberized plastic case that seems to be somewhere between the OtterBox Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Frustration-Free Packaging - Black (Black/Black) and the OtterBox Defender Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Frustration-Free Packaging - Black (Black/Black) (but it doesn't have the holster like the Defender case does. For that I'm ordering the Kyocera Torque Case with Belt Clip Holster Combo by PROTECH for Kyocera e6710). Even with the integrated shock protection, the Torque is very light and feels really good in the hand (doesn't want to slip out or feel overly small or large). All the buttons seem well-placed (save one). The Torque supposedly is (at least) water-resistant (but I'm not going to check out that feature!).Speaking of buttons/keys, like the HTC Evo the \"back\" key is on the left and the \"settings\" key is on the right (Samsung has the opposite setup). Given that I use the S4 and Note 2 now, it was awkward for a few minutes as I got re-accustomed to the \"reversed\" setup. Unlike the Samsungs and the HTC, the keys (to include the \"home\" key) are \"hard keys\" (meaning they are real buttons, not virtual buttons). I mentioned button placement (above) and said that I found all but one satisfactory. The \"save one\" button is the DirectConnect (\"walkie-talkie\") button on the left side. Marked by yellow (I guess so that it can be found easier?), it was found far too easily as I used the phone. Granted, I have never used a DirectConnect phone, so it could be that I wouldn't keep stumbling over it as I got used to it. At this point, however, I disabled it so as not to drive me mad (you can map the button to perform a number of functions if you don't have or plan to get DirectConnect). On the top are the speaker and power/lock buttons, as well as the headphone jack. On the right side is a camera button. On the left side is the volume and DC buttons. On the bottom is the charging/micro USB port. The SIM card and microSD card are accessed by \"unscrewing\" the back panel (the SD card slot is accessed by removing the battery). All possible water entry points (charging port, headphone jack, buttons, and back panel) have rubber/rubberized seals.Speaking of the back panel, exercise caution. The back plate is thin plastic and the screw is not really a screw: it is a silver-coated plastic knob that you turn 1/4 turn with a coin to open the back. If the screw slot is north-south (up-down), then the back plate is locked; if east-west (left-right), then unlocked. You unlock the back plate by turning the screw 1/4 turn counter-clockwise. The screw stays on the back as the panel is removed.The OS (as of the writing of the review) is Android 4.1.2 (higher than what the Amazon page says it has). I was pleasantly surprised to find a phone that has ZERO bloatware and minimal (if at all) skinning. Compared to what the larger manufacturers like Samsung, HTC, or LG put on top of the OS, I found this minimalist approach refreshing. As such, I was surprised to see the number of available ringtones and notification tones (a rough estimate: 80 ringtones to choose from!).The touchscreen is very responsive,though not flawless (I found that it did not always respond as fast as my S4, but that could be the result of the thicker glass used (?). The camera is what should be considered the absolute minimum these days (actually, I find the 5.0 MP rear and 1.2 MP front cameras substandard). The literature says is takes up to a 32GB microSD card, but it may take a larger one (I may check that out later on at some point). But with only a 5.0 MP camera, I'm not sure you would need anything larger than 32GB (I also can't imagine anyone loading this phone up with music or videos).The RAM (only 1 GB)/ROM (only 4GB) combo means that the reasonable 1.2 GHz CPU doesn't have much to play with (so don't plan on loading up on zillions of apps unless you want to fiddle around with an SD card manager app), but what it does it seems to do well.The phone hooked up to my wireless network without issue (I wish that there was a \"show password\" option in that I huse a very long password and if you're not careful it's easy to make a mistake and cause you to re-enter the password). I have not yet had the opportunity to put the GPS function to the test or use the phone in fringe coverage areas to see how good the reception/antenna is. If the performance is substandard I'll update this review (if you don't read anything negative, then all was/is well).In the end, the Kyocera Torque is a solid performer for (as the Amazon description says) someone who works in construction, spends a significant amount of time in the great outdoors, or a parent with young kids who might be worried about slopping baby stuff onto the phone. It doesn't promise much beyond being a solid, rugged phone, but what it does promise to do it does well. I have been more than pleasantly surprised and look forward to putting it through its paces (and as I am out on the water quite a bit kayaking, this phone seems to be just the ticket!).", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Angelica Priem", "ReviewID": "R30LO08XC5KXA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone!

First thing i love is that the speaker is very loud.  I can hear a phone call from the other side of the worksite with ease when it's turned up high.  The vibration also works great, even in my winter coat pocket I can feel it if I accidentally forget to turn up the volume.  The version of Android is nice and clean as well, there's still some typical Sprint BS apps that they add, but in all it's pretty decent.I will note that you absolutely have to get a microSD card immediately...if you don't have one order one or pick one up with this phone.  (side note: always make sure it's a class 10 card so you don't have to worry about speed...I've had problems with trying to use cheap SD cards in phones with disastrous results!)  The phone doesn't come with much empty space to use as storage, so be sure to add however much memory you need, since it's cheap-ish these days to buy memory, get a 32gb and be done with it!The phone seems durable as could be.  I'd love to find a cradle charger though as I don't like removing the cover to plug the phone in to charge it.  I'm able to get 2 days out of a single charge with medium use...I should note that I'm 95% of the time in 3g areas only, so I have no clue how long the battery would last if I was kickin' it in 4G...shame on me for living outside of Sprint's good area!  The first thing I did with this phone (literally, as I was walking out of the Sprint store with it) involved an absolute downpour...with insane wind.  I was talking on the phone and just didn't worry at all about the phone getting wet...after losing several phones to water issues, I'm glad I'm not worried about that anymore!The last thing I'll say is that I disabled the PTT button on the side so it doesn't do anything.  I'm not a PTT subscriber, so that didn't concern me, but you can program it to do any number of things.  It is easy to hit that button accidentally, so telling it to do nothing was the best thing I could do.  Otherwise, I'm extremely happy with the Torque after a month!
