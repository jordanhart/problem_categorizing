It catches people's attention, browsing is fast and snappy. 8GB memory and GPS built in. wifi, 4G what more one can ask.HP has started to remove support for most of the great Palm products over last year. I doctored it and updated with the latest firmware from HP/Palm website. I also unlocked it paying a site $17, but now there are free unlocking site available which I used for my other Palm Pre devices. So I am not sure if paying extra for unlocked Veeris worth it. If you are technically saavy, I would suggest buy a locked one and unlock yourself. Otherwise get this phone. I also use it without SIM using developer mode, given below. Has plenty of space for music and volume is pretty good in the internal speaker. Touchstone capabilities are awesome. Unfortunately HP fumbled and stopped these line of products, but they are great and part of a history.Steps to bypass activation and use with just wifi: At the first screen to put SIM Card, using the keyboard type: BZ (those are the buttons for #*). dialer will appear. When the phone dialer appears use the screen to type: 3386633# and press dial. The phone will restart and you don't need a SIM card to use the phone. Use wifi for using like an ipod touch.", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE LOVE LOVE but sadly it is gone", "Author": "Carla", "ReviewID": "R12NHX6IV9IWPQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to get compliments on my small cute phone, since all smart phone are GIGANTIC.

The phone is well-built, the small keyboard is, surprisingly, very easy to use, and the WebOS operating system is fast and well-designed. I primarily use my phone to make calls, send text messages, check my email, play a game or two and do some light web browsing, and the HP Veer allows me to do all of this. I also love the small size as I don't like to carry a handbag, and this little phone fits so easily into any pocket. Overall, I'm really happy with this phone!", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "So disappointing.", "Author": "J. Grubic", "ReviewID": "R1OEFEMSNIHM67", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This operating system had such potential. The UI is beautifully designed and executed.However, the phone itself I'm learning to hate because the battery life (I bought it from this vendor on Amazon) is less than 24 hours. It's absolutely terrible.You'll also find the software available is woefully lacking.Additionally, the magnetic USB port on the Veer is not well thought out. You always have to keep this specific cable with you or you can't charge it (and you need to charge it often because the battery life is unacceptable). You get no audio port. You have to use a custom magnetic USB cable for that as well. Not included.I wanted to like this phone and I gave it every opportunity to impress me. It failed.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "The most difficult phone I have ever loved", "Author": "C \"C\"", "ReviewID": "RDAMQRJV61PGJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Wow.  I have just completed one of the most difficult technical challenges of my life:  getting this phone to have a working turn by turn GPS navigation system.I received the phone on January 8, and after working every single day on the problem I finally fixed it yesterday, January 27.To their credit, the seller did try to help, but they knew absolutely nothing about the phone and none of the HP help numbers could actually help.This two page forum illustrating all of the help I got from webOS users and the frustrating steps I went through to get the GPS to work is available here:[...] sorry, url was deleted by Amazon but search webosnation forums for the HP Veer GPS Navigation for 2014.Why did I spend 19 days feverishly working on this phone instead of returning it?Because of the Pros:*it is the only small phone available on the market for such a low price*it actually fits in my pocket for goodness sakes, unlike today's gargantuan ugly and awkward ipad sized phones, which means that I can carry it with me instead of leaving my old humungous phone on a table or in my backpack and missing important calls*it's fast, much faster than my old Android Galaxy S, which would take forever for any app to load and had a 3-10 second delay for any touch feature (and yes, I did minimize apps and streamline the system on the old phone as much as possible)*has great battery life*everything else works well, it synchs to all of my Gmail contacts and mail*it has a pull out typing pad (as I could never manage to press the right touchscreen letters and spent most of my time correcting my typing on my old phone)*last of all, it's adorably cuteCons:*I gave it 3 stars because I had to spend 19 days of research and extra money, when the phone is advertised as having a GPS navigation system (as opposed to simply a GPS location device; if it had been advertised correctly, I wouldn't have bought it), and it doesn't.You have to buy an extra expensive $40 app for a Ndrive map that actually allows the GPS to work, so the phone really costs around $124 if you want an actual working navigation system.*I had to disassemble the phone (which was a huge pain) and take out the battery to get it to work again after loading the new GPS program, as it froze immediately after*The numbers on the pull out typing pad are difficult to use, because you have to push a button to activate the number that is paired with the letter, and not only is that inconvenient, but often if you don't press the number activation button long enough or if about a second lapses between the time you press the activation button before pressing the letter/number button, it reverts back to the letter, which is pretty annoying.Overall, it was worth it, for me.  Others might not share my opinion, but at least I can be thorough and inform potential buyers what they are in for.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super", "Author": "DENISE SALAZAR", "ReviewID": "R11T3NTKZYZH31", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this as a gift for my husband and he loved it...he said it was the most managable phone he's seen in a long time.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "A good s/o...
