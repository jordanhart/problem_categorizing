Why did they stop making this line??", "Author": "odin4905", "ReviewID": "R2F2AWSD5C190N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for almost 4 years and loved it the whole time. I have never wanted a smartphone as I hate touchscreens and love speed and media on my phone.I tried a smartphone once and everything you want to do is based on if you pushed the area just right and it still happens after about a half second later. This is because a \"push\" on a touchscreen is registered once you lift your finger from the screen. So the simple task of dialing a number took me about 15 seconds minimum. On the enV3 I could do it in 4 or 5 seconds.Texting, was of course, a nightmare. They tried to help this by making the phone fill in rest of a word automatically to save time, but it often gets it wrong and I have to spend time deleting and retexting it anyway. Overall, just a hassle in every way. The one thing they do better is internet browsing, but I never need to browse internet when I'm on the go. NEVER. I have a PC at home and I can't think of a single thing I would need to do away from there on the internet.Anyways, with the enV3 I can type as fast as my thumbs can go and don't have to handle it like I'm holding a small computer. It is durable. I must have dropped it hundreds of times over 3 years and only once did it show any damage. That was very recently, which is why I'm here looking for a new one. My old one still works, but one hinge is completely snapped off so its just flopping around.Call sound quality is great. On ear or on speakerphone. No more to be said it has no problems. If you get this phone and it has a problem, you might want to replace it because mine does not.It also has a very good camera for taking pics and videos, I don't use those a whole lot but the pics always look great and videos are a bit laggy, but surprisingly good if you hold it steady. Also, when viewing pictures on the phone, it has an automatic enhancing feature when you zoom in on the pictures. This was amazing to me because I can't find anything on the internet to do this for pictures on my PC, at least not for free.I use mine to listen to music very very much. In the shower I sometimes set it up high on a shelf right near so I can sing along haha. The sound quality while it is open is really good, and only gets bad if there is a lot of bass or many instruments playing loudly all at once, because come on its only stereo and doesn't have any size to make a rumbling bass sound. But most songs you won't even notice this. I doubt any phone does it better anyways as no phone has more than 2 speakers that I know of.I have a 4GB Sandisk Memory Card for mine and it has over 300 songs right now, as well as a few videos and over 50 pictures I took, with over 1.5GB left to spare. I don't plan on filling it up ever, songs don't take much space.After the first 2 years, my phone started slowing down a bit. It's still very fast compared to anything I've seen anyone with, especially any smartphones with touch screens, but it just takes a few more seconds when loading music or when I write an extremely long text(like 100 words or more). Another thing that has gotten worse with age is the battery life. After 2 years it was running out quicker between each full charge. When it was new it would go for well over 5 days day and night with around 20 short calls and around 150 texts of different sizes.These days I have to charge it after 2 or 3 full days, and if I talk on phone for more than an hour straight, it might lose all battery just because of the heat of the phone for some reason. Texting still doesn't bother it much unless I do it nonstop for a half hour or something. Music barely does anything either. I will recommend you DO NOT get a new replacement battery if this happens. I did this and the new battery did the same thing. I think it is just the phone getting old.The last thing I can think of to mention is the interface and menus. I have read other people's reviews all over internet and it seems you either find the menus confusing or you are like me and think they are the best you ever saw in a phone. The main menu can be changed if you want but its default is a grid of 9 pictures that each go to most of the phones features. One goes to messages, one to Web, one to Tools and Options, one to Contact List, you get the picture.Then most other menus are just a list. You can use arrows up and down or just push the number of the option you want to choose on the list. To me this is as simple as can be, but I guess some people find it confusing because there is so much the phone can do, the amount of options becomes overwhelming. Not sure.The backlight is always good and very bright. Hasn't dimmed at all in 3 years. There is internet of some sort but I don't use it because I am not on Verizon, I use Page Plus, so I can't do anything that requires internet since this is a Verizon phone. Also, there's just nothing for me to do. Apparently you could check email and certain sites have a smaller version made for earlier phones, but I wouldn't want to pay for data even if I was on Verizon. What a waste of moolah they are though.Please everyone, check out Page Plus. It is the same signal as Verizon, and you will save a lot. I save $60 a month. WOW. That is just me one single line. If you have a family and are all on Verizon, PLEASE stop wasting your money. I know it sounds impossible but there is actually no downside at ALL. Sorry for the advertising.I bought the phone when it was new straight from Verizon for $300. I know, I was kind of foolish with my money back then, but I still don't regret it because this phone has never let me down and does more than I could have wanted because when I bought it I was just looking for a texting mania phone. The only thing I'm afraid of is that I won't be able to buy enough of these to last me the rest of my life. Sounds crazy, right? But if the way of the future is touch screens or something worse... gulp then what is a guy like me who wants everything to go fast and simple.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "I LOVE this Phone - Gonna Buy Another One! :)", "Author": "K. Hansen", "ReviewID": "R2LL7504UR9M78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my first enV3 (the burgundy red one) for well over 3 yrs, and it's finally showing its age. I keep getting \"invitations\" from Verizon to upgrade, but since I'm ditching the husband attached to the account, I don't want to be stuck with another 2-yr contract on the line - plus, I can't get the enV3 thru Verizon anymore. :pI agree w/other reviewers; if you're looking for a solid phone for calling, texting and taking decent pix, this is the one you want. I bought an SD card for added memory because I take a LOT of pix with my phone; more on that later.I was dragged into the 21st century reluctantly when it came to texting; the fact that I have a teen-age daughter finally made it a necessity. The QWERTY keyboard is easy and comfortable to use, and the size of the inside screen is great for these (ahem!) somewhat aging eyeballs to see without squinting. I like the feel of the phone itself, and it fits into the front pocket of my jeans perfectly. As another reviewer mentioned, I'm not crazy about touch-screen phones because they just seem too finicky for me - and yes, I butt/pocket dial now and then - but I could put a locking code on if I felt like it. It just doesn't happen that often to matter to me, I guess.I've had to replace the battery only once in all this time - and even ordered that thru Amazon upon the advice of a rep at a Verizon store. She told me I'd get it about 75% cheaper here, and she was right! And here's a trick she taught me that might help some of you with battery and/or shut-off issues: She folded a small, thin, piece of plain paper into a narrow rectangle and placed it under the battery (not near any connecting points) so the battery would fit a little more snugly, and that completely eliminated the problems I'd been having with my phone shutting off unexpectedly and not holding a charge.I use my cell phone as my \"main\" phone; therefore I almost never turn it off, and would go to sleep with it plugged into the charger. I've only recently learned that leaving a phone plugged in beyond the point when it's fully charged wears on the battery and will lessen its life. But - I need to have my phone on, and I need it to be charged, so for now, I try to pay more attention during the day, charge it then, and unplug promptly. I've also heard that you're supposed to allow the battery to drain completely down before recharging it, but again, that's just not feasible for me. I plan to get an extra battery at the same time I buy the blue version - that should cut down on those hassles in my situation.Now about the pix: I'm constantly amazed by the awesome ones I'm able to take on a PHONE(!) - and when necessary, it has a great little editing package; zooming, brightening, cropping, etc. For my purposes, I often think it's actually easier (and faster) to modify pix right then and there, rather than mess around later when I transfer pix to the computer. And, when I go to upload to the computer, I very seldom feel the need \"tweak\" them because what I did on the phone looks great. One admission; this would be the only time it could use a little bit bigger screen to more easily see finer details, but even so - that's negligible compared to all the capabilities.I've used quite a few phones over the years, but this is the one that I have truly ENJOYED owning - and the one everyone wants after they've borrowed it! :D", "Date": "October 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cellphone", "Author": "DC", "ReviewID": "RC785K3UX8X0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone with the intention of skipping having to go to the Verizon store.

I got mine before Verizon made it mandatory for you to buy a data plan with some phones, so beware that this is one of those phones. The keypad is excellent for texting. And you generally don't have to worry about pocket dialing with the front keypad. The camera takes very nice pictures for a phone with a 3mp camera. Memory is not a big issue; just buy a MicroSD card if you find you need more. BUT... there are some things wrong with it. Occasionally, mine will turn off when i try to take pictures. I will turn it back on and try to take the picture again, and it will just turn off again. Then it will work fine a little later. This can obviously be very annoying and inconvenient. Also, I have found that the reminder doesn't always do its job. I have mine set for every two minutes, but sometimes I won't know I have a text message because my reminder didn't work. This is not that big of a deal, though. When you are in a no service area, the phone will not display the time. Once again, inconvenient but not deal breaking.

I feel like an idiot in the store and the salespeople really aren't interested in me once they know I'm a Luddite.I ordered this phone thinking, at that great price, if it works for only a year I am still ahead.

My guess is that for 3 phones, we spent no more at the store and we'll save more than $10/month, or $120/year, for each phone with full capability but without a data plan.Warning:  Verizon did automatically put the phone on a data plan.  I had called in advance to ensure the phone does NOT require that extra cost.  When I called to get the plan taken off, the Verizon call-center person was fairly quick to recognize their error and take it off data.

I couldn't take it anymore on the flip phone with the T9 texting even with supposedly predictive text method.  So my contracts on all my phones w. Verizon were all up and I didn't want to re-enroll and commit to another 2-year contract and realized I was really overpaying for my minutes/texts in my Verizon plan.  I am so glad I shopped around for no-contract phones and found this one for my MVDO (PagePlus) that runs on Verizon's network for way less money.Everyone wondered why I didn't get an iPhone or a cool smartphone.  I'll tell you why.  I have an iPad already.  If I want apps, I'll use my iPad.  I just want a more convenient phone for texting than a flip phone.  Well, boy did I get what I bargained for.  Instead of paying $500 for a no-contract smartphone, I paid about $70 on Amazon for a pretty darn full-featured \"basic\" phone.  It has a lot of cool features.First and foremost, I absolutely love the hinged full QWERTY keyboard style of this phone.  When i want to talk, I can see the numbers and just dial and talk (I have another phone on Consumer Cellular that has a tiny little keyboard on the face of the phone and I can't see the numbers without my glasses, so this LG enV3 VX9200 is great for seeing the numbers!).  And if I do want to text, I just open the hinge and there's a nice QWERTY keyboard with a good tactile feel on the keys, they're separated enough so that you rarely type the wrong key, they're slightly raised, good feel, and they have great keyboard features, like the most commonly used punctuation marks right on the keyboard (comma, exclamation point, question mark, apostrophe, quote, etc.).  All you have to do is hit the \"symbol\" key to tell the phone you want to use those characters.  No more meandering through 5 menus just to get to the list of these punctuation marks.  And a quick messaging key, and a \"favorites\" key (just hit Favorites, select your contact, and start typing the text or even calling them).  It's easy to type on, and it lays just about flat if you put it down.I have a Mac so I worried about getting the contacts on the phone.  One thing that was a little weird and surprising is that I had expected to be able to just put the microSD card in the phone and transfer my contacts from my old phone to this LG but for some reason I couldn't figure out how to get it to recognize the card for that.  It does see my pictures and music but not my contacts.  So the worry part was about finding a Mac-compatible software program I could use to transfer the contacts from my Mac or from the file I'd exported (CSV) from Verizon's backup assistant.  Well, thankfully, that wasn't an issue because I gave the bluetooth file transfer a shot.  Usually my Mac doesn't pair with these cell phones, the older ones, but it saw the phone, and I was able to send the VCF contact files to the phone from the Mac via bluetooth.  And so that means if I really wanted to (and I don't), I could even use my iPad keyboard and bluetooth pair it to this phone if I wanted to do any serious typing.  Everything else on this phone is a bonus - voice commands, IM, Internet (which I don't plan to use - again, i have an iPad, this phone is for calling and texting).Voice quality is great, bells and whistles are great for a phone in this price range.  You really get a lot for your money.

Overall, I have been impressed with it's quality. I chose this phone for 2 main reasons: I wanted a cell phone with very good battery life and one that could take quality pictures (for a cell phone) and save them to external memory. There are some cons to this phone but I have not had any issues with the phone randomly turning off.Pros:-Battery life; My last cell phone was also an LG and it had great battery life, as does this phone. After a year of use it still can last me about a full week on a single charge while using it mostly for occasionally taking pictures and texting (I do not send or receive calls often).-Camera; I knew what to expect of a 3mp camera and this phone has pleasantly exceeded my expectations. I mostly take pictures of animals. My pets and animals at a shelter I volunteer at. Often times I will take a picture with this phone that blows me away. I did not expect to be able to take pictures of animals that are running towards me to turn out perfectly clear and with no blur. But this happens quite frequently. It struggles more with sideways motion, but not as much as I would have thought. The camera is definitely the most impressive feature of the enV3.-Texting; I like the feels of the keys and the full keyboard makes texting a breeze. I also love that it can store a lot of texts before you need to start erasing some. I currently have 430 texts in my inbox and it says it is 90% full. There is a \"Favorites\" button that lets you quickly start messaging any person you add to it, which is a nice feature for frequent texters.-Camcorder; Nothing special about this but it works well for what it is and I like that you can capture videos for up to an hour for saving or up to 30 seconds for sending(and saving).-Layout; You can customize the menu screens a few different ways to look how you want, menu navigation is easy once you get the hang of it, and there is a shortcuts button(the right arrow on the inside keypad) that lets you quickly bring up 4 different applications of your choosing.-Calling; I have no complaints about sound or voice quality.Cons:- Pocket pressing/random button pressing; This phone does have a keyguard function that you can activate if you want where it forces you to press the OK button once or twice in order to unlock your phone. This should prevent pocket presses, but it doesn't. I always have it on to press OK twice since I carry the phone in my front pocket and often wear jeans. Still, I will frequently find random numbers punched into my phone and even find them saved as contacts sometimes. If this happens to you, I urge you to go to the voice command settings and turn off the voice command funtion on the CLR key. Otherwise you will occasionaly hear \"Please say a command!\" coming from your pocket.- Picture viewing annoyance; Now, I do like the ability to view pictures on the big inner screen and the zoom function works great. But, there is a weird issue when viewing pictures that gets on my nerves. When you click on a picture to view it, the picture goes full screen but the quality changes. It looks less defined, blurrier, and the contrast changes a tad so the picture looks too bright or too dark. If you then zoom in on your picture, this issue goes away and the picture looks like it should. Note that this issue does not affect your photos, it is just the way the phone presents them. This issue is annoying to me because I like to show off pictures I've taken to other people and in order to make them look the way they should, I have to zoom in on each picture a little bit.Conclusion:This phone excels with the features/functions that are most useful to me and has many positive aspects. The few negative aspects that it does have are annoyances that I will have to deal with, but they are minor. Overall, I am impressed with the enV3 and would definitely buy one again if I were to lose or damage it. If I could, I would rate the enV3 closer to 4.5 stars.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the basics.", "Author": "Wannabe Intellect \"DW\"", "ReviewID": "R1MV885330TL1I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The LG enV3 is perfectly fine for what I need.

My Dads and my husbands phones both work great.  They came in new like it had stated, and shipping was fast.  My phone, however, did not come in new.  The shipping was great.  The phone worked perfectly at first and starting messing up a few months later.  I've had the same phone for 2 years, and it never messed up. So, I know it wasn't the phone itself, just a crappy phone applewireless sent.  My phone wouldn't charge so I had to charge, the camera/video only worked 10% of the time, and it froze every time I opened to call or text.  I bought a new one, hoping this new one would work like my Dads and husbands did.  I haven't activated it yet.  I bought this 'new'.  It is NOT new.  The stickers are all messed up.

However, when I received the phone and attempted to activate it online, the website would only allow me to choose from either the $60 or $70 prepaid smartphone plans. As far as I'm concerned, the Env3 is considered a \"basic phone\". After calling customer support and explaining my situation they told me that since it has an HTML Browser is it considered an enhanced device and therefore requires the extra data charge. I also went to a local VZW store to see if they could activate it without the data plan, but to no avail.

But instead they sent me what looked like a new phone but was obviously a rebuild of poor quality with tons of problems.  Bought this off Amazon and after having it a couple of weeks I finally used the headset plugin so I could listen to calls with earphones. Nope. Doesnt work. The connector where you plug your headphones in is clearly defective , likely broken away from the cell phone's motherboard and so it doesnt work. Several of the buttons stick too (but they work \"OK\"). Pretty much a rip off. I think with these rebuilds (or actually I think this one was even advertised as new), you get the luck of the draw. Some are going to work well and some don't. Mine doesn't. I lost out this time. So, just check out your entire phone very closely before you toss the packaging and before the timeframe in which returns are allowed expires and you might be OK...assuming they handle returns well. I wouldnt know since I didnt discover the major problems until it was too late.  My true advice is to not buy these cheaply priced phones on amazon where the deal is to good to be true. If it sounds too good to be true, the phone you get will likely have problems.If the phone were new it would have its own flaw or two. Mainly the outside screen is so small...it's worthless.

I don't want a touch screen phone.  I love the design of this phone.  Unfortunately, I received a lemon (actually two lemons).  On the first phone, the beautiful black color on the phone (near the screen, above the keyboard) was chipped.  The phone did not appear to be new even though I was paying for a new phone.  The vendor quickly sent a replacement phone, but it looked as if someone damaged the inside of the phone (where the battery goes) with a sharp object.  There was also some damage to a small plate in the phone (one end slightly sticking up as if it had been forced up).  The front of the second phone had scratches that made the phone look like it had been used.  I returned both phones.More bad news, I bought the phone as a bundle.  Amazon \"suggested\" the items in the bundle.  Amazon sent a pre-paid label for the return of the phone and car charger, but I am faced with having to pay to ship the other accessories back to their vendors.  The cost of return shipping would be equivalent to or greater than the cost of the other items.  This would make no sense since I had to pay for some of the items to be shipped to me in the first place.  Nevertheless, I don't need the accessories since I don't have the phone.I shall just donate the new screen protectors and the new body glove to a non-profit organization like Goodwill or Salvation Army.  They will not fit a phone that is shaped differently (right now, I don't have a cell phone).  Buyer, beware of Amazon bundles.  If all items are from Amazon, GREAT!  If any item is outsourced and from another vendor, you may get stuck with part of a bundle.  It is not my fault that the phone I received was damaged.  I really lost money on this deal.It would have been nice if Amazon had allowed me to send the phone AND accessories to them.  The accessories were unused but appeared to be in good condition.  I am certain that Amazon could have sold the items.  This way Amazon would take some responsibility for items they \"suggested\" the consumer buy together.

We've disabled Internet capability on his phone, but that worked too when we tested it before turning it off.  The only downside of this phone is that the battery it came with doesn't hold a charge longer than a day.

I finally guessed the PIN and it was 0000. I don't know if this is a factory setting or if I bought a new phone that was actually used, I can't be sure. All I know is I could find nothing in the documentation that referenced a default lock on the phone. If this is my mistake, someone please correct this review, I want to be fair.The second and bigger issue is the battery. It won't hold a charge at all. Fortunately, the old battery in her old phone was still in useable condition so we just swapped it out. I didn't bother contacting the seller yet again because quite frankly, it wasn't worth my time and most likely, I'd get stuck with shipping charges again.If you are thinking about buying, I would move on to something else and buy from somewhere else.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Florence Rastelli", "ReviewID": "R2NSG4XQN1VN1U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Received phone and was thrilled cause I  had one before.

After my first two, they did an upgrade where the battery was not the back of the phone; they put a case over the battery.  This does not help anything.  I also experience very slow text messaging.  The phone cannot keep up with how fast I enter in the letters.  I signed up to receive emails on my phone and if I turn it on silent, the vibrate setting still goes off for my emails.  This is very disturbing when I am in a meeting.  The only good thing about this phone is that is it indestructible.  I have dropped this phone so many times I cannot even count it on both my hands.  I have put many chips and dents in the side of this phone.  (This is not the reason why my phone shuts off.  It did this way before I dropped it).

The one I lost was given to me by Verizon after the one I originally purchased was recalled. The defect in the first phone (also an LG enV3) was that it kept shutting down every time I opened the phone to text, and sometimes it just powered down for no apparent reason at all.  About two months after I purchased this replacement phone on Amazon it began doing the same thing as the recalled model.  It is so frustrating and inconvenient to have a phone that just keeps powering down randomly.  I can't depend on it - it is not reliable.  I miss phone calls & texts, the alarm clock feature is a roll of the dice, and it really is inconvenient to be cut off mid-conversation constantly.

However, it was NOT NEW NOR WAS IT REFURBISHED.  it was NOT IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION when it was received.  I paid $70 plus dollars, shipping and HAD TO PURCHASE A NEW CHARGER CORD....yet my phone DID NOT WORK PROPERLY. The POWER ON/OFF BUTTON DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY.  You must press it and hold it down several times before it actually comes on. .  When it does decide to turn on....the Verizon logo and sound is in slow motion and sounds as if it is dying.  There is something obviously WRONG with the POWER BUTTON.  The CHARGER CORD which came with the phone also presented a problem.  When using it...a message appeared on the phone indicating WRONG CORD BEING USED FOR THIS PHONE.  I have since read other reviews for this vendor and other people have had the same problem. I am a Senior Citizen and believe you should CHECK OUT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION....B E F O R E...YOU SELL IT TO ANOTHER PERSON.....NOT OFFER HELP AFTER THE FACT.  I decided to give this vendor and the phone the benefit of a doubt. I purchased a NEW POWER CORD and tried  the phone for several weeks to see if the POWER BUTTON problem would somehow resolve itself.  IT DID NOT!  I did email this vendor and explained my problems.  I did not have much confidence my problems would be resolved with another phone should I choose to return this one. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION HAS TRANSPIRED.

It is a sturdy phone and has charged well. I have had it for almost 2 months now and I am very pleased with this product. After purchasing this product, I went and read some of the negative reviews from others who have purchased from this company and at first was a little nervous about what I would receive.
