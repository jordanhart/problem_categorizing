I got it to develop some java applications for and ended up loving it. I use my T-mobile SIM in the phone so get all of my services including internet, email, messaging, and java app's. If you go to [...] you will find a lot of games and applications for this phone. The only thing missing in my opinion is an FM radio, most Nokia's have them so not sure why this one doesn't. Yes, I love to listen to radio especially when I am working or just commuting on the bus to work. This phone is great and is a fantastic value.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Camera\nText Messaging\nSpeaker Phone\nmyFaves capable\nPicture Messaging...and much more", "Name": "Nokia 1680 T-Mobile Complete Phone--Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dZRgSK%2BrL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002U4P8JW"}}
