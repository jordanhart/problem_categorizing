Slight reception issues outside of major metropolitan areas, some dead spots in small cities due to the tri-band, but overall surprisingly better than expected (we use AT&T;/Cingular).  No problems with SIM card interface.  Not a phone for tech junkies although the whole touch screen is pretty slick.  Camera is actually better than I thought.  Has flash but not auto.  Does come with earphones, a 128MB card and beautiful packaging.  USB port works fantastic just like flash drive for data transfer to desktop.  You WILL stick out like a sore thumb using this thing - and love every minute of it!  Highly recommend it, but do check out tri-band reception in your area first to avoid major disappointment.", "Date": "September 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "nice product", "Author": "Naeemul H.

Sometime it really takes a while to dial a number and you have to repeatedly touch the number until the phone recognized what you are doing ..........In addition to this, when dialing voicemail, while listening to the actual message very often the phone feels the heat from your ear and dials the nearest number (eg. 7 to delete the message before you are even done listening to it).There seems to be a recurring issue with software when the screen freezes and you need to take out the battery and turn it back on to work.Last but not least, after about 4-5 month of use the sound in my phone completely disappeared it's like it is on mute - except that it's not. Still rings but you can't have a conversation with anyone because you do not hear them and they cannot hear you.... I will try and see if I can get my money back although it might be a little too late.My advise - avoid this phone. There are other phones out there - do your research and get one that works.", "Date": "August 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "iPhone user , Now Prada user....", "Author": "Sandy \"Sandy\"", "ReviewID": "R2XE5NT1ROTYGX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say I am a die hard Mac head, I was in the line for the Apple iPhone on release day, and walked home with one... I love the iphone and its amazing BUT I don't like the size of it for my needs a bit to heavy and large to keep in a jeans pocket.I bought the Prada and Happy I did perfect size, and soooo Light!The screen is bright and clear, the pictures also come out wonderful as does the video camera Mode,Not having a bit of trouble at all, if you need to enter numbers for company's, you just hit the profile button and up pops the dial pad, easy as pie!In closing, I really love the Prada phone, it was the first touchscreen, and it works well.I live in the sticks(on edge of a forest) and this phone gets much better reception then my iphone, same mobile company, same location.I get 5 bars in most locations, and so far the battery has lasted a full 2 day with still have a charge left, very happy!I also posted a picture comparing the two!", "Date": "April 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Don't compare it to the iPhone and you'll love it.", "Author": "S. E. Burns \"gadget-crazed\"", "ReviewID": "R1OGW8EOQE09MI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is easy to think of this phone as being similar in appearance to the iPhone. In fact, most reviews compare this phone to the Apple iPhone. However, I don't agree with that at all. Really all that these phones share is a touchscreen interface. The LG Prada is in fact, a more traditional cell phone. It's features are simple and pretty much what you'd expect out of a cell phone. I like that it is light and love the interface. However, be warned the interface also requires that you are always touching the screen for something. Without a tactic feel for buttons or numbers, this phone is almost impossible to use while driving or any other task that also requires your attention. (The truth is you shouldn't be fiddling with any phone while driving). The sound quality is excellent on my network and I had very little trouble receiving texts, photos, etc. The camera on the phone is pretty good (I love all of the software features (including a flash). The MP3 player is very nice too, and unlike most phones, I can set my MP3s to be my ring-tone.Can you tell I like this phone after using it for a month?!I do. The only drawbacks to me are the very delicate scratchable screen and the need to continually touch the screen, whereas a RAZR or traditional cell usually has more dedicated buttons or you train yourself to know which buttons to push by tactile feel without having to look at the phone. OH and it is a little annoying that people ask you about the phone waaaay too much.", "Date": "September 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great looking phone, just few suggestions", "Author": "A.

The battery is not that great, I have to charge it overnight every day.3.

The one I have is a slip case in black Prada saffiano textured leather and is apparently easily recognizable by Prada fashionistas. I've read other reviews that reported the case scratches the phone. I haven't had that problem and I hope I won't. I like the pictured one better, the slip case requires you to completely remove the phone and if you are not careful, it could be easily lost.The phone itself is fun. Navigating through the menus is a but more tedious than the Razr (my previous phone) and the screen is almost impossible to see in bright sunlight. The touch screen is sensitive enough and does not require pressure, just contact. The camera is impressive and captures clear bright colors and has a flash which is actually just a little white spot light. The included earphones for the FM radio and MP3 player are Prada branded so it matches the phone and the available LG Prada Bluetooth ear piece which I guess is a good thing if you are looking to show off the fact that you have a Prada phone.The one thing that I am really disappointed with is the small cover piece that fits over the charger/ear piece connection slot. It feels very flimsy and just barely hangs on while the charger or ear piece is connected. I'm sure its just a matter of time before it breaks off. I think its great that the slot is covered but the small plastic piece is just not acceptable for a phone this expensive.If you're looking for the latest technology in a touchscreen phone that looks good, this is the one. I purchased this because its significanlty smaller and thinner than the iPhone, other than the size difference, there really shouldn't be any comparisons made between the two. Why be an iPhone clone when you can be a fashion victim!Of course if you're truly a fashion victim you would already know that Samsung has partnered with Giorgio Armani and released a touchscreen phone in Europe. It should be available in the USA sometime in 2008. I've also read that Levis will be coming out with a branded phone too. A joke?

But don't let anybody touch it or feel it, otherwise the magic will be over.Mine had the owner's manual completely in French.Buy it if you love the look and glamour, and don't care about the price or lack of functionalities.Also keep in mind that there is probably a reason for the fact that no carrier released it in the US market.", "Date": "September 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Purchase", "Author": "Felipe E.

The company that sent it did not include the instruction booklet in English. I received it in French. i wrote to them but not even an answer was returned. Fortunately enough the phone takes you by the hand and you can learn everything it does by playing with it a little. Very Friendly. On the down side, the lather casing it comes with that is supposed to protect it, has made horrible marks on the back of the phone and a couple on the front becuase when you slide the phone in, it rubs againts it. This only after using it for  a couple of weeks, Now I don't use the leather casing to prevent more ugly marks.

Subramanian \"Mash\"", "ReviewID": "R3VW95IGR4SX4F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros -- Great Looker, cant think of a better looking candy bar phone out there.- You cant stop playing with this beauty.- Touch screen is super sensitive, making the investment in touch screen experience worth it.- This is a good choice if you want to be different from the iphone crowd and also want to make a statement. (Iphone is too big for me, this is perfect length.)- Has a great battery Life. Easy to Navigate. Decent camera and video in bright lighting, FM radio, MP3 player, bluetooth music headset support, Micro SD card slot, 256 mb card included, speaker phone.- It is slightly slimmer and classier than the LG VU or other similar LG US models.- Most 3rd party Java program work on this without issues. (Be careful what you install though - reserch.)- If you intend to take it back to a country which supports all available bands, then it is a good choice.- Good clear voice quality (at my home where att signal is good).Bonus - The new 2008 Prada phone also looks like this one, so you can feel you are carrying something hip at a lower price.Cons -- On ATT, lack of one of the US frequency, really hits you hard. I used to get 1 bar with the sda at work (bad reception area inside building), none with the prada. No bars inside hotel room during our vacation in orlando.- If you have big hands (most men) it is difficult to grip solidly. Better to invest in that bluetooth headset. I dropped it on the road twice when someone brushed me.- Buttons not positioned for left handers like me.- Scratches easily, get that screen cover immedietly.- No wifi.- Existing software does not support flicking and sliding motions like the Iphone, you have to press buttons or use scroll bars. Note - The opera mini browser i installed did support flick scrolling vs using scroll bar, showing that the phone itself is capable.- Not enough 3rd party signed applications out there, quite a few free games though.- The landscape mode is not supported for video playback, only for pictures ???.- I have heard it does not play non MP3 music formats and also does not play back video recorded in some other devices like your camera. (have not tried myself).- Bad sync software. Does not recognize the phone easily.Tips -- Reserch ATT converage frequency in your home\\work area before buying.- Install opera mini java version.My Recommendation -If you are not keen on the Prada branding or your social group is not brand savvy, go for the feature rich and more advanced LG Vu made for the US with almost similar looks (slightly thicker). There are free phone deals out there with 2 year ATT contract without the data plan requirement via deals2buy \\ wirefly.

Call quality and reception are tops and this phone is a stunner. Finger prints are annoying, but expected. I constantly have people come over and ask about it. For the people that are bashing this phone, it isn't an Iphone and isn't intended to be. For those of you that are looking at the Apple \"product' and are desperate enough to use ATT, let me say one thing. I tried the Iphone for a week only because it was a demo. I wanted to see if the reviews were true. They are. The Iphone is the worst phone I've ever used. I'm talking about the phone features. Bells and whistles are nice when the phone doesn't lock up. Terrible call quality and iffy reception in medium strength signal strength areas. The speaker phone is a joke too. terrible sound levels. Too bad Apple decided to forget it was a phone first. I'm still laughing about all of you that overpaid, only to see them discontinue the model and then drop the price. You'll never learn.

For basic features that I need it is very well laid out.  You can do your stuff with minimal key strokes.  It is extremely user friendly.  I like the touch screen after getting used to it.  The big screen is great for showing your photos to others.  The small size and light weight make this a great solution for me.Drawbacks: Number one, the screen brightness even with power saving mode off, is poor and makes the phone very difficult to use in sunlight.  Brightness is nothing like that of the Nokia phones.  If I could improve one spec this would be it.  Number two, the very beautiful case scratches the screen badly.  Took a couple months to notice.  If you don't believe just feel the inside of the case.  Number three, the camera has a fairly substantial lag between pushing the shutter and taking the pic, probably 2 seconds.", "Date": "June 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great for simple phone functions only", "Author": "Amazon Feen", "ReviewID": "RSCPO53RY247R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great flashly, functional phone with limted range of features.

This phone is nothing better than a RAZR with a touch screen.Some quick observations from my limited time with it:*  Not quad band...ok, so it's a step lower than a RAZR.  I'm sure most people don't need 4 GSM bands, but it's always good to know you have them if needed.*  No QWERTY keyboard, uhh, what?!  The very reason I bought my iPhone was because of the QWERTY keyboard, and I looked at this phone prior to selling my soul to Apple.  The thought of triple tapping a touch screen to send text messages seemed utterly ridiculous.  \"The PRADA Phone offers a virtual numeric keypad, instead of a virtual QWERTY keyboard, for dialing of numbers and writing text messages (with help from the integrated T9 predictive text entry technology)\"...and they advertise this as a good thing.*  You can move the clock...ooh, stop the presses.  That's really a feature...and worth every dollar.  Not.*  I've never had a phone where the minute you touched it, it looked like it'd been manhandled by greasy mitts.  Its super polished look looks great...when untouched.  Usually, I've found phones to have a dulled finish, I thought for this reason.*  OS.  This is a phone.  Nothing more.  It's not a Blackberry replacement like the iPhone kinda/sorta is, and why it's considered iPhone's competitor, I don't understand.*  Size - it's almost the size of the iPhone with nowhere near the functionality.* Its storage can support a microSD card (this is a bonus over the iPhone), but this means it's an extra expense and is limited to card size.  There should be 8gig cards coming out soon.It's unique, but unique and cute does not equate to particularly being useful.  And for $600, you can get more of a phone than this.
