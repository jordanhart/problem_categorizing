What a great decision.  Picked the micro sim out of my iPhone and popped it into this one and many updates later (in true Microsoft fashion) I was running Windows Phone 8.1 and setting my home background, asking Cortana things, and generally just enjoying the heck out of this phone.For those that don't know Windows Phone 8.1 intros things like Cortana, a digital assistant like Siri and Google Now, customizable backgrounds, and otherwise just greatly improved the already good windows phone experience.It runs super snappy on the Lumia 925 with just the absolute slightest animation lag from time to time in menus.The phone is well designed although the plastic, er, polycarbonate back has a bit of a cheap, slippery feel.  Dedicated camera button is excellent.Everyone knows about the camera itself just to sum up comparable to the iPhone 5S and Galaxy S4 and arguably better given the lens and Nokia Smart Cam software.Call quality is fine, although not one of the phone's stronger suits.  The app store is still relatively limited as well but those minor things aside...can't recommend this phone enough for anyone on T-Mobile that wants a great mid to high end smart phone.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice phone, easy to use", "Author": "John W.", "ReviewID": "R1VPSPVOXS27ZW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is nice phone.

Gentry", "ReviewID": "RVT66BJ2DWJA5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Microsoft guarantees support for this phone through at least 2017.  That was the main reason for this purchase as I was more than a little tired of Android phones becoming obsolete after a few months.  Microsoft had 3 updates waiting for this phone and more on the way after I first turned if on.  Since Microsoft bought Nokia, you know they'll be trying to make a good impression with the Nokia products and attempting to get the most out of them.When I bought this for $269 it was a good deal as T-Mobile was charging $408 for the same phone and AT&T; was charging $399 for their 925.  If you are an AT&T; sub, you would still come out ahead getting this and paying the $40 or so to get it unlocked. It has all the frequencies AT&T; uses.  I subscribe to Simple Mobile and the phone works out of the box with a Simple Mobile SIM since they use T-Mobile's network.  Using Simple Mobile instead of T-Mobile saves $10 a month and would make your net cost for the price of the phone $30 after 2 years.The phone is new, runs without lag, and overall is a great phone with a great camera.  The 4 star rating is because of the lack of an SD card slot and the WP 8 operating system still having some quirks which hopefully will be fixed at the end of June when the official version of WP 8.1 is released.  The worst issue is when you first start your phone you will be disappointed with heat levels at the top of the back cover and horrible battery life.  The solution is to shut your phone off, turn it back on and set it to airplane mode for a few minutes, then go to normal mode and you will see improvements.  I did that twice and never had these issues again.  Battery life is also hindered by the built in \"battery saver\" app.  It seems to use more power checking to see if the battery is low than it saves when the battery is actually low.  These are operating system problems widely reported and not the fault of the phone.Despite the issues and the lack of an Opera browser or any browser that isn't just wrapped around IE, at this point I still favor this device over any Android phone.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "moatseast", "ReviewID": "R3D2TTX7B5E44W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I love this phone more than any other phone I have purchased.
