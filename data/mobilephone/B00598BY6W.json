One method I found it  best was to talk to the seller about the phone before buying it. Its better than asking questions under the question forum where one half of the people have had a bad product and the other half have had a good one. Its hard to determine whether you'll get a good product or a bad product by  somebody's own experience. I recommend talking to the seller, they were kind and were very accurate with their product. The seller I recommend is Put Group USA. They seem to be doing pretty good but I had to check for myself. People had been getting locked phones. Mines was unlocked, all i needed to do was insert my T-Mobile sim card. People claimed when updating to ios 7 the phone ran slow. My phone remained the same, it works perfectly. Its not slow at all. The problem is also don't always go with the used phones, because although they may claim they are in perfectly good condition when they tend to be messed with. Just go with Put Group USA, and talk to them first.

I called the seller prior to ordering and was actually able to speak to a real, live person who was able to answer my questions.UPDATE: About a month after receiving our phones, mine developed (or I first noticed) a microphone problem, apparently not uncommon for the iPhone 4. Following my failed attempt to diagnose/fix the problem via Internet tech forums, I contacted Paragon R3 for advice.  Their reply: \"We need to replace your phone.\"  They promptly provided a link to obtain authorization and a pre-paid FedEx label. Paragon did not quibble over the warranty and their personnel were consistently polite and helpful.  I now have my replacement phone and all is well.

I reviewed comments by other users regarding buying a phone from this seller. I was confused why a new phone would arrive that appeared to be used. So the phone arrived appeared to be factory sealed, but when I opened the box it did indeed have a screen protector on the front and back of the phone. I know from purchasing other iPhones that Apple has a throw away plastic cover that is usually on the outside the phone. This did make me wonder if it was indeed a new phone. I believe that it is a new phone, but measures were done to protect the phone. The seller states this phone is factory unlocked. So the question is did the factory put these screen protectors on while unlocking the phone.2) The phone is unlocked, but there are two models of iPhone 4 GSM & CDMA. You need to evaluate what provider you are using and if you will be using the phone in USA or aboard. I purchased this phone GSM format (comes with micro sim slot) to be used with Virgin Mobile, but as it turns out Virgin Mobile is not compatiable with unlocked phones. I was unaware of the fact that Virgin is locked and does not work with unlocked iPhones there are also issues using the VM phones outside US. The unlimited voice and data for $35 will be missed. No other provider offers unlimited for this price. I wanted an unlocked phone so I could switch providers and do it as a prepaid user. If I had to do it over, I think I would have gone directly to Virgin and purchased the Virgin locked phone. I would have saved $50 for the phone and then I would have a plan that provided great unlimited services. You might be asking why not just return the phone. For me I decided to go to T-Mobile and not buy a data plan. I pay $15 per month for unlimity text. This is a teen's phone so that works for me now. With the unlocked phone I am hoping for a future better plan as my teen gets older.3) The Amazon item showed the white and black phone. The default picture shown was white, but after I purchased the phone I realized it could be black or white. The lack of information about the GSM or selecting the color is problematic. It was a bit scary buying this phone, but if you are flexible then it can be worth it.Overall, my daughter loves the phone and it was really easy to move her number to the new iPhone to T-Mobile.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPhone purchase November, 2012", "Author": "Corliss Pearson", "ReviewID": "R1AXMCE4M6HHQI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this counterfeit iPhone in Novermber, 2012.

I appreciated that your description of the phone allowed me to understand what I was buying.  I'm a techno dummy so it is terrifying to fork out a couple of hundred dollars without really knowing what I'm doing.  Thank you so much for making this technology competitively priced!I bought this phone for my husband so that he could use it for straight talk. Even a t-dummy like me was able to make it work.This was my experience in June 2013.1. Faff around pulling your hair out because you don't understand what the hell to do.2. Watch about 450 instruction videos on youtube.3. Blunder around online trying to make sense of a million different instructions and finally call the straight talk help desk, which was actually helpful....This is what I really needed to do to make the iphone work:1. Purchase an unlocked AT&T; or T-Mobile Iphone.  Don't get Verizon or Sprint in this case. I used betterdealsfaster and a guy called Kyle Wunderli.  Check out my review on that service if you want to use him.2. Purchase a straight talk sim card.3. Purchase straight talk minutes or use your credit card to set up a monthly payment for the minutes.4.Purchase a micro sim card.5. Use the micro sim as a template to cut down the huge straight talk sim.  Make sure you cut AROUND the shiny metal surface! I guess you can buy a sim cutter online but I just used scissors.6. Go online OR call straight talk to activate the straight talk sim. This is also when you will transfer your number from your previous provider.7. Now you can follow the steps on any one of the MILLIONS of youtube videos which will tell you how to fix the APN settings on the iphone 4 for straight talk.8. Use and love your new iphone with all that juicy data-ry stuff and wonder why the hell AT&T; doesn't even try to compete with this new company.  At the risk of sounding amazingly paranoid, I feel like a consumer sheep being led to corporate slaughter.  We'll all know when the other shoe drops but until then, I love this cheaper phone system.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy", "Author": "Ali Jafargholi", "ReviewID": "RYP00KS5M79PR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with the phone and the service.I received the the phone in a great condition as it was promised.TOTALLY RECOMMEND", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy", "Author": "Ali Jafargholi", "ReviewID": "RYP00KS5M79PR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with the phone and the service.I received the the phone in a great condition as it was promised.TOTALLY RECOMMEND", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "Monica James", "ReviewID": "R350PIEQQX64E8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was a good product just what the company had described and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for am Iphone", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Nacho", "ReviewID": "R3GLCTDYHL0XPJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is fully unlocked and works perfectly outside the US.
