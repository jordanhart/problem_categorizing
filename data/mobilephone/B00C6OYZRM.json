{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Review from someone not new to smartphones", "Author": "Kyle \"cylem\"", "ReviewID": "R2TWKQJ7PK6D3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I try alot of smartphones, Galaxy S3, HTC OneX, LG Optimus G, Droid Razr HD and more. So i'm not new to smartphones so this isn't exactly aimed towards me. However I dropped my Razr Maxx HD and didn't want to break the bank replacing it so i decided to check out LG's new offering. I was looking for something that could keep up and something that would survive the day on a single charge.Design: The first thing I thought when holding this in my hands is \"Why don't they make more phones this size still?\" It feels great, has a nice texture and really lightweight. I held my Razr HD again and it immediately felt awkward in comparison. It's nice to see LG putting at least a little effort in the design of their budget phones. It's not the best looking or feeling but it doesn't look like an extremely phone either. I like their decision to add the 4 soft buttons on the bottom instead of the 3 which is the standard now. It also has a notification light at the top which is good, however it is only one color so you can't customize it for apps or anything.Performance: This phone like alot of reviews says comes with the same model processor as some of last years big phones like the Galaxy S3, Razr HD, Htc One x, Spectrum 2 the Snapdrago S4 MSM8960. However it's stated as 1.2ghz instead of 1.5ghz and is actually a \"Lite\" model which i'm guessing only means it's underclocked slightly. However I got an app that tells me the CPU speed and it told me this phone went up to 1.5ghz so who knows.However in the benchmark tests this phone actually beats out all of last years big phones. I would think it would be something to do with the higher resolution screens maybe, but even phones like the Razr M it usually beats, and the Galaxy Victory which uses the same processor it beats out by a bit.Now onto day to day use, this is FASTER than my Droid Razr HD, by a decent bit actually. I had a decent big of lag between launching apps and navigating around on that and with this phone it's all like butter. This is actually one of the fastest phones I've used, it compares close with the Optimus G and it's quad core + 2gb ram in every day speed. As far as gaming it handles the 3d games I've tried, it shouldn't have any trouble running anything out right now or in the future for a while.Software: One thing I really like about what LG has been doing is their built in software. They really took alot of the good things from the homescreen replacements and got rid of alot of the stuff people hate. You can customize the lockscreen alot, and a decent few homescreen things like the animations. It could be slightly more robust but it's great and not intrusive at all on the homescreen area. The notification bar is a slightly different story, it has a great quick settings bar on the top that I can customize with everything, gps toggle, wifi, bluetooth etc. I love that, but it also has a big wifi bar showing the current wifi connection, and a screen brightness bar, both of which you can't get rid of. Though they are useful, it takes up a decent amount of the bar and honestly I would rather have that space back.The other built in software is great, another awesome addition is the stock messaging app hasa  popup and quick reply to text messages. They keyboard is decent enough but I opted out for swiftkey. It has a decent amount of built in bloatware, but it hasn't been intrusive so far.Storage: Says 8gb but half is taken by the ROM so you only get 4gb usable, I hate this type of advertisement. However 4gb for apps is enough for most anyone including me, it has micro sd expansion as well.Camera: Camera is decent, it has a few focusing problems in lower light, now and then I just get a fairly unfocused photo. Although its one of the quickest cameras I've used also which is great for getting the shot you want.Screen: It's QHD 540x960 which on a 4.3inch screen is perfectly fine I can't make out any pixels when looking at it or anything and websites look great. Things might be slightly larger is your used to a 720p screen but really very noticeable. Also I'm happy to report the screen is perfectly usable in all condition. A lot of reviews stated that it was really hard to see in direct sunlight but i found this to be completely untrue. Even at around half brightness I can make things out in sunlight and with higher than that I can see it perfectly. One odd thing though is sometimes it limits your brightness to conserve heat which I've never seen before.Battery: Haven't tried it long enough yet, (will update the review) But it looks to be able to survive a day fine. I love that LG included a 2460 Mah battery in this, really there shouldn't be any way the battery won't be good. Currently I have had it on for a bit over an hour with a slight bit of playing with it and it's still at 100%, and last night I tested netflix for an hour and at the rate it was going I would manage around 8 hours of play. UPDATE: Well to give an idea of realworld use today so far my phone is on 4 1/2 hours of battery time on wifi, I have 32 minutes of screen on time, sent maybe 30 texts, played a game for 5 minutes, browsed a few websites and facebook, took a couple photos. So really with moderate use at this rate I could probably get 2 days. Granted also I have haptic feedback off,and auto brightness to save battery.Signal: Signal is great, just as good as my previous Razr HD, and call quality sounds fine too.One thing to consider before buying this, It doesn't come with NFC. Now this isn't a huge deal because Verizon blocked Google Wallet and their ISIS wallet app is available almost nowhere. But there are a few other uses for NFC and if you need it I guess this isn't the phone for you.Conclusion: This is probably one of my longer reviews, but I was so surprised and happy about this phone I just had to let everyone know. It's really speedy, feels awesome in the hands and has a great battery to support it. The only negatives are the Notification light, NFC , camera focus issues, and a couple software annoyances but these things are very minor and most people won't really see much issue. As things are if Verizon Asked if I wanted another Razr I would choose this over it.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG Lucid 2 Review", "Author": "Technology Review Guy", "ReviewID": "R311RHPX0EPOVB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this phone exactly a week ago, and it's amazing. First thing I had to do was update the software. It took me less than 10 minutes. The phone is very fast! It's the first phone that I've had that has 4G LTE. I downloaded the basic apps first (facebook, twitter, etc.), then fooled around with the phone. I noticed that the camera, a 5 megapixel camera, takes very sharp, and neat photos. I was impressed by the quality. The videos can be recorded in HD (720p) or Full HD (1080p), which makes an excellent addition to the cell phone. Now, I've been using the phone with different games, and the phone keeps up with them very well. There's no lag when I watch videos or play games. Everything on this phone is smooth. I also like the fact that this phone has gorilla glass, which is a good addition for anyone who may drop the phone. The phone itself is durable, but really thin in my opinion. That problem was solved because I purchased a case from Amazon. The case itself makes the phone feel and look more sturdy, thicker, and more comfortable in the hand. I do like the texture on the back of the phone. The phone also has two modes: starter mode, for anyone that's starting out on a smartphone or android in general, and the standard mode, which is for any experienced smartphone users. Since I've been used to Droid phones previously, I picked the standard mode. I recommend this phone to anyone really. Any person that's new to smartphones, android phones, or experience android users.

I've had this phone for about 2 months now and have had VERY few issues with it. My last phone was a Droid Bionic and it was feeling a little(lot) dated. Lets list the pros and cons, shall we?PROS: design is great, surprisingly good camera(can take full HD pictures(1080p), and even better video), love the very customizable menu(love monster land them!), can hide ANY app(so those preloaded ones you cant get rid of, HIDDEN!), fast, love the 4 soft buttons instead of 3(mostly the one to quickly view the \"paused\" applications and go to them or close them), feels great in hand, but with a case it wont feel so... breakable, like soo many modern phones, the pull down menu is very customizable with commonly used tools(bluetooth, gps, toggling screen rotation, power saving mode, etc. Also shows a conveniently sized wifi bar so i can see who im connected to at a glance, and a brightness bar so i can set the brightness), can see exact percentage of battery life remainingCONS: the battery life did seem to be fairly bad at first, but i also was in an area without a signal most of the time and didnt turn off cellular. But now im still in the same situation and it lasts about 4 hours longer(im in a \"dead zone\" for about 6 hours a day, and in a \"live zone\" for about 3. when i got out it was almost dead. Now its only about 35-45%, when it was about 8%).That's about it, and i would say the pros greatly outweigh the cons.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "lg lucid2", "Author": "mother of two toddlers!", "ReviewID": "R376F3K3P6YYCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone.

LCD clarity is good on both but L2 is much faster in response time, maybe with 4G LTE technology which i4, don't have.I like the i4 OS better than Android jellybean.  JB halts apps often where as I don't remember that with i4.  JB is more complicated to use due to 'too many' functions and options built in where as i4 os is much simple and easy to use, yet gets the job done.Corp email I thought was much easier to use and nav in i4 than JB which is very important to me when I check my company emails after working hours on my device.all in all, I thought i4 edges out in overall performance being a solid device with stable OS in place and ease of use.  L2 is a good phone and you may like all the options Android phones bring but may find the plastic  housing and light weight, cheap quality.also note that L2 cases and other accessories are not readily available and choices right now are very limited.  something to consider if you're the accessories person.  but i'm sure down the line, there will be plenty to choose from.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Mini Martha Stewart", "ReviewID": "R1ES968B5P1NWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone.

I've owned several phones smart and not so smart. This phone has a nice size and has an SD slot for adding memory. Thats pretty much what I like about it. The Camera is mediocre (not that I use it much anyway)the phone itself is pretty glitchy. I'm on my second phone as my USB jack went bad on my first and have all the same issues with the new phone. Touch screen is glitchy, sound quality is average to poor and it just doesn't operate smoothly. Phone freezes up regularly and just does weird stuff. I reset the phone daily to get that level of quality. If I get lazy and don't reset the power for a few days real weird stuff starts to happen.It is possible that I got two duds with the exact same problem, but what are the odds.
