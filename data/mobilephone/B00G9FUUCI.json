It is fast and has a strong, long lasting battery.  The Google speech control works extremely well. I commute over 50 miles each day and having a hands free device that is reliable is important. With this phone, I can send messages hands free by simply saying \"OK Google, send text to \"Dave\" (or whoever). Then I say what I want to say and then say \"send\". It works just as easy finding music, taking notes and adding to my calendar (including reminders). I love it and the price was right. Making and sending calls is easy as well. My vehicle has hands free calling and this synched with my car easily so I never have to pick up my phone once I get into my car. It automatically syncs with my car.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "sarah", "ReviewID": "R1YS5EHC2O05WH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love the beats audio, the touch less ability that it has rocks too!

She dropped it the first day from 4 feet on to club carpet and the screen shattered. my phone is an older Motorola Max HD and its supposedly the same materials but its a lot more durable, so I assumed the mini would be just as durable, but it is not.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Baldwins", "ReviewID": "R3VQZ0DCX6HNBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing --- it is fast in speed and speaking to type is dead on and accurate!

They sometime hear me clearer on speaker but that's not always an option depending on where I am.The sound volume is much lower that my old HTC Incredible even if on speaker.I like some of the camera functions however it takes poor pictures where the lighting is low, where my incredible took much better pics even w/ the flash.I need to check to makes sure the phone is not just defective tho.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00G9FUUCI"}}
