Get this phone and you won't regret it. I already get a lot of people asking me what phone is it and when I said it a docomo(Japanese Phone). People was popping their eye as they never seen a japanese phone working in Singapore. As this phone is running on GSM, it was able to use in virtually every country.That the cool part of people asking, but then there a few technical problem which you need to resolve if you really want to get this phone.1) It running on Jellybean 4.1.2. There is currently virtually no way to update the firmware unless you put back a japanese sim card and update OTA in japan.2) Unable to root. I try a lot of way but seem like it dame hard to root the phone...3) Phone reboot when accessing GPS. I spend a few day to resolve this problem until someone in forum highlighted that it need a 128K sim card, square not round type in the center, to resolve this issue.4) Battery was draining too fast... Nvidia chipset(what you expect?), Anyway, this aspect also taken care of as there a app in the phone call nx eco to address this issue. Be sure to on it. If not it won't last you more then 4 hours on road...5) LTE depend on network... It not supported in my country...6) Display seem bad however once you turn on the Graphic Engine it blow my S4 to dust....7) Camera wise... I think my S4 blow this camera to hell...Other then that ...

I spend a lot of time trying to find out how to solve it, finally I switched to 3G (I was using it on EDGE, in order to make battery last more), which solved the problem with restarting, but made battery life too short (about 6 hours...)* on 3G the battery life is unacceptably short, besides, the charging process is too slow...* Another issue: overheating... when playing a game (candy crush, in my case), after a short while a message appears, saying the the phone is overheated... after that, the phone slows down, deems the screen until the temperature decreases... Pretty upsetting detail* Camera: good under ideal light conditions, completely useless under low light... Flash is unable to sync with camera, so the shots in low light are almost always completely black...* Impossible to root, impossible to update, unless you are in Japan. Impossible to uninstall proprietary Docomo apps...Well, this phone is a complete waste of money and time.Just a good sample that \"made in Japan\" not always mean good quality.I have replaced this phone by Galaxy Nexus 5...", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "fujitsu arrow f-02e", "Author": "sevdalin iliev", "ReviewID": "R3LTV87ZEXRDBE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "fujitsu arrows f-02 x white docomo unloked  great phone high quality made in Japan great display highly recommend reliable thank you", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C15N310"}}
