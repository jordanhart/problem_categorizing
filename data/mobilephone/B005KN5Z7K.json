{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Last of the Real Palm Breed", "Author": "Clint W", "ReviewID": "R1H72W1VU4OMQG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Centro purchase was actually my second.  It replaced my first one after the on/off button finally disintegrated.  I have been using a version of the Palm since the 90's.  For me, it is the perfect Personal Information Manager (PIM) with calendar, address book, memo book and task manager.  The OS is totally rock solid.  The combination of a Palm device that includes a cell phone is all I need and want.  I do not have a carrier data plan and pay only for cell minutes, then plus any text and data minutes I choose to use.  Sadly, this is the last of the old (pre-Web OS) instruments.  Even the current Apple Mac OS won't sink with it now.  Technology has moved on to what is considered better at the expense of reliability and ease of use.  If you're still using the older (better) Palm OS and want the convenience of all that information in the same package with a phone, then this is your instrument.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buy 2!", "Author": "Jeffrey D.

The Palm Desktop software (not included but found on the HP website using a Google search) easily collected all of the contacts, call logs, calendar events and software from my old Treo 650 and transferred them to my new Centro. It's like having a new and improved Treo in a slightly smaller box. Activation with Verizon was also easy. Pressing *228 for activation, I entered the phone number of the old Treo, an account password, and within a few minutes, had my old friend in a shiny, new package. Like the Treo, this is one of the last smartphones that doesn't require Verizon's expensive data plan. I should have bought two!", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Long live the Palm Centro", "Author": "Gink the WonderBunny", "ReviewID": "R3FPYN7RZB6YNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes, awesome phone.  I purchased two (through Verizon, not Amazon) when they had a two-for-one special several years ago.  It was my daughter's first phone--she refers to it as a dinosaur, so I got her an iPhone and am keeping her Centro around as a backup in case mine ever fails.  Love, the Palm OS, the battery life, the PIM app I use on it (Info Select, sadly no longer supported), and will find it nearly impossible to replace if/when it ever dies.  Long live the Palm Centro!

The Palm Centro fills the bill.  I was able to get it on Sprint with no data plan, but took some arguing with the phone rep, but they finally relented.  For phone/texting/pda and PC sync, this cant be beat.

The buttons are a bit small on the keyboard, but with teenager's nimble fingers, it shouldn't be a problem.I went round and round with 2 Verizon reps trying to get the two I purchased activated without a data plan - both reps were very insistent that the phones had to have it. The trick is for them to disable all data on the number/account *first*, then add the phone, and then it won't require the data plan to activate. You may be able to disable the data on your existing number on the site then go through the online activation process, but I did it by phone. Doing it this way on the 2nd call also allowed my Treo 700p to be activated, when the previous rep couldn't get it activated without it requiring the data.Can't speak much to the camera or other functions, as we have not used them yet, but I did want to note the way we were able to get them activated in case it helps someone.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "First Palm Phone", "Author": "Dragonfly", "ReviewID": "R27K3IZILN2KRE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered 2 of these phones to replace two broken phones.

She was delighted and going to change her plans. LOL! It is truly one of the last phones you can do this with.As for the phone itself, we are happy with them. Battery life holds up great!!!!

Its web browser (Blazer) is far extinct, but usable on *most* textual sites, including CNN, and others. It won't play videos anymore as it once did because the technology has far outpaced it. I write this in 2012. The Palm 690 Centro's debut was five years ago and even then its aging Palm OS/Treo system was getting a little long in the tooth for casual phone users. BUT for power PIM users who want a tether to their PC desktop, I don't see a reasonable alternative. Droid and iPad/iPhone do not cater to business users and most manufacturers have discarded the notion that buyers want a tether to a PC (or deliberately prevent it to sell other technology). I give this phone 5 stars-- even though I am theoretically trading down from a Droid Pro and before that a Galaxy S II. I also gave away my iPad to my wife as I am not a web browser.
