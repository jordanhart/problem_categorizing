Well worth it. So many more features, volume buttons, silence camera shutter, better camera and video quality, bigger screen, solid durable device (better compared to first Sparq) and a gripped back cover allowing the phone to rest on your lap or phone without a case, (Old Sparq is like holding a bar of irish spring soap) Wayy better, has the options to buy games too. Browsing is way faster too, slide out keyboard keys are plastic and not that rubbery crap! Although they are really sensitive compared to the old Sparq, nothing i cant get used to though.

While it may have some neat features such as a flashlight, a camera, speed dial, and the ability to access the web, this phone shines in its simplicity and lack of time-consuming apps. Before this phone, I had an HTC HD7. Spent a good deal of time on it during the day, and eventually realized that phones with apps and games and internet access really take away from enjoying the simple pleasures of this life. This phone prevents that. I went to a restaurant once with some friends and one of them pointed out a certain family in a booth. All of them staring intently at their phones. All of them letting their food get cold. Don't let the world consume you! Although this might be just one small step in the direction to changing the world once more into a place where people can actually experience the nature of life and the life of nature, it's still a step in the right direction and at the very least I'm changing my own life.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good sound; features not so good", "Author": "J. Hodgdon", "ReviewID": "R36M19R6SZSP15", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My flip phone ended up elsewhere and I needed a new phone fast for my prepaid T-Mobile plan, so I went out and got a Sparq II. The reasons I thought I wanted to upgrade from a very basic flip phone to the slightly-less-basic Sparq II were: QWERTY keyboard and music player.The good: It works fine for making calls -- the sound quality is better than my older flip phone, according to people at the other end. Like the flip phone I had before, it uses a micro USB for charging (so it's easy to get a car charger etc.), and supports Bluetooth.The not so good:a) QWERTY Keyboard: The keys are so small it's hard to hit the right one. I suppose I could get used to it in time, but it seems doubtful I would, given the small amount of texting I do. So, that feature is practically useless. Text entry on the numeric keyboard with word suggestions is faster and easier than the QWERTY keyboard for me.b) Music player: I primarily want to listen to podcasts of radio shows. These last about an hour typically, but I rarely can listen to the whole thing at one time. The music player is practically useless for this because (a) it doesn't remember where I was in the podcast -- when I exit and come back, I have to start at the beginning and (b) the fast forward button is more of a \"slow forward\", so even if I knew where I was in the podcast, I would have to hold down the fast forward button for ages just to start listening. I think it would take me several minutes to get to the half-way point, and if my finger slipped so I changed to the next podcast, or I got a call or something, I'd have to start over at the beginning. Ugh.c) Another annoying feature: the phone beeps when charging is finished, and there is not any obvious way to turn the beep off except maybe going to a completely silent mode (and I'm not even sure that would work, as I haven't tested it yet). I generally charge my phone at night, and I don't want it to beep when it's done and wake me up, but I also don't necessarily want to turn it to completely silent mode every night either... I might not remember to do that every night when I charge up, or might not remember to turn it back to normal when I get up. Ugh.So... On balance, I don't think the Sparq II is worth the upgrade from a cheaper flip phone, for me at least. I'll probably end up returning it and getting something different.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "pocket dial monster", "Author": "cody", "ReviewID": "R26U2ZDVD6JKVZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This piece of garbage pocket dials more people than i call.

Saldivar", "ReviewID": "R2YAN0I8M2CPUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have XL-sized hands so I have always struggled with phone keypads and keyboards. I stopped using touchscreen phones because it was such a frustration to type on a virtual keyboard. For that reason, I've tried many phones with physical QWERTY keyboards over the years and the Sparq II is my second-favorite ever (my fave was a now-discontinued Nokia model, also for T-Mobile).The phone feels very solid - the slide mechanism does not wiggle and it seems to stay shut when I want it to with no problem. The numeric keypad is a bit cramped if you're used to a flip phone or a candybar phone with a smaller screen (and hence more room for the keypad) but even with my huge fingers I can work it well enough. The slide out QWERTY keyboard is very nice. It's sensitive enough that I don't feel as if I have to pound the keys but not as sensitive as a virtual keyboard - I seldom mistype letters as long as I hold the phone still and at a certain angle. I've had it three days and I've already gotten used to the keyboard.The interface is good. This is NOT a smartphone so don't expect the ability to add apps or hyper-customize the interface but the onboard functions are fine. The call quality and volume are very good, reception has been as good or better as other phones I've used in my same location, and the features and functions I've used (calls, texts, alarm, contacts) all work as they should. I haven't used the Web browser extensively but it seems fine for a non-smartphone. The screen has excellent resolution but it is small compared to a touchscreen-only phone (that doesn't matter to me).If you want a physical QWERTY keyboard and don't need to load your own apps, this phone is a great option.

It's like it reset itself, and whenever it comes back on, it takes forever to find service. We've never had this problem in any phone and I'm starting to reconsider my purchase after 48 hours! She's big on texting, so this is a very big issue for her! I do not recommend this phone if you're into texting!UPDATE: I contacted the company that manufactures the phone, ALCATEL, and they told me that the only way that the phone's issues could be resolved, is if I went to this website (alcatel.finetw.com) and fill out a form to get the process started. That might sound nice, but apparently the website doesn't exist! I contacted this company after I found that out, and they told me that there was nothing that they could do, because I couldn't fill the form out. How am I supposed to fill the form out, if it doesn't exist? Also, they continually ask if you'd like to do a factory reset on the phone. I purchased the phone, and within 48 hours, it started blacking out during texting.... A factory reset will not resolve this issue! Do not buy from this company, unless you're willing to be ran through circles!!!!!

I buy 1,000 minutes which are good for a year.  At the end of the year, barring anything unusual, I usually have 600-700 minutes left. So one cannot argue that I simply wear the phone out or beat it to death.I bought this phone to replace a lost LG, which I loved but is no longer available. Because I'm such a light user, the folks at the T-Mobile store suggested that, instead of buying a phone of the same price class as my LG, I simply go pick an inexpensive phone at a local Target or Best Buy. So off I went to Best Buy and ended up with this dreadful device.The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the packaging is that the charger is the cheapest piece of plastic crap I've ever seen. The cord is flimsy. That should have been a clue, but all I need is a phone that works when I need it to so I stuck with it.  I half expect the charger to one day burst into flames while I'm charging the phone.What don't I like? Where to start? I won't discuss some of the issues others have mentioned because there are only four things I really need in a cell phone.  Good reception. Better than good voice quality. A phone that is well-made so I can expect it to last more than a year or two. And a battery that has good standby and talk time.So where does the Sparq II fit? The reception is mediocre at best.  Voice clarity is so/so. This is not an inexpensive/budget phone. It is a cheap phone. But where it absolutely fails in battery life.  For example, I fully charged the phone on Tuesday. On Wednesday I called home. The call was about three minutes maximum. This AM when I checked the battery, it was down to about a quarter of a charge.  This is a persistent issue. I have not yet had this hold a charge for a full week, even if I haven't used it at all.What do I like about it?
