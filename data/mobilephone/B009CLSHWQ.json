This cell phone is very bad quality, almost useless.1) Sound - very low and bad quality. Without hands free you never hear voice. With hands free if you maximize volume, sound goes jerky and hoarse. Forget about using outdoor.2) Cover on speaker got unstuck very soon.3) Sound via headsets is very low, forget about using them for elder people.4) BT chipset is very low quality, BT connection is very bad even in 1 meter distance and sound is jerky.5) Batteries seems cheap due to low quality appearance.6) Touchscreen is resistive and therefore it's too difficult to work with it.7) User Manual is almost useless due to bad translation;", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009CLSHWQ"}}
