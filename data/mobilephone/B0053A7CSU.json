{"Reviews": [{"Title": "advanced in some respects, very limited in other", "Author": "Aliaksei Sosin \"rookie\"", "ReviewID": "R3GBKDDWHW87X9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This watchphone is ok. Despite its frustrating broken-english user guide, the menus are good, and there's many languages to choose from. Bluetooth headset is a must for this phone. The phone is very comfortable for people on-the-go, like drivers, bikers,... shoppers... :)It has some very advanced (but not very useful with such a small screen) features like video player and even e-book reader. The watch is capable of being a webcam too.On the other hand, it lacks some crucial ones: you cannot assign a photo to a contact, there's no stopwatch, calculator is hard to access, no Outlook contacts sync, etc.Going into details, after you buy this watch, you may want to do a youtube search \"adjust bracelet metal wrist watch band\" - I had to remove 3 links to fit my wrist.The watch is based on MTK6225 chipset. That gives us another useful knowledge, the software called \"Fly PC Sync\" or \"Fly phone suite\" - search it on the web. While intended for another phone models (sharing the same chipset), it adds the ability to sync to Outlook. Nice!All in all, great phone if not some firmware oddities.p.s. Forgot to mention, the USB connector is proprietary... which is a pity. I think standard package should have included at least 2 cables for that reason.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1.5 inch full touch screen stainless steel waterproof watch mobile phone W818\nstainless steel waterproof watc\nwatch mobile phone\nW818", "Name": "Stainless Steel Waterproof watch mobile phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61AbcaKn75L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0053A7CSU"}}
