I went with the C5302 specifically to use with T-mobile's HSPA because I live in the sticks I know LTE won't be an option for a while. It took less than five minutes to get the phone set up after I activated the new SIM card whether it was g-mail, SEN, or Evernote, everything synced up without any problems.My iPod is what I use for my music, but the Walkman on the phone is very good, I would say my music sounds better through the phone than though the iPod.The viewing angles may not be ideal, but I haven't had any issues with the display, pictures and movies look beautiful on it. The sound won't blow you out of the water, but it's more than adequate if there isn't much ambient noise around you.The only negative aspect about the phone is the camera, and to be honest I have yet to see a phone that takes anything but \"okay\" pictures anyway, so I don't hold that against Sony. It does have manual settings which will give you much better pictures if you take/have the time to set them up properly.I don't play many games with my phone, but I do like the fact that its Playstation certified. Being able to use a PS3 controller along with an MHL cable makes playing more enjoyable.So far battery life is just as good as any other smart phone I've used, between two and three days depending on what I'm doing with it, and it only takes about three hours to fully charge from a complete drain which is nice. I don't load to many app's on my phones, but I don't really have a problem with the 5 gb's that are free, that gives me enough room for a couple movies internally and still enough room for a few more app's. I do keep all my pictures on the SD card though.Overall I like it just as much as any iPhone or Samsung phone I've had and better than many of the other phones I've used.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone", "Author": "Meesam Abbas", "ReviewID": "R1SBMLCY1QWL5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent phone for the price! It does and contains everything a mid range smartphone should do and have in today's market. I was skeptical about it at first since it did not have any reviews, however, I decided to go for it, and I can't be happier. The LEDs at the bottom add to the overall design of the phone and are a base for many compliments. The phone feels heavier than an iPhone 5, because it is bigger and all, but I prefer that heaviness so it wasn't an issue for me. One recommendation is to buy an external SD card as the 8gig internal will definitely not be enough, seeing as how you only have 5.5gig available,", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "The definition of a good mid-range phone", "Author": "Joel E", "ReviewID": "RBIE5U1LOACMZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "DISCLAIMER: I haven't written any reviews on Amazon before, so I apologise if this reads horribly. I really felt like this product deserved a proper review which would cover all the points I certainly wanted covered when I was looking to upgrade to an everyday-use smart phone.Introduction:So I set about looking to upgrade my phone in about October 2013, my previous model was one Blackberry Curve 9300. It definitely had served me well as a phone, but it's poor processor speed just couldn't cut it these days when it comes to trying to have the internet at your fingertips! If you're anything like me, your main reasons for choosing a mid-range phone should be something like:1. Your old phone can't use the internet / uses the internet very slowly.2. You want a new phone that can still make texts/calls/the basics very efficiently (as often people grow to their old phones and can text off them in a jiffy)3. You want a newer phone that can run multiple applications at once without slowing down - and also maintains good battery life.4. You want a phone with a decent camera which you can pull out on the fly and take good looking photographs with (maybe even wanting a phone that can take good selfies with the popularity of Snapchat at the moment)5. You also want a phone with good video recording and playback functions, having a crisp screen to enjoy images/videos on.6. The phone is generally easy to use, can be learned quickly and feels responsive.7. Finally, you want all of the above without having to pay a hefty price tag of \u00a3600+ for some Apple equivalents at the moment! AKA , the phone is good value.Well, I'm happy to talk you through all the good and bad points this phone has to offer, and why, 3 months on, I'm feeling happy with my purchase - which I think ultimately should be the bottom line.1. Internet Browsing - 5/5The Xperia SP's browsing capabilities are very strong. It has immediate access to Google Chrome browser, which I'm using right now to write this review. It's very easy to open new tabs and even has a widget readily available to Google search things straight from your home screen. I find this to be one of the best features about this phone, I find myself easily taking it out and can whip out a Google search or a Facebook stalk on the fly no problem. The processor speed of the Xperia is excellent for its price bracket, it can handle multiple tabs + videos with ease, and loads pages very quickly. The larger than average screen and responsive touch controls actually really suit the phone for internet use, and on using other smaller/thinner smartphones, I think this works to its advantage.2. Text/Calling functions and other basic elements - 3/5For me, this is probably where I think the Xperia falls down the hardest; simple texts and calls often get ignored and understated in phone reviews these days - I certainly hadn't heard much about it before I purchased the phone. However, before you read the reasons why I think this, understand that coming from using a QWERTY keyboard Blackberry for nearly 3 years has meant I generally have always disliked touch screen phones!Even when ,under settings, you turn off the 'Vibration on touch' feature, sending texts/Whatsapp messages results in the phone constantly vibrating under your fingertips, and a sort of feeling like its always 'catching up' to your speed of texting. I had no issues texting on a Blackberry phone before this, and could send long texts in very quick time with little to no typos - WITHOUT an auto-correct. With the Xperia SP however, I feel that almost every other word will have a typo in it, despite me trying very hard to press the small keys accurately. At first I thought it would just take some getting used to, but 3 months down the line, I still dislike texting and tend to avoid it to the same level my all-thumbs parents will.On using an iPhone 5/5s of one of my friends, it didn't feel as clunky as the texting system on the (notably larger) Xperia - further leading me to believe this might not just be a personal problem.When it comes to calls and contacts, the Xperia has a very attractive and easy to navigate Contacts book, which even can connect to Facebook and filter out contacts without mobile numbers on their accounts , instantly filling up some contacts. The speed dial feature is somewhat pointless, as it takes you multiple touchs to get to the numberpad, and it is often faster to just call a 'favourited' contact in the Favourites tab. All in all, it works as I would expect, and the microphone and speaker of the phone feel like a good volume for calls without having to throw it on speaker.The phones in-built e-mail system works very well. It looks clean and neat, and it had no issues connecting to my e-mail account. It also had several features for how often it checks for incoming e-mails/ to do it manually. This can be important if you have a very limited Data plan. The phone can open many different attachment formats for quick viewing without having to run to a computer.3. Strong processor ; strong battery life 5/5 ; 3/5The processor for the Xperia SP is , as stated, very very good for its price tag. I use my phone very often. I forget to close off applications (which can be easily done by swiping them off). And I often have a lot of stuff going on at once. Not once however, have I noticed any sort of lag or slowing down of the phone due to this. I imagine for the vast majority of customers, the phones speed at which it handles what you throw at it will more than impress them. The battery life for this phone was initially one of the selling points for me, as in many reviews they praised its inbuilt Stamina mode and high-powered battery. In practise, the STAMINA mode DOES help to conserve a little extra power , as it turns off mobile data when you lock your phone. It isn't though, as miraculous as you would expect. With normal usage and 3G always switched on, I find myself charging the Xperia at least every evening. Compared to other smartphone battery lives, I would say the Xperia is very average.4. Camera features - 3.5 / 5The Xperia SP comes with a single flash, 8 Megapixel rear-facing camera, and a somewhat sub-standard VGA camera facing the front. I find the focusing system and lighting when using the phones camera to be somewhat unremarkable (despite what the trailers may tell you). The phone definitely needs good lighting available to be able to take good pictures, and I definitely don't think it functions brilliantly in doors. If you have everything set up well however, the camera does take very crisp looking pictures/albeit the lack of optical zoom means they a very range limited. The colours do appear SOMEWHAT washed out, and if possible, I like to have a camera with me as well. It does more than good enough a job however for emergencies , and for taking quick snaps of people.The front-facing camera is somewhat of an Achille's heel for the Xperia, the VGA camera provided really does a poor job at taking selfies. Snapchat is not going to be your ally with this phone. If you have good lighting again, and can hold the phone VERY still (it can't focus) then a reasonable shot may be achieved - with the likeness to your webcam back in 2008...5. Video recording/playback - 4/5The video features of the phone are fairly average just like the camera, the microphone picks up sound to an ok degree as one would expect, and the videos can sometimes suffer from loss of focus issues. All round though, they work in the same situations you would want the camera for.The phone plays HD videos on its 720p screen VERY well however, and the colours look very nice and bold. I have no issues watching videos on my phone like I would my laptop.6. Ease of use - 4/5To me, this is one of the most important categories. I'm happy to say that I think the Xperia does an all-round great job at feeling very slick in how it works. The app store is VERY ease to quickly log on to and start downloading the wide range of Android apps in a jiffy. The multiple home screen system works very well for organising different spaces and apps on your phone. You can customise and move things around your home screens very easily by just holding your finger over things. The toolbox feature allows you to quickly turn off the backlight, mobile data, Wi-Fi, roaming and a whole range of other features with just the tap of a button - instead of having to trawl through Setting like I am used to. The phone has access to swipe unlock, pattern unlock as well as number code unlock, so is very versatile. I really like the LED light strip on the bottom of the phone, some may find it a little tacky or annoying, but I love it. In any case, its fully customisable to be different colours for a range of different alerts - from calls, to texts to charging/fully charged. If you really don't like it, it can be permanently switched off.To be honest, I could talk for hours on how I like features x,y and z - but I think you could figure it all out yourself without any difficulty! Please, if you have any specific questions about something that you might find to be insignificant to most, but important to you, please ask below and I'd be happy to answer.7. VALUE!I managed to pick up my Xperia SP in an October sale for only \u00a3199.99!(~$325). Comparing this phone to the other leading smartphones on the market these days, and let me tell you I definitely did my market research for good value, I find this price to be MORE than good value to warrant what the Xperia offers. Yes, you could spend \u00a3500, 600 + on an iPhone 5sxps, or whatever make is the newest out now, but I honestly struggle to see what you're getting extra for over 3 times the money. You might just be paying an extra \u00a3400 for a fingerprint scanner...I would love to compare the differences of this phone to its other key midrange competitors, such as the Samsung Galaxy s4 mini, but I think this review has been long enough - and it is meant to focus on the Xperia!If you have any questions regarding the differences in more detail, and why I chose this phone, please comment below!Conclusion:The Sony Xperia SP is a sleek, attractive, great value and very easy-to-use midrange smart phone. It is underrated on the market and often it over-shadowed by Sony's flagship Xperia Z as well as the more popular Samsung, but there's no question that the SP can more than hold its own in this very competitive market.If you want a new phone to put you up-to-date with seemingly everyone and their Aunt having a smartphone, and for a great price, the Xperia SP should be for you!Thanks for reading.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great upside mid-level phone", "Author": "Roberto R.", "ReviewID": "R2ZDV7TWLBUWBF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Writting this review with it:Pros.1.

It has a lot of features and sleek presentation. Sony does love their bloatware, however, so spend some time cleaning it up because it's small processor does tend to bogged down fairly easily. Also, Camera has a very slow start up. These are not super concerning or even bothersome issues, but there is one that is both. The internal speaker has some bug that shuts it down from time to time. This means, during phone calls, that people can hear you but you can't hear them. This causes me to sound either like I have hearing problems or like I'm a huge jackass to my all my friends. This also means you can't play music through the phone's speaker. I believe it has something to do with how the phone reads whether or not there are headphones in, but I'm not a phone software doctor scientist.

I installed a 32GB card and proceeded to download several maps for offline GPS navigation but soon I run out of storage. To make the long story short you cannot store applications in the SD card, the maps were stored in the internal memory and soon I run out of it. You can only store or transfer photos, videos and music files and your Windows PC will recognize it as 'Xperia SP' storage but you cannot store data files for your games and other application in the SD card to be used by the phone. For more information search 'can't move apps sd card android' and  'Memory in Android devices'. I travel a lot and wanted to have offline GPS maps for the entire world like I used to have in Nokia phones. It was also entertaining to have the entire globe in a tinny memory card, to me it was better than a game. I gave this product one star because I cannot use it to store applications in the SD card. I have not used it as a phone yet.4/13/14 Revision.Above was \"operator error\", I hope others do not make the same mistake. Instead of deleting this review I decided to leave it in place in case someone else experiences the same thing (makes the same mistake). I decided to re-install the apps and noticed that I was asked where to install the apps in the \"Internal Memory\" or the \"External Memory\". The SD is considered external memory so I am currently re-installing in the external memory (SD). I will change my rating to 5-stars unless if something goes wrong.4/14/2014 Revision.I re-installed the applications but there was no change. It still installs in the internal storage (5gb) and NOT in the external 32 GB SD card. Unfortunately my initial assessment  was correct. I change my review back to one star.
