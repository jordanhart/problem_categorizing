{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I like it but it may not be suitable for everyone", "Author": "drebbles", "ReviewID": "R23T8MOSBKNJEY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For use only with Virgin Mobile's Beyond Talk Plan (meaning you pay a set monthly fee rather than topping up every three months), the Venture is an android phone.  It uses the Nationwide Sprint 3G Network.  It has several apps including Google Maps, GMail, other e-mail, Navigation, Google search, YouTube, News, Weather, and more.  It has a QWERTY keyboard as well as an on-screen keyboard.  When you buy the Venture it comes with the Venture mobile phone, micro USB cable, battery cover, 2 GB micro SD card (mounted in the device), battery, USB power adapter, and Basics Guide.I had problems when I first got this phone and wasn't sure if I would like it.  I charged it per the instructions but I couldn't activate the phone and had to call Virgin Mobile who were very helpful.  Once I got the phone activated I turned it off overnight only to find out it wouldn't turn on the next day.  I recharged the battery and it worked fine until I shut it off overnight - again it wouldn't turn on in the morning.  Finally I removed the battery, reinserted it, recharged it, and leave it on all the time.  Now the phone works fine although the battery does wear down fairly quickly (the box says the battery stays charged for up to four hours talk time and up to 300 hours standby time - I think those figures are overly optimistic).Now that the battery issue is solved, I really like my Venture phone.  For me it is a good introduction to an android phone.  I can do a lot of things with it - search the Internet, check my e-mail, take pictures and movies, shop, check Facebook, use a GPS, and more.  I can leave verbal messages for myself, write memos to myself, set different ring tones for different people.  I like Office Suite - I can read Microsoft office file formats and view PDF files on my phone!  While I downloaded and read the User's Manual I didn't really need it - using the phone really is intuitive.  I've had no problems receiving or making phone calls - the sound is clear and I've had no dropped calls.The Venture may not be for everyone - the short battery life may not be suitable for people who make frequent phone calls or texts.  But for someone like me who uses my cell phone infrequently and wants a low monthly payment, no contract phone plan, the Venture is perfect.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Bad I really love it", "Author": "kaycblu", "ReviewID": "R3JAVI66Z7Y3JL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I NEVER write reviews but I feel that this phone is a bit better than everyone is saying so I will try and tell you guys everything I know/like/don't like about this phone. Ok to start I had an Optimus V and I HATED it kept doing crazy things and the keyboard situation aggravated me every time I used it. So I saw this cute little keyboard phone decided to give it a try and I could bring it back if I didn't like it. Now I was going to get the Optimus V slider but it was a bit expensive for me. So I will admit that the keyboard is a bit cramped even though I like the size I do push multiple buttons a lot but it doesn't bother me as much as the V did because it ALWAYS got the word wrong and this I just push the backspace key and type what I wanted to say. Also a con I found is that I can't see my email it says here is your email but a blank screen comes up which is a bit wierd but oh well i can use a computer for that I guess. But to be honest it looks just like the Optimus V, button and menu wise, must be the android so I really didn't notice a difference. I did notice some obvious PROS which are more memory ( hated the V for that), slightly faster when it comes to downloading stuff and of course the keyboard! I hate to say it but maybe just get it and try it out first because that is the only way to know if YOU like it because I did see 2 reviews about the phone before i bought it ( only 2 because it was brand new) and they both said it sucked but I was like well it is cute, $99, and has a keyboard lets try it lol. So that is really the only thing I can say is try it but I Love it so far and won't go back to the V anytime soon.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "AWSOME", "Author": "DomoLucas", "ReviewID": "R2QTZUKKJOVXU8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone so much.

I really only needed a phone for the sole purpose of being a phone. Previously, I had one of those super cheap pay-as-you-go tracfones that cost about $10 and was happy with that until I accidentally put it in the washer. Obviously, I needed a replacement. I saw this and promptly picked up the Virgin Mobile brochure prior to purchasing and read about the pay-as-you-go plans. I figured, what the hell, $35 a month nets me 300 min of talk time and unlimited web, data, and texting so I'll give it a go. The worst case scenario is that I end up with a $50 paper weight and I've bought more expensive useless things in the past. Well, it works. What more could I ask for? Break time at work is suddenly more entertaining and I can surf the net whenever. So, the kicker question is, how does it function as a phone? Well, it does that well too.

Now for the Good,bad,and the UGLY part. Purchased:08-22-2012Good- I was very pleased upon opening this product. I have been a Virgin mobile and Tracfone,user for several years now.And this phone by far was one of my best purchases;that is until yesterday.Well that;s the UGLY part(let me stay on track)I've wanted to buy this phone for a while now.So when I walked in on the perfect day and it was on sale, this was too good to let go. I love the fact that the phone has a qwerty keyboard as well as a touch screen.Since the voice commands works great on this phone,I only need to use my fingers to text when it malfunctions or cannot recognized the words that are coming out of my mouth.Then screen quality or resolution is great it is better that I expected. Very clear. I watch videos on you tube and most of the time I am like \"wow\" this is a very good resolution on this phone. The phone has 3g service for the most part and does not drop(until you read bad.Great design, very attractive phone. When I first logged into my e-mail account,and facebook account, to my amazement all of my contacts and calendars synced to the phone upon me simply logging in once. I have never seen that on any of my phones(I normally have to do it manually_)It was nice!!!! Blue tooth works great except for one glitch(in bad section). Music or speaker on the phone has good quality.I downloaded a few apps and as we all know from other reviews, the memory is not good,but what it good is that you can move the app you download to the memory card if you like to free up memory;Overall, this is a great phone for the price or a starter android phone. It is very easy to navigate and has plenty of awesome pre=installed apps.Oh, and plenty of free apps from Google play...YEAH..oh another awesome thing is the keyboard lights up so you will know what is going on in the dark.lol..pic quality to me is pretty good and the flash actually works in the dark.Wifi work as it should.If I missed anything sorry.Bad- If you have small fingers this it the phone for you.If you have average or big fingers, you will want to throw the phone after trying to hit any \"LETTER\" for more than 2 or 3 minutes. Let me clarify. The qwerty key board is great as i state above, but it is small. The letter on the \"on screen key board\" are bigger. Definitely for bigger fingers.But, the keyboard is off sometimes 1-2 letters off. Im pressing the \"r\" now but it keep putting an \"e\" on the screen its annoying, but manageable once you a get use to it.As long as the voice command and \"speech to text\" work, you will be ok.Speaking of, the voice command and speech to test malfunctions frequently on the phone I have. It was good for a week then down hill from there.But, the feature works great when it actually works.Next up, for some odd reason my bluetooth stay connected to 2 items at the same time which scares me half to death sometime.When I hear a strange noise coming from my laptop that is in the living room and i am in the bedroom (audio feature active on both computers at the same time but audio is random on one on the computes). Then there is the Virgin Mobile voice that comes on when the phone is turned off then on that scares me no matter what. But the odd thing is that if I set an alarm for work and have the volume to the MAX, I can barely hear it going off next to me. But I can clearly hear the Virgin Mobile sign on=off even if my in the next room. Go figure.Anyway,I haven't been able to connect to the \"Virgin mobile\" live music at all it always says \"Buffering\". So, I log into pandora and it says, You guessed it \"Buffering\" like it is now. No streaming music. But you can watch video if that helps.So, UNLIMITED DATA...HUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!! Also,My data on my phone keeps turning it self off. Granted, I do have a battery saver app that i use that was preloaded on the phone to help assist with battery life on the Venture.Even if I have the app turned off, my data still is being shut off without me doing it. Mystery???? The battery is the next topic bc my phone as of date cannot hold a charge for more that an hour to and hour=half. It suppose to have a talking time for up to 4 at least.  after charging, my pone goes from 99% to like 40 or 27 in less than 10 minutes.Another mystery???Could be the apps running in the back ground...who knows?So, back to the topic BAD< summary, if you have huge finger you will get frustrated unless you are a calm person overall.Secondly, the voice command and speak to text may malfunction.Third,streaming music does not STREAM.Oh and the TOUCH SCREEN MALFUNCTIONS AS WELL AT TIME, FREEZES.And another thing the phone gets very, very, HOT at times.This is during regular or simple use.And data turns off on its own.Finally for the ULGY: I woke up yesterday feeling lovely.It was raining but I didnt care b/c I woke up feeling good. And then, wait for it.....I turn on my Virgin mobile phone...Then screen was blank-completely Black. I was like wth is going on. So,I pressed the button again because for some reason I thought maybe I did not press it hard enough, So again screen blank. So I take the battery out then put it back and No \"VIRGIN MOBILE \" scaring me as usually. There were words on the screen about the ISO software crashing on the phone.And it told me to restore my phone. Luckily it was only a month old and there was not a lot of room on the phone for me to save important documents or pics downloads.Call Virgin Mobile..On hold forever so I had to go to work,, Called next day on hold still...Finally someone..restored my phone and now there is a permanent black space on the phone. It looks like widesceen movie view *android gingerbread software 2.3.Anyway,after the screen loaded it was like it was \"posessed\". The phone started calling and texting people on my contact list at random with random stuff.IT was craZy..If you think that is bad, the phone was also going on the internet while I was driving and then started calling people. Camera started taking picture an videos as well. The screen frozed but the phone was still accessing info.But, it could have been a hacker or something..Because I see the thing that were happening on my phone when someone access a phone remotely.Fufthermore, I followed directions on the phone and it seem to be ok except for the space. Contacts and other info downloaded again on first login as stated above.Overall, I like the phone but it has a lot of issue. But we all know that there is always one bad apple in the bunch. I think i got it.Im going to see if I can get this one replaced since it is still under warranty or I will have to get another one if his happen continuously.I love the phone and hope it start working better.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really disappointing!", "Author": "Patricia King", "ReviewID": "RDC31WY9TXOLA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really want to give this phone a good rating because I'm happy with the look and feel of the phone, and of course Virgin Mobile has the cheapest monthly plans around.  I wanted something with a similar look and feel to a Blackberry without having to pay the much higher Blackberry price.  However, this phone has next to no battery life...if I use any of the apps, especially the navigation app, it drains the battery down in a matter of minutes.  I also have to be careful when recharging because if I keep it plugged in too long, the phone starts acting real quirky and won't power-up beyond the logo screen.  It also gets real hot when charging, and sometimes when using certain apps, like the navigation app.  When it gets hot like that, it's likely to shut itself off and then when you power back on again, you can't get past the logo screen.  It is possible to reset the phone once it cools down and you allow the battery to discharge all the way and then recharge it again, but resetting the phone means losing everything you have installed that is not on a memory card, and then having to reinstall everything.I know the problem is not just with my particular phone because I've exchanged it twice under the terms of my warranty, for a total of three different Ventures that all have the same problem.  I'm going to switch to another phone because as much as I like the look of this phone, all of the problems I've just listed make the PCD Venture just not worth it.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Short battery life and locks up", "Author": "E.

The phone is well constructed and appears durable. That is the good...now for the bad and it is bad. Phone locks up about once a day and none of the buttons work. That includes the off button. The only solution is to pop off the battery cover and remove the battery for a few seconds. Then you must do a cold restart. Very irritating.  The physical keyboard is a little too small to avoid hitting at least two keys at once. Slows down the texting then to a crawl. This phone goes through a battery charge very fast. Way too fast. I doubt the amp rating of the battery. While it discharges fast it also charges too fast for the output stated for the charger.

Biggerstaff \"stuart_b\"", "ReviewID": "R1IPRI29SF65M0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got one of these for three reasons:  I wanted to try a phone with Android and a keyboard.  I wanted to try Sprint/Virgin Mobile again because they said their coverage was improved.  And I found one of these at Amazon for $15.00 plus shipping--under @5.00 in all.I found the combination of the keyboard and touchscreen very usable.  This keyboard is one of the better ones on such a phone.  Unfortunately, that still leaves the keyboard inferior to my old Nokia E5, or all the non-smartphones that have QWERTY keyboards.  Still it offers faster typing than virtual keyboards on anything smaller than a 3.5\" screenUnfortunately, I still found that where I work is in a near deadzone for Sprint.  I considered looking into getting this flashed to Cricket, but since they had a similar phone with a slightly bigger screen, and managed to get it for about $50.00, I didn't.  I replaced that phone with a more typical Android phone because the keyboard, though faster in ideal conditions was unusable it the light wasn't perfect.  I might have held off longer on changing if I had worked with this one.The keyboard has drawn a lot of criticism, but it is a very good size for both one and two-finger use, while slide-out ones are generally too wide for one-finger.  But the wedge-shaped keys designed for thumb use are actually problematic if you do the one-finger typing that phones often call for, or use fingernails as likely with large fingers.  The numbers are near-illegible, but the arrangement is standard, and when you are dialing you use the onscreen keypad anyway.The other criticism has been battery life, and it is shockingly short compared to my old Nokia or the non-smartphones I have had.  But compared to two subsequent Android phones I've used, and comparing notes with friends who have a nice Samsung phone and an iPhone, this isn't that bad--the worst, but not by much.  I suspect a cheap phone like this draws people moving from old school smartphones and non-smartphones, used to going days between charging, while people using expensive smartphones for a while have developed strategies for keeping them charged.Mine has some problems with the headphone jack.  It works with headphones, but not with most external speakers I've tried.  That is probably why I was able to get the used one so cheap, but it might indicate something likely to break on a new one or perfect used one.And I find that it has very little internal storage.  That isn't really a serious constraint on adding apps, because a lot will fit on even a 2GB micro SD card and the phone will take up to 32GB.  But a lot of the factory installed apps will not move off internal storage.  I find I can't upgrade one because the new version is about twice the size of the original.A really good-looking phone, and inexpensive, if you can live with its limitations.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this awesome little phone!", "Author": "Bonnie Barbara Burke", "ReviewID": "RAL7AVY84DQZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for almost two weeks now and I must say that this phone is really cool.

This phone has an excellent layout, basically a Blackberry Curve/Bold appearance with both options of a keyboard and a touch screen. When I had my Curve 8530 before this I was thinking that I might have to do the android switch because the phone was becoming so outdated and I didn't want to leave Virgin Mobile. This was basically the closest to the Blackberry because I wanted to transition without losing my physical keyboard. The physical keyboard on this phone is not as horrible as everyone says...if you had a Blackberry prior to considering this phone you will be fine its very similar, just a different layout for the keys. The phone itself has a decent display, streaming Youtube videos is quite clear and I really never had an issue with clarity. However the phone is slow, like really slow. The processor isn't good and streaming can be quite difficult, I literally have to kill every task on the phone if I'm going to watch a video just so it doesn't skip. And for you thinking that reason for this might be the Wifi signal being too weak, however this is not the case...the phone is literally inches from my Netgear N600 router most of the day. In terms of battery life, I feel that this is literally the deal breaker for me to have this phone as my main one. The battery is HORRIBLE. If you want to think that cell phones and laptop computers are similar in the sense that you charge them then can take them on the go...this would be the desktop computer of phones. It always has to be plugged in or near a charger...I've gone from 52% to 14% in minutes at one point and I just don't get how erratic it is. If you want an entry level smartphone however and you constantly go from charger at home to car charger to charger to charger to charger then you will be fine with this phone. For the price, its a steal. Although I have mixed reviews, I would recommend it as an entry level android.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Internet Radio", "Author": "ReaderX", "ReviewID": "R2NC37WEP3R5OO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this on sale to play with it as an internet radio.

This is my 4th Virgin Mobile phone -- I have purchased 3 this year for various reasons and at great sale prices and my original Nokia Shorty is still working great!I purchased this phone because I am selling an app for Android to business owners. It is the only reason I got it as I was very happy with my LG Rogue that I bought in the beginning of the year. So it is my first Android phone.First, the overall look and feel of this phone is classy. It is slim and not too big, and it is a two tone of platinum and brown. The keys light up in the dark and are shaded with a brown tone as well. The keyboard keys are small and also sculpted I think to make it easy to maneuver around them. I too had a hard time initially texting and using the touchscreen. The touch is very sensitive. I was not sure I would like it as the operating system is Android and took some getting used to as well. In my first few phone calls the screen went dark and I was unable to hang up. I actually had to ask the other person to hang up. Later I realized it is related to the display setting for screen timeout. I had it set to 2 minutes and that was the reason the screen went dark.I think a lot of the complaints are related to the operating system -- which is Android. It is more sophisticated than regular feature phones and lets you do more but you also are required to know more. It also tends to drain batteries more and that is a problem with EVERY android phone even the expensive ones. What you need to do is remove apps that you aren't using and turn off data. There are free apps to help you do that.For the battery issue: what you should do if you are not using your data is TURN IT OFF which is easy to do from the settings screen. When I turn my battery off it will last about 2 days. Realize that with every Android phone you will have the issue as basically the operating system is too \"BIG\" for the hardware at this point until the next genius figures out how to make the hardware fit the software.Gradually I began to like the phone more and more.. for it's elegance.. the one touch command to bring up the search for example M will bring up all items related to M automatically. It is very easy to search the phone or internet -- the advantage of an android over a hierarchical phone where you have to navigate menus. I like the fast scrolling opitons and the fact that you have have 5 different home screens or ids as they are called. Someone said you cannot remove the Virgin Mobile downloads.. not true.. you can easily remove any app by going to settings/applications/manage apps. You need to spend some time with the user manual and the phone to really know the true capabilities.The phone can be customized in a million ways. I also love the live window wallpapers that are animated. I bought Snowfall Live which shows a snowy mountain and changes the scene based on the time of day. There are a million android apps to use on the phone.The sound quality of the speakers is excellent. They even had a preset \"classic\" bell phone ring which I love!SO, this phone is NOT for someone who is going to be doing alot of video and music streaming.. you will go through the battery very quickly. This is a phone for someone who wants a classier phone that can do more but is not wanting to deal with more expensive/sophisticated hardware. It grew on me slowly and now I love it. IF you love to tinker around and explore, if you want a nice looking phone that doesn't cost big bucks, if you'd like to explore the planet Android, this is a good first step.And like another reviewer said -- review the phone you have not the one you want.I think it is a class deal at a great price and I'm glad i got it!", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "allysa", "ReviewID": "R4DMQ0CQMIOW1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "christmas present. cant beat this for the price! i cant wait to give it to my husband for Christmas! he will love it", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "just whats needed", "Author": "william V. wambolt Jr.", "ReviewID": "R2PWTLZ2V3YADC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this phone performs well for a basic user such as myself.it could use a higher capacity battery.as mentioned would recommend for basic users", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "No battery life", "Author": "Jacquelyn Karlic", "ReviewID": "R2EBM2OJQQ5CTQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I needed a phone fast but couldn't spend a lot of money at the time, so I bought this with the intention of getting a nicer phone a few months later.

This wouldn't be such a huge problem if the phones internal memory was already so low that the installation of these apps causes a \"low memory\" error on the phone, and won't let you install anything else, or even move the apps to the SD card.Additionally, the keys are so poorly made that pushing one button activates a button one or two buttons over, and they are tiny enough with an awkward slant to them that makes typing extremely uncomfortable. It took me 3 full minutes to type out \"LOL\" in a text because of the horrible keyboard.Bought mine from Radio Shack, returned after less than a day because it's complete junk.

These devices can be found for under $100 in some places and it will save you a lot of grief down the road.

I was attracted to its cute small keyboard and a screen size i was willing to settle for the price of it. I knew the talk time was only 4 hours and it was slow. While waiting for the phone in the mail, I researched many online reviews. every professional had a negative review. I told myself, of course this phone looks bad if your comparing it too samsung galaxies and iphones from the future!well, my dislike for it was very quick and simple. the screen is too pixelated for me. its like seeing everything in blocks. i thought with such a small screen, they would compensate with a decent resolution! well..... no! its too pixelated for any app to be seen properly. while waiting for this phone I began debating this impulse buy against the Virgin Mobile Rise, which i also have a review on! coming out of the box, the pixel and low low! resolution was an instant deal breaker. I must see my web and youtube videos clearly and this phone fails. now I must go through the tedious task of returning it to the website. regardless of your phone needs, simple or tech-savvy, do not by this phone. its a kids phone. in the year 2012, an adult with a professional job and urban life such as myself can not settle for a low grade phone such as this. nor should anyone else.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "instagram", "Author": "gabberz", "ReviewID": "R1OG27RKT2SKDN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "hi i ordered this phone last week but hasnt had the time to swap my intercept to this phone yet. i was wondering if your able to download instagram for this phone. on my intercept i couldnt since i figured it was a 2.2 android and gave me tons of problems im hoping the venture is a bit better.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!!!", "Author": "Peter A.

I have it setup to use PayPal to pay the monthly bill so now I have a great phone and no contract! The bill is the bill and included in the flat rate is the price you picked. I guess Virgin takes all the hidden fees out to do that, but who cares? When I got my old phone bill with Sprint it used to just tick me off to have all the government add on fees in addition to the price for the plan, and Sprint had that habit posting one price for the phone and then you learn that at the cash register that $50 of it is a mail in rebate (which I hate).I used to be with Sprint but when my 2 year contract expired. I had an HTC Touch Pro 2 and I did like that phone because the touchscreen was way too sensitive and when you were talking on it your ear would open who knows how many windows.

I bought this phone from Virgin Mobile for $99. A week later the price went down online as well as in retail stores to $79. This is a poor excuse for an entry level, low budget, eco-friendly smartphone. The battery will last you about 2.5 hours and that's on stand-by. Not even texting, calling or checking the time and with wi-fi turned off. I have to lower my screen brightness to the lowest just to squeeze 3 hours of regular usage out of a full charge. The keyboard is cramped. Even for small hands this would be painful to use. Literal pain. These keys are so flimsy you have to press down hard on the plastic keys. This phone freezes a lot. I have 9 essential applications I absolutely need and that are not moveable to the SD card. 9 apps and the phone's memory is already full. This phone damaged my 16GB Micro SDHC card and I had to format it. I lost most of my pictures and videos. The only thing this thing has been able to do well is run the Easy Tether app. I get good speeds from Sprint where I live. I am only gonna say this once. DON'T BUY THIS.
