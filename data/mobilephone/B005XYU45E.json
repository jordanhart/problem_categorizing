{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perhaps the Best Android Phone Ever", "Author": "SCJaredJ", "ReviewID": "R1UZ96FN9H8NPR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let's be honest here, if you're in the US looking at the Samsung GT-i9250 Samsung Galaxy Nexus GSM Unlocked phone, you're not the average cell phone buyer. You're looking for the latest (at the time of release) Pure Google Experience phone, and you're not waiting around for AT&T; or T-Mobile to bring this little beauty stateside.  You're a premium cell phone connoisseur who wants perhaps the best Android phone ever, and wants it now!First off, this is the GSM Unlocked version of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  You Verizon and Sprint users are going to want to move along, as purchasing this phone will only lead you to utter frustration.  This phone's unlocked pentaband radio means that you'll have little trouble setting this up on US T-Mobile or AT&T; 2g or 3g. Let's also not forget that the phone supports 21 Mbps HSPA+ speeds, meaning you won't have 4G LTE speeds, but you'll get great speeds on T-Mobile or AT&T;'s networks (note that actual coverage and speeds will vary based on location).So now that you've figured out that you need this phone and that it will work on your network, how is the phone?Two words: \"Simply Amazing.\"I've used many Android phones, and I can honestly say that this phone is perhaps the BEST ANDROID PHONE EVER RELEASED.  As a Pure Google Experience phone, you'll receive Android updates essentially straight from Google.  This means you aren't saddled by any unwanted bloatware that cell phone companies or carriers add to their phones, or unwanted UI skins such as Blur or Sense.  Also, it means you won't have to wait for updates.This is the first phone to feature Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS).  I won't bore you with the intricacies of ICS, but I'll let you know that the phone operates extremely smooth.  Powered by ICS and a 1.2GHZ dual core processor, the phone glides through home screens, menus and applications without a hint of lag.This phone forgoes most physical buttons for on-screen buttons, save for a volume rocker and power/unlock button. This may seem weird at first, but the spacious 4.65\" HD (yes, HD!!) screen allows for easy navigation.Speaking of the screen, it looks amazing. I've had no issue viewing outside in direct sunlight like I've had with other phones.  I will warn that if you have smaller fingers, the 4.65\" screen might be difficult to manage if you're trying to hold and use the phone one-handed.  But, the added screen space also makes it extremely easy to type in portrait mode, as the screen size provides a portrait keyboard almost the same size as a blackberry.This phone comes with 16GB of internal memory, which is a lot of space, but honestly it would have been nice if they included a micro sd expansion slot for more space.The 5MP camera is pretty good.  It's not a world beater that will replace your point and shoot, but it will get the job done.  What it lacks in picture quality is made up for in software enhancements including almost zero lag shutter capture and the addition of a stock panoramic mode.  Videos can be recorded up to 1080p@30fps using the rear camera, and 720p@30fps using the 1.3MP front-facing camera.  There is also a LED flash on the back. The phone also contains video and picture editing apps from Google so you can quickly and easily edit your pictures/videos.The standard battery for this phone is 1850mAh, which will easily last me through a work day without any tweaks.  You might not get as much mileage out of this as I do, but at least the battery is replaceable and larger batteries are available.My main disappointment with the phone deals with a lack of a dedicated HDMI out port.  Sure, you can use HDMI out, but it requires a separate adapter, and I'm more in favor of phones having a full HDMI or micro HDMI out port instead of using adapters.  Also, note that since this is a Google Experience phone, there is no native DLNA apps installed, but you can find many adequate apps in the market (many for free as well!)Like I said earlier, since you're looking at this phone, you probably already know that you want it, but you're probably trying to figure out if it's worth the hype.  All I can say is that it is TOTALLY WORTH THE HYPE.  I've used this phone for over a week now and absolutely love it.  The only regret I have is that I wish I would have purchased it earlier.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Near to Perfect Smart Phone, overall better than any nearest Rival", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RP9PRQIYD232E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have just completed one month of owning of Samsung Galaxy Nexus and I have no doubt declaring I am very happy with this. This is the best smart phone on the market for the time being until iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy S3 releases. I had iPhone 4 for 2 months and I like many other people who could not be satisfied with beauty and fruit brand alone threw that 'dumb beauty' . For me that was more of a 'show off' rather than of practical use.Apple itself in a recent patent suit directed against google termed this as the \"most creditable competitor to iPhone'. Apple co founder which is not a apple employee anymore and hence free to speak truth freely declared iPhone easy to use but 'Android more feature rich'. He dismissed Siri totally saying he could not understand how come internet could be needed to make a call through Siri. Do I need to say more now? If yes then here is the detail review:Like ->(1) Bigger HD contour display-> Though you can distinguish between pixels while looking closely unlike iPhone's Retina display, Nexus's display is gorgeous. Colors are very vibrant and rich. Black is real black (because of Super AMOLED display technology) which creates the whole difference.The Screen is large and with medium hands I can reach to the whole screen stretching the thumb or fingers. Sometimes I tend to use the other hand (luckily I have two hands and both are fully functional so can't complaint).Because of bigger screen this phone is more useful or convenient for what Apple invented iPhone for ie Browsing web, playing games, watching videos. And because of this I tend to depend lesser on PC/laptop/tablet. With bigger screen, power and customization of Android OS this phone is closer to our old friend PC/laptop.**I run the same HD video both on nexus and iPhone 4S and nexus one was better to watch.**(2) Soul-> The soul of this device is ICS OS which is now equal to iOS in terms of user friendlessness but is better because it is much more customizable and hence you feel completely in control and power. This is different feeling than using dumb iOS. After using ICS I really struggled to use the iOS or same iOS based apps. ICS is lightning fast and smooth.Face unlock, NFC, android beam and google wallet (not available on Verizon version) are very cool. Face unlock works perfectly.Built-in Data usage monitor is very helpful for not letting you go above your data limit.-> Mine is international unlocked version which within a week got automatically updated to 4.0.2 from 4.0.1.This has Best notification, better customization for web browsing.Ohhhhhhhh... did I tell you android has taken two steps which is miles ahead of time and going to change the things completely? (i) No Physical button-> The buttons are in fact part of OS itself and function well. Hence the buttons can now be context specific and smarter. They change their position depending on how you are holding the phone or what you are doing. While watching video they disappear completely giving you the whole screen for watching, and yes they will reappear on appropriate place when you need them. (ii) Same OS for all devices: Unlike Apple now same application can run on any device running on ICS. For apple the applications need to be written separately both for iPhone and iPad. That's why Apple has lesser applications on iPads. With new approach of ICS now people will just write once and run it anywhere hence number of apps is going to get multiplied faster on ICS.(3) Eco System (Apps)-> Android eco system (or app market) is there on par with Apple eco system. In the same period I have installed more applications than I did on iPhone 4 (because most applications are free compared to Apple). I am more functional on Android than I was on iPhone 4. There is nothing which I want and its not there. And yes now google going to start monitoring of applications so less argument against Android apps.(4) Form factor-> I like its form factor more than of iPhone's. Countered makes it more convenient to use and keep in the pocket. Now to me iPhone is just any another device and I look on iPhone with pity.(5) Battery-> I need to charge it once a day with low to moderate usage which is what other iPhone 4S customers are also doing. And if you are going to use it like laptop you will need to charge it more (is not this same with your laptop?). Better part is unlike iPhone you can carry batteries and change it easily. No complaint here.(6) Reception-> Decent.(7) Call quality-> Nice.(8) Volume/Speaker-> Low, could be helped with volume control plus application.(9) More social-> Very well integrated with google.(10). Build-> Except the battery cover everything else is of high quality. I don't care about plastic versus metal debate. iPhone even with metal and corning glass are equivalently fragile and people have been reporting iPhone being broken having dropped just from 12 feet or so. And with gorilla glass on both ends iPhone 4 is more fragile. Remember gorilla glass is just scratch resistant not damage resistant.(11) Typing-> is a breeze and it seems to read you mind and hence make typing a different experience than on iPhone. And big screen helps every here again.Unfortunately this phone decided to do have some deliberate suicidal traits perhaps to avoid wiping away other Samsung devices. So here are the things which could have been improved upon:(1) Speaker-> Could have been better (Minor+ issue)(2) Reception-> Though not much complaint, Could have been just a 'little' better (Very Minor issue).(3) Camera-> Could have been better definitely.(4) External Storage-> Either they should have allowed adding external storage or given the device with more alternated with respect to storage capacities. (Minor issue)(5) Display-> Should not be able to distinguish pixels (Minor issue but this should be ultimate goal for the display)Conclusion-> This is the best smart phone on the market for the time being if you can live with some minor issue with volume. And all issues reported so far with this device seem to be software issues and should get corrected with updates or third part applications.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Get it on the play store, its cheaper", "Author": "Anony", "ReviewID": "R1WQ42MWB9QEY3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "too expensive here for something that doesn't offer official Google Support. Without flashing the phone, there's no way you'll be able to upgrade to Jelly Bean. The product is fantastic, but the price is not. Even with tax and shipping, its still cheaper on the playstore. I saved 20 bucks and have official google support (and warranty!)", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Best Phone if you want pure google OS", "Author": "RatuKamina", "ReviewID": "R4BMEXDAFP7ZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about three weeks. I got it new from ebay and the box had the samsung UK seal on it. As soon as I placed my T-Mobile sim card from my former Galaxy SII SGH-T989 and turned this phone on, the signal was on E then within seconds it went to 3G then to H. It prompted me for update of OS of around 8.7MB. I checked the OS version afterwards and it was 4.0.2 and the app that checks for YAKJU build confirmed this was pure google OS and that it will get latest updates directly from google. After a week went by the phone was working flawlessly no random reboot no freezes just smooth ICS but I wanted 4.0.4 update since I heard how much it improves the OS. After trying the manual update mode several times I decided to boot it using power and both volume up/down button to check the specs. Mines didn't have PRIMELA03 bootloader and other stuff written there didn't match phones that had been flashed with google OS from googles developer website. So after trying several times I finally got the universal drivers to install on my windows 7 pc and proceeded to flash the latest ICS version 4.0.4. I did everything as instructed on the web but now I was unsure if my phone would be able to download future updates and install them without issues. So I flashed my phone again but with version 4.0.4 build #: IMM76D which from what I heard had radio/signal issues and google had to push out build number IMM76I to fix it. After I flashed and relocked the bootloader the phone turned on and prompted for a very small OS update and downloaded and installed without any issues. As far as I can tell this phone is awesome if you can tweak it once to get the actual google ICS image directly from google. Mines has been working for over a week now on the latest update and it has been flawless smooth and fluid ICS OS no freezes like my galaxy SII which still uses gigngerbread 2.3.6 and the added touchwiz which I hated. Bottom line if you have been thinking of getting onto the android bandwagon then this is the particular wagon you need to jump on. I have had iPhone since 2007 up until iPhone 4 and got tired of Apples restrictions.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good phone for the price", "Author": "TNHN \"book worm\"", "ReviewID": "RC1Z2J6VIAJ8C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first considered a Samsung S3 or S4 but could not afford it, then I saw this Samsung GT- i9250 Galaxy Nexus from Google. It's smaller than the S3 and S4 and has no external SD slot, only 16 GB of internal storage. But that's all I need. I received it with Android 4.1 loaded. After starting to use the phone, it was upgraded to 4.2, then the next day to 4.3! Thank you Google! The display is gorgeous. Battery is decent with whole day of average use without recharging. I inserted the T-Mobile SIM card and it was connected right away. Connecting to the network was also a breeze. For me, the 4.65\" screen is perfect.

So just went for it and bought this phone. I could not be happier. The phone just feels EXTREMELY fast, especially with the Android 4.1 (JellyBean) update. The only thing I was worried about was the camera, but that's not really an issue after all, as it takes great photos, especially with some apps from the Play Store. The screen is gorgeous, and so is the phone. I love the clean front that is free of logos, and the textured back feels and looks great. The phone is covered with plastic, but the plastic is covering a steel chassis, so the phone feels much sturdier in the hand than most plastic-clad Samsung phones. It does not feel or look cheap at all, looks more premium than the Galaxy SII, Samsung Infuse, or even the Galaxy SIII, to me anyway.I highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a Pure Google experience on a beautiful phone!", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excelente Celular con la vision de Google", "Author": "Jose desde Venezuela", "ReviewID": "R18T2A1HW7DR1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Compre el celular desde Venezuela, Excelente Equipo, Se actualizo a Android 4.1.1 ultima version, cuando otros equipos apenas se pueden actualizar a 4.0 en venezuela, un equipo bastante ligero y amplia pantalla, rapido, excelentes aplicaciones totalmente integrada tales como twitter, facebook, Waze, whats apps, Juegos como Angry Bird Star Wars gratuito y lo mejor la integracion con Gmail, los contactos de gmail desde PC, se actualizan inmediatamente con el celular, el uso de gmail, es como si estuviese trabajando en PC y sumamente rapido.Seguire probando las aplicaciones disponibles.El unico detalle que le veo, es que el volumen de aviso de notificaciones como mensajes es sumamente baja, seguire investigando sobre este tema, puede ser configuracion o buscar sonidos fuertes para instalar.Recomendado, en resumen, la experiencia de usuario es muy buena con este equipo.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice and solid device", "Author": "Kobe", "ReviewID": "RH8TPEUJ7AAX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like my Galaxy Nexus.Please note there are 2 main sub-models, one is supported by Google and the other one by Samsung.

The reasons I don't give it a 5-star rating:- Sound volume seems low compared to other devices. Hard to hear some phone calls when in noisy environments- Although the idea to support MTP for connecting to PC is right, lack of support on linux makes it inconvenient. It requires extra effort to use MTP, otherwise, PTP works out of the box but is somewhat limited.- There's no external memory--well, can't have it all- Camera quality good but not great", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazed", "Author": "Jean M.

I still have to get used to the size; This phone would be perfect if it were a bit smaller, for some people, like me, it is a bit difficult to hold or use it with one hand. My thumb just can't reach the upper corners (where Android decided to install most of the time the settings or options button for the apps) They say it has a big screen but at the end one part of such screen is just used to show buttons and is never used to give more room for videos or such, so it end's up having the same actual screen size than most other phones.I had a bit of trouble with my order: It says here that the model is i9250 but instead I received a SC-04D which turns out is the same model but in the Japanese version for company Docomo. As such it also starts up with Japanese as default language. This caused me two things: first I got really scared that this phone would not work in my carrier's network and second it took me a bit to finally be able to change the language to english! After some forum browsing turns out this model is the same as I9250 and one should not be scared about the different model thing but a Note explaining all this from the seller would have been the courteous thing to do to avoid the scare.They were polite and helpful in the customer service email I got after initially filing an angry claim against them in Amazon thinking I had been ripped off.Oh, one last thing: I had trouble getting the 3G started both in ICS 4.0.2 and later when I upgraded to 4.0.4 I thought it would be the Baseband or the phone even but turns out it was just Android acting up and after turning on and off the 3G setting it finally got it.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Best Android ever", "Author": "Rishi", "ReviewID": "R1G7NF1KJMUU8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I moved from iPhone 4 to this one because of google services which are offered on the Google phone.

I had my doubts at the beginning, mainly because of the huge screen and the lack of SD card. Besides, coming from and HTC Desire, I have to say that vanila android was not my favorite flavor of the OS. Those fears has vanish, the screen is gorgeous, and ICS is really a huge step forward for the android platformThinks I like:*ICS is very fast and fluid. This particular item has change a lot since gingerbread. In ICS, hardware acceleration is fully enabled. Scrolling through lists is fast, no more glitches. Apps like Facebook or Twitter are way better to use.*I installed Google chrome beta, which is by far the best browser I seen in android (is not installed by default though) pinch and zoom is fast and smooth*ICS new look, apps and widgets in the same tray. The whole new system design is more intuitive (at least for me, maybe for ppl coming for other platforms disagree)*Dedicated button to see running apps is really really helpfulWhat I don't like:*I had read a lot of complains form other users about the volume being too low. I agree that is not the loudest phone Ive used and that the maximum volume levels are indeed too low. But I haven't missed a singe phone call or text message since I have it. Some users have reported that this could improve using the Volume+ app on the Google play store, but I don't feel it to be necessary (at least for me)*The reason why I rated the phone 4 out of 5 was mainly because the phone I received was not the US variant. The first thing I noticed when I received the hone, was that the whole box and all the labels on it where in Japanese. After I opened the box I found that the little instructions brochure were also in Japanese. I turned on the phone, and once again, Japanese as the default language (this can be changed of course to English). Digging on Google I found that the phone I received was the Asia & Pacific variant, which is NOT supported directly by Google. This was really disappointing. The good news are, that this actually can be fixed. As a rom flasher veteran on android, all I had to do was to download the official firmware image from: [...], and flash it on the phone.

It plays graphic intense games with no hiccups (e.g. riptides, Nova3, etc) and photo editing (which is something I do on a daily basis for instagram) is wicked fast.Battery life is not bad...I can use it moderately and it will last me for about 14 hours without a charge (this is a 3G version which uses less power than LTE)...unless I use it to watch movies which may last about 5 hours.Actually I am a bit surprised that this phone didn't get much recognition or media attention.

Because the low ringer volume precluded using this product for receiving phone calls in most mobile situations, I gave this product only a 1-star rating.In the meantime I have discovered a makeshift remedy that might work for people who are not choosy about their type of ringtone. It turns out that with Pyxis ringtone (and maybe with some others as well) the ringer can be better heard in mobile situations. That's good enough for me.Another irritating flaw is a too-low sensitivity of the WiFi receiver: In my 2-floor appartment I can only receive the WiFi signal when on the transmitter's floor and ridiculously close to it. To be sure, nothing is wrong with the signal -- it is robust enough to be received by my laptop, indicating a 5-bar signal strength, all over the appartment.To sum up (with Android 4.1.1 \"Jelly Bean\"):Flaw 1: low ringer volume that can only be useful with few select ringtones.Flaw 2: Insufficient WiFi receiver sensitivity.Because I can now use my phone to receive calls in mobile situations I have raised the product's rating to 3-stars.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Charger works for US outlet ??", "Author": "Raju Naidu \"rbn\"", "ReviewID": "RLF5HR067NXX6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally placed order for the awesome phone.Can any one clarify that the charger comes with compatible with US outlet ??Thanks", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Open box! yakjujp? dont know if i trust it", "Author": "CharlesBabbage", "ReviewID": "R2L3EDV6H5AZME", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The box was open but some clear tape was put over the sticker.
