{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent  Cellphone.(Update 19/06/2013)", "Author": "ectoBiologist \"badassDeterminator\"", "ReviewID": "R1ATZEJFP38S8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first time Buying a cellphone on amazon. Because of that, i spent a lot of time doing research about this model BEFORE buying.First impressions of the phone made me very happy. Its very thin and sleek. Has a very good grip but just in case, buy a TPU cover for it.The screen is amazing! It has Properties pertaining High-end Cellphones like gorilla glass and such. Sturdy and scratch resistant, It makes it a very good screen.Opening the Back case is a little messy hehe but nothing to worry about. Inside the battery case you will see that this phone supports micro SD cards, up to 32 GB if my memory serves me well.Another thing you will see is that it Uses a standard sized SIM CARD, so no worries there unless you have a micro SIM CARD. In the same area you will notice that this phone LACKS NFC CAPABILITIES . Although this was one of the reasons i bought it, it is still a superb phone so no problems there. The reason for the lack of NFC is that this phone is an asian version, thus the model number 705. The P700 however , has NFC capabilities .It has a 5 megapixels Camera on the back too. My test Photos are very good. Of course Remember that this is NOT  a camera, it is a phone.This phone has a CPU processor of 1GHZ and aside of that, a GPU of 200 MHz so its not dual core but it plays games , videos and music  with a very good performance. It also has 2.72 GB of internal storage. It says 4 in the description but it doesn't account for the OS so , that's it. Ram is 512 MB which is also very good and decent for a phone.Ok going For the front side of the phone you will see a notification led, and a light sensor . These two work as intended. At their side you will see a 1.2 megapixels camera, Ideal for Skype and Video Calls because it wont need to transmit a lot of high resolution video data.You will see 3 buttons. The psychical one its the home button , very simple and elegant. the other two buttons are soft touch  so they only light up when you touch the center one or if you are using the phone.On the Software side, It has Android 4.0 with an upcoming update  from LG  this year (2013). Android Runs very fast in this phone . Has a very good Integration with the hardware at disposal. Applications can be and will be installed in this phone .Live wallpaper runs smoothly. Wireless is excellent, because it recognizes 2,4 and 5 GHZ wi-fi networks.  GPS it's very exact although i do believe you will need a wireless connection for it to work. Need to test it and i'll update the review then .Another thing. This phone Being an Asian version comes with Chinese as the default language set. you will need to change it and it will promptly show at power up a message , you should choose the left option and it will prompt a language list. Sorry latin american folks but it has no Spanish/Espa\u00f1ol so use english or whatevs.Another thing worth of notice. This phone will work In VENEZUELA, But only with two operators, Movilnet  and Movistar. I'm not sure if Digitel Works but you should check the Frequency Range of this or any phone first  before buying as common senseOverall this phone is a excellent choice . I give it 9/10 points. Pretty, fast and spectacular. The Seller, Hasslefreecell Sent with the phone  a charger adapter. It wasn't necessary but it was very thoughtful of them .One thing You must remember, This is no Samsung S3/S2 Phone, nor an Iphone, Not a tablet. But it will prove reliable with office applications and such .Have a nice day.Thanks for reading this.Update 10-03-2013:This is Something I Promised So here it  is.I was trying the GPS and yes, it do works without Data plans or wireless connection.The thing is  it is not bulls eye precision, so you will have to adapt to it hehe.Of course if you are on the outside with the GPS on, Wifi on/data plan on , Then you will get more accurate measures.The other Thing i found out is this.A lot of users here are asking/complaining  about the lack of 3G/EDGE/GPRS/ETC data frequencies.Well the solution to this is that one must set the APN settings for the carrier of your choice so if you are in  Venezuela or other country, then try to contact your carrier about this, or look it up on the web :3, that's what i did and it worked, so that is my advice to you.Well that is mostly what i found out in this time. Phone still is rocking out, battery lasting almost 3 days with moderate use, hard as hell to scratch the screen, you get the idea. One word of advice:If you have trouble picking wi-fi signal with this cellphone , barring some exceptional circumstances, it's not probably your cellphone, It is the router.I ran into some trouble with an old router so if you have this kind of trouble, you might want to change it.That is all.Thanks again for reading this.End Update 10/03/2013Update 02/04/2013Well, LG never ceases to amaze me .This update is about the OS Software Update (*Snort*) That LG released this year 2013. This means that Now everyone has Android 4.1.2 JellyBeans Installed on your shiny LG P705. Now you all might be asking, What does this means for our cellphone? Well I'll try to point the most relevant points about this OS upgrade.All the Native applications have been revamped. They look really good and now they all have a biggest array of options.The user interface has been improved too. Now you can select the brightness of the phone, switch on/off your data plan, turn on/off power saver, turn on/off wifi hotspot,turn on/off airplane mode and turn on / off screen rotation without entering the system menu.The System fonts are now bolder so you can see everything better. This i like because it uses the screen at it's full.Be prepared. When you Update, all the Native apps the cellphone had (the chinese ones. I removed those at buying) Are going to install again. So get ready to uninstall most of them.Videos Look better than ever. I suppose they upgraded the codecs or something. Sound keeps being excellent.With AnTuTu Benchmark , before the update i got 3360 points. Now it has 4245. So now it goes faster hehe.The update comes with Google Now, which seems to be a great app as far I've tested. Good design and excellent usability.One Warning with Firefox explorer. If you try to update it and you get an error about data package, Uninstall it and then install it.Now, About how to update. You might try to Update it OTA but it might prompt a message about needing LG PC SUITE to update.So you should get LG PC SUITE as soon as possible from Lg official web. After install and cellphone connection, it will prompt you a message about the update. Be sure to connect your phone over USB CABLE, because for some weird reason, Wi-Fi would not work. (maybe because wifi might be unstable for a update???). Anyway the update process shouldn't take too long.Unless you choose to do a backup. I did it and it just took 20 min longer so it's up to you to back up (pro tip: do the backup).Well, that's all, Mostly. Ill test the phone more thoroughly to see what else changed.Rest assured that your phone will keep being an excellent phone. Only Better.Thanks for reading the update :3End Update 02/04/2013Update 26/05/2013Hello all, this is a new update for this cellphone review. This update is about a software upgrade that came out this day for me. It was signed with may 5 date and had 2,22 MB of data downloaded. It downloaded fast and updated faster. I haven't noted any changes in the phone's software, but it is a little faster.This update is probably a response to some screw up from google that is now flipping out with the location access of a lot of apps.Let's hope this works out for us .About the phone, it is still working fine. It has so much gumption that it is basically insane, and it is still rocking out.Bye, i'll update as needed.End Update 26/05/2013Update 16/06/2013New Update: The phone Had a major OS update this 16/6/2013. As the update said, 52 apps were updated, this seems about the internet app, saying that it has been revamped to have more speed when you navigate. I could not read all the update message  but i have noticed a bit of speed navigation increase in the phone.The update downloaded 15 mb of data Aprox. I haven't seen any major changes in the phone, except some cosmetic ones and a little increase in the software speed.The test with Antutu Benchmark actually dropped the score to 3186,tho i think it was because i have a lot less memory available now but who cares hehe.In all everything is well. Points To LG for having such a good support service, even overseas.The phone still is keeping up as a mobile gadget, so i can still suggest it as a good item.Bye all ,have a nice day.End Update 16/06/2013", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG L7 review", "Author": "Codo", "ReviewID": "R3EDIZR3F65R91", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing. it's like a mini laptop.The multitude of aplications downloaded on the phone keep me in touch with the world -weather, news, email, facebook...Its internal memory it's so big that i can download movies, i can record videos and still have enough memory for games or applications.It has lots of themes, lockers, widgets..I just love it, i wouldn't trade it for an iphone.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly suprised", "Author": "T. McCoy", "ReviewID": "R20MJGCRSXNZVL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had about 2 months to play around with the phone and am very pleased so far. I owned a HTC Inspire for 2 years before purchasing this so my battery and performance expectations were already pretty achievable. The phone arrived fairly quickly and came with a male micro-usb to male usb cable, an AC to female usb wall adapter and all the manuals. After the first initial charge I plugged in my SIM card and turned it on. I'm currently on a Family Mobile cell plan and works just fine after a few setting changes. Search for Family Mobile APN settings and it will show you how to configure your phone.Hardware:The phone is very sleek. I bought the white model and get compliments on how nice the phone looks frequently. At first I was surprised at how light it was but now the weight seems very natural. Some people dislike lighter phones because they don't feel as sturdy but it personally doesn't bother me. The back cover has a bit of a flimsy feel to it, but unless you're swapping out SIMs, MicroSDs or batteries frequently you won't notice it that much. The physical home button, the volume rocker and the tactile back and menu buttons are all sturdy and responsive. The screen lock button on the top right of the phone seems too recessed into the phone for my liking, but i'm sure it helps with not accidentally unlocking your screen. The AUX jack on the top left of the phone gives a snug fit and makes good contact with the male end of the cord.Software:To start out, I absolutely love Ice Cream Sandwich. It combines aesthetically pleasing menus with tons of features. One of my main concerns with buying this phone was everyone's complaint about the single core processor. My old HTC Inspire was also a single core processor phone so maybe that's why I don't notice it that much but i've yet to experience any sort of significant lag. This being said, I also compulsively hold the home button down and close any applications i'm done using so it doesn't eat up my process allowance and battery. I'm sure if you were to leave tons of apps running in the background or if you game on your phone it might under perform for you. Video watching on this phone is very enjoyable as well. Whether it be internet streaming or a local file the picture quality is quite impressive. Playing a Blueray quality video file on the phones stock video app plays without lag or buffering which is a huge plus. Screen brightness ranges from very bright to almost off but lacks an auto brightness feature. Rooting was fairly easy once I found the right software. I could not SuperOneClick it but the LG flash tool worked fine. The camera takes decent quality pictures, but the flash is weak. This is a main weak point for me because I like to use my phone as a flashlight, but now I can't.Battery Life:This was the main feature that drew me to the phone. The battery life on the HTC Inspire is HORRIBLE so I wanted to make sure not to make the same mistake twice. Average life seems to be around 12 hours with medium use for me. Juicedefender helps quite a bit, but I also have screen brightness set to 60% (which is pretty bright). I mostly only text, browse the web, and make the occasional phone call so I think 12 hours is pretty reasonable. On the HTC Inspire I would have got 3 hours, so no complaints here. The one thing i've found to REALLY kill the battery is streaming movies and music on your mobile network. When you're connected to Wifi it's not as noticeable, which I almost always am, but for some reason mobile internet drains it. Light to no use and I think the battery would last well over 24 if not 36 hours.Overall I'm still in love with this phone, especially for the price. For someone who is not on a contract (which I am not) ICS + good battery life + factory unlock + sleek design + under $200 = an awesome phone.TLDRPros:Interchangable long life batteryIce Cream SandwichAttractiveLightCheapCons:Low intensity flashCould be sluggish for some usersAwkward screen off button", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "HassleFreeCells", "Author": "CRISTINA STANCU", "ReviewID": "R39J03EDB67547", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I buy few of those phones for some of my friends. Actually I buy one and everybody liked it, so I buy for them few unlocked phones ( I leave in Trinidad). The last phone I buy for my friend, came here locked. I was very upset because the shipment cost me almost 100USD and  to send it back it cost me another 100USD  shipping + taxes) so I send a \"bad\" review to the supplier. Mr. Jake send me an e-mail stating that it was a mistake and he is willing to make it up for me only to remove the \"bad review\". I, like a truly christian and innocent,  thought that he is feeling sorry for the mistake and he will send the money to unlocked the phone ( so he let me understand in his e-mail). Of course since the moment I delete the bad review I never heard about Mr. Jake again. I just want to tell mr. Jake that that was not nice of him especially as a manager of HassleFreeCell.

The phone cannot find the 4g that comes with my network service (T-Mobile) and since I bought the phone unlocked, I tried to put another sim card with a different company (AT&T;) it still couldn't find the 4g or 3g. Also, the phone does not automatically remember the WiFi setting and if the screen goes to sleep, I will either have to wait for it to find the WiFi again or start it back up manually/ When trying to download more than one app or play a game/Facebook while trying to download something in the background, the phone runs slower. When trying to use the zoom on the camera, the photos don't come out very well. On the upside, the sleek look & light weight make for easy carrying and the screen is HUGE (but watching attempting to watch Netflix with the app is a joke!) I love the shortcuts and all other features on the phone & for the price (~$220 + unlocked/no warranty) it's a good bang for your buck, but in today's high-end Smart Phone world, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this phone.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "awesome cellphone", "Author": "Aladegbami olayiwola", "ReviewID": "R36H2K14WYVM9T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "great !!!!!!! i really like it which i could get more of the upgrade of the cell phone its awesome", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "Ivan J.

I like the way it feels on my hand; light but the texture in the back makes it feel durable. One of the best thing about getting this phone is that it offers free wifi so you don't have to commit into a data plan with every other smartphone out there. I'm always surrounded in wifi at phone, school, and atlanta is just swarming with hotspots for wifi. I got this phone for $120 when I signed a new contract my with tmobile dealer. You won't generally find this phone in most tmobile stores though. We went to an asian tmobile store that offers international phones.Anyways its been like two days since I've played around with this beauty. Lemme get down to business. You will not be happy watching video on this. The resolution is crap. Pictures are okay and the icecream sandwich wallie is really nice. I read several reviews about how slow the internet is being that the receptor for the wifi is made for the asian market. This is true. Initially it was crap slow. You can make it alot faster by changing the wifi setting to GMS & CDMA. There is three option for either or and both. After changing that setting I noticed the internet speed was moving a lot faster.If you're not on a data plan make sure to disable the data roaming option.  Every once in a while the phone does get glitchy but overall for the price I guess its a really great phone. There are tons of apps preloaded in there. You can also registered for the LG smartworld but its not required once you tap into the android market. The email was frustrating to set up at first but I think that was due to the laggy wifi. PolarisOffice can open PDFs yay *happy dance* Transfering music, pictures, and files into the phone is relatively easy.Overall I'm really happy with my phone.", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works well", "Author": "Carlos D.", "ReviewID": "RKO0MZZ83YAOV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "its a nice phone.

In fact, I ordered one for myself, as it is a great deal vs. having to pay a high price to upgrade with my carrier.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Nicolas Lomazzi", "ReviewID": "R3K8PVCAE81QUI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am thoroughly satisfied with this product in every way.
