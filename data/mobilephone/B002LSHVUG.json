Hochberg", "ReviewID": "R1X3KT9EGODENC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not an expert, just a regular guy who buys a new phone every year because I like toys.This phone has all of the important features I need on a phone. I have had other Nokia phones and this combines all of the great features and adds some that were not present. For example:1. 3.5mm Headphone jack. No more need for an adaptor for a 2.5mm.2. Bigger screen. I guess 2.6 is not comparable to other phones like the iPhone's 3.5, but this does not have a touchscreen interface. I can still text without looking using the keypad.3. The AMOLED display is rediculously clear and vibrant. My wife is using my Nokia E51 and the difference is stunning.4. 8 gb of storage plus microSD. This is more memory than I could fill up right now.5. This phone is also much faster than my E51. it takes less than 1/2 second to access any application once selected.6. Scratch resistant screen.7. The phone is well built, feels solid, a little heavy, but strong.8. The battery life is exceptional. I have used the camera for three days taking pictures, video, listening to music while I run etc. and still have 2 bars left.9. The speakerphone is LOUD. I can have my windows down on the BQE commuting to work and still here the callers over the traffic noise.10. Font sizes are adjustable and can be made noticably larger. I hate phones with tiny fonts.I can go on and on.My only concern is the camera. The video capability is great but I have been experimenting with the image quality and I don't think it is as good as Nokia will have you believe. The 8MP camera takes 8MP pictures, but they come out dark indoors even at close range with the flash. Outdoors they are as good as you would expect from an 8MP camera , and hopefully they will release the firmware update enabling face detection that has been rumored.Also, the notification light for missed calls, messages, and emails is kind of weak. My E51 would scream with vibrancy lighting up my bedroom at night, where the N86 is more of a whisper.I would reccomend this phone for many reasons.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "N86>N95>N85", "Author": "Andrew \"Andrew\"", "ReviewID": "R2O9SBOKJHKS9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well I just got mine today. Build quality is excellent, slider is solid, feels great in hand. Buttons are great, glass and metal/plastic case is top notch. OLED screen is also a winner, love the always on power saver clock. Overall, much improved over the N85. Phone feels snappy especially the camera, nokia messaging works well. Call quality is excellent. Pictures leave a bit to be desired, however I am used to this on early Nokia firmware. Shutter button is much improved over the horrible one on the N85. The flash is surprisingly good. The gallery and also photo viewer are still painfully slow to load the thumbnails, they stay blurry far to long, I don't understand this as my N95 had no problems here. FM transmitter is not as good as the N85, but still a nice feature.  Cell and GPS reception are excellent, compass I am sure will prove useful eventually. Overall hardware wise the phone is near perfect!  As I predicted this phone is the ultimate interpretation of the dual slider N series design. The firmware is surprisingly good for an early one. I think this phone will get a following with the N95 faithful and as a result will end up with an excellent firmware within the next year. I wish I never had to use the N85 for the short while that I did. If I had been going from the N95 to the N86 I would be overjoyed. As it is going from the N95 to N85 then to N86, I just feel as though Nokia cheated me on the N85.I feel this is the true successor to the N95, I cant wait for the v30 or v31 firmware, when the software is perfect.If you are looking for a powerful feature packed smart phone with an excellent camera, like typing without looking, one handed and don't mind that its not a flashy touch phone. The N86 is for you. Not to mention, you are free to multitask, don't have to pay for an overpriced data plan and it is a pocket camera/iPod replacement.", "Date": "October 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Better than innov8", "Author": "J.

Chang", "ReviewID": "R3G4IX8FYCXTNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To begin with I am guy who is all for the all in one phone. As a guy i put all my esential stuff in my pockets so it was very annoying for me to carry my wallet, keys, phone, mp3 player, and camera ... if you can imagine it was horrible. Having a phone that can take good pictures, plays my music all in one simplifies my life a lot. So I constantly look for a betteer camera phone. My first all purpose phone was the N95-3 phone and will be comparing it to the N86To start with I will be writting about the things that the N95 is better at than the N86The first thing i noticed was that the outer speakers for the N95 were a lot better than the N86. Before I was able to use my N95 as a music player everywhere, infact my phone could play music louder than my old laptop. However with the smaller N86 they made the speakers smaller, and as a result when you put the volume all the way up it doesnt sound as great as the n95s.The second thing i noticed was that the n95 had two shortcut buttons at the top, one that would acces the camera and would be used to take pictures, and the other that was set to go to your images and videos. The n86 only has the camera button. Even though its not esential I found it very convenient to have that button so i could quickly access my pictures without having to go through the menues, or even looking at the screen.The third thing i noticed is that the buttons on the front and keypad for the n95 are bigger and alot easier to press. the n86 buttons are kinda small and sometimes is hard to press if you have big fingers.This one I am not entierly sure because i havent played with my phone a lot yet only got it for a day, but in the n95 camera before you could change settings to take pictures with different filters, like a black and white picture or enhanced color pic, but i havent seen it on the n86 yet.Now for the things that the N86 is better than the N95One difference is that the N86 is smaller, so espceially for guys it is not too bulky in your pant pockets. The n95 was a bit bigger and blukier, however i do prefer the squared edges rather than the rounded ones but that is just my preference.the next most obvious difference and why a lot of people bought the n86 is the camera. The CAMERA IS AWESOME. The 8mp definately improve the quality of the pictures taken, the colors are better and resolution has improved. The dual led flash compared to the single flash in the n95 also helps take better pictures in dark room conditions or at night. There is also a focusing square that tells you were you are focusing at similar to that of a real camera. The n86 also has a sliding plastic cover that protects the lens from getting scratched a feature not present in my n95. (not the n95 original had a lens protector but was removed on the n95-3 which i have and the n95 8gb model)Another cool feature in the camera is the panoramic mode. This mode allows you to take pictures of a large area. this is done when the phone takes several pictures at key points and crops them all together making it seem as if you had taken a picture of a really wide and large aread. The results are awesome. (MORE updates will come as i play arround with my phone, I have only had it for a day as i said before)Another advantage of the n86 is that i has already built in memory and does not require a micro sd card. Although there is a micro sd card slot allowing you to expand your memory even more. this feature was not available in the n95-3 (only had micro sd slot) and i believe the n95 8gb only had the 8gb and no micro sd slotThey added a Fm tunner to the n86 that allows you to tune your phone to any radio which is useful when playing stuff from your car or anyother place.There is a small stand at the back that allows you to place your phone on a desk and watch things, much essier on your hands when watching videos. before you would have to hold the phone and if the video was long your hand would get kinda tiered ... especially if you were showing someone a video... I am sure there are more differences i just need to play with it more and will update more stuff laterMy conclusion IF you want a really good camera phone THIS IS THE PHONE FOR YOU ... the difference in picture between the 5mp and the 8mp are easily seen at least for me.UPDATE 1so after using the phone more i got more updates ... btw ... i am not talking about the oled screen because you can find it in the description of the product ...Ok back to comparing the n95 and the n86 ... so the n95 had the headphone jack on the side ... which was kina annoying if you were putting the phone in an armband to go work out and stuff cuz you couldnt fit it on the armband ... on the other hand the n86 the headphone jack is on the top making it easy to access and put on an arm band to go work out :)further more sometimes when you plug the headphones in it automatically detects headphones while the n95 you had to tell it you were plugging headphones in.also on the video format of the n86 there is a light option that will use the dual LED lights as a camera light allowing you to film at night a very very good function that the n95 did not havemore updates to come ... still havent fully figured out my phone yet LOL", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great phone, my first Symbian not my first Nokia, overall quite pleased !", "Author": "Daniel Golcher Quiros", "ReviewID": "R3ME2QBPBQUWJ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well what can I say, after owning a Samsung, a Siemens, two or three Sony-ericssons and two nokias previous to this one I finally came into the Symbian world.I must say given the OS and navigation I have always considered myself a SE fanboy, however I took some solid 6 months to review and read about all kinds of phones in order to retire my trusty C702.It came down to the new LG chocolate BL-40 or something (the one that looks like a widescreen on your palm) and the nokia N86.Given that I have always thought that phones should be operated using one hand if necessary, the N86 won over the sheer sexyness of the LG. (And besides I loathe touch screens!)I had my doubts as I've always own bar form phones, the less parts that move the better, I still went with the N86.After two weeks with it I have seen enough to communicate my opinion.Over all this is a solid phone feels heavy in a good way in your hands, the front is quite a fingerprint magnet but the scratch resistant glass is still flawless as day one.The dual slider mechanism has an adequate resistance in either way so it is not too hard nor to soft, it is not going to snap in your pocket nor you will break it trying to slide it.The slider mechanism feels tight so there is next to no twiching or shaking from the phone components when slided either way or closed.I have huge hands and the number keys are reachable reasonably spaced and sized, however it is another issue with the secondary keys (the ones that control the games and the media player) They are far too small and too close to the edge of the screen so it is quite a pain to use them and the D-pad is not as responsive or comfortable as I would have hoped for in video game action.The camera itself is just plain outstanding! Awesome pics, in part due to the good lens it has. The low light pictures are amongs the best if not THE best I have ever seen on a cell phone. The dual LED flash is also outstanding. The AMOLED screen is gorgeous and it has a decent readability in sunlight.I feel nokia over did it with the dual speakers as they really distort the music when played at more than 50% of the volume.Memory-wise you get 8GB in theory but given all the stuff the phone packs I think I remember seeing 6GB reported on the phone when I started it the first time around, but being able to handle a 16GB micro SD memory card should be able to fix this problem in case you feel 6GB are not enough.The phone itself is fast and responsive, I could ramble on about a lot of things but I'll instead try to just highlight my final opinions on it.PROS:Awesome cameraSturdy and well built, does not feel cheap at all.Great hardware overall with the sole flaw of the secondary slider keys design (too little space for big hands)AMOLED screen, WiFi, 16GB extendable memoryCONS:It might be me but I HATE the navigation in symbian, it makes no sense, where is the file manager, why is it so hard to install software made by smaller companies? (torch software, disable shutter sound)Missing functionality, no way to turn off the shutter sound and no torch light function, (although you can install it read previous complain) NOKIA COME ON !So far I would rate this phone 4.5 stars (Given I grow into the whole Symbian navigation) awesome phone highly recommendable.Cheers !", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent hardware, firmware still sketchy", "Author": "roidster \"roid\"", "ReviewID": "R1IELBJPE9XKWS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Quality photos, both indoor and out (best I've seen on a phone).

The best way to describe what I think of the phone is to list its pros and cons.Pros:- Good quality build and better made than the other phones I have seen or owned. The phone is not flimsy and doesn't seem to be made of cheap plastic.- Buttons are also firm and reflect a good quality design.- Plenty of tools and apps to keep you busy. I think the applications are in line of what you expect of an advanced phone like this. All the regular software (email, calendar, Media player, etc.)- Very nice display and crisp. The images you take with the camera have an amazing clarity when you view them in the display.- I like the fact that phone has two cameras. One for taking pictures (on the back of the phone), and the other is active when you take a picture of yourself (like when you are chatting).- The menu is somewhat intuitive to use and you could get around without a manual.- The sound quality (from the headset) when playing music is good and it is close to what you get from an iPod (and better than my blackberry).- WLAN works very well and doesn't have problems picking up available WAP nodes.- I am impressed with all the hidden sensors the phone has that turn certain functions in the phone automatically. For instance, when you flip open the stand on the back of the phone, it automatically switches to picture viewing mode. I have always wanted a stand like that for my iTouch iPod when I am on the plane and trying to view a movie.- I like the fact that it has a built-in dictionary and you don't have to be online to use it.Cons:- Somewhat heavy but it also reflects on the quality of the shell.- Too many menu clicks to do some of the frequent and simple tasks. The menu is rich but might take several levels to do something basic.- Minimal useful games out of the box - odd for a phone with this price.- I don't like the fact that you can't control the different sound settings for the various functions of the phone. For instance, I still can't find a way to control the volume for the notification of incoming SMS messages. It's somewhat annoying in meetings when you think set the volume of the ring to a vibrate and then a very loud notification comes on when you have a message. It forces you to switch to meeting mode all the time if you don't want to hear that. My previous Sony Ericsson allowed me to control a lot more and to configure what I want to hear for several functions.- The GPS is very moody. I wouldn't rely on it and I wouldn't buy this phone if the GPS is a MUST have feature.- For some reason, the phone doesn't always charge when you plug it to a USB connection. It works about 50% of the times. I noticed that if you shut it off completely while plugged, it will charge.- Battery life is not great, but I guess you would expect from a phone with all the bells and whistles.", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC Phone", "Author": "Craig Martell", "ReviewID": "RLVNLA3A4L1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not much else to say.

Shake", "ReviewID": "R3SZH8FWYLK4UD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchase Date March of 2010I've been a Nokia fan for several years, since the monochrome days, but I think they have lost me as a customer for good.  I have the N86 8MP which suited me for what I needed.  I was quite impressed with all of the features but the biggest issue I have with the phone is the ear piece.  The volume seems to diminish over time.  I called Nokia and I had to ship the phone in for evaluation.  They shipped the phone back to me stating they didn't know what was wrong with phone.  Apparently they didn't pay attention to the notes on the account nor did they make an attempt to contact me and question me.  Needless to say, I had to ship back to Nokia.  Now I'm without my phone longer than I was hoping.  Long story short....several phone calls to Nokia, 5 different shipments back to Nokia, 3 new phones of the same model and now experiencing the same issue with the 3rd.  I've read forums of people who are experiencing the same type of problem and the same customer service issues.  Since I use my phone with bluetooth devices, I don't use the ear piece that often but it is still a problem that should be resolved.  Nokia doesn't have anyone in their call center that can resolve issues.  I've told them how long I've been a Nokia customer but they don't care.  I try to go up the ladder to express my issue but that person \"isn't in right now\". I'm a very passive person but Nokia has forced me to practice my complaint dialog.  I will never purchase another Nokia product again.  I may reconsider if I  purchase through a service provider.  I feel they would at least correct the issue (one would hope) with another model or brand.  Shipping my phone back and forth is very frustrating.  For now, I will stomach this headache until my \"warranty\" expires.  The warranty period will help my patience in finding a new phone since smartphone technology is always changing.Update:  I'm on my 4th phone it and too will need to get sent in.  If Nokia would have honered my refund or credit request in the begining, they wouldn't have to keep dealing with me complaining about their product. I don't know what the issue is that keeps ruining the ear piece volume but it is very frustrating.  I've read in other forums that the map software might be contributing to the faulty ear piece.  With this being my 4th phone, in 9 months, to ship back, it appears that they haven't found a fix yet.Update  March 1st, 2011:I have shipped my phone back for what will probably be the last time.  I've asked Nokia if I could possibly downgrade to another model but when I provided them a model number,it supposedly isn't on a list that can be used for exchanges.  I thought a downgrade was receiving an item that wasn't equal or better in features than the item being exchanged.  Again....I know this is a product review and not a customer service review but the product is crap if it doesn't function properly and the customer service department won't help rectify the issue.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "A++", "Author": "Rohit Vuppuluri", "ReviewID": "R2CXXWNRA029VO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very impressed with the service and the phone seems to work very well.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Manuel A.

Sir!", "Author": "Nel's Reviews", "ReviewID": "R13UASALZU1V58", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With all the reviews on Amazon I have decided not to reiterate all the features the phone has because it has all been said already. What I will do is mention all the features I have used on the N86 8MP and the ones I have added. My husband has the N95 8GB and I thought it was a GREAT phone until I got the N86 8MP. I got the phone as a Christmas gift from my hubby and immediately added Melon Mobile's Advance Call manager application to my phone. My sole purpose for this symbian phone was to have the ability to CHOOSE who can call me and that is how that software came into play. For those who are looking to have a way that your phone will ring ONLY for those you allow to call you (from your contact list) the Advance Call manager application has resolved that issue for me. Also as with some cell phones you can also turn on the fix dialing feature, so if you leave your phone accidently somewhere no one can make calls on your phone. When the fixed dialing is activated on the phone, only the phone numbers on your contact list can be dialed out (including the 911 emergency numbers). Adding and removing applications from the N86 8MP is a breeze also especially if you like Themes on your phone.The camera does a fabulous job in taking pictures as well as videos. I have no complaints about that feature. When photos are taken they are saved in the GALLEY application on the phone so it is so easy to find all the photos, video clips, songs, and sound clips there.The FM radio on the phone is great to have...just plug in the ear buds and search for your local stations with out an extra charge from your service provider.I can't say anything about the texting or internet portion of the phone because they are not features I use but I have noticed a Facebook application on the phone for those who do surf the web.The audio on the phone is better than my late Samsung A777. When I receive calls I can hear the person on my N86 8MP loud and clear. The speaker phone is just as good also. I only wish they had added four speakers on the N86 8MP instead of just the two.The N868MP is a slick phone and not light weight...which is ok for me.If you are looking for a Symbian phone with a Great camera....the N86 8MP is the phone.", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "a great cel", "Author": "A.
