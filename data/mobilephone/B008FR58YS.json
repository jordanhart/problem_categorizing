Software issues, had to be brought into a service center to be worked on, also didn't receive an AC charging adapter. Would have returned it if I trusted the seller the least bit. Awful, first bad purchase through Amazon, definitely makes me doubt if I should make any further purchases through Amazon.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Cortez \"tez\"", "ReviewID": "R3KHEYP5AQDV1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is in perfect co diction....co RS with all those stickers covering screen and in original box!!!!extremely happy.
