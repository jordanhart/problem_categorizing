The navigator is extremely slow and freezes. The battery life is horrible. You don't get 4g everywhere like they made it seem. It drops calls a lot, and the quality of the calls with this phone aren't good at all and the speaker phone cuts out. The music player freezes. It turns off by itself to where you have to take out the battery and put it back in to turn it back on. It sometimes doesn't read the SD card for external memory. You can't send video or sound messages. There are no apps or app store/market. I've been with this company for years now and I've never had a complaint like this on any other phone I've purchased. And now with the price drop, I still wouldn't recommend this phone. I pay $65 a month for 4g I don't get everywhere, I don't even use the internet on it because it's extremely slow and the Facebook \"widget\" made my Facebook account think I was being hacked and it locked my account.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "DONT BUY THIS PHONE", "Author": "Cell-Wisher", "ReviewID": "R3JCPV2J1KKG2E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was the first \"4g\" phone Metro PCS came out with, but don't be fooled, it's NOT a smartphone. The only thing 4g about it is the proprietary youtube app, and how fast you can download multimedia messages. Nothing about this phone works as advertised. Web browsing? You'll be lucky to use wikipedia and facebook mobile, almost anything else crashes the browser. Many metro apps won't even run on it, because despite the huge screen the phone has zero processor or ram specs.  The touch screen is abysmally unresponsive, making zooming and clicking on small links an exercise in frustration, and the battery life is frighteningly short. I can go to bed with three bars of battery, and wake up to a dead phone. Thats with all the power-saving settings set to maximum. This phone was so bad Metro pulled it from the market shortly after it's release, and I feel like they should be liable for false advertising, especially for those people who paid full price and could have gotten an android or blackberry instead.  The phone frequently answers itself while in my pocket, as it registers every brush of fabric as a touch (but often wont recognize intentional taps). I thought it would be great for listening to music with the expandable storage and headphone jack, but you'd be lucky to get an hour's playback time and would then have to spend 3-4 hours charging the sluggish thing.  The fact that samsung released this phone makes me want to boycott purchasing anything from them in the future, although I know they are capable of making some great hardware.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "not what i expected", "Author": "Ricky Wilson", "ReviewID": "R3HHBOYPSCKWRQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i cant rate the phone but metro pcs sucks it works in kalamazoo michigan but not 25 miles outside of there so i was outside their cover area and couldnt use the phone", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "samsung craft", "Author": "Yolanda", "ReviewID": "R22DSFGBV1QTL8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It wasn't the phone I wanted and that was my mistake not Amazon's, the phone worked perfectly well.
