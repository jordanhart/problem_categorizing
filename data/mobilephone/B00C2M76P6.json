{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wonderful phone", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R1BV3SNFC99MNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't normally do these, but I am very impressed with this phone! Seller (Merimobiles) was very helpful with my questions, and the phone arrived three days from order! The phone itself is very fast and works well. Comes rooted with working Gapps. Very sharp screen, loudest audio from a cellphone I've heard yet and good quality, not tinny like other cellphones. Gets a little warm if you're playing heavy video games, otherwise cool to the touch. The best thing about it is the pentaband radio. I use t-mobile in an area that is split between 1700/2100 and the 1900 conversion. On my old t-mobile phone, I would often get Edge speeds. With this phone I get nothing less than 3G and usually H everywhere I go! And if I ever decide to go back to AT&T; or RedPocket, or H20, etc., it's got the 850 band as well.  All in all, very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mediocre", "Author": "O Parker", "ReviewID": "R39E6DECRYD5SD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Does not match up to the Samsung Mega galaxy for the same price.did not recognize my simcard Trouble connecting to internet via wifi.
