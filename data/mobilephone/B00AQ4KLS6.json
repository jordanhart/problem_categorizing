{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Really awesome Android phone!", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "RZ2RO0XRK5NOP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I switched from a Samsung Admire, so I was looking for a phone that had a bigger screen, newer Android version, and 4G LTE. The ZTE Avid 4G has it all. The 5MP camera with flash, the front camera, and Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) are pretty nice, as well as the 4\" screen (which I didn't think would be big enough, but I was wrong!) I've read that internal storage isn't great. You get over 2GB in the phone itself; I have more apps on this phone than on my Admire. There's a microSD card slot, too. I gave this 4/5 because the LTE is good but fluctuates between slow and fast sometimes; I also miss having Search and Camera buttons on the bottom of my phone. Overall, though, it's truly a great phone!", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone. Coming from HTC Evo 4G", "Author": "noirelion \"noirelion\"", "ReviewID": "R22UWDZCODES32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The call quality is excellent- the ringer volume is fine- same as any other phone. The Ice Cream Sandwich is neat- the unlimited data text and talk -and 4G- are a blast! Unlimited! Good speeds on data 2-6 megs down in Philadelphia. The phone is slimmer than pictures of it show... the camera quality is great for 5MP and the front facing cam- is nice for video chats! The phone comes with some metro bloat- but many of the apps were really useful- and there were many...The screen is bright when playing movies and to be honest my family members like ROOTING the Androids- but I can't imagine needing root on this phone because it has everything I can imagine using- already... the only apps I have added were games.This phone has a dual core 1.2gig 2gigs internal mem- microsd card slot (empty)....its fast and screen is sensitive  and responsive.It costs 149.00 off contract...so that is amazing...This phone is pretty nice for the price and 4G and a decent camera with a \"flashlight\" is something I needed.The phone is slippery- so you need a case for it most likely.I love it. 4G Ice Cream Sandwich -fast web unlimited talk text and data...Better than iPhone 5- (which is what I just got rid of.)... I love it!", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "As a Phone It Leaves a Lot to be Desired", "Author": "Mr Ranger", "ReviewID": "R24ZTILITN8RI8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As an Android device, it is very nice from what I can tell.  This is my first Android (smart phone) and I most definitely like all of the features.  I especially like the talk to text for text messaging. It is surprising how well that works.  I can now text with the best of them!When a new text comes in or a call that you miss, you notice a small light flashing telling you that you missed something.  When you access the phone however, there is no way that you can tell what you missed.  You have to navigate to the text messages and see if you can determine if it were a text, if not, then you have to navigate to the calls.  Very annoying.  Equally annoying; when you place a call, the moment you press send, the screen goes dark.  You have to press the top bottom to turn the screen back on so you can see what is taking place, or to activate the speaker if you want to use it as a speaker phone (more on this below).My primary reason for buying this device was to use it as a telephone (believe it or not).  As a telephone, it falls woefully short.  The ringer volume is about one half the volume as it should be.  If you are driving in your car, even with your radio off, the chance of hearing the phone ring is slim.  The vibrate is completely useless. With it in the case on my belt, the probability of feeling it vibrate is slim.  The clarity and volume of the phone holding to the ear is good.  Yet I much prefer to use a speaker phone; sadly the volume is so faint, it is completely useless.  There is not even a possibility, even in a quiet environment of using the speaker to hear a call.  If I put my ear about a foot away, I can barely manage a conversation.I am glad I only paid $149 for this.  I suppose I will suffer along with it for a while until I am completely sick of it and pitch it in a dumpster.  If I used my phone more than just a few times a day, I would not put up with this poor excuse for a phone for nothing.UPDATE: 3-8-2013  A month ago I gave up on the Avid and bought the LG Spirit.  The LG is a much better phone.  No volume issues at all.  I note now that on ZTE's site that there is a 304 MB update. Being a new model phone, I find it unusual that such a large update would be needed unless there was a serious issue as I experienced.  I gave the Avid away and when the new owner updates the phone to the new software, I'll try to remember to post up the results", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "CRAP", "Author": "brandon", "ReviewID": "R31KG0G4HPD4X3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this phone when my lg motion broke and I will say not an upgrade.

The screen is better than it gets credit for, and the volumes seem fine to me.Where it becomes almost useless (not hyperbole) is when you try to make a call with it. Signal reception is spotty, at best, but the true downfall of the phone is the microphone. Please understand me when I tell you the microphone is near unusable. I returned the first one I bought because I thought it was defective. The second one was just as bad. With or without a case, your voice quality to customers will be so bad that EVERY SINGLE CALL you make you will have to repeat yourself and talk directly into the mic.As soon as I can, I will be getting a new phone. I love MetroPCS coverage, cost, and no-contract. But the voice quality on this phone is a serious, serious hindrance.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "wonderful", "Author": "khairi G.", "ReviewID": "R1WJXOVO9SXDZQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this phone is great for the price. i was looking for something different than a lg motion since everyone got that phone and it is amazing! the speed,screen,camera,and gaming is awesome! i recommend this phone to a new user or even a android user.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "avid zte", "Author": "josh", "ReviewID": "R2JJYQUKRIAEBI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "No One can hear me unless I talk directly into the mic.
