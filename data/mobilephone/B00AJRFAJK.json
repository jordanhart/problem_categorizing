The plug on the charger is the slanted Australian version, but seller includes an adapter for US outlets, as well as USB cable.  If you are looking for a smaller size smartphone that is more portable, without being locked into a contract, this is a solid choice.UPDATE: After problems with the adapter, seller promptly sent TWO replacements.  This is a reliable company.

I wanted to avoid another contract but also wanted a smart phone. This one is suitable for me, but it is not a fancy phone. It has been very dependable so far. No crashes or unwanted resets. The battery life is great.  My only dislike is the camera. I miss having a higher resolution camera.
