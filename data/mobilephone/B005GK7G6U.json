The button paint started pealing after 7 months of office use.  My SIM card socket also had to be replaced.  This is the first phone I've ever had that broke twice in the first year.  Worst of all, the button failure is not covered by the \"comprehensive\" warranty.  Will not recommend it to anyone.  Only pro is the battery life, it lasts as long as those good old Nokias, the rest is bad.  I did not want fancy gimicks, but this phone is so clunky that it's counter intuitive - (PC synch is use-less as it craches 100% so no way to kae your numbers of, the SMS typing is painful at best, The software that run's on it you have to purchase by phone) etc.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "COMPATIBLE WITH 2G GSM 850/900/1800/1900 Network Simcards and/or\n3G UMTS/WCDMA 900/1700/2100 Network Simcards\nIP68, RUGGED PHONE, Factory UNLOCKED, 3G", "Name": "SONIM XP5300 3G FORCE BLACK RUGGED FACTORY UNLOCKED GSM MOBILE PHONE IP68", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nTWoFTa%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005GK7G6U"}}
