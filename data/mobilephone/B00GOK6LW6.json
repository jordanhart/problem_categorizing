The white color looks light-blue.2), both the rear/front cameras are fixed focus. It always takes blurry images for most the cases. For example, if you want to take a photo of a check, and then deposit it electronically by uploading the photo to your bank. Forget about this model.3), the total internal memory is only 4GB. After the OS and Apps, it may only have 500MB for your own files. Well, if you only use it as a phone, doing text, emailing, online accounts, and watch stream videos like YouTube, it will be just fine. (however, if you want to store a lot your own files like songs, images, movies, then you need store them at the external micro SD card.)And the minor bad: no NFC, not removable battery.Other than above, it is a low-budget fast Quad-core 1.2GHz smartphone with 4G (HSPA+) data speed (not LTE), and very good to use everyday. It does not have any add-on and you will experience the very original Android v4.2.2.In addition, with T-Mobile WiFi Calling feature built-in that, for example, if you are in foreign country, you can use WiFi Calling that can call or receive just as you were in States without any roaming charge.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Inderjeet \"indi\"", "ReviewID": "RSRF7UB7G6WTH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent cheap solution for my 13 year old.

At this price, I think it is one of most underrated cellphone. In its price range, it has virtually no competition, just like nexus 5, Moto g, lumia 521. I have virtually no complain except the subbar camera. 1G Ram plus quad-core CPU give it ample room to run most app except the most demanding ones. 4.5 in size LCD hit a sweet spot between oversized tablet-like phone and tiny 3.5in phone. Not the best quality, the qHD display is actually quite pleasant to ordinary eyes. Internal storage (4G) is too small for my taste, but many apps can be moved SD card, and these days $16 can buy you 32GB class 10 microSDHC, give you as much storage as many high-end phone. Out of box, there is 1.5GB empty storage left, which is better than I expect. It will drain about 8% to 9% battery if I leave it idle for one day, so standby time is pretty good.I haven't spent enough time with it to justify a 5-star rating. 4 for now, if it does not give me or my daughter any trouble in next three months, will come back and upgrade it to 5.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "You Get What You Pay For", "Author": "Machine Gun \"MnVols\"", "ReviewID": "R1WZTN2VHURNDS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I gave up my HTC Evo 4G so we could sign up for a family plan with T-mobile.

Touch screen, camera quality, and the overall look and feel of the phone is not good. I will say the 1.2 quadcore cpu is pretty responsive and apps open fast.  That's about it; I hate this phone and will be taking it back to the store.  It's a good starter phone for a kid, so if they damage it you're not losing much.

Six weeks later I could not get an internet connection for hours. Restarted the machine. The screen went black & couldn't be restarted, useless. Due to my ignorance, and lack of information from the sales person, I paid in full $150.00.  When I brought the dead phone to my local TMobile store the sales person said that I was not entitled to a new phone by a different manfacturer because I paid in full. A solution was to purchase another phone or pay $20.00 and they would send me a new Alcatel phone. Two weeks later I received a new phone. Now out of pocket $170.00. Four weeks the new phone did the same thing. No internet connection, restarted, screen went black, wouldn't restart. Back to the local T-Mobile store, same drill $20.00 fee and a  new phone. Out of pocket expenses would be up to $190.00, and the same POS. I got exactly what I paid for. Should have researched customer reviews before purchasing this POS, I would not have purchased it. I read very negative reviews about T-Mobile's customer service regarding this problem. I decided to cut my losses at $170.00, research a replacement phone by a reliable manufacturer. Called T-Mobile customer service expection no help.  They could not have been more helpful.  I explained my experiences. Without a moment's hesitation I was credited $170.00.  I have an affordable plan with T-Mobile. Their customer service pulled through. I will keep TMobile as my provider and thoroughly research a different manufacturer and pay monthly for the new phone.

There's some lag when launching more intensive programs, but it's consistent, unlike some other phones I've used that randomly hang for 5-10s at a time.-Battery life is also good; with wi-fi and cellular data off, it drained only 1% every 30m for me. (that's how I roll)-It's been reliable. And tough. I've dropped it numerous times (generally on hard surfaces), and I've never had it fail on me.The bad: the phone's a bit chunky, but hey, it's cheap. I only really have three bad things to say about it, but they're annoying enough to keep me from using the phone as anything more than a backup.-Screen accuracy. For whatever reason, it seems this phone doesn't always register my finger presses as having taken place quite where they actually did. This results in mis-taps when trying to launch apps and texting, and trying to use small interface elements (wee buttons and sliders). It's not huge, but it is noticeable and annoying. Possible I just got a poorly calibrated unit.-Camera. The color reproduction is fairly decent, but it's SO FUZZY. There's a lot of noise, and the lack of autofocus ensures that the noise is everywhere. Yes, that means you can't tap on the screen to make that part of the picture clearer. It is what it is, just like the no-focus cameras on the old feature and flip phones. They don't look too awful on the phone (see my next point), but once you upload them and look at them on a computer screen it becomes glaringly obvious.-Screen. There is ONE angle at which you can view the screen that makes it look passable; anything else, and it quickly degrades. It is terrible. This might be partly forgivable if the colors were right, but they aren't. Greens are ok, but blues and reds look purplish. I wound up using a monochrome wallpaper, because it was the only thing that looked decent.Bottom line: if you find a good sale on one of these, and don't mind the screen and camera being decidedly subpar, maybe it'd be worth it. But with the far better LG F3 not costing much more than this - and the excellent Moto G not much farther beyond that - I can't say I'd really recommend it to anybody.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't purchase this phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2R6Z8HMJ3GM9P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this phone mid January, worked well at first.

Then I started adding contacts. It wouldn't let me edit my contacts. Every time I would press on contact to edit it, it would call the person. I took the phone to Walmart and they had the same issue. I purchased Walmart's extended warranty, they said it is still under manufactures warranty, so I have to go through them. After coming here and reading users comments that he sent phone in and got one just as bad, I decided not to do that. That was before I got a voicemail for a job that I applied for ONE WEEK AFTER THE EMPLOYER CALLED ME!! I am always on my phone, and the message for the mail just popped up.
