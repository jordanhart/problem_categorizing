Unfortunately though it was defective. None of the apps would open and it was always locking up on me.

If I could give it no stars I would! I woke up and noticed my phone turning off and on by itself. I thought maybe this happened because I just recently bought a couple of apps off of  the google play store,and it some how screwed up my phone.so I immediately unistalled those apps hoping this would help ,Next thing I know my phone was on airplane mode even though the phone settings said it wasn't.I called verizon and they told me to reset the device, after resetting the device and losing my phone contacts, the phone started to work again. Hooray ! Now I don't have to purchase a new phone ,sadly that excitment was cut short when I noticed the piece of crap went back on airplane mode after ten mins ! I was back to square one now  Smh thankfully I was under warranty with verizon and didn't have to purchase a new phone they just sent me a new phone, well not really new , but thoroughly tested to make sure it was  a bug free device that I just received today, to make a loooong story short please save your money and dnt buy this phone , who knows how long these phones are sitting around collecting dust, until the next victim buys one .", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "The quality of this device is horrible.", "Author": "Trina", "ReviewID": "RY7XZUZD2K2WJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "You can't answer the phone when it rings.
