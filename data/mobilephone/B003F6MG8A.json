It came promptly unfortunately it didn't work.  The phone wouldn't charge and we didn't know if it was a battery or the plug.  So we called the seller and they were nice to offer to send both the battery and the plug for us to try.  That also came quickly and once we switched out the plug it charged as planned.  It was easy to follow the instruction included in the package to unlock the phone.  So the phone is working fine.  The only thing I didn't like is that it still has the T-Mobile logo hanging on the screen and some of the T-Mobile specific menu and button are permanently there on the screen even though we unlocked to use with AT&T.;", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Got a good deal", "Author": "Clarence E.

I was willing to pay a little more, when I got my original it was only $20.  But I didn't want the hassle of having to change chargers.  So, I liked the fact that Amazon offered the exact same phone, all I had to do was insert SIM card and it was good to go.  Had it for almost a year and NO problems!", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003F6MG8A"}}
