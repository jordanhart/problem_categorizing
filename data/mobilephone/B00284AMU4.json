{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent phone, but competition is stiff...", "Author": "FrankyS", "ReviewID": "R25VBTD38FRK0P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided to purchase the w995a after carefully researching some viable alternatives such as the Nokia n86 8mp, the still-good and underrated n96, and the n82. I chose the Sony because it looks and feels better than the other phones, not because it IS better than the others. Let me explain.This phone is absolutely gorgeous. Its made of brushed metal, it feels amazing in your hand, and the sliding mechanism is nearly perfect. It's a feature phone, so you really don't have any options to customize the UI like you would with a symbian phone (i.e. the nokias mentioned above), but if this doesn't bother you (which it did not bother me), it really won't matter because the menu layout is really perfect and intuitive. It has great sound, it's beautiful when lit up, and the call quality is superb. That being said, it's simply not a \"better\" phone than the nokias I've listed.For one, the camera is simply \"ok.\" Shots taken indoors will disappoint you, while those taken outdoors look very good. The video recording is old-school at 30fps QVGA while the nokias mentioned record DVD quality video at 30fps in VGA. Not to mention the nokias have carl ziess optics (regarded as one of the best lense makers in the world).I decided not to go with the Nokia N86, it's \"closest\" competitor. The N86 is a better phone, it has an 8gb hard drive while the w995a comes with an 8gb card. The nokia can be expanded with up to a 16gb card, has a variable aperture 8mp that takes exquisite photos, and has the ever- customizable symbian UI. But its ugly, and plastic; typical Nokia.So, to sum it up:THE GOOD:-beautiful-well built-beautiful interface-good pictures-excellent media player-best sliding mech. everTHE BAD:-other phones in its price range are arguable better-should take great pictures, not good ones-video recording is 2004-era phone-has a TFT 256k screen, while all others in its price range have AMOLED 16M screens.It was a tough choice, but for me, the look and feel of this one took the cake!", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "The last of the best before touch screens take over?", "Author": "Krishna Polina", "ReviewID": "R1QRTZSW8X0I36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Updated: Got a different phone recently and it didn't have the battery cover wobble I had with my first phone. I decided to keep this phone as a keepsake as it could be the best of last phones without touch screen.This review is very hard for me as I lovED the phone so much for so many things  but there are few things that really ticked me off for making me hate the phone I love so much. Sounds complicated? Well, first let me tell why I returned the phone.Reasons I returned the phone:1. Battery cover doesn't feel solid when you hold the phone and press keys. You will feel your hand pressure slightly pressing the battery cover that causes movement. This got very irritating for me as this is otherwise an excellently built phone that looks super sexy. First I thought it could be with my phone. But the replacement phone had the exact same problem. Then I went to couple of Sony Style stores and noticed one store phone didn't have problem but another one had. So, looks like some lucky buyers may get a good one but not sure how long that will feel firm if you keep opening and closing the phone. I do that quite often to change SIM cards.2. Fonts are too big for beautiful display with 2.6\" screen. Where were SE developers thinking? For example, the contacts screen shows only 6 contacts at once. With a slightly smaller fonts it would have displayed 8 contacts quite easily. They should have had a settings to choose small, medium, and large fonts and the current fonts should fall in X-large fonts.3. Kick stand. What a joke! The phone would have felt better if they left this completely or designed it in a way for users to remove it if they don't need it. You have to place phone in your shirt pocket with screen facing front or the kick stand would pop out easily. Another silly design by their engineers.4. 256-K colors. What are you thinking SE? When will you catch up with others here?Good things about the phone:If you already are familiar with Sony ericsson phones they have the best OS among non-smartphones. Frankly, they have many features better done than many smartphones including iPhone. First, the one's common to all new Sony Ericsson phones.Some of the cool things found in SE feature phones:Smart Dialing, ease of sending SMS, MMS, emails to a contact and the interface of MMS is super cool. I think they have the best implementation for MMS among all phones, FM radio, Accelerometer, Exchange ActiveSync (office outlook emails and calendar syncing and also to sync your google contacts and calendar with Push) and Call logs. With SE phones when in call logs you can select \"Open\" and it brings up all other contact information for that person like other numbers, email, etc. So, you can easily call that person at his other numbers or just send SMS, MMS, or email from logs. Also, D-pad arrow buttons can be used to create shortcuts (4 applications) to your favorite applications. This is one of my favorite feature in SE phones along with call logs and smart dialing as I hardly have more than 4 apps I like to use on a phone.When it comes to apps for the phone, there are plenty to feed your needs. Check out getjar.com or even  browse Sony Ericsson site from the native browser in the phone and you will see several free apps you can download. If you change the Location of the country in the sony ericsson site while browsing you will find more free apps as Sony seems to provide few different applications for different countries. Also, if you google you will find lot of Free Themes for the phone that will let you customize the look of the menus and standby screen.Some specialties with W995:1. In spite of the problems with the kickstand and the battery cover, the phone feels like a tank and it's sure to 'WOW WOW' your friends. One work around to fix the battery cover issue is to fold a small piece of paper and place it above the battery to stop the movement on the cover. Kickstand? Glue the stupid thing if you think you will never use it.2. Display looks super bright and clear even in sunlight.3. Walkman sound quality is simply amazing. I thought it sounded as good as Zune which I thought sounds way better than iPhone.4. It will be a joke if I mention having 3.5 mm audio jack is a plus with this phone. But, Sony finally did it. Good job there.5. WiFi, GPS, 3G on AT&T; all work like a charm.Some of my favorite FREE apps:Gmail, Google maps, Shozu, GetJar, TruTap, Fringe, Comeks, Opera Mini (of course), Blogger, TrackID.Even though I returned the phone I still am addicted to Sony Ericsson phones for their well thought out software for making calls and sending messages. Unfortunately, most of their recent phones have severe build quality issues. Most of them with the slider design or the battery covers. Still, I sometimes feel like buying W995a and deal with the problems it has as the goodness of the phone over shadows the problems. Moreover, there really is no perfect phone out there. At least for me :-(. Well, I even sold my iPhone after few months of use as I thought it feels too wide, battery doesn't last a full-day, and making calls is not as convenient as it's on Sony phones, or Windows Mobile phones, or Blackberries.The current $399.99 price on Amazon is tempting but I will try hard to resist until Xperia X2 gets announced this week.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Favorite SE Phone", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R147DODNJL3VUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The W995 is probably the best Sony Ericsson phone Ive used to date. I was considering higher end smartphones like the Sony X1 and Nokia N900 but couldnt bring myself to paying the high premium price. With the rate technology is going nowadays it would be worthless in 6 months, or the price would drop considerably. I got the W995 for a good deal and feel it was a good compromise. Physically the device looks very sleek. Build quality is very good with the brushed metal finish, definitely feels more sturdy than your average plastic phone. The screen is very nice as with most Sony phones Ive seen, very bright and vibrant display. Also I just learned that it is made out of scratch resistant material which is another plus. The biggest difference Ive noticed on the W995 compared to past phones Ive used is how snappy and fast the UI feels, especially things like browsing the internet over WiFi which is usually a chore on such a small device. Whether its the menus, GPS, scrolling on pages or turning the phone to landscape view (using the accelerometer) everything responds instantly. One cool thing I use the phone for (why I wanted WiFi in a small device in the first place) is to use it as a remote to wirelessly control my Logitech Squeezebox and it does it perfectly. Out of all the phones Ive owned, the SE UI remains my favorite because it is fast and to the point. The phone also includes an 8.1 megapixel camera, walkman with standard 3.5mm audio jack and 8GB memory card. Finally, Sony includes a 3.5mm jack on the phone which I dont know why they didnt do it sooner.. after all it is called a walkman phone. The camera also takes pretty decent photos, still some noise when indoors (or low lighting conditions) but much better than previous models. It wouldve been nice if it had the xenon flash over the LED, like on the C905. But the camera is not my first priority and its adequate for my uses. Ive found that as long as the subject is properly lit the phone will take good pictures. Using the phone for all the tasks mentioned above the battery has held up OK. Almost depleted at the end of the day but thats under heavy usage since its my new toy. For normal usage I think it could last 2-3 days before a charge. Guess Im just used to older SE phones which could last up to week, but they also did not have as many features as the W995. Overall, feature and quality wise the W995 is one of the best phones Ive used and probably the best non-smartphone.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great music player, OK camera, some annoying bugs", "Author": "Joakeen", "ReviewID": "R3RAPZLOMGXW5U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone from Amazon a week ago, after researching for over a month looking to replace my classic iPhone 16GB. I was looking for an unlocked multimedia phone and was leaning towards the Nokia N85. I have to say that while most reviews out there favor the Nokia, I cave into the looks of the W995a. Someone at Cnet said it is not the sexiest phone around, but I beg to differ, the phone is very sleek, the slider mechanism is flawless and the overall presentation of the hardware is much higher end that any of the new (available) Nokias I've seen. It is slimmer that the N85, and the brushed metal case is very elegant and looks way better than the plastic on the mentioned Nokia handset.It should be noted, as mentioned by other reviewers, that this is not a smartphone, meaning that there is limited customization and most of the applications you get are web based, a la iPhone two years ago. Since this phone is unlocked (something I really desired, and the main reason I did not upgrade my iPhone) you have to play around with the settings a little bit to get the most out of the features of this phone. For instance, I had a hard time figuring out how to get it to stream videos over the YouTube application that comes as part of the media interface. I have MediaNet (EDGE) service from AT&T; and was not able to stream any video. Then I discovered that if you turn off the WiFi you will get it, though a bit chopped since EDGE is not the best for video streaming. That being said, I still have to figure out how to get it to stream over WiFi, which should be much better. Oddly, most reviewers elsewhere had the opposite problem: they were able to stream over WiFi but could not get it to stream over EDGE. The workaround for the WiFi problem seems to be opening extra ports on your wireless router, something I am completely illiterate on. So this is a major drawback of the phone: for a phone that is claimed to be the flagship multimedia device from SE, all these bugs and problems should not be present, especially at this price range. Not being able to access YouTube properly is just unacceptable. Paying customers should not have to waste time trying to figure out things engineers and technicians at SE get paid to do. If you go to the SE webpage and look for support for this device you will be able to get the settings sent to your phone for proper web navigation, email and picture messaging... but nothing for the video streaming problem.This phone comes with an 8.1 MP camera with single LED flash. The pictures outdoors with good natural light are OK, but things get much worse indoors or with limited light. If you already have a nice point and shoot, this phone won't replace it. If you are looking for a new phone and to upgrade an old point and shoot, then maybe this phone will save you some bucks. Don't get me wrong, the camera is very good, it's just that reading 8.1 MP on the specs creates very high expectations.The real treat of this phone comes from the music player. The sound is just amazing. I did not know how much sound quality I was sacrificing with my iPhone and iPods until I listened to the music player in this phone: I was blown away. It should also be mentioned that the phone comes equipped with FM radio, which is actually very nice. The bundled Media Go software serves as an iTunes-like application to manage all your media files on your phone. It has a drag and drop interface that makes easy to add any songs, videos or photos to your phone, and guess what? Also from your phone to your computer (take that iPhone!). As any new piece of software, Media Go is not without flaws. When transferring songs from my library into my phone I received many error messages about unsuccessful transfers. I was able to go back and fix some of those but sometimes there were so many that it was hard to keep track (the program puts a check next to all successful transfers but puts no visual indication whatsoever next to the unsuccessful ones). It also failed to display some of my iTunes artwork. However, if you already use iTunes as your music player and media organizing program, MediaGo will easily import everything from your iTunes folder. Another important caveat is that updating your phone's firmware erases the phone's internal memory (not the memory card or the SIM card), so it is important to back up your phone using the SE PC Suite before every update.Call quality is just OK. It can get pretty bad in noisy environments, e.g. supermarket. Google maps works great. So, to sum up, if you are looking for a great-looking phone with a superb music player, OK video player, and OK camera and do not want to sign up for a 2-year bleed-out contract, you should definitely consider the W995a.UPDATE (After 3 months with the phone): So even though the media Go experience hasn't been the best, I was happy overall with the phone. That is until today when I updated the firmware. I backed up the phone as recommended, and followed all the instructions. Then, after the update I restored my phone using my backup. The contacts failed to restore and now I have lost all my contacts, but what is worse, all the customizations I had for some of them, i.e., ringtones and photos. Not only that, but about half the music and all the videos I had in the memory card got erased, which was not supposed to happen, since only the phone memory is supposed to be cleaned during the firmware update. All these things are just unacceptable for a cell phone this expensive. I never had such problems with my old iPhone. I will try to get rid of this phone as soon as possible and go back to Apple's boring but reliable products.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love the W995", "Author": "R.

This works especially well for web and gps.Much improved over previous SonyEricsson sliders I've seen or used.The only drawback is the poor battery life - esecially when using wifi, bluetooth, and internet capabilities.

I guess I guess I was spoiled when I was using a phone without these options since I only needed to recharge my phone every 3 or 4 days.", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "3 things that made this phone miss my 5 Star rating", "Author": "kits from VA \"gadgetGeek\"", "ReviewID": "R2FC1W96Z9WVJF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am using this phone for over a month now and am very very pleased with it. It would have got 5-Star rating if not for the 3 design flaws with the phone.1. Kick Stand design can't be any worse. It is not firmly stuck in closed position. If Sony Ericsson couldn't get it right they should have skipped this hardware. It would have saved them money and made the phone feel more solid.2. Battery cover - like others said in the review doesn't feel firm. You can feel slight movement when you press fingers around the Sony Ericsson name on the back. It feels little annoying to see a well built phone choke on battery cover design. I first thought I got a bad phone and thought of exchanging it but after reading reviews here and other forums it looks like a pretty common not with just this phone but several SE phones. I put a paper folded above the battery and it solved this problem.3. The Call Button and End Call buttons are not positioned ergonomically. They are located little too far from the D-pad and it hurts the fingers to reach them from center.Good things about the phone:1. Looks way better than in pictures and is getting lot of compliments from everyone who sees the phone.2. Feels solid and super sexy. Easily the best slider phone I've seen.3. Bright screen and very readable even in bright sunlight.4. Came with lot of games, applications, and 8GB Memory Stick Micro.5. GPS reception, AT&T; 3G connection, WiFi connection - all are very good.6. First time I saw a 3.5mm audio output which is a great plus for me as I have several good headphones I can use.7. To compliment the 3.5mm audio output, this phone easily replaces my Zune 8GB during my workout sessions. Sounds just as good.8. The flash themes are very very good looking.9. Battery felt average the first few weeks but seem to have improved greatly after few weeks. I am heavy user of browser, office outlook emails, calendar, and songs listener and the phone easily lasts the entire day even after I talk on average over 60+ minutes.10. Works with my office Exchange Server to sync Outlook Email and Calendar as well as my Google mail.Amazon has the best price for this phone.TIP for W995a owners: Install Opera Mini 5 beta. The browsing experience is excellent with small fonts.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "So far, so good!", "Author": "CL \"-C\"", "ReviewID": "R26NUI2P8DZUCC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Loving the phone so far - it's a nice update from my previous k790.  Speaking of which, all the \"cell phone\" icons on my new w995 are pictures of my old cell phone, the k790.  Hella random!  but yeah, it's been really good so far, except for the fact that Amazon Seller J&R; Music/Computer sent me a German phone, with the instruction booklet in Deutsche, and some strange Euro-charger with a bulky US adapter.I'm a bit disappointed that the geo-tagging photos doesn't seem to be recognized on my computer, but it locates the photos OK on the phone.  Lotsa pre-loaded and downloadable free games from Sony are nice!  Conversation-style texts are a nice new feature.  Battery life is awesome; usually 3-4 days between charges.  Best new feature?  The LED flashlight!  Speaking of which, photos in low-lighting are extremely disappointing and grainy, not sharp at all.  The kickstand is A-OK, despite all the other reviewers' claims.

Last year (December 2009) after much thought I decided to buy this model being this the top of the line of the \"old school\" SE phones and by \"old school\" I am talking about the W,K,C and such series and not the newest models like the AINO or SATIO. Anyway I ended up giving this phone to my sister and I bought instead a iPhone 3GS much to my dismay. Why? Because the [...] application in the W995a just can't compare to the iPhone application. Even tough the W995a screen is way smaller than the iPhone one the video resolution is terrible, really terrible and almost unsee-able. When I made a comparison with the youtube iPhone application the difference was abysmal. The other big problem is with the camera. I mean, this is a phone not a professional camera but come on, it says 8.1 mega and the photos are worse than your regular 2 mega camera. Even the iPhone with just 3.2 mega takes better pictures. I think is the lens quality (very bad) that makes the W995a such a lousy \"camera phone\". Don't get me wrong: this is Sony Ericsson at it's best and as always the conversation audio quality is great, reception is great but when you come to other features like web browsing and reading emails this phone really fails in comparison with any smartphone, from HCT to Nokia to Apple. Even tough the screen is bigger than other phones the text is also big so you don't really use the bigger screen and the small font is unreadable. In conclusion: This is one of the best phones available but as that is VERY EXPENSIVE because in other features like web browsing, reading emails (it can't read any office or pdf attachment) and almost other applications it fails in comparison with other phones, specially with a iPhone. It really is a shame because this is the end of a love relationship with Sony Ericsson I have had since 2004 and I never thought I was going to get a iPhone but this phone didn't meet my expectations at all. As the title says, the phone really disappointed me. One last issue: the keypad is awfully small and very very hard to use. Other SE phones down on the range offers better keypads. The walkman function of the W995a is great I have to say and the 8g memory stick is great. I know this review seems like a contradiction but it is because its hard to say only bad thing about a phone made by a brand you have been in love with for so many years.", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not a smartphone, yet pretty smart", "Author": "Haris Hadzic \"Haris\"", "ReviewID": "R2WMBJK1VKLJCR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not a smartphone, yet pretty smartAfter my Nokia E51 came to an end, I started looking for a replacement that would best suite my needs. Taught by previous experiences, my aim was a larger screen unlocked phone equipped with GPS device, intuitive user interface, decent sync, email and tethering capabilities, W-LAN and a modern media player.After days of research, my choice came down to two models: Nokia N86 and Sony Ericsson W995a. Both feature excellent characteristics, and seem to perfectly meet my needs. At the end, the design weighted in favor of the SE.The phone comes in three flavors: Red, Progressive Black and Brushed Metal. I bought mine from Amazon, and they only had the Progressive Black Model. Note that my model's name is W995a, which means that it supports frequencies across Americas, but rest reassured, it works in Europe and Asia as well on all networks, GSM and 3G.When you take it out of the box, it smells good, feels new and geeky :) Once you get to play with it, it feels solid in hand, and the sliding mechanism is excellent. The phone comes with an USB cable, wall charger, headphones, battery, printed and electronic documentation, and a generous 8GB memory card. Note that some operators in certain countries give you a set of plug-in stereo speakers, but those don't come standard.It's a slide form factor quad-band phone with 2.6\" display, 8.1 MP camera, kickstand, secondary video call camera, Sony Walkman with dedicated buttons, 3.5mm audio jack (thank you, Sony Ericsson, it was about the time) W-LAN, and loads of other features.At first, I found its buttons rather uncomfortable, for they are fairly flat and wide, and you need to operate them with you fingernails. The upper command buttons feel odd too, especially answer and hangup ones, for they are located at the very edge of the device. But it did not take me long to accommodate.The display is fairly large, showing crisp and clear images, and allowing various sizes of text to be displayed correctly. Its resolution of 320x240 pixels isn't exactly the top of the class, neither is the color range of mere 256k. However, I ran a test with a .jpg image taken with my Nikon camera on Sony Ericsson W995 and Nokia E51, featuring 16M colors. Surprisingly enough, comparing side-by-side the two models, the W995 display proved to have more vibrant colors, and the overall impression of the image was by far better Nokia's one.The phone comes with its own default animated and beautiful theme that goes great with its design. If you prefer the classic Sony Ericsson looks, you can switch back at any time, though the selection of themes that comes pre-installed is poor.Experience of browsing through menus, writing messages and making calls is ok, even though the interface sometimes lacks responsiveness due to animated themes and quantity of contents.Furthermore, W995 comes with tons of apps and features you easily get used to and never want to leave behind. For example, pedometer, accelerometer, shake control, location service, and many great solutions that exploit this hardware make this device a very versatile must-have multi purpose pocket device you always want to carry around. Less known goodies of this products are the camera flash that can be used either as torch or as SOS signaling device, and the USB battery charging capability. The last one is particularly useful when you say tether it with a computer to go online. This normally drains your battery very quickly, but in the case of W-series, your battery is being recharged instead of consumed. And when you press the +/-  volume button in standby mode, it displays a clock with some basic information across the entire screen. Additionally, the phone comes filled with cool games that are great for killing time on airports :) and a coupon for a free download of 100 Sony production songs.What I particularly liked about this phone is the ease of tethering with any major OS platforms out there. I've tested it on a Mac (Snow Leopard 10.6) and Windows XP Professional, and it worked like a charm. With W995, using your phone as a GSM or 3G modem is no longer a nightmare. The functionality is built right in, and when you connect it to any computer via an USB cable, you get prompted to choose amongst the fallowing: use your phone as modem, mass storage, file transfer, sync or PC suite.Viewing / listening to media content is an amazing experience. The interface is easy and intuitive thanks to dedicated buttons, and the sound quality is unprecedented. However, getting your contents to your phone is another pair of shoes.While the PC suite is an excellent peace of work, the software for Mac looks and feels poor. It all seems like sugar and cream for you PC guys out there, but what about us, the Mac users? Well, it's not that we're not taken into consideration, far from that. However, serious improvements are yet to be made issuing Mac-Sony Ericsson friendship. What you get on the Sony Ericsson web site is an iSync plugin (available only recently), allowing you to sync your contacts, tasks, and calendars between W995 and your Mac. And MediaSync, which is, or should be, the equivalent of MediaGo. The truth is, it allows you to transfer music and podcasts, but not the videos. Kind of sad. The good side is that it works well with iTunes library, and manages your music and podcasts flawlessly. Yet transferring videos between a Mac and your W995 still remains an issue. There are ways around, but they don't always work.On the iSync level, things are not shining either. With the older version of iSync plugin, the synchronizing process was fairly time consuming since it was not incremental. That means that every time you want to synchronize your contacts, tasks and calendars, it completely replaces the entire content. This was soon fixed by an updated plugin, so now it takes far less time. Furthermore, it crippled my address book since the two databases are still far from compatible.However, this all shows that Sony Ericsson is still pioneering in the Mac compatibility field, and hopefully these issues will be addressed in the upcoming versions of firmware. What I do like about the Sony Ericsson bluetooth syncing is that you can enable it to always accept demands from known devices. That way you no longer have to frenetically look for your device (pocket? desk? handbag? quick!), each time iSync starts. Just make sure it's within the bluetooth range, and you're in sync, with no annoying dialogues around.Another annoying thing about this product is the lack of support for certain character formats. So when you receive an email written in say croatian keyboard layout, instead of the actual content, it displays a \"unknown character set\" message. So it's clear to see that W995 is still pretty much an unfinished product, from the firmware developing standpoint.And now to camera! I had no special demands on my phone's camera, so I completely forgot about it. But when I got to play with it, I found that it's not bad at all. In fact, it's a 8,1MP camera with autofocus, flash, face and smile recognition, and loads of other features from the k-series! And the picture quality is awesome! Holy cow! The down side is that the picture quality suffers dramatically in low light conditions: the colors fade or go crazy, contours mix up, and a huge amount of noise takes away all the pleasure. So you can either try to save it in an image editing software or just be honest and conclude that the pic sucks. Up to you :)So the bottom line is: shot on sun, and keep the good impression. Another interesting thing about the camera is a dedicated shutter button. Very nice feature. However, it can also be a problem at times. You see, when you want to take a picture, first you need to press the shutter button halfway down, to allow the autofocus to find objects you presumably want to sharpen up. The process takes up to 5 seconds, after which you get this annoying beep, meaning: Now you can press the button all the way down. Yeah, right. Your object is by than far away from the frame, the kids are no longer smiling, and the dog just knocked off chasing his tale. This can be particularly annoying when asking someone to take a picture of you.Last but not the least: the build quality. Though the phone is solid and feels expensive, my recommendation is to pay attention to scratches and bruises. The chassis is extremely sensitive to scratches, and I recommend buying a screen cover and a some kind of protective case right away. The Sony Ericsson logo is subject to damage as well as the \"W995\" sign, since both are no other but stickers and tend to peel off with the time.All in all, an excellent phone, but the competition in its price range is stiff. Some software issues remain loose ends, but they'll probably get ironed up.the GOOD:-features (big)-camera (despite all the odds)-3.5 audio jack-unprecedented media experience-usb charged battery-intuitive interface-DLNA (haven't tested it though)-sliding mechanism-attention to detailsthe BAD-poor Mac compatibility-poor build quality of the chassis-lack of character support for many languages in default email app-kickstand feels clumsy-WLAN doesn't work in some hotspots-lack of search storage capability-browsing through address book feels like the year 2000-other small imperfections in firmware", "Date": "February 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone!!!!", "Author": "Alejandro Castellanos", "ReviewID": "R23TEMIFFCRU25", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great phone, solid, beautiful, user friendly, great software, large screen and very clear even when exposed to direct sunlight.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Rahul Agrawal \"rahulagrawal\"", "ReviewID": "R2SUVNGAW7P2NY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Small, sleek and slick. 8 MP camera takes really good shots during day, night time shots are ok. walkman and speaker is great quality.

All they tell you is contact Sony Ericsson. When you call Sony Ericsson customer service, they're very arrogant, and all they try to do is to let you use their support page on their website.The phone is good looking and solid, however many reviewers in other places [...] have returned their phone due to faulty battery cover that wobbles, and the kickstand is loose and doesn't stay in place. Unfortunately these problem occurs when your 30 days are up and you cannot return your product for a full refund!SE claims a 8.1 megapixel camera, but that is far from taking great pictures, at best their okay!The case IC-45 that SE offers for the phone is generic (meaning not specially made for this model) and when you put the phone in there the latch doesn't close and you have to force it. Forcing it touches the off button and your phone is off without you knowing it. The belt case is made of plastic that is very hard to use and that it can break easily!The GPS program that come pre-installed is Wayfinder, and it's a European company not even comparable to Tomtom, Garmin. Telenav doesn't offer a program for this specific model and their CS is another story.So basically you're paying for a great looking phone without any support from your carrier and SE.The music player (Walkman) is great and sounds great! Youtube application doesn't work, you have to mess with the firmware and it's not recommended for none tech savvy people! (this is where you find that at&t; doesn't care since it's not their branded phone and SE doesn't care since they really don't care after they sell you the device, and they tell you you should contact your carrier!).So, bottom line if you're tech savvy, you have $450+ to burn, and you change phone often then yes buy this phone by all mean. However if you want tech support, cheaper phone, buy a branded version from your own wireless carrier.[...]", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony Ericsson W995a", "Author": "acetolman", "ReviewID": "RODG7OKT3GGI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really loved this phone.

I have always enjoyed the walkman phones as a great sport phone even if i don't always use it as a primary phone. I can move my SIM and use it for biking, skiing, etc. My wife also enjoys the walkman phones as well.  I really wanted to upgrade here to the W995a for Christmas. We had one but over use and wear and tear it needs to be replaced. I really want to get a W995a and was excited to see it here on Amazon. I see that this same seller orderinstantcom has both listing right now on Amazon. They show 2 separate listing, W995A and W995. I have attempted to order from them twice, to order the W995a. And they seem to have a good price and are prompt , ship right away , and the product shows up right away. Unfortunately they have shipped me TWO W995 international version twice in a row. I am not sure how to tell them to make sure they send me a W995a.They A version DOES do 3G on AT&T; and that is what i am looking for. I have emailed the seller and also put a note in my last order when placing the order to ask if they could verify the W995a before shipping it to me. No luck. I did get prompt RMA service and FedEx the phone right back to them and am awaiting the credit back now. The 2nd order arrived today and was still wrong , so i am awaiting a 2nd RMA to get that one sent back. I am hoping to contact them directly and get a response because i really want to get the right product and am willing to try again and order the W995a if i can get the \"A\" Version.The plain W995 ( no a ) is still a great phone and will work on the GSM bands in the U.S. and overseas but will be slower on data and not support 3G in the U.S. the bands and electronics (internally to the phone) are different between the W995 and W995a and there is no Flash or Upgrade or Crack or anything you can do to make the non A version become the A version.Connectivity Data i got from Sony.Wireless Radio  GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz  UMTS 850/1800/1900 MHzCompatible Carrier & Service  AT&T;, AT&T; 3G, T-Mobile, Rogers, Fido3G  3G / UMTSWi-Fi Support  IEEE802.11b/gData transfer  GPRS, EDGE, HSDPA, WiFi", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "jesmc182", "ReviewID": "R2OFW6M4CG4AM7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good purchase, the service was awesome, I received the the item as they said.
