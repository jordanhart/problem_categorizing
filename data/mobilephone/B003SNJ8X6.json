{"Reviews": [{"Title": "There is a reason the phone locks after receiving a call", "Author": "MJay", "ReviewID": "R39KSG4QZ8KA6D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't quite understand why so many people complain about the phone locking after receiving a call.  The answer is very simple.  It locks so that when you put the phone to your head you don't activate commands via the touch screen.  Think about it.  You place the phone against your ear and the side of your face which can, and would, cause enough pressure on the screen to activate various commands.  Also, there is a button conveniently placed on the side of the phone that activates and deactivates the screen lock.  If I need to key in a number or get access to the touchscreen for any reason during a call just hit the button on the side, and Viola!, you can use it at will.Overall, this is a great phone, with great features, great quality at a FANTASTIC price.  Plus, there is a nice feature with AT&T;'s Go phones.  Say you have a standard phone account with AT&T; but want to upgrade your phone for cheap without having to sign a new multi-year contract.  Just buy the Go phone of your choice and instead of using the SIMM that comes with the phone use the one from your old phone.  I bought the LG Prime and installed the SIMM from my old phone and it operates like an unlocked phone.  I have done this for my past two phone upgrades.  It allows me to operate my AT&T; account without having to continually lock into a contract just to get a decent phone at a decent price.  Doing this, I can drop my plan anytime I chose or change it anytime I want.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Honest Review of the LG Prime GS390", "Author": "LivingFit365", "ReviewID": "R243BMUXSSL34S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to replace my New ATT GoPhone Samsung A177. Now that phone was pretty slick and looked very simiar to a blackberry. It got great ratings on Amazon. However, each key on my previous Samsung was about half the size of a sunflower seed!  Does your phone have buttons that small?  Now in the heck do manufactures expect people to use those keys?  I just couldn't stand it any longer and I had to get a new phone with bigger buttons.Enter in my new LG Prime!----Pros----What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This phone has pretty much everything you would need in a touch screen phone.1) Still Camera2) Video Camera3) Audio or voice recorder4) FM Radio! Which is unique!5) Music Player6) Scheduler, Calander, Note Pad,7) Clock and Alarms8) Email, Web, Text Chat, I.M.,And two of my most favorite features:9) Standard head phone plug jack which does not require an adaper. Not a proprietary connecter like some phones have.10) Standard mini USB port for charging and data transfer. Not a proprietary connecter like some phones have.11) Micro SD port so that you can put a micro sd card up to 15 Gigs in this baby and store all your videos and music and remove the card, put in a different card with more songs or transfer them from your pc to the phone.  So in other words, you're not limited to just storing data on the phone only.12) Speaker Phone! Contrary to what other people have said, this speaker phone works GREAT. I have had no problems with other people hearing me or me hearing them.... And more!What makes this phone easy to use is the fact it is touch screen!  It's almost like a little iPhone without the expensive price tag or cell phone contract. Apps are available but not as abundant as the iPhone. But for the price, you can't beat this phone!The MAIN reason I love this phone is the dial pad is touch screen and when you click on the dial pad icon it pulls up a large set of keys!  About the size of your pinky finger.  Easy enough to dial with your index fingers.Entering data for text chatting or schedules, pulls up a touch screen keyboard that is easy to use, the keys are big.As the date of this posting, AT&T; has two really cool plans you can use with the GoPhone. You can pay-as-you-go by adding a dollar amount to your GoPhone and just pay a per min. charge for your airtime. The other option is you can pay a single rate each month and get unlimited calling, text and web WITHOUT signing a contract!Additonally as the date of this posting, if you search on Amazon for the key word: LG Prime, there are some nice accessories you can get for this phone. Such as: cases, headphones, screen protectors USB data cables and such.The LG Prime GS390 is light weight, slim (not bulky). The screen is is about 2/3 of the overall phone's total size, which means that the screen is big enough to see the dial pad and other options without having to squint.The screen resolution is high enough that all the graphics and text display with smooth edges. The benefit of this means that everyting on the screen is nice looking and easy to see.The screen is very clear and bright when viewed indoors.  Outdoors In bright, overhead sunlight, the screen is bit harder to see but not impossible.  In the shade or showdows the screen is much easier to see.  Sitting parked in your car on a bright, sunny day without the sun directly shining on you, the screen is bright and clear and almost as bright as being indoors.----Cons----Nothing major that I can think of at the moment.The only thing that can be difficult to get used to is the touch screen controls. once you get used to that the phone is easy to use.---------Conclusion---------The LG Prime GS390 is a techologically advanced, touch screen phone that is very affordable. It has many of the high tech features of more expensive phones. Call quality and the graphical user interface and dial pad keys are great.  Best of all you can add a dollar amount to the phone and do a per min charge, or pay a monthly, flat fee and get unlimited air time.  All this without a contract.  A great deal!------------------------------If you enjoyed this review you might enjoy other reviews from me. Please click the text link at the top of this review called: \"See all my reviews\".

I was hesitant at first to get a pay-as-you-go phone, but as soon as I saw this phone being offered at at&t; I thought I would give it a shot. I use my phone mainly for text messaging and the occasional call, so this phone is perfect for me (I got a $10/month for 1000 text message plan added to the $1 mobile to mobile plan).As for the actual phone, I think it is great. I have never had a touch screen phone, so I don't have much to compare it to, but for a first time user of a touch screen phone it has been fantastic. It took some getting used to, but I love it. I haven't experienced any frozen screens as I have heard people complain about on other touch screen phones. The ring can be nice and loud if you want it, and the screen is very easy to read. You can change the font sizes too, which I know is useful for some people.The only negative thing I can say about this phone (and maybe it is something that can be fixed but I haven't figured out yet) is that during a phone call the screen will lock. This is fine, but if you are calling your voicemail, or a number where you have to select options from a menu, it can get to be pretty annoying. Other than that, the complaints I have had about phones in the past (bad voice call quality, bad battery life) have not been present with this phone. That being said, I have only had it for about a week so we'll see.Oh and the $50 credit makes this phone totally worth the money.*Update*Ok, I have had this phone for a month now. And there are a few things I have noticed. Sometimes when I use the camera feature on the phone, the screen will flash and act really weird. But this is resolved from just turning the phone off and turning it on again. Also, I will sometimes press a button to get the screen to display so I can see the time, and the clock on the phone is not correct. Again, this is resolved from turning the phone off and then on again. These are pretty minor problems, but I thought I would add this to my review and let people know.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Blown Away", "Author": "D. Scoggins", "ReviewID": "R8QM1305EZKXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am cheap when it comes to cell service. That's not to say I've never had a contract, I just didn't feel that I was getting my moneys worth. I overpaid even with the cheapest of plans. I don't talk very much and I'm a light texter. So for the last few years I've used prepaid services with cheap phones. I recently saw that not only did AT&T; go to 10 cent a minute, they had added some better phones. I wanted to try a full qwerty phone, be it touchscreen or slider. Then I saw the LG Prime that not only was it feature rich but came with a 50$ credit. I did some research and red a ton of reviews and decided to give it a shot.WOW.Pros:Being that I am a bit behind on current cellphone technology(I came from a LG600G, Tracfone) I instantly had a phone with a touchscreen, usable web browser, 2 mp camera, camcorder, FM receiver and -OMG- an MP3 player. Little did I know how awesome it was to have all this on a phone.Music: By far the best feature to me is the MP3 player hands down. While its not the best sounding player I've ever had it is nice and loud. I can listen to it w/o headphones. I put an 8gb card in it and went to town. The FM receiver works ok but I mainly use the MP3 player. O yea, Praise God there is a standard headphone jack.Internet: As I said the browser is usable. I will load full pages but I mostly go to mobile versions of my favorite sites(tomshardware, facebook, wikipedia).Camera: 2mp takes decent shots and the camcorder is nice to have in a pinch.Touchscreen: The screen is resistive but is responsive and doesn't require a lot of pressure and the menus scroll and navigate pretty fast, there is some lag when loading the music player but I have noticed this get longer with the more songs I have on my memory card.Cons:Data/Internet: This could be a deal killer for some people. Data is very, very expensive. I really think AT&T; could do a lot better on the rates. 5$ for 1mb and 20$ for 100mb. This is ridiculous. If you are a heavy user then get a data plan otherwise you will get taken to the cleaners.(see Conclusion)UI: Unless I am missing something, I do not see a way to customize the UI beyond adding a few widgets(6 to choose from, whoopee). While the clock, calender and note widgets are very useful I wish there were a way to add other tools to the shortcut menu or even the screen. The calculator, unit converter and tip calculator are buried in the menu and should be easier to navigate to.Conclusion: Even with the ripoff prices for data and issues I have with the UI, this phone is an incredible deal. As for the data, I purchased the 20$ 100mb feature and I have it renew the 5$ 1mb every 30 days so that my 100mb balance will roll over. So far I am using approximately 5mb a week, It will take me 5 months to use that data at my usual rate. during those 5 months I will renew each month 1mb for 5mb to roll over my balance. So 6 months of data service will cost me 45$. So thats approximately 7.50$ a month to have email and light surfing access, 5$ a month to have 200 texts and if I use 100 mins a month(typical for me) Im'm in for 22.50 per month with no crap fees. Thats an average I know I will sometimes use more or less.For the price of the phone (80$) minus the 50$ airtime this is a great deal for light phone users who don't want to have a 80-100$ cell bill.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG Prime Good and Bad", "Author": "William", "ReviewID": "RLZVG970U56JH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the sound quality of the phone and the ease of making the ring and volume loud or soft.The battery life is good and I have had no sim problems. What I dislike about the phone, however, is the continued locking when you are on a call. Trying to deal with a menu selection is very difficult as you have to constantly keep unlocking it. If you receive a second call while you are on the phone, you cannot see who is calling you because the screen keeps locking up. The phone would be very good if they could fix the locking issue.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG Prime, good entry level touch screen", "Author": "ss", "ReviewID": "RMQP3FTHBJVX4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The delivery, the free air time, and the SIM:My LG Prime was delivered at a great price, and came a day early - thanks for another great experience from Amazon and their suppliers.  Tracking worked, too.  The LG Prime had a sticker on the back upon delivery telling me to boot up with my old SIM card, and that I could receive the free air time when I did this - worked great for me, but I caution that Amazon, LG, and AT&T; did not know how the phone would be received, or if this was possible - so maybe it changes by area.BEFORE I DID THIS, I backed up my contacts on my old phone to my SIM, then transferred the old SIM to the new phone.  My contacts transferred perfectly, and my phone number was in tact, no problem - fired right up, WITH MY FREE AIR TIME.  Worked nice.AND I DID NOT START MY NEW PHONE WITH THE NEW SIM CARD, SINCE THAT NEW SIM CARD WOULD HAVE A NEW PHONE NUMBER - I ONLY STARTED WITH THE OLD ONE - NOT SURE IF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM AS FAR AS THE FREE AIR TIME - I STRONGLY SUSPECT IT COULD BE, BUT MAYBE NOT.  In that event, you should be able to use the new SIM until the credit is gone, and maybe switch back and forth as needed.  TALK TO AT&T; FIRST if you did this by mistake, or for the best advice.The touchscreen:The LG Prime is a good entry level touch screen phone.  Others say the touch screen is not very sensitive, but it is easy for you to get used to it.  If you never had an iPhone, or a highly sensitive 'capacitive' touch screen, you likely will not notice this.  In the past, I had a capacitive touch screen, and it still doesn't bother me.  In the future, when I spend a lot of money for a top-of-the-line smartphone, I will insist on a capacitive touchscreen, or AMOLED - but mostly because I am paying for it.For the price, I have seen touchscreens which are much worse than this one (usually resistive with thin, soft plastic screens), and even require a stylus - not the LG Prime - my fingers work fine, and the screen is glass (or very hard plastic which looks like glass - not 100% sure, seems like glass - I haven't scratched it yet either, but hasn't been very long either - seems like it could be pretty good surface.  Screen protector might make the screen less sensitive, also.If you really want the best touch screens, 'capacitive' and 'AMOLED' touch screens are the best - AMOLED promises to be the best by far, and takes less power because it is LED.  At the time I am writing this, it seems to me that the 'capacitive' touchscreen phones start around 200 bucks, and AMOLED touchscreens 600 bucks.The OS:In the past I had an iPhone 3G, and loved it.  LG Prime does not really compare to that very much - only in some ways.  The power and speed of the phone hardware/connectivity make me feel like I will not fully use the very good Android OS which is installed - mostly just talk and text.  (However, you might be in an area where you are less capable on speed anyway - see below).  Android looks very good to me, but look to other reviews for full web/email functionality of this phone, also.The connection speed:This phone is not terribly slow, but this is not a 3G phone, is not UMTS/HSDPA, and does not have wifi.  If you want high speed data transfer, (with AT&T; or through a wifi), you MIGHT need to go to another phone with better network connectivity, wifi, and/or even a phone with a better processor.  HOWEVER - if you live in an area where 3G, or UMTS/HSDPA, or EDGE/GPRS capabilities are not available anyway (meaning your area is 2G/GSM only), maybe this can work for you since you will likely be slow with any phone.If you don't know about your network, check AT&T; maps for your areas coverage - make sure you click 'voice, data, go phone, 3G' tabs above the map, also:[...]Although I have not fully tested the web/email capability of the LG Prime, I checked the weather with the web browser once - speed was OK, not great - looked at radar maps on weather.com, (2 different maps) - costed me $2.50 to do this - took me 90 seconds or so - in what is a very good AT&T; area, (best AT&T; GSM color on the map linked above).  OK - maybe i had my $1/day charge included in that, but I don't think so.Either way, if your web browsing/emailing everyday, you should get a data plan.  In fact, unlimited data plans might make this worth while for some people, but for me, my laptop will do this faster for now.  In my opinion, if I will attempt to replace my laptop, (or even tether my laptop, which LG Prime will not do), LG Prime won't do it - not very close - whereas the iPhone3G was close - I would often pick up my iPhone3G instead of my laptop - not with the LG Prime, not in my area, not for me.  This also does not speak against the Android OS, only the fact that the phone has lower technology connectivity, and therefore lower speed.  (Near my signal bars, the phone always reads 'E', and this phone will never be able to say '3G' or 'EDGE' the way it is built).If others say they are good with the web/email capability of Android OS - I would say they are right, I'm mostly saying look at this phone's capability versus a better connected/higher processing phone - if it is important to you, or even available to you.USB Cable connectivity:This phone is an LG Prime GS390.  DO NOT BUY A USB CABLE for any other type of phone.  I bought the cable:  USB Sync Charging Data Cable for LG Vu CU915 CU920, GT365 Neon, VX10000 VoyagerLG Customer service told me this cable would work on the LG Prime and it did not!  My only other experience with them was OK, but not this bad - hit and miss - like most customer service these days, right?  (LG says it's a new phone and they didn't have the specs at customer service yet - but they said it would work on my first contact with them.  So help me, or buy/send me a cable, right?  Nope, not even after I requested a new cable.)  Then they updated the webite after the mistake with me (next day), to include the LG Prime, (wasn't listed before this) - so you're welcome - but still no cable.  :-)The phone/software speed:The processor/software is very adequate for talk and text - it can slow the screen, but only rarely it seems, and never for a long time - mostly it keeps up and is highly responsive, but not instant.  (I put an 8GB microSD in to store my contacts, photos, etc., also - cost me 15 bucks - probably helps the speed a little).  As far as I know, only most expensive and newest smartphones will respond instantly - seems to be true in my experience and reading.The Apps:For now, AT&T; has an app store, and so does Android - hopefully another reviewer will clear up where the best apps are for the LG on the Android platform.  Hard to say for me, but I will post again if I learn more about this.You can do a google search for the best Android Apps and learn a lot that way, also - depends what you want - I think the options are very good now.LG also states they plan to have apps available in their app store worldwide - the USA Appstore is the last to come on line on the LG website.  USA does not have a date posted for LG to start up the app sales - not that I have found.  Likely, Android and AT&T; have apps covered very well, and you don't need LG, but it might be interesting to see what LG puts forward for their phones.Overall:For the price, the good delivery, the 'seems very good so far' Android OS, the smooth SIM change, being able to transfer my free air time, keeping my contacts, and for a nice looking phone/touchscreen/display, I give 5 stars.  After I shopped, I couldn't find a glass touchscreen phone with this kind of capability at a better price.  And I am very pleased to not be using my entry-level Nokia go phone anymore.  If the price was higher, I would remove a star for the screen locking/unlocking button, and how it functions - but I am used to it already, and who am I to complain about one semantic when the price is so very right.  And if it bothers me later, I will make it better by gently filing the top of the button down so it can't be bumped anymore.  So 5 stars it is.This was a great deal by Amazon at the time I purchased it.  (My local AT&T; store didn't even want to try to match or beat this price, either.)  With all of this, my satisfaction level is very high, but know what you are buying, also.  My review is not negative on the LG Prime, but rather intends to help you understand what you are reviewing/buying.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "pretty neat", "Author": "wit_11", "ReviewID": "R1XNGX3RNG22UQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I've only had this phone for one day, but so far I love it. The features are unbelievable for a \"go\" phone. The camera's pretty good, and it also has a video recorder.

There are also widgets you can drag onto your main screen, which is pretty cool. There's also a button to unlock the phone on the side if you don't want to have to push the unlock button on the screen. The ring can get VERY loud if you want it to.

I know others also complained about this feature, even when you turn off the auto lock feature, if a call comes in or if you even make a call it locks....and why? LG must have been drinking some pretty good stuff when they decided to go there with this phone. Calls are clear, texting is nice because you can see the previous texts sent. The camera isn't too bad. It's a keeper. Plus you get $50 airtime if you had your current sim card for 4mos or more, it loaded right into the phone, no need to call cs.

So in other words, if you type more than a few words, the text arrives in several fragments and not in the order you typed!OH...there's more. When texting, you have to turn on spell check every single text! Sometimes even a few times PER text! It does not stay on or do it automatically. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying.The phone also locks immediately, no matter how many times you set it to \"every 45 seconds\" or OFF completely. In other words...you can't control the locking. Period.  It is very, very annoying to have to unlock it every few SECONDS.The camera is terrible. Grainy, dark, etc. It is hardly worth using unless you are in absolutely perfect daylight.You have to click over to answer a call waiting, and when you do, it often disconnects both parties. Not good. As well, the other party can hear the beep of any call or text you receive, which is not good if someone is calling or texting obsessively while you are on the phone.You have to SET the phone to where your voicemail will give you the time and date of the call! Who on earth would ever choose not to get a time and date when they retrieve their messages?  Why must we use a setting for this?After I returned the first LG Prime and got a new one, ALL of these same problems arose.  If you are unfortunate enough to be with AT&T;, because you are not in a  million dollar a month contract with them...they send you to a DIFFERENT tech support. It is CLEARLY in the Philippines and with all due respect, they don't appear to know ANYTHING about these phones, what-so-ever!They CANNOT fix the issues I mentioned. LG Prime themselves play dumb and try to blame it on AT&T.; AT&T; blames it on LG Prime. So we get nowhere. I am stuck with this thing. I'd like to add...NO ONE I know has this phone or has even heard of it. I got it after I lost two horribly expensive iPhones (which I loved). I mistakenly, VERY mistakenly, thought this was \"the next best thing.\"  IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM is this similar to the iPhone.The good points? It's small and makes calls. Other than that, it is totally useless. In all truth, they had no business releasing this thing to the public.UPATE:  March 16th. Phone is still terrible and all problems remain. NO ONE at AT&T; or LG Prime would take any responsibility for the issues with EITHER of the LG Primes I bought (the original or replacement). So nothing was ever accomplished. I love these new oh-so-happy reviews! I'd love to hear from them all a few months down the line!  This is a bad phone by default. Now that work has picked up for me again, I am going to take a hammer to this phone in the alley. I will leave AT&T; (along with everyone else) and get a Droid phone and accept the $99 or so a month.

This is a veritable bargain at $99.99 or less, and I couldn't resist getting it to initiate GSM service with AT&T.; I liken going from a conventional flip phone to this touch screen to putting someone in a stick shift car that's driven an automatic for the last 40 years.  The  munchkin sized owner's manual is the worst I've ever had the misfortune to try to use. No meaningful index, very vague tutorial on features, pictured icons (in the manual) so small as to be illegible. Sadly, there isn't (yet?) an online manual which one may print out..Still....I think I'm going to really like this phone. (naww[...] update) FM radio with or without a wired headset, very good volume in ALL functions including speakerphone, a whole bevy of  intriguing  foo-foo  features.  Bluetooth wireless headset stereo capability on music IN the phone, FM radio wired headset only (or no headset)..I was able to assign this phone to the standard AT&T; minutes plan rather than their prepaid \"GO\" plan. Strangely, about half of the AT&T; and independent stores said it HAD to be a \"prepaid GO phone\", half had no problem using it with a conventional plan and SIM card. Happy days! A conventional plan, month-to-month WITHOUT a contract. I'm thrilled..I'll shoulder most of the blame for the problems I'm having with the touch screen.  I don't think it's the most user-friendly touch screen (particularly compared to my GPS units), but I'm learning..This LG Prime LGS390 phone has (at least initially) had the most favorable feedback from users of ANY cell phone. IMHO it benefits in quality from being made in Korea (LG is Korean) rather than China. Just an opinion..I find it interesting that LG initially stood for \"Lucky Goldstar\" for years. Now it's either \"Lets Go\" or \"Life's Good\".  Sounds more `Western', I guess..A good phone.  Go for it.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>ADDENDA: A few disappointing qualities have arisen since my initial report. This phone WILL NOT work with a (blue tooth) \"X Link\". THIS IS A BIG ISSUE FOR ME!!  First phone EVER that wouldn't.  X Link even has a downloadable  \"LG patch\" to correct problems. This with the latest X Link software is of no use.  In addition, the voice recognition is very poor, and takes three operations to access that function. Also, there is apparently no way of enabling any audio notification of messages received and waiting. (At least as far as I'm able to discern with the nearly worthless owner's manual)  Some silliness from the owner's manual pages 98 & 99:\"Hold the phone as you would any phone with the antenna pointed up and over your shoulder.\" ...\"Do not touch the antenna unnecessarily when the phone is in use\". Gee! I was shorted the aforementioned \"antenna\".My wife absolutely hates this phone. All the `bling bling' features (FM Radio, etc.) don't get it with her. I am forced to get her a conventional flip phone. This is NOT a user friendly device for placing  phone calls QUICKLY without an error every fourth time or so.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>ADDENDA II: 8-29-10  I had to throw in the towel on these phones. Squeeked by on the 28th day of my 30 day 'satisfaction guarantee' and sold 'em back to AT&T.; It is absolutely ESSENTIAL that my Intellitouch X Link be operational. My wife was about to throw hers over the fence into the neighbor's swimming pool. I am now using two bare-bones Nokia 2720. And I REALLY mean bare bones. The bluetooth connectivity is fantastic! They're either $7.99 -referb. or $9.99 brand new from AT&T.; Just like finding them! No micro-sd capabilities, very limited internal memory.

I do have a Windows Mobile phone that's a couple of years old.Voice quality seems very good from the calls I've made in my suburban area.  Callers have said they can hear me well, and I can hear them very well.  Texting also seems to work well.  It takes a little getting used to the touch screen keyboard, but after the learning curve I've found I can type fairly rapidly.  I also like the \"conversation\" presentation of your text messages.The camera seems to be what you would expect from a 2.0 megapixel camera, not great, but not that bad either.  The video camera also seems decent enough for internet clips, but I wouldn't use it for archival footage.The music player generally works well, but can be a bit slow.  I have an eight gigabyte micro SD card with around four gigs of mp3s on it.  The music player only seems slow on start up, taking as much as 20 seconds to load the application.  I think this is probably due to the speed of the phone's processor and the amount of music on my card.  It's not an iPod, but it seems to do the job of playing music just fine once the player loads.One caveat about the music player is that it does not support songs downloaded from iTunes.  So any files you've purchased off iTunes will not work on this phone's music player.  I believe the description on Amazon and also on AT&T; said that it could play AAC, but when I've tried to play them on the phone it says it is an \"unsupported file type.\"The phone is fairly small and very light.  It fits easily into your pocket and doesn't take up excessive pocket space.  I don't know how durable the touch screen is.  I've had it for a few weeks and it has a few scratches already.  I'm hesitant to get a protective screen because it might degrade the touch screen sensitivity.For effectively $30 ($80 less $50 airtime credit), you get a good phone with a music player, FM radio, and some good organizer functions.

It's brought me great peace of mind, so I'll give a summary of how the phone has been doing.Call quality has been great for me, although I've read differently for some here.  I'm guessing that it perhaps may be locale and cell signal that is the root issue for call quality.Touch screen has been working well for about 3 months now (Crosses-fingers, knocks on wood).  This was a huge fear of mine since so many has reported a dead screen after only 3 months of use.  It is the reason I waited to review the phone.Apps are decent for pre-teen, early-teen kids and the elderly.  May not be suitable for adults depending on smartphone capabilities needed.  If you check email, use apps regularly and need wifi to browse consider a different phone.  This phone only runs on the antiquated edge network.Accessories are cheap so that you don't break the bank as well.

I put some shows that she likes to watch for entertainment on the bus or she listens to music.

There are Widgets to put on home screen, screen background can be changed, internal camera and video takes decent enough pics and videos for the price.

Yes, when you make or receive a call, the screen locks. However, unlocking the phone is as instantaneous as pressing the lock button on the lower right-hand side of the phone. You DON'T have to \"press and hold\" the on-screen unlock buttonMoreover, the phone HAS to auto-lock because if it didn't, your cheek would press all kinds of keys on the touch screen.So far, everything else on the phone is working great. Bluetooth works flawlessly, and the android OS's text-messaging interface is a real charm -- extremely similar to the iphone text messaging interface.The Prime is quite solid, and doesn't \"creak\" when you press buttons. The headphone jack is a nice inclusion, and the 2.0 megapixel takes great sharp pictures. Sharp enough to be used as a background for my desktop MAC.Overall, I've been quite happy with this phone.

That is to say, my cell phone is not my primary means of communication.  I give the number out to no one.  If I'm going somewhere and want to stay in touch, I forward my home phone to my cell.  Other than that, it is basically an emergency phone. I would not think of leaving the house without it.With that caveat, I am generally pleased with this phone.  The touch screen, while certainly requiring a bit of a learning curve, is easy enough to use.  Voice quality (incoming) is fine, and I've had no complaints about outgoing voice.  In fact, because people have dialed my  home phone and then been forwarded to the cell, they don't actually realize they are talking to me on a cell.  It is small, lightweight and attractive.  Just about everything anyone would want in a cell phone, and at an astonishingly low price.Right?  Well, almost.I've noticed many of the reviewers like almost everything about the phone, with the exception of one function or feature.  That one function or feature seems to vary from person to person.  Such is the case with me.My one complaint:  Voice Activation/Voice Dial.  God have mercy on your soul if this is a feature you are counting on when you buy this phone.  It has, without a doubt, the worst voice recognition system of any voice dial phone I have used, and this is my fourth phone with the voice dial system.  In fact, I'm prepared to say this phone has no voice recognition system at all.  Rather, it seems to have been installed with the most comprehensive voice NON-recognition system ever invented.  I will say a name, in what I believe to be clear, concise English, and will be asked if this is who I wanted.  Almost without fail, it will be the wrong contact.  Usually it is not even close.  When I say \"No\", it will either bring back the same contact (as many as four times) for another go at it, or offer me a new contact, also wrong.  It is almost fiendishly uncanny in its' inaccuracy. There are settings for the voice functions (Sensitivity, etc.) which the owner's manual directs you to, but then says not a word about how to use them.  I've played with them a bit, but found no improvement.  Fortunately, the contact list is so easy to use I have just about given up ever having the use of the voice functions.So, after two months of use, there you have it.  I like the phone.

There are some really great refurbished gophone deals through AT&T; that go from $7 and up, but I was really attached to the larger screen, ease of texting, and software tools of the LG Xenon so I went the route of the LG Prime.Compared to the LG Xenon, this phone really isn't much different.  A quick comparison for those familiar with the Xenon:Cons: lack of physical keyboard, lack of 3G, slightly diminished screen quality (even though it's a tad larger), scaled down home screen (one main screen with widgets instead of 3 dedicated screens for quick contacts, widgets, and applications)Pros: 3.5mm (standard) headphone plug (hooray!), thinner.The texting is just a step below an iPhone - not too difficult, easier than a standard phone (T9) but not as easy as a physical qwerty keyboard.  The tool I personally used most on my Xenon, the notepad (simple, I know), is buried so deep I thought it was missing until I stumbled upon it a couple weeks in.  But I'm glad the tools included in the Xenon are all still right here in the Prime.I don't notice the lack of 3G on phone calls.  I don't use the internet or email but the one big difference I noticed is in MMS/picture messages.  Pictures sent from another phone via text would hit my Xenon within a couple minutes.  On the Prime Edge network it can easily take a half hour or more, on a regular basis.My last complaint on this otherwise great phone is the incredible difficulty in creating new contacts.  Specifically, trying to get from one field to the next.  But once it's done, it's done, and you won't have to deal with it in other applications as you use the phone.Although I listed a few cons, it's really in comparison to LG's Xenon (which, in it's own right, was frustrating for it's lack of a headphone jack), and for the price is truly a great and useful phone.  Texting is much easier than on a standard T9 phone, and the headphone jack is a true blessing when you don't feel like lugging your iPod and your cell phone at the same time for a quick public transit trip.

After accidentally knocking my 2 yr. contract phone off the counter and into the dog's water bowl, I needed to replace it. I tried out and returned a few phones and finally came across this phone. This is my first touch screen phone. It takes getting used to and practice, to learn to scroll. I purchased a 4GB micro sd card with the sd adapter and usb card reader which was less than $20 (there is no need for a usb cable or computer software, your memory card shows up as a removable drive after you click on computer). You gently pop the memory card out of the phone and put it in the usb reader and can download movies, wallpapers, photos and games to the card. I currently have around 8 games, 175 mp3 music files, 30 resized photos, several photo mp4 movies and 10 full length mp4 movies on the card. I still have over 1GB of free space left on my memory card. The phone works well for me, I've have had it for around a year, and it's still working as well as new. The sound quality is loud & crisp. I have never had a problem hearing others or them hearing me. Great signal strength and easy to use menus. You can set the phone to \"lock\" in 1 minute of no use. No problem when on a call, just press the side unlock button every once in a while and it works great, not sure why others found this problematic. The bluetooth pairs up very nicely with garmin gps products, I use it with the garmin 1390-lmt. My favorite things about this phone are the bluetooth, screen size, call clarity, and volume.

Great battery life, voice dialing (I love it) and the sound quality is superb.  Even though my hands aren't very big, dialing and texting were quite easy.  I've read some comments about the weight of the phone and I think it's a perfectly weighted phone. It doesn't feel flimsy at all to me and I really don't like a phone that feels like a brick in my shirt pocket.A couple cons that I do have is:1) Scrolling though lists may take a little practice. Though, with the proper technique it should be a breeze.2) The phone locks during calls.  This feature is good to prevent you from accidentally clicking on something while your cheek is pressed against the touch screen while on a call;  however, if you're making a call to, for example, a customer service number and you have to press numbers to select options in a list, you must unlock your phone to press a number during each option. For me, that's a bit bothersome.Overall, this phone is absolutely a keeper.  Good quality construction, great features at a extremely reasonable price for what you're getting.

In comparison, I've also had several other prepaid phones, and had the iPhone 4 for several weeks before deciding to return it.  This is no iPhone or any smartphone, but it still has pretty good feature list for a prepaid featurephone.  The touchscreen is reasonably responsive (has a resistive rather than a capacitive touchscreen like the iPhone or Android smartphones, so it requires a bit more of a push to register presses).  I'll just mention a few complaints I have with the phone:-The screen scratches very easily.  I scuffed mine up pretty well in the first week by just keeping it in my pocket (not with my keys), so I ended up using a cheap case with it.-The phone locks after only several seconds of no activity, with no option to adjust this.  This is supposed to protect against accidental keypresses while you're making a call, but is annoying when you make a call and are trying to dial an extension or use an automated service, only to have to unlock the phone again.  You can unlock the phone using a button press on the side, but sometimes the phone is slow to respond.-One drawback with the AT&T; Pay as You Go service is that calls sometimes seem to be billed higher than what is supposed to be charged.  I have the phone set to display a balance summary after each call, and sometimes it appears to overbill $.10 for a call.  We're talking about $.10 now and then, but it's still adds some distrust about AT&T;'s billing practices.I'm hoping with the cheaper smartphone hardware coming out that prepaid smartphones will be in the horizon this year, but overall LG Prime works well and is the best touchscreen prepaid phone I've come across so far.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Phone", "Author": "zinger", "ReviewID": "R2GA0GUDRYE3RD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I'm very happy with this phone.

I bought a video over AT&T;'s app store to try it out. I don't have a data plan, and the total cost to browse for a video and download it was over $12 (for a one-minute video)! That's why they are so generous with the $50 air-time credit! The video had terrible resolution, and took several minutes to download. Downloading video was a complete waste of time and money.Having an external micro-SD card slot is great, but again, loading videos to play on it is a bit of work (SD card sold separately). First, you have to convert your WMV or MP4 videos to the 3GP format. This will turn good quality videos into  small thumbnail type videos on your LG Prime, since native 3GP resolution is only 176x144. Viewing in landscape mode enlarges the screen, but makes the video somewhat blotchy and grainy. With the latest RealPlayer (free version), you can download YouTube videos and easily convert them into 3GP format with okay stereo sound. The results are watchable, but far short of my Apple Classic iPod video player (320x240).The MP3 music player has good stereo sound quality, with predefined equalizer settings you can choose. Noticeably lacks Dolby noise reduction, however.The MediaNet web-browser is very limited, and seemed the same as in my old flip-phone, but the larger screen is nice. Landscape mode a plus, but a little harder to navigate. Don't load full HTML sites, the data charges will eat you up! Stick to slimmed down mobile sites. Also, no Wi-Fi for free internet surfing.Best feature to me is the high quality display of picture files, which you can load from your micro-SD card, with a nice zoom function.Separate email app costs $5/month to use, but you can avoid this by accessing email through the web via MediaNet for AT&T;/Yahoo! email accounts, or if your account has mobile web access such as Earthlink's mobile webmail.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Angie", "ReviewID": "R2EMG480TFRVW4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The LG Prime phone is a nice little phone for being prepaid and for being a newer generation of touchscreen.I don't use the mobile web, app center, AT&T; music or play any games on it but as far as functionality on it goes its not that bad.As far as the actual phone function goes, it works great with no issues. I have not experienced any dropped calls as of yet and sadly I live on the bottom floor of an apartment complex that is covered in cement. To top it off I live out in the sticks and my old cellphone would not work out here, so i'm impressed with the fact that I can sit on the couch in my living room and talk on my phone, because with my old service provider I had to go outside in the middle of the parking lot and stand out in the rain in order to hold a conversion (I live in the Pacific Northwest and its...always...raining...24/7)I really like the AM/FM Radio function. The phone takes a standard headphone jack like you would use on your MP3 player. Works pretty good for working out.The other tool include a voice recorder, voice command, Alarm Clock, Calendar, Notepad, Calculator, Tip Converter and Unit Converter.The camera/video is a nice function. The picture output of it looks pretty good if taken outside. Inside pictures don't look that great. Noting too fancy or spectacular.One of the things I struggle with the phone is text messaging. Writing a text message on this phone can be kind of a pain in the butt because the calibration is not 100% accurate.The battery is pretty decent. It keeps a full charge for a couple days.Overall I am happy with my purchase. I would never consider buying insurance for it being that its not worth very much and why pay $15 a month insurance when you have to pay a deductible to obtain a new phone?

After suffering through Virgin Mobile's locked down phones for over 4 years, I am utterly amazed at how versatile the LG Prime is. And the $50 credit (which expires in 90 days) makes this phone only $30 dollars here on Amazon.First of all, you can use a standard Micro USB cable to connect to PC, and attach a standard 3.5mm headphones to listen to music. No adapters needed. You also get FM radio, Bluetooth, an MP3 player, MicroSD reader, etc, etc. I mean it's worth the $30 just for the MP3 player capabilities alone.Second, when you connect this device to your PC, you are able see and copy any data files to the internal memory or the MicroSD card. None of the Virgin Mobile phones I've used in the past gave me this option.You can add Java ME applications with zero hassle. This is a major plus. There are thousands of free Java ME applications on the internet, which you can download using your PC and send them to your phone. For example, to install Opera Mini, you go to their website on your PC, download the full .jar file, and copy it to your MicroSD card (or the phone's internal memory). Next, disconnect the phone from PC, go to main menu, select \"My Stuff\", and finally select \"Memory Card\". You .jar file will be shown. If you tap the file, it will automatically start the installation process (fast and simple). No application restrictions, and that's definitely awesome.Everything else works great too. Screen is responsive. This is a small phone however (smaller that the iPhone). I also have no issues with the screen lock during calls. All you have to do is press the unlock side button and the screen in immediately unlocked.Additionally, AT&T; new rates are 10 cents per minute with no daily access fee (down from the original 25 cents).

I've had Net10, Virgin Mobile, Verizon, and my family has U.S. Cellular. And I can tell you this: AT&T; blows every single one of them out of the water. 4-5 bars everywhere within 30 miles(because that's the furthest I've gone with it yet), fast enough internet for my taste.The LG Prime is a magnificent phone. It dies a way better job at being a camera and an iPod than, well, my camera and iPod. My camera is an 8.2 megapixel, this phone is 2. For being a 2mp camera, it looks very nice. And as far as iPod, I put 550 songs on my microSD card, and this thing loads faster and sounds better than my iPod. And the thing I really like is that I can just plug it into the AUX in my car, and the sound quality far surpasses that of an iPod. And I don't have to mess around with iTunes, nor do I have to convert the files. It plays them right off the microSD, in mp3 format.I'm new to touch screens, but the touch screen on this thing is amazing. Every once in a while, I accidentally hit a wrong key when texting, but that's because I have a bit wider fingers than most. Not a big deal. Another thing I like is just the convenience of it. I'm used to flip phones, and the most I had before this was a Net10 texting phone, and this is so much better. The touch keypad is much, much better.And I also like AT&T;'s plans way better as well. I don;t talk much on the phone almost strictly text, so if I really wanted to I could just do a $30 a month plan, with 20 each month to unlimited text and I'd have 100 minutes every month in case of emergencies or whatever. And if I want unlimited internet, then I'd just have to buy $50 a month. Still cheaper than really any contract.It satisfied all of my needs and much more.

I use a cell for talking and texting 50/50, with an occasional use for random picture taking. For example, in the past two years, I have recently switched from my old reliable samsung sgh-x497 flip to a razr, now looking again since I gave my samsung to my mom, and the razr I bought on craigs started acting up (button not working). Anyway, on to the short 'review'. Keep in mind, I only used it a week.PROS-feels well-built, solid, metallic-FM radio works well, easy to use-gives 'conversation view' for texts, if you like that-good speaker volume for conversations and radio, but low volume during calling someone-picture quality averageCONS-phone slows down while texting, and especially gets troublesome during text conversations with multiple parties. For instance, if u are in the process of typing a text and you get another one, it interrupts you and you have to stop and answer with 'reply' or 'ignore'. I think they should have omitted this. Then if you press 'reply' it auto-saves your message you were typing to drafts. Also, even though it displays the conv thread, you still have to actually click on each message, even tho you can read the whole thing-if you don't, the phone still shows you that you have unread msgs. Annoying.-call quality was just ok-touchscreen sometimes became unresponsive(I also figured out I don't like touchscreens at all)-I didn't like the UI at times, for instance, it has a 'tap-n-drag' type contacts button, which is nice, but you better be careful, because you can easily call the wrong person unless you have (accurate) surgeons hands-many misstypings, even after calibrating touchscreenI am now looking at the Nokia E series phones for long-term, but I bought a used lg cu500 for the time being.Thx", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great emergency or travel option - Great for kids!", "Author": "DuckEE", "ReviewID": "RHIDF5DAS825L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this phone.

It's just easy I suppose.The only problems I'd like to bring up is the tilt screen when texting.  You go from portrait to landscape mode which is fairly annoying.  The conversation mode makes up for it, though.Also, even after checking all of my messages sometimes the message icon still appears.During calls, the screen likes to lock.  A tip; if you need to enter numbers during the call - tap it every few seconds to prevent this from happening.  The reason it locks is so when you're chatting you don't hit buttons with your ear etc.This phone is very app limited, and a few of the pre-installed apps are just trials, but the phone is absolutely worth the money.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not recommend", "Author": "Amit Sahoo", "ReviewID": "R6PCUMC2I4OP0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this a year back, and at that time it was pretty much the only touchscreen you get from AT&T; without having to sign up for a messaging plan. But now, it is not a good idea to buy this phone because:1. It is not very good2. You can get a touchscreen phone from AT&T; without having to sign up for a messaging plan (you will have to sign up for a 1 or 2 year contract though)So, here's the run down for the phone.The good:1. Cheap, sort of2. Light3. Touchscreen4. Decent battery lifeThe bad:1. Voice quality sucks, quite a bit of white noise. This issue is bad enough for me to advise against buying this phone.2. Touchscreen: \"Button press\" works ok, but a drag/flick is cumbersome. Sometimes a scroll-list moves too much an sometime it moves too little. I know it is resistive, but it is just not good.3. Touchscreen: Sometimes even the button presses do not work correctly. I use a calling card to make international calls. And if I have to enter a 10 digit number, I invariably get connected to number different from what I dialed4. No proximity sensor. Phone locks the screen after 2 seconds of starting a call. That is ok if you calling a person. It is big pain if you calling an automated number where you have to listen to options and enter responses.5. Interface and apps are not good. E.g. if you are scrolling the contact list and went to names starting with letter \"M\" and the phone locks because you did not touch it for a while. When you unlock the phone, the phone will not remember that you were at letter \"M\" and will show the beginning of the contact list. Stopwatch does not have a countdown timer.6. Has gone into \"zombie\"  mode a few times. Loses signal and does not get it back. Have to reboot the phone for it to reconnect to the network. Sometime it has been a number of hours before I realize that it has lost signal. Another big fail.To summarize, it might have made sense to buy this phone a year ago.

Overall I would have to say this phone rocks. It is completely full featured and you can even open tabs in the browser.SURPRISES- When I got this phone I thought that I knew everything that it could do but I didn't. When you take a picture you can edit it. Also, there are 2 different keyboards a horizontal and a vertical. The browser is amazing and the social networking app that comes with it is pretty easy to setup and use although do be prepared to shell out some cash for your internet usage so I would suggest using a data package.ITS BETTER ONCE YOU TRY- The entire widgets thing confused me at first I didn't get why you would want to cover up your screen with these things, but then I soon realized how amazing they are. You can pull up a calender have music playing, or even have a slide show going all at once!WOW WHY DO I NEED THIS???OH YEAH ITS COOL- The radio is one of those cool features no one needs but it so cool to have. I will admit reception is not the best...but who cares it usually fulfills its purpose. Also, in the messaging there are signatures you can type up and put in and I thought oh who needs this but its a neat way to share funny quotes with everyone you text or put in a good saying you have or even your mood.So overall this phone is good, but there are a few little \"bugs.\" One would have to be the radio, yes I said its good but its reception is spotty at best. Also, the browser is faster than most gophones but it still is painfully slow so just be ready and the more tabs you have open the worse. Also, this phone can freeze, it may unfreeze after a second or two but it does like its thinking time and that can get a little annoying. Also, the screen lock is very nice to have but instead of holding onto the screen I would suggest just pressing the lock button on the side because it is just so much easier. And do beware than even if the screen goes off it does NOT mean its locked so just make sure you press the lock button or go into the settings and make it lock after 5 or 15 seconds to be safe. One last little gripe I have is those pesky little buttons. They are gonna take some getting used to. I have become a bit better over the 24 hours but still they are not the easiest to work with and u are a slow texter this maybe for you because the phone occasionally takes a second to type.

To install games you can just plug the phone up to your computer and transfer downloaded games on to the phone's memory(you might want to get a cheap micro SD card) and then you just navigate to /my stuff/ other files in the phone's menu and select the game. Then if it is compatible, the phone will install it.

I basically only use my cellphone to make a few calls and occasionally receive a text so I finally got a clue and wised up about canceling my monthly service with AT&T; since my contract has been up for over a year now. I was first going to upgrade my phone and sign a new contract, but realized I can potentially save $300-350 a year by choosing GoPhones instead and finding $100 prepaid cards that are good for 1 entire year. One card may be all I need right now on the 10 cents a min plan. I was looking for a new phone with touchscreen that will also double as an mp3 player and video player. This is the perfect phone to transition from a regular phone to a touchscreen phone as it is very simple to use. It also has an FM radio which is a huge bonus. And it uses a regular headphone jack which is another big bonus. I had to use a converter for my old LG Shine and it started malfunctioning very early on. I love the touchscreen keyboard for entering #s and typing texts. I was at first frustrated by how the screen locks so quickly while I was trying to set up my voicemail. I was pressing the screen to unlock it and ended up somehow trying to dial voicemail while on a call with voicemail already so I had to end the call. This happened twice before I started using the unlock button on the side of the phone and found it very easy to use to keep unlocking the screen so I could key in the correct #s for the voicemail. I like that on the 10 cents plan, I can still receive text messages and get charged 20 cents for each message without having to sign up for a $5 or $10 monthly add-on texting plan. I also like that my phone can't seem to connect to the internet since I don't have an add-on monthly data plan. I will not be using the internet on this phone and don't want the charges from accidentally using the internet. I do not like that videos I play don't fill up the entire screen. There are two black bands on the side that results in smaller videos. I do not like that I have to press the menu button to change a video to landscape mode and the video automatically pauses and I need to make it play again. In short, this isn't the best phone for use as a video player, but that's not of extreme importance. I just want to watch videos while I wait for appointments. I found some free games I put onto my phone but probably won't be playing them unless I find one I love. I bought a mirror screen protector and a retractable car charger on Amazon and I also found some great Coach case covers on eBay. I really like this phone a lot so far.

I had a few months of decent operation from the device.  I've read many reviews and I share some of the problems people have in the most negative aspect and I also share some of the positives.When the phone works its great but this isn't acceptable for a phone to not operate properly all of the time.  I have the touchscreen problem where the screen shifts and after some desperate measures I found the screen can sometimes be remedied by BENDING the phone a little.  I wouldn't recommend bending your phone but when you need your touchscreen to work you do what you must.  The first time I had a problem with the touchscreen was when I once left it in my car overnight and thought the cold ruined the screen.  The screen eventually operated properly after some frantic bending.  Then after another instance of touchscreen malfunction I thought it was because I had the phone in a cell phone pocket on the side of my leg causing the phone to get torqued slightly, which could still be the case, and I again bent the phone to make it work.  After that I started carrying the phone in a holster that I put inside a bag that pretty much keeps most if not all physical strains away from the phone while I am at work where I do some bending, walking around and getting in and out of trucks often.I also had the texting problem where the recipient did not receive texts.  I didn't bother getting to the bottom of that problem to see if its the carrier like some have suggested or the phone.  However I never had a problem with signal strength or dropped calls.Using the internet on the LG Prime was sort of laughable waiting for pages to load.  Ultimately I just I only paid for one month of a data plan to download some games and that was it.  The new AT&T; data plans are a better deal now and might not be so bad to carry over but you really wouldn't use it much on the LG Prime.I am not bothering to get a warranty replacement because I have read all of the negative complaints with the same problems afterward.  I thought I was just too rough on a delicate phone but if the same problems are happening to people who aren't putting the small stresses I have put on the phone.I think the LG Prime is just an inferior product OR it is exactly what you pay for; a pay as you go pseudo-smart phone that gives you the functionality of a touchscreen when it happens to work.I am buying the LG Thrive and I hope that it is a little sturdier in respect to the touchscreen.

It was a mistake to buy them. They all have similar problems. Let's start with the worst one. My phone locks up without any indication other than it won't receive any calls and won't let me place any. It attempts to call, and never connects. It happens a few times a month. My kids' phones are not immune to this bug either but they lock up less frequently. Whether I turn it off during the night, or leave it on all the time it will eventually stop working. The cure: remove and reinsert its battery.Secondly none of the three phones I ordered had operational dial pad during calls. That means setting up voice mail was impossible, same goes for selecting options while on a call. Luckily \"Master Reset\" feature suggested by LG support solved that issue. Locking up though remains.LG support suggested sending the unit back to them, since it's on warranty. There doesn't seem to be any firmware update available (current one is from April 2010).Save yourself frustrations of operating this cell phone. Even if it worked as advertised, its unresponsive touch screen, and automatic menu access blocking would make for a poor experience.It's not even good as an emergency cell phone, because it locks itself up. Callers are redirected to a voice mail immediately... I can't imagine using it on daily basis and depending on it.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG PRIME GO PHONE", "Author": "Elizabeth T.

The user interface is pretty basic, and easy to use. When first calibrating the touch screen it took a while to figure out the level of \"touch\" required for the phone to register what I was doing. Though since that, it hasn't given me much trouble. For texting, you have the option of either the standard keypad, or a full keyboard. (switching between the two is just a matter of a single tap) The touch screen is pretty sensitive to scratching, so I would recommend a screen shield or having a protective case of some kind when carrying it around.  The phone clarity is great, and the speaker is more that sufficient in volume. An \"okay\" amount of options are available right away, but most need to be purchased from the online store, either from the phone, or your computer. (i.e. apps, ringtones, games, etc...) I was disappointed that you can't use your own music as ringtones, like I have done with previous phones (unless the file size in very small, and by very small I mean only a few k) Overall I am happy with the phone, and the service.

The phone itself is a somewhat more advance smart phone (offering more applications, more connectivity) at a much lower price (I paid less than half of what this is now selling for from a marketplace seller.)  When I recommended this, I was comparing it to an LG LG 620G Prepaid Phone (Net10) net10.  The phone was \"OK,\" the service just awful.  Bothe the service on At&T; and the phone are better than what I was using, but neither is as good or cost effective as what I am now using.  We have moved our entire family over, my parents are now in the process of replaing theirs as well.  I still think this is a pretty good phone and the service and connectivity is good as well.  It is just that both will cost substantially more, for less (minutes, options) than what I am getting with my new phone and service.  What At&T; is charging is pretty much standard rates for a pre-paid phone (which was a surprise to mer than I hae found better and less expensive (on the order of 5-10 fold) with what I am using now.My old review appears below.________________________________________________________________________________Now that the description has been edited to provide a more accurate description of the current rate pl;an, and we have lived with this for a while, I can do a better review of the phone itself.We had a bit of a run-in recently with one of the major carriers, who charged us $200 for our \"free\" time (mobile to mobile, nights & weekend) when my daughter went 1 minute over the included \"prime\" minutes.  So, after more than 10 years of overpaying for shoddy service, I quit and decided to get some pay as you go phones while we decide which phones/ plans are right for us. My daughter is in college and uses her cell as her primary phone, hence needing it more than the rest of us.  For her I got a touch screen on virgin mobile (that cost $150).  I went with them for the lower cost comprehensive plans.  My son barely ever used his phone, so I got him one of these thinking the $50 credit would last him a year. *NOTE* The included $50 is only good for 2 months....so this turned out to be a bit more expensive than I had thought.  BUT, the phone itself is pretty great....I bought an LG 610 for myself (net10) thinking it would get me the service I needed at a very low cost.  the phone is decent, but does not have many features, *and* I will note that the plan is almost the same as at&t;'s.My son's phone (this model) is so so much better, and at a lower cost, that I bought another for my husband....and now, I have phone envy.If I could return my $40 phone, I would, and would trade it in for one of these.  Not only does it have a large bright touch screen, but it has features found on many of the higher end models: a camera, a calendar and date book, mp3 player, note taking feature.I have looked at just about every pre-paid phone on the market and this beats just about all of them at a fraction of the price.  In fact, now that I see that you can get a bigger card which holds the minutes longer (and at a lower cost/ month) I may side-line my phone and buy another one of these for myself!I will add, for those of you who have one, or are thinking of purchasing one, that it does not come with a case.  The Lowespro case I reviewed elsewhere fits this camera nicely (and I have tagged to make it easy to find)", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "L", "ReviewID": "R2LWCSTHLCUXYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love this phone my mom got me the phone today i love it and you get 150 free ?", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's a good phone,but...", "Author": "Ms. Cassanova Jones", "ReviewID": "R18G5G6EOBA7VT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about a month and a half now and the only problem I have is it freezes up REALLY bad and the touchscreen is often slow or has a delayed reaction...

That is primarily due to the touch screen being awful. It took 15 minutes to get through the calibration process because the phone simply refused to accept my touch inputs 90% of the time. (At one point, I counted and my touch input was accepted only after 19 attempts.) The touch scrolling through menus is hit or miss at best. Some areas within the phone's menus work well with it, but others do not. And some are like the calibration process--try as you may, the screen either doesn't scroll/move or you open a menu you didn't intend to open. And I don't think that's a freeze issue, but simply a poorly made product.If you absolutely must have a touch screen phone to appear cool to others, buy it. However, if you want a phone which simply works and allows you to do what you want quickly, don't even think about buying an LG Prime--unless you're primed for frustration. After 6 hours of frustrating usage, this product is being returned. (You can now make that *has* been returned, and within 18 hours of its receipt.)Addendum: Let me identify other problems I had with this phone. If you miss a call, the locked screen displays a message about the missed call. However, until you unlock the phone, you cannot simply remove that information from the screen. And then given the touch screen doesn't work worth a hoot, I spent 5 minutes getting the touch screen to finally recognize my taps and so I could verify having seen the missed call information. Even worse, as long as the missed call information is displayed on the essentially non-functional touch screen, you cannot unlock the phone with the button on the side. You can't unlock the phone until you unlock the phone's screen, and unlocking the screen is practically impossible. \"Quite a catch, that catch-22.\"As for texting, I finally gave up on getting a single text even written. The touch screen would pick up the wrong alphabet or number at least one-third of the time, if not more. To add to the frustration, I wanted to send the text to someone not in my address book so needed to add the contact. That proved impossible. Although I entered a name (in text only) in the correct field, the phone invariably returned error messages about needing to enter only letters or numerals. Given that, so much for ever at any time entering this person's unique actual name which has a hyphen in it. And editing the already entered text seemed to be one of the last considerations given by the phone's designers, except for......being able to do pretty much anything with all contacts by selecting them all at once, excluding deleting them all in one fell swoop. I was returning the phone and needed to remove my personal information, which meant removing the 100+ contacts I'd transferred to it. (Was this purposeful design as not to make deletion of them all an easy error? No way given the menu is significantly buried and a person would have to go far out of their way with several inputs to make such a \"mistake.\") As for the master reset, a call to ATT was of no help because the phone was so new that the service person to whom I was speaking could not tell me the master reset code. (True or not? I don't know and now don't care or need to know.) Between those two inconveniences, it took almost an hour to tediously delete each contact individually.When attempting to input certain information, the phone displays only one of several needed input lines at a time. Additional lines below are covered by the screen's keyboard. Again because of extreme touch screen deficiencies, after entering the first line of information and then needing to navigate to the the second line which was hidden by the virtual keypad, I could not get it to scroll to the additional lines below the one already showing.In sum, this was the very worst phone I've ever had. Clearly it was given insufficient design considerations--almost to the point of thinking no one at LG attempted to actually use the phone as a customer might before placing it on the market. So again, unless you wish to look cool having a touch screen phone and don't care whether it works or not, *DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE*!", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bad for a touchscreen", "Author": "liveforknowledge", "ReviewID": "R3QPRTC91U5UHQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The touchscreen is to small to use.
