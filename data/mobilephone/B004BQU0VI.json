{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent paperweight", "Author": "DRM \"Dave in GA\"", "ReviewID": "R1P7AW8CEFNY9I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst electronic device I have ever owned (and I'm 57). It is slow...very slow. But it is Windows based, so that is probably average for that operating system. A typical scenario is: touch an icon; wait; wait some more; then something happens. It may not be what you wanted, but something will eventually happen. It is a phone, but when receiving a call, you must proceed very slowly or it will simply drop your call; and I don't think it is Verizon's drop. Others seem to have no problem getting a signal, answering a call, emailing etc. With this phone, each of those functions is a crap-shoot every time. If you are an urban-dweller with constant strong signals, the battery should last as you would expect, but if you venture to an area with a weak signal, expect the battery to last about as long as Rush Limbaugh at a Democratic fund raiser. Internationally, I only use the texting option, which works OK. But be careful, you cannot dis-able all data connections, so in foreign countries you will continue to run up some data charges. It does have no problem displaying error messages. I receive several per day, usually telling me that I cannot receive emails. Then I find all my emails in the inbox. Sorting through them is not very elegant, however. Transferring data to a computer can only be compared to herding cats. Bottom line: Don't buy this phone.All things considered, however, it does make an excellent paperweight.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for a while", "Author": "A. A.

It was absolutely superb in all respects. Everything worked. It only slowed when I overloaded it with apps. when I took them out, it went back to being OK again. then one day, about 2 months ago, it just stopped. I have 4 batteries and tried them all. Not even a flicker.It is an old phone and it lasted as long as it was supposed to, I guess. Get a newer phone. Get Androoid. The Win OS has lots of issues and although I love my Win OS on my computer, if you gave me a phone with Win on it, I would refuse it. I say again ANDROID is the way to go. My HTC with Android 2.2 runs flawlessly.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excelent Phone, not for newbies", "Author": "Leonardo Cabrera", "ReviewID": "R62QVQMCFYQ6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello,Firts thing First, This seller is a serious seller, shipped on time, arrived in excellent conditions and fast.The phone is an excellent phone but you got to KNOW HOW TO USE IT PROPERLY, I think you have to be an excellent WM user to squeeze the juice out of it, otherwise dont get this phone. (Pay for being a smartphone newbie and get a iphone).Since I wanted to add other features I installed other ROM versions and worked excellent.Only down side is that is the T-Mobile version, (It does not correspond to the photograph), but I knew this could happen, however, I think it's a fair trade for the price.I used to own an HTC Tytn II (Nice phone too), but this one is far more powerfull, and battery lasts easily two days. (That's Right two straight days, scanning my two email accounts every 5 minutes).Call quality is OK, no unusual call drops. (My service provider sucks).Would definitelly buy again this product, and also from this seller.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Grandpa", "ReviewID": "ROCQVEAYNJJ7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey, I'm 65 and love the phone.  Yeah, it's windows based, but it's exactly what I need.  It is not slow by any means; it uses the Qualcom 528 MHz processor.  It compares very favorably with the iPhone 3G in terms of speed ... that comes as a result of a side-by-side comparison when my nephew scoffed at anything not Apple.I use it with a prepaid T-Mobile account and do not have a data plan. I'm an occasional cell-phone user, so I only pay $8.33 per month for my cell phone connection (That's comes to $100 per year and 1000 minutes per year).  I browse the internet regularly when I travel, using the WiFi capability.  I travel a lot and its excellent for that use -- I no longer lug my laptop with me on trips.  I also have CoPilot GPS software installed and use it the software is more versatile.  I find I use the 3.4 megapixel camera quite frequently ... the phone takes excellent photographs, even in low light.  The screen is very nice, and the phone is quite rugged -- I have dropped it enough times to know!I have an ample number of apps loaded ... all I need are available.  Many of the \"latest and greatest\" apps are not available, so if that's your need, buy an Android or iPhone.  You can install Android on the HTC Touch Pro 2, but I have not felt the need to do that.  Otherwise, this phone works quite nicely.A few \"did I mentions\":I'm a retired software and systems professional.I have an 8 gig memory card installed so don't have too many limitsIt has better reception (by about a bar) than my wife's Motorola flip phone.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Knowing is half the batttle", "Author": "K W", "ReviewID": "R1LM41WDPKZXJK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone was ok, quick shipment to me.  I am ok with the whole thing except that with this phone being a sprint phone I can't use it with my GSM network.  Maybe that should have been noted in the ad.

I'd rather have the old Motorola Brick phone. This phone is slow and the internet is even slower. You have to be real careful what type of case you get for it. Many cases have magnets in them and by just sliding the phone in mose cases will turn it on. Since it is touch sensitive with anything. Normal movement in your day to day activities will make the phone turn on and so amny times I have accidentally called someone and didn't even know it. The battery life is dismal at the best. I rarely last a full day on a sngle charge and have had to purchase 2 extra batteries so i can get theough my work day.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "I think that its a great phone", "Author": "Satisfied", "ReviewID": "R25UIMDVPGJN1C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I got this phone much earlier than expected and I love everything about it, The only problem I had is that it was not unlocked for use with sim cards, being as Verizon uses CDMA instead of GSM but it is easy to unlock for GSM use inside the states if you have 10 dollars and an internet connection, I used [...] if i recall the adress right, but its something along those lines and you go there give them 10 dollars and then they will shoot you an email and if you follow the directions you will end up with an unlock code and you can use you AT&T; sim card im assuming it works with T-mobile as well or if you have sprint or verizon just activate it and your sitting pretty", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "3+ Megapixel Camera, A2DP, Bluetooth, Calendar, Camera\nEdge, Email Client, GPS / Location, High-Speed Data GPRS\nMemory Card Slot, MP3, Qwerty Keyboard, Smartphone, Speaker Phone, Touch Screen, Video Capture, Video Clip, Wi-Fi\nWindows Mobile for Smartphones\n3G EURO Standard, Quad Band 850/900/1800/1900", "Name": "HTC Touch Pro 2 - Smartphone - 3G - WCDMA (UMTS) / GSM - touch / slide-out keyboard - Windows Mobile", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31WVg1wXo0L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004BQU0VI"}}
