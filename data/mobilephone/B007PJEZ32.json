Like it better than the Blackberry Bold 9900/9930 (coz it doesn't have android on it). Anyways the packaging was perfect and was brand new and sealed and everything. Superb performance if u know how to use it well. Battery performance is mind blowing. Last for like 2 days with normal average use. This phone has 4GB internal memory but most of is used up by the stock ROM so u will only see about 1.21/1.23 GB available internal memory but space doesn't matter coz I also bought a Sandisk 32GB UHS v1.0 Micro SDHC. :-) There is no lag in this mobile and everything is pretty smooth. Super fast shipping.Note:- There are two models -- International and Canadian. Only the Canadian version has (4G) !!! The international one is exactly the same but doesn't support (4G). This one is international version. So don't expect (4G).This phone is unlocked and I am using T-Mobile.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Misleading write up, mediocre performance", "Author": "Multifox", "ReviewID": "R3JSD3CFCYYJG3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all I will say that this has been the most difficult buying experience I have ever had. The first phone arrived used, covered in finger prints and with a sim card installed. Amazon quickly replaced it, however the second phone also arrived used. Though at least the second one still had everything wrapped up in plastic so it looked new, but the phone already had apps downloaded onto it and a profile on it. Amazon, to my amazement refused to send a third replacement, instead offered me a whopping 10% off. I was told a CS supervisor would call me, but none have...so I am stuck with a used phone.Secondly, this phone is not 4G nor does it have 4G abilities, contrary to Amazons write up. No where in the phones data or networking settings is there anything for 4G. Edge and 3G yes, but not 4G. No where in the PDF users manual does the manufacturer claim it to have 4G abilities either, an email to Motorola confirmed this. Amazon lists the battery as 1600 mAh battery, however it comes with a 1550 mAh battery...and in case you are wondering since they mention nothing about carrier...this works with AT&T; and T-Mobile.Finally on to the phone itself. Reception quality is poor, where my old phone gets a full signal, this phone is lucky to get two bars, despite the fact that I am in a great reception area. The phones signal is greatly affected by holding it, I would strongly suggest getting a Bluetooth headset for this if you want a decent signal. The call quality (when working) is however fantastic, even on speaker phone people on the other end say I sound like I am on a land line. The incoming voice quality is clear and loud both on or off speakerphone. Android is, well android...there is not much to be said about that other than this phone has seven home screens as opposed to the five that most Android phones have. Performance is ok, but this is certainly not a multi-tasking phone as it tends to hang and bog down if you start jumping between email, text messaging and any other apps you are running. Battery life also isn't the best. After only four hours of text messaging the battery is done. My previous Nokia with a 1200 mAh battery could go three days on text messaging alone. Talk time on 2G (Edge) will get you around 5 hours of talk time. Talk time on 3G however will net you around 3 hours of talk time. The keyboard (once you get used to the weird angle of the keys) is nice and firm and easy to use. The Android touch keyboard only works in landscape mode and is a bit of a pain to use. I downloaded a keyboard app that replaces the stock android one and also gives you the option of using it in portrait mode as well, life is good.There are not a lot of aftermarket accessories for this phone, you really have to hunt and peck around the web to find cases or other accessories, so keep that in mind. No Otterboxes or other protective cases specifically for this phone that I've found so far, only one company makes an extended battery and it costs nearly half the price of the phone.Bottom line, this is a very basic entry level smart phone...but make sure when your phone arrives that it is not used like both of mine were.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Android phone with Blackberry keyboard - Its a keeper!", "Author": "Keith Ho \"Amazon Shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R3T3F7QWPWUVTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was so excited to see this unlocked phone available on Amazon.  I have T-Mobile.  I always wanted the Blackberry style physical keyboard on an Android phone.Pros:-  The call quality is excellent.  People think I'm on a landline. The phone comes with a dual microphone, one on top and one on bottom.-  Earpiece and speaker is loud and clear.-  No Android stutter when scrolling between screens.-  Yes, there is a blinking LED light indicator on the top right corner.-  The 5MP rear camera is Autofocus.  It takes decent pictures and 720P videos for a camera phone. Not great in low light.  It has 1 LED flash, not dual flash.-  The battery capacity is 1550 mAh.  I've owned several Android phones in the past and with heavy usage it lasts 6 hours.  The battery life on this Motorola Pro is excellent.  I talk using the speakerphone only.  With 15 hours of usage, the battery indicator is at 55%.  There is also a battery saver mode for additional battery savings.-  The screen is 640x480.  The screen is sharp and bright.  I can read text outdoors without a problem.  The viewing angle is OK.  The screen is a durable gorilla glass.-  Keyboard, this is the reason I bought the Android phone.  I cannot type on a virtual keyboard.  The keyboard is identical to a Blackberry and I love it.-  Multi-media. Plays Youtube.  Music player works with bluetooth headset.-  The phone feels good in the hand.  Good balance.  Heavier on the top than the bottom which is good for typing.Cons:-  No front facing camera.-  GPS is horrible.  It cannot pinpoint my location.  Instead, I use the celltower to try to identify my location.-  The standard Android web browser is awful.  Instead, I downloaded Opera Mini.  However, the screen is only 3.1\" so its difficult to read articles.Bottom Line:  The best business phone I have ever owned.Update 11/22/12:  Here's my feedback after 6 months of usage:Pros:  The battery lasts 2 days.  Because I have no 3G on T-Mobile.  Very durable.  I've dropped this phone on pavements, linoleum, tile and in water.  Still working, no cracks.Cons:  3G does NOT work on T-mobile.  The keyboard is very stiff unlike a Blackberry.  The GPS does NOT work anywhere. Sometimes people can't hear me on the speakerphone when I hold it close to speak.Would I buy this phone again? Yes and No.  I'm thinking of upgrading to Samsung S3 because of the camera quality.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "*** nearly a great phone, but... ***", "Author": "sportcross99", "ReviewID": "R344YQ9JDETSB3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "HERE IS THE REVIEW HAVING FIRST RECEIVED THE PHONE. READ BELOW FOR FOLLOW-UP REVIEW.Sparing you a lengthy review. Here it is. This phone is amazing.* Fast, smooth operating system* Professional image business phone* physical QWERTY keyboard, a little stiff but only had the phone for 1 day* bar style, no annoying horizontal slider* clear, sharp screen* good battery life* light weight* feels great in the hand* many other good qualities* & all of the obvious Android advantages, apps, customizationDid I mention, also.....this phone is outstanding. Five-and-a-half stars.UPDATE!!!After a few days of use, a problem developed with incoming phone calls and reception in general. Whenever I received a call, I could hear the caller (usually) speaking but they could not hear me for at least 5 - 10 seconds. Incredibly annoying! Outgoing calls, however, the caller could usually hear me right away as it should be. But the more the phone was used, the more problematic this became.I figured it must be a problem with the particular phone that I had and send for a replacement. Incredible ease, response time, and even refunded my shipping costs - good on you Amazon.In any case it isn't about the shipping, it's about the phone. Same thing. At first the phone did not have this problem, and now after a few days of use the problem has started again with the replacement phone. It's making an otherwise pretty great phone...pretty unusable. Aside from that there are other reception problems where in my previous phone, with the same SIM card and same carrier, there were none. It takes people 2 or 3 attempts to even ring through on the phone at all.Very disappointing, will probably return it and find something else.

Overall it's a nice looking hardware qwerty candy-bar phone for business people. Battery life is excellent for an Android phone, last about two days with moderate use using max power save mode. The keyboard is too stiff and hard for my taste and the screen size is good. I end up returning it mainly because I wanted something with a softer keyboard like HTC Tilt 2. I will confirm that I got a version that was compatible with at&t; 3G+ network HSDPA 850, 1900 and 2100, which is similar to the Canadian version of this phone and not the international version. If you have at&t; or plan to use it with at&t;, it will work with 3G+ speed which is very fast, almost same as surfing the web using iPhone 4S on 3G+.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone, even with 2G only", "Author": "KT", "ReviewID": "R3RMOXH9FOKXM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, a word of warning: if, like me, you're on T-Mobile and looking to escape the pitiful line of phones they offer, be warned - this phone will not give you 3G on the T-Mobile network. If you can make your peace with being stuck with 2G/Edge pretty much for the lifetime of this phone, read on.The phone itself is quite good - the interface is snappy, and it lacks the \"Android lag\" that came on older Android phones. The software version it ships with is 2.3.5 (Gingerbread), which seems to rule out Swype (if you're looking for that). Other than that, the physical keyboard (a big reason for getting this phone) is quite clicky, although you do have to put some effort in to push the keys. The haptic buttons (the standard Android four button panel) sometimes get pushed when you're using the top row of the physical QWERTY keyboard, so that is a mild irritant.The voice quality is pretty good; the speaker phone, however, is brilliant. This might just be one of the best speaker phones I've ever used. If you need a phone for conferences / meetings, this would be a pretty good bet (and it looks pretty business-like, too!).(Review will be updated based on experience with the phone)", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "This for is for At&T;???", "Author": "Rafa", "ReviewID": "R3QCOIXMUQY79P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I dont fine in any place what is the frequency for 3G this phone has several version.HSDPA 850 / 1900 / 2100HSDPA 850 / 1700 / 2100HSDPA 900 / 2100Can some one help me and tell me what the the HSDPA for this one selling here??", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "First mobile phone I've had in years that I like.", "Author": "Gary W.

I've always had great luck with Motorola and this is no exception.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Phone Ever", "Author": "Whit", "ReviewID": "R190PZJLWBU9CS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone several days ago and by far, this is probably the best phone I have had. I always liked the design and form factor of the Blackberry 7100 series, it being my first smart phone I ever owned. I have owned several since then, including full touch screen Android devices, Windows Phones, and side-slider Android and Symbian devices. Honestly for what I was looking for, this is a great phone. I text and email quite a bit and I absolutely hate on-screen keyboards. The keys are a little stiff and take some time to get acclimated, but work great for what I need it to do. I use my phone on the 850/1900/2100 bands with AT&T; and it works great, getting an even better signal than the other phones I have owned. It also has very snappy performance and is not loaded down with any bloatware from any carrier. If you are looking for a candybar form phone with a qwerty keyboard, this is hands-down the best you can find that has been recently released.UPDATE:I used the phone for roughly two weeks and absolutely loved it. However, I started having problems close to the end of the second week. The ALT key stopped working intermittently, so sometimes I would have no way to input numbers or symbols other than using the on-screen keyboard, which defeats the purpose of having a physical keyboard. Also, the 3G would randomly go out for no apparent reason, even when there definitely was a 3G signal. I would have to turn the phone off and turn it back on and hope that it would pick up the 3G. I had high hopes for this phone and was very excited to have finally found a phone that I had been looking for, but was quickly let down. I returned it for a refund.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely loved it...AT FIRST!", "Author": "Shaina", "ReviewID": "R2Y4A4O5W3GPXA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE: apprx. 6 monthsThis phone was only $200 when I bought it. And at that price, I would NOT say it's a 4 or 5 star phone.  I can't believe it's up to $300 now!  Given the more expensive price, I would have to drop the quality down to 3 stars.  Now that it has apps and updates, it gets pretty laggy while processing. MOST IMPORTANTLY, more often than not when I answer calls nobody can hear.  At it's worst I would say 9 out of 10 people that call me can't hear me for SEVERAL seconds (between 5 to 10) or at all.  On a good week, I'll receive a proper incoming phone call that I can answer with no problems maybe 3 out of every 5 calls. I don't think this is acceptable for a PHONE!  A $300 phone at that.UPDATE: 3 monthsThe phone is a little glitchy.  I've had it for about a month now.  The two problems I've noticed is that the phone screen locks itself whenever the processor can't keep up(ex. playing games), and most annoying for me is that quite often when I pick up an incoming call it will either take a few seconds to connect or the other person just can't hear me at all and they hang up.  This last problem is the reason I knocked my rating down to 4 stars.  Still a pretty great phone and I love the texting, but it's really annoying to be expecting an important phone call and not know whether or not your phone is going to recognize/connect your voice with the caller.ORIGINAL:This phone is definitely worth the money! Relatively inexpensive for the quality. I use straight talk, which just recently started allowing customers to bring their own phone over if it is GSM. I absolutely hated the texting on the tiny touch screen phone I purchased through them. I love having the QWERTY physical keyboard, but the keys are pretty stiff. Given that it is a tight (yet comfortably sized) keyboard I know that it's probably necessary to make the keys a little stiffer or harder to press in order keep you from pressing other nearby keys.I've had the phone for 3 days. It gets faster data connection than the Samsung precedent I was using at 3G speeds.  I haven't had the phone crash on me like some reviews I read, but the screen has randomly locked on it's own as if i pressed the top lock key while working on it. I think mostly after I've been on it a while. My last little (insignificant) complaint is a lack of a physical camera button. Makes taking a pic of yourself nearly impossible. LolOtherwise, there are lots of fun features. The screen is plenty large, great resolution, smooth processing, no problems with my straight talk service, texting and typing is soooo much easier with the physical key board, very business oriented with the apps provided by the phone, lightweight, not too large or small perfect size, call quality seemed great, battery life not to shabby for a Droid OS. For the small price tag and other phones available in its price range, definitely worth every penny!", "Date": "July 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "MB632 also known as PRO+", "Author": "Drew Donald Lenhart \"DLenhart\"", "ReviewID": "RWJ0SCS9R4U9W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received the phone in the mail a couple days ago and couldn't hold my excitement.  Upon opening the package I noticed the phone was insanely light!  The screen was bigger that expected, which is a plus for me.  I compared the phone to an iphone 4, and it is slightly bigger to put in your pocket.  Just a slight downfall, but I wanted a larger screen.The keyboard does take a little bit getting used to.  The keys are slightly arched, beginning down the center, they either arch slightly to the left, and to the right for presumably better typing.  It does take a bit to get used to.The clarity of this screen is what surprises me the most.  According to gsmarena.com, the MB632 has a 640 x 480 pixel display, with ~258 ppi pixel density.  VERY clear!The performance of the phone is superb.  It has a 1GHZ processor with 512mb of ram.  Sometimes there is a slight pause when loading certain applications.The phone also has a 5MP camera, very clear.All in all I would give this phone a 4/5 stars.  The reason I wouldn't give it a 5/5 is that this phone cannot be upgraded to Android Ice Cream sandwitch, so it is stuck at the latest Ginger Bread verson.Great buy and I am really happy with it.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worst  motorolla phone", "Author": "Franklin Morales", "ReviewID": "R7Y41O75560R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It worked  for a month until it froze on motorolla logo.

I researched it for a couple days prior to finally buying it on Amazon. I'm a sucker for physical keyboards but I love Android too much to switch to Blackberry. This phone was practically perfection. The keys were somewhat stiff, but I naturally press hard when I write and type so it wasn't a problem for me. It had a sensor that would lock the display whenever you placed the phone into your pocket, which got in the way sometimes when I dragged down the notification bar due to its location on the top-right-front corner of the phone. I thought it was cool otherwise though. The phone is really fast; if it's ever slow it's probably your data connection. It never froze when I was just messing with the phone without the use of data. Texting was a dream compared to my previous phone (the Motorola Spice XT300 - PS never get that phone. It's slow and very limited due to age). Call quality was good. The vibration on the phone is pretty weak. It has a notification LED light in the top right corner, in case you fancy those the way I do. Now to why I returned the phone to Amazon.. after about five days, I stopped receiving signal, and it would not connect to T-Mobile after working perfectly for those past five days. I could not make calls, be called, send or receive texts or pursue anything involving the use of data. The phone stayed in Emergency mode. I went to T-Mobile to see what they could do about it. They switched my SIM into another phone, the SIM worked fine so it was the phone. After switching SIMS back, I got 4/5 bars of service on the MB632 and was ecstatic. I left the store and tried to call a friend, but the call never went through and the phone immediately went back to emergency mode. Every representative in the T-Mobile store tried to work with it to no avail. I just dropped it off at UPS for an exchange, but I think I'll return the exchanged phone cause I ran into online forums of several people with the same problem on the phone. I really hope that particular phone I had was defective and not all of them are like that cause I thought this phone was great. But at $200 and with others having this problem, I will have to return it and get another phone.

This phone does the trick! Sure, the viewing screen isn't as large as other smartphones, but for quick information look-up on the Internet and email retrieval, this definitely does the trick. Also, the Android Marketplace provides a lot of app options. A cool app to download is Data Enabler, which is a widget that enables or disables your data every time you have access to data, which is helpful for those who don't have a large data plan like me. Another app I found to be important is Headset Blocker...for some reason, the music player on the phone kept randomly stopping every time I plugged it in my auxiliary input in my car. The Headset Blocker app blocks some \"communication in the wire\" so that the phone doesn't think it's a headset.I'm a very fast texter on the BlackBerry, so I was a little frustrated when I had to type on this phone for the first couple of days. Not only were the keys harder to press on this phone that the BlackBerry, but I kept accidentally hitting the four touch screen buttons which would either bring me to my home screen or to the search toolbar. It took me a couple of weeks to learn to not hit those buttons, and to reach my previous texting speed.Very cool phone. Love having the qwerty right there. I don't have to slide out a keyboard nor have to wait for the screen to respond and show a touch screen qwerty.
