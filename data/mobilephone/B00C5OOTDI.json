As with any 3G Verizon phone, the Trophy works well on Page Plus.Mine is a seller refurb.The best thing about this phone is the Windows operating system. It is still supported and works very well on the internet.Here are some more strong-points for the Trophy:+ It's wi-fi capable.+ No lag on the web.+ Excellent screen layout makes for easy navigation.+ The virtual keyboard is one of the better keyboards. It has large enough keys and a very good spell-checker. Spell-checker is not annoying and it is accurate.+ Signal strength is as good as any phone I have used. No dropped calls.+ The HTC Hub is a nice feature- I like it for local temperature.+ The touch screen has been responsive to fingertips. No stylus needed.+ Another nice feature is that the charging port uses a universal charger plug.+ Syncing with my home computer via USB port is simple. The Trophy uses Zune software to transfer mp3 music to the phone.+ Call clarity is very good.I would rate the speakers as average for listening to music. Some phones have better speakers than what the Trophy has. I rarely use this phone for that.As far as battery life, I haven't used the standard battery. I bought a 3500mAh extended life battery and door when I purchased the Trophy and have used that exclusively. This particular battery will go for more than a day on average for me.This is my second Windows phone and I have been impressed with how well it works and the ease of syncing with my home computer.I haven't found anything negative with this phone so far and would buy it again.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice phone", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R2ZUB87XBNCSQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone as a back up, to my iPhone.
