Slim, lightweight and with super features.Set up is almost instant. Just put in your simcard and you are automatically hooked on to  the network within a few seconds.Signal strength is great.

Gets full signal bars most of the time.Never drops a call.Reception is even better than my old Samsung Galaxy S3 with 4glte.Battery life is super. I could download lots of applications, surf the net and make at least 100 calls and the battery life was intact.The 8MP main camera is absolutely clear. The auto focus and face detection works well.MMS is fully supported.Downloading apps is extremely fast and most useful apps are already installed.WIFI works at blazing speeds.The network data connection on AT&T; is a fast and consistent at great. speed.Has a built in FM TUNER as well.

I had fallen in love with it! Huge screen, great picture, latest operating system. Hooked the phone up to the AT&T; network and everything was great for about 12 hours. When I was driving all of a sudden the phone lost service. I thought nothing of it for about an hour when I realized that it was not getting service still. So I went to two different AT&T; stores to try and figure out what the heck was going on and no one could figure out why it refused to tap into the network. Everything was reading right the phone just refused to have service. I am now returning the phone to Amazon. This makes me sad because I had fallen in love with the Lightahead while it was working. I would check with your carrier before purchasing this phone to ensure that they are familiar with it so that they are able to trouble shoot any issues that might arise.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Customer Service", "Author": "Dianna  Mills", "ReviewID": "R1ER180UWW3X4K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "At first it was a great phone and worked great!

The phone worked fine out of the box, I have/had two issues:1) The phone ships with a leather case, but it is very simple...most will want a different case.  Due to the odd size of the phone (yes, it is slightly bigger than the Galaxy S4), I have been unable to find any alternate case that fits.2) Last week the phone began having problems, the screen is only partially responsive to touch.  I did some research which advised doing a factory reset...didn't help. Unfortunately, they only have a 30 day return policy.While it technically still works, the inability to navigate the touch screen without repeatedly touching an icon 6-7 times makes it a brick.
