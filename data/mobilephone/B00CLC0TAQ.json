I cram packed it until it nor my SD card could hold anymore. I deleted items as needed. I played on this thing most of the day. It's amazing, it's quick, it's clear, it has the play store and can be customized, you name it! Oh, and it takes excellent pictures!!Recently though, mind you after the torture I put it through, it started freezing, I would be charging the battery around five or six times a day, until finally, I killed it :(  I rarely ever turned this phone off, and decided to give it a break the other night. It met its doom. When I turned it back on it just freezes at the LG screen and a hard reset doesn't work. I was devastated!!Would I buy another? Absolutely!!!", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little phone, solid.", "Author": "uberbigpete", "ReviewID": "RHSACITGV14A8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Runs great!
