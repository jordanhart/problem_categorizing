{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Great Phone, Few Issues", "Author": "rawr", "ReviewID": "RMNWGWSVPQCOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone in early August, however from another online retailer. Most have commented already on the pros, so I'll focus on the cons because every product has its flaws. The Acro S is a great phone due to optimized performance (compared to other Snapdragon S3 phones), good ICS UI/customizations, and being waterproof, the main selling point. Battery life is also slightly better than average, on the most part, I can fit in 2~3 hours of talking time, some moderate usage (mostly Wifi internet browsing, Pulse, emails, WhatsApp, text messages). Having both ample storage space (16GB) and an easily removable micro-sd slot means you can cram pretty much anything you want into it.The HDMI port is also a standard micro plug, unlike some others where they are combined with the USB port. Talking about ports, the largest downside to this phone is that due to it being waterproof, all its ports have a plastic cover. This cover makes listening to music on this phone impossible on the go. If you were to leave it plugged in with a headphone in a pocket, it will very likely snap off. Therefore, getting a bluetooth unit is pretty much required for listening on the go (like the Sony MW600, Samsung HS3000). The other is that, continuous opening and closing of these ports will also wear them down. There is a rubber layer under it that protects the phone from water. Therefore, USB transfers/charging should be done only if needed, it is why a dock is provided on these waterproof phones.The other major issue is the camera. Yes it does have a high MP count, but on 100% crop, noise issues are very noticeable and quite bad. They are still great pictures, lots of details, good color reproduction, and fairly sharp, just that there is quite a bit of noise (even on ISO100 in bright sunlight). This shouldn't be an issue for most people because the pictures themselves look absolutely great when uploaded to FB and others (downsized). The front camera is alright for video calls, and is 720p. The phone's hardware is 100% the same versus the Xperia S, only waterproof and the inclusion of a micro-SD card slot (advanced users can even flash custom XS's roms onto the Acro S directly, only micro-sd doesn't work). This means the screen really is one of the best ones. It is fairly accurate in colors (not overly saturated), has good viewing angles, and looks very sharp (highest PPI in phones).During normal usage, the first issue would be the capacitive buttons, you actually hit slightly above the icons, but you should quickly catch on after a day or two. The second thing is that quick capture doesn't always work, and that the Bravia Engine option is currently not working as well after the ICS rollout (but this should be sorted out later on with more software updates). The last issue I have had with this phone is that there is a slight creaking sound when you hold the phone at the bottom and top corners of the top battery cover (sounds a bit confusing I know). These looks like weaker points in the construction simply because there are button cutouts next to it, making it a bit less sound. However, it only does it if you hold it a bit firmly, and it does still feel secure. In the two months+ I've used it, I haven't dropped this phone yet, but have used it daily and pretty much just stuffed it into a pocket everyday. It has held up fine, no scratches anywhere (even the included screen protector), and the text on the back and button icons haven't rubbed off yet (they will eventually though...). I've only had the phone crash by itself two times, which for a smartphone, is pretty good (My old X10, and iPhone 4 would crash 2~3 times a week). GPS is fairly quick to get, though Wifi signal seems to be a bit weaker (not sure if it is a bar display difference, have no actually checked the true db values). All phones side by side in a room, the Acro S displays the only 2 to 3 bars (out of 4) versus 3 to full on the X10, solid full signal on a laptop. I personally have not tried the bluetooth (range) and NFC yet, so I cannot comment on those.Audio quality is good, headphone output is clear. Call volume isn't super loud, but it is acceptable. Microphone is fairly clear and reduced background noise, but any wind will still silence you.The other thing to remember is, the battery is sealed! If you need to travel long distances, carry a portable battery charger (already do, so this didn't concern me). The battery inside is not user serviceable even if you open the back lid, it has been sealed with waterproof film, unlike the XS. On the bright side, it is a 1840~1900mAH one that holds up fairly well.Also any advanced users out there will have to know that the development community (XDA) on the Acro S is not as active due to late entry into the US market, however, there are many mods still available for it (as it works with any XS mod). Root can be done with literally 2~3 clicks should you worry about that.Most people should know that this phone does NOT work on Tmobile's (or Verizon/Sprint) 3G network, at least for now and most places. There ARE some places that you can get 3G, though mostly in the large cities. You can check their progress (unofficial) on airportal.de , which shows areas where the 1900/2100 band has been spotted (means iPhones and other international phones can work on 3G!).Overall, this phone is great. Its very well optimized (Sunspider, and other benchmark scores are quite ahead of other similar hardware phones), designed, and so far, seems fairly sturdy and well built. Like I said before, if you use your phone as your main music device, you might have to consider either using a bluetooth unit, or look away because the cover is flimsy and will snap off if you stuff it in a pocket and go jogging with it. Also don't expect this to replace your main camera other than for quick FB posts because there are quite severe noise issues (but they still look good). I really enjoy using this phone.For whoever is also looking at the Xperia V (I was), the successor to this phone, the V at the moment (October) does not look like it will enter the US market because the \"h\" version with US 3G bands has not been announced yet. The normal LTE version does not have LTE or 3G bands that the US can use (only Europe/Asia). Also it has 8gb internal memory instead, a VGA front camera, and no dedicated camera button. Similar camera sensor (13MP, but still same Exmor R, not RS), though with the S4 chip instead. You trade off some features to get a bit more speed and slightly better battery life (just a speculation as the S4 is more energy efficient but the Xperia V comes with a smaller, replaceable battery). If you are holding off on this phone for now to wait on the V, it is a tough choice since there are quite a good amount of trade offs, plus the Acro S's price has dropped now.Update December : 4 Months, though I dropped it a few times, no chipping at the chrome paint (or the body) yet, still waterproof. No new bugs/issues to report. Latest version of fw is .55, which you will have to use XDA's method of flashing (Flashtool) in order to keep root (no longer possible to use the old simpler method).Update Jan : After winter vacation my parents dropped my phone while trying to take a photo. There is a slight dent (nearly invisible, and you can hardly feel it) in the plastic housing but nothing major. It was about a meter drop onto solid marble. It is still waterproof. I forgot to say that Bravia Engine is working if anyone cares about it. Furthermore, after spending time home with a DLNA TV/BD Player, I've tested the Media Remote and Media Server (Connected Devices app). The app works flawlessly and while there is obvious room for improvement, nicely for a HX750 and a S590 player. It replicates the remote functions, can act as a keyboard input, and stream music and videos quickly to the television or to the player.After messing around with quite a large number of apps installed so far I have suffered only one freeze, but it was recoverable after about 10~15 seconds. The phone has not reset itself yet.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome device, great vendor.", "Author": "Theosharaf", "ReviewID": "R33QFJTC1KG1LY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay this phone is just amazing, It has the best screen available on any smart phone at the moment of writing this review as it has the highest pixel density, it can only be matched with the Xperia S, the water resistance work as promised, i just filled the bath tub and threw the phone the moment i unboxed it and it worked without a glitch, it's super fast and smooth i downloaded Asphalt 7 and Dead Trigger and they ran without a hiccup, the phone come with a pre-installed factory screen protector which is the same with all Xperia phones, if your screen get scratched don't panic because this is just the screen protector, Aot of people think that these are scratches on the actual screen, relax they are not, the phone screen is very tough and hard to scratch and i suspect it's made of dragontrail glass however i can't confirm, the Camera is amazing as it's the same exact Camera as the Xperia S, rooting the phone for those who do so went with ease same goes to unlocking the bootloader as it's not restricted on this international version, Now i also have to say that this vendor is amazing, most vendors remove the original supplied dock that comes with this phone and sell it separately however i got the phone with all the original accessories as promised, i really highly recommend this phone from this vendor, it's a high end superpowerful phone that is Play Station certified and got an amazing camera and sound output (Sony Walkman), that is rugged and water resistant, the best smartphone ever made in my opinion, perfection.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Water Resistant phone worldwide!", "Author": "Besh", "ReviewID": "R36808CG3SP53J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I say this with confidence, this phone is one of the best android phones you could get today, and the technology offered inside is superb. Sony are known for their premium products, so if you care about class this phone is for you!The most thing that grabbed my attention with the Acro S is how stable and fast it is. I felt as if the software and hardware were meant to last for ever! Sony did an outstanding job with this phone, it's even better than the Xperia S and ion in my opinion and I say this from experience.Pros:1- A great bright HD resolution screen, the screen is really sharp and reflects vivid colors with the Mobile Bravia from Sony which makes it epic.2- The phone comes with android 4.0.4 out of the box for the convenience of your mind ( the phones runs very smooth! Better than the SG3)3- Water and dust resistant phone.4- The best camera offered on an android phone, a 12mp camera with Exmor-R technology for taking better pictures in low light conditions.5- loud and clear speakers.Cons:1- It's a little thicker than the SG3 and HTC One X, however, the thickness makes it more comfortable to hold in your hands.2- The capacitive buttons works great, however, you may need some time to adjust for their sensitivity but I promise you you'll get used to them in no time.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony has exceeded my expectations with its Xperia acro S!", "Author": "Louis A. Prendiz \"sony guru\"", "ReviewID": "R7EXPGJJLJNZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first learned about the acquisition of Ericsson by Sony, my dream to see a purebred Sony Xperia phone came true!  With the release of Sony's Xperia ion 4G LTE phone, I became even more interested in what was to come.  At first, I thought about getting the Xperia ion.  However, the phone was a little too big for me.  So, I waited a little longer, and the wait paid off!  After a little additional time since its announcement, Sony finally released its much anticipated Xperia acro S.  The acro S was very similar to the Xperia ion.  However, aside from not being 4G LTE, the acro S beats the Xperia ion and any other Sony Xperia phone released to date by Sony!  At 5.0\" tall and a 2.6\" wide, the acro S is not too big and not too small.  It's perfect for viewing pictures and videos, as well as for surfing the Net.  With its amazing 12.1 MP camera and at 1280 x 720 pixels, viewing pictures and HD videos is a true delight!  The acro S also comes preloaded with the new Adroid 4.0 software, so there's no need to upgrade it at all.  The back of the acro S is rubbery, which aids in gripping it better.  It also comes with a desk stand to safely and conveniently place on a desk.  The acro S has a micro USB and a micro HDMI ports, and it's DLNA certified!  One thing that I didn't like was the fact that Sony didn't include the miro SD memory.  It's also easy to create a WiFi hotspot with the acro S, unlike with the iPhone series phones.  And finally, the water and dust resistance are world class.  I highly recommend buying this phone, if you can afford it.

You also need to set the proper APN settings.I added a NET10 SIM to test the phone, and used these settings (from net10sim.com/support.php):Name net10APN tfdataMMSC h t t p : / / mms-tf.net (no spaces)MMS Proxy mms3.tracfone.comMMS Port 80After it's added, the H appears above the signal bars. I also tried a T-Mobile SIM, but I was in a roaming area so I couldn't verify its 3G connectivity.I bought this phone for the ANT+ built-in as well as the waterproofing and wet finger tracking. I was thinking of using a MOTOACTV but I figured I might as well get an ANT+ phone to only carry 1 device, and also have Endomondo, etc. upload data automatically.I have the phone paired with these ANT+ devices: Wahoo Fitness Speed & Cadence Sensor for iPhone, Wahoo Fitness Soft Heart Rate Strap for iPod/iPhone, Wahoo Fitness Stride Sensor for iPhone. Even though they say iPhone, they're ANT+ devices, so they work with this phone.The 720p screen is beautiful. I have the brightness set on the second lowest setting, and I can still see the screen fine outdoors.The 3 Android \"buttons\" at the bottom and sometimes be a pain to tap. They're part of the screen, so tap them lightly just like the screen, not click like a button.The battery lasts me well over a day. The included charger dock does NOT charge if connected to a computer. It MUST be connected to an AC adapter that offers higher voltage/amperage than a computer USB port. You can charge the phone with a computer if connecting to the USB port. The charger for the Sony Ericsson Hi-Fi Bluetooth Stereo Headset with FM Radio (awesome headset by the way) charges this phone by using either the USB port or connecting it to the charging dock. The phone doesn't fit in the dock if you're using a case on the phone, which is annoying to remove the case each time, but it's better than wearing out the usb cover's rubber seal as that's what provides the water proofing.I don't use any of the social (Facebook,Twitter,Google+) apps, so I uninstalled and disabled what I could.I multiple email accounts configured: Exchange in the Email app, IMAPS in the Email app, Gmail in the Gmail app, and Hotmail/Outlook in the Outlook.com app.The Smart Tags are nice to enable/disable BlueTooth, Wifi, etc rather than dig through the settings app, or leave them on and drain battery. The phone came with 2 tags, and I purchased the Sony Xperia Full Set of 4 NFC Smart Tags for Xperia S, Xperia U & Xperia Sola for 6 total, but apparently you can only use the 4 tags, so now I have 2 duplicates that I place somewhere else in the house for the House action.When WiFi is enabled, the phone will automatically turn off the 3G (the H above the signal bars disappears). I keep WiFi enabled at home and work because it uses less power than the 3G radio, and it also routes the email and other traffic over WiFi rather than my data plan.The phone came with Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS), and Sony has announced that the phone will be getting a 4.x Jelly Bean (JB) upgrade in a few weeks.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent Cellphone", "Author": "Sorelbis Guerrero", "ReviewID": "R1BOBM8C098A6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelent Cellphone, all that i want it! 100% recomended, love it! it has all the nice function and can be used in water....", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "simply wonderful", "Author": "Sandu Panus", "ReviewID": "R1AL5GHRM1ZM9P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I search many information every-time I buy something, so I knew almost everything about this phone, and it's simply wonderful", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Product arrived broken", "Author": "Roanne", "ReviewID": "R38WGIHFPMQ3YC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone has a defective microphone and the other person on the line can never hear me.I tried the warranty, it didn't work and I tried fixing it, but every time the microphone is changed it burns.Do not purchase it!", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "A very good cell phone", "Author": "Masters", "ReviewID": "RVIA3A56DAG27", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This cell phone is very complete and powerfull, however in ocations a have some issues with the video recording, sometimes while i'm recording the recording stops...

After a careful review of smartphones in the middle price range (i.e. $400 - $500), I narrowed down the search to the LG OPTIMUS 4X HD P880 and the SONY XPERIA ACRO S. While the LG comes with a Quad-core 1.5 GHz processor, versus the dual-core of the Sony, I was compelled by the hard-button camera key and the picture quality. Another plus for the Sony is the dust and water resistant case and the fact that you receive a docking station to charge the phone. There are smartphones with bigger screens and better processors than the Sony Xperia but the quality of the case, the screen, and the camera features led to the buying decision. I have not experienced any cons yet, except minor issues like inserting the SIM card, which requires small fingers or long nails or the covers for the micro USB and mini HTML ports.

I mean, a 12MP, ice-cream sandwich, HD video resolution, and all the very many basic features of a smartphone. Having said all that, there are still issues with the phone. First, it has bad battery life if u are a frequent phone user, which I am- but an idle phone will last you a day and a half, or two days. Second, it isn't exactly scratch resistant, because I had a sharp metallic thing chip slightly the top and the one side of the phone when it fell from my hand to the ground once. I was lucky the chip wasnt too obvious, so I can still call it a new phone!I like the camera- however, I still use my instagram and Picasa for edits!!Overall, not bad- I can certainly live happily with it if I handle carefully, or buy an otter box or something!!

I could fix it but damn i hate to see this chinese keyboard right there!Pros:Amazing screen quality!The desing looks great, everybody confuse it with a lumia! loolThe camera is just what they say it is!
