{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Trying to replace iPhone 3g / good basic phone with a few flaws", "Author": "C. Wilson", "ReviewID": "R3O5HTSN321TF0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I grew weary of the expense and relatively poor call quality of my iPhone 3g.  Rather than shell out another $200+ for the latest version of something that was already disappointing and then commit to minimum monthly payments of least $75.00 for two years, I put the thing in a drawer. Hopefully, an iPad 2 will fill in the gap left by the iPhone's retirement.First the Pro's & Con's and then the full explanation.Pro's:  Excellent call quality using both T-Mobile and AT&T; SIM cards in Austin, Texas.  No more dropped calls, cut-outs, and yelling into my iPhone. (keep in mind, the call quality using either card may vary with your location). My AT&T; SIM card provided better call quality with this phone than I had with my AT&T; iPhone 3g.  Interesting looks in a sort of retro form-follows-function way.  If you're a designer or an architect you'll appreciate the aesthetic.  Switching from AT&T; plan to a prepaid SIM card with AT&T; has taken my monthly cell phone bill from a minimum of $75.00 per month down to $15.00 per month.  No temptation to constantly check email or text messages.  This phone prevents the automatic behavior of checking your email every five minutes.  Great volume on the speaker and no complaints from people I call that they can't hear me.  Weeks of standby battery time. The first charge lasted over a week even with frequent and extended daily use.  If traveling in Europe, simply purchase a SIM card over-the-counter in what ever Country you're in and pop it in this phone.  Cheap and quick.  It's something of a conversation starter.  Some seem to delight in making fun of this phone when I use it.  I tell them I picked it up in Moscow.Con's:  In the U.S. this phone works with only two cell phone companies; AT&T; & T-Mobile.  None of the others provide a SIM card.  On the upside, this dramatically reduces the research time necessary to choose a cell phone carrier.  Tiny cheap looking and feeling chrome plated plastic switches on the left side make it difficult to adjust the volume,the ringer and on and off switch.  At first, I thought this made it a poor phone for grandma & grandpa, but I was proven wrong.  With the exception of the giant buttons on the front, the controls are somewhat difficult to manipulate.  You'll need your fingernails to use this phone.  However, my elderly father was more than willing to put up with the tiny buttons in order to enjoy the sound quality and large buttons on the front.  The sounds the phone makes are not intended for many business settings.  John's phone makes a loud metallic \"tonk\" noise audible to everyone around you each time you press a number key. The auditory feedback is intended to provide reassurance that you've actually pressed the key.  It sounds like a metal hair pin being snapped on an empty mint tin.  The ringer sounds like an old weak wind-up alarm clock.  The longer the ring continues, the more it trails off.  I swear it sounds as if there is a real bell in the phone ringing.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Extended review:John's phone is simple, clunky and quaint like an old Russian compact car.  It looks more solid in the advertising photographs than it is in reality but I haven't had anything break on it yet.  It's very lightweight plastic and for some reason the designers chose to use cheap looking (and feeling) chrome plated plastic switches on the side of the phone.  It's a little hard for your thumb to get a good grip on the thumb wheel to adjust the volume on the top left side.  It needs a slight rubber coating so your thumb can grip it without a lot of pressure and slipping.  The on / standby / off switch on the bottom left side is tiny and takes a good bit of pressure from a fingernail to flip to any of the three positions. Three in one switches make a product more complicated to operate rather than less.Also, for some reason you need to push the switch slowly through each of three positions in sequence or the phone sort of \"locks up.\"  You can't just flip it quickly from \"On\" to \"Off\", passing through \"Standby\" in the middle along the way.  If you do, it freaks out the phone & it wont function.  The large round push buttons on the dial pad make the phone easier to dial than most every other cell phone. The phone is a novelty for those who enjoy design or like having something a bit out of the ordinary. Oh . . . and it's also inexpensive.When dialing, each button press causes a slightly delayed hollow metallic \"tonk\" noise from the speaker that can be heard by everyone near you, to let you know you've pressed the button properly.  However, the \"tonk\" auditory feedback noise is so slow to respond after pushing the button that I often have the whole number dialed before three \"tonks\" have sounded.  For me the too-slow and loud auditory feedback is actually a hindrance to dialing rather than a help. The delayed feedback is confusing when you're in a hurry to dial.  Strange, but the phones internal processor can't seem to keep up with rapid analog inputs such as flipping switches or pressing the number keys.  Also, the \"tonk\" dialing noise makes it sound like a child's toy.  It takes the phone from interesting and slightly eccentric into \"goofy\" territory.  Tonk. . . tonk .. . tonk . .tonk..tonk . . tonk.  It's amusing at a family or social gathering with friends, but a bit awkward to use in the context of a business meeting or in front of clients.In the U.S. only three companies (really two) can provide a SIM card that will work in this phone  They are AT&T;, T-Mobile and Walmart.  Walmart Family Cell Phone Plan sells a more expensive SIM card as part of a family plan but Walmart uses T-Mobile's towers so it's really another T-Mobile plan.  T-mobile is frustrating and inadequate for several reasons.  First, T-mobile requires you to be able to receive a text message with a password on your handset in order to open an on-line account to work with your account, obtain customer support, technical support, refill your minutes, etc.  John's phone will not show you text messages.  There is no work-around & T-mobile will not email you a password or give you one over the phone.  Also, T-Mobile doesn't disclose this up-front, but with a pre-paid plan, they do not allow any call forwarding of your cell phone number.  Take that poor people.  This means you can't use a T-Mobile SIM card with Google Voice, you can't forward your cell-phone to a land-line or to a voice mail-to-email service, etc.  Finally, T-mobile customer service is consistently ranked as one of the poorest.  I can tell you from personal experience I had during my two day trial period of a T-Mobile SIM card that their customer service is poor.  T-Mobile will not refund pre-paid cards and SIMS, even if they do not work in your area very well.  Salt in the wound.  AT&T; also has the problem of only allowing you to get an account password for the web-site via text message.  However, in my case, I had an old AT&T; phone I used with the new SIM card that could receive a text message with my account password.The call quality using either a T-mobile SIM or an AT&T; SIM was significantly better than that provided by the iPhone 3g.  I originally didn't think this phone was very elderly friendly because of the small side buttons, but during a recent family visit to the farm, I pulled out the phone to make a call in front of my elderly father.  He smiled and started deriding my \"goofy phone.\"  As he was talking, I placed it to his ear to hear the dial tone and said \"that's why I use this phone.\"  His response was a first for me and him.  He completely forgot about the next joke he was going to make about my phone and asked me where he could get one.  I took my SIM card out, put his in and he's now using a John's phone.  Because of the lower price, operating costs and the better call quality, I'll be buying another John's phone to replace the one I gave away.  I just won't be dialing many phone numbers with it in front of my clients unless they've known me long enough to appreciate my eccentricities.Hope the notes above help you decide whether or not it's a good fit for you.Update:  I realized that my John's phone arrived with a European wall charger rather than one made to use with U.S. electrical sockets.  I sent an email and John's phone immediately sent me a new U.S. charger at no additional cost.  Their customer service is excellent.  If it weren't for the harder to use side switches and sluggish phone response to physical inputs, it would have had five stars.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "A dumb phone - Love it!", "Author": "mwaustin", "ReviewID": "RLTU284P02YLR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A phone that does nothing but make phone calls. This is exactly what I've been looking for. No more expensive data plans. No more distracting text messages. Simplicity! The over all design is elegantly simple and a real conversation starter amongst the iphone crowd.I would give the phone a 5 star rating, but the side buttons are somewhat poorly designed. There are two three position switches that are very stiff. You can not slide they from one extreme to the other without first stopping at the middle position for a few seconds. Because of the stiffness of the switches, this is difficult to do. I expect that these switches will become less stiff with more use.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this \"dumb\" phone! Great for distracted teens and students!", "Author": "Mara Stumbo", "ReviewID": "R3GJ7HC7H6HAU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got a \"sweet pink\" version of this phone for my teenage daughter who basically could not stop texting and her social life and grades became a mess,plus high bills of over usage.I know eventually she will have to learn to discipline herself not to constantly text and search with a high-tech phone. However, she can learn to do that with her own money someday.  The internet and texting can have many negative consequences for teens, especially social media sites, bullying, constant distractions affecting concentration and life in general.  John's phone keeps things simple, allowing the user not to be obsessed with constant interaction with others. To give their minds rest from the \"drama\" of teen life.  I would recommend this to any parent who has a child that is no longer interacting with the real world and spends too much time in cyber fanatasies that often pose dangers for our children.  Also, I look at the instant gratification that texting and cell phones give as dumbing down our society. I thank God everyday for John's phone!", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Conversation Piece", "Author": "Happy Customer", "ReviewID": "R2Y6H3CVNC1HRE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is truly a one of a kind phone. And it does everything it says it does. I was surprised to discover it does receive text messages you just can't send them. The seller (CBS) wasn't sure if it would work on the AT&T; network but my prepaid AT&T; SIM card worked fine. I got a \"SIM card registration error\" with my T-mobile SIM card however.

It is apparently so simple that the buttons do not always work, even when one follows the manual.  I am not sure if this is due to the toy parts that they used for the slider switches and the volume control, or if it is a problem with the internal electronics or firmware.  Either way, this phone is perhaps good enough to throw into the back of your car and forget about until you need help at an accident scene, but it isn't good enough to carry every day.
