{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Galaxy 551 - misleading info provided by Amazon", "Author": "AR", "ReviewID": "R14CZ3JS56JYFN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've ordered it for my daughter - was just looking for an unlocked QWERTY entry level Android. Got the phone the other day - i was ordering the one from Amazon. So what i've received was:- the phone itself: it is a not a factory unlocked version - it is a hacked / unlocked version of Orange (EU operator) phone, with Orange software (you can't uninstall this), Orange logos on it and the worst thing - not a QWERTY keyboard. This is a French version, so you get AZERTY keyboard, since French keyboard looks different.- what i've received in the box also left a strange impression: it was sent not in original box (at least Samsung was spelled correctly on the box), \"hand-crafted\" manual with a lot of spelling mistakes, the phone itself was not in original protective shields (looked like it was opened before), earphones in the packcage with English / GB marking, while charger was maked in French.Anyhow, this is still a good phone, and if you are ok with a French AZERTY keyboard and not a factory unlocked phone you may want to try it. Otherwise you may want to try the one from eBay. I will be returning the phone to Amazon, and will most most probably be looking for another phone from other vendors.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "NOT a QWERTY keyboard!", "Author": "Manda \"Manda\"", "ReviewID": "RJ1ZCOJU9HWCV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I read the reviews, and saw that some people were saying it, and that some were getting a QWERTY, so I took a chance.  Sadly, I was not a winner, I did not get a QWERTY keyboard, I got what I can only describe as a French AZERTY keyboard.  Now it is too late to send it back for an exchange before Christmas.  Also know that the one I received was an \"Orange\" branded phone, and that it had been completely opened and mauled a bit, I am guessing that they simply bought a whole bunch of old French Orange cell phones in bulk, and are opening them, and \"unlocking\" them, and reselling them (or trying to, as they are knowingly misleading people with the bold letters QWERTY in the description).So in closing:Opened (box mauled, not suitable for a gift, unless you like giving people things that appear used).It is new (but man-handled during the unlock process).Looks like they may have been the \"$1 with 2-year contract\" phones from Orange (Orange branding everywhere).NOT a QWERTY keyboard. (I think it's french) Top row \"AZERTYUIOP\" Middle row \"QSDFGHJKLM\" Bottom row \"WXCVBN\"Not happy, as I was trying to get this as a gift for my daughter.  I would have paid more for a new factory unlocked phone if I was able to find one on Amazon, but this was the only Samsung Galaxy I5510 I could find so I took a chance.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "great phone for the price", "Author": "ERONyX", "ReviewID": "R8LEBBE7YBD2M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "got the phone the other dayit's kind of hard to access the upper side of the keyboard buttons but the rest looks okfor the money spent looks to be a good oneAndroid is running smooth and picks the WiFi networks around", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good phone, unlocked, android 2.2 AZERTY keyboard", "Author": "mariangelagz", "ReviewID": "R537RYO3DHKFR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone works perfectly has a beautiful desing and a good camera.

Each time, the phone has arrived with a keyboard that is laid out different from standard US QWERTY keyboard. The item description shows QWERTY keyboard.

I wanted the slide out keyboard for easy texting, which is very difficult with some keys in the wrong places. The phone does have a pop-up on screen keyboard, which is QWERTY, when you close the slide out.
