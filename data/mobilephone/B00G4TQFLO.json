I thought I would give it a shot so I ordered, and I could not be happier. The phone is lightning fast due to the processors and works great for phone calls, texts, email, apps, web surfing, and games! The only issue was the slow shipping from China, but that is to be expected. I recommend buying from an American shipper for faster shipping times and more reliable service. Again, I highly reccomend this product: a great phone at a great price.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "no difference between this phone and the actual note 3", "Author": "Candace Vandyke", "ReviewID": "R3UMSIA6YQ19MA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a samsung note 3 through verizon and found this phone after I decided to switch to a differenr carrier, so I do have first hand experience with the other product..there is absolutely no difference and this phone is a fraction of the price. the features are all there, multiwindow tasking..it is missing polaris office but i never used that program anyway..all the google features are there, and all my apps from my previous phone downloaded to this one and work perfectly. The phone is sturdy and very well made surprisingly. The leather back says synthetic leather but is soft and supple not that plastic kind. The speaker for media also does a great job..i ordered the phone directly from ulefone..i recieved an extra battery, a smart view case and the regular back as well. My single negative on this phone is that the stylus doesnt match the quality of the phone. It's very cheaply made. But with the 400 I just saved I don't mind buying a better one", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "I STILL DONT HAVE MY PHONE!\u00a1!", "Author": "Heather H.", "ReviewID": "R293SY3LTVUZW8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I never received my phone I ordered my phone on DEC.12th and I still have not gotten my phone...I emailed this company and they never answered back and its been almost 2 months now..it was a Christmas gift so much for that so I don't know what to think l would just like to know where's my phone or where's my money????", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "tda", "ReviewID": "R32GW016GYKZVX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone has the look and feel of the real samsung galaxy.  It is an international version so all the functions do not work. My S pen does not work and I am considering returning it for a new one but just dont want to wait the shipping time.  Other than that the delivery was about 3 weeks from China to Georgia. Once you get a tracking number I suggest you go to the USPS website to place tracking on the device so you can see its every move; even sign up for the email alerts.  I ordered this phone 6 days after I ordered the same one from another seller but this came first. Im still waiting on the first one which I will compare and do a review on later once it arrives. The dealer has been very nice answering any questions and concerns and said that I have a 2 year warranty.  As far as the S Pen, my coworker is buying a the real galaxy with her carrier and I am going to see if her S Pens works in mine so I can know if its just the S Pen or the phone.  Let me be clear, it works in the memo note etc but the menu does not open once I pull out the S Pen.  So I can live with that (I think). lol", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "update on the phone not happy customer", "Author": "jessica", "ReviewID": "R3V8LDYB5OUU4P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the phone does not work power button is stuck so it wont turn on at all and i got the sim card for it and it wont register to the phone so i would like to return this phone and just get my money back....please and thank youjessica", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3Q65OOIPFSPXZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone itself is nice I have no complaints with that. but since I have had it, it has alarmed and had blinking lights and only chinese writing on the screen so I couldnt fix it, i could only take the battery out to get it to stop, and it has done it twice.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "unlocked note 3 by ulefone", "Author": "Melissa L.", "ReviewID": "RFFBYCD10DLOX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "They delivered on time but the phone is having clutch problems and sometimes when shut down phone and turn back on the phone is in chinese and i set it to English several of times and the phone also freeze a lot", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "tamara garlejo", "ReviewID": "RP6UECI00P3XM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the phone.

The phone doesn't detect my Sim card and its signal for the carrier is inaccurate.2. It doesn't detect when i put my earphones in the phone. It plays on both the earphones and the phone speaker so im unable to privately listen to my music. The sound quality is the worst i ever heard from a phone honestly.3. It wont let me pull down the menu bar.4. Theirs a limit on the KB of sending MMS messages. The limits only 300kb and i cant send most of the pictures i have.5. For the carrier i chose(which is straight talk)i am supposed to be able to call, text, and have internet for unlimited. The phone is slow and takes up to ten minutes just to load onto Google when i have full service and it wont even allow me to make local calls!6. When i try to download music, it would say my song is complete but when i listen to the song on the device the song glitches more like skipping as if i got it off a scratched CD!7. But the design of the phone itself is decent. I loved the fact that it came with a flip-case and the battery life is off the chain.8. For a temporary phone to text off of, its great. The Wifi on it is amazing and fast.9. But i am all about the sound quality of my music and this is definitely not compatible.", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Shinobi", "ReviewID": "R21CO3UC4FRQUM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "after looking around and checking some other note 3 for the price this one is worth the buy if your'e looking for a clone best part is that the phone is unlocked for almost every carrier with mines i plan on using h20 or straight talk haven't picked yet but might lean towards h20 just to test the network. either way great price for a note 3 clone really can't tell them apart.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work for At&t.; ...", "Author": "Megan", "ReviewID": "RS0QHJF4MHPAS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are needing this phone to work for at&t.; IT WILL NOT WORK!
