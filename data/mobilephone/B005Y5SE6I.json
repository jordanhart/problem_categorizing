No answer. Then I called. This is what I understood: it is their warranty (not Samsung) and valid only for 3 months. And they are offering the same phone with different descriptions (at least 7 that I could count) and prices.I also wrote to several other vendors that didn't mention the warranty on their ad. Almost all of them answered but  none of those phones has a US warranty.My advise is that if you want to buy this phone unlocked and w/o contract, get one from Google Play and pay (only) $400 for a phone with a real US warranty.Hope this keeps someone from taking a bad decision.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005Y5SE6I"}}
