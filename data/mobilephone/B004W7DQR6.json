However, it started slowing down once i start to download some apps and files.Maybe it was not NAND FLASH drive attached to the device (just a micro SD which takes longer).occsional websurfing is a good device to use.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Franklin Tineo", "ReviewID": "R1WQ1MWHC8PL03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent product I recommend it 100% is what is actually described, besides that is unique, I found it excellent, very good", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Warranty non-existent", "Author": "InAsia", "ReviewID": "R3JBY0721QTD6Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone worked for about three months.

I still have a very hard time picking up WI-Fithat i have in the house......also the battery drains very quickly, maybe i am doing something wrong  by letting it continuously roam, however i charge the battery very often...I do like this phone however,it has a lot of kool features for a low to mid-range phone and apart fro m the previous disadvantages the phone works great.
