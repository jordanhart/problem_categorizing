I bought it new from Walmart. It's a great phone if you just need a simple phone. Very durable too. I ruined my first one because I got it wet, but another one survived after getting dropped in a pond. :p So...just take care of it! :) I have been looking and looking to see where I can get this new; Walmart has stopped selling it new; refurbished ones are sold but I haven't had good experiences with refurbished phones of this model and returned them. The only problem I have with it is that the Internet eventually stops working. A Straight Talk representative can talk to you, though, and they'll send you a replacement phone but make sure you ask if they're sending you a refurbished one!! I think they pretty much send back refurbished ones, not brand new ones :s. You never know. Then again, if you want high-speed Internet with media features, then this phone is not for you; it just shows basic text and small-sized graphics. If you can buy this new, though, and just want a no-frills phone, I would recommend this model.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "for the price, a good phone", "Author": "angela", "ReviewID": "R247OAISGT7RL6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased two of these used for family members to try out Straight Talk's Prepaid service. Neither of them use the internet, so I can't comment on that aspect. They mainly use the phones to talk and text a little. They are both happy with the functionality of the phone, though their one complaint is the phone's ringer isn't loud enough and sometimes they miss calls. They are both hard of hearing, but I do think the highest setting isn't as loud as on other phones. Other than that, though, the phone has very good call quality and they are both happy with it. If you are looking for a cheap phone without any bells and whistles to make calls on and the occasional text, I think this one will work for you. (and I mean NO extras: in case you missed it in the description, there is no camera on this phone and no picture messaging).", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "terrible customer service", "Author": "Gloria Incollingo", "ReviewID": "R28UIPPT7GTDAF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The customer service department has no knowledge of their own product.  I signed up for automatic refill twice and never got the refill.  When I called customer service about the refill they told me to take the  battery out and put it back in. I followed her instructions and now it doesn't work at all.  She said she would send me a new battery which I never received. I am now searching for a new phone and it will not be stright talk .", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceptionally poor customer service - very poor cellphone function", "Author": "Oliver", "ReviewID": "R30956MV0AAI21", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a Straighttalk phone and 30 day service card directly from Straighttalk. I did this because I wanted to deal with the company directly and have them see me as a trusted customer. The FedEx box arrived in good time. As per instructions to activate the phone, I signed onto their website to activate it. No luck - the phone was always reading \"NO SERVICE\". I called the customer service line and waited over 1/2 hour to get someone on the phone (don't hang up and redial as this will put you at the beginning of the line again). No help at all, the representative was 'mystified' and transferred me to his 'superior'. After a 45 minute wait, we again went through all the steps to no avail. This person actually got upset when I said I didn't receive a text message from him. Since the phone had \"NO SERVICE\" I told this manager that it was impossible to receive the message. After about 1/2 hour I asked to be transferred to his manager and got a \"vice president\" on the phone. Zero concern, zero help, as a matter of fact I was told it was not his position to take phone calls. At the end of my willingness to listen to his banter, I asked for a refund and we would part company without animosity. He then informed me he could refund the price of the phone but not the service card as it had already been used. I explained that the service card had been used on this non-working phone and had zero deductions. It didn't matter. Only the phone would be refunded, IF I prepaid the return postage. The vice president's quote \"That's our company policy and there will be no exceptions\". Thank God I called my credit card company on the next call and they cancelled payment without hesitation. They too, were incredulous to what happened. My advice - save your peace of mind and go with a carrier with a reputation.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "It came quicker than expected in the mail, that's about it...", "Author": "cnelson3225", "ReviewID": "RRCVHQZV2N10A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was very excited that it came earlier that it was estimated however when I powered it on all I got was a white screen(on the main screen) and when you turn the phone almost all the way up, you can faintly see the images on screen.

I've had it for two years and it finally is starting to go. Texting is okay - not great. Ironically I kind of think this phone is racist (ie if you are having crabs for dinner its \"arabs\" and if you tell someone to pick up plates, you will instead be telling them to pick up slaves (?) Aside from some really weird predictive texts its okay if you aren't one of those losers that has entire conversations via texts. No camera, alarm works great.
