All in all for what it cost this was a very good purchase. It came in the original box with all the original blackberry accesories. It was clearly a refurbished phone but it was unlocked everything worked right and months later it is still working very well. I have no complaints.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "imperfecto", "Author": "LUCA1975", "ReviewID": "R1URNZUZCR33WP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "il mobile e arrivato a me con numerosi ammaccature e grafiature nello schermo...funziona perfettamente...ho dovuto comprare il cover frontale nuovo", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "ALL GOOD", "Author": "Yehiser", "ReviewID": "RSYK1M7IX6KL0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everything works perfectly, very good buy.
