However, a friend of mine suggested me to verify that this phone was OK by using Apple's phone status system using the serial number.

I think this is completely dishonest and  even fraudulent  not to say against the law.

All the details are on Apple's website, and according to most sources this new OS will be available to the general public this fall.Below is my review of the 16GB model that I purchased in September. Please note that this is strictly my opinion of the phone itself, I have no knowledge of this seller or the condition of the phones they sell. A word or advice however, if you're considering buying from this seller you need to contact them first to get details on the phone, warranty, and whats provided.I had the 8GB 3G model and thought that was great, until I got a demo of the iPhone 4. Man is this version is light years ahead of the original model.With a 1Ghz CPU, and 16GB of flash memory, this thing is a portable office/entertainment center par excellence. I've had this phone for 3 months without a single problem, the display is nice and sharp, the apps load very fast, and I now have over 130 apps to perform just about every duty you could possibly think of with absolutely no impact on performance. And on the AT&T; 3G network, I average download speeds of around 1.8Mbps, and over 1M upload speeds....and how do I know that, cause I got an app that tells me that's how. BTW, the display is the equivalent of a 960x640 on your desktop (double the 3G model) so what you see is essentially a high res yield and page loads are superfast. And resident memory, after a full days use I just checked and still had 120Mb of Ram available. On the 3G model that number was usually down around 4Mb by the end of the work day and had to be refreshed.I was in the design/manufacturing business for 20 years, and this is by far the most amazing piece of technology I have ever seen or imagined. Even the battery life is 3x better than the previous model, and thats a good thing cause its integrated but a full charge should yield and entire days work of calls, emails, surfing the web, SMS messaging, and play. I no longer need my laptop cause there's nothing I cant do with the iPhone, and that includes sending faxes, editing Excel or Word documents, and even printing. A flash for the 5MP camera, an HD video camera, and even real time video conferencing over a wireless network, and Bluetooth that unlike the 3G model is actually compatible with everything you throw at it, including Garmin GPS....just amazing. This thing even has 2 mics with noise suppression so calls are clearer on the other end. Man, Apple hit this one out of the park.BTW, with all the apps, music, and videos I've got loaded on this thing I've still got 10GB of flash memory remaining. I cant imagine why anybody would need more storage, and the 32GB model isn't any faster and doesn't have any more features. You'll need iTunes on your desktop to get the most out of this phone and iTunes can be a little intimidating at first but its worth the trouble, and all the instruction you need can be found on the web or Youtube for transferring photos, videos, music, apps, etc.Update 12/09/10: I've been reading up on the \"antenna problem\" with the iPhone 4G and have this to say.... It is easily cured by slapping on a hard case or shell on the phone, which eliminates the issue I see some people complaining about. I have personally never experienced this issue because I left the AT&T; store with a protective shell on my phone which virtually everybody I've ever seen with an iPhone has anyway. Very simply you CANNOT replicate the reported \"death grip\" problem with a shell or bumper around the outer frame. Cant be done. And BTW, I don't know if its due to network improvements or what but lately I'm getting 3Mbps+ download speeds so if anything I'm happier with my purchase now than I was 4 months ago. Zero complaints, and that's something most smartphone users of other OEM products can't say.A final word: Beware negative reviews scattered about Amazon that are filled with bad English and are authored by individuals who have written only one review (on the iPhone) and posted it in several locations on Amazon's site. Its easy to pick these out, and they have no doubt been written by the same person.Oh wait, I do have one complaint about the iPhone 4. Several times a month my girlfriend gets mad at me and hangs up in the middle of the conversation so I guess I'm suffering from this \"dropped call\" thing after all. haw haw", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$469.99", "Features": "video recording, HD (720p) up to 30 frames per second with audio\n5-megapixel still camera LED flash,Retina display,\nVGA-quality photos and video at up to 30 frames per second with the front camera\nTap to focus video or still images ,960-by-640-pixel resolution at 326 ppi\n3.5-inch (diagonal) widescreen Multi-Touch display", "Name": "Apple Iphone 4 Black with 16GB Memory Manufacturer Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oMeoKTefL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CRZFQ0U"}}
