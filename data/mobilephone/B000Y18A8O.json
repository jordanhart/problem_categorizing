Not only did it fall completely apart within days, but the screen went white and the phone quit working altogether, (Of course it couldn't work, as it could not attach to the main part of the phone!)  This is the worst experience I've ever had with a product I ordered from Amazon.  I certainly hope I get my money back quickly, so I can buy a decent phone.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "lg chocolate 8500", "Author": "hutsonsixpack", "ReviewID": "R3EDYPB5050GMY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't recommend this phone at all.

The shipping was amazingly fast. It arrived three days before the estimated arrival date. It works perfectly and came well-packed and did not have a scratch on it. charger and battery are included with package. And last but not least, it was extremely easy to set up with Verizon. I had an existing prepaid plan and they were more than happy to switch my plan over. And the process only took about 10 minutes. Overall, i would highly reccomend this phone and the price is unbeatable.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "amazing", "Author": "G.

The censor is so sensitive that when i text it sends the text message when i am actually trying to us the arrows.  At Other times the censor does not work at all.  The phone also turns the internet on when it is in my pocket which causes me to be charged for internet.  When texting, the number buttons stick and cause me to type the wrong letters.  I ended up having to buy a different charger for the phone because the original charger shorted out when using it for the first time.  The phone has never been dropped or exposed to water.  Over all i really hate this phone and want nothing to do with it nor will i ever suggest it to anyone.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loved this phone.", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R299WZM9HWY29O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't have any of the problems others had with this phone. I used it for about 2 years and really liked it. It held up great to everyday use. It still looks brand new & I would still be using it, except I switched to AT&T.; By the way, big mistake there. Verizon has much better coverage and the rates were better.

It has served me well for 5 years with no glitches or mess ups.  I'm sad to say my phone does have to retire as the charging outlet has broken so I have to hold the cord in a certain position in order for it to charge.  But after 5 years, that's pretty understandable and reasonable.  I tried a smartphone a couple years ago but it broke within months so I went back to the LG Chocolate.  I'm sad to see this phone go but I am ready for my next upgrade.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor Performance after 3 weeks.", "Author": "Mike Vieira", "ReviewID": "R6OI5G5RONSLY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my girlfriend and after three weeks it started to act really glitchy. The screen would flicker on and off. And would only work about half the time. Seemed every other day it would just go into a coma then come out of it the next day. Doesn't mean that this model is bad but you might want to do plenty of research before committing your funds.
