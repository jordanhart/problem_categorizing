A decent value for the price.", "Author": "Obscuron", "ReviewID": "R2WD0A906IMAW3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a poor grad student and when my fancy android phone died, this was one of the few replacements I could afford.  Given the price, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it works.I think this phone is designed mainly as a second phone for travelers to take with them on vacation.  It has an extra SIM slot, so you can keep your main SIM in slot 1 and buy prepaid SIMs in airports to use in foreign countries.  The battery lasts for weeks so you could conceivably go for a whole vacation without having to find a plug adapter for your charger.  The flashlight feature might also conceivably come in handy when you're traveling.As a phone, it works great.  The buttons are big and feel durable.  Audio quality during calls is the best I've experienced in three or four phones. Because the battery is so big, the phone has a pleasant heft to it.The other features are very basic.  I haven't tried the camera or music player because I don't have a memory card and the phone has almost no on-board memory.The manual is pretty poor but you don't need it much because the phone is so simple.The only annoying factor is the texting interface.  There is no predictive text so you have to input one letter at a time.  I know this is how we used to do it back in 2000 or so, but it seems painfully slow after using modern phones.  If you don't text much this probably won't be a big deal for you.I would recommend this phone to two groups of people.  Either:  1)  You just need a reliable basic phone and don't have much money to spend.  2) You are going overseas and want a traveling phone so you can leave your expensive phone safe at home.  If either of these describes you then the Tank will probably be a pretty good bargain for you.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good basic phone with some problems", "Author": "First", "ReviewID": "R2ZV4UFAUZRJI4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for one main reason - quad-band functionality plus price. It works fine as a good basic phone, but has some problems and room for improvement.Pros:1. Quad-band unlocked GSM phone with dual SIM.2. Long-lasting battery - very important plus.3. Good basic phone functionality.4. Flashlight is a plus.5. Powerful speakers.Cons:1. No 3.5 mm audio output, and Bluetooth does not connect to outside speakers.2. Phone Memory shows only 10 KB available - you can't save a single picture or a song unless you have SD card (the specifications actually say 16 MB of internal memory).3. The T190i version claims to have access to such social media as Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, MSN etc. via a new menu option - Blu Club. Well, this Blu Club was empty on my phone without any possibility to access social media or internet. At the same time, GPRS connection was functioning and some data exchange was happening when I was visiting Blu Club option. It means that you are charged for the Data if you accidentally click on that option. I think it would be better just to leave it as a basic phone without Internet connection - that is where it is competitive.4. Tried for two weeks to get in touch with BluProducts Services department - no reply whatsoever.5. A few minor problems - the clock is unbelievably inaccurate unless it is updated over the air. The camera has such low resolution that appears to be useless for the present days. And active display could be a little bigger - over the entire window.One more suggestion. The quad-band functionality of this unlocked GSM phone with dual SIM slots brings it into the category of World (or International) phones. From that point of view, it would be nice to have an option to read several different languages, for example, in incoming SMS messages. There is no need for the entire phone programming linguistic support, but reading incoming information in a variety of languages is important, if it can be done.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worked Great!", "Author": "J.

Back then, screens were not color, there were no cameras, limited txt messaging, and whats a data plan?This phone is basic with some perks- it has a low end VGA camera, which is still kinda useful- especially if you are traveling and are afraid you might get lost, you can snap a quick pic of a street sign or some building for reference. It has a 8gb micro SD (not included) capability, so you can snap away for years and not fill it up. A basic LED light that will last for days on a full charge (if not a week), and an extremely large 1800mah battery. Due to its design, it intentionally doesn't have the uber touch screen (the biggest drain of smartphone battery), nor does it use 4g, LTE, HSPA, etc. (which is also a battery drainer). It basically has the same size battery of a smart phone. I have not tried downloading any \"social media\" apps. THey claim up to 30 day battery life, which at the rate its been going, seems totally possible.So some other \"90's\" tech- the phone book is not multi layered- remember back in the day, you would program \"john home\" \"john work\" and \"john cell\"? Then they made it so that you could just have \"John\" and 3 numbers? Ya, go back to the \"home\" \"work\" and \"cell.\". It also doesn't have t9 (motorola license I believe) input, so you will be pecking a lot for txt messaging.You also get some other great old tech- like buttons which work easily, super fast boot times (so you don't mind shutting it off), easy to read display, and superlight weight. The ringer is basic, but great- good because it isn't progressive, it can just be \"loud\".It is a true dual sim dual standby, from my testing- meaning that both lines will work simultaneously. This is cool in a number of ways- I won't get into it, but you can turn one off and one on. or both on. If both are on, it will prompt you for which sim to dial from after the number is entered. NOTE: It is not uncommon for battery time to be cut in half if both antennas are on. You should activate each sim separately when needed (especially useful for those who travel to foreign countries often).Now for the not so good- and why it looses one star:the keypad lock works- but its not intuitive. Takes a little getting used to, but it does let you reprogram it- sorta. still figuring it out.The display will come on as long as the button is pressed. So you could still drain your battery.THe FM radio requires a proprietary usb headset- I will not be investigating this function. (the Jenny TV uses analog TV, so is pretty much a no go in the U.S.)The charger uses Mini USB- except the world has more or less moved on mostly to Micro- not a big deal, as I've probably got 10 or 12 mini USB chargers around.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Elderly user finds it loud enough", "Author": "Crema", "ReviewID": "R1NZAB5IZU0FD2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this phone for my father who wanted a LOUD phone but did not need a data-plan smartphone.

That's when I found out that ALL CLAIMS OF A WARRANTY ARE COMPLETELY BOGUS!!!!!!!  It was after the 30 day Amazon return period, so I contacted the manufacturer about it, only to be informed that the seller is responsible for warranty claims.  They DIRECTLY REFUSED to tell me the terms of the warranty.  You will find that NEITHER the documentation you get with the phone, NOR the product page on Amazon, ACTUALLY DETAILS THE TERMS OF THE WARRANTY.  So, there really isn't a warranty.

I don't text, don't use camera of the phone, don't use it's data access capabilities, don't use Facebook/Twitter/other crappy sites from the phone.So, for $24 I believe it's a good phone which serves its basic purpose: make and receive calls.What I liked:* the phone buttons are big,* numbers on the phone buttons are big,* reception was good,* it's unlocked and works with any GSM provider,* it supports custom MP3 ringtones,* call sound quality was fine with me and loud enough.* size is actually good for me - not too small, but not too big. I was afraid it would be bigger but no.* battery life is pretty good. I charged the phone completely on the 1st day of the month. On the 27th it showed empty battery charge indicator. I only made total of 45-50 minutes of calls and received about 15 test text messages. To me, with such usage and battery capacity it should last at least a full month. So, the battery life may be 'awesome' compared to an overloaded smartphone, but my opinion - only 'pretty good' (like 4.5 out of 5).I haven't tried its quad-band 2-SIM capabilities yet nor I use cell phone cameras. So, no comments on those features.What I didn't like (though minor and thus the rating is still 4 stars):* regardless of where I kept the phone (in a belt case or in a pocket) I kept accidentally 'press' the dial buttons. This made the phone wake up and affected battery life.* when the phone is in 'standby' you can't say if it's completely off - no indicators.* no phone memory. You have to buy an SD card (my 8 Gb card was perfectly recognized by the phone).* no way to change incoming text message notification sound* limited/unclear system configuration menuYes, it looks cheap. May be it breaks in a few months (but I don't think it will happen if you don't drop it). Yes, the screen is small but to dial a number it's absolutely fine (digits are big enough even for elderly, I believe).Yes, the user manual leaves a lot to desire. But when I played with the phone menu for a few minutes I was able to configure all the features I need for myself. Not even reading the manual at all. Yes, the menus are really simplified (as the phone itself), but what do you expect today for under $25?Again, overall I would confirm another reviewer's opinion that it's a good back up phone (especially for travelers).
