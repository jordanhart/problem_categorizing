For a $20 phone, this little phone is amazing versatile! Sound quality is excellent, no trouble with texting, voice mail is fine, speaker phone quality good, etc. If you use a phone as a computer, this isn't for you, but if you actually use a phone as a phone, this is a great little device.", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Practical and Well Priced", "Author": "Nerd Alert", "ReviewID": "R3V8TWYVP4HC7D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My old phone broke and I am waiting to decide on a smartphone, trying to get the cheapest data plan.  In the meantime, I needed something for talk and text.  There are a couple flip phones in the $20 price range, as well as this Alcatel 510A bar-type.  Can a $20 phone really work?BUILDThe plastic case and screen feel sturdy.  Ironically, plastic phones tend to be much more durable than the more expensive phones with Gorilla Glass.  The back has a surprisingly thoughtful touch: a soft rubberized grip.  While the phone looks cheap, the design is not bad and it fits well in the hand.CALL QUALITYThe phone sounds surprisingly good, and that includes the speakerphone.  The reception is a bit less than my old phone, but not terrible.SOFTWAREWhile not very intuitive, the 510A can be figured out without too many headaches.  I have texted, set an alarm to wake me up (practically worth the price alone since it has a battery backup), and inserted contacts.  The alarm and ring tones are pretty bad, and there is no SD card slot to add any.  The phone has no lock, though I have yet to butt dial.The web browser is essentially useless, but the screen would have assured that regardless...SCREENThe phone exceeded my small expectations in other areas, but the screen is like something out of the past.  It has a narrow viewing angle, is tiny (there is plenty of unused space around it), and the image looks fuzzy/garbled.  It works for the basic uses of the phone, but even for texting, something a bit less dated would be nice.  As with most cell phone screens, it is hard to see in sunlight.CAMERANope.SETUPI already have an AT&T; phone on a family plan, so I just put in my card and was ready to go.  Unlike Android, there is no way to automatically sync contacts, so they all have to be put in manually.  A SIM card is included for those who want to start a new plan.OVERALLFor $20, this phone is great as a backup, or if you need a phone without a camera temporarily (jury duty, business, etc.).  If you only use a phone for periodic texting, phone calls, and as an alarm, this may even be a good permanent phone.  However, if you text a lot, you may want to invest a little more in one with a keyboard or decent touchscreen.EDIT:  I found that there is a function to lock the keypad, which is great.  It is just a little unintuitive to find.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "All in the Details", "Author": "Zavi", "ReviewID": "R2KECNMIK9FTSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for a \"drop phone\" meaning emergency use only.

Most of the cons are pretty obvious, given the size and price. The only one that really bothers me is how bad the predictive texting is.Pros:  * Cheap  * Small  * Light  * The whole case is made of plastic, but it feels very solid since everything fits together tightly.  * It has a removable battery.  * It charges via Micro-USB.  * The battery lasts forever.Cons:  * No camera or bluetooth.  * Predictive texting engine doesn't learn words. It also doesn't come with common words like \"sushi\". This would be extremely annoying if this was my primary phone.  * The small size means the keyboard takes some getting used to and the screen isn't large enough to use the included browser.  * It was relatively difficult to set up MMS settings for my carrier (not AT&T;). Voice and normal texting worked fine with no special settings though.  * It has one of those annoying Micro-USB slot covers. I immediately ripped it off.Conclusion: If you don't care about texting, cameras or bluetooth, this would be a great phone.

Nothing on it works well or correctly or consistently except the one feature that will allow the police to develop an extremely close relationship with you.The ringtone cannot  be heard under normal conditions. Even very mild background noise drowns out the insipid sound of this phone failing in the most basic function of all telecommunications equipment: Alerting you that you have a call.The battery drains astonishingly quickly. Most of you out there probably don't dabble in philosophy at all, but this phone will have you pondering the utter futility of recharging your 510a an average of once per day when it doesn't function even with the battery fully charged.But by golly, that feature that no one uses and which shouldn't exist--and which neither the owner's manual nor the AT&T; salesmen will tell you about--the one that allows you to call 911 by holding down the send or 9 key for a full second? Works every time. And I do mean EVERY time you take a step with this piece of junk in your pants pocket.I tried going to the AT&T; store and asking for a different cheap phone, but all they do is say \"No\" without saying \"No,\" which is apparently some sort of postmodern doctrine of customer service: Their salesdrones aren't allowed to say no. They have to say \"No\" by insulting the customer's intelligence with double talk and meaningless gibberish.I am fed up with AT&T; and with this product, and with this dangerous, useless, stupid feature that they are apparently compelled to include (but must never mention) in all their devices as a provision of Obamacare. Don't try to save money by buying it.
