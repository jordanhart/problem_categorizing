By the way, watchign videos and pics on this is great, that screen does a really good job.I was expecting more from the 8.1MP camera... works very good but I was expecting more as the 3.2MP on my Nokia phone still does a better job.That might be a side down but the Bluetooth heads set is a huge plus so we're even :)The only little glitch we saw is that it does not comes in Spanish... it has several other languages but not Spanish... not a real problem but an FYI.And there is an update out there for it, not sure what enhancements it provides but what we noticed is that is changes the games so beware of that.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony Ericsson Aino U10 Unlocked Cell Phone White Color GSM Mobile International Version", "Author": "Milton\u00b4s", "ReviewID": "R1NKN22BXQM95Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "BUY IT USED THE PHONE TOLD ME THAT WAS IN GOOD CONDITION, BUT WHEN I RECEIVED THE PHONE WAS WORKING BUT THE CASE IN BAD CONDITION AND WELL USED FOR HIGH NOT ADVISED ME THAT WAS BROKEN SCREEN.
