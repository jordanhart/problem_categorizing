{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pros and Cons for this phone (Highly recommend)", "Author": "SayedIslam", "ReviewID": "R188MU5L0DMD1Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little cautious to get this cause last time I had a windows phone, it was AWFUL!!! (htc touch pro 2) I've had an iphone and a samsung vibrant before also, so I thought I'd dip my toe into this phone cause it got so many great reviews.Pros:1. It's unbelievably solid! It feels expensive, it feels indestructible, and feels amazing in your hand. Like you know it won't break easily like other phones.2. It's faster than I expected. Internet connection is very fast. Very responsive, hasn't glitched out on me yet, and faster than my friend's iphone 5 <--That's a really big deal!3. User Interface/User Experience is great. It doesn't lag when you have other apps open. It's smooth and isn't overburdened with unnecessary features. I love the live tiles! It's unique, something different for once. I like how you can customize these tiles ANY WAY you want.4. The camera takes amazing pictures as you'd expect. Low light pics are astounding! Some night shots I took almost looked like it was taken during the day! Best phone camera I've ever used!5. Features like Here City Lens, Cinemagraph, and Nokia Music. Now I don't use these apps much, but I've only used them to show off to my friends pretty much. They are very unique and everyone I showed them to were amazed (except my friend who's a die hard Apple user haha).6. It's a really good looking phone. I personally don't think it's too heavy or big. It just is a great looking phone front to back. Sometimes I just stare at it for no reason like a weirdo. Hah.Cons:1. Battery life is DECENT, but not as great as you'd expect or want. I do use it a lot during the day (internet, social media, texting), so I wish it was a little better in that area.2. The package it came in was sub-par. If I'm spending $500, I want better packaging. The box was fine, but the phone came in a weird saran wrap bag or something. No scratches, but still. Also I live in Michigan, so I speak English. The phone's factory settings came in Chinese! Everything was in Chinese. Chinese! I looked inside the instruction manual to see how I can change the language. The instruction manual was in Chinese! I had to go online to figure it out. That's something I shouldn't have to do. This isn't really a con about the phone, just be prepared for that possibly.3. Bluetooth is strange. It pairs with a device, then disconnects for some reason. Tried with multiple phones and it does the same thing. I use bluetooth connectivity once in a blue moon, so I don't care about that at all. But other people seem to care about that. So yeah, there's that.4. APPS! AND INSTAGRAM! App selection is okay. But compare it to Apple or Android, it seems anorexic. And STILL no instagram :(. They have some alternate versions like itsdagram which is kinda cool, but I want the real thing! App selection needs improvement for sure.Ok so that's my 2 cents on this phone. If anything changes, I'll update this. Also, read these reviews carefully people! Some of the reviews on here are invalid. Knocking off 3 stars cause it's RM 820 and not 821? Really? And some reviews said this doesn't come unlocked? Or has the at&t; logo? Not the one I got. This one came exactly as it said above.Overall, if you're thinking about getting this phone, I definitely recommend it! It's worth the money. The pros outweigh the cons by a wide margin. I'd give it a 4.5/5 stars. It's different, try something new. A couple friends advised me not to get it cause it's a windows phone, but this is actually better than their phones (so far). Out of all the people I've shown this to, 2 people hated it. One of em hates it cause it looks too different(he also has an iphone). The other guy who hates it has had iphones/macs/ipads his entire life. He lives and dies by Apple. He'll trash anything that's not Apple. So his opinion is not valid. Haha. Ok I hope you guys enjoyed my overly long review.UPDATE 4/16/2014: So I've had this phone for about a year now. Thought I'd update this. I'm sure no one's even looking at this, cause this phone's old news now haha. Anyway, this phone held up ridiculously well over this past year. Durability is still amazing. I stopped using a screen protector and phone case for months and still has no damage to the phone, even though I dropped it a million times. A few scratches here and there, but not too noticeable. This phone is simply amazing. The apps have gotten a lot better, so I give this phone a 5/5 stars (I previously gave it 4.5/5). Overall, I think I'm gonna stay with the Lumia family for the next few years. Hopefully get their newest phones. If you actually read this, you're awesome. Stay awesome ;)", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply the Best!!", "Author": "Edgar H. Tan, MD \"The Healer\"", "ReviewID": "RG9XRZBXZ5AIW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I happen to own an AT&T; lumia 900 after I had the unlock code given by AT&T; last October 8, 2012  but soon I realized that while the screen is crisp, a lot of the screen remained unused until the day I got the windows 7.8 last January 31, 2013. The experience dramatically changed for the better with the resizeable tiles of the windows phone 8 format. I decided against buying an AT&T; locked phone because even when it has been unlocked, the hotspot function remains disabled (Disabled by AT&T;) and therefore can't be shared. There is no WCDMA-only network choice hence, so much of my connection is 2G or Edge which is so disappointingly slow. This limited connectivity held me back from upgrading to the newer lumia 920 but, I soon discovered that you can actually commit network connectivity to 3g only (equivalent to WCDMA-only) by dialing ##3282#. After that discovery, it did not take me long to get the upgraded Lumia 920. So much for the introduction I found the following positives for this Nokia lumia 920 vs 900.1. Fast response and buttery smooth operation.2. Resizeable tiles and fonts are really nice.3. The camera is heaven and earth different and much much better compared to older lumia 900.4. 3G-only connectivity can be set by dialing ##3282 on windows phone 8.5. The charging port is now below rather than on top...I love it!6. Nice crisp screen.7. Built-in wallet App is really cool. By putting your card name number, security code and expiry, it  automatically identifies your billing information and address. This is now readily available to purchase Apps.8. Whilie there maybe Apps missing windows 8 makes it easy to pin sites making it handy for access from the screen.This is my fourth generation windows phone and after having used Samsung Galaxy Nexus as my second phone as I normally carry two rather than just one, I eventually gravitated back to windows phone after I discovered how to dedicate network connectivity to 3G only. If only people will give it a shot, it is a very nice and capable OS.......if microsoft will succeed in integrating the windows market place for windows phone 8 Apps  that are  compatible with windows 8 PC OS, it will really become a force to reckon with in the future!!!I believe that the future is great for windows to shine down the road!!!", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Both Amazing and Irritating", "Author": "L. Taber", "ReviewID": "R3NHGN5VBU9QUR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Who is writing these five star reviews? Don't place much stock in them. Nobody who has spent significant time with this phone and this operating system could sincerely find this set up to be perfection. It isn't. It's not that I don't love this phone. I really do, but it has flaws, some of them glaring. This phone will amaze you. It will also annoy the heck out of you. Sometimes both in the same minute.First of all. The phone is beautiful. It's like holding a luxurious shiny candy shell filled with a luminescent pool of pure clear liquid. The display is superior to anything else out there. It's stunning and vibrant, with rich, warm color.  Even if you have a pad device you might actually choose to watch videos on your phone. The viewing experience is just that pleasurable. The onboard speakers are pretty decent too, better than iPhone. Headphones sound better than on the iPhone as well. However, you're going to have to shop far and wide to find headphones whose controls are fully functional with this phone. If you do find some good ones let me know.So this is an LTE phone. It it just me or does LTE seem inexplicably slower than 4G? AT&T; pushed me into switching data plans, and I thought it would be faster. So far disappointed in that. LTE connection is also spottier. Now I can't tell if its the LTE plan or if this phone somehow manages to burn through more data doing exactly the same activities that I did on my iPhone. Burning through 5G alarmingly fast. This could be a problem. AT&T; forces you to drop your unlimited plan to be able to use the phone as a wifi hotspot. With the iPhone that didn't seem to e a problem.Battery lifespan is deficient. And there's no way to see what is chewing up battery life. This phone needs a means to close specific apps and it does not have that. Also, the wireless charger is neat, but nothing more than a novelty item. It charges only minimally through a case so you have to take your case off to use it. It is a slow slow charge. Once your battery gets below 10% you really need to plug it into an outlet or go drive in your car. The car charges this phone the fastest by far. There was one time I placed the phone on the wireless charger and the continuous low battery notifications were draining the battery faster than it could charge. Absurd right? I had to restart the phone to shut up the notifications. Weird glitchy thing there, only happened once though.Speaking of the car, you know how you just plugged your iPhone into the USB port and out came gorgeous digital sound with songs info on the display panel? Yeah, kiss that goodbye. You have to go buy an auxiliary jack. This is a Nokia phone shortcoming, and it totally sucks balls. I hate having to settle for hissy aux sound. You also can't control the music from your steering wheel, just volume. That because every danged gizmo on the market is designed for iPhone. Don't even get me started.The app selection is lacking. I do expect that progress will be made but its not even close to being satisfactory. The major apps have mostly watery, less functional versions of their iPhone counterparts. Even ubiquitous apps like Twitter and Facebook just aren't up to snuff. Spotify doesn't have a radio playlist function on the windows phone app, and that is just inexcusable. The selection of games is disappointing but what is there is just so awesome. I got Angry Birds for free, Pop Cats, Treasures of Montezuma and Bejeweled live. Playing games on this phone is so much fun thanks to the big bright display. The phone controls feel better and more natural in your hand. I think it's fair to say that the few apps that have taken full advantage of this system are just beautiful. NBC News has a lovely app. Flixster is so pretty. ESPN Hub is nice, but I hate it that they have zero women's sports to follow. The potential to make apps that are far more visually appealing than what other phones can do justice to is totally there.What IS there and even superior is full integration of social media. At a glance you can see what your FB friends and Tweeps have been up to. You can add your favorite people to various group rooms so their activity doesn't get lost in the clutter. You can Also make family rooms to add things like pictures, messages and grocery lists that are shared only with room members. You can even make a social event of weather by adding your friends locations to the Weather Channel app. Cool. I've heard complaints about lack of notifications but haven't found this lacking in any way. There is a Me tile that collects all your notifications . I love that feature. It would be nice if the Me and People spaces had all the same functions as the apps themselves. For instance, you can't \"like\" FB replies or see all the Twitter replies.Also an awesome feature, connecting and sharing content with XBox. The smart glass is nothing more than a cheesy remote that doesn't even turn on XBox,but you can have your avatar on your phone and work on your gamerscore while you're out and about. Sweet. It's handy to make playlists on XBox music and use them on the phone later.windowsphone.com really grew on me once my first Lumia 920 bricked. Yep, after three days the original cyan model got super hot one day and inexplicably went stone cold dead the next day. AT&T; was good about replacing it. I ordered online but was able to return the phone at a store where I exchanged it for a white model that I like better anyway. The white glossy phone feels different in construct to the matte phones. It feels more solid. It slipped out of my hand and whomped hard onto my painted deck.  Chipped the deck, but once I rubbed off the red paint the phone was unscathed. I got a case anyway because the phone will slide out of your hand or slide off of a surface at some point. At any rate, the windows phone version of cloud is accessible and interactive, a refreshing change from iPhone cloud. I was able to restore my contacts, photos and apps with no problem. The back up seemed to be even too hasty to get my deleted pictures into the cloud. Embarrassing!Text editing on the phone is the best. It's easier to select and copy text. The predictive word feature is nifty. You type in \"happy\" and the bar above the keyboard suggests that the next word you might want is \"birthday\" or \"day.\" It's a great way to save time typing in pronouns, conjunctions and the like.Tap and hold is a very useful feature. This makes it easy to scroll through long lists of apps and a huge music library because if you tap on A the whole alphabet pops up. It's much better than trying to tap the microscopic alphabet on the side of the iPhone keyboard. Also, you can tap and hold the back button to see what you've looked at, and tap and hold many images within the pages to bring up available actions.Live tile is deservedly praised. It's superior in every way. You can size the tiles to emphasize what looks best, or what you like best. Updates show up on the tiles. I love it that you don't have to accumulate all those stupid pages and figure out where an app has decided to install itself. You can add as much or as little as you like to the home screen because one swipe over will take you to your alphabetical list of apps. The letters above the apps don't appear until after you have installed a certain number of apps. The whole thing is so well done.IDK how people test the iPhone 5 camera to be superior. This camera is the bees knees. The low light pics are superb. I have a black dog that I could never capture satisfactorily on iPhones, but this camera has made that dog photogenic. The colors are more authentic to how the eye sees them. Well, maybe slightly bluer. The wide assortment of filter apps you can plug in prior to shooting is sheer genius. Blink is great for pets and children.The Office programs are so so. Not horrible but not especially worthy either. Seems like a way to view and make minor edits to docs. Apples's Pages, by contrast offers everything to originate a spectacular document. No comparison.There is no equivalent mailbox to iPhone. You can add as many accounts as you like though. Not everybody likes having separate mailboxes. I do. You can place your mail tiles together on the home screen. I have four mail squares nestled together to form a bigger square. I like being able to see how many emails have arrived in each mailbox.People have griped about not having Google Maps. No clue why. This phone has world class GPS functions. That's Nokia, and they really do this well. You can get directions and maps from Nokia's Here navigator, or use the AT&T; GPS that will also help you route around traffic. You can see how fast you're going and how far you've gone. Good stuff.This is a phone where you won't get enough out of it if you don't take the time read the advice and tips Microsoft sends, or watch the various YouTube demos. Yet it's not a  tetchy or overly complex system. It's just different. I find those differences to be mostly good. The phone is aesthetically pleasing and satisfying to hold. Once you work out the system, it's a delightful happy experience to use the phone. When surfers talk about \"tasty waves\" it's kinda like that. This phone just has a bigger, better flavor. I hope Windows Phone catches on. It's worth keeping, and it does make the iPhone feel a bit frosty and old school by comparison.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "A good change!", "Author": "Paulo Villarreal Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "R17JU9ZYK97X6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just switched to this phone and I absolutely love it, I was afraid it would have tons of compatibility issues but happily it is not the case, I sync my itunes songs without any problem and the pictures it takes are stunning.

I've owned several smart phones in the last 4 years from different makers and running different OS.  This is BY FAR the best one I've owned.  First impressions:1. The camera and video functions are outstanding.  Best quality on a phone I've seen.2. Personalizing the home screen was super-easy. I organized the tiles, apps, and colors exactly how I wanted them.3. I found the apps I use most in the store and install was easy.4. I really like the skydrive connection. Having my pictures auto-upload over the data plan or WI-FI is a nice option.5. OS performance is snappy. I've not run into any lag or stuttering.  Switching apps is fast.6. I watched some TV shows via the YouTube app and it was awesome.  Watched in full HD over 4G. I know I'll be using that app a lot.7. The battery life has been solid so far.  In the first few days I had several phone calls, downloads, pictures, video, and watching videos.  In that time I ran about 32 hours on a charge.  Any time I get 24 hours + I'm happy.8.

Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree,is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Evans Jones", "ReviewID": "RSCEEMD1GH3SZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone i received earlier than i was expected,it is as described RM 821 factory unlocked.This is why i gave it five stars.I am 100% satisfied.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Richard Cox", "ReviewID": "R2I1F0QJ5XRUH0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You have to like Windows 8, or odds are you won't like this phone.

I wanted to have a mini keyboard to use this to type some notes, as it has Office and OneNote.  Both Nokia and AT&T; hide this little known fact that all keyboards are not supported with Bluetooth, as Microsoft deemed it not important I suppose.  I talked with folks at Microsoft Store, and they told me that users are just suppose to browse or touch up documents, not really create new content on the phone.There are numerous other problems (I'm sure cited by other users), and the many applications one would expect to be commonplace, either don't exist or have really flawed implementations, such as having a lot of UX design flaws and huge missing functionality.  The list is so huge, I could write a book.  One that stood out is using e-mail:  You have to configure a new  application per email (yahoo, gmail, etc.) and so it isn't integrated into one app.  Additionally, you can ONLY have one application per type of account, so if you had two Yahoo accounts (one for spam, one for friends, etc.) then you can only choose one of them.  Thus the Yahoo email app only works with one Yahoo account.So while other systems allow you to browse all your e-mail through a single application, Microsoft forces you to use a single application per e-mail account, and only one of the same account.  Essentially, Microsoft violates the path of least surprise (using what we know to work well), has poor implementation with major gaps that lack functionality, and poor user interface and experience to boot across the board, especially in e-mail.Combine this the fact that you cannot use bluetooth keyboards (or other HID devices like joysticks) despite advertising bluetooth is support (and how they all sort of hide the fact from users), this leaves a very distasteful experience...", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$282.99", "Features": "3G HSDPA 850/900/1900/2100\nDisplay - 4.5 inch screen\nStorage - 1 GB RAM, 32 GB memory\nCamera - 8.7 MP with Optical Image Stabilization and Carl Zeiss optics; short-pulse, high-power LED flash\nProcessor - 1.5 GHz dual core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor", "Name": "Nokia Lumia 920 White Factory Unlocked 32GB phone 4G LTE 800 / 900 / 1800 / 2100 / 2600 - RM-821", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ISsmkPlWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00A9LB0PO"}}
