Then after you buy it they will come out with a better one or the price will drop $20.00.I received this phone on 1/17/2014.My smartphone review or views will be influenced by just having had the LG 800 and the ZTE valet, This is a true smartphone like the ZTE valet, unlike my LG 800.I must say that I think this new entry level LG Optimus II will be very popular with tracfone users.This is a review on the phone and not on Tracfone,Verizon or Amazon,some other reviews cover them.Lets start out with the larger screen,it does make a difference,there is more area to work with.I put both the the valet and the LG optimus II on the local channel 10 TV app  and you could see the difference the larger, clearer  3.8inch  screen has made reading the small print. Even the tabs you tap on (News-Weather-Sports) were a tad larger.I could read the print easier, it just looked a little truer color to me also than the ZTE valet.You  will need a screen saver (protector)on this phone,being a entry level phone.  I am seeing some lite fine scratches from not using a screen saver on both of my LG39Cs.Virtual Qwerty Keyboard >I am  really enjoying the stock virtual qwerty keyboard a lot and it does seem to help predict many words that it thinks that I am looking for in some instances there could be 5 or 6  ideas of what it thinks I want to say just above the keyboard when I type the letter T, or there are these arrows at each end, and if I touch or tap the arrow many other choices appear,see below.This is a (poor) example( < those them this the to there their > )Or it will try to finish the sentence for me,or just use the talk to text feature.The key buttons are a little larger in landscape mode.If you are not happy with the keyboard board that comes with the phone you can get a app like SwiftKey Keyboard (which I like) from the google play store. Swype Keyboard is another one but I have not used it.The phone has just English and Espanol for the languages. But if use the LG keyboard and tap the little gear wheel next to (123?) and the space bar it has many languages.If you do not see the gear wheel look in comments section to see how to get to it.> Thanks to John M. Steward Jr.  (Page 25 in user guide).The phone is very sleek and thin,very pleasant to look at,fits nicely in your hand but be aware it is very very slippery without some kind of gel-cover or case around it.Be very careful not to drop it until they start coming out with some cases to fit this phone,something to give it some grip in your hand when holding it. The case or cover will also cut back on the scratches, fingerprints from the high gloss black back cover and give it some protection.Update, phone just feels better in my hand with case on it.There are four NO Backlit capacitive touch buttons or keys at the bottom of the phone for the( >Back Key >Home Key,>Menu Key,>Recent App Key ).The keys are highly reflective which  may or may not help in some cases to see them, but not having the lighted touch buttons was a big disappointment.You do have very quick positive feedback from the touch buttons and buttons or tabs on the screen > Could this be because of the larger screen area has made the buttons or tabs larger and easier to touch?Everything seems to work smoother, more responsive, better than the valet  which I really like and am still using. Update> We retired the Valet 3/1/2004 and transferring everything went well.They both just have 512 ram and  are entry level phones so make sure you do not over load it with too many apps....And be forewarned a lot of the apps are not made or designed to go on the SD card.512 ram.4GB micro SD card installed and will take up to a 32Gb.1.78GB TOTAL internal storage.1.0GHz single core processors.Android 4.1 Jelly Bean operating system.3G Network Speed.I am not seeing any of the problems that plagued the LG38c.The phone uses the (Verizon Network ONLY )....There is ( No Roaming )....This phone is a CDMA type so it ( Does not use SIM cards )Note you can go to tracfones web site and put your zip code in and it will tell you if the androids (Smartphones) will work for you.Then ask someone in your area that has a phone with  verizon service how it is working for them to be safe.The phone has bluetooth to (transfer your contacts or sync to your car) and GPS to find your way around, ( they both work very well ) on this entry level phone.This is what comes with the phone, back cover, battery, a wall charger, USB data/charging cable, 4GB microSD card installed, instructions on how to activate.The TRACFONE APP from google play store is one way to check your balance and service date and to add mins and data time. It is a free app from the google play store. The one that comes with this phone now is called ( My Account Downloader ) found in with your apps on your phone. They both do the same thing.Try the one that comes with the phone first and if you can not get it to work get the one at the google play store. Make sure you have wifi or data on first before checking.A lot of people miss the old way that was always shown on the phone.MEMORY > Comes with a 4GB micro SD card installed and will take up to a 32Gb.1.78GB TOTAL internal storage. The valet beats the LG a little in internal memory, see below.I have tried to have both phones set up the same in the amount of apps, pictures, contacts things like that to be fair or even.I counted 14 apps that I have added plus what came on the phones .1.78GB TOTAL internal storage on the ( LG Optimus Dynamic II ) OUT OF THE BOX. I have 1.2GB free left on the (LG dynamic II). Thats  after I added 14 apps on to what was there already.2.34GB TOTAL internal storage on the ( ZTE valet ) OUT OF THE BOX. I have 1.7GB free left on the ( ZTE valet ). Thats  after I added 14 apps on to what apps was there already.You can change the white background color behind the collection of your apps ,I myself did not like the white background.The stock ringtones are so so,I like the Business Ringtones app byRCP Ringtones at the google play store so well that I am spoiled.*If this is all new to you use your quick settings bar,you may know it as the (power bar or widget)to turn the data off when your not online using it so you don't use it all up.You will wonder where all your data went to.)Data can be used to go on line when you are not using your (free) WiFi. The(power bar,widget)that came with the ZTE valet to turn the (Data, Wi-Fi, Sync, GPS, Bluetooth)on and off and to adjust the screen brightness )has a different home on the LG,it is up in the notification window and has some added features there also.LG is calling this the ( Quick Settings bar ).The bar has a edit feature so you can put what you want to in the first box or wherever .*Note you will have to have your data on to send or receive a picture or any attachment in a text message.The quick settings bar has a neat feature called(Quick Memo)where you can write a short word or draw a (circle) (arrow) with your finger on the page that you are on and then make a screenshot of that page and save it. It says in the manual not to use your fingernail make sure you use the tip of your finger to write with....The wi-fi works very well, much better than the zte valet,that was a knock on the valet some people had.BATTERY---> The battery took a hour and a half to charge when it was at 18 percent capacity to full charge. I like the battery meter on the LG it shows the percentage that it is at and when it is charging it shows the the little lightning bolt in motion unless the screen is asleep and then you can not see or tell if it is charging. Make sure to keep (GPS,WiFi,Sync,Bluetooth) off when you can to save you battery.The battery just will not last as long as your old style tracfones because there are just too many features to play with. Three days at the best for myself.I miss the camera flash that the ZTE valet had that I used for a  flashlight by installing an app from the google app store. The flash was useless for taking pictures on the valet tho...The camera on the LG is a disappointment using it indoors just like it was on the valet. It does do better outdoors in good light.3/5/14 update > Outdoor pictures doing very well.I like where you can say a word like > Cheese, Smile, Whiskey to take the picture and that works very very well. The valet had a shutter button like a real camera on the outside of the phone.*Call strength---> I do notice that like the ZTE valet I do not have as many signal bars as I did on my other older tracfones but I can use this phone where the others would not work and have not dropped any calls..So what I am trying to say here is that I can call and talk just about anywhere I go West Va - Ohio - Ky.*On this phone maybe---> 1 to 3 bars and my others phones I would have 3 and 4 bars...) > This was from my ZTE valet review and holds true with this phone. At my house I just have 1 or 2 bar most of the time.The good >1.0GHz single core processor,good for a tracfone.A nice looking clear 3.8inch screen,really nice for a tracfone.Android 4.1 Jelly Bean  operating system,good for a tracfone.Comes with a 4GB micro sd card installed. will take up to a 32Gb. I have the SanDisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSDHC Class 10,the 10 class is probably a little over kill here.Quick memo where you can write with your finger on the page that you are on and then make a screenshot of that page and save it.The bad or not that good >Battery life,depends on what features you keep turned on and how you you use your phone.Three days at best for me.The cameras indoor pictures. Outdoor pictures do very well.Some one in a review said that they missed the notification light on the ZTE valet in the upper top of phone for missed calls and battery charging.No flash on the camera that you could make a flash light with by using a app.No Backlit home back menu keys,the keys are highly reflective tho.There are differences in all of these smart phones from tracfone, price, features and you have to choose what items you want and like the best.If you are coming from a high end phone (or expecting one) you may not be happy, ( These are I think ENTRY LEVEL PHONES ), there are about 5  of them.For the teens one has a FM radio.Tip----> Have your kids buy you time cards, google play cards and data cards for fathers day, mothers day, birthdays and xmas.TEENS---> you could use this same reasoning with Mom,Dad,Grandpa,Grandma,Aunts and Uncles I would think.I bought my first tracfone in 1998, I seen it in a jeep magazine and took it out west to Leadville,Co.and was shocked how well it worked.To get repeat reminders of a missed calls,messages I downloaded(Alert me Pro Missed Call Text) from the google app store.I have norton anti-malware(free)app and it works great, It always checks every new app I install and if the phone updates a app it checks that also. AVG Mobile is another good security app.You get these apps at the google play store.Tip---> Read the(Questions & Answers)pages on the LG Optimus Dynamic II and the ZTE valet, there are a lot of questions answered there that might help.I know that H.Pham,( G.Graham has helped me on this phone page more times than I can count) and others there have helped me and others many times on the ZTE Valet page. Read and look over the other reviews that others have taken the time to share with you.

My old phone, a Samsung slider, was wearing out after 3 years. I wanted a smartphone because having data and apps is a lot more useful. You are lugging the thing around, why not have the camera, the music player, the GPS tracker, maps, TV Guide, whatever?It works on wifi so most of your data can come from wifi, not minutes. The deal is this, It's triple time but data is one minute = one MB of data. Not much data. But there's more. You can buy minutes and you have to maintain 'days', but if you have days in your bank, you can buy MBs of data with no days or minutes attached. It is getting a little complicated. Basically, data costs about 2.6 cents if you buy it direct. Minutes are more, even though they are tripled.I figure you do not want to use much data with this phone, but if you use small amounts, maybe 500 mb a month, it's a good deal. First off, it's Verizon, but it's the old 3G network. Good and broad, but slow. The 500 MB of data costs about $13 a month, and the phone time, the days, plus another 100 minutes runs maybe $8 a minute with a year card, to give you the days. That's $20 a month and nothing is that cheap that I could find. Remember, the huge advantage of Trac is that the minutes and the data roll over as long as you have days. Most data just evaporates on the renewal day. The nature of this phone makes it hard to eat up a lot of minutes. Stay away from video.You don't want to waste the data. My advice is to turn it off if you don't need it. You can end up using data if the wifi goes down, or something like that. Just turn it off and turn it one only when you need it, if you want to protect your data in the bank.The phone is low resolution, which hurts web browsing. You should use apps for news, weather, etc. You can surf the web, but set the screen to rotate. The mail apps are good. If you have Gmail and other Google services you get them with ease.The camera is nothing special though bright sun pix are OK. You can shoot pictures for emails or to show how you took something apart.The are a lot of fun apps like My Tracks from Google. It used the GPS to track you when you walk, run, bike, etc. It shows a map of where you want, how fast, and even how many calories. Free. Just download.Smartphones are fun and this phone puts it within reach of more people Learn how to not waste you data, and you'll get a lot for a little. The phone as a phone seemed to be OK, but I don't have much experience. These are quick impressions, just because I like Trac and this is a nice addition to what they do. They do things their way, but a lot of it works if you are the right kind of customer. The rollover data is great.Update:There is one glitch with this phone, with a simple solution. If you hold the phone in your left hand, dial voice mail, and try to enter you password, the screen blacks and it is hard to finish the entry. If you hold the phone in your right hand, and use your left hand (fingers) to enter the codes, it works. There's a proximity sensor or something that blanks the screen, but I'm not sure.There is a big advantage to a basic smartphone. It is impossible to use a lot of data if you keep it simple. I took the phone to the emergency room and ended up in care facilities for 3 weeks. I used this phone and it was fine. I ended up using a tiny amount of data for everything, mail, weather, searches, news, sports. I'm not talking any video, anything streaming.My only gripe is that Verizon to renting off their 3g network and it is not what it was. So it seems to be slow and weak almost everywhere I go. It works, but I have an LTE device I sometimes use, and it is more universal now, by far. Verizon is playing games with the 3g making it seem like it is something like the high cost network. I don't think so. It is more like Sprint where you get it where you get it (cities and highways) and then you don't. And a lot of times it is slow.I had a Tracfone flipfone before this, and the difference is huge. I'm using so little data the cost is barely worth worrying about, maybe a few bucks a month. The smartphone is a better phone. I use it in speaker mode and hold it in front of me.If you want a phone with a lot of functionality on the web, the premium stuff is the way to go. If you want a lot of apps, this phone will bog down. But this phone is much smaller than a premium smartphone, so it really is more of a phone with advanced data features. You'll still have music to listen to. I've read Kindle books. If you put 10 gigs of music on the SD card, it will slow the start up, adding at least 5 minutes.Updated May 9, 2014", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice phone despite Tracfone's new cost of texting.", "Author": "Darronius", "ReviewID": "R28LMZ0KZZUE3T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this phone for my wife to replace her LG800. Although a good phone, she'd had enough of the tiny screen and keyboard.Phone arrived and it looks great. Entire face, even over bottom nav buttons is glass, feels solid, high quality and graphics look crisp and vivid (especially compared to old phone.) UI feels snappy.  Was nicer than I had expected for the price. Charged it up with the included cable, and using tracfone's site was able to activate this phone and transfer old number and her 2000+ minutes over without problem. Set up home wifi - browsing the web and adding new apps was very easy and looked great. Wifi reception was good throughout the house. Websites render nice on the included chrome browser (you can also add Firefox from the google play store if you want.)At this point though, we realized texting and voice was not working. All attempts to troubleshoot failed. Ended up having to open a ticket with tracfone and within 3 hours we received a call from a support agent. After a few minutes of back and forth, the issue was fixed on their end and texts started rolling in. All was working well. One thing to remember is that at home, work, etc, wifi will provide you with free data, but voice and txts will still use your phone's minutes.Due to the android OS, the phone is very customizable and simple to figure out. Comes installed with few gigs of internal storage and another 4GB microSD Card pre-installed that you can replace with a larger if you wish. The camera is so-so. Better than the LG800 but still pretty low end. Outside use results are good but indoor is grainy and dark - there is no flash and it is only 3mp. Phone battery life seems good.One short thing: You must add a \"Your Account\" app from the play store to be able to check your minutes, etc on phone. It doesn't work too well for us. The two app tabs show different information and tracphone feels the need to send several duplicate txts as a follow up with the same info eating up your store of texts. At this point, it works much better to just check your info on their website.Overall it was a good purchase for my wife's needs. She is able to significantly upgrade for a low price and keep her minutes and 10 months left on account. Besides what seems to be growing pains in Tracfone's adoption of these Android phones (trouble with the app widget and issues getting the voice and sms to work) this phone was a good purchase.Now my reason for removing one star from this phone: Tracfone's new minutes plan, and specifically the cost of each sms txt message. The old phones used one meter for voice and texts. The plan for these Android phones uses 3 separate tanks for voice, texts, and data. Sounds good on the surface, but the cost of sending a sms message used to be .33 minutes. Now it is a full minute. Since the carrot these phones advertise is triple minutes, your one-year 400 minute card will give you 1200 texts a year. This averages to 3.25 texts a day. For most of us who text more than voice, this isn't going to work. My own tracfone is up for renewal in 44 days and also want to go android (also currently have LG800). When txts cost .33, a year card lasted all year for me. Now I'd have to buy two - twice as much $$ for tracfone. Understand why they changed the plan this way, but it will likely send me to another provider. Yes, there are a few other very good options for no-contract phones if you search around.So since everyone's personal use is different, if my last gripe doesn't have an effect on your typical usage, this phone is a great option for the price.-----------------2\\13\\14 Update: Read a few places that the case for the LG Optimus L4 II / E440 would also fit this phone. Unfortunately, while the camera and all the buttons do line up, the case is a little big. We purchased one of the gel snap-ons for like $3.00, so no big deal. Phone snaps in ok but slides around. Still looking for a case. I'm sure soon they'll be out if not already. I'll upload a pic.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Do not buy unless you are in Verizon's Home Network", "Author": "JK", "ReviewID": "R3GKDW5U5KM1RN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Please keep in mind my review is more geared towards Tracfone service with this phone, and not a review of  the phone itself.I'm a 7 year user of traditional (non-smart) Tracfones. I decided now that Tracfone is offering Android devices, and after punching my zipcode into their website, it was determined they would work in my area, so I decided it was time for an upgrade.After receiving my phone, I followed the directions to transfer my number, my old phone quit working, then it came time to activate my new phone. It would not activate using the instructions of calling *22890. When calling that number it stated \"this call cannot be completed as dialed\".I called Tracfone support and after several hours of powering phone off, do this, do that, it was determined the phone must be defective. So I returned it to Amazon, and purchased another model Android phone. After receiving this phone, it would still not activate, and spent a couple more hours on the phone with elevated tech support.Now, I'm finally at Level 3 support, and they have a carrier network engineer (for Verizon, since that is the service these phones operate) on the other end. I was told drive a few miles from my home zip code, activate it, then all would be good.I proceeded to do this, and after returning to my home zip code, I could receive calls, but when making calls, all I got was a message \"please re-enter the phone number and do not press send\". I had to do this for every outgoing number.After researching further online, and no help from Tracfone support, I found out I'm living in a area that Verizon does not consider a \"home network\". But still showed me as having service in their extended network.So to sum all this up, unless you live in the Verizon \"Home Network\", you will not be able to activate your phone, and if you do travel to an area to activate it, and return home, it will be extra steps to make outbound calls because you are essentially roaming on someone else cell towers.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Tracfone without a doubt", "Author": "Craig M.", "ReviewID": "R2VFXC7D9EXSKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before buying the LG39C, I was going to buy the ZTE Valet. But the mixed reviews about the poor wifi that plagued the ZTE led me to this phone. Luckily, the wifi is much better on this and well worth the extra $50. The added screen size makes the phone comparable with a lot of the large phones that android runs on. Speaking of Android, the phone runs an LG version of Android 4.1.2 Jellybean, which is only one Android version away from the latest Android KitKat.Being pampered by my quad-core overclocked tablet, the phone was a step down in performance, but the small resolution helped make up for the lack of rendering power. Benchmarks from Antutu never rose above 5000, despite some kernel tweaks. The phone was VERY easy to root and xposed framework works well if that interests anyone. That's another thing that puts the LG39 above the ZTE Valet.The battery life is subpar in my opinion. Despite my wakelock monitoring, I can't seem to get the phone to stop draining battery. Overnight, it drained about 40%, so keeping it off or plugged in seems necessary. The screen is bright enough the see in the sunlight and dark enough to watch at night. LG's brightness slider is very useful in the place it is.One of the annoying things about holding the phone is that there is nothing to hold onto. The plastic backing slips right out of your hand, and holding the edges may cause some accidental presses on the attractive, but small bezel. The buttons in the bottom really should have been backlit, but after using it for a few days, I have memorized their locations anyways.The phone only has 512MB of RAM, which presents a problem for many apps. Don't expect to by playing 3D apps with no lag. I strongly suggest installing the app \"Greenify\". Unlike regular task killers which kill apps and then let them start up again, Greenify kills the app, and then keeps it suspended until the next time it is started up. It can be run without root, but works best with. Most 2D apps will work fine and smoothly.Personally, I'm not a fan of all the LG apps, so I replaced them with the stock Android (nexus) versions. These apps included the Gallery, Camera, Browser, Calculator, Keyboard, etc. The camera quality was OK outdoors, but indoors it got increasingly grainy as the amount of light decreased. Three megapixels isn't a lot, but it is enough for Facebook or twitter. The LG keyboard is missing gesture input, so the Google Keyboard from the Play Store was one of the first few apps to install.One important thing is to keep Data off unless it is needed. You can watch your data usage in the settings under \"Mobile Data\". Just leaving data in for an hour can result in many units being used because of things like email syncing or apps updating. Restrict as many apps from using background mobile data as possible. The Data is only 3G speed, so it won't go very fast, but prolonged use will be expensive.The Tracfone app actually works on this phone. By works, I mean the bare minimum of working. The only good thing it does is send a free text that gives you the amount of minutes, texts, and data you have left. The app and widget itself often fail to update when you add units even though they have been added you your account and reflect the balance that is sent via text. Because of the new units system, using an app to text over WiFi may be beneficial to some people. As always, data, texts, and minutes carry over from each card entered.Another thing to remember is to move apps to the SD card often. You can do that by clicking on an App in settings and pressing \"Move to SD card\". The internal storage is only 1.7 GB free, and that will fill up quickly. You are given a 4GB SD card, so use it wisely.Overall, the phone itself is very good. Google's project butter has increased the speed of the phone to stand up to the very expensive multicore models. I have not had any major problems with it, and most problems I have had were fixed after I rooted it and brought it up to speed.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Currently the best TracFone branded Android you can get - I like it!", "Author": "Just Me", "ReviewID": "R3FNPW9WY05GFO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I like the Dynamic II a lot - I definitely recommend it. Secondly, keep in mind it's a sub $100 phone so it's not going to run 500 apps at the same time or have a super duper high resolution screen. Its specs are just fine and pair well with TracFone's pay as you go Android rates.Pros: - 3.8\" screen is large enough, yet compact and is nice enough - Android 4.1 out of the box (no need to root or flash custom ROMs) - EXCELLENT WiFi performance - Good quality and loud speaker - Decent battery life - Good onboard storage, plus included 4GB microSDCons: - Slippery housing, hard to find cases - 4:3 aspect screen makes the phone short and wide - 3MP camera is fixed focus, and no flash (so no barcode scanning or mobile deposit) - 1GHz single-core CPU and 512MB ram is a bit barebones, but sufficient - No auto brightness - NO BACKLIT CAPACTIIVE BUTTONS! What was LG thinking?!Initial impressions:I like it. For $99, I feel it's worth the money. The 4:3 aspect screen is a bit weird for a phone, I prefer 16:9. 4:3 is basically wider and shorter (think more like a square) while 16:9 is longer and narrower, like a rectangle - 16:9 is what most all phones are these days. A larger screen would definitely be helpful, but 3.8\" is fine. The Dynamic II's resolution is a bit low so some text/pictures may look a little rough around the edges, but still very usable.Speed/responsiveness:I know some are concerned that the single core 1GHz CPU and 512MB of RAM will be a huge downgrade from say, the Droid X2 which is dual-core. Honestly, I feel that the Dynamic II is more responsive. I have a feeling that may be Android 4.1 being more efficient with its resources than 2.3 on my X2. It is no speed demon but I'm happy. Runs my usuals just fine - Instagram, HoFo, TuneIn Pro, Dropbox, WordFeud etc.Reception:Very good. WiFi reception is exceptional. It's the best out of all my phones, including my $600 LG G2. I've read numerous times that the TracFone ZTE Valet Android phone has terrible WiFi reception, which to me is a deal breaker because you'll want to be on WiFi whenever possible to save on your mobile data - having crappy WiFi can make that difficult. Verizon (the underlying network TracFone uses for this phone) is excellent in my area so I didn't expect any problems with call quality and haven't had any. Do note that data speeds and reception will vary depending on your particular area. Ask friends/family on Verizon how their service is before purchasing this phone to get an idea of how well it will work.Battery life could always use improvement but I find it will last two days with light use - one day of heavy use. It has a bunch of the little features my G2 has, like pop-up notification for messages (when you're in another app) and QuickMemo. You will HAVE TO memorize which capacitive button is where if you will use the phone in the dark. They are not backlit (huge mistake by LG) so it's impossible to see in the dark. They are reflective so during most everyday use, you'll be able to see them.Any questions, feel free to ask in the comments. I've had TracFone for almost 15 years, back when it was $20 for 30 minutes - ha! My needs have changed so I use an iPhone 5S and LG G2 on T-Mobile, but I have kept my always-reliable TracFone service as an extra line.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly Excellent Phone!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"artist, animal communicator\"", "ReviewID": "R5QBQ2C1TJT7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If I had had money to burn I would have gotten the biggest, baddest phone ever. I would have loved a state-of-the-camera and all the fancy stuff.Now to reality. I am a Tracfone user. I cannot see paying huge monthly bills and in fact cancelled ATT years ago.  A while back a friend gave me his old Iphone 3GS and I used it as a mini tablet and had a blast. I learned what these devices could do and wished I could use it as a phone as well, but would not pay $100.00 plus per month for the priviledge. I did end up buying a Nook HD+ on huge sale and I am using it now to write this review. But I have missed having a camera on it and it has no 3G connection.Enter Tracfone Androids. I was tickled when they started offering Android phones, but each phone seemed to have problems according to user reviews. Finally the LG Optimus Dynamic II came out. Its Operating System was a little newer, the screen was a little bigger, the camera was still crummy but I still refuse to spend hundreds on a phone. I looked into CDMA phones for the BYOP program, but couldn't find anything new that appealed to me. So I took a deep breath and ordered the LG39C.I am thrilled with this phone! The touch screen is responsive and fast. It does not have the dead pixels that the Iphone and the Nook HD+ have. The screen is bigger than the Iphone, but small enough that the lack of resolution is not a big issue. The voice quality is excellent here in Southern CA. The more I use it and learn how it works, the more pleased I am with it.I put in a 32G microsd card and I move all the apps I can to that. This keeps the system from being bogged down. I am not a gamer so I can't address that.  I have added the following apps to boost the functionality of this phone:  barcode readers--pic2shop and HP Code Scan (they make up for the fixed focus camera and allow you to actually read barcodes with this phone); EBook Droid to read PDF files. I may add Adobe Reader also--just because--these apps work well and the EBook Droid is faster than Adobe actually; MX Player to play Flash Videos--still have to test that one but it gets good reviews; Gospel Library--excellent app for us Sunday School teachers and for scripture reading and research in general; the Weather Channel--not sure if I really need that but it works; ES File Explorer because it has been helpful on my Nook. The Tracfone app--My Account Downloader doesn't work. I just get an error message. There's a widget that appeared at the top of one of my screens that I click on that downloads this information, but I think it's loopy too, because it says I have 3 million plus text messages remaining? It's humorous really. So I haven't figured out a good way to check those yet. You can just go online to get that info and on wifi it's free. If anyone has an app killer they really like, please let me know. So far I am only reading mixed reviews.To update and clarify, the Tracfone app you get from the Google Play Store does work.  It's the one that comes pre-installed on the LG39C that doesn't work--at least for me.  The widget still confuses me. I think the number beside the \"minutes\" label is a phone number, but I'm not sure. I am new to this phone.The wifi connects faster than my Nook and the 3G connection is just fine. I turn off my data by swiping my stylus from the top right of the screen down. There are plenty of controls there where you can turn on and off your wifi, data, gps, bluetooth. The bluetooth is excellent as well. It pairs very easily with other devices. It's also lovely to have GPS built into the phone. As other reviewers have said, it is a good idea to turn off the connections you don't need to save the battery and to make sure you don't use up your data MB's.Since I have never had an upscale phone or a \"popular\" tablet, I can't compare this phone to such devices. However, the touch screen works better than the old Iphone and I find it more pleasant to use.  I have a DSLR so I would never expect a phone camera to have the autofocus speed or the low light capability of a stand-alone camera. My old camera can do things these phone cameras simply cannot do because their sensors are too small, although I know technology is advancing.Another edit and addition:  There are cases and screen protectors that fit this phone perfectly. The Illumishield works fine. And as for the case, I got the one with the silly owl on it from Cellular Outfitter on Amazon. Okay. I was in a goofy mood and I decided to not be conservative for a change. I like the case and now my groovey phone is protected. You even get a midget stylus that connects to the microphone jack. Pretty cool. I love toys.I guess that's it for now. Hope this helps someone.

Here are some advantages and tips about this phone that others may want to know before they buy.- It has a modern version of the Android operating system.  I love that I can touch the microphone on the main screen and say things like \"how do I get to the nearest eyeglass store\" or \"what is the weather going to be like tomorrow in _____\" and it tells me instantly.  I love this.- GPS works and does not have to use your Data plan:  I like to tell the phone where I want to go while on Wifi, before I leave the house.  I then start the navigation, keep my Data off, and GPS navigates me to my destination without using any MBs.  Terrific.- Wifi signal is strong.  I have a 3 story townhouse and it works on all 3 levels.- The ability to turn off background functionality on apps so as not to use much Data while on the road.  I've instructed everything except my messaging services to use foreground data only.  In other words, things I enter directly or specifically ask of my phone while out of range of Wifi.  All other updates only happen when I am near Wifi, and the settings let me control all of that.  By doing so, the phone has only used about 1MB of data that could not be specifically attributed to something I did in the foreground, in the 3 days I have had it.  So background updates and checks using the Data plan can be held to a minimum.- If you already have a Google account, you are going to be racing out of the gate as soon as you get this phone.  I put in my Google password, and it brought in all of my contacts effortlessly, all of my music from Google Play can be streamed, and my email and YouTube account were up and running in seconds.  Fantastic!- It has bluetooth, and I paired it to my car stereo in 30 seconds.  It imported all of my contacts to the stereo, and I am calling people hands free.- The battery is fairly impressive - I have been playing with it off and on for the last few days and had to charge it after 2 days of use.  I've heard many people have to charge smartphones every day so it was nice that it retained much of its battery overnight and while I was out of the house with it.I am really impressed that I get to do all this and continue to pay the $8 a month that I paid with my flip-phone.  It's amazing.

I would have loved to have purchased an Iphone but either the Iphone price was too high or the service provider was way too expensive each month. I have used Tracphone for a number of years using good old flip phones etc. I read the reviews on all of their smart phones and determined that the LG39C sounded good. I decided to purchase from Amazon since it was slightly less money than directly from Tracphone. Amazon ships via FedEx and the package came via smartpost which I did not care for. There is no way to track the package and it did take a while to get to Wisconsin, this is the only reason for the four stars.This is my first smartphone and needless to say I am blown away by its performance. The phone was quite easy to set up despite its complexity and Tracphone has both excellent tutorials and manuals on their website. Using the tutorials and the manuals I was up and running with most of the basics very quickly. The transferring of my old phone number through Tracphone was very easy and despite Tracphone warning that it may take 24hrs it only took perhaps 2hrs to transfer number and minutes etc. When I purchased the phone I bought a 32g micro SD card and installed it immediately because lots of the apps can be downloaded onto the card saving valuable phone memory. I downloaded the Tracphone app to provide me with usage information and despite some negative reviews I found it works GREAT! The app is much better than the time scrolling across the screen like the old flip phone. I also found it was easy to transfer the phone numbers and photos via Bluetooth from my old phone. Bluetooth also works wonderfully well with our Chevy vehicle, unlike my old phone it automatically connects when I start the vehicle.The main reason for a phone of course are the phone calls. I am not on the phone very often so the need to call people is quite limited but the times I used it were easy. I find here in SE Wisconsin the service (using Verizon) is great however as yet we have not gone out of the area. If we go out of the area and if I have a problem I will add to this review....so far so good. The texting is great and I like when you can turn the phone to allow you to get a bigger keyboard making it easier to text. Despite me having big fingers I can still handle the keys much better then my previous phone.I have found the Wifi to be excellent, I found that I get a strong signal on our home wifi upstairs in our bedroom and also outside within 50ft or so of our house. I downloaded a wifi locator app and it makes it a snap to connect with outside wifi setups. I also downloaded the Lookout security system just to be on the safe side.It is early days yet, a lot of things can happen when we purchase electronic devices but I am pleased. I read lots of reviews on many smartphones and after a great deal of research determined this phone was worth the risk and I bought it........I.recommend this phone especially to first time buyers like me. Since there does not appear to be a ready made cover made for this phone I took advantage of a previous review who suggested to use a Einzige slim fit LG Optimus L4 cover.

And for the first time since I started using \"pay as you go\" mobile phones, I finally get a signal at my house! (I live in a fairly rural area). Was also able to send all my contacts via Bluetooth from the old phone to this one - yay! Took a little while to figure it out, but it worked.This is my first foray into the world of smart-phones & I am enjoying getting to know & use this one. The touch-screen is so much better than the old LG800G I had (w/ Net10) & works the way I imagined a good touch-screen should. The 3 separate pools for Talk-time, Data & Texts is a bonus & I can carry-over from month to month. The camera is only 3 Megapixels, but is actually an improvement over the old \"non-smart\" phone I was using & the images aren't terrible at all. A little hard to find where the pictures live when connecting to my computer via USB, though. Also cannot back-up contacts to the computer via USB (darn).I do have to keep extra features like Bluetooth, 3G Data & Wi-Fi turned off when not in use to conserve the battery, otherwise I'd have to charge it a lot more frequently. Playing graphics-intensive games can also eat up battery time. This isn't a huge problem as it encourages me to keep aware of what features I have turned on, although I sometimes forget I don't have a feature turned on when checking my air-time or pairing w/ my Bluetooth device.I downloaded the Tracfone app to keep track of my balances for talk-time, Data & Texts, although I do wish they would just have that info easily available on the home screen (as on their other conventional phones), as one has to connect through either Wi-Fi or 3G Data to obtain this info. Same applies to adding air-time cards/PINs. You _have_ to be connected through either Wi-Fi or 3G to add airtime.Setting the phone up was a reasonable process, but took some time & had to get a little assistance from Tracfone customer service. For once, the person on the other end spoke perfect English & resolved things quickly. My old phone number also transferred painlessly & quickly.Overall, I am enjoying this phone, although I wish the battery would last a bit longer when extra features are turned on. Downloading apps, etc is fairly easy & painless & there are many free apps & games available. I'm still blown away at being able to watch YouTube on the device - very cool.A good deal (very reasonable price) on Amazon.com - well worth the money I spent on it & the accessories I also purchased (case, holster, screen protector & Bluetooth device). An excellent introduction to the world of smart-phones for those who have never had one.

Wiersch", "ReviewID": "R1UC2VHYE3QFEI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my favorite Tracfone ever. Finally a real smartphone that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I bought two, one for me and one for my wife, and even my wife is happy (and she is hard to please).I've been using Tracfone for years to save money, and have saved thousands of dollars doing so. I finally decided to bite the bullet and get a real smartphone and this seemed to get the best reviews out of the currently available smartphones from Tracfone. Previously I had the LG 840G.There's a lot of information in the other reviews, so I just want to go over things that stand out for me or that I think would be especially helpful to people reading this review.* THIS IS A LOW END ANDROID UNIT. It is reasonably fast doing basic things, but large, bloated, and inefficient apps and web browsing can bog it down. It only has a single core processor, which is low-end tech in this day and age. If you expect a low-end smartphone then you probably won't be disappointed.* Unfortunately the camera has trouble \"scanning\" UPC codes. It can't seem to focus close enough to get a good image because it has a fixed focus lens (no auto-focus). This was one of my bigger disappointments. I was able to scan some larger bar codes though, so it does work for those, but it's not as easy as I was hoping it would be. I was hoping to use the scanning feature of the Amazon app to scan bar codes when I'm out shopping to pull up prices and reviews but it looks like this won't be possible.* Fortunately scanning QR codes seems to work better. I recommend downloading \"QR Droid\" from the Play Store. It will tell you that scanning bar codes are not supported for this phone due to this phone not supporting auto-focus... but fortunately it will scan QR codes.* Transferring my service days and minutes from my previous Tracfone was easy and quick using the website. Just make sure you use the right option if you're upgrading from another Tracfone - which is to transfer your number from one Tracfone to another Tracfone... and of course, follow all the directions carefully.* One of the first apps you may want to get from the Google Play Store is the \"TracFone My Account\" app that will tell you how many minutes, texts, and MB of data you have left. I also added its widget to one of my home screens. The widget will easily show how many minutes, texts, and MB you have left and you can press the widget's \"UPDATE BALANCE\" button then wait a bit for a text to come in with your latest balance info.* The screen size is nice, but the resolution is \"low end\" at 320x480 (it's certainly no \"retina\" display) but otherwise quality is good.* I've had no issues with the WiFi. It works well.* The buttons below the screen are not backlit... but it's not that big of a deal when you get used to it and know where they are from memory.* I don't like the separate accounting for talking minutes and for texts. I think the separate accounting for data makes sense, but it would have been nice (and simpler) if they kept the voice minutes and texting together instead of separating them out.* I like the Google keyboard better so I downloaded it to replace the included LG keyboard. It seems a little faster too.* I like the easy access to important options - by swiping down from the top. You can quickly block or unblock 3G data usage, as well as do a lot of other things like adjust brightness and control features like Bluetooth, WiFi, airplane mode, sound (silent or vibrate), etc.* It only has 512MB RAM and 2GB internal memory, but it comes with a 4GB card and is expandable to 32GB (by removing the 4GB card and replacing it with a 32GB card). 2GB should be fine for a few basic apps. If you need a lot of apps or some big ones, you may be able to move a lot of stuff to the SD card if you go to settings, pull up the app, and select the option to move it.* I am finding that I have to watch the battery charge on this phone more than my previous phone... the battery doesn't seem to last as long, and since it's a smartphone, you may find yourself using it a lot more which will require more charging.* BE CAREFUL! This phone may make you want a higher end phone. I wish I could have a Galaxy S3 or better.... but I can't justify the additional $$$ it would cost, especially for the service.* Check certain online shopping stores that start with \"Q\" and end with \"VC\" for deals. I paid about $130 for mine (+ shipping), but that came with some accessories and a lot of airtime (a year)... someone who doesn't use their phone that much might get the phone plus an entire year of service for that price. Where else can you get a real smartphone with a year of service for $130 plus shipping?I'll update this review with more as things come up.Overall 4 stars, but I did consider giving it 5 (and I still might but the lack of barcode scan capability stops me).. it is a very good phone for the money even though it does bog down with some stuff.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best value on a speedy little smartphone", "Author": "howard l.", "ReviewID": "RMNBO60JIUCIL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Impressive, overall...but the learning curve and  optimizing system resources are confusing.  Also, when I first got the phone, it sometimes wouldn't quickly power on but now it does every time.When first powered up, I expected to get a home screen and start playing with icons...instead, I was confronted with a bunch of setup pages asking me info I didn't have (Gmail and Wifi passwords, etc).  Gmail is simple, but setting up/accessing other email accounts is a disaster.Only 1.78 GB user-available internal storage.  Take note of the size of downloaded apps/games because, on top of everything else Android tries to put in there, you'll quickly find storage maxing out and performance affected.  There's a \"move to SD card\" option on some apps, but this version of Android actually only moves them from system storage to user-available internal storage (piracy protection).  Only photos, music and documents can be stored on the removable SD card.  512 mb RAM seems sufficient, but half that is usually already being used by \"services\" of some sort.Although the OD2 has the relatively ancient/low-end S1 chipset (Adreno 200 GPU), it's scorching fast on all 2D games and even handles up to mid-level 3D games.  4.1.2/Jellybean (\"Project Butter\") is significantly more efficient than previous Android versions, so I'm getting a surprisingly smooth 25 fps.  Multi-touch screen lets you use both hands to move and turn, simultaneously.  Built-in accelerometer allows phone to be used as a gesture controller to steer flight simulators and car/race games.Excellent Wifi reception...never thought I'd get internet speed this fast on a phone.  It's picking up our modem's signal...and 5 others in our neighborhood.  Love how it automatically finds hotspots (no extra app needed).  No need to activate phone to use Wifi and it was easy to set up with my home modem.  Turning both Wifi and data on/off is user friendly and quick.  Constant Wifi use drains the battery heavily and some games might stream from their website, so be prepared.Screen is the best, and worst, feature on this phone.  At 3.8\", it's the biggest Tracfone has ever had, but the resolution is very low/grainy.  It extends to practically all the phone's edges and has a respectable 3:2 aspect ratio (instead of 16:9 widescreen on current high-end phones), but viewing angles aren't great (not IPS).  Double-tap zoom and \"pinching\" lets you blow up web type, photos and online barcodes, but doesn't work on games (I can't even read the type on some games).  Built-in YouTube app works smoothly, but Android doesn't support Adobe Flash Player, so I haven't been able to get movies from other sites and streaming cams to play (you can download a flash browser...adding to the two non-removable, non-flash browsers that come with the phone).Call quality is fine...a little \"gargly\", but every cell phone I've had sounded the same.  Stereo and standard 3.5 mm jack are nice.  As usual, the external speaker (ear hole) is weak and tinny and only acceptable for calls.  However, music through a decent set of earbuds is as good as any quality MP3 player (o.k. bass) and even better through closed earphones.  Plays MP3, WAV, AAC and AMR (no WMA).Photos/video taken with this phone are dull...I'd only use them in an emergency.  For anything close to acceptable, you need good lighting and wipe the lens EVERY TIME!  Zoom yields poor VGA-like quality and blurry close-ups due to fixed focus lens.*  Adding to confusion, Android shows all photos and videos on internal storage, even when they're on the SD card (only when storage is viewed from Windows, do they show as being on the SD card).  When using the \"Import pictures and videos\" option on Windows, it only imported half my photos and entirely skipped my videos.  I was only able to transfer everything by using the \"Open device to view files\" option and then do a copy & paste.Marginal battery life.  Without Wifi, I get maybe two days of heavy use per charge.  No indicator light during battery charge or complete.  Battery icon is visible on screen when cable is first plugged in, but disappears when screen sleeps (you can keep checking by pressing the power button...or choose \"Stay Awake\" in settings).New \"recent apps\" capacitive button is cool...but the \"clear all\" button is too large and easy to accidentally press.The OD2 looks sleek.  It's half an inch thick, but rounded edges make it look slimmer.  Balanced/medium weight at 4.4 oz.  Impressive build quality; sturdy and convenient size.  It's not ridiculously big, which allows comfortable one-handed use.  Edges have slight texture, but get slippery with oily fingers.  I don't like the power and volume buttons directly across from each other, but I'm glad it doesn't have an external photo button because those frequently get pressed accidentally.*UPDATE: \"pic2shop Barcode & QR Scanner\" is a new app that works with fixed focus cameras.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Highly recommend!", "Author": "Phil R", "ReviewID": "RWRWASHBM4SQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received LG L39C Smartphone on 1 May, activated online @ Tracfone, transferred number and minutes from LG 840.

I do not know what the story is, I would think they would advertise the l39c as a front runner to their smart phone line?I purchasing on Amazon, the l39c phone + Einzige slim silicone shell case cover (designed for LG Optimus L4 II E440) + iLLumiShield screen protector. The phone and iLLumiShields arrived promptly and are perfect for each other (see my review for iLLumiShield / 3-26-14 - by Randy) The Einzige case arrived nearly two weeks later, after making microphone hole adjustments the case fits perfect (see review for Einzige / 3-26-14 - by Randy).The l39c has been labeled as entry level, and since this is my first smart phone, I do not have other smart phones to compare. Just a heads up, I do not talk on the phone much, text all day long, I search the web or stream video using Wi-Fi and not 3g data. My previous Tracfone LG 840g was an upgrade from my LG flip phone (a big improvement). Because the LG 840g had Wi-Fi with some web capabilities and at $8 a month, I told friends (paying hundreds of dollars more) it was a \"wise phone\" rather then a \"smart phone\". The new LG l39c is a true \"smart phone\" and I have not set it down since it arrived. The fact that it still cost $8 a month to operate makes it both a \"Smart and Wise phone\"!Transferring my existing Tracfone number and minutes went smoothly using my online account. A message said it may take 24 hours, but I think it was about an hour. All 2900 existing minutes transferred into the new Tracfone min/text/data tank as advertised 2900/2900/2900.The phone screen is noticeably larger, very responsive to touch and scrolls beautifully. The phone feels nice in my hand, but with a smooth plastic housing a rubber or silicone case is necessary. The Wi-Fi is stronger then my old LG 840g and connects to the house Wi-Fi automatically. The bluetooth is a lot better also, it connects automatically to my car's Garmin GPS w/bluetooth and all of my contacts show up perfectly in the Garmin phone book. Even if I change the bluetooth to the house stereo it will remember the car.I synced the LG calendar to Google calendar and synced Google calendar to my Mac iCal (it works great, see YouTube suggestion near bottom for help). Also, the email is very good and have both my Gmail and Comcast email all set up.Common complaints:* I know a lot has been said for battery life - I have charged it almost every night, but to be honest, I play with it all the time!* 3mp camera - still an upgrade from my old LG 840g 2mp camera (which took okay photos during the day).* No flash - battery would just drain faster with a flash anyways!* No facing camera - would have been nice for Skype, no loss concerning selfies!* Buttons on bottom don't light up - after playing with it for a couple of weeks I don't even look at the buttons!* My only REAL issue... I do not see any options for turning ascending (or fading) ring tones OFF.  It is a feature that gradually increases the ring tone from soft to loud. I tried the app \"Disable Increasing Ring\" and it kind of worked but it distorted the ring in weird ways and added lag time, so I Uninstalled it! If anyone has a solution, please post comment!Apps I installed and recommend (all Free):* Tracfone My Account. (slow but good, sends free text with tank info, wish it did it automatically when activated instead of asking me to see balance and then sending text)* Batter Doctor. (helps a lot in keeping battery draining apps in check!)* CM Security (Scans apps and data for virus, etc...)* Clean Master / One Tap Boost (App Manager, cleans junk files, boost memory )* Mobiwol (Firewall, Connection Logs, Data Usage)* AppMgr III (Great for sending movable apps to SD, fyi 32GB class 10)* Dropbox (great for transferring and organizing files from my mac)* OK Scan (UPC scanner, only works with the QR codes (square) not the UPC (vertical lines) codes* ViewRanger GPS (works well so far on tracking walks in the neighborhood. Looking forward to using it kayaking this summer.)* Facebook (Great, makes me want to use Facebook more often)* Sudoku Daily (very good, not easy)Also search for a great YouTube instructional by Adam Carroll on Syncing iCal (Mac calendar) to Google Calendar [...]Bottom line, the LG l39c is by far more superior to the LG 840g (and I liked the LG 840g!) and worth every penny!Would buy it again in a heart beat!Randy", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "I'm Glad I Didn't Have to Leave Tracfone -- To Get a Smartfone!", "Author": "Tech808", "ReviewID": "RUXAWJOREJTQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Where else can you have an Android for less than $7.00/mo?

They would not be reading this. I have been doing Tracfone (TF) for a long time. My average costs have been about $8/month for a phone since 2002 (about $1200 total phone costs for 12 years!). A friend has paid about $50/month over the same period ($7200). I am sold on the Tracfone approach. I buy a new phone about every 2 years - again without a worry. I bought this phone for $89, and got a year and 1200 minutes for about $100. So for less than $200 I have my next year of phone. So, I am up to $16/month all told for the next year. That will pretty much hold me. I average about 1500 minute a year, so I might have to add another card, but so what? I just traded up from a TF - LG 840g. The difference is amazing. This LG39C phone really does apps, it really connects to wifi, it really works in more places than the 840g. It's like night and day. I now feel like I have a smart phone. I connected to google and all my contacts were just there. If I need to add a new number I add it in google. You see, I am \"older\" and do not like to text on a phone. So, adding phone numbers would have been the worst part of getting a new phone. I was very pleased to have them already in my phone. Google also has Google Play, so I can \"buy\" the apps online and they go right to my phone automatically. I have yet to pay for an app. I just get the free ones like QR reader, Music player, LG TV remote, adobe reader, kindle, crackle, split the bill, tipping, video maker pro. yes a video ap...crazy. all free. So far I have been able to use wifi to connect to my internet needs so as not to use credits. NTL, I think this phone can be a hotspot if you need it. That will likely cost you.What don't I like? Well the power button is weird on the side. I liked it better on the top. Opposite the power button is the volume toggle. I am always changing the volume by mistake. This phone is slippery, so I have ordered a textured case. Maybe that will provide some button protection, as well. The camera has trouble focussing close up on bar codes. I wonder if I had a bad bar code, too small, or if the camera I got is not the top notch one. I will try to take some pict outside to see if I get as good a pictures as the 840g (which I liked for a phone camera).All in all, I am glad I did not keep pumping minutes into the old LG. This phone saves me time and anguish. The screen is bigger - again, for the older guy.  I really like this phone. I hear there is a \"block unwanted callers\" app. I will go look for that. (short pause) I just got that app installed in ten seconds by going to a google play window in this browser. QED. Wow, I would have screwed with the old phone for hours to find that.

Many of your reviews and suggestions have been helpful and I want to say thanks! (Esp. CAMPJEEP) Tracfone is our choice for out and about and trips at this time as we have opted to keep our landline.  I chose apps and took my time becoming familiar with the phone before I activated it with Tracfone.  I think that is a wise thing to do and takes some pressure off if you have the time. More pleasant I would say.First Apps to get:I would agree with others that it is important to get a security app right away.  I use Avast. Malware with that is a good option. The other apps I would download right away are Clean Master and App Manager III.  You also need to keep uninstalling the updates on the Google apps you are not using as they add up to a lot of storage.  With Clean Master they have a widget that does a quick junk removal right on your front page, or you can use the main one for more detailed storage removal.  The App Manager III has another cache storage of the apps that will allow you to remove more it you set it to cache.  I like it because it shows you in one place if an app can be moved and how much data and storage is used.  I have found it a very helpful app.There are some beautiful and amazing weather apps out there that really help you quick see what is happening and coming down the road.  For up North it is important!  I really enjoy the 1Weather App as it has many visuals and shows up on the main page. I have just tried the WeChat App out and love it!  Have not tried the phone aspect of WeChat yet.When looking for apps, you need to ascertain if the app can be used without pulling in data usage if you are off WIFI.  Sometimes they will make this clear and sometimes they won't.One of my favorite things to make it user friendly.(Please bear with my newbie enthusiasm all of you who are longtime android users)I love the voice search and the voice dictating options. If you hate trying to type out a TM, email, etc., try it!  You might like it! Just be sure to check your message before send off on email, chatting, etc. I have had a few hilarious word options come up, and maybe even a little embarrassing.  However, if you are talking clearly, it is surprisingly accurate. You can say question mark, period, etc. at the end of a sentence to get your punctuation if you are a purist.  Also, I do want to say that you can use the voice recording on the Memo App that comes with the phone, and it has no limits as far how long you can record.  That is nice for when you have a goodly amount of information you want to record.  The Memo App has some nice options.About Cases: My choice and 2 ideasI bought this for a temporary case and it fits very well. Gosear S Line Flexiblehttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F3X7UZW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1  The only thing is that the USB plugin needs to be cut out which is a minor matter.LADIES: Here is 2 fun ideas for you:You CAN personalize and decorate your plain clear case until you get the case of your dreams!  Here's how: Trace the case outline on decorative cardstock or paper, cut out the photo lens opening, place inside with the design facing outward, and you will have a darling looking case you can change out at a whim.  They do have clear cases I noticed for the L4II and that would show all colors better than my lavendar one. I chose a paper that looked fabulous with the light purple.The other item I bought for the phone was this cute and practical wallet for extra protection with one warning.  If you are going to keep your cover on the phone, you will need to get a size up.  I am currently waiting on my return replacement in a slightly larger size.  The company was very nice to deal with.  I like the fact it can carry a few credit cards, some cash and coin.  You cannot really actively operate the phone through the clear front without pressing hard, but you can see quickly what the call is about. It comes in fun color combinations.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HBGP592/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1Sorry, guys.  I do believe they have more neutral wallet styles out there, but you will need to look for yourselves.  :)Final thoughts:I am still learning and choosing options and trying the phone out. I found that my Pocket has too much storage on it at this point to be practical and am considering another read later app for just a light amount of phone reading (limit 20 articles, I promise! ;) ) I do have my Amazon Kindle Reading App on, but will be evaluating that.  The Amazon Cloud Music app didn't work for me because I have albums and they were just more that I wanted on the phone.  Maybe I didn't understand how to use it properly, and will try it later.But so far, I am having a great time!Just remember to clean your caches, move allowable apps to your SD, and uninstall the Google updates on Google apps you are not using.Enjoy!", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "best smart phone for the money", "Author": "John C Calhoun", "ReviewID": "R1S2Y4FANBLR96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best deal for someone who doesn't live on their phone 24x7.

Spychalla", "ReviewID": "R32UU7QV22D9QP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded to this phone after having a ZTE Valet for 3 weeks. What I noticed is that is doesn't have the Valets major issues of bad WiFi reception and crashing. The screen is a higher quality one than the Valet which had horrible contrast when in landscape mode. Being a video watcher, this phone's screen looks good no matter which way it's positioned. The WiFi never disconnected on me at a hotel recently, even when it said I only had one bar. The Valet at the same hotel on an earlier trip had a lot of trouble staying connected. The phone also seems faster than the Valet, even thought they have the same processor. The Valet used to stutter a lot, where this phone runs like butter in comparison. The CDMA signal strength seems to be about the same as the Valet, which is reasonable. The lack of a flash is not a deal breaker compared to the Valet, since the Valet's flash didn't seem to help at all from what I could see (I took a picture in a somewhat darker restaurant, and the pictures were barely visible with the flash turned on).Battery life is good, and easily lasts all day. Using it moderately, and staying overnight in a hotel, which included some WiFi usage, and using it as a media player for about an hour did not drain the battery much, I had a 3/4 charge by time I arrived home the next day.I recommend getting a screen protector, since unlike the LG 840G, the touchscreen is a soft plastic. Other things that were different than the ZTE:  1. My banks app actual runs on this phone (it crashed on the ZTE).  2. Videos play smoother with the default app.  3. The USB connector is better placed, being on the bottom.  4. The bluetooth worked much better with my PC (the Valet had trouble connecting).  Some other viewers mentioned it is slippery, having owned an iPhone 4 (ATT), I can say this is nowhere near as slippery. A case isn't a necessity, like it is with the iPhone which will slide down the very gentle slope of my laptop lid like it's on rollers.  What I hope LG does in the future is come out with an even higher end model for Tracfone (in the $200 range).

I have been a Tracfone customer for many years, in fact, my service end date is around 2025.  This phone does just about everything.  I can watch my home cam (I use the WIFI for heavy video or Netflix), Weather, email, any apps on Play Store, i run Norton mobile on it also with no problem in speed.  Its exactly what I have been waiting for from Tracfone.  Android 4.1 is perfect.  Great features at a great price.  Make sure you set your updates so they only work with WIFI.  There's an icon on top to do that for Mobile Data.  I turn it on when I want to run internet and than leave it off in general.I do not consider that a drawback since I am in control of what I spend and use.  I have watched my home cam, videos, and a ton of websites and have hardly used any data from my 600 MB i got with my phone.It uses the voice, data, and text time separately so your data time doesn't kill your talk time and you can add just data from a card or the website.This phone is amazingly economical.  I seriously laugh now when I see everyone else paying so much.  I still pay under 30 bucks a month for 4 YES FOUR phones to be active on the family plan.

While initially drawn to the ZTE Valet, at least in part due to the lower price and included flash, I ultimately decided upon the LG, even though it was more expensive than the other two.As represented in earlier reviews, I found the WIFI to be fairly sensitive. Reception was reasonably good using a wireless output about 50 feet and three rooms away. This is an important feature for a Tracfone in that use of cell tower data access can prove expensive. Since most folks select Tracfone due to its economy, the ability to reduce cell tower based data access through the use of WIFI would seem important. The relatively poor WIFI range reportedly associated with the ZTE Valet ultimately proved a disqualifying factor. Whereas the ZTE and LG supported WIFI b, g and n, the Samsung only supported b and g.The 3.8\" screen is a bit larger than the 3.5\" screen associated with the ZTE and Samsung phones. All three have the same resolution. As an additional plus, the LG exterior dimensions are roughly the same as the other two despite the larger screen. While the 320x480 resolution is not particularly good when compared with higher end Android phones, it is never the less very adequate for viewing MP4 movies. In the later regard, once two test feature length movies were tailored to the 320x480 resolution, they ran without incident (no small accomplishment for a single core processor).The LG and ZTE were supported by a single core 1GHz processor. The Samsung had the less powerful 800 MHz single core processor. While I didn't install any games on the LG, it performed well running multiple apps in addition to Norton Anti-virus.The LG and ZTE come with Android 4.1.x, whereas the Samsung uses Android 4.0. The LG uses a  more generic Android operating system, whereas the Samsung, based upon my experiences with my Samsung 10\" Tab 2, presumably does not. The LG is reportedly easier to flash if deemed ultimately necessary.While not always the case, Amazon appears to have the lowest price I've found on the LG. The LG is $129 on Tracfone's website and unavailable at Walmart. Interestingly enough, the Samsung was $79 at Amazon, and $129 at Tracfone and Walmart.Virtually all cell phone cameras are poor. From what I been given to understand, at least one of the higher end Windows phones may be an exception. Ultimately, even a higher megapixel value is not likely to compensate for the small size and quality of the lenses associated with phone cameras. To this end, none of the three evaluated were reported to be anything but adequate for anything more than social network posting. Even the ZTE Valet, which alone has a flash, is not likely to give good results in reduced lighting situations according to the pictures I saw. The ZTE may has adequate flash potential if the subject is only a few feet away. All of the three had fixed focus lenses.Even with a lens protector installed, the LG capacitive screen was very sensitive. The extra screen size no doubt helped, but still made selecting letters often hit and miss for an adult male's fingers. Consider buying a stylus for any of these Android Tracfones. Having a stylus built into the phone, as it was in the Motorola 124G, would have been welcome.The LG GPS appears reasonably accurate (accuracy of 5 yards with 12 satellites) for a phone. Still, if you want accuracy, consider buying a stand alone Garmin GPS. Like the camera, a phone based GPS is good when nothing else is available. Andriod application Maverick, which is free (I downloaded mine from Amazon apps), seems to work particularly well with the LG GPS, even without WIFI or cell tower assistance.Battery life is fairly good on the LG, although active use of the GPS and WIFI are likely to substantially reduce endurance. I was impressed with the size of the LG battery, which was much larger than that associated with the Motorola 124g feature phone previously in use. You'll need to charge the phone for a couple of hours prior to use, Thereafter, no more than about 90 minutes should be required to bring it up to 100%.I've given the phone four stars because of the following deficiencies. The navigation buttons on the bottom are not back lighted. The LG does provide an additional button (apps listing) over the three provided by the Samsung and ZTE. Unlike the ZTE, neither the Samsung or LG has a flash. The LG screen is reported by one reviewer to be glass and another to be plastic; the manual doesn't say although I suspect as a lower end Android it is plastic. Some have complained the phone is too smooth to hold effectively, but I haven't found that to be the case personally.

My experience with Tracfone so far has been very positive.What I don't like:The capacitive touch buttons on the bottom of the front of the phone are not backlit. However, this phone has an additional button not found on the zte. It is a \"recent apps\" button that makes it real easy to go to a recent app or close all open apps. After a couple of days, I no longer missed the backlit buttons on the zte. I use the 4 buttons so often that I don't need to see them to use them. Also, The camera is not very good. It does not have a flash like the zte. But I don't take a lot of photos with my phone so that's not a big deal for me but it may be for you.All in all, I am very happy with this phone!", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Waited until the price was reasonable for a smart phone and it was worth it.", "Author": "Arthur L.

Unlike the Centura, this one keeps perfect time!One thing I really like about this phone is the drop down Notifications bar that is at the top of the settings screen. It makes it easy to switch from wifi to data, for example. Other settings available on the Notifications screen are Airplane, Power Saver, Sync, screen Rotation, GPS, Bluetooth, Sound, Quick Memo.The screen display is bright and sharp. It's also very responsive, even when using a plastic screen shield.3G performance is acceptable. Although there are locations where there are a couple of bars, I haven't had any dropped calls.I only use WiFi at home. As with 3G, sometimes the signal level shows as being low, but it always stays connected to my router, which is important to me because I listen to Internet radio quite a bit via TuneIn and iHeart.I also use it as a music player on my home stereo.The phone has never frozen or locked up as the Samsung was constantly doing.Battery life could be better. However, if I used the phone mostly as a phone instead of a multifunction device, I suspect it would be fine.The major quibble I have with this phone over the Samsung is that there is no way to set data usage limits. So if you aren't careful and you don't set apps to update only over WiFi, you could run out of data unexpectedly.Physically, the phone's size is just about right.

Research and reviews led me to choose the LG L39C.  I am very pleased - and surprised - by the phone.  Most of the issues I might have are really with the way the services work, etc.The good:1.  The phone itself is great - I did change the installed 4GB micro SD card to a 32GB card. The phone comes with a mini-USB to USB cable and a USB electrical outlet adaptor as the charging device.  You can use the USB cable to connect to a computer;  I have a mac and was able to download an android phone transfer utility to my mac;  I can simply connect the phone and transfer any files I want (music, documents, etc.).2.  Switching from my old phone to the new one was very easy and relatively quick.  My old phone still worked so I was able to complete the transfer online.  From start to finish it took just over an hour for the phone number and all minutes/texts/data to transfer correctly and the new phone to be active.  Note that the site says the transfer could take several days.  However, the site did state that the old phone would be active until the number transferred.3.  It works very well with wifi - I've hardly had to use data.  A plus is that you can set the system to automatically switch between wifi and data or you can turn one or both of them off so that the phone doesn't connect to either.  You do have control over data usage.4.  Charges quickly using the charger provided;  will charge more slowly if connected to a computer or if the usb cable is in any adapter other than the one provided with the phone.  Holds a charge OK but will deplete quickly if you use apps heavily.5. The android 4.1 JellyBean system is somewhat intuitive and easy to use.  I like the status menu bar at the top that you can swipe down to give you access to easily turn options on and off.6.  So far phone quality has been good - I've been able to receive calls in my office building that have dropped or not gotten through before.  Most likely because this phone uses a different network than my previous phone.7.  Screen size is good and larger than my old itouch (one of the first to come out) or my hubby's old iphone.  It does switch between portrait and landscape rather easily.  Typing on the \"keyboard\" is easier in landscape (sideways) position.Issues:1. Getting the balance of minutes is rather more difficult than it needs to be.  You can download an app, but then you have to be comfortable with tracfone having almost complete access to your phone (they probably do anyway...).  Which brings me to the next issue..2. As with any item that connects to the internet, take the time to learn what settings the phone comes with and what level of sharing your information you are comfortable with.  Most of the apps will want some access to the information on your phone - that's to be expected and necessary in some cases, but you need to be comfortable with that.  Be sure to look at the list of permissions requested before installing an app.  Some apps asked for permission to view my call logs and contacts - can't imagine why - so I've decided I really don't need those apps.3.  Not really an issue, but you will need to have a google account to really use this phone to its potential.  I already had a google account, so it was straightforward to setup.4. So far the non-backlit hard keys on the bottom of the phone have not been an issue, but it is rather tedious trying to find the right button in lower lighting.5. The camera, as noted by others, is just OK.  I don't really use a camera phone for serious pictures so it's not a big deal for me.  It's fine for the occasional shot I might want for future reference, but not for documenting important events (weddings, etc.)Other:  I did get a screen protector and a case for it.  As noted by others, the phone is nicely sleek and fits well in a small hand, but can slip out if not careful.  I chose a case that doesn't add bulk but seems to \"stick\" to my hand well.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Tracfone", "Author": "Craig Turner", "ReviewID": "RTVS9T9ZHYBGZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Moved up from the previous \"best\" Tracfone LG840G and glad we did (my wife and I).

Smallish screen compared to new other network smartphones, but not bad.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perhaps the perfect \"Starter\" smartphone", "Author": "H. Keller", "ReviewID": "RZBO6GZ0XTDY9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a Tracfone customer since the late 90s, and have gone through two analog phones and two previous digital phones. This is my first smartphone. As disclaimer: I'm a Mac guy. If Apple offered a cheap iPhone and an affordable plan, I'd be using one. That being noted, I am pretty satisfied with this product.Some thoughts, in no special order:Battery time: Just leaving it on, or limited on/offs during the work day usually drained about 75 percent of the battery by the end of the day. As a plus, it recharges fairly quickly (somewhere between one to two hours). My previous Motorola phones were generally plug it in and let it charge overnight affairs.Images: Easy to download images for the gallery, or as images for contacts. The manual that comes with the phone is good and there is a lengthy, in-depth manual available on-line for free. Google \"LG L39C manual,\" click the link and a pdf will automatically download. You can find most of your detailed answers in there.Setting your voice message: Tried to do this at work (one bar) and it would not pick up my name when I spoke it. It just sounded like static. Tried it at home (three bars) and it recorded fine.Ringtones: Can't download ringtones (A mild disappointment). I was going to have some fun with this option only to discover it wasn't an option at all.E-mails/messages easy to compose/send/read replies. Yes the keys are small, but turn the screen sideways and they will be a bit larger.Camera leaves a bit to be desired. My impression is that there is a very limited ability to control stability and if not fuzzy (out of focus), indoor shots tended to be too murky. Not as sharp as my five-year-old Kodak, but then I didn't buy the phone for the camera, I bought it to make calls and check the weather!Very easy to download apps from the Google store. You might want to look into buying 32GB micro-SD to install for extra memory capability.Downloading \"stuff\": You will want to keep an eye on how much you download in both capacity of the phone, and the number of your download points.Like many new users, I'm waiting for a good skin/cover for it. I want something that fits, not something I have to cut to fit. I would have thought LG would have timed the arrival of the phone with the release of third-party covers/cases/skins.As far as the phone goes, other than the usual getting used to various buttons, controls, and functions, it has met my expectations. The sound of incoming and out-going calls is good, and I've sent myself e-mails from my desktop just to time it, and gmail bloops at me shortly after I hit the computer's send button.The only bump in the road came when activating the phone. Just letting you know, this may take some time to move your old Tracfone number and minutes to the L39C.A family member started the process of transferring the number and minutes from her dumb Tracfone to the L39C on a Friday and it wasn't completed until the next Tuesday (a robo call told her it was done and for her to finish the Google registration process).I started on a Saturday and it wasn't done the next Wednesday. The old phone was still active and had all my minutes and service time. I contacted Tracfone and they manually moved the number, but only 2700 of the 5200 minutes I had, transferred to the new phone. This resulted in a series of calls, e-mails, and web chats through Sunday night. I even sent them a photo of my old phone still showing the minutes. In the end, Tracfone did right by me and I laud them for it, though the minutes are still on my de-activated Motorola.So if you experience a lag, you won't be alone. You will also not be phoneless, because your old phone will remain functioning until the SIM is de-activated or de-registered by Tracfone.So, am I happy? Yes, with the price, the phone, and the phone signal quality. Oh, and I believe I paid $24 less getting it through Amazon than I would have through Tracfone.UPDATE: the only problem I've encountered since the review is that photos seem to randomly disappear from the photo gallery. Not sure why, it seems random - often the thumbnail remains, but the large image is the broken image icon. So I have a folder on my computer with the images I loaded, and every day (literally) I've been re-emailing and downloading the missing pics, a bit annoying, but it might take a half star off ...

Its a pain to text without the full keyboard though.  So I decided to take the plunge and get a smart-phone.  Overall its a good phone and I'm learning how to use it. Can't beat the price point for a casual user. The sound quality on calls is slightly less clear than on my old slide-phone.  I had to order a case that was made for another phone, but it fits this one, except for the microphone hole at the bottom.  Even though the case covers the microphone hole, it doesn't seem to interfere with picking up my voice.  Cons -  minutes and the voicemail notification are not shown on the screen.  I have to actually go into the tracfone app and press update to see how many tracfone minutes I have left.  The home screen shows missed calls, but it doesn't show if a voicemail was left.  So I have to remember to check the voicemail widget constantly to see if there is anything in my voicemail box.  I also bought this same phone for my son and he likes to download games from the google playstore.  His phone seems to run out of internal memory a lot even though he has moved everything he can from the internal memory to the SD card and clears data and cache frequently.

This L39C is my wife's new phone while I'm still using an LG 440G Prepaid Phone With Double Minutes (Tracfone) flip phone.I have a review posted for the LG 440G.  The 440G flip phone still offers better voice quality with fewer signal strength issues in my area.  This might be because the 440G runs on the ATT GSM service versus the Verizon CDMA service for this L39C.  However, the 440G flip phone is very bare bones once you look beyond voice communications.  It can receive email but can't send it.  My 440G doesn't even replace my dedicated MP3 player because there's no good way to import MP3 files, or any external files for that matter.  Forget maps or the web.This LG L39C is a step down on voice quality and service area from my 440G flip phone, but it is a very full featured device as long as your needs don't include a good camera or hardware add-ons.  I'll discuss the hardware issues later in this review.You don't have to spend a lot for an LG L39C.  My wife's came in a bundle with a one year Tracfone airtime card and a case and car charger.  A one year Tracfone card costs 100 USD and I've never seen it discounted.  My wife's bundle was 148 USD, making the L39C with case and car charger effectively 48 USD.  See the review by A.Wiersch dated 5/11/2014 for more info.It's amazing how much the L39C offers.  It's internal hardware includes a Bosch 3 axis accelerometer, orientation sensor, and magnetic field sensor.  GPS is included, although the ability to use the Russian GLONASS satellites is absent.  Wi-Fi connectivity is very good and includes the N protocol, but not the new AC protocol.  The battery is user replaceable, a big plus in my book.Triple minutes for life are included with this smartphone.  A one year Tracfone card comes with 400 minutes at face value, which get tripled by the L39C to 1200 minutes talk, 1200 texts, and 1200 MB of data.A 4 GB microSD card is pre-installed.  However, the L39C will accept up to a 32 GB microSDHC card and I would advise you to upgrade to one immediately upon receipt of your L39C.  It's easiest to swap the cards at inception so that nothing has to be transferred from the old card to the new one.  You'll want the space if you're going to load 2GB of offline maps, 10GB+ of MP3 tracks, plus have room left over for a movie or two for the plane.  I bought a G.Skill 32GB Micro SDHC Flash Memory Card (FF-TSDG32GN-C10) for 13.50 USD shipped.  Smaller and/or slower cards don't save enough money to be worthwhile so you may as well max out the L39C's storage capacity.  You can always transfer the card to your next phone or camera.There's a lot you can do with an L39C.  Email is easy to type.  Better still, shut off mobile data to save on Tracfone network costs and there's still a lot available.  Use the L39C for offline GPS maps and navigation.  Install a magnetic compass app.  Map your hike or bicycle ride using the GPS for approximate speed and distance information.  View the night sky with a star map app.  Share files via DropBox.  Transfer your MP3 files via a USB connection from your laptop computer and ditch the dedicated MP3 player.  Etc., etc.  This L39C easily earns a five star rating for its value versus price.  Asking for more is like asking for fries with that.However, I am that person who would like more, and there are some hardware limitations.First and foremost, BlueTooth is limited to the old and obsolete 3.0 protocol.  I had hoped to use the LG39C with the MapMyRide bicycle cyclometer app and a heart monitor chest strap, plus cadence and mileage/speed sensors.  This isn't possible because all current cadence, mileage/speed, and power sensors require BT 4.0 or at least ANT+.  You may be able to pair the L39C with the obsolete Zephyr HxM Bluetooth Wireless Heart Rate Sensor for Android and Windows Phone 8 which uses BT 3.0, but most fitness apps won't support the combination.  Don't confuse the older Zephyr HxM that I've linked to with the newer and less expensive versions that require BT 4.0.Worse, USB On The Go (a/k/a USB OTG or USB On-The-Go) isn't available, at least not by default.  USB OTG is basically Android-speak for a fully functional USB port that can be used much as you would use the USB port on a laptop computer.  For example, you can't plug a USB flash memory stick or a portable hard drive into the LG39C even if you use a micro USB male to USB-A female adapter cable with external power.  That means that you also can't use a USB dongle to pick up ANT+ connectivity.  See my 5/30/2014 comment to this review for the OTG post-mortem.The LG39C doesn't have an IR port to control a TV or home entertainment system.Also, the camera feature is barely there.  There's no screen facing camera so this isn't a device to use with Skype.  The rear facing camera is OK for outdoor snapshots but the quality is low, plus there's no flash and no focusing mechanism at all.  Lack of focus means you can't scan barcodes, at least not very well.One of the real selling points for good smartphones is that you can leave your dedicated shirt pocket camera at home.  The L39C won't free you from lugging around a separate camera.So, appreciate the LG L39C for what it can do, not what it can't.Being a bit OCD with my introduction to the Android OS, I've researched the Android ecosystem to death since getting the LG 39C.  I'll post a series of comments to this review over the course of the next few weeks to save you the hours I'll never get back.  Each comment will be listed below as they're added.(1) My first comment (5/10/2014) discusses rooting my L39C.(2) Greenify is the most useful utility I've found.  It allows you to hibernate apps that don't need to be running constantly.  Greenify provides its greatest benefit on a rooted phone that spends most of its time on standby waiting for incoming calls.  Standby time is now 5-7 days between charges.

You can't buy any of these three without also buying the other two!  And texts no longer use 0.3 minutes, they use a whole \"text minute.\"  (How can an SMS message that is 160 characters (or less) be considered equivalent to a megabyte of data!)If Tracfone wants to count voice/data/sms separately, then they need to sell them separately, too.  They already sell \"data only\" minutes for these phones, so why not texts?Unless they change this, I am not sure what to do, because it will roughly double my airtime charges, making Tracfone more expensive than a monthly plan from another provider.

When I found out they were offering an Android type phone I was excited to upgrade so I could use the internet if I needed to. My previous phone was a basic LG500 with a blackberry type keyboard which always worked well for what I wanted. I was able to transfer my number and minutes no problem. After using the LG Optimus for a few months I wish I had my old phone back. Here are some of the problems I've had. The keyboard is not usable. Try to tap a letter and you may get it or you may get one of many letters around it, or you may get the letter 2 or 3 or more times. The only way I can send a text is with the voice recognition feature which is pretty neat after I figured out how to use it. I can't answer calls. It worked fine when I got it then when I tried to swipe to answer it wouldn't work. My sister has the same phone and she told me to take out the battery and reinstall it after a minute and it would answer normally. She was right, it worked, for 2 days now it won't answer again. A few days ago at 7 in the morning the phone starts blaring out a startling noise. Thinking the alarm was turned on I picked it up and there was a text about an amber alert in a city 300 miles south of where I live. No problem a few hours on the internet and I was able to disable this unwanted annoyance. Set up your gmail on your phone will alarm every time you get an email message. No problem, a few visits to help forums and you can figure out how to disable another annoying helpful feature. Battery life between charges I would say is 10% of my old phone capability. The list goes on and on. Unfortunately I already donated my old phone but am seriously thinking about buying another one. This phone has a lot of interesting features which you could spend hours researching, but if what you want to do is send texts and answer incoming calls don't buy it.Update: After contacting Tracphone and Tech help at LG I did a reset twice and am still unable to answer calls. Amazon says I can't exchange after 30 days so I'm stuck with this thing. There is obviously something wrong with the touch screen. Very disappointed.Last update: After 3 months of frustrations and missed calls, I bought a ZTE Valet tracphone (on sale at Target or I would write a good review on it). It is cheaper than the LG was and works perfectly. Easy to type on, no more missed calls. It rings, you can answer it. There was a problem with the LG from the beginning but it worked sporadically and I was not familiar with Androids so it took a while to figure out it was defective.

During that time I have not received a satisfactory response from their overseas \"customer service\". I activated the LG39C on April 18th. The first issue was when I transferred (ported) my number and minutes to the new phone, Tracfone instead assigned a new number, which was based in Texas. I am in Mass.. It required multiple calls before my original number was activated to the new phone. When I went to the Tracfone web site to check my balances I found a different number listed on my account, which prevented me from accessing my account information. These issue required additional calls to correct this problem. It took until the following Wednesday and over 5 hours to correct these issues. On April 22 after thinking that the issues with the phone and Tracfone were resolved and I could use the phone I came to the next issue. That being the battery not maintaining a charge, which left the battery dead in 6 hours. On Wednesday 4/30 I attempted to have a new battery sent via live chat, only to be disconnected 4 separate times. On 5/1 I called the corporate headquarters and spoke with \"customer service\" who stated that they would mail a new battery that I would receive on Friday 5/2, which wasn't received. On Saturday 5/2 I found the phone becoming hot, which required me to shut it off. At this point the battery was down to 14% charge after only 6 hours. On 5/4 I again had to call Tracfone to request a new phone due to an apparent short which is causing the battery to over heat and shorten the battery life. I then attempted to reactivate my LG840G while waiting for the replacement phone. Yet another call to Tracfone because the web site would not work to transfer the time/minutes to the LG840G. This only to be told that the 840G could not be reactivated without a new SIM card being mailed out. This due to the phone having been previously activated. (Doesn't make sense not looking for a new number but activating my old phone with the number previously used with it.) When asked what I am supposed to use for a phone while I wait for the replacement, I was advised to borrow a phone from someone else. (And then what do they use?) I am off to buy a phone that I can use until I receive the replacement phone. Later this week a trip to court to file suit against Tracfone. Perhaps if others do this they might address what they laughingly call customer service. As of this review I have spent over 8 hours attempting to resolve Tracfones issues. On 5/7/14 instead of receiving the replacement phone as promised I received an envelope to return the defective phone. Another call only to be informed that the defective phone must be returned before a new phone is shipped. The first \"CS\" person didn't know this? Tracfone has definitely reached their level of incompetence!", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dont buy this phone It will break in 90 days", "Author": "A7", "ReviewID": "R2XYSOQ1IZTPYG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update 5/31/2014I didnt want to comment here till all was said and done whether I was able to get a new phone or not to replace the broken one so here is what happened. Basically I was trying to contact tracfone and some of you were trying to be helpful which I appreciate however the phone numbers did not work for me. One was disconnected and the other I kept getting a busy signal. The only way I was able to get tracfone customer support at all was through the \"forgot my password\" stuff and finally was able to get into contact with someone there and they were able to help me. They sent a prepaid box with an envelope to ship the phone back which makes sense however it forced me to go without a mobile phone for about a week so no one at all could call me. Most places I have used have enough faith in their customers to send a replacement then expect the other defective unit back. That way the customer isnt without a device for a week like I was. Anyway after all of that and finally getting a new phone today I start it up and get everything working but then...the replacement phone has the same DAMN problem 3g not working. So I wasted that time expecting they would fix the issue when all they did was send me another broken phone with the same problem. Now I was a loyal tracfone user but given all this and the inability to actually speak to someone unless I go through this weird little loophole I just have to say screw tracfone. They were good and they did try to help but it seems like they do their damndest to make themselves inaccesible to the customers so they dont have to help you. I should also like to mention when I finally was able to speak to a live person I had to wait on hold for 2 HOURS and thats not even counting the time it took for the person to say \"one second I need to check something\" which basically meant it will be another 10 minutes. After telling them upfront what the problem is and them not just believeing me and making me test all sorts of stuff when I already told them I had tried it multiple times I spent about a little over 6 hours with tracfone customer support just to get them to believe what I was saying was true. If you cut out all that including being on hold the entire time wouldve been 15 minutes. I mean really I wish I was joking. I have been a loyal tracfone customer for the longest time but this just tore it for me. This whole experience was just infuriating to an insane degree. I dont even have to wait in line for the dmv for 2 hours. All I can say is this phone is going up on the all well known auction site (little e big B)with the stipulation 3g doesnt work and ill be done with tracfone for good. All I can say after all of this is do not buy anything $50 plus for tracfone service or you might be wasting your money. The saddest thing and most infuriating is my mom's lg dynamic 1 while it has memory limitations actually works better in nearly every capacity than my lg dynamic 2 which cost $80 more at the time I purchased it. I was hoping to come on here and simply say \"all is well it works now\" but nope that didnt happen. Now ive got to do some quick research and buy a phone from some other company in the hopes they will be at least a bit better. Finally I will say this to tracfone...Your company sucks now and you have lost a long time loyal customer. Get your customer service straight and at least check your replacement phones before you send them out. Worst of all is the time on hold. I could have taken a small nap and still have been on hold within that 2 hours. This is not how you should do business at all.This phone was great at first and seemed like the perfect smartphone for me and on the tracfone network to boot. Everything was going good and I was saving a bundle until about 90 days later the 3g just stopped working. I tried everything from full discharging the battery to factory reset erasing all data and even driving around hoping to get a signal (Of course for safety someone else drove while I was looking at the phone). After many many futile attempts it has become apparent that the 3g just suddenly died. I tried to get in contact with tracfone but they wont help me. They wont let me return the phone to them for another because I bought it on amazon and its way past the 30 days so I cant return it to the seller etiher. I thought ok maybe its not so bad ill just use it to make calls and text when im not near wifi but now today all of a sudden it wont even make calls or texts anymore. The texts never get delivered and upon calling a voice says \"please enter the phone number again\". Now for the phone number I thought ok ill just try using it with and without the 1 that is sometimes used for long distance calls but neither worked and I know the number absolutely works because as soon as I tried to call on the cell phone I checked the call log to make sure it was the right number then I called that same number on the house phone and got through just fine. Now it would make sense if say I got zero signal where I am and thats why it didnt work but I have MAX amount of bars well better than any phone ive had in a while but still the calls wont go through. This phone has not been abused at all and in fact has been babied as I know from experience some phones break easily. This phone had all the features I needed but since it died way before a normal phones expected 2 year life it gets 1 star. I just hope no one else buys this phone as it will eventually wind up being a $100 paperweight. Please I beg you look at another phone because this one absolutely sucks.

Get the $14.95 flip phone, it has the same useful capabilities  as this one and it's alot less expensive.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not for me", "Author": "Hawk", "ReviewID": "RMX05NDVCSKMI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I reviewed all the android cell phones. This LG is fairly new and spec's were high. The few reviews gave it a high rating. But, I had it for about 15 days and then when calls came in, I swiped the screen but it wouldn't connect me. Then after a while the screen started freezing up and I couldn't receive or make calls. I had to take the battery out several times before the screen would reboot. I decided I didn't need to carry another computer around with me and didn't need one that froze up.

Please share this. If you are a Tracfone user and are thinking of switching to their Android phones...DON'T. We purchased an Android Tracfone for my daughter at Christmas thinking it would be nice for her to have the extra capabilities next year on campus. Triple minutes...sounds great too. On her previous phone a 120 minute card tripled was 360 minutes. A text was 1/3 of a minute so she got 1080 texts. On the new Android phones you get 120 phone minutes, 120 texts, and 120 data minutes. Since my daughter usually texts she was out of texts and had added enough air time to have over 1000 talk minutes built up. We decided to transfer her back to her old phone figuring she could at least use those minutes up before getting a different service. They transferred her number, but the Android phone contract does not allow for transfer of minutes. No service rep (and I talked to too many in the transfer process)mentioned that, and the first rep actually said they WOULD transfer. Her new phone from a different carrier arrives today. They have lost one customer from this family and once my minutes are gone I will be considering new carriers as well.
