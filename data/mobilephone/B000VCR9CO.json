I sent the phone to HTC's RMA department, they said the LCD was brocken and repaired it for no warranty. I received the phone back and 3 weeks later my screen is once again white and can't do anything with it. I really don't recomment this brand because I always treated the phone good so I don't see I am responsible for the fail.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "AWESOME PHONE!!!", "Author": "Cesar Rodriguez \"...\"", "ReviewID": "R2SML6NAJT8QN3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Incredible Machine. 100% with all features.
