{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Don't hesitate to buy because it's windows mobile.", "Author": "Sasha Merced \"Yndirah\"", "ReviewID": "R2RU05S7JC838", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was hesitant to buy this phone because I had bad experiences with Windows Mobile in the past, but now I love this phone.  It worked great with winmo 6.1, and works even better after installing winmo 6.5.  It has only frozen once, and it was after 2 full days of installing .cab files for customizing the system.  The HTC Sense looks great, and I think the weather animation on the home page is really cool, and you can customize it pretty much any way you want. I actually have a friend that has an iphone and she loved the way my phone looked because even my system fonts are customized. You can sync your phonebook to your facebook and MSN contacts, and you can see your contacts facebook albums from the phonebook as well. I don't care much for any facebok apps for any phone I've tried though, including this one, so I just use facebook mobile.  If you install the Safari browser, you have flash and the option to see full versions of websites instead of the mobile versions.  The camera takes good, clear pictures and video. And the keyboard is the best in it's class!  Great for business users, you can review your slides and even do the entire presentation from your phone using the jetset presenter.  It also has a business card scanner that automatically scans and stores business card information to your phonebook, and it has a remote desktop application as well.  The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because I like the Palm calendar better, and the chat style messaging is not as organized and neat as the Palm Centro neither.  I also like Documents to go better than the Office mobile, the Office mobile version is very limited and won't support some file types, but you can actually add the Docs to go if you like. Otherwise, I don't regret getting this phone at all.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "HTC makes some pretty good phones", "Author": "Happy Dad", "ReviewID": "R2NC0SHYC42YN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is starting to flake out now, but I've had it for a long time and it was a good purchase", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the busy person who likes windows mobile apps.", "Author": "Demian Garcia-Monroy", "ReviewID": "R23RJ2ZF2IP2EZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is like a mini computer.

Like any complex phone it took me a while to get used to it. I've had the phone for a little over 2 years now.Things that I like about the phone:* Spreadsheets & Word programs* Sliding keyboard* GPS* Weather application (this is so cool!)* internet capable with Explorer & a browser that works better with cell phone data exchange* Wi-fi capability* Calendar (so easy to put information in and it has options like 'occurring once a year' for birthdays and anniversaries & 'occurring every #day for classes or something. Even has an alert that can be programed to up to 1 day before the event to remind you)* customized backgrounds, ringtones can even customize a ringtone for individual contacts! I use this for my family members and friends so I know who's calling without even looking at the phone* can use a micro-SD card* camera and video* it's a mp3 player!* alarm system that allows up to three different alarm times and is also programmable to go off only on certain days.* blu tooth capable* sync with outlook programs on your computer (contacts, calendar, etc)* email!!! even multiple accounts* voice commands* touch screen; can use finger or stylus* facebookThings I don't like about the phone:* The battery life does seem short although after 2 years, it's probably because the battery is losing it's integrity.* To put the back cover back on the phone you have to remove the stylus. Mediocre, but I find it a pain.* GPS uses up a lot of the battery. So I suggest getting a car charger and hook the phone up so it doesn't cut out on you during a long trip. Learned this the hard way.* sometimes the voice commands don't work all that well, especially in noisy places.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Junk Phone", "Author": "FlowerPower", "ReviewID": "RGRXK9523OYGG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I phone was used as stated but it is a junk phone the sound is worthless miss 95% of calls.
